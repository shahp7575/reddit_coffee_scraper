For all these 12 years she’s always been worried about calling and talking to me, and going for coffee, and even got bothered if I forgot to call her every now and then. Granted we never had the best relationship and we are emotionally locked apart from each other. Very few times she tried to talk to me about coming back but I never gave her much space or opportunity for that.

Over the last 6 months, she hasn’t called, she sent me 2 very “dry” messages asking how I was, but never answers when I suggest coffee and never picks up the phone.

Has something shifted or has there been any recent communication about shunning family members or something? I know shunning in family was already a thing back when I was in, but this just feels off, all of a sudden it’s impossible to get to her, but if that is the reason, at least now I know.",1,1729879923.0,exjw,0,1.0,False

I’m trying to make some new friends, who I can hangout with and have a nice dinner occasionally, talk and discuss about anything (I’m pretty intuitive, I like listening to people talking about things and learning good things from that). I’m a geek about soccer (I like to call it football, no hate), cricket, and lately basketball as well. I love music, any kinds but a huge fan of 70s classic rock music (I collect vinyls). I like going out on hikes, I love coffee, love going to the beach and just chilling and watching sunsets, but also love staying in and watching something on Netflix or HBO. I play fifa on my ps5 also (so all fifa heads, hmu).

1gc0r8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gc0r8g/i_dont_think_the_substance_is_a_feminist_film/,I don’t think The Substance is a feminist film,"I was interested in going to see The Substance because lately I’ve felt self-conscious about aging and have wrestled with taking more dramatic steps to ensure I continue to benefit from the privileges of being young and attractive. But leaving the movie, I didn’t feel seen… I felt worse. I could tell the impact of the movie had been a setback on an emotional level before I could put it into words – the sight of an elderly woman at a coffee shop the next day felt like a jumpscare. 

Then I remembered that the way Elizabeth’s finger was aged as a punishment/consequence for the excessive pleasure taken by her younger self – wishing to continue a sexual encounter, she decides to siphon away the lifeforce of her older self and deal with the consequences later. The take-home is reminiscent of incel-esque messaging about the unchecked promiscuity of young women leading to being “ran-through” – the more pleasure and sexual experiences women have, the more they will physically deteriorate and drain their attractiveness away. 

Over the course of the movie, we come to feel a sense of contempt/pity rather than empathy for both the proud, selfish, and deeply fearful Sue (throughout the movie, she has nightmares and anxiety about being exposed, humiliated, losing control over her body) and pathetic, ashamed and self-sabotaging Elizabeth.

The implication of the movie is almost that Elizabeth should have quietly retreated into obscurity instead of fighting to stay relevant. That you’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t. I did not find this message hopeful and it didn’t leave me with any new feelings about coming to terms with aging under patriarchy/capitalism. 

The depicted horrors of female aging – even though they’re satirized – feel like a straightforward (if exaggerated) regurgitation of pop culture messaging rather than commentary or analysis. 

I did find the movie entertaining, but truly good films help me understand my own life in a deeper, more complex way. For me, this wasn’t one of them. Yes, it’s supposed to be a parody, but the joke felt like it was on Elizabeth and Sue. Interested in hearing other perspectives though (especially from other women).

I’ve been more consistent but definitely not perfect. Mostly OMAD, but I haven’t prevented myself from enjoying food with friends/family at any point. Because what’s the point of this weight loss journey if I can’t enjoy myself? This has probably been why the last ~5lbs have been difficult to lose, but this lifestyle feels sustainable to me. Most days of the week I do OMAD with allowances to enjoy life (whether that be brunch with a friend, or a seasonally flavored coffee, etc)

I love seeing everyone’s progress and I enjoy lurking here because there’s such a sense of community. It’s like having quiet support from so many strangers all rooting for each other.

1gc0iin,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gc0iin,Catpuccino ( Phancy ) - A Peppy Review ,"I had a crappy day last week and got some Phancy Slimes to treat myself! This time, I snagged Catpuccino and Mysterious Alchemist! My birthday is around the corner and Phancy also sent me their Birthday Cake slime and a full size of their blueberry wax melts as extras! Thank you SO much for those!!! I can't wait for the November drop next week so I can use up my birthday money hehehe. I also received a lovely personalized birthday note from them on adorable stationary I'll be sticking in my memory box! 💜 

Today, we have Catpuccino! This is a DIY kit with a Soufflé texture base and three clear toppers. Additionally, there are cat paw fimo slices and a pair of white cat ear charms to stick on top! The base is scented like spiced vanilla and the three toppers are caramel, espresso, and hot chocolate! I won't do a waxing poetic about the scents because they are very simple and straightforward! I like the spiced vanilla a LOT. It's so pleasant when you open the container and mingles well with the scents selected for the toppers. 

Onto the texture! Soufflé is new to me but it seems to be thick and kind of like a butter or cloud dough but not as heavy as a cloud dough. It's almost like a matte thick and glossy if I had to make a comparison. It doesn't drizzle but it stretches, inflates, spreads, and swirls beautifully. It's quite light and airy despite its thickness. It reminds me of a sourdough starter a little haha It's so unique and I love it! After mixing in the clear toppers (I used about half of each to make my horrifying cat effigy and just to decorate the top) it  becomes delightfully jiggly to play with. The way the toppers and the base mesh together is really nice and mixes up scents into a very lovely sweet cappuccino smell. 

The artwork for this slime is provided by the lovely Cherriuu, who has given us a cute cat cafe maid! I got the common card for this one and love the chibi style. I'm so happy to have one of their pieces of art in my collection!! 

I don't usually do DIY kits because I think they can get expensive and bulky but Catpuccino had a VERY affordable price point at 15.99 USD and I can't complain about that. I was super curious about the texture too and I'm so happy I snagged it-- as a cat and coffee lover! I'm not sure making a terrifying cat face with the toppers was a smart idea because that face is etched into my memory for the rest of time but WORTH IT. 

Thank you again, Phancy for the fantastic birthday package and the sweet message and I can't wait for your November release. I'll review Mysterious Alchemist tomorrow! ",1,1729879223.0,Slime,0,0.66,False

""Setting course due west. If we push the engines, we can be a hundred miles out in fifteen minutes.""

""Do it,"" I say, pushing the throttles forward. The engines roar in response, the vibrations coursing through Thunderchild like a surge of adrenaline.

As we accelerate away from the storm, the sky begins to change. The oppressive gray clouds thin out, revealing streaks of fiery orange and crimson as the sun starts its descent. The turbulence eases, and for a moment, the vast expanse of the ocean below looks almost serene—a deceptive calm after the chaos we've endured.

""Distance from the eye is now eighty miles,"" Kat reports. ""Ninety miles... one hundred miles. Holding position.""

""Maintain altitude at twenty-five thousand feet,"" I instruct. ""Keep us steady.""

Gonzo's voice crackles over the intercom. ""Cap, any idea what's going on? They didn't just send us out here for a sightseeing tour.""

""Your guess is as good as mine,"" I reply. ""But I have a feeling we're about to find out.""

Then, without warning, the radar pings.

""Jax, look at this,"" Kat says, eyebrows knitting together as she studies the screen.

I look down to see a cluster of unidentified signals appearing high above the storm. ""What the hell...?""

Sami steps into the cockpit, her eyes wide behind her glasses. ""I'm picking up some unusual readings—massive energy spikes high above the storm. It's like nothing I've ever seen.""

Before I can respond, the radio springs to life. ""Reaper Corps to Thunderchild, hold your current position. Do not engage any systems that could interfere with electromagnetic fields. Maintain radio silence until further instructed.""

I look out over the vast stretch of ocean, the hurricane's eye still visible on the horizon—a monstrous swirl of dark clouds and flickering lightning. Then, something catches my eye.

""Kat, look at that!"" I point toward the sky above the storm.
She squints, then her eyes widen. ""What in the world...""

High above the hurricane, the atmosphere ignites with brilliant streaks of light. Dozens—no, hundreds—of fiery trails pierce the sky, descending rapidly toward the storm's core. It's like watching the stars themselves plummeting to Earth.

Sami's fingers fly over her tablet. ""I'm detecting objects entering the atmosphere at Mach 20. The energy signatures are off the charts!""

""Mach 20?"" I echo. ""That's hypersonic. Nothing we have moves that fast—nothing conventional, anyway.""

As the descending objects close in on the storm, they begin to glow brighter, the friction igniting them into blazing comets. The sky turns a brilliant white, forcing us to shield our eyes.

Then, the impact.

A series of blinding flashes erupt as the objects slam into the hurricane's eye with unimaginable force. The shockwaves ripple outward, distorting the very air around them. The clouds are torn apart, massive chunks vaporized instantaneously. The ocean below reacts violently, colossal waves surging outward from the point of impact.

""Hold on!"" I shout, gripping the controls as Thunderchild is buffeted by the turbulent air. The plane shakes violently, alarms blaring as we fight to maintain altitude.

""Wind shear is off the scale!"" Kat yells, struggling with her own controls.

Through the cockpit windows, we witness a spectacle that defies belief. Columns of light rise from the storm's core, spiraling upward like luminous tornadoes. The clouds are drawn into the vortex, spiraling upward before dissipating into nothingness.

""The hurricane... it's collapsing!"" Sami exclaims. ""The central pressure is skyrocketing, and wind speeds are dropping fast!""

Lightning arcs across the sky, not the jagged bolts we're used to but vast webs of electricity that dance between the dissipating clouds and the ionosphere above. The air crackles with energy, a symphony of thunder reverberating around us.

""Radiation levels are spiking but stabilizing,"" Sami reports. ""We're within safe limits, but whatever they're doing down there is rewriting the rulebook.""

I glance at the radar screen, which is flickering wildly before settling back to normal. The once-massive storm is unraveling before our eyes, the eye wall disintegrating as the sea below calms, its surface returning to an almost unnatural stillness.

""Did they just... annihilate the hurricane?"" Gonzo asks, disbelief heavy in his tone.

""Looks that way,"" I reply, equally stunned.

A voice crackles over the radio, breaking the trance. ""Thunderchild, this is Reaper Corps. The threat has been neutralized. You are cleared to return to base.""

I grab the radio mic. ""Reaper Corps, this is Thunderchild. What the hell just happened? Over.""

Silence.

""Reaper Command, do you copy? The storm is dissipating. We need to know what actions you've taken. Over.""

The static stretches on, the only response an empty hiss. I grit my teeth, frustration boiling over.

""Dammit, answer me!""

Finally, the voice returns, as composed as ever. ""Thunderchild, we did what had to be done. Your mission is complete. Return to base. Reaper Corps out.""

The line goes dead.

Kat finally breaks the silence. ""Did they seriously just vaporize a hurricane?""

""I guess…"" I mutter. ""But how the hell…""

“I’m looking at the telemetry data…,” Sami mutters. ""Those readings… I don’t know what to say...""

My gut twists. She's right—something about this whole thing feels wrong. There’s no way you throw around that kind of firepower unless you know exactly what you’re dealing with. And they knew. Those hypersonic projectiles didn’t just come out of nowhere.

“Any chance those things could’ve been meteorites?” Gonzo asks.

Sami snorts, a nervous, humorless laugh. “Meteorites? Whatever those were, they entered the atmosphere at Mach 20, changed direction, and hit the storm like precision-guided missiles. Those things were…” She trails off, shaking her head.

""The Rods from God,"" I say, matter-of-fact and grim.

Kat looks up, frowning. ""What the hell are the 'Rods from God'?""

""It’s black project shit,"" I say, my tone dead serious. ""Kinetic bombardment. Imagine dropping telephone poles made of tungsten from orbit. No explosives—just pure kinetic energy. A single impact alone could vaporize bunkers, flatten a city block, hell, even trigger seismic events.""

Kat stares at him, her expression somewhere between disbelief and awe. ""You’re telling me they carpet bombed a storm… from space?""

“Yeah, something like that,” I reply grimly. ""They’ve been a rumor for years—military sci-fi stuff. Supposed to be impossible. No nation officially acknowledges its existence.""

Kat lets out a shaky breath. ""Well, someone developed them. And they just dropped their entire stockpile into that storm.""

The implications hit me like a freight train. If this is true, we’re not just talking about storm response or weather control—we just witnessed the deployment of a first-strike orbital weapon system. One nobody’s supposed to have.

The storm is gone. Obliterated. And the sky feels too quiet. A heavy silence clings to the air like the aftermath of a gunfight—smoke still hanging, the ringing in your ears reminding you you're lucky to be alive. But something about it doesn't feel like a victory. 

I sit back in my seat, the weight of exhaustion settling in, when a new ping pops up on the radar.

""Jax, we’ve got company,"" Kat says, narrowing her eyes.

""For Christ’s sake, what now?"" I ask, already knowing the answer.

Two dots appear on the radar, approaching from the southeast. Fast.
Kat shakes her head. ""Not Coast Guard. Not NOAA. Definitely not commercial.""

I look out the cockpit window, and there they are: two sleek, black F-35s streaking toward us like wolves closing in on a wounded deer. The paint jobs look off—matte black, almost like they’ve been dipped in shadow, with markings I don’t recognize. And their weapons loadouts? Unusual. Not the standard air-to-ground package you’d expect. These birds are armed to the teeth—air-to-air missiles bristling under the wings, along with pods and configurations I’ve never seen before.

""Not exactly the welcome wagon I was expecting…"" Kat mutters, her jaw tight.

The radio crackles to life, and a clipped, professional voice cuts through.

""NOAA 43, this is Echo-Lead. We are under orders to escort you to MacDill Air Force Base. You are to maintain your current heading. Acknowledge.""

There’s a beat of silence, just long enough to feel deliberate. ""Maintain your current heading, Thunderchild,"" the pilot repeats. ""MacDill Tower will brief you upon arrival. Do not deviate from your flight path.""

Kat shoots me a glance. ""Friendly bunch, huh?""

""Yeah. Real comforting,"" I mutter.

The F-35s close in, slipping into formation on either side of us—close enough that I can see the pilots through their tinted canopies. They’re steady, controlled, flying too tight for comfort. This isn’t an escort. It’s a warning.

As we push north, the Gulf slips into view below us, stretching out like glass. That’s when I see it—a dark mass on the horizon, moving steadily eastward.

""Jax,"" Kat asks.""What is that?""

My eyes narrowing. ""That’s... a carrier group.""

Sure enough, an entire U.S. Navy carrier strike group is cutting through the Gulf. At least one Nimitz-class carrier, with destroyers and cruisers flanking it like guards escorting a VIP. Planes are lined up on the deck—Super Hornets, AWACS, even a few drones.

""They must’ve scrambled the whole damn Atlantic fleet,"" Kat mutters.
""Looks like,"" I reply, a knot forming in my gut. ""They knew this storm was coming.""

____

Upon landing at MacDill Air Force Base, we were immediately met by a cadre of stern-faced government agents clad in dark suits. They didn't offer greetings or explanations—just curt instructions as they escorted us away from Thunderchild. Military police cordoned off our aircraft, and we watched as teams of technicians swarmed over it, treating it like a contaminated artifact.

They separated us, each taken to a different stark, windowless room somewhere deep within the base. For the next twenty-four hours—or perhaps longer; time lost meaning—we were subjected to relentless questioning. Rotating shifts of interrogators grilled me about every detail: the storm's anomalies, the creatures we encountered, the mysterious ""Reaper Command,"" and the cataclysmic event that obliterated the hurricane. They wanted to know everything we saw, heard, and felt, pressing for specifics as if our lives depended on it.

After relentless interrogations, they hauled us to a sterile medical facility. Every test imaginable—MRIs, blood draws, neurological scans—was performed with cold precision. They scraped under our nails, scanned for radiation, and asked bizarre questions: “Any strange thoughts? Voices? Memories that don’t feel like yours?”

Experts in lab coats joined the fray, presenting data readouts and grainy footage, asking me to interpret spikes in energy readings or anomalies in the electromagnetic spectrum. They played back our own recordings, pausing and rewinding, searching for any inconsistency in my account. It was clear they already knew a lot more than they were letting on.

Meanwhile, Thunderchild was being picked apart. They combed through every inch of her—downloading flight data, retrieving black box recordings, analyzing the scavenger’s severed limb, even scraping residue from the hull and cabin. Any physical evidence that could validate—or contradict—our experiences was collected and cataloged.

After what felt like an eternity, they abruptly ended the interrogation. No conclusions, no debriefing—just a terse announcement that we were free to go. As I stepped out into the blinding sunlight, blinking away the haze of the windowless room, one of the lead agents caught up to me.

He fixed me with a cold, unwavering stare. ""Captain Jackson,"" he said evenly, ""You did one hell of a job out there. If you ever get tired of chasing storms and want to fly missions that matter on a different level—missions to protect all of humanity—give me a call.""
He held out a small, unmarked card. No insignia, no rank. Just a number.

I glance at the card, turning it over between my fingers. 

I slip the card into my jacket pocket without a word, locking eyes with him. “Appreciate the offer,” I say, keeping my tone neutral.
He smirks, almost like he knows the decision isn’t final yet. “Take care, Captain. And stay ready.”

___

The next few days were pure limbo, like waiting for news about a loved one in surgery. Every hour dragged, each one longer than the last. None of us knew what was happening with Thunderchild—if she was grounded for good, or if they were planning to rip her apart piece by piece, scrapping a lifetime of memories along with her metal skin. 

I tried to distract myself, but there was only so much TV, sleep, and bad coffee to fill the void. I think I must’ve refreshed my inbox a thousand times, waiting for some kind of official word.
And then, three days later, I got the call.

""Captain Jackson?"" the voice on the other end said, cool and businesslike. ""Your aircraft has been cleared for flight. Inspection’s complete, and Thunderchild is ready to return to active duty.""

I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding. For a second, I couldn’t speak—just nodded into the phone like an idiot, holding back tears. Finally, I managed to choke out, ""Thanks for the update.""

My entire crew had made it through.

My hands were still shaking as I fumbled for my phone and opened our crew’s group chat.

Me:

Thunderchild is back. We’re cleared for flight. She made it, guys.
The response was almost immediate.

Sami: 

OMG, really?! This is the best news I’ve heard all week.

Gonzo:

We are so fucking back.

Me:

The Afterburner tonight. First round’s on me.

Kat:

“About damn time."" 

___ 

The Afterburner sits tucked away in a grungy corner near the Tampa International tarmac, a dive bar that smells like jet fuel, fried food, and bad decisions. It’s the kind of place where the walls are plastered with old flight patches and faded pictures of crews who came through over the years. Pilots, ground crews, NOAA staff, and even the occasional Coastie all filter through when they need to blow off steam. Tonight, it was our turn.

We slid into a worn booth near the back, and the waitress—an older lady with a raspy laugh who looked like she’d heard every bad flight story twice—brought over a tray of beers and a bottle of whiskey without asking.

“This one’s on the house,” she said with a wink. “Word travels fast around here. Y’all saved the Florida coast, maybe the whole damn world—least we could do.”

Kat smirks. ""Guess we’re legends now.”

Gonzo leaned back, grinning. “Finally, some recognition.”

""To the Storm Riders,"" Kat said, raising her glass.

""To surviving the unspeakable bullshit,"" Gonzo added, clinking her bottle against mine.

""To the weirdest damn flight of my life,"" Sami muttered with a grin, lifting her beer.

“To Thunderchild,” I said, raising my glass of whiskey.

We drank to that—hell, we drank to everything.

After a couple of rounds, the warmth of the whiskey started to loosen the tightness in my chest. I leaned back, enjoying the rare moment of calm. Kat had her boots kicked up on the bench, nursing her drink with the satisfied look of someone who had just walked through hell and lived to tell about it. Gonzo and Sami, though? They weren’t exactly subtle.

Gonzo was leaning closer, a cocky grin plastered across his face, while Sami twirled a lock of hair around her finger, pretending she wasn’t paying attention—but she totally was.

Kat noticed it too. She gave me a smirk and nudged me under the table with her foot. ""They’re giving each other the look, Jax,” she whispered with a mischievous grin.

I shot her a sideways glance. ""What look?""

She tilted her head toward them. ""The ‘we almost died, let’s not waste any more time’ look.”

She grabbed her drink and slid out of the booth, giving me another nudge with her shoulder. “Come on, Captain. One more round for the road… If you're up for it.”

With a grin, I followed Kat across the bar to a quieter booth tucked in the corner.

Kat dropped into the booth with a sigh and stretched her legs across the seat, her boots kicking against my thigh. 

I flagged down the waitress, and soon enough, two more glasses of whiskey clinked down in front of us. Kat held hers up, giving me a mock-serious look. ""To questionable decisions and barely making it through interdimensional bullshit.""

I chuckled. ""To never doing that again… If we can avoid it.""

We clinked our glasses and drank. The whiskey burned on the way down, but it was the good kind of burn—one that reminded me I was still alive. 

Kat leaned back, her sharp grin softening as she stared at her glass, swirling the amber liquid.

“So…” she said softly, her voice just above the hum of the bar. “You think that storm’s really gone for good?”

I rolled the glass between my hands, considering the question. The silence stretched between us like a tether, heavy and deliberate.

“No,” I finally admitted. “I don’t. At least not for good.”

Her blue eyes narrowed slightly, not in disbelief but in recognition. Like she’d been waiting for that answer.

“That storm… it wasn’t just weather. Hell, a normal hurricane can wipe out entire cities—turn highways into rivers, flatten buildings, rip the earth apart. What we saw in there?” I shook my head. “That wasn’t just a hurricane. It was alive. It had a will. Something that big, that powerful… you don’t just kill it. Not with bombs. Not with nukes. Not even with kinetic rods from space.”

Kat huffed, her breath puffing against the rim of her glass. ""So, what do you think happened? Why did it just stop?”

""You ever eat something you know damn well is gonna come back to haunt you, but you do it anyway?"" I asked, leaning back against the worn leather of the booth.

Kat raised an eyebrow, half-smiling. “Spicy wings from that dive joint near Ybor. Every time. Burns worse going out than it does going in.”

I chuckled. “Yeah, that’s about right. Me? It's chili dogs. Extra jalapeños. Always sounds like a good idea at the time, but two hours later, I’m hunched over, regretting every bite.”

Kat gave me a look, somewhere between a grin and a grimace. “So, what—you think that storm’s the same? Like we just gave it the cosmic equivalent of heartburn?”

""Exactly."" I took a slow sip of whiskey, the warmth spreading down my throat. ""We didn’t kill it. Just gave it enough indigestion to make it think twice before taking another bite out of our reality.""

""So what happens when it gets hungry again?"" Kat asks, tipping her glass toward me. 

Before I could answer, a murmur spread across the bar. Heads turned toward the flickering flat-screen mounted above the bar.

""BREAKING NEWS,"" the banner reads in bold red letters. My stomach tightens.

The bartender turns up the volume, and the overly-calm voice of the anchor breaks through. “This just in—we are receiving reports of a rapidly forming tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico. Meteorologists are closely monitoring the system…”

I exchange a look with Kat, the whiskey in my glass suddenly losing its warmth. 

“Here we go again…” I sigh.",1,1729879093.0,PageTurner627Horror,1,1.0,False

meds: Adderall 20xr in the morning, 10ir in the afternoon. started last December, skip the booster sometimes.

bad habits: 10-15 3mg zyn per day (awful, stupid, I know), 150-200mg caffeine per day (mainly tea now, was mainly coffee)

so both of those habits started off reasonable and escalated dramatically as the year went on, as they are known to do. my plan right now is to slowly decrease usage of both of those and eventually taper off, but if anyone has advice on quitting caffeine or nicotine while on Adderall it'd be appreciated. my main concern (aside from my heart health) is my medicine not being effective due to removing the two additional stimulants I've gotten used to. 

I tried to cold turkey the zyn this week and felt like my brain was being microwaved, and like yeah I could stick it out, but I just accomplished something really difficult and I don't wanna reward myself by torturing myself ya know? excuses excuses

more pressingly, how damaging are these habits? not looking for medical opinions, but like, I run 3 times a week, 65bpm rhr, blood pressure is decent, so say I didn't quit either of them and just kept this routine, am I destroying myself or is it not THAT big of a deal?",1,1729879066.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

Advice needed please from someone on the outside .have been dating a man almost 2 years .i had been single for 6 yrs and him 10 since our previous relationships .yes plenty of fun but neither of us got into a serious relationship with anyone .
My past relationship was highly abusive so i done a lot of work on myself to get to where i was when i met my current partner .his partner cheated on him and left with his 2 kids so a lot self work he would have so had to do on himself .
Everything going great and 11 months into us toghether he goes in a low mood anxiety etc and says he needs time to himself and that he will pull himself out if it .which he did after a week which is fine cos we don’t live near and it’s only weekends we see each other .
Didn’t question to much that first time cos i was so worried about him his mental health .went on holidays a week later and had lovely time .
We chatted most days whilst in work via text and if either of us where feeling down or anxious we would always say 
Fast forward 7 months into this year he goes on holiday with his teenage daughter and comes home in another anxious state meaning I don’t get to see him for another week .when I ask what is wrong or is he feeling he says he felt empty inside .just went to work came home and locked himself away .this continued for 3 weeks .he would text me one day and then nothing the next .i met him for coffee and chatted then just let him go his way until he felt himself again .
After the 3 week spell we got back to normal .everything  great .or so I thought .near end of September we said we where going to book a few days away as I was off this week and he booked it off .just a city break in Europe .last Monday in September I left his house after spending the weekend with him and I haven’t seen him since .He said same thing again bout feeling empty and hates himself .he went to his doctor who has put him on anti depressants.
I went to his home last Sunday and took all my things .i had keys so i was able to let myself in .before  I left I messaged him to ask would it be long till he returned but he said he wasn’t strong enuf to face me and he hates himself .he told me to get home safe .when i did drive home he messaged to ask if i did get home to which I replied i did .
Next morning i get a message .i love you .so in the past 3 weeks he not once said in a message i love you or i still love you or i don’t want to lose you .but when he realises i have taken all my things from his home he then decides to tell me he loves me .
Needless to say my heart is shattered but part of me is convinced this behaviour  is deliberate like a form of control .He is a gentleman whom has never made me feel anything but secure and confident and loved .But then it’s like a light switch .
How can this be normal or more so how can he think this is normal acceptable behaviour towards the woman he declares to love so much .

I’m a 36-year-old woman from Central Europe on the lookout for a partner to share life’s ups, downs, and everything in between. While friendship is great, my goal here is to find someone I genuinely click with and who’s open to building something lasting. If it turns out we don’t quite match, I’m cool with friendship too—just wanted to set the stage.

A little about me: I’m 185 cm (6’1”) tall, curvy, and armed with a sharp sense of humor that keeps people guessing. My mother tongue is German, and I have a penchant for audiobooks, particularly crime thrillers. Yes, I’m the one piecing together clues in my head and probably getting it wrong half the time! When I’m not solving imaginary mysteries, I’m out hiking with my dog, planning my next adventure, or unwinding with some knitting and a cup of coffee (or tea, depending on my mood).

I have a serious love for travel, especially to the northern regions. My idea of a perfect getaway involves exploring vibrant cities, inhaling that fresh sea air, and uncovering hidden gems—not lounging on a beach for ten days. That said, I also cherish a cozy night in just as much as a grand adventure.

A few practical details: I’ve never been married, I don’t have kids, and I’m not looking to change that. When it comes to attraction, I value intelligence and great conversation over physical appearance. I expect more than just a simple “hi” in your first message; I’d appreciate it if you shared a bit about yourself instead. If you can keep up a lively dialogue and enjoy connecting on various topics, we might just hit it off.

So, if this sounds interesting and you’re ready for some genuine conversation (and perhaps a few laughs), shoot me a message and let’s see where it takes us!

# The Importance of Filtration in Our Daily Lives

Filtration plays an essential role in our everyday lives, protecting us from contaminants and ensuring our devices operate effectively. While we often take filters for granted, imagine what would happen if any one of these filters failed. Here are just a few examples of filters we rely on daily:

* **Your Car:** Gas-powered vehicles use filters for air, gas, oil, and transmission fluid to keep the engine running smoothly.
* **Your Vacuum Cleaner:** It has a filter to trap dust and prevent it from circulating back into your home.
* **Your Tap Water:** Many homes have screens or advanced filtration systems to purify drinking water.
* **Household Appliances:** From the lint filter in your clothes dryer to the dust filter in your hair dryer, filters keep these machines safe and efficient.
* **Food and Drink:** Coffee makers, tea bags, and refrigerator water dispensers all use filters to remove unwanted particles.

Despite using all these filters daily, many homeowners overlook a critical one: the air filter in their HVAC system. Ignoring this small yet essential component can lead to increased energy bills, costly repairs, and even health problems. Just as you wouldn’t drink coffee brewed without a filter, make sure your HVAC system’s air filter is keeping your home’s air clean and contributing to better home air quality.

# Would You Want to Breathe This?

Many are shocked to learn that the air inside homes can be more polluted than outdoor air. Everyday household activities and building materials contribute to indoor air pollution, negatively impacting indoor air quality. A clean air filter can trap many of these pollutants, and whole-home air purification systems can further enhance indoor air quality.

Here’s a short list of common pollutants found in homes:

* **Smoke:** From cooking, candles, or fireplaces.
* **Dust:** General household dust.
* **Pet Dander:** From cats, dogs, and other animals.
* **Mold Spores:** Often from moisture-rich areas like bathrooms.
* **Pollen:** Carried inside on clothes, shoes, or pets.
* **Household Cleaners:** Chemicals used in cleaning supplies.
* **Personal Products:** Chemicals from air fresheners, hairsprays, and perfumes.
* **Building Materials:** Older homes may contain lead, asbestos, or formaldehyde, which are known carcinogens.
* **Outdoor Chemicals:** Pesticides and landscaping products tracked inside on shoes.
* **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs):** Found in paints, carpets, and upholstery.

[Dirty vs Clean AC Air Filter](https://preview.redd.it/birakyvtxxwd1.png?width=1373&format=png&auto=webp&s=836ce417add7ef83110a25d5fb8b8b5ffa2550b4)

Breathing dirty air can lead to asthma, allergies, and other respiratory problems. While pollutants like smoke or dust are often visible, many harmful particles are too small to see but can still impact our health. Investing in high-quality AC air filters is crucial for ensuring clean indoor air.

# Polluted Air Harms People and Machines

Poor indoor air quality doesn’t just impact people; it also affects the performance and lifespan of HVAC systems. According to the [U.S. Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/maintaining-your-air-conditioner), an ill-fitting or clogged air filter can increase energy costs by 15%. During peak usage, filter issues can raise energy bills by as much as 70%, as highlighted in a study by [Old Dominion University](https://www.ijme.us/issues/spring2004/Design_Analysis_AirFilter-21stEng.htm). Dirty filters strain HVAC systems, causing parts to overheat or freeze up, which can lead to total system failure or even house fires during winter.

The impact of a failed coffee filter is easy to notice, but the effects of a clogged HVAC air filter are often hidden, leading to costly issues down the line. That’s why changing your home’s air filter every month should be a priority, not an afterthought—it protects your family’s health and enhances your home air purification efforts.

If I eat out or eat any kind of fast food or processed food (and sometimes certain coffees), I’m in the bathroom. I literally have certain “spots” all over campus where I know there is a single bathroom I can be alone in and not worry about feeling embarrassed or judged. I was recently hospitalized for the pain, so they gave me bentyl and Zofran to take as needed. It feels like it doesn’t even help. When I am feeling anxiety at school it makes me have to run to the bathroom several times a day, regardless of what I eat. Today I was in class for only 20 minutes, then had to leave for 20 minutes to go to the bathroom. When I came back to class, I hadn’t even sat down for 2 minutes before I had to leave class again. It’s so embarrassing, and I feel like people probably think I’m weird. But obviously sitting in the class squirming in my chair is more embarrassing than having to leave constantly. I feel like I’m burdening my parents and bf with my issues, and I feel guilty. It feels like I’m alone in this issue, and I feel ashamed that I can’t seem to get this under control.

1gc072y,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1gc072y/dairy_intolerance_some_questions/,Dairy intolerance? Some questions,"My baby is 12 weeks today! While breastfeeding has actually been going pretty smoothly, she still struggles severely with passing gas and pooping. I do think it’s partly dyschezia and she just hasn’t figured out how to poop and pass gas comfortably. However, this month I tried to cut out dairy in desperation despite the pediatrician insisting that her poops looked normal (very runny and mucousy but no blood). We actually had a brief few days where things felt like they were better! She would still be fussy before pooping but once she got it out she was happy and comfortable. The poop was also different - pastier and seedier instead of always runny and full of mucus.  I accidentally had a coffee with milk about 6 days ago and we’re back on the struggle bus. 

Let our doctors know and the pediatric GI specialist just said it’s likely “a trigger” and wants me to cut out soy and dairy. They still don’t feel the need to test anything. I’m pretty frustrated that we’re not getting a whole lot from the medical team. I’m sure they consider me an anxious mom and are dismissive because she’s gaining weight and happens to not be fussy during the total of 1hr  the doctor has ever spent with her. 

Anyway, I guess my question is if any of you have experience with this:
-  can dairy be “a trigger” without officially being CPMA? 
- how do I reintroduce dairy in the future to test? Do I try monthly? Once we hit solids? 
- any other suggestions for an EBF mom struggling with gas? 

Any and all tips welcome. We are also using gas drops which help and just introduced a probiotic. I am just so defeated at this point - I was really waiting for this 12 week mark when everyone said things would get better and it’s still the same all day long discomfort and colic episodes at night.

I have the Quest 3, and I think there's something I'm not getting about the boundary system.

Early in the initialization process, I set up my space, with furniture, walls, etc. I liked it because I could set up a coffee table, which wouldn't be flagged as out of bounds when swinging over it.

But every time I launch a ""full screen"" app, like Steam Link, it asks me to set up my boundary, which only allows for tracing on the ground without being able to define furniture like above.

Is there a way to make sure that apps use the ""saved space"" and not a drawn boundary?

","Hello everyone, I am a 36-year-old woman living in this fast-paced city. Although work and family take up most of my time, I always believe that one's life should not only be busy and responsible, but also happy and sharing. Therefore, I am here to sincerely hope that I can make friends with like-minded people.



🔖 About me



I am a working woman who has been working for many years and loves my career but knows that there is more to life than just work. I love traveling, especially to places with history and culture, and exploring new customs is one of my greatest pleasures. In addition, I love to read, and books are another window into the world. Whether it is a novel, an essay, or a psychology book, I can immerse myself in them and enjoy the catharsis of my mind.



In life, I am a person who likes to try new things, and I have recently gotten hooked on baking and yoga, enjoying the feeling of finding balance in flour and sweat. On weekends, I like to go to various markets, find fresh ingredients, cook a nice dinner and share laughter and good food with friends.



🔖 I'm looking for



I'm looking to make some fun friends, whether it's a like-minded partner or a good girlfriend to share life with. I hope you also have a passion for life and would like to discuss various topics together, from career development to life chores, from movies and music to travel experiences.



I'm very open to friends of all ages, so if you're also looking to increase your social circle or seeking some warm companionship, please don't hesitate to drop me a line. We can meet for coffee, go to the movies, or even sign up for a class together to encourage each other and move forward hand in hand.



🔖 Final Words



Life is not easy, but having friends by our side can make everything better. I look forward to meeting you, let's go make more great memories together!

1gbzvwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1gbzvwj/i_am_a_fking_mess/,I am a F*king Mess,"(THIS IS LONG)

I was an alternative kid in my teens and 20s, I had dyed hair, wore makeup and had and was a bit of a misfit. But I was me, unapologetically, I had an identity, a sense of self and an exciting and unknown future in front of me. I was going to change the world.

Fast forward to my early 30s and I just feel deflated. Over time, all my friends branched off and disappeared into their own lives. The few who I still do speak to have gone completely corporate and lead dull lives, all they ever talk about is money, position, and plans for the future, never the moment. I still haven’t really progressed anywhere in my life, I haven’t achieved anything of note, I don’t have any dreams any more. I am numb, lost and without any sense of purpose or meaning. All the optimism that I once had for the future has completely disappeared and it feels like the world has defeated me and I am just floating.

I have a pattern of getting these sudden bursts of energy and motivation and i feel like my old self in my 20s where i can take on the world and i have all these goals i want to accomplish. But then something in me just snaps, and i go back to being severely lazy and depressed and not wanting to do anything. Just sitting and eating and smoking and daydreaming. Those are the only things that bring me joy.

I have never understood how people can work full time or at all and just function and push through day by day. I understand that they do it because they have responsibilities. But i have responsibilities too. I know what it’s like to have nothing, and that still isn’t enough. How do people do that?? like are you all fucking robots?? Did i miss some type of programming or battery pack that was supposed to be installed in me when i turned 18?? it’s just so miserable for me.

I don’t want to do anything. i don’t want to get better. I don’t want a job. I don’t want to be successful. I don’t want to exist on this earth. I want to just be in bed. But I know I should be doing these things, but I just don’t see the point. I think subconsciously I know I am wasting my life away because every night before bed I have trouble sleeping and severe anxiety attacks and fear of death and not being able to do anything again. It's such an oxymoron.

I wake up and I am exhausted, tired of the world before even beginning. I daydream so much. like an unhealthy amount. I've realised that i've been doing it all my life, and it’s to escape the loneliness that i’ve always felt and the misery and disappointment I feel towards the world. It is such a grey, cruel place that does not care and the majority of people are like drones with no distinguishing characteristics - selfish self centered creatures who are all on a mission to lie, cheat and fuck each other over in order to get slightly ahead.

It’s so pathetic because some of these people that i daydream about are people I barely know, or haven't spoken to in years, or relationships from years ago, or decades where I wasn't even alive. I’ve created this safe space in my head, envisioning different scenarios where they’re my friends or my partner and everything is adventurous and exciting and loving and they like me and life is perfect. In reality however, most every one of these friendships or relationships that i daydream about, i’ve burned to the ground and of course, in the real world, these people are enjoying their lives and are not thinking about me at all. They probably wouldn’t even remember who i was if they saw me today. Yet here i am, thousands of miles away in my little apartment, blasting music and pacing back and forth, talking to them as if they were actually here with me.

It is so embarrassing, and I’m cringing writing this. I’m not doing anything in my life. I’m just in my head all the time. I’ve been living in these fantasies. All these fake story lines that I have created with these people. But i can’t help it, it makes me feel good. It helps me escape into this world where I'm not such a misfit with a miserable existence and resentment towards a life that held the promise of so much yet delivered nothing.

My alarm goes off at 7:30 every morning, but I always turn it off and end up getting out of bed much later. Whenever I do get out of bed, I just feel exhausted and poorly rested. I drag myself downstairs where I will drink a coffee and smoke and either daydream or watch some mindless crap on youtube (my laptop virtually never leaves my side). I will then scroll political sites and forums to get updates on all of the doom and gloom of the political world, I know it is bad for my mental health but I am addicted to it. I guess I’m just hoping to read about a miracle that has happened that will make things better. I will then call up any member of the family who will answer because it is an excuse to talk, pass time, drink coffee and smoke more. Then it will be more couch sitting, doom scrolling, looking at old photos of happier times (which just makes me more miserable because those days aren’t coming back), watching youtube. I’ve also noticed that I endlessly browse eBay and other buying sites for things that I can’t afford because the idea of having these things feeds into my daydreaming. Like I know I don’t have it, won’t have it, and can’t afford it, but imagine if I did, the adventures I would have, or what I would do.

I’ve realised that i have no identity. no sense of self. i don’t think i know who i am. when I’m around different people, it’s like I shape into who I think i’m supposed to be at that moment. I don’t know what I like, or what I really want. I just put on different masks in front of different faces. I feel like an actor all the time, putting on a performance all the time. I have spent so much time fantasizing in my head *(which is so much better than the real world)* that I have lost who i am. Ok, there are times when i feel like i am being myself with certain people, so I can’t say it's all the time, but before long, I'm back to pretending. back to feeling like I'm just here, existing, and no one understands me. it’s all really confusing and I am massively disassociated.

The only things i can say I’ve found genuine interest in and have enjoyed in life are mechanics, designing and acting. As much as I hate it, I lost interest in mechanics years ago projects lie in the garage unfinished and i have no motivation to pick them up again. Designing became part of a self-employment attempt and when it didn't work out, it became a chore. - and with acting, I wouldn’t want to do it again, I already am in real life.

Another pathetic point. My partner pays my rent. All my life my family have swooped in and saved me and now my partner does it too, which has always further enabled my laziness because i know, no matter how many times i fall, one of them will pick me up again and again. So financially, everything is taken care of everything for me. my lazy ass just piggybacks off them because i don’t wanna do anything in life like the pathetic person i am.

One flicker of hope came recently when I found a classic beetle that was up for sale which sparked me up again. Sure, it would mean I'd need to get a loan, and sell my existing car. Sure it would be constant work to keep it running. Hell, I might need to get a part time job to fund it. But I thought, could it be the break out of this chain by kicking me up the ass and giving me a goal? a purpose? something to work and live for? - Or is it just more daydreaming and a desperate attempt at escapism through materialism?

I’m so fucked up and have been realizing my habits and how bad they are. it’s so overwhelming, and i don’t know what to do or where to begin, everything is inter-connected and related to something else. The only thing i know to do, the only thing that i want to do and that’s familiar to me and brings me comfort, is to keep doing what I’m doing. but it’s also harming me. it’s making me dig myself deeper into this hole. this miserable, soul-sucking, agonizing hole.

1gbzvby,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1gbzvby/i_am_a_fking_mess/,I am a F*king mess,"(THIS IS LONG)

I was an alternative kid in my teens and 20s, I had dyed hair, wore makeup and had and was a bit of a misfit. But I was me, unapologetically, I had an identity, a sense of self and an exciting and unknown future in front of me. I was going to change the world.

Fast forward to my early 30s and I just feel deflated. Over time, all my friends branched off and disappeared into their own lives. The few who I still do speak to have gone completely corporate and lead dull lives, all they ever talk about is money, position, and plans for the future, never the moment. I still haven’t really progressed anywhere in my life, I haven’t achieved anything of note, I don’t have any dreams any more. I am numb, lost and without any sense of purpose or meaning. All the optimism that I once had for the future has completely disappeared and it feels like the world has defeated me and I am just floating.

I have a pattern of getting these sudden bursts of energy and motivation and i feel like my old self in my 20s where i can take on the world and i have all these goals i want to accomplish. But then something in me just snaps, and i go back to being severely lazy and depressed and not wanting to do anything. Just sitting and eating and smoking and daydreaming. Those are the only things that bring me joy.

I have never understood how people can work full time or at all and just function and push through day by day. I understand that they do it because they have responsibilities. But i have responsibilities too. I know what it’s like to have nothing, and that still isn’t enough. How do people do that?? like are you all fucking robots?? Did i miss some type of programming or battery pack that was supposed to be installed in me when i turned 18?? it’s just so miserable for me.

I don’t want to do anything. i don’t want to get better. I don’t want a job. I don’t want to be successful. I don’t want to exist on this earth. I want to just be in bed. But I know I should be doing these things, but I just don’t see the point. I think subconsciously I know I am wasting my life away because every night before bed I have trouble sleeping and severe anxiety attacks and fear of death and not being able to do anything again. It's such an oxymoron.

I wake up and I am exhausted, tired of the world before even beginning. I daydream so much. like an unhealthy amount. I've realised that i've been doing it all my life, and it’s to escape the loneliness that i’ve always felt and the misery and disappointment I feel towards the world. It is such a grey, cruel place that does not care and the majority of people are like drones with no distinguishing characteristics - selfish self centered creatures who are all on a mission to lie, cheat and fuck each other over in order to get slightly ahead.

It’s so pathetic because some of these people that i daydream about are people I barely know, or haven't spoken to in years, or relationships from years ago, or decades where I wasn't even alive. I’ve created this safe space in my head, envisioning different scenarios where they’re my friends or my partner and everything is adventurous and exciting and loving and they like me and life is perfect. In reality however, most every one of these friendships or relationships that i daydream about, i’ve burned to the ground and of course, in the real world, these people are enjoying their lives and are not thinking about me at all. They probably wouldn’t even remember who i was if they saw me today. Yet here i am, thousands of miles away in my little apartment, blasting music and pacing back and forth, talking to them as if they were actually here with me.

It is so embarrassing, and I’m cringing writing this. I’m not doing anything in my life. I’m just in my head all the time. I’ve been living in these fantasies. All these fake story lines that I have created with these people. But i can’t help it, it makes me feel good. It helps me escape into this world where I'm not such a misfit with a miserable existence and resentment towards a life that held the promise of so much yet delivered nothing.

My alarm goes off at 7:30 every morning, but I always turn it off and end up getting out of bed much later. Whenever I do get out of bed, I just feel exhausted and poorly rested. I drag myself downstairs where I will drink a coffee and smoke and either daydream or watch some mindless crap on youtube (my laptop virtually never leaves my side). I will then scroll political sites and forums to get updates on all of the doom and gloom of the political world, I know it is bad for my mental health but I am addicted to it. I guess I’m just hoping to read about a miracle that has happened that will make things better. I will then call up any member of the family who will answer because it is an excuse to talk, pass time, drink coffee and smoke more. Then it will be more couch sitting, doom scrolling, looking at old photos of happier times (which just makes me more miserable because those days aren’t coming back), watching youtube. I’ve also noticed that I endlessly browse eBay and other buying sites for things that I can’t afford because the idea of having these things feeds into my daydreaming. Like I know I don’t have it, won’t have it, and can’t afford it, but imagine if I did, the adventures I would have, or what I would do.

I’ve realised that i have no identity. no sense of self. i don’t think i know who i am. when I’m around different people, it’s like I shape into who I think i’m supposed to be at that moment. I don’t know what I like, or what I really want. I just put on different masks in front of different faces. I feel like an actor all the time, putting on a performance all the time. I have spent so much time fantasizing in my head *(which is so much better than the real world)* that I have lost who i am. Ok, there are times when i feel like i am being myself with certain people, so I can’t say it's all the time, but before long, I'm back to pretending. back to feeling like I'm just here, existing, and no one understands me. it’s all really confusing and I am massively disassociated.

The only things i can say I’ve found genuine interest in and have enjoyed in life are mechanics, designing and acting. As much as I hate it, I lost interest in mechanics years ago projects lie in the garage unfinished and i have no motivation to pick them up again. Designing became part of a self-employment attempt and when it didn't work out, it became a chore. - and with acting, I wouldn’t want to do it again, I already am in real life.

Another pathetic point. My partner pays my rent. All my life my family have swooped in and saved me and now my partner does it too, which has always further enabled my laziness because i know, no matter how many times i fall, one of them will pick me up again and again. So financially, everything is taken care of everything for me. my lazy ass just piggybacks off them because i don’t wanna do anything in life like the pathetic person i am.

One flicker of hope came recently when I found a classic beetle that was up for sale which sparked me up again. Sure, it would mean I'd need to get a loan, and sell my existing car. Sure it would be constant work to keep it running. Hell, I might need to get a part time job to fund it. But I thought, could it be the break out of this chain by kicking me up the ass and giving me a goal? a purpose? something to work and live for? - Or is it just more daydreaming and a desperate attempt at escapism through materialism?

I’m so fucked up and have been realizing my habits and how bad they are. it’s so overwhelming, and i don’t know what to do or where to begin, everything is inter-connected and related to something else. The only thing i know to do, the only thing that i want to do and that’s familiar to me and brings me comfort, is to keep doing what I’m doing. but it’s also harming me. it’s making me dig myself deeper into this hole. this miserable, soul-sucking, agonizing hole.

May kalandian ako matagal na rin more than one year. Drama lang yan kalandian pero ganoon na rin yon jowa na HAHAHA. Nung una okay naman (syempre teh papalakas) tipong masasabi mong iba talaga sa mga nauna kong kalandian. Lagi niya sinasabi sa akin na kapag may problema pag-usapan and kapag napag-usapan na or may na raise na concern sa kanya di na niya uulitin. So, ako naman nag try rin, na kapag may sinabi na di nagustuhan sa ginawa ko, lagi akong nagdadalawang isip bago gawin yung isang bagay or papaalam ko muna kasi baka mamaya iba na pala dating sa kanya.

Tapos kahapon na magkasama kami, kahapon ko lang din nalaman na aalis siya at inuna pa niya talaga paalam sa friends (blockmates din) niya na pupunta siya ha kaysa sa akin. Bago yan, napag-usapan naman na namin na go kitain mo friends mo kasi ngayon na lang ulit. Also dalawa kasi event niya kahapon, una with hs friends (which is ako pa nagsabi na mag chat siya kung tuloy para makapagkita sila —— tuloy raw, so go, mag stay na lang ako sa coffee shop kasi may need ako tapusin at ayaw ko rin sumama kasi nga awkward naman minsan na lang sila magkita tapos may jowa pang kasama). Yung isa inuman, na di na siya nag update (days before) kung matutuloy kasi nga bumabagyo, aba biglang sabi na hahatid ako maaga kasi iinom daw. P*ny*eta ka pala eh, tamang yaya ka pa na ngayon umalis para mahaba time tapos iuuwi mo rin pala ako?? Hays hirap talaga kapag 8080 huhu ayaw ko pa naman sa bonak ta*na di ginagamit utak. 

Sa tinagal-tagal naming naglalandian teh lagi na lang ako yung huling taong nakakaalam sa desisyon niya (daming beses na nagyari ngayong taon). Tipong last minute talaga. Di ko naman siya pinagbabawalan kasi nga kung magloloko, magloloko talaga. Ilang beses na rin nangyari naisip ko lang kung gusto ba niya talaga ng jowa or masabi lang na mayroon. 

At dahil fully developed na ang frontal lobe ko. Iniwan ko na siya at kinuha lahat ng gamit sa kotse. You reap what you sow, hun 💅.

Balik ka na lang sa pakipapagmomol mo kung kani-kanino. Ewww. 

P.S. Di kami nagkakilala sa bar and hindi rin ako nakikipagmomol kung kani-kanino. Kadire! Late ko rin nalaman yan. Tanga pa nung time na yan.

The relationship was a completely dramatic and an emotional rollercoaster. I’m so happy I ended it but recently I have an urge to contact him, and it worries me. Finally I managed to get rid of him - he constantly texted me really long, emotionally manipulative messages on telegram, even though I begged him to stop. So I blocked him there. He proceeded to text me on Whatsapp, those kind of messages that really messes with your mind when you receive them in the middle of your work day and want to cry. After I blocked him on whatsapp he sent me SMS. I blocked his number. After a while, I downloaded bumble and he commented on my profile ‚good luck, let’s talk if you’re ready‘.
Now it’s been a while that I didn’t hear from him, so I unblocked him because I don’t want to feel like I must block someone who I loved so much. I’m in a great relationship with my other ex, we are even friends and meet regularly for coffee or lunch, but obviously he is emotionally much more mature and so am I. But having him unblocked confuses me, and after a month and a half of not being intimate with anyone I think about how hot our sex was and about the good times and I’m blinded.
I catch myself weirdly bored, like I have an itch to call him and have some of his drama again. Which doesn’t make sense, this is exactly what I ran away from. It was absolutely crazy. And I wanted my life back. But I feel so numb without him. As if I have gotten used to this extreme level of stress and heightened emotional state. 
When does this urge to contact them stop? My body still longs for him, even after everything and all the pain. I know that it’s impossible to just have a phone call with him or meet for a coffee despite it being half a year since we broke up. And I cannot deal with this heavy emotional stream of messages once again. I feel so strong for breaking up with him despite being so in love with him at the time. He literally took my breath away every time he entered the room even after 1.5 years together. My heart missed a beat and I was at awe of his strong presence and of his beauty (in my opinion). I was so devoted and wanted to give my all to him, and I’m so confused as to why did I feel like that; so much love, admiration and devotion to someone who constantly made earth shake under my feet and messed around with my emotions. And certainly didn’t respect me enough to let me go when I finally ended this madhouse… and now I have an urge to contact him?

Beginner here... I am looking to get started with a machine (milk steamer built in) plus a separate electric grinder (I am a big big pour over guy so would like that func. separate)... And have a budget around 600 USD... Willing to go up to about 700 IF the situation fits.

A few things about me that may be helpful context :) & Thank you all!!!

|Location| - Seattle/Whidbey Island, WA| 

|Preferred drink types| - Lattes, with the occasional shot of espresso after dinner | |Drink frequency|Probably would only make about 1 latte a day for myself, BUT we entertain often and would like the ability to pull more than one shot in quick(ish) succession. I love the act of making coffee though, so this isnt too big of a need for me convenience-wise | 

|Space| - Nothing that I can think of... However, I would really like the grinder and the machine to look somewhat cohesive. When you walk into our home you walk RIGHT into the kitchen, so would love to have it not look like totally random appliances on the counter.| 

|Experience level|- Very much a beginner in the espresso field. However, I ship my beans from my favorite roaster(s) so I know my way around bean roast and flavors and would LOVE if I had a machine that highlights these aspects instead of masking them. | 

|Manual or electric| - Electric would be great. I think as a beginner, I would like it to be approachable, but being naturally curious about coffee and brewing, I wouldn't hate the idea of some complexities that I could tinker around with!| 

|Candidates| - I really don't have any ""candidates"" i can think of. Most models I look at have price tags that are just so so high. Would love to get a little ""off-the-grid"" with you all to see if you have some creative and expert solutions.|",2,1729876850.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

I’m a 36-year-old woman from Central Europe on the lookout for a partner to share life’s ups, downs, and everything in between. While friendship is great, my goal here is to find someone I genuinely click with and who’s open to building something lasting. If it turns out we don’t quite match, I’m cool with friendship too—just wanted to set the stage.

A little about me: I’m 185 cm (6’1”) tall, curvy, and armed with a sharp sense of humor that keeps people guessing. My mother tongue is German, and I have a penchant for audiobooks, particularly crime thrillers. Yes, I’m the one piecing together clues in my head and probably getting it wrong half the time! When I’m not solving imaginary mysteries, I’m out hiking with my dog, planning my next adventure, or unwinding with some knitting and a cup of coffee (or tea, depending on my mood).

I have a serious love for travel, especially to the northern regions. My idea of a perfect getaway involves exploring vibrant cities, inhaling that fresh sea air, and uncovering hidden gems—not lounging on a beach for ten days. That said, I also cherish a cozy night in just as much as a grand adventure.

A few practical details: I’ve never been married, I don’t have kids, and I’m not looking to change that. When it comes to attraction, I value intelligence and great conversation over physical appearance. I expect more than just a simple “hi” in your first message; I’d appreciate it if you shared a bit about yourself instead. If you can keep up a lively dialogue and enjoy connecting on various topics, we might just hit it off.

So, if this sounds interesting and you’re ready for some genuine conversation (and perhaps a few laughs), shoot me a message and let’s see where it takes us!

The gist of my question is: **seemingly regardless of how much I use my WDT tool, how heavily or lightly I tamp, how hot the water is or how finely I grind, every shot I pull splatters all over the place.** The taste generally isn't bad, but it is messy and ugly to look at and I feel like could be an indicator of a larger problem with my process and an opportunity to make better coffee.

  
The only time I have been able to pull clean shots is when I started hitting the brew button the very second the light comes on. For whatever reason, that would routinely pull a pretty tasty 40g of liquid espresso from 20g of ground coffee in about 30 seconds even though I am well aware there is no way the water is actually getting hot enough in that short a period of time. Is it compensating with increased water pressure?

I now have a PID tool so I wait 30 minutes for the water to heat up to 115 degrees Celsius before pulling. But now the taste is more inconsistent and the splattering gets pretty crazy. As I said, I have tried grinding finer, using 18g instead of 20g of ground coffee, tamping much more lightly, distributing anywhere between 4-12 loops around the portafilter with my WDT.

I've been budgeting and re-budgeting, but the reality is that some dreams are too expensive.  
So, my dilemma is this: I'd love to have a buffet breakfast for the wedding, but the food alone will cost about R9000, not including the wedding cake or drinks. This feels impossible.

I'm considering a pizza buffet instead. I mean, everyone loves pizza, hot or cold, guests could take leftovers, and the cleanup would be easier. If I buy a pizza for each guest, it’ll only cost around R3500, which fits much better with my budget. My question is, would this be seen as cheap? It won't be a fancy wedding; minimal decor and no unnecessary extras that every bride wants but don't really need. My hope was to focus on the food since it’s what people tend to remember most about weddings.  
This is what the menu would look like if I went with the breakfast buffet: flapjacks, mini croissants, freshly baked bread, eggs, cheese grillers, boerewors, bacon, cheese, yogurt, fruit, juice, coffee, cappachino, and cheesecake as the wedding cake and obviously champagne for the toasts. This sounds delightful.  
This is the menu with the pizza: pizza, cheesecake as the wedding cake and champagne for the toasts. Our wedding favours are those cute ""her favourite, his favourite"" sweets packets. We will have welcoming shots/drinks that's like a honey mead.  
So I ask you, oh readers of Reddit, will this work? Or should I just not give a damn about what the guests will think because they're getting free food anyway? Because me and my soon-to-be husband can still have a breakfast buffet with pictures on the honeymoon, so I can still get my wish, just on a smaller scale.

This is huge! 
They basically are explaining how he decorates his home for Christmas, that’s probably why he was doing it so soon lately, we could see a few details in his videos. 
The price of the paperback magazine was around $15, but I got it for $4 tax included because I had some reward points on Amazon that I used to buy it. 
I am not his PR team and I’m not here to advertise for him, but honestly, I think that his photos were the most convincing in this magazine, because I don’t understand how they take their photos, but the other homes look messy, too much stuff, the photos are… “flat”, I don’t know if it’s the right word, I’m not a photographer, there is no depth, so everything jumps out to our eyes, it’s very confusing to look at, except for Drew’s photos because they are simpler. He is giving a few good ideas and advice in it, so kudos to Drew of Lone Fox! He is taken seriously by the home decor press. He is way far ahead of M. now, definitely.

My town is in shambles, and I feel some of the fault is my own. 

For the past 40 hours I have been at my desk fielding calls from all over the area. People are hurting, dying. And there’s so little I can do. 

When they can someone from Greenbrier PD will drop off food, water and fuel for the generator. The call center must stay open, it’s something that has been ingrained into us as far back as middle school. 

It's why the pay is so high, it’s why the building is built like a bunker. But generations of ease have led to things being neglected. Equipment that should have been updated was ignored, maintenance left undone. 

I need a break, I get an hour of sleep here and there but the phones are always busy. There’s been a call for volunteers but no takers yet. 

By now everyone has heard that I’m alone here, that everyone else that worked here is missing. 

I heard the mayor made a call to our governor, but as in times before we were told to handle our own affairs. We really are on our own. 

I haven’t updated the board, I haven’t filled out reports. I don’t know how this will affect things in the future but I simply don’t have the time. 

All missing persons calls are being forwarded to the church turned shelter on Hugh Everett Avenue. That way I can focus on the people who need immediate help. 

In the last hour I talked a mother through putting a tourniquet on her child’s leg when a stray bullet came through their wall shattering the bone and severing an artery. A man who needed an ambulance after his dog, who had been laying there peacefully suddenly exploded taking the man’s arm with it. Then there was the case of someone claiming a raccoon had gotten into his gun cabinet and stolen a valuable M1 Garand. 

That last one wasn’t worth the polices time, not with everything else going on. 

Jordan showed up, I couldn’t believe it. He walked in looking no different than normal. He went to his office, organized a few things then came back out. 

“Take a break Kylie, you’re tired and your work performance is reflecting it. I’ll man the phones for the next couple hours”. I just stared at him, the voice in my headset sounded muted. 

With an annoyed sigh Jordan walked over and pulled my headset off of me and put it in himself. “This is Greenbrier 911, sorry for the inconvenience could you state the nature of your emergency?” 

I wanted to hit him, I wanted to scream. I wanted answers, but I needed sleep. In my current state of mind I doubted I would even understand anything he had to say. 

I made my way to the lobby, to my surprise there was an air mattress with a blanket waiting for me. That’s not all, there was a table with food and drinks. Most disturbing was the stack of my own clothes folded on the floor. 

It was almost enough to make me stomp back into the call room and demand an explanation. But that bed was too welcoming. 

I don’t know what time it was when I went to sleep, and I don’t know how long I slept for. When I woke up I had to pee so bad I’m surprised I made it to the bathroom. After shedding five pounds of monster and coffee I felt a lot better. 

Leaving the bathroom I saw Jordan was still manning the phone. I didn’t miss the stack of reports neatly organized next to him. 

He briefly glanced in my direction. “Don’t even start Kylie. We have a lot of catching up to do”. I slapped him hard enough to knock him out of his chair. He looked stunned for a moment. A little bit of fear cut through my anger as Jordan stood up, I was suddenly aware of just how isolated we were. He looked down at me, “I could fire you for that”. 

I humphed in disbelief, “really? And who would take my place? It’s time to start talking Jordan, who’s blood is that? Where is everyone? And why were you in my house?”

The phone rang, Jordan reached for it but I hit the cancel button. “Start talking or I’m out”. He was pissed, the slap had been a minor annoyance, but hanging up really set him off. 

“Kylie you are so inconceivably stupid sometimes, the call center has to stay open. And that’s means answering calls!” Jordan pushed me back before hitting the redial button. 

I let him field the call, someone likely needed help after all. But as soon as he was done I was going to rip into him. 

The second I saw the green light go out I dropped my ultimatum on him. “Tell me what is going on or I’m leaving, you’ll have to handle everything yourself. Sooner or later you’ll pass out and the phones will go unanswered”. 

Jordan watched me with cold eyes, “as for the people who will die, you are ok with that? Because that is what leaving would lead to”. 

He had me and he knew it, I tried a different approach. “Jordan will you please just tell me what you know? My life has gone to hell the last month and I would appreciate some answers”. 

We sat in silence for an uncomfortable amount of time. “I don’t have all the answers. Or even a lot of answers, the things you’ve dealt with aren’t hell on earth. That would be the thing you let out of that room. We have to take the calls, I don’t know why but I know things get a lot worse if we don’t answer the phones”. Jordan stood and walked to his desk, he opened a drawer and pulled out a paper. 

It was a check list, no more like a list of rules. 

1.	The station must be manned at all times, if for any reason the station is left absent immediately take shelter until the situation is remedied. 
2.	All incomplete calls must be redialed as soon as possible. 
3.	The power must remain on at the station, take any action necessary to achieve this. 
4.	Do not enter ________ unless required. 
5.	This station is the fourth and final barrier, as such it shall receive the utmost attention at all times. 
I pointed to the fourth rule, “why is that blacked out? Where can’t we enter? And what does five mean? Seriously this just adds more questions”. 

Jordan took the page and walked back to his desk where he locked it away. “I don’t know Kylie, maybe it’s the basement? Maybe it’s somewhere entirely different. As to rule five, I have a hunch as to what two of the other barriers might be”. 

“Wait… this place has a basement??” Jordan nodded, “yeah, there’s an access outside. It’s locked up tight though, looks like it’s been that way for a long time”. 

I was glad that was the case, I wasn’t ready to face anymore basements. Not yet at least. 

“Ok, what are the other two barriers? And what are they barriers against?” 

“Really? Do I need to spoon feed you everything? What two places have the most red pins around them?” I glanced at the board but I really didn’t need to, I already knew. There were two obvious clusters, one in the woods at the top of a hill and the other just outside of town. 

“And the third?” Jordan looked at the map, “I don’t know, but if those two clusters are two of them. And we’re the fourth I would assume the third would be where there is no cluster at all”. 

I followed his gaze, Darkwood Park. 

“The government building?” The section of Darkwood that was fenced off didn’t have a single pin, causing it to stand out from the rest of the area. 

Just then the phone rang, Jordan held out the headset. “Your turn”. 

I took it, “don’t think I’m done here, I’ll have more questions in a minute”. 

As I sat to handle the call Jordan walked into the lobby. 

“Greenbrier 911 what is your emergency?” 

“There’s a crucifix in my thigh!” Yelled a male voice with a bit of an accent. “Ok sir, let’s get a few details and get some help on the way. Did someone do this to you or was it self-inflicted?” 

“Ah hell you think I’d do this myself? Naw lady, I just woke up with my leg a burning and BAM! By golly there it was, a cross under my skin”. 

“That’s definitely a situation where we can help, what is your location and name?” 

“Al Smith, my friends call me Big Al. I’m in my house down by Radio Lane, you know, the road that goes to the radio station”. 

I punched in his info and sent it to Greenbrier FD, “I have help on route, could you help me understand how this might have happened?” 

“Listen little lady, I live two miles from the radio station on subsidized land. Need I say more?” He really didn’t but I wanted to keep him on the line until help arrived or another call came in. 

“I understand how that could…” I was interrupted by the callers pained yelp, “oh sweet baby ray! It’s a growing!” His breathing grew stressed, “where them at lady? Where them at? Ahhh owie it’s hurting!”

I bumped his call up an urgency level, “help is on the way, can you describe the situation so I can have them briefed when they arrive?” 

The caller groaned in pain, “it… It’s… By golly!” 

There was a thunk, like the phone had dropped to the ground followed by whimpering. 

“Sir? Sir are you there?” A single gasp was my only reply. Still, I remained on the line until the paramedics arrived. 

I heard them pounding on the door and announcing their presence. When there was no reply I confirmed they were in the right place, they kicked down the thin door. 

“What the fuck?” Exclaimed one of the two medics. The other one shushed him, “hey get a move on, he’s still alive”. I had to piece together what was happening by the sounds. It wasn’t until I heard a chainsaw fire up that I really began to grow concerned. 

I was able to grab a few details from the fire departments dispatch. The medics had arrived to find a 56 year old man unconscious in his dilapidated double wide. His left leg had been entirely replaced with the main beam of an ornate wooden cross. 

The cross beam had pressed its way into his right hip socket shattering the bone. The other half of the cross beam had burst from his left hip. The top of the cross was buried deep in his bowels. 

Call it a miracle or living hell but big Al was still alive. He would need both his legs amputated but he would pull through. 

That call sucked. So I was almost glad when the next call was some Karen angry about the music next door. “Greenbrier 911 what is your…” 

“Listen, I’m only going to say this once. The kids next door have been playing the same song on full volume for an hour! Please have someone make them stop”. 

Personally I hate it when people cut me off, if you’re dying I’ll be pretty lenient on your manners. But when it’s just something like an annoying neighbor you really ought to be more polite. 

“Ma’am this is 911 please refrain from using this number for petty grievances. The police station has a non emergency number for such things”. 

As expected she did not like hearing that. “Excuse me but I already called them! And they did nothing!” I couldn’t help but smile, “perhaps that’s because it’s not an issue?” Now normally I’m not like that, but the stress of everything made me not really care in the moment. 

The woman huffed in offense, “does an hour of hearing nothing but this not deserve at least a knock on the door?” I heard what sounded like a window opening and then a rhythmic beat. And the faint hint of lyrics, they were repeating over and over. “Kylie’s gonna die, Kylie’s gonna die…” 

Maybe a drive by was warranted after all. 

There was a break between calls so I went to the lobby to find Jordan. Annoyingly he was no where to be found. I called out a couple times, checked the outdoor security cameras, nothing. He had left the building. 

After a few choice words I had to rush back inside as the phone had started ringing. 

I jumped into my chair and hit the button, “Greenbrier 911 what’s your emergency?” 

‘You’ll have to excuse my ignorance but I didn’t know who else to call. You see I slipped and I believe I’m injured”. 

“Ok ma’am, you called the right place. Could I get an address or location?” 

The lady replied, “oh of course, silly me. It’s 666 Exorcist Circle”. 

I sat there for a moment rubbing my temples, I really didn’t need this right now. “Ma’am there is no Exorcist Circle in Greenbrier”. 

The lady’s tone took on a somber note, “I know dear, but that’s what the voice made me say”. The line went dead. 

As much as I didn’t want to I called back only to reach a disconnected line. I noted it on my report. A shiver ran through my body, this place was feeling a lot less safe the longer I stayed. 

Jordan returned about the time I was ready to pass out. He threw a duffel bag at me then sat in the chair next to mine and put on a headset. “Take your break Kylie”. 

Out of curiosity I looked in the bag, it had more changes of clothes as well as toiletries from my house. I blushed first with embarrassment but then with anger. “Jordan did you go snooping around my house?” 

He didn't even bother looking up from my report that he was needlessly going over. “nope”. 

I shoved the bag into his face, “than how did you get this?” 

Jordan brushed the bag aside, “Kylie you need a nap, you’re being emotional. Your house is a crime scene, an officer handed that to me outside ten minutes ago”. 

I wasn’t sure if I believed him or not. Either way I wouldn’t be apologizing. 

I’ll admit it did feel good to change into fresh clothes again. There was a home cooked meal waiting in the lobby as well. As much as I wanted to return home or to challenge Jordan I was just too tired. I crashed onto the cot and fell instantly asleep. 

When I woke up I knew something was wrong, the lobby was quiet and dark. The generator wasn’t running. 

I jumped from my makeshift bed and threw a hoodie on. I ran outside wincing at the feeling of rocks biting into my bare feet. 

The generator was located at the back of the building under a little roof. It was an ancient but reliable relic dating back to the second world war. 

We had never had a problem with it before. I came around the corner and saw someone standing in front of it. I couldn’t see who they were but judging by the height I assumed it was Jordan. 

“Are we out of fuel?” The figure shook its head and turned the start switch, the old beast fired up and the lights started to warm revealing the man standing in front of me to be Andy. 

“Andy! Where have you been? I was worried, things have been so crazy lately and Jordan is being weirder then normal and… Andy?” 

His face was expressionless. He was just staring. I shivered involuntarily, “Andy are you ok?” I went to take a step closer but hesitated. Something was off, Andy raised an arm in my direction, he then slowly rotated it until his palm was facing up. 

Curling his fingers Andy motioned for me to come closer. I really didn’t want to, Andy was someone I almost considered a friend. He was clearly in distress, but I didn’t budge. 

It was then that he took a stiff step forward. I was frozen in place, “Andy please, what’s going on?” As he drew closer I felt my eyes start to water, there was no humanity in his eyes. Just an emptiness. 

He was nearly within reach, I couldn’t bring myself to move. Someone walked up beside me, Jordan. He leveled a shotgun and without hesitation pulled the trigger. 

I screamed as my face was coated in Andy. His headless corpse wobbled for a moment before collapsing. I nearly fell as well but Jordan pulled me backwards. 

“Kylie you’re supposed to be manning the lines”. Something inside me snapped, I drove my knee into Jordan’s crotch as hard as I could. He grunted but didn’t let go of the back of my shirt. 

I punched and kicked at him in a futile effort. With a single arm around my chest Jordan picked me up and started walking into the woods. 

My anger turned to fear, I had done it. I had finally pissed him off and now he was going to kill me. 

I screamed for help but Jordan took no notice. It wasn’t long before he threw me onto the ground. I lay there on the wet leaves looking into a trench. 

At the bottom lay at least a dozen bodies. I struggled not to scream again. I tried to scramble back but Jordan pushed me back to the edge. 

“Look at them Kylie”. I didn’t want to, the smell of blood and shit was enough. Jordan insisted, “look at them, tell me what you see”. His voice terrifyingly calm. 

So I did, I looked at what I had thought was a pile of people. But it was a pile of persons. They were all Andy. Every single body was dressed the same and looked the same, down to the shotgun wounds in various places. 

“You need to start trusting me Kylie, had that thing gotten a hold of you it would have killed you just like the first one nearly did to me”. 

Grabbing my arm he pulled me to my feet, “now we need to get back to the call center”.

1gbz0mi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI__Stories/comments/1gbz0mi/through_fire_and_ash/,Through Fire and Ash,"The man’s name was Marcus, and he was a soldier unlike any other. It wasn’t that he was stronger, faster, or even smarter than his comrades—but somehow, battle after battle, he was the only one to walk away alive. At first, his survival seemed like sheer luck, an oddity among the brutal chaos of war. But after the fourth time, then the fifth, he began to notice things. Small details others might miss—the subtle shifts in his enemies’ stances, the dull flicker of doubt in their eyes. Each battle became a teacher, shaping him into a more perceptive, efficient warrior.

As he grew sharper, Marcus naturally rose in the ranks. Soon he commanded squads, then whole platoons, his men inspired by the tales of his miraculous escapes from death. They called him the ""Ghost of the Front,"" an unkillable phantom who led them through fire and smoke. Other leaders watched from afar, strategizing from the safety of tents and command centers, but not Marcus. He was always there, in the thick of it, pushing his men to press forward while taking the brunt of the assault himself.

Every battle sharpened his instincts. He learned when to step left instead of right, to duck a fraction of a second before a spear whistled past. He adapted, modified his tactics, and his survival wasn’t luck anymore—it was skill honed to a razor’s edge.

Years passed, and he became a legend. His men trusted him as they would a blade in their hands, following him without question. Yet as his legend grew, he felt the weight of it more. He began to wonder if his miraculous survival was some cosmic joke, a string of coincidences meant to keep him forever on the front lines. But he didn’t question it too much; each battle was a new puzzle to solve, and he would learn everything it had to offer. Death, he thought, was inevitable, but he intended to push it off for as long as he could.

One day, in a battle fiercer than any he’d ever fought, Marcus finally felt the end creeping close. He’d dodged dozens of arrows, evaded enemies that seemed to materialize from thin air, and pushed his men forward like never before. But as the dust began to settle, he felt a sharp, searing pain in his chest. He glanced down to see the blood blooming like a dark rose, spreading across his armor.

He fell to his knees, his vision dimming, but at that moment, Marcus didn’t feel regret or fear. Instead, he felt a deep satisfaction, a strange peace. The thought crossed his mind that it had been a miracle he’d made it this far, that he had become more than he’d ever imagined. And he was happy with that. Happy to finally let go.

But then, as his eyes closed, he heard a faint beeping. A screen flickered in front of him, the words *Simulation Ended* glowing softly in the dim light of his apartment. He was back in his cramped living room, surrounded by stacks of bills and empty coffee cups, the reality of his ordinary life sinking in like a heavy weight.

Marcus took a deep breath and removed the headset, shaking off the last remnants of the battle that wasn’t real. He had escaped death a thousand times, but here, in his mundane, endless routine, there was no such thrill—just the dull ache of a life that felt as monotonous as the hum of his virtual machine.",1,1729875329.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False

In my not so far future I want kids, a home to one day call my own and someone to marry. unfortunately none of that can come about, if we live in two completely different towns. I live in a rural state where you (mostly) have to drive upwards of  20 minutes to get anywhere. So distance never really bothered me. Until about four years ago when I realized it was time to (in a sense) grow up and start moving forward with our plans of a future, that we so endlessly talked of. When this first started he always talked of getting a better job in order to provide. I thought nothing of it and was happy he would want to provide in the first place. So in 2020 we planned on a year of him looking for and getting the security of a well paying job. Unfortunately his grandma got terminally sick. So we packed up all his things and moved him into her house in a different town about an hour from his home town. Where he could be there for her final days. He’s there for a year(2021). Sadly she passes. He’s back at square one. I ask him what his plans are since I believe now would be a good time for us to move in. As the job market was booming in my town. He refuses saying he can’t afford it and doesn’t have the resume, to up and move towns. With that he moves back to his home town to live with some friends of his and get a job at a local coffee shop. I was up set but ultimately wanted the best for him. So I helped move him in with his friends. He’s there for about 7 months before having some altercations with his friends now roommates and started thinking of moving out. So I again bring the idea of him transferring with his job as we had the same coffee shop in my town as well. And we could figure things out from there. He tells me that his job wouldn’t let him transfer and dramatically cut his hours from about 40 to 20-25. So he’s struggling with money again. Looking for something safe he moves back in with his parents. At this point im insecure with the relationship and where I stand in his future, and as his partner. He reassures me that im his end goal and “the one” for him. He just needs time to find a better job. I believe him. At this point it’s the new year 2022.  We have a very traumatic event take place right in January of the new year. Neither of us handled it well and we ended up splitting for about 4 months. We get back together and plan on healing what had been lost in our relationship for the foreseeable future. We both try therapy and things are mending pretty well. He ends up quitting the coffee shop job and  trying his hand in his own business. It went fine. Less than adequate. Fast forward to early spring of 2023. He finally gets the good cushy job he’s been waiting for. We set a plan for him to work there for about a year then transfer. Fast forward a year…. It’s the end of winter early spring. I again bring up that he should transfer and move in with me. He attempts to get his boss to transfer him. It doesn’t work. For four months we try to get the transfer. To no avail. At this point I’m tired of trying to get things to work out as well as him not finding other options or committing to this decision. But I decide to give it time. Fast forward to September 2024. He loses his job. Seeing as he no longer has any ties to his home town. I once again ask him to move in with me. He and I had more than enough money combined to get a cozy 2-3 bedroom place. While he could work on getting a job and I could support us until he did. He never said no. Yet he never looked for places. Wouldn’t go with me to look at places I picked out, outright denied places I wanted. Then completely started “giving up” in a sense. He stopped all compassion in the relationship. Stopped saying good morning and goodnight. Would ignore me when out with friends. Wouldn’t tell me if he was busy. Calls became monotonous and dreary.  Everything about our already very limited relationship became chore like and boring. It felt like he had just completely given up. But would say things like “I was all he wanted” and “without me he didn’t know what to do with himself”. We started seeing each other less. Truly it became more like long distance friends that were slightly annoyed at how the other became over the years. He spent his money on simple desires like a gaming computer, a new bike, and art supplies. All the while complaining about his living situation and losing weight due to stress.  When  we could have been saving for our future and thinking of ways to close the gap that was driving us apart. It genuinely started to drive me crazy I felt like I was a bad person for wanting to take the next steps in our life. I felt sick all the time like I was being lied to. Toyed with. Like I had tied a noose around my neck and given him the rope. I wanted so badly for us to be together for us to work towards a common goal that would eventually lead us to “happily ever after”. I don’t know. By the end of it I really don’t know what I was doing I love him I truly do. Even now I just want to be with him. I just want him to be with me. We watched each other grow up after all there’s no way he’d do that to me right? No way… well tough shit I guess. The universe doesn’t care whether you believe it or not. It was never happening. This future I craved so desperately was just a figment of my imagination. I convinced myself that even though he was lost or stuck. We would figure it out. Make it through. As long as I showed him I was there. That I’d face anything with him walk to the ends of the earth with him. That together we’d be unstoppable. Haha too bad the one thing that stopped us was me. Just to be told in the end. He wanted to do it together…… Biggest punch in the gut. Not in a sense of a relationship but physically. Like he wanted to be in the room with me filling out applications…… that’s why he never bothered looking or trying. Or getting a place with me. So yeah there’s the last four years of a relationship that I actually made myself delusional for. Or maybe I was delusional all along. Sounds about right. All I know is I feel like I gave him pieces of myself I will never get back. I realized he didn’t love me like I loved him. I just don’t know why I waited. I really don’t. It was my choice in the end I can’t blame him. Would you let a random stray that’s been following you around all day, in your home to be your pet just because it chose you? I just love him and that’s what hurts the most I love him so much and it hurts that we are on different depths of love. If he loved me at all… our last conversation together made me realize he loved me in a completely different way than I loved him. He said “you’ll never find someone who knows you as much as I do”. This is true. I hope to never find someone who would learn me. Be with me. And then reject a future with me out of fear for themselves. I hope to meet someone that’s willing to make the same commitments as I. Although right now I couldn’t imagine being with anyone.

So, I'm making a game where npcs ask if they can have an item like a coffee and then you have to give it to them but first i decided to work on the questions. I made a list (the one in the image) that has all the things they can ask for, like lemonade and stuff, but when I click on this it always says 0 rather than one of the items in the list...what i was doing here made sense in my head but I think the pick random 1 to 10 block is restricted to only numbers which is a shame since i dont know how else i could achieve this...if you can could you suggest something else?",1,1729875182.0,scratch,4,1.0,False
1gbyyjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gbyyjx/first_time_that_sobriety_is_hitting_hard/,First time that sobriety is hitting hard ,"Hey guy, sorry it might be a bit long I need to vent 

I’ve been sober for almost a year now, after years of trying to stop and repeatedly relapsing. I attended AA meetings for a year before really stopping, and then one day, I just stopped drinking and haven’t wanted to drink again since.

For the past few months, I haven’t really thought about my drinking past—I almost forgot how things were. Honestly, it felt amazing not to define myself solely as an alcoholic.

Today, I finally decided to reach out to an old friend I hadn’t spoken to since the start of my sobriety journey two years ago. Back then, I was two months sober but relapsed a week before we were supposed to meet. On the day I was meant to see her, I drank, blacked out, and don’t remember if I ever actually met her. I was so ashamed that I didn’t contact her again—until today.

Since I’ve been feeling good lately and more open to reconnecting (I’m not as afraid of people anymore—yay!), I thought it was time to message her. In my message, I mentioned I’d love to grab a coffee sometime if she was interested. She replied kindly, saying she was never mad at me and was glad I was doing better now. She said if I ever needed help, I could reach out to her. She also mentioned that she’s now living in another city but welcomed me to visit anytime. I feel I did something bad and now it puzzls me. 

Her message brought back a lot of memories from my darker days, and I’m not sure how I feel right now—it’s unsettling. I even found myself briefly thinking about drinking again, something I hadn’t considered for almost a year.

Reality has a way of being harsh sometimes, and even though life feels good now, the past wasn’t easy. I wonder if reopening it was the right choice.

I have an AA friend who I haven’t spoken to in a few months due to a misunderstanding, but she’s doing better now, and we’ve started talking again. She’s on vacation, though, and I don’t want to bother her with this, so I’m venting here instead.

I haven’t attended AA meetings in a while, but maybe it’s time to go back. Sometimes, it’s better to keep the past closed.

1gbyn3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1gbyn3y/my_husband_betrayed_me_while_i_was_recovering/,My husband betrayed me while I was recovering from surgery. He has since tried to make it up to me but I’ve just lost interest in him. Why do I feel too guilty to leave?," I have posted about this before here but I’m in the middle of writing my PhD dissertation so my brain is kind of scattered and I could use some more outside perspectives given new developments. 

Last month, my husband went to a work conference (he’s a couples therapist) while I was 10 days post-op from endometriosis surgery and came back to tell me he went to coffee and cuddled with another couples therapist from the conference.  He initially dismissed my feelings about it, saying that it’s not a big deal, and he’s proud of himself for stopping at cuddling. After several days of back and forth, he finally started to feel bad and decided he needed to make it up to me. He has apologized and started to be more proactive about things in the relationship. 

Here’s the thing - before this, I’ve felt for some time that I am the writer, producer, director, and actor within our lives and he has just been barely an actor. He has just been passive and careless, and this betrayal is evidence of his carelessness. An example of his carelessness is that he forgot about our first fertility clinic appointment, despite me reminding him twice in the weeks leading up to it. He says he really wants kids but he does not actively pursue it, nor does he actively pursue anything related to us. Even after the endometriosis surgery, he barely noticed I was in pain. So this incident while I was post-op has been the straw that broke the camels back, and I feel like I no longer even want to work on this marriage.  

But he’s trying and I believe underneath it all, he’s a good person. He’s never yelled at me and he knows I like peonies. Since this incident... He has expressed a lot of emotion. He has been checking on my pain levels daily (because I called him out on his lack of care). He booked me a week long writers retreat so I can work on my dissertation and packed me a care package. He has made a couple of date plans. He paid a parking ticket of mine without asking. Still, there’s something missing. He’s just not… it. I ask him where he’d like to live after I graduate, he says he hasn’t thought about it. He doesn’t think much at all. He doesn’t challenge me. He doesn’t inspire me. 


I’m tired and sometimes I don’t even like him anymore but I feel like maybe a divorce would be more tiring? Maybe if I keep hitting my head on the metaphorical wall, he will continue this streak of trying? And things will get better as we are in couple therapy? I don’t know what to do and I’d feel guilty leaving him because now he’s become aware of all his flaws and he’s working on them. ",64,1729874361.0,AskWomenOver30,120,0.89,False

****A Journey from 3 times master admission rejections in Pakistan due to #low_CGPA to getting a Researcher Position at #Cornell_University Ivy league  USA world top rank USA university

Hello, friends, I am sharing this post again for newcomers. After this post in August 2022. I tried my best to guide mostly students in the comment section. Of 200 students, 10% got scholarships and the other 20% got a positive reply from their prospective professor.

***Please read the full story before #commenting. I hope you will get a lot of help regarding How to work on yourself? how to find labs at top universities ? and how to contact the prospective professor. I will try my best to help you. Thanks 😊

My name is( student from Mailsi , city of south Punjab) . I did my Bachelor’s at the University of Agriculture Faisalabad Pakistan with 3.0 CGPA. From my bachelor's study at university, I came to know that, doing a degree without practical knowledge is just a piece of paper. **To pursue practical knowledge,** I decided to apply for admission to the national top biological research institutes, CEMB, NIBGE, and NIAB. I tried 3 times consecutively from 2016 to 2019 for admission but got rejections due to my low GPA and 2nd division in matric, At the same time, I was a Biology teacher in Unique and KIPS. But my intrinsic desire of learning more and more about biological sciences and do practical research was increasing. I was also doing online courses regarding biological sciences from Coursera. come and edx.I applied 30 times for scholarships, one time I got a call from the Netherlands embassy, but was not on the final list. I also got rejections from all other 30 within 3 to 4 years. **My passion was to do research, but I was drowning in the marsh of scholarship rejections**. At one time I decided to leave my passion **(bhoot)** for research and start to do as usual farm business in my village. During these days compulsive thoughts were coming to my mind, that if I will not do that, then who will, Basically I was only from my family/cast/village who reached university level. I was thinking at that time that, If I will give up, then no one from my village and my family would be able to reach university level ( **Jaisay kehtay hyn ka IS na parh kar kia kar lia jo tum agay parho gay, ya jumla bahot ziada bola jata ha hamaray middle /lower class families ma)**. Then I decided to keep applying for scholarships. Luckily I was selected for a master's at a well-reputed Saudi Arabia university, the selection email was like a torch at the end of the tunnel. From that day, I decided to work day and night. In the first two months, I published one paper in a peer-reviewed journal with 7 impact factor. After 4/4 CGPA in the first semester, I got master's thesis position at Academia Sinica Taiwan (the world's top research institute) where I inserted the first time 6.5 kb gene into the Zebrafish genome through CRISPR/Cas9 (biologists know better about it). Same time I was publishing in good impact factors journals. Before going to Taiwan I was working in a nanomaterial lab, then after coming back from Taiwan, I developed an idea to make a nanomaterial-based biosensor to detect **Covid-19**, Because I got the expertise to handle DNA/RNA stuff from Taiwan. ( Jab ap practical kam kartay ho to pher ap ka mind sa new problem solving practical ideas generate hotay chalay jatay hyn). Your mind is a magnet, the law of attraction is occurring everywhere. When you do real practical work, then your mind started to generate a lot of problem-solving ideas automatically. If you love practical sciences, thinking practically links you with the unknown world of nature that help you to discover something. At that point, I realized that, if you can combine two fields, then a discovery happens. That was our discovery. Now from that point, there were two things in my hand, one CRISPR/Cas9 edited practical work and experience in the development of biosensors to detect viruses, like Covid-19. During my master thesis, I developed a zebrafish genetic modified line, which could help to understand the cardiac regeneration in zebrafish at the molecular level. Stop here. I want to share with you one thing that, Human and mammals cannot regenerate their hearts because the death of a few heart cells cause a heart attack but the zebrafish ( research model organism) living in oceans can regenerate their heart completely 100% if you cut 90% of zebrafish heart. Ok, let's continue my story, as my zebrafish line was related to heart regeneration, I decided to continue my future research in cardiac regeneration and started to explore the labs in a top university related to my research interest. **THIS MATTERS A LOT**.** ****Aligning your past research experience with professors' ongoing lab projects is very important.**** **I sent emails to professors who were working in the cardiac regeneration domains of oxford and Cornell Universities. Luckily, I got a reply from a Cornell University professor. Why did I get a reply from a top university professor? First please see my attached email file. Let's talk about my first email to a professor, I have made points, 1 , 2,3 in red colors. In the first 1, point, you should mention what you have done in your past research, in the second (2) point you should do a literature review about your research field and **FIND THE GAP**, As I mentioned that Bruton, et al, did this but he was unable to find macrophage and regeneration coordination.. This is the current research gap of my research area. Pont number 3, show the passion that, I want to solve this issue, as I mention, I am passionate to decode the crosstalk of macrophages with epicardium regeneration in the zebrafish heart. Then in the last paragraph, you should mention that I came across, or if you have any research assistant/doctorate, etc position, I would be more than happy to work on it. Thanks, don’t forget to put smiley emoji after thanks. This effect a lot. After one day, I received an interview call. Then I switched off my phone and started to prepare for the interview for 5 days. I read a lot about lab past research, what methodology he used in his research, and on which issue they are working.** I prepared 10 slides of my past work and other 10 slides with the possible hypothesis, which I could do in his lab to solve the lab's ongoing issues.** After the presentation, He commented **wow great**, **He told me that, I am taking you research assistant for Cornell/Harvard collaborative project. Later on, he sent me a Harvard professor lab link. He asked me when you can join our labs?, I replied, Thanks Dr. I can join your lab by January 2023. He suggested applying for a doctorate program at both universities. Last night he sent me an email that, I signed your contract and sent it to the HR manager, soon you will receive it. **Apply for a USA visa soon. It takes usually 2 to 3 months.** Our HR will guide you. That its.

Guys Personally, I want to share something with you that I followed and achieved these things.

1. ****Look Inside the researcher's mind**, Use your mind 100% working efficiently**. How can you get it? let’s discuss, First of remove all types of fears from your mind. I think fears are a big hurdle in your dream journey and fears are directly proportional to 1)anxiety, 2) depression 3) stress 4) anger 5 )ego. How can we remove it? You can remove these fears by the development of enlightenment, enlightenment simply is living 100% in present without any tiny thought of your past and future, (bcz past and future contain ego). When you do this, you develop peace, calm, love, and innovation, you can try and feel it now. I am also trying to follow; Try it daily, this strategy will give you a lot of success. Every time your mind becomes more and more powerful.

2. **Never give up**, this is your life, you can make it or destroy it. Just work hard, If a low CGPA student can do it you can also do it..

3. **Write your goals,** sit for 10 minutes every day alone, and think over, how can I do my best to achieve my goals then write strategies that come to your mind. This is an innovator's magnet strategy which usually ends up with a big achievement.

4. **Keep every time End in your mind,** For example when I was working in Taiwan, I faced criticism for not having practical experience, but same time I was telling myself that, I am doing great work, which can help me to secure the best Ph.D. position. This feeling every time converts the negative criticism to positive criticism.

**5.Try to make a list of top professors in your research area **and follows their research work, if they are going to any conference then try to go there and arrange a meeting with them to discuss your future.

6. **Publish** research papers even review in impact factors journals (beware fake journals, these can destroy your career) one paper in high impact factor journals like Nature, cell, IEE Transaction, is better than 100 low Impact factors journals.

7. If you are an undergraduate student, **use your every summer for an internship in research centers **for biologists CEMB Lahore, NIGBE or NIAB are very good. Try international internships, like the UGrade USA exchange program, OIST Japan/EPFL/oxford/TIGP internships, you can google more undergrad international internships. For master students, try to select those professors as advisors who are active in their fields regarding research/innovations. Please try to do at least your Ph.D. in a top university.

8.** Make a list of top-rank universities in your field**, and start to prepare your documents 6 months ahead of the deadline. Try to choose the top laboratories in your research area usually top laboratories pass the university ranking in your career.

**Remember, if you follow the above guidelines, I believe inshallah one day you will be in a top university. I know, NEVER GIVE UP, NOW I am at Cornell starting PhD soon after 6 month of researcher job, during that duration, I developed three gene mutants zebrafish lines.  ( you can see my first-day coffee in Cornell Mug).Thanks 😊😊

Normally we love all our stays, especially Holiday inns. Some aren't exceptional but are usually clean, and has all amenities available, reasonable price, etc. 

I had the worst stay at one recently, the Holiday inn across from Universal in Orlando FL. 

The paid parking system was infuriating, having to scan a QR and then send a text to get in and out, just not fun, but whatever, would have been fine if it worked. Except we got locked out at 2am after coming back from Halloween horror nights. Kept getting a message saying entry restricted. Ended up having to go to a different gate on the other side of the building, which was also broken. 

We had 2 cars in our group and should have been charged $50 ($25/ car/ night) which is already steep, but whatever it's Orlando, instead one of the cars was double charged so we paid over $80 to park for less than 24hrs. 

My mother came with us to watch our kid while we went to HHN at universal, and a big selling point of this hotel was the heated indoor pool. The pool was ice cold, totally unusable. 

Paid for the breakfast option in the morning, which is a voucher for a connected tgi Friday breakfast buffet (that's a new one for me) and it was inedible. Everything was cold and hard, coffee was gross. 

The hallways on every floor we went to smelled of urine, almost like a Cat had sprayed. 

The room itself was JUST OK, if it was only the room being drab, with chipping paint, loose sockets, and outlets that didn't function, I probably wouldn't be upset at all. Im usually very easy to please, and almost never complain. This is my first time complaining about a stay EVER. But when my group spent over $500 for 1 night with parking, you expect a little better service. 

After talking with support all they said their apologies and said they are giving me 10,000 points. I feel like that's hardly anything, like what $50 in monetary value? What should I ask for? Do they usually give stay credit or refunds? ",1,1729874095.0,ihghotelsresorts,6,0.67,False

Waiting for Bitcoin transactions to confirm can sometimes feel like watching paint dry, especially during peak network times. But don’t worry—Bitcoin TX Accelerate has entered the chat! This handy transaction accelerator lets you speed up those sluggish confirmations and wave goodbye to frustration. Think of Bitcoin TX Accelerate as your personal crypto speed dialer, sending your transactions zooming through the blockchain.

Ready to dive into the nitty-gritty of this turbo tool? Let’s go!

# Why Do Bitcoin Transactions Even Slow Down?

Bitcoin, as awesome as it is, sometimes has a bottleneck issue. Imagine a highway jam-packed with cars (transactions) all trying to make their way through a toll booth (miners) during rush hour. Transactions are processed based on the fees attached, so the ones with higher fees usually get the green light first. If your transaction has a lower fee, it could be waiting in that traffic jam for hours… or even days.

That’s where **Bitcoin TX Accelerate** swoops in to save the day! By giving your transaction a bit of a boost, it can nudge it higher in the priority queue and get it confirmed faster than you can say “blockchain.”

# How Does Bitcoin TX Accelerate Work?

Bitcoin TX Accelerate takes a “no muss, no fuss” approach to boosting your transaction speed. All you need to do is submit your stuck transaction details, and the accelerator does the rest. Here’s a quick breakdown of how it works:

1. **Enter Your Transaction ID**: Pop your transaction ID into the Bitcoin TX Accelerate tool. This ID is like the tracking number for your package, letting the tool locate your transaction in the Bitcoin network.
2. **Magic Happens Behind the Scenes**: Bitcoin TX Accelerate uses a blend of technology and strategic fee optimization to give your transaction a push. No complex sign-ups or hidden steps—just enter, accelerate, and go.
3. **Faster Confirmation Times**: Now that your transaction is pushed up the queue, confirmations roll in quicker, ensuring your Bitcoin reaches its destination without unnecessary delays.

Check out the simple setup at [Bitcoin TX Accelerate](https://www.txaccelerate.com) and get that transaction flying through the network!

# Who Needs Bitcoin TX Accelerate?

You might wonder if a transaction accelerator is really necessary. While some users may not mind waiting, others—especially businesses, traders, and anyone in a rush—rely on quick confirmations. Here are a few situations where Bitcoin TX Accelerate can be a total game-changer:

* **Bitcoin Traders**: Timing can be crucial in trading. A delayed confirmation could mean missing out on an opportunity. With Bitcoin TX Accelerate, traders can get their transactions confirmed faster, helping them stay ahead of the game.
* **Merchants**: Running an online store? Accepting Bitcoin payments is fantastic until a customer’s payment gets stuck in limbo. By using Bitcoin TX Accelerate, merchants can smooth out payment processing, keeping customers happy and business running smoothly.
* **Everyday Users**: Whether it’s sending funds to a friend or paying for a service, no one likes to wait. Bitcoin TX Accelerate is perfect for anyone who needs their Bitcoin transactions to move faster—just enter, accelerate, and it’s done!

# How Does Bitcoin TX Accelerate Stand Out?

Bitcoin TX Accelerate isn’t the only transaction accelerator out there, but it’s definitely one of the friendliest to use. Here’s why:

1. **No Account Needed**: With Bitcoin TX Accelerate, there’s no need to create an account. It’s as easy as typing in your transaction ID and hitting submit—no frills, just speed.
2. **Fee Efficiency**: Not only does Bitcoin TX Accelerate expedite your transaction, but it’s also savvy about doing it cost-effectively. Think of it as a smart hack to get your Bitcoin moving without throwing tons of extra fees at the network.
3. **Privacy-Friendly**: Bitcoin TX Accelerate respects your privacy. There’s no need to enter any personal details, and the service doesn’t track you. It’s all about giving you fast results without any unnecessary data collection.

# The Tech Behind the Turbo

While Bitcoin TX Accelerate makes speeding up transactions easy on the outside, there’s some serious technology at work under the hood. Bitcoin TX Accelerate uses advanced fee bumping and strategic transaction optimization, which translates to a faster ride for your transaction through the blockchain.

One key feature is the “Replace-by-Fee” (RBF) option, which lets users increase the transaction fee to boost priority without needing to resend funds. Bitcoin TX Accelerate helps in cases where this option is unavailable, giving your transaction the right nudge to move things along.

# A Real-World Scenario with Bitcoin TX Accelerate

Let’s paint a picture. Imagine you’re grabbing coffee with a friend and need to send over some Bitcoin to cover a quick expense. The transaction seems fine—until you realize that the network is jam-packed, and your confirmation might take hours. With Bitcoin TX Accelerate, you could give it a quick boost, ensuring that by the time you’re sipping the last of your coffee, the transaction has likely confirmed.

Bitcoin TX Accelerate keeps things smooth and stress-free, so you can make payments without worrying about how long it’ll take.

# Bitcoin TX Accelerate: A Few Clicks to a Smoother Ride

Bitcoin’s decentralized nature is powerful, but every superpower has its quirks, and transaction lag is one of them. Fortunately, Bitcoin TX Accelerate is designed with simplicity in mind. Just a few clicks, a dash of tech wizardry, and your transaction gets the boost it needs to fly through the confirmation process.

Here’s a quick refresher on how to use it:

1. **Locate Your Transaction ID**: Find this on your wallet or transaction history.
2. **Head to** [**Bitcoin TX Accelerate**](https://www.txaccelerate.com): Open up the Bitcoin TX Accelerate website.
3. **Enter Your Transaction ID**: Pop it in and submit it.
4. **Sit Back and Relax**: Your transaction will be optimized to confirm faster, no complex steps involved!

Bitcoin TX Accelerate keeps it straightforward. No need to stress over lost confirmations or endless wait times. The tool gives your Bitcoin a jetpack and lets you carry on with your day.

The next time your Bitcoin transaction is dragging, don’t just sit there watching the blockchain crawl. Give Bitcoin TX Accelerate a spin! Whether you’re a trader, merchant, or just an everyday Bitcoin enthusiast, this accelerator is like having a VIP pass in a crowded club.

1gbydab,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1gbydab/please_explain_it_like_im_5_these_capsules_are/,"Please explain it like Im 5, these capsules are confusing. ","I just bought my first nespresso machine, for the original pod line. I was so excited because I love coffee, of many types and styles, and for most of my adult life, but this was my first attempt at home made espresso. It came with a steamer wand something I have also never used before, but steamed milk is an absolute must for a latte (my favorite) so this particular home brewer gave me my best most practical option for making lattes at home with out the inconvenience of an oven. I have more questions than just about the pods but I'll stick to the pods for the purpose of this post. 

I thought it was all espresso but there's so many different labels and it's confusing what it all means. 

First, one of the pods I bought is ""vanilla flavored coffee"" - to me, coffee grounds and espresso grounds are two different sizes, but I'm still brewing it like an espresso, and so little comes out even on the lungo size.... so is it the concentration of coffee or espresso?? 

Second, some of the pods are labeled ""house blend"" vs ""Columbia"" vs ""pikes place roast"" - are these coffees or espressos? I would assume espressos but then I bought another labeled ""blonde espresso roast"" so now Im wondering which it is. 

Third, one specially is labeled ""lungo"" - my maker does either espresso or lungo size brews but many of the pods are labeled for both this one is specifically lungo so does that mean it's really more of a coffee than an espresso? 

Fourth, if I used to order a triple coconut milk latte with blonde roast - would I use three pods of blonde espresso roast pods on the smaller 40 ml espresso setting with my freshly steamed coconut milk? 

Fifth, I bought a ristretto, which I thought was a more concentrated version of espresso but it calls for the same water amount and its the same size pod so Im not sure the difference in these pods versus the ""espresso"" pods.

Last, I bought a three pack of the barista creations by nespresso, the vaniglia, caramello, and cioccolatino which I understand to mean vanilla, caramel and chocolate flavored espresso but is that even right? ",0,1729873692.0,nespresso,6,0.5,False

I've just moved into this apartment and have put my belongings in.

The living room is looking very ""tech"" and I want to give it a cozier vibe. There's a lot of pressure existing wooden fixtures in this house that I can't move. 

PS. I'm also colour blind so any tips on colours to choose would be helpful! I'm having trouble picking the right colours for the sofa cover, coffee table or tv unit etc.

1gbycq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gbycq7/everyone_is_watching_me/,Everyone is watching me,"Hi everyone.

Usually I tend to go to work with public transport. It's safe, fast and convenient as I can work on my laptop in the meantime. Yes - it's crowded, but I don't mind as long as I can sit down and mind my own business.

So lately I've been arguing with myself to improve my travel time. I love listening to music, so why wouldn't I invest in a higher quality headphone? I would say I am a bit old fashioned with my cheap, wired earbuds. So eventually I persuaded myself and decided to buy some expensive wireless headphones with something called noise cancelling. And yes, I know, i found out this technology exists for years. I just never researched it.

I should've done that way earlier as it's amazing. Whenever I travel, I'm completely in my own world. It's somewhat similar to being in a luxurious hotel room. Closed off from everyone else, enjoying the fresh smell of a clean room, the soft linen, the soundproof walls... But something has changed since I got to use these headphones.

As one day I was travelling again to work by train and I decided to just enjoy my new headphones. While I was listening to some music, I was staring outside through the, probably just cleaned, windows. I was watching the beautiful landscapes, farms, little houses as the train went on. As suddenly I felt a strange, tense feeling, as someone was poking his eyes in my neck. As I looked around in the compartment, I couldn't catch anyone watching me. 

It didn't really bug me as this wasn't anything special. Everyone has this feeling sometime. But as I was enjoying my travels, staring outside again, it was right there in the reflection of the window: a man was watching me behind the chairs in front of me. He had a big grin on his face and was watching me persistently. He had a penetrating look in his eyes, it was like he was locked on to me. What a creep, I thought. But, as I stood up to look behind the chair, the man didn't have a big grin on his face. In fact, he wasn't locked onto me; he was locked on his own phone,  doomscrolling tiktok or something.

As I sat down I couldnt believe if what I saw in the window was real or not. I thought about it but I just couldn't care enough about what happend, so I decided to just return to my own 'luxurious hotel room' again.

But on the way back home, the same thing happened again.

I felt this same feeling of being watched. Instead of looking around me, I kept watching my phone and tried to pry around with my eyes to see if I could catch a glimpse of someone watching me. But it wasn't just someone. It was literally everyone in the whole compartment. Everyone had a big grin on their face and was giving me a dead stare, hyperfocused on my, watching all my movements with great interest. It felt insanely tense, like I was hallucinating. As soon as I looked up, everyone turned back to normal and no one was watching me.

I was scared shitless because it happened that morning as well. It feels like everyone was just making a fool out of me. As I was walking home, paying half attention to my phone just to see if it would happen again, I noticed everyone walking by was actually watching. I don't know what they want from me, they never ask me anything, they don't even come closer. They just stare at me with a big grin and eyes.

The last couple of nights the faces of these people stick with me. It's like they are burned in my eyes. The faces are a bit blurred, as I never can catch someones face completely: their face turns normals as soon as I look at them directly. So I haven't really slept anymore: my brain just replays these faces over and over.

It must have been the earbuds, I thought.so I just wouldn't use the noise cancelling earbuds anymore. This morning I went with the train to my work again, because I'm so tired, I fell asleep during the travel for just a brief time. 

I've felt asleep before in the train, but today, Immediately as my eyes closed I felt hands going over my whole body. In my dream I must've been thinking I was getting a massage. The hands felt hot, figuratively and literally. This quickly changed to burning hot. I instantly got shocked awake and saw people their face returning to normal. Meanwhile I still felt the burning hands on my body. As I checked, I noticed I actually got burning marks on my body, exactly on the places where the hands have been during the short moment I was sleeping.

I don't know what is happening. I don't know what to do. I'm at work now, keeping myself awake with as much coffee as possible. I am afraid to ever fall asleep again. What if they know where I live? I'm not superstitious per se, but what if these burning hands are me being dragged down to hell? I must be crazy to even consider that.

I don't even trust anyone reading this anymore, but if anyone knows what to do in my situation, I would consider to act on it.",2,1729873651.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I work very long hours as an EMT in my small town, where shifts can be as long as twelve hours or as short as eight. Most of the time, we work in very small teams and go to tame calls. We almost never get a true dire emergency call; the worst we’ve had was a bad car crash that hospitalized a few people for weeks.

Recently, my partner Rob and I responded to a call from an elderly lady who reported an intruder in her home. When we arrived, 
police were already on the scene.

 They had given her first aid, and we treated her for a minor cut on the back of her head and some bruising on her spine, specifically at C3 and T2.

What struck us as odd was that she had to be restrained during our care because she was frantic, almost appearing to be in a state of distress. 

She was rambling and repeating words under her breath but Rob and I had thrown it up to high stress and adrenaline.
 We couldn’t get her name initially, but the police later found her wallet, identifying her as Martha H. Karol.

Martha didn’t respond to verbal commands and was hunched over in a fetal position. Despite our efforts—me being a 240-pound guy and Rob, who is very strong and built like a brick shit house—we couldn’t get her out of that position. She had abnormal breathing and became increasingly frantic during the ride to the hospital.

Once we arrived, she finally eased up, possibly due to the tension in her muscles from adrenaline or fear. With her finally laid down on the stretcher, we examined her torso for additional bruising.

 When I lifted her shirt, I was shocked by what I saw—dark bruising, almost black in color, covering her body. Rob asked if it could be blood seeping from an organ, but I couldn’t tell; I had never seen bruising like that before, not even during training.

While it was possible she fell during the robbery, the severity of the bruising was alarming. I understand that elderly people have fragile bodies, but this was unlike anything I had encountered.
After checking her into the ER, I was rolling the gurney through the hospital when she suddenly sprang up and grasped my arm tightly.

 It felt like she was holding on for dear life, her grip was so strong that I felt sharp pain as her fingernails dug into my forearm, drawing blood. I tried to pull away, but she felt like an anchor, and it took several nurses and doctors to help me.

Eventually, she released me, and I was rushed into an ER room for immediate medical attention. It took five stitches to repair the damage, along with strong painkillers and anesthetic. I stayed until the next evening to ensure there were no infections or any further injuries that had been done to my arm.

When I was released, Rob was there to take me home. On the drive, he mentioned something odd that made the entire call even more confusing. He said the police report confirmed there was no break-in—no broken glass, no locks picked, and no doors bashed open.

After hearing this, a deep sense of dread settled in. The injuries on the woman couldn’t have been self-inflicted unless she was severely disturbed. When Rob dropped me off, I slumped on my couch, feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about what had just been revealed to me.


For the next few days, I couldn’t go anywhere since everything in town required a drive, and I didn't want to risk getting into an accident with only one functioning hand. So, I spent my time trying to do basic tasks like laundry and cleaning, which turned out to be much harder than I expected. 

Rob occasionally dropped by to check on me whenever he could, considering his work schedule, and sometimes he would bring dinner because cooking with one arm was a challenge. We’d have Chinese takeout and fortune cookies during his visits. 

However, Rob often mentioned how much he disliked getting to my house since it’s secluded, with a dirt driveway full of potholes from constant rain. Driving there at night, or even at dusk, required careful navigation.

For the next couple of weeks, I went to the hospital for check-ups to ensure my arm was healing. The doctor said it would take more time before it fully healed, and even longer before I regained any feeling in my hand.

 That night, I took a shower, and as the warm water washed over me, I couldn’t feel anything in my arm. Then, something strange happened. As I shut off the water through the steam, I noticed my shadow lagging behind my movements by a split second.

 I waved my hand, but both my hand and body seemed to lag. I felt like I was going crazy, but after slowly waving my hand for a while, I realized I was just sleep-deprived and loopy from the painkillers the hospital gave me. I went to bed, trying to push the strange experience out of my mind.

At around 3:45 in the morning, I woke up and went to the kitchen for a glass of water, something I often did since waking up in the middle of the night was a regular occurrence for me. As I poured the water, I saw something out of the corner of my eye.

Living alone and in such a secluded area, there shouldn’t have been anyone there, but I swore I saw a person walk from the hallway into the laundry room.

 I almost dropped the glass in shock. Trying to stay quiet, I set the water down and crept back to my bedroom.

 I quickly grabbed my Glock 34 from my desk drawer and, with only one functioning arm, managed to load a round into the chamber. Crouching in the darkness with my gun in hand, I hid behind the kitchen counter, aiming at the hallway, expecting someone to appear.

After what felt like hours but was probably only five minutes, no one emerged. I cautiously got up, approached the hallway, and started clearing each room. My heart pounded as I expected someone to jump out at me at any moment, but there was no one. 

I searched every room, but there was no sign of an intruder—no broken glass, no muddy footprints. I started to question everything. The window where I thought I saw the person was on the second floor, so how could anyone have gotten in? 

I began to feel paranoid and frantic, turning on all the lights and going over every room multiple times. I checked every window and door—no windows were broken, no locks picked, and no doors bashed in. It didn’t make sense.

 I was sure I had seen someone, it felt too real. But deep down, I knew it was probably the sleep deprivation and painkillers messing with my mind. I found myself talking out loud in the living room, still clutching my gun, feeling like I was going insane.

After what had happened that night I always made sure to go over not once but twice so that all the windows and doors were locked like always. But I had to make sure that they were locked for certain, I couldn’t risk whatever happened that night to happen again.


 After a few days I went on about my life doing chores around the house but I couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was always behind me just waiting for me to relax and somehow slipup.

 I became so much more paranoid, I never have been a true believer in stuff like aliens and anything that couldn’t be explained hell I never even believed in the paranormal or ghosts I always thought it was just a load of bs and that everything that you saw on the internet had to have been somehow faked or staged.

But after a metric ton of thinking I couldn’t just chalk what had happened that night up to some painkillers and being sleepy for God’s sake. Like I said I don’t believe in the paranormal but as I got up to go inside I noticed that I had no shadow. 

I jumped at the sight and I pranced around almost dancing in a sense as I admired on how weird it was that I had no shadow it practically stopped following me and I thought that for a while that I was a vampire of some sorts but I came to reality as of what happened in the shower and that night of what I saw.  

There was definitely something going on around here, that there had to have been something more to this than what I initially led on to—there just had to be. 

I went to bed that night and locked my bedroom door and in my room, keeping the handgun right by my side on the nightstand this time in case anything happened.
 But nothing did happen that night, and the next night, and the night after that, even during the day nothing had happened.

I awoke one morning to a seemingly beautiful day, with the sun peeking through the trees and blinds, and the sound of birds chirping nearby. 
It felt like I was in the middle of a dream. I threw on some music and happily made some half-burnt eggs and bacon, struggling to flip them properly with one hand.

 I ate on my porch, basking in the sunlight as I read the news. But then I noticed my phone wasn’t working nor would it turn on either, and that’s when I was dragged out of that peaceful reality and sucked back into my own. It wasn’t real and I realized it was indeed a dream, a dream that didn’t last, I awoke in my room to a total darkness that engulfed my room.

It was dark, too-dark to even see in my own room. The only thing illuminating the space was my alarm clock with the red numbers that read 3:45 again?, exactly like before. As I gathered my senses, I heard the hard rain hitting the window.

 A devilish storm had broken out in the middle of the night, and I was caught in it. There had been no forecast of a storm the night before, but then again our town didn’t have the world’s best weather station either.

 “Jesus Christ,”

I muttered out loud as I watched the rain and occasional lightning illuminate the pitch-black sky, revealing ominous dark clouds.
With the dim moonlight coming through my bedroom windows and the bright flashes of lightning flooding the house, 

I noticed something odd. A huge feeling of uncertainty washed over me, and dread filled my lungs and heart and I felt as though I was almost drowning in it.
 I couldn’t make out what it was, but as the feeling grew, I spun around, scanning my room for anything suspicious.

 Subconsciously, I reached for my gun but stopped myself when I neither heard nor saw anything out of place, that’s when I noticed in the moonlight I had no shadow again.

“Jesus Christ,” 

I suddenly heard in a distorted voice, twisted in a range of unsettling vocals. 

I looked down at the foot of my bed to see a matte black, grotesque version of a human. Half of its body was sticking out from under the bed, the other half hidden covered by the rest of my bed. I screamed louder than I’d ever screamed before, terrifying myself on top of the horror I was witnessing. It said 

“Jesus Christ” 

again, this time deeper, darker, with more gravel in its voice and louder. 

I collapsed onto the floor, scrambling away as the creature slithered back under the bed.
As I crawled toward the bedroom door, and as I realized to my horror, that I had left the gun on the nightstand.
 
God damn it”

 I cursed myself. Reaching for the light switch, I flipped it on, but as I stood up, I noticed a sharp pain in my ankle. It had been slit open. With blood rushing out of the slit ankle and the skin with an almost razor sharp cut. I collapsed to the floor again, and when I looked back, all I could see were two yellowish-brown eyes staring at me from under the bed.

“GoD DaMnIt,”

 The creature mimicked my words, its voice jagged and unnatural. Fear overwhelmed me, as if someone had lit me on fire. I sat up and desperately tried to open the door, but it wouldn’t budge. 

By now, I was crying due to whatever was under my bed mimicking my words. Trying frantically to get the door open while glancing over my shoulder to see if the creature was coming after me.

After several attempts, the door finally gave way. I practically crawled out of the room, screaming and sobbing, slamming the door behind me.

 But as I closed the door, I got one last look at the creature. It was still watching me from under the bed, fixated solely on me, tracking my every move like a predator stalking its prey.



As I crawled out of my room while bleeding soaking my wooden floor with my own blood turning the once oak stairs to a dark red and covering myself in the same pool of it I got up to my feet and finally was able to at least hop, to my kitchen where I kept a first aid box. 

I threw it open spilling some of the contents on the floor and getting some of it soaked in the blood that turned some of the gauze from snow white to red the cut must have slit the artery above the ankle.

 I threw on a tourniquet and with all my might I tightened down the strap and then forcefully and painfully I don’t want to admit it but I shed tears, as I bore down as I turned the windlass until I couldn’t anymore with all my might almost blacking out in the process. 

The bleeding eventually slowed down and I was able to quickly patch up the wound and wrap it with gauze and bandage and treated it with some disinfectant. 

It wasn’t perfect but it was what I had and it would have to do for now. It still hurt like a son of a bitch (obviously I thought to myself) I could hear whatever the hell was in my room stirring awake now and was still in my room and it was starting to move and I don’t think it was coming to give fucking hugs either.
 The boards of the house cracked and groaned so whatever was in there wasn’t light by any means. 

My keys to my car were in the room as well, so there wasn’t any escaping unless I wanted to limp for five miles and possibly get my wound infected and die in the cold and rain along the way. I grabbed a flashlight as I made my way to the downstairs of my house, as I was going to try and hide from it.

 I limped my way down the stairs and into the bottom part of my house and I made sure to not turn on the lights as I didn't give away my hiding spot. I settled on hiding in the guest bedroom, locking the door behind me and turning on my flashlight.

 I sat there listening to whatever the hell was in my room move around and groan with a freakish noise as it moved around the house. It tried to speak a few times but it just repeated the same phrase saying
 
“God damnit”... “God damnit” 

In this things fucked up voice in almost a whisper and shout at the same time, it reverbed throughout the house bouncing off all the walls and windows and into the bedroom I was hiding in. 

What went from heavy sounds of footsteps as if someone was marching around to what I can only describe as wet mushy clomps hitting the floor and almost sounded like if you were taking the insides of a watermelon and a pumpkin and squishing them with your bare hands.

 I was shaking with fear paralyzed by it. I couldn’t move either. This was the most scared I had ever been and he could feel it. 

The realization of not knowing what to do sat with me as I heard this thing roar and roam around the house for hours as I hid in my house quietly crying in the corner from what he concluded was a shadow hunting me.
 After it went quiet in the house I decided to muster up whatever courage I had left and I was going to try and escape from this hellish nightmare. I’ve been through worse than this and this wasn’t going to be my story's end, I wasn’t going to die to a monster from hell. 

So with all the bravery in my heart I stood up and limped my way over to the door and cracked it open to see whatever was out there still.
 
It stared right at me,

 it had turned into a ball of flesh and bones. It had no more facial features, all of it’s matte black color was stripped and replaced with white skin and eyes that looked like they were torn out of somebody’s face. 

There were bones where there shouldn’t, couldn’t have been bones, the ulna was lodged into it’s ribcage so the arm was just a tube of flesh,
 the rib cage itself was facing out the back and had been flipped around and was sticking out halfway of it’s body.

 I flung myself back into the bedroom once more, the ball of flesh burst open the door and was screaming at me like a child having a temper tantrum. 

“WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME”

 I screamed at the top of my lungs, feeling like I was going to lose my voice in the process. The ball of flesh, bone, and hair responded to me,
 
“What do you want from me?”

 I almost vomited at the sound of hearing it spit back the question at me
 then I quickly swallowed it, as it regurgitated my words back to me. 
The flesh that was dripping and falling off this thing's body like if you left ice cream out for too long was ever so slightly inching towards me as I tried to hold my flashlight in hand shaking with fear. 

I noticed I had pissed myself in fear as the wetness from my boxers leaked onto the floor, 

“Jesus Christ” 

the thing gurgled and mocked me that I had pissed myself and I wasn’t going to allow it. I got up and without a care for my bloody ankle I charged at this hellish beast and I was going to kill it but that didn’t happen.

 It opened its mouth that had been carved from ear to ear, the teeth that looked like they came out of a mix of a T.rex and a hippo. Where I ran and jumped was directly aimed at the beast’s mouth.
I tried to move out of the way but it was to no use, it’s teeth clenched and I was caught in them, 

I screamed and thrashed around with one-half of my body in it blood spurting everywhere as I tried to break free but it was no use, the teeth yet again bore down on my shoulder, tightening even more with somehow even more force this time. My flesh split in two as the teeth tore it apart from fat to muscle fibers. It didn't care as it chewed its way into me.

 Then it let go, for whatever reason it had released me from its death grip in its mouth and yet again stared at me only this time I could see the silhouette of it because I had dropped my flashlight in the corner when it attacked me. 

The creature yet again lurched forward and hit me right on top of the head. I then awoke in a chair not bound but in a chair. With the sun beginning to rise and the forest outside my house starting to lighten up the night sky into a bluish haze. 

I awoke in my living room with my laptop sitting in front of me. Was it all a dream? I very quietly said to myself in the chair. 

“No” 

What I thought had been a dream was a nightmarish reality with the feeling starting to kick back in my shoulder as I looked over to see it torn in two with the shoulder cap being exposed even and with every breath I took my lung pushing out a piece of flesh from inside my chest.

 I tried to look around, but I couldn’t move as I felt disabled sitting there. I noticed in the corner of the living the vile creature still with all of its grotesque features like a teratoma had exploded and had features that of a human and could speak. 

After a minute or two the creature then shifted in the corner but it didn’t move itself, it was moving from the inside and it was trying to molt. First, a hand poked the belly of the beast and then a leg and then the face of something. 

Eventually, it exploded out of the bile creature's belly and it sent chunks of flesh and intestines everywhere coating the walls in a sludge full of meat and bone fragments. The creature that came out had evolved a very human-like appearance almost like me…… 

The realization hit me like a freight train. Everything from its body, tallness, and even skin, had been replicated down to my exact measurements and looks. It slowly walked over to me and put its blood-covered hand on the side of my face, I threw up and projectile vomited all over myself as myself patted me on the head and tried to speak to me in its broken English tongue 

“It’s okay just relax”

 I tried to shake what were my own hands off of me but it was to no use as my neck, spine, and skull cracked and popped violently, with every move I tried to make. I thrashed around on my office chair with me behind me but as soon as I felt my doppelgängers fingers turn from their hard chiseled hands to sharp and razor claws, I heard my phone ring.
 
It was Rob he was calling to check in on me to see how I was holding up. The beast growled in disappointment, I guess it wasn’t a fan of Rob for whatever reason. 

The creature stared at my phone until it went silent, then it rang again. Rob never was one to just call once, especially in this case where he was giving me a checkup call. Call after call eventually became text after text and the time between them shortened.

My mutilated doppelgänger wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon, and seeing that Rob was now on his way, it seemed like my only way out of this nightmare. The creature turned me around in my office chair of death, “You know there’s no way out of this right?” I spat in its face letting it know that I had made up my mind even if I did make it out of here or not. 

 As I sat there clinging on to life, awaiting the release of death whether it would be from the blood loss, or the creature that was now growing in the corner, doing God knows what. I heard the indistinguishable noise of Rob’s brakes arriving at the front of the house.

 My body jolted alive once more, with every ounce and microgram of strength I had left within my dying body, I tried to yell for help but all that came out was a shy cry of a whisper for help.

 I could hear Rob call for me from his car, expecting me to walk out of the front door I did. But it wasn’t me, my doppelganger was walking out of the front door to go and do god knows what to Rob.
 But nothing did happen, as I heard the two of them talking outside the mimic perfectly copying my voice. 

But I heard something that gave me a chance for survival. Rob had asked what happened to my arm and that he didn’t see any stitches. My mimic asked him to come inside and he’ll show him what happened. 

“NO DON’T COME INSIDE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON’T DO IT”

 But my screams of silence were to no use as there was no hope as I saw my  appear in the doorway without a shadow no less and then harshly swing open the front door walking in smiling at me from ear to ear, like a kid on Christmas day. 

Rob followed closely behind my mimic and what turned into a smile of him expecting to sit down and enjoy some nice hot coffee after a long night on the job, turned into a revolting disgust, as he froze in the doorway and dropped to his knees. Rob saw me sitting there half slumped in my chair wheezing for air, caked in blood mixed in with the green vile vomit and waste and with bits of entrails and skin all over me, covering me from head to toe. 

Rob sat there on his knees, in silence taking in the sight of me as I layed there. He slowly got up and shifted over to me closely examining me. I guess he couldn’t really tell if it was me or not with all the grotesque fluids and solids on me. 

“Marcus? Is that you?” 

Rob asked in a shivering sheepish voice almost shedding tears. All I could do was slightly nod confirming his suspicion, the only thing he could see was the whites of my eyes behind the thick curtain of blood covering the rest of my facial features. 

Rob reached out to me but a firm hand was then placed on his shoulder. It was my mimic’s hand or more or less my hand, the hand in whole, tightly gripped Rob’s shoulder pressing against his blue cotton shirt that he was wearing for his shift that night.

The single hand then became two and then flung Rob across the living room floor, and he came down with a violent crash putting a massive hole into the wall where his torso hit. Rob groaned with pain as he got up, but my mimic was too fast for him as he basically teleported to him from where I was sitting. 

Before Rob could even get a chance to try and defend himself the mimic grabbed him from the front of his collar like if you grabbed a puppy from his scruff and opened his freakishly large mouth. Saliva and mucus dripped and poured over the sides of the creatures mouth.

It’s teeth pointy like a doctor’s needle, his tongue was too long for his mouth so it laid out the side of his face. The roof of his mouth and not yet fully developed so all that was there in replacement was fibers and muscles that didn’t fully cover it and left gaps that looked almost like the inside of fish gills.
The mimic was about to clamp down on Rob and leave a bloody mess of his head.

“WAIT!”

I had mustered up enough of my breath to say that. The mimic then froze as he was holding Rob in the air. He dropped Rob from his future demise and closed his demonic mouth.

“What? What could you possibly want now in your final moments?”

“How does the taste of lead feel motherfucker”

Rob then pointed his 45. That he had grabbed from his waistband and unloaded a full magazine into the body of the creature.
 
The bullets Rob had fired went straight through the creature’s torso, and a couple through his head. It screamed with an ear deafening screech which left my ears ringing and almost deaf. The creature slumped and bent half way over and collapsed to the ground.

Rob ran over to me, in a hurry panic with a state of shock on his face. He grabbed without a question and slung me over his back. As he was carrying me out of the doorway I heard the creature move.

Rob hurriedly put me in the passenger seat of his car and started it. I looked only with my eyes as my neck was still in serious pain to see the mimic standing in the doorway. Rob also noticed and loaded another mag into his sidearm and let loose another 7 bullets.

Most of them hit, the ones that did hit the monster and parts of flesh ejected from it. A part of the left torso had completely blown off, not due to the bullets but because of the mimic. It knelt down and started ejecting even more of its skin.

 It looked like it was ejecting plates or skin armor, what was underneath was an amalgamation of red muscle like if you skinned a human alive and took away the base layer. Smooth dark red muscle moving in unison around the body. Rob hopped back into the car not even wanting to look at was growing on my doorstep. 

What happened after that I can’t remember as I was either blacked out due to the blood loss I sustained or just unconscious and on the brink of death. But luckily for me according to Rob, he ignored every traffic light and sign in order to get me to the hospital. 

So as I am writing this and having to recount all the horrific details of what demonic activity sprung in my house all I have to say is. 

If you’re shadow stops following you

Please don’t ignore it.

I’m currently take 1mg guanfacine and 40mg Vyvanse, and it’s awful. If I take the guanfacine in the morning, I’m too tired to do anything and I get horrible sniffles. If I take it at night I have severe anxiety throughout the day. I know coffee makes this worse but I can barely stay awake without it despite the stimulants. 

I haven’t been able to make food that requires more effort than turning on a microwave.  I have no focus still. The worst part is that Vyvanse used to help a little, but I haven’t had decent results from it in months. 

It’s been about 10 days. Do I power through and just hope the guanfacine side effects go away?  

Also small edit for common things I’ve seen in replies of similar posts:
- I am not autistic but do have other issues and am trying to work on finding a combination that addresses those. Nothing has worked. 
- I would love to eat a better breakfast when I take meds, but I don’t have the energy to cook anymore.

1gby5sj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gby5sj,Help with our living room!!,"Sooo actually this is our living room/playroom/WFH office 😅 We have three girls, including baby twins.

1st question: we're removing the right desk (the wooden one). But not sure what we could use the space for since it's behind the couch? Or should we change the layout entirely? (White doors on the TV all are storage. The chair and the black desk are HUGE, they don't fit on another wall.)

(We're not buying big furniture bc changing home in one year. Maybe cheap Ikea style. We do have in storage a white Ikea Billy library and a big grey buffet, that came with the tv stand and coffee table.

2nd question: I would like to put some art on the big white wall. But what? Family pictures? (We do have very nice ones from a professional photographer). A big one centered, or two medium sized, or many small?? Which dominating colors? Or rather a bought artwork? I'm lost at this!!! (Ceiling is very high.)

With 3 kids I'm not looking for tips to have the room look Instagram worthy, but rather comfy, easy to tidy up and clean. Taking any suggestions!! Thanks for your help 🙏🙏🙏 and please don't be too harsh about the mess, we're doing our best 😅",2,1729873166.0,HomeDecorating,7,0.75,False
1gby370,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/1gby370/6_years_ago/,6 Years Ago,"6 years ago today was a day unlike anything I could have ever anticipated. It started like all days did, I woke up, bathed, had a coffee and worked from home, it would have , by all accounts , been an entirely normal morning, and it was up until the point where my memory turned off. What was to follow would be a nightmare for those who remember what the next days would entail; I was spared such memories, I am not sure if that is a blessing or a curse. I woke up to a world where words like “stroke” and “hemorrhage” were being thrown around without context; or so I thought. It turns out that it wasn’t that these words were in fact being used correctly, rather,  it was me who was not able to understand what was going on. I opened my eyes to a world of confusion, distress and far too little apple juice. 6 years ago today my life came to an end…. And a new one was born.

I post about my stroke once a year on the anniversary of the not so blessed day. This will be my third post for  anyone who is interested the other 2 were

4 Years Ago
https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/s/hc0EPZ0MaV

5 Years Ago
https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/s/g89AtHa9xd

I am writing this post a few days before the anniversary of my stroke because, for me, I find the actual day to be difficult.  The dichotomy between being a survivor and being the old me is something I deal with daily and it is magnified on the days leading up to and on the day of the stroke anniversary.  As I write this I am continuously telling myself that 6 years ago, at this moment, i was a better version of who I am now.  I know that is not necessarily true, but in this moment, at this time it is all I can think about.  Writing this is tough as I am generally the person who wants to celebrate all of the small victories that I (and you) claw back from stroke,  but right now it is a struggle to be that person. And that’s all right.  We all come here for various reasons, sometimes we are looking for answers, other times it’s for support.  Occasionally, and too rare by far it’s to celebrate our wins.  Alas, there a moments when we want to vent, to rage against something that we couldn’t control, with people who might understand what it really feels like.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with feeling down.  Stroke took something from us and I think it’s totally normal to be upset about it.. as long as it is temporary.  I know that I am sad right now, I can understand why I feel this way and I am ok with it.  I think I will always grieve for what was lost, and again, that is ok.  I say this because I know I will feel better eventually. And if I don’t, if I am stuck in this head space I know how to ask for help. I give myself the latitude to feel the loss instead of trying to tell myself I am fine. As I write this I know I am not ok, but I will be soon.

6 years in I no longer try to relive the who I may have been before the stroke, but that does not mean I don’t miss the parts of me that were stolen away.  Every time I get confused, lost or need to take a “time out” I am reminded that I am different.  That 6 years ago minus a day (some) things were better.  It is something I, and we, will need to live with.  I would like to say that everything gets better with time.  A lot of things do, but for me, while I obsess about it less, there are times when it still hurts.

I am a 6 year survivor of something where I was lucky to last the first night.  I have survived multiple surgical forays into my brain, I have crushed my rehabilitation program and miraculously survived months of hospital food.  I have surpassed all of the expectations that my medical team, family and myself placed on me.  I am all that, and today I am sad, angry and in mourning, and that is okay.  Next week I will psyche myself up and get back to kicking strokes ass… while enjoying a nice glass of apple juice.

As always, ask for help if you need it and caregivers are awesome.",14,1729872987.0,stroke,2,1.0,False
