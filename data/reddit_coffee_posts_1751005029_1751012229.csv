1llogwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabrowser/comments/1llogwn/love_tailing_defines_intent_for_chat_vs_search/,"LOVE: Tailing ""?"" defines intent for chat vs search || HATE: Please add Cmd + z support! 😭","The good  
Everything is great, and for an early-release product Dia is indeed so refined.   
One of the quirky features I LOVE so far is adding a tailing ""?""  to a new tab prompt affects on if it's gonna be a chat query or a your-default-search-engine query. I heavily use it and now that I've gotten used to it, I cannot go back to Arc ( been a long-time user of Arc). It's something novel and more emphasised, kind of a signature ""The Browser Company"" style feature: quirky, cheekily smart and undeniably elegant. Stuff like this would make an end developer-genre user like me stick and gain affinity for choosing Dia over other AI browsers definitively.   


The bad

The bad is I hate that Cmd + Z doesn't work, like that would literally make life so much easier. And I'm a heavy keyboard user, so I just spam Cmd + W often to clear like 20 consecutive tabs that are just docs of some libs on and on, and I'm done with what I wanted now. Happens often I just abuse Cmd + W and purge tabs I need accidentally, and I immediately hate that I have to now question myself if the tab was worth the trouble of doing a quick 5-click routine to open it back up from history, or just let it be. And it happens a lot more than you can imagine. I largely believe that's a silver lining because navigation and browsing, discovering, scanning information is definitely much faster now with Dia. I've always been a never-have-too-many-tabs-open guy but I find myself doing that with Dia quite often, because Dia allows me to just navigate through information, hierarchical stuff like docs as well, like a vague mind map. Hence I open a lot of tabs, switch tabs around with keyboard, scan everything, keep spamming open new tabs and deleting ones I'm on or have scanned. This goes on till I find what I want and then just purge all tabs related to this chain of thought. It's a small left-out feature, and there are much better novel ones added in that I like. Just feels anti-pattern and hate that something tiny affects my work quite a lot.

The ugly  
There are a lot of CUA-agents based task/browser/automation products and ventures rapidly iterating in the past few months, and end of the day it's AI that's the backbone for everything.   
Among few major differentiators that remain for AI products competing in the same market-fit space, is just great design that empowers efficiency. All AI products have AI inherently and we should get used to it not being a ""wow"" factor anymore, in fact I believe that has already started to wane among non-tech tech-savy individuals (like say your younger brother in school, who uses a ton of different assistants already, albeit doesn't necessarily code at a high level) to the people in the tech-space.   
  
However everyone competes to develop more efficient implementations of AI for their use-cases, makes me picture a very heavily iterating future in the tech space, however as efficiency, cost/speed/time demand of iterating on products keeps getting exponentially lower, people also believe in 50 years perhaps we can all just make whatever we want on-demand by speaking to an all-governing AI, which just raw-dogs and builds you Stripe in 5 secs of beastly compute time, because you don't want to ""install"" a third-party software on your ecosystem to dish out cash at your local McDonald's? Get into newsletters, trackers, all that stuff? Why,  it's just ""ew"" at that point. Why ""install"" anything, unless you're dependant on the third party would be the case. I ask, where is the limit? A Goverment-regulated AGI would have access to public banking APIs, with right security routines in place. You might as well ask it to make your Google-Pay Clone star-wars theme while you're at it, cos why not!? We do love custom wallets.    


[A custom wallet.](https://preview.redd.it/15ftpnmsdf9f1.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=0642ef1b09d5d7b93e23ee9dd9ec29d4b492323d)



AI keeps getting more hardcore at doing stuff and I just believe its creating in a huge communication gap between the work we produce and the thought we put into it. AI in few years iterates beastly on everything and well who says it's just one. Perhaps you can build a fleet of few AI agents for yourself and then they're 10 AIs communicating, processing, iterating information where each one is already doing it 10x faster than an avg human. So the ratio drops to 1:100 real quick, and this is like in less than 5 years.   
Scaling goes infinite theoretically, but I believe what DEFINES a ""better"" AI product when two are compared in the same use-case, is ""How much faster, can you convey to-and-fro, users chain-of-thought and intents, real-time, than X, and act upon it to user's satisfaction."". Perhaps it's better design, perhaps it's keyboard shortcuts (also design but can't think of better examples). When I leave my copilot running iterating on some tasks I give it, and go make coffee, I'm largely worried that it'll go astray and do something that I have to spend time undoing. There's that loss in communication. And why can't I rely on my intent to reflect as is on what the AI produces there? I feel a constant need for supervision, because I know it will go astray 1 out of 10 times, I've seen it happen. I feel there needs to be better ways and AI products are getting norm, everyone just strapping in a chat which does stuff user can do directly, but now they can avoid. Well literally everything has that now, and increasingly expensive design language as X in series-X funding goes up. I'm just frustrated because many AI startups build for a use-case, but do not consider to put more effort into tailoring it to the use-case. I believe there's two major differentiators - offerings and novelty with communication/implementation speed. A customer might go to another competitor because they have more features, more third-party tools support, etc. But if you don't work on that, it still doesn't mean the life is easy for competitor because someone else will definitely given enough time. We get it AI is here it's awesome. What would truly be stellar is if my intents can be mapped to the actionables better, and if communication was made seamless for revisions. I cannot type in a chat 10 times to correct. AI products in my opinion are yet to discover the sweet-balance between intent, actionables, and being in sync with user's chain of thought. I do understand that we can't have neuralinks yet, and people just feel what else can be improved in a chat. Or to make it faster, voice-chat. On a non-tech consumer level feels like I take 1 step to guide 10 steps for AI to get something done, which is cool, because I know I'll be the same guy frustrated if I have to tell it 10 times the next step. As a dev, when I abuse LLMs and do multi agent setup, this disparity goes higher. The only reason I've always loved Browser Co is because it's about doing what user needs to do, but tailored and better. I've myself been inspired from many Arc features in personal projects, and it has been one of my references when I think of design language while ideating a product. I hope Dia is not rushed. I hope the design language doesn't change. It speaks of a priority towards working on tailoring to users intents and I feel that is the best one for this AI wave, and browser Co is already aligned towards this, have great experience in this as well. I hope future AI products work better on reducing the communication gap, and not shy away from snappy robust revision-heavy interfaces. If more revisions mean better faster outputs for our intents, we'd all love that. What we hate is the repetative-effort that comes along. Revisions should be seamless and I am very confident any AI product where revisions are a breeze and something a user can perform at a high frequency (>15 a min atleast to begin with, since there are none yet lol). If that can be achieved without requiring being a pain for the users, it would be a truly novel AI product.",1,1751012014.0,diabrowser,0,1.0,False

1llogho,https://i.redd.it/0izwp5uwff9f1.jpeg,Budan One Touch Coffee Machine – Capsule Convenience Meets Ground Coffee Drama,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a detailed review of the **Budan One Touch Coffee Machine**, which I’ve been using almost daily for the past few weeks. It’s one of the more affordable options in the Indian market that offers **both capsule and ground coffee compatibility**, and I went in hoping for a decent everyday machine. Spoiler: it delivers in some areas and absolutely makes you work for it in others. Here's everything I’ve found.

**For full transparency:** this demo unit was sent to me on loan by Something’s Brewing to test and film with. I’ve been using it extensively with both capsules and ground coffee, and what follows is my honest, no-hype review after genuinely trying to live with it like any regular home coffee brewer would.

First off, the biggest reason I picked this machine up was its dual functionality — the fact that you can use capsules *AND* ground coffee. On busy days, popping in a pod is super convenient and surprisingly satisfying (the little ASMR moment of it locking in and the needle poking through is weirdly enjoyable). The capsule side of things is genuinely great. You insert the pod, it does its thing, and you get a solid cup of coffee. There’s very little mess, and very little post-brew maintenance.

Now the **ground coffee mode**, while useful, comes with drama. There’s a plastic tamper included, it’s light and a bit flimsy, but functional. The real issue is pressure. Sometimes when I use the ground coffee attachment, the brew starts with a *bang*. Like, pressure builds up and shoots coffee backward, and I end up wiping down the back panel every single time. It’s not broken, just kind of chaotic. And once you’re done, the cleanup is more involved because the wet puck doesn’t separate cleanly. You’re stuck wondering if you should dump it in the bin (too wet) or the sink (too chunky). Either way, your counter will probably get involved.

There’s also a milk frother attachment, which feels like an afterthought. It technically works, but it’s a bit of a hassle. Cleaning milk residue from tiny plastic tubing is not my idea of a fun post-coffee ritual. I honestly recommend skipping this for daily use and just heating your milk on the stove or microwave — way faster and way less maintenance.

In terms of usability, the machine has three modes: a one-cup shot, a two-cup shot, and a milk-based drink option that only activates if the milk pod is attached. I actually appreciated that: the UI is smart enough to hide the third option when it’s not relevant. The water tank is on the smaller side, good for about 5–6 cups max, so I usually refill it every two days. I also make a habit of changing the water regularly to avoid that stale-tank smell that some machines develop over time.

The machine is priced around ₹14,000–15,000, and to be honest, I’m okay with it breaking down in 2–3 years given the value it’s already providing. It’s not industrial-grade, but for a home setup that saves you a café run every day, it does its job. Especially if you're primarily using it for capsules. That’s the sweet spot. Ground coffee should really be treated as an *occasional feature*, not the main way you use this machine. And the milk frother? Let’s call it a bonus feature you use on long weekends, not Monday mornings.

So, **who is this machine for?** If you're someone who just wants a good cup of coffee in 2 minutes flat, without standing over a kettle and weighing beans like you're about to launch a rocket — this is for you. If you don’t mind spending ₹60–₹80 a day on a capsule, and you like the idea of being your own barista *without* becoming a cleaning technician, you’ll be happy. It’s definitely not for someone who wants full control over extraction, bloom, and ratios. It’s for the everyday coffee lover who wants something better than instant, but not as demanding as a full espresso setup.

Now about the **discount code**: I am affiliate with SB and I do have a **10% off code for Something’s Brewing** which works on *all* their products (not just this machine). But I can’t share it publicly here since it includes my real name. If you're interested, just **DM me** and I’ll happily send it over.

Hope this helps someone deciding between coffee machines in India. If you’ve used this or any other similar machine, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Always fun to nerd out over our caffeine tools ☕️",1,1751011964.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

1llogdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1llogdx/aita_boyfriend_calls_his_ex_cute_names/,AITA boyfriend calls his ex cute names,"**Hello wise souls of Reddit,**

Back in October, I started dating my boyfriend, and our relationship became official in April. He is still in contact with his ex-girlfriend and occasionally meets up with her. While I’m not thrilled about it, I’ve accepted it.

What I *haven’t* been able to accept, however, is that he still calls her the pet name they created during their relationship—something like “honey,” but a personalized nickname just between the two of them.

I told him how much this bothered me, and he promised he would stop using it. A few weeks later, I had a gut feeling he wasn’t keeping that promise. I know I shouldn’t have done this, but I checked his phone—and sure enough, he was still using the nickname.

We had a major fallout. He was furious that I went through his phone, and I was furious that he broke his promise about something that is really sensitive to me. At this point, I’m struggling to trust his words. This was the *third* time something like this happened. I forgave him the first two times, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to move past it.

He insists the nickname is just a habit now and that it doesn’t hold any meaning for him anymore. That it just slipped into the conversation without him thinking. He says he loves me, wants a future with me, and that I’m the one for him. And honestly, I don’t believe he’s cheating—he only sees her in public places for coffee or lunch.

We’ve now made a new agreement: he can only meet her once a month, and he’ll show me their WhatsApp conversations weekly. I don’t like being controlling, and I don’t *want* to check his messages—I want to trust him completely. This arrangement isn’t about surveillance, but rather about him showing that he’s willing to rebuild trust and follow through this time.

So here’s my question: **Am I overreacting?**

Aside from this issue, our relationship is everything I’ve ever wanted. He’s kind, attentive, emotionally supportive, picks up on even small changes in my mood, and is overall loving and loyal. But this nickname thing keeps gnawing at me.

Can it really be *that* insignificant to him, even though he knows how much it hurts me?",1,1751011950.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

i am watching myself be mediocre.

  


i feel i cannot compare to anyone. every instagram creator is a genius with a million talents and a huge (well-deserved) following. everyone’s a beautiful genius.

  


i feel behind.  i don’t care. i do care so much.  i can’t stand it. i must stand it.  i have no hope. i have just enough hope.  i don’t know what to do.

  


if i want to be great, i’m already wanting the wrong thing. the people who do best are driven organically.  and even beyond them, the people who are indeed driven by the desire for fame or success or money, they are more driven than i am, more dedicated and disciplined and talented and powerful and beautiful and kind and everything else.

  


any talent i have is a pathetic little thing to hold onto, and hold onto it i do.  my talents are like little chunks of unpolished gold that i keep in some safe in a closet, and once in a while i check in on them and hold them and think how rich i am and how rich i could be if i were to somehow invest or multiply those gold nuggets. meanwhile, people with no gold are working to acquire it. and people with real wealth, real gold, are growing their stash.  and i want to be either of those people.  back on the other side of the analogy: i idolize my own talents, i zoom in on them and magnify them and self-worship in the most sickening way when i feel as though my talents are real.  i’m not doing the dynamic justice right now because i’m a mediocre writer. but perfect example – take writing. i’ll be like “actually i’m a genius writer. i just haven’t tried to apply myself at it because i don’t want to” which is obviously like a trope but i really mean it.  i’m absolutely obsessed with my little fledgling, useless talents, and with myself overall, but i absolutely hate myself and recognize that i bring absolutely nothing to the table. i  guess nowadays they would call it narcissism. but it doesn’t matter what it’s called, i want to be free of it.whatever. now i don’t even care. not that i don’t care but i thought about “just be grateful” and i am grateful and i like sun and coffee and water and food and women and video games and tv and stuff and i’ve been trying to pray and to make sure i express gratitude to god during those prayers even if part of me thinks i’m not really talking to anybody or anything when i do so, and that i’m just playing out a sort of performative self-delusional humility-porn (not humiliation, humility) for myself to jack off to—like, “look at me, praying—so humble, so folksy, so trusting in the universe, so not-above-unscientific-stuff— i’m not one of these dumb atheists who takes action and doesn’t believe in miracles and shit.  no, i’m praying.  aren’t i such a good pious boy, God?\*   \*just in case you are listening.  but i mean it is a true belief to a degree; i can’t really shake the belief in god because it seems metaphysically necessary and idk it’s just retarded to think otherwise.  but it’s still empty.  it’s like……..what is it like………………………………………. like writing a journal entry that someone might someday read.  like, if you look down the chain of — fuck it, doesn’t matter, neutered the thought by the thought of publishing it.  
———but anyway, it’s an empty faith/belief.   nothing godly ever happens

  


everybody’s exceptional except the unexceptional people. and i’m one of those unexceptional people. my life is fuckin gay. but im also incredibly lucky. theres that thing where its like “youre expecting your life to start with the idyllic vision of it ‘really starting’ at some imaginary future point but it’s actually happening now and you’ll only realize it’s over when it’s over” and i hear that and my heart jumps and i think “FUCK! I KNOW! but what do i do?!?!?!?!?!?” WHAT DO I DO!??!?!? IF THERE WAS A POOL I’D JUMP IN.  IF THERE WAS SOME HOLY WAR I’D FIGHT.  BUT I’M JUST SUPPOSED TO GENERATE A NEW SELF.  All evidence shows that people are subject to inertia. not just “they’re lazy” but “the winners win”.  Matthew Principle.  Whatever now i’m just whining. but i’m not, i’m just saying that things that are one way tend to stay that way.  gay people stay gay.  tall men stay tall and get pussy.  poor people stay poor, and if they don’t—if they get rich—it’s because they were more driven than they were poor. but they were always driven.  they didn’t start “undriven and poor”, then “become driven”, then “become rich.”  their poorness was incidental, their drivenness was essential.  the stronger vector determined their future.kafka. died a loser. van gogh. died a loser. but maybe that’s just 2 people in a history of billions. what else… well, lots of losers also died losers and STAYED LOSERS IN DEATH.  or lots of winners stayed winners in death.  and everything in between. who cares about post mortem though.  idk thats not my point. my point is, i can’t wrap my head around this shit, and i can’t embrace some sort of “well, it is what it is” shit for any meaningful degree of time either.

every day, forever.  watching myself. watching myself be this.

  


the big thing that saves me is always just around the corner. it’s like i’m a starving stray dog and i keep smelling the scent of freshly cooked meat wafting from somewhere, and i want to just lay down and die, but the smell of the meat keeps me sniffing, sniffing, walking around, searching.  it’s just an impulse.  my will and my impulse are at odds.  i can’t “just give up” because to do so, ironically, is extremely difficult, effortful, time consuming.  it takes coordination, conviction, decisiveness, disciplined action, to self-destruct, or to more concretely bring about my complete and utter downfall.  it takes courage. i don’t have that courage. the “quiet desperation” from that pink floyd song. just a mediocre loser.  just another schmuck who’s just sharp enough to realize he’s a pathetic mediocre loser schmuck but not sharp enough to do anything about it. and look—here i am, pitying myself. another habit of the mediocre.

  


it’s not even pity, i’m just writing this shit down because it’s coming to me.  “coming to me”, talking like some savante poet or whatever. i’m just writing down the shit that i’m perpetually bummed about.

  


it is strange how the panicked urgency and horrified despair of my 20s has mellowed into this defeated malaise. it’s like leaving a peace of raw meat on the counter indefinitely… there’s a peak rottenness at some point where the stench is unholy and the appearance ghastly, but after that peak it’s just… whatever…dry, rotten “post-meat”.  like, there’s nothing to flinch away from any more.  arguably the worst part is over, but also arguably, the worst part is now, and forever.

  


but part of me…speaking for the third time now, in terms of meat analogies (swear that wasn’t deliberate. just had a burger, so maybe that’s it. or maybe it’s cause i want to beat my meat. or maybe the scent of uneaten chicken nuggets wafting over from my desk are influencing me)—i still am smelling that meat, the dog thing i was saying, the hope/will to power analogy.  i still want to “win.” it’s like being down 5 runs in the bottom of the ninth— i must try; i do not believe i can turn things around; but part of me hopes i can; but i wish no part of me hoped that.  and here i am, quoting a meme i saw. i can’t even lament about my own life without realizing that the way i’m characterizing it has been more poignantly and cleverly characterized by some anonymous meme creator on the internet.  the particular thing i’m referencing was in a dr. k video about being the “man of inaction” or whatever—and the picture he jumpstarted his talk with was the “sobbing angry feels guy” surrounded by snippets of green text about things that basically acutely describe my life— aimless but had potential but still maybe do but wish you didn’t, etc etc………….. it’s agonizing.

  


god, i wish there was something that——FUCK!!!! I WAS GONNA SAY I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT FORCED ME TO DO SOMETHING, BUT THAT WAS IN THE DR. K VIDEO TOO.  i can’t even be original in my melancholy.  i’m no kafka—FUCK THAT’S EMBARRASSING THAT I WOULD EVEN IMPLY THAT TO MYSELF— i’m just a pathetic faggot like every other pathetic faggot.  literally just this extremely—

  


and yet, fuck it.  fucking fuck it.  i didn’t sign up for this shit.  give me my porn and fast food.  fuck did i ask for, to be born skinny with a big nose and a dead dad…. but auhghhghghg…… been watching those videos of the guy with the fucked up deformed face, and how much grace and gratitude he still has….. so i have no right to be self- whatever…… i have every advantage in the world. in many ways i am really one of the luckiest people on the planet.

  


but i do wish i could touch a woman. i do wish i could have sex, experience love, experience social joy.  i wish i could feel relatively happy for some period of my life, not just momentarily amused or distracted.  i wish i believed in something. i wish i contributed something to society or at least believed i was contributing something.  i wish i …………. i don’t know.

  


there’s no solution, that’s what kills me.  it’s like my life is one long song where the instruments are just being tuned, but they’re never quite in tune, and people are talking over it, and the recording quality is subpar. the violins, cellos, horns, everything is there—but it’ll never be harmony.  it’ll always just be this mild, unrelenting but uninteresting dissonance.  Like a bowl of gruel without salt, forever. No, that’s too dramatic and grim.  it’s just……… it’s just whatever.   it’s——fucking FUCKING IT FUCKING BOTHERS ME THIS SHIT IS FUCKING ANNOYING.

  


whatever.  not even success can make you happy. bourdain, matthew perry, bla bla bla.  whatever.  it’s fuckin lame.  it’s not even like “arrghh this is tough but be stoic and you’ll get through”.  no, because that imposes a structure that’s not actually there.  what i mean is, that stoic shit is like, it only makes sense if you look at life as like a video game that’s hard but you gotta tough it out, or like a workout that’s hard but you gotta tough it out, or whatever.  but life is not like that, because there’s no linearity, no promised reward, no clear end goal, no direction.  “you make your own direction! your own meaning!” no, that’s antithetical to what direction means, to what meaning means.  direction only has value in reference to other cardinal directions.  in outer space, there’s no north.  and meaning is the same.  something only means something in context. if there’s no context for anything, then you can’t generate meaning. i lost my train of thought. what am i saying? that life’s meaningless? boy that’s original. i guess specifically and more accurately i was arguing against the argument to the claim that life’s meaningless, namely the argument “well you gotta create your own meaning” and i was saying no that’s a logical impossibility.

  


whatever. wendy’s.  jacking off.  sleeping, drinking water.  Ecclesiastes/koholeth shit.  nothing better that i can figure out.

  


i just want to be rich and famous and a world-renowned happy beautiful genius who everyone loves, and i get to have sex with any woman i want to and do everything i want and feel perfectly happy at all times and everything.  that’s all",1,1751011779.0,deardiary,0,1.0,False

Well, Your Twin Got Me Pregnant - All our mutual friends were swooning over our love story: ""God, Ethan is absolutely obsessed with Aria! Reading Link","# Got the full version—DM if you're still looking.

Chapter 1



On the sixth time Ethan Harris cheated on me, he presented me with a four-hundred-million-dollar yacht with ""Aria West"" carved into its hull.



All our mutual friends were swooning over our love story: ""God, Ethan is absolutely obsessed with Aria!""



Only I stood there staring at the stern, where fresh paint barely concealed his mistress's name—a telltale golden ""J"" from ""Joanna"" still peeking through the white lacquer.



His buddy nudged him with a smirk: ""Dude, two names on one boat? Aria's gonna kill you if she found out.""



Ethan let out a cold laugh: ""No way. She'd just pretend to be blind like always.""



Clearly Ethan had no clue I’d already left the party. Meanwhile, I was lying on his twin brother’s bed:



""So... how exactly do we break it to your brother that I'm pregnant with his nephew?""



The man who controlled the entire Harris empire looked at me with unreadable emotions flickering in his eyes, his voice husky as he asked:



""I should ask you that question...""



""When are you planning to kick that loser off your ship and go public with me and the baby?""



Ethan threw a yacht party to celebrate his latest gift to me.



When I arrived, I walked straight into him making out with some starlet.



At the sight of this, I turned and headed to the deck for some fresh air.



""You must be Mrs. Harris?""



I spun around to find the same girl who'd been tongue-deep with my husband following me outside.



Her face still had that fresh-out-of-college innocence, but the heavy makeup made her look cheap rather than glamorous.



Seeing me stare, Joanna Brooks tossed her hair with practiced seduction, barely containing her smugness: ""I'm Ethan's girlfriend.""



""Maybe you've seen me on TV—I'm the star of that massive hit 'Hidden Secrets'—Ethan got me that role, actually..""



My marriage to Ethan had always been prime gossip material in our circle.



Now his mistress was confronting me directly.



Everyone nearby was practically straining to eavesdrop the drama.



I gave her a cold smile.



""You signed a five-year contract with Stellar Entertainment. I'm their largest shareholder. If I blacklist you, you won't see a single job for the next five years.""



Joanna lifted her chin defiantly: ""Ethan would never let you bully me.""



Her naivety was almost amusing to me.



""Feel free to test whether Ethan can override my decisions.""



The color drained from Joanna's face.



She'd hooked up with Ethan the moment she entered the showbiz, landed a lead role in her first project, and became an overnight sensation. She had no idea how cruel this world could be.



Indignant, Joanna pointed toward the yacht's stern: ""See that 'J' carved there? That's for Joanna Brooks—me!""



“It’s just Ethan’s lame trick to get women into his bed.”



""No way!"" she shot back. ""Ethan only changed it to your name so you wouldn't throw a fit.""



I laughed coldly. ""I don't need my name on some boat.""



""Though I do like him transferring ownership to me. Smart move on his part.""



I had better things to do than waste time with her. I turned and headed to the upper deck.



Chapter 2



Through the crack of the half-open door, I peered inside.



Ethan had lit a cigarette and was lounging back on the couch.



His best friend Murray Caldwell couldn't help but tease: ""Dude, two names on one yacht? Aria's gonna lose her shit when she finds out.""



Ethan let out a cold laugh: ""No way. She'd just pretend to be blind like always.""



The room erupted in laughter. ""True that. You've been cheating for three years straight. Aria only threw that fit the first time, then she's just rolled over and accepted all your side chicks.""



""Still, man, you gotta show her some respect. Bringing both your wife and mistress to the same party tonight? What if they run into each other? That's just humiliating for Aria.""



Under the dim lighting, Ethan said carelessly: ""If Aria sees Joanna, she'll just make herself scarce. She wouldn't dare cause a scene.""



Murray glanced at him with a smirk: ""Remember last time when Aria caught you with that little cute secretary? She made such a scene that both families found out. She was harshly scolded by Mr. West, and now she definitely won’t dare to cause any drama.""



Standing outside the door, I dug my nails into my palms, my chest aching like someone was squeezing my heart.



Ethan and I used to be childhood sweethearts—from dating in school uniforms to walking down the aisle in a wedding dress.



The night we got our marriage license, he was so happy he got drunk, eyes red-rimmed as he gripped my hand tight.



""Aria, I swear I'll only ever love you. If I ever do anything to hurt you, make you shed a single tear, I deserve to die—""



Before he could finish, I nervously covered his mouth: ""Don't say that. I trust you.""



But over three years of marriage, he cheated six times.



The first time, I cried my eyes out and smashed everything in our house.



The second time, I cornered him and some ins model at a hotel and dumped red wine all over him.



The fifth time, I stormed his office screaming, got caught on camera, the whole mess went viral. And caused both families' stock prices to tank.



...



Today marked his sixth affair.



I smiled faintly, slipped off my wedding ring, and dropped it into a passing waiter's champagne flute.



I pushed open the door. Everyone inside went quiet and turned to look.



Seeing it was me, they all stood up to greet me.



""Aria! Come sit next to Ethan.""



""I'm good.""



I chose a single armchair near Ethan instead.



Everyone exchanged glances.



Ethan lifted his eyes to look at me briefly, then flicked his cigarette ash.



I pulled out some papers from my bag and slid them across to him.



Ethan raised an eyebrow. Without opening them, he already knew what they were.



He removed the cigarette from his lips, stubbed it out, and let out a cold laugh:



""Still throwing tantrums? Didn't I already apologize with that yacht? If that's not enough, there's a new development—go pick out a penthouse.""



A cold, distant smile played at my lips:



""Look, you cheated. I’m taking seventy percent of everything we have, you get thirty. That’s more than fair. If you take this to court, you’ll end up with even less—ask your lawyer if you don’t believe me.""



Ethan's narrow eyes narrowed, his voice dropping: ""Aria, if you think I don't spend enough time with you, go ahead and get yourself a boyfriend. Don't worry, I won't be mad.""



Ethan said this only because he was certain I'd never cheat on him.



Even his buddies thought the same way.



But this time, he was dead wrong.



I couldn't help but smile: ""Already got one. That's why I want a divorce.""



The room fell dead silent, tension thick enough to cut.



Ethan's gaze turned ice-cold as he studied me, trying to figure out if I was bluffing.



Chapter 3



I lifted my eyes to meet his furious gaze, speaking each word clearly:



""Ethan, just sign the papers. I can't get a new marriage license until you do.""



Realizing I was serious, Ethan kicked the coffee table in front of him, his voice cutting like ice:



""Aria, say that shit to my face one more fucking time!!""



Murray froze for a few seconds before trying to mediate:



""Aria, just cool down. Don't joke around like this.""



""Yeah, you and Ethan have been through so much together these past three years. Talking divorce is just gonna hurt everyone.""



Ethan regained his composure, his expression unreadable:



""Did Joanna come after you? She tell you the yacht used to have her name on it? You want a divorce over that?""



Ethan rubbed his temples, letting out a cold laugh: ""Since when do you care about petty shit like this?""



My phone buzzed. It was Evan Harris.



Also Ethan's twin brother.



I smiled as I answered: ""I'm pretty much done here. I'll come find you once we dock.""



Ethan stared at the smile on my face like it physically hurt him.



After hanging up, I looked at Ethan seriously:



""Tomorrow morning my assistant will pick up the signed divorce papers. Let’s wrap this up clean—no reason to make it ugly for both of us.""



Ethan's anger flared up again.



He grabbed the ashtray and hurled it to the floor:



""Aria, what's your fucking problem? Just drop the drama!""



I'm not exactly known for my patience either—I grabbed a wine bottle and launched it at Ethan.



Ethan dodged, his expression hardened.



Just then the yacht docked. I walked off and got into a black Maybach.



In the dim light, the people on the yacht couldn't make out Evan's face clearly.



""So that's the male mistress who's sducing your wife? Looks kinda familiar though.""



""I think your brother has the same car? Too dark to see the license plate.""



""Bullshit. There's no way Aria would hook up with Ethan's own brother. Plus, everyone knows Evan Harris never touches women.""



Ethan's eyes narrowed, and hearing that name made him look over sharply:



""Evan Harris?""



Murray clapped him on the shoulder: ""Bro! The car's identical, and even from behind the guy looks exactly like your brother. Plus there's maybe three Maybachs with that setup in this entire city.""



Ethan watched the car disappear into the distance, his expression cold and calculating.



He lit a cigarette and blew a smoke ring into the air.



""Dig up everything you can on this man.""



Murray nodded.



""You better start paying more attention to Aria. If she's really set on this divorce, you're gonna regret it.""



Ethan scoffed: ""Just because some gold digger sweet-talked her. Give her a few days to cool off and she'll drop this divorce nonsense.""

Chapter 1



All of Manhattan knew about the PECULIAR TRADITION in the Forrester family, New York's wealthiest dynasty—Every new bride had to spend her wedding night alone in the family chapel, praying until dawn. Only those who emerged unharmed the next morning were considered blessed by the Forrester ancestors.



What once had been just a formality turned into a nightmare when Callum Forrester, the current heir, took a bride.



His bride was found dead in the chapel, her throat slashed with a gruesome wound, her limbs grotesquely twisted.



Every security camera was reviewed, but the footage clearly showed no one had entered the chapel that night except the bride herself.



Later, Callum married seven more times over the years, and horrifyingly, each bride met the same fate on her wedding night in that chapel.



Police investigations yielded nothing conclusive, and each death was eventually ruled a suicide.



Rumors spread throughout Manhattan—some claimed the Forrester estate was haunted, others whispered about dark rituals. No family would risk sending their daughter there anymore.



But today, I stood before Mrs. Forrester in a crimson dress, my posture graceful yet determined.



""Mr. Forrester is exceptionally handsome,"" I said. ""I've admired him from afar for years. I'm willing to be his ninth wife.""



I looked her directly in the eyes. ""Don't worry. Your ancestors may not have liked the others, but they'll certainly like me.""



\---



My family ran a small bakery on York Avenue.



Before dawn each morning, my sister would help our parents with the work—kneading dough, preparing fillings, making pastries, brewing coffee. She excelled at everything and never let me help.



""Melody, you're meant for academics,"" she would say. ""Just focus on your studies.""



""We'll support you all the way to success!""



Eight years ago, on the day I was announced as Manhattan's valedictorian.



My sister, dressed in a pristine white gown, shyly boarded the luxurious wedding car sent by the Forrester family.



Everyone envied her good fortune. While serving coffee one morning, she had somehow caught the eye of Callum Forrester, heir to the family fortune, and was now marrying into wealth and privilege.



I was happy for her too, not because of the Forrester fortune, but because of the shy, joyful look on her face before she left:



""Melody, don't worry about me. Callum is truly kind, and his family has been welcoming,"" she said, holding my hands. ""I need to fly higher so you can go further. You'll always be the sister I'll protect with everything I have!""



That night, I dreamed my sister had a beautiful baby who called me ""Auntie"" in the sweetest voice while clutching my shirt.



But the next morning, the shocking news of my sister's death shattered our world.



I raced to the Forrester estate, arriving just as they carried her out on a crude stretcher.



My sister's once delicate hands were now bruised and gray. Her fingertips were bloody, all ten nails forcibly torn off, the flesh raw and mangled.



Despite everyone's attempts to stop me, I yanked back the sheet covering her.



Her death was horrifying—a gaping wound across her throat, her body twisted unnaturally, her eyes bulging like a fish's.



Her pristine white gown was soaked through with blood, a pool of it staining the stretcher beneath her.



I felt the world spinning as I collapsed to the ground.



But then I heard my father's sickeningly servile tone as he kowtowed to Callum.



""This terrible incident must be Victoria's fault—she simply wasn't worthy of the Forrester ancestors' blessing.""



""Mr. Forrester, you're young and successful. You'll definitely find a much better wife in the future. Please don't waste your grief on someone so worthless!""



Though we weren't wealthy, my father had always been kind to us sisters, never speaking harshly to either of us.



When relatives once mocked him for having ""worthless daughters,"" he had grabbed a kitchen knife and confronted them.



Now I couldn't believe these words were coming from his mouth.



""Who would've thought I'd marry a mental case? Killing herself in the chapel on our wedding day—what terrible luck!""



""Get rid of her quickly. The sight is giving me a headache.""



Callum's face was dark with annoyance, showing no grief or pain as he turned to leave.



My sister treasured life above all else and had promised to protect me forever—how could she possibly have committed suicide?!



Red-eyed, I moved to confront them, only to be struck hard across the face by my father.



""It's your sister's fault for not being fortunate enough to marry into such a good family!""



""Stop embarrassing yourself and come home with me now!""



I saw stars from the impact as my father dragged me away amid the whispers and stares of onlookers.



The incident caused an uproar throughout Manhattan, prompting a special investigation team from the state.



Shockingly, the conclusion matched Callum's claim—my sister had committed suicide.



The Forrester estate had stringent security, and all surveillance footage was perfectly preserved. The recordings clearly showed that after my sister entered the chapel, no one else went in. The audio recordings captured even the sound of mosquitoes flying but recorded no screams.



Chapter 2



Outside the chapel doors and windows, everything remained peaceful until the next morning when Callum and his mother opened the door and discovered my sister's body.



The medical examiner carefully checked every suspicious detail and ruled out homicide.



Everyone calmly accepted this conclusion—everyone except me.



After spending the summer break crying, I enrolled at Princeton University as planned.



Not because I cared about my future, but because it had been my sister's greatest wish for me.



I abandoned the popular finance major and instead chose the obscure field of criminal investigation.



After completing my undergraduate studies, I continued with a combined master's and doctoral program. I studied harder than anyone, terrified of missing any knowledge that might help me solve the mystery of my sister's death.



Eight years later, I returned to Manhattan again.



Much had happened with the Forrester family during my absence. After my sister, Callum had married seven more wives.



These seven women came from vastly different backgrounds, with varied appearances and personalities.



Yet each bride had died by apparent suicide in the family chapel on her wedding night.



Particularly noteworthy was the eighth wife, married just six months ago—Darla Thompson, a butcher's daughter from the marketplace. She weighed nearly 300 pounds and was strong enough to knock out a grown man with one punch, with a notoriously volatile temper.



Her father had gambling debts of $500,000, and the Forresters, desperate for a bride, had promised her $20 million in cash and ten commercial properties in Marina City if she survived the night.



Darla tried—but didn't make it out alive.



Callum had attempted to persuade his family to abandon the chapel ritual, but Mrs. Forrester insisted it was a tradition passed down through generations that could not be broken.



This led to rumors spreading throughout Manhattan—some said the Forrester estate was haunted by malevolent spirits determined to end the family line; others whispered that the Forresters were sacrificing brides to feed otherworldly beings in exchange for their incredible wealth.



Whatever the truth, no family across the country was willing to send their daughter there anymore.



Yet on my second day back in Manhattan, I dressed in a striking crimson dress, applied flawless makeup, and appeared at the Forrester estate's entrance.



""Tell your mistress I'm willing to be Callum Forrester's ninth wife.""



News of my request to marry Callum spread through Manhattan like wildfire.



Though Manhattan wasn't small, gossip traveled faster than any virus.



""I heard Melody Vincent just returned yesterday and is already offering to marry Callum Forrester. Both sisters are just gold-diggers!""



""Poor Mr. Vincent—he used to brag about how brilliant his daughter was, but look at her now, falling at the feet of money just like her sister.""



""Money aside, those Forrester rumors should give anyone pause. Looks like the Vincent family might lose both daughters to that cursed place!""



Everyone in Manhattan branded me as a shallow gold-digger.



The fact that I was a Princeton graduate with a doctorate made the contrast all the more shocking and thrilling to them.



Inside the Forrester estate, Mrs. Forrester had me brought to her.



""Melody Vincent, do you truly want to marry my son?"" she asked, studying me with interest.



""More certain than gold is pure!"" I replied with a smile.



""Everyone knows Mr. Forrester is refined, gentle, and friendly—not to mention his net worth recently surpassed ten billion. What reason could I possibly have not to like him?""



Mrs. Forrester responded with a cold laugh.



""I knew you couldn't genuinely care for Callum!""



The disgust in her eyes was unmistakable.



But I knew she had no choice.



""Look, I'm not gonna beat around the bush,"" she said.



""You haven't forgotten what happened to your sister in our family chapel eight years ago, have you?""



""During the eight years you've been away, a new bride has died in that chapel each year. What makes you think you'll live longer than they did?""



Chapter 3



Mrs. Forrester's piercing gaze fixed on me.



I smiled faintly.



""Don't worry, Mrs. Forrester. I'm different from those ordinary women. Your ancestors may not have liked them, but they'll certainly approve of me!""



I stared back at her with proud confidence.



She studied me for a long time before finally nodding in agreement.



""Go prepare yourself. Only by surviving tonight can you prove you're different from the others!""



She dismissed me with a wave.



I smiled, knowing all truths would be revealed tonight!



When I returned home, my parents were already waiting.



""What madness is this? Who gave you permission to agree to marry Callum Forrester?!"" My father's face was flushed with anger.



My mother anxiously wiped away tears, her eyes filled with sorrow as she looked at me.



But as I faced my father, I felt nothing.



""Since when have you cared who I marry?"" I asked, staring into his eyes.



""What nonsense! Why wouldn't I care? Don't you know about the Forrester rumors? Going there is practically suicide! Are you trying to put me and your mother in an early grave?""



My father desperately tried to make me see reason.



But I only coldly asked: ""If you truly cared, you wouldn't have let Victoria die in vain back then.""



My father's entire body trembled, his lips quivering.



""Melody, don't speak to your father like that. Your father…"" my mother began.



""Shut up!"" he snapped harshly when my mother tried to defend him.



Then he glared at me intensely.



""Fine, since you've made your decision, I won't interfere anymore.""



""From this day forward, you are no longer my daughter!""



My father drove me from the house despite my mother's desperate pleas, but he remained unmoved.



After leaving, I bowed deeply toward my parents' home.



""Dad, Mom, your daughter has been unfilial.""



""If I can uncover the truth, I promise I'll return to care for you properly!""



I whispered before turning toward the end of the alley.



Callum's wedding procession was even more extravagant than eight years ago—a line of Rolls-Royces that anyone would envy.



""Well, that's it for the Vincent family line!""



""All those years of fancy education, and that Princeton doctorate isn't worth squat, is it?""



The neighbors lining the alley had all come out to mock me with their cruel taunts.



Yet I boarded the car without hesitation.



The procession moved slowly, taking half an hour to reach the vicinity of the Forrester family chapel.



But when we were still about five hundred yards from the chapel, the driver refused to go any further.



""Miss Vincent, may God be with you. We wouldn't go near that place even if you killed us,"" the driver said, turning to me.



I nodded slightly, then got out and looked ahead.



Perhaps it was the poor weather, or perhaps the area truly was heavy with malevolent energy, but the summer night suddenly felt bone-chillingly cold.



The dark alley ahead resembled a path to hell, yet I walked forward with determined steps.



A few minutes later, I stood before the Forrester family chapel.



The door creaked open, and Mrs. Forrester stood in the entrance beckoning to me.



Perhaps it was her overly pale makeup, but I couldn't shake the impression she resembled a paper effigy.



Mrs. Forrester thrust a prayer book into my hands.



""Go. Recite the prayers,"" she instructed coldly.



""Read them through once, then again. I advise you not to fall asleep—otherwise... well, who knows what might happen.""



Her eyes held a strange mixture of contempt and pity as she looked at me.



Beside her, Callum emerged from the chapel with several others.



He glanced at me dismissively.



""Your sister was much prettier than you, but it doesn't matter now. I'd marry a pig if it survived the night!""



Callum's face was filled with arrogance.



I silently clenched my fists.



I remained convinced that Callum had done something to my sister!



Now my enemy stood before me, yet I could do nothing—the frustration was unbearable.



""May I enter now?"" I asked, looking at Mrs. Forrester.



She didn't speak, merely gesturing for someone to open the inner doors of the chapel.



I walked step by step toward the unknown abyss, my heart growing heavier with each step.



The door slowly closed behind me.



As the last sliver of light disappeared, I found myself in complete darkness.



Whoosh!



Suddenly, candles on the walls ignited, their flickering light making everything around me seem eerily distorted.



My heart raced involuntarily, especially when I first glimpsed the portraits of Forrester ancestors on the walls—my fear reached its peak.



Ahead, memorial tablets were arranged neatly, with a prayer mat placed on the floor.



I took a deep breath, gathering my courage to approach, kneeling on the mat.



Then I opened the prayer book, trying to calm myself.



But just as I prepared to begin reciting, something suddenly occurred to me.



""Let me out! Let me out right now!""



""I know what's happening!""



""I know why all those brides died mysteriously!""

Funny thing is, if you'd asked me in the past, I would have told you that I generally care about the environment and think we should limit the use of fossil fuels. And yet I ordered something from Ali Express almost every single week. I spent my hard earned (and limited!) money on shitty, plastic garbage that inevitably will end up in landfill and was created using exploitation and human suffering. Clothes, jewelry, accessories, presents, home decor.

The thing is, I wasn't exactly ignorant of this. I chose to ignore it. The dopamine hit I got from my shopping addiction made my denial stronger.

I don't know exactly what happened but at the start of this year I made a valiant effort to minimize my environmental impact. I switched to an eco friendly cleaning product service. I stopped buying coffee pods and now instead use a subscription service that gives you not-so-perfect pods that are usually destined for landfill (that are still recyclable). I now buy only from thrift shops and even then I only buy something if I have it on my list first. I do not impulse purchase. I only buy in bulk if the product is on sale and it's a product that I already use. I switched to soap bars and other products that do not use plastic packaging (although this is not always possible).

But most importantly, I deleted every single shopping app on my phone. 

I am so disgusted with the past me. I cannot believe how much I contributed to waste and destroying our planet. Never again. ",6,1751011328.0,Anticonsumption,5,1.0,False

Prior to that I was more like 2 coffees plus 2 teas.

Anytime I went 24 hours without coffee I'd always get the usual withdrawal symptoms (headaches)

About 2 months ago I decided to drop coffee entirely, but have continued drinking 3 or 4 teas every day. I've slept better (also helps that my 3yo has been sleeping well last few months). I feel more fully rested when I wake, I think I've been dreaming more.

And I think I'm starting to *notice* my anxiety more now, and I think it's more manageable (it's particularly noticeable in the morning)

I do miss the rush I get from coffee, I had a craving for one yesterday but I resisted and just had water.

So, anyway, last few days I've stopped drinking caffeinated tea also, and starting to notice a craving for that also. I never even noticed I had a craving for tea - I've been drinking tea since I was 15 (I'm 41 now).

I'm gonna try drinking more flavoured water to at least give me something a little more interesting than plain water!",2,1751011300.0,decaf,0,1.0,False
1lloanq,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lloanq/im_a_serial_killer_i_met_something_scarier/,I'm a serial killer. I met something scarier.,"It was 3:17am at the Waffle House. I wiped my mouth with my sleeve and pushed the table away from my fat belly, the metal chair scraping the greasy floor. 

I had time to kill until the next job, so I headed out to the parking lot to make my way to the nearest motel. I hadn't come through this town yet, so no one should recognize me there, I figured.

Stumbling with my bum leg past the dumpsters, I about had a damn heart attack when the lid slammed. 

I shook my head and kept going.

Another slam.

Rage boiled over me. I stopped to glare back at the dumpsters, waiting to see which methed out employee had been responsible. 

The wood doors around the dumpsters creaked in the night wind, closing themselves slowly.

Another slam and the door popped open. Looking like he'd kicked it open with his foot, the employee strolled out carelessly. Whistling a jolly little tune, even.

I rolled my shoulders and huffed. This fucker was about to learn some respect. I cracked my knuckles and headed back towards him. 

""Hey!"" I shouted. 

He stopped, startled. I closed the distance and grabbed a fistful of his greasy black apron. He was mid-forties maybe, but looked eighty - he had the classic sunken eyes and leathery skin of hard living or drugs. He just stood there, mouth agape, like the stupid animal he was. I wanted to knock out his nasty black teeth.

""Do you have *any* idea--""

""Hey, you there!"" Another voice interrupted me.

The other man leaned against the building by the door, one hand in his pocket and the other smoking a cigarette. I must've been too angry to have noticed him before.

""I've been looking for a truck driver,"" he said.

My grip on the employee tightened in rage. He was shaking now. 

""'Scuse me?"" I yelled back.

""I could use a ride,"" the man said calmly, ""If you'd be so kind.""

Getting a better look at him, I was more confused. He wasn't an employee, he didn't have the stupid black apron. He wore dusty boots, raggedy jeans and a gray zip-up jacket, but his face was what interested me. Young, bright eyes, pale and smooth skin, *blonde*. Like a halo around his head. 

My anger was replaced by something else. Something darker. 

I threw the employee to the ground. ""Get lost,"" I told him. He scrambled away, where to I didn't care to look. My focus was on someone else now.

I made my way to the other man, wary but interested.

""You ain't got fuckin' family to help you?"" I asked.

He was pretty. *Too* pretty. Like one of those weird celebrities with too-perfect faces. I couldn't look away.

Surely someone would miss him if something happened to him.

""Nope,"" he answered, stomping out his cigarette, ""there's no one to care.""

He picked up the cigarette butt and flicked it into the can beside him. Like he didn't want to litter, like that one cigarette would really make a difference. 

""'Cept you, maybe,"" he said with a smile and a wink, ""maybe I can convince you to care.""

Something about him felt charming. Playful. A little ray of life in this hellhole. 

He didn't belong here.

Of course, neither did the *others* I'd picked up.

I just had one question. 

""How old are you?"" I asked.

Those blue eyes looked me up and down, studying me. Not in a nervous manner, but something else. It made me a little uncomfortable but not enough for me to care.

""Nineteen,"" he said after a pause. 

The darkness stirred again.

This was too good to be true. 

""I've got a little cash on me,"" he said, ""I'm sure we could work something out.""

I had already decided the minute I saw him.

""Fine,"" I told him, ""Hurry up.""

He smiled, a little too wide. 

""You're too kind,"" he said.

I scoffed, ""Yeah, bud, I'm a real saint.""

-

""So, where ya headed?"" I asked as we settled into the cab.

""Anywhere's better than here,"" he said.

I stifled a smile. It was funny when they said things they'd regret.

""You really got no one out here? Not family, not a girlfriend, nothin'?""

He paused to think. Then leaned a little closer, a wry, shit-eating grin on that perfect face. 

""You really think I'd be in your truck if I did?""

I chuckled openly at that one, ""Yeah, okay, you got me there.""

""Well, it's gonna be a while 'til the next stop,"" I warned him.

""Perfect"" he said, settling into his seat, ""Maybe I *will* have a friend by the end of this.""

I rolled my eyes, ""Yeah, whatever,"" I said.

His weird sense of humor was a nice change of pace, I thought. This ride might actually be enjoyable.

I usually didn't enjoy their company until they were hogtied in the back.

-

*""Last gas 103 miles""*, the sign read. 

Another hour and we'd be at the spot I'd picked out. 

*""You ever get scared out here?""*

His voice startled me. It sounded different, distorted almost. I chalked it up to the altitude fucking with my ears. 

It was the first thing he had said in maybe thirty, forty minutes, I had actually thought he was sleeping. He had been awfully quiet ever since we'd gotten off the main roads. 

""I ain't scared of nothin', kid,"" I told him. 

""C'mon, everybody gets scared,"" He pushed on, leaning closer to me like he had a secret, ""Sometimes it's even fun to be scared.""

Now *that* was funny.

I'd have to tease him about that later.

""Why the hell would I be scared out here?""

""Well, for starters,"" he said, ""there's no one else around. No one to see you, no one to hear you, no one to help you...""

I was chuckling now too, shaking my head. That was kind of the point of this, kid.

""Nothing but the pines and the fog off the creek,"" he continued.

""Well, the fog *is* annoying, I'll give you that,"" I said, ""I can't tell you how many times a fucking deer just pops out and smears itself all over the windshield.""

Even then, the fog was so thick I couldn't see but maybe a single car length in front of us. The truck lights only made it worse. I powered through up the hills like I always did. There were never any other vehicles on that road. 

""Ah, the poor deer,"" he said. ""They used to have more natural predators out here. But they were all driven off a long, long time ago.""

Something was off about him. Different. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but the warm and sunny act he'd put on earlier was gone. He felt cold now, distant, a little creepy even.

It didn't matter. We were almost there.

We sat in silence for another little while. I kept my eyes to the fog swirling in the headlights, he kept his eyes locked on me. Staring, without a word, like I'd vanish if he even fucking blinked.

Hell, maybe *he* was getting scared now. 

He had every right to, after all. 

The air in the cab got colder. It was supposed to be a warm night, I thought. Condensation built up on the window from the sudden change. I flipped the wipers on, sighing as they made that god-awful, nails-on-a-chalkboard screech with every swipe. 

The biggest spider I've ever seen in my life crawled out of the air vent.

""Holy shit!""

It was the size of my fucking fist, hairy and dark with yellow stripes on its legs.

I'm a proud man, not afraid of much. But I don't fuck around with goddamn tarantulas. I nearly lost control of the truck trying to whack it back to whatever hell it came from.

Silently, without even so much as a flinch, the other man placed his pale, smooth hand atop the dash. Palm up, like an offering. My mouth hung open as the spider went into his palm, and just as quickly, into his zip-up jacket.

I almost couldn't speak.

""What the FUCK was that, man!?"" I stammered, ""I swear to god if that's your FUCKING PET--""

""It's not,"" he said calmly, ""unless it wants to be.""

I was gonna explode. Surely, I would stroke-out any minute.

""And it looks to be a Tiger Wolf Spider, but I'm not an entomologist.""

""Take that thing out of your pocket, NOW,"" I demanded.

He took out the spider calmly, like it was a pack of smokes, like any of this was *normal.*

Looking at it the second time was almost worse. I squinted my eyes and looked away to the road.

""Kill that fucking thing!"" 

*""You'd like that, wouldn't you?""*

The voice wasn't his.

It waa a woman's. *Hers.* From last week.

I glanced over. 

She was in the passenger seat again. Tiny, frail like a bird, a little button-nose and blue eyes. Yellow-blonde hair. The skin on half her face was gone to gorey bone, including a hollow eye-socket. The spider climbed into it.

""What the FUCK--""

I slammed on the brakes.

The truck skid to a stop as I caught my breath. I  looked around, frantically. The young man looked groggy, bewildered. He rubbed his eyes and ran his hands through his hair.

""How long was I out?"" He asked.

""W-what do-- what the *FUCK* are you talking about!?""

My heart thumped in my ears, my throat was dry and my body soaked in sweat. I was shaking. The man was calm, half-asleep, looking at me like I had two heads.

He reached in his pocket and pulled out a pack of smokes. No spider.

""You wanna take a break?"" He asked me, concern in his soft voice.

This didn't make sense.

""Where's the goddamn spider?"" I demanded.

He jolted upright, looking in his seat and around the cab. ""There's a spider in here? Where?""

I ran my clammy hands over my face, rubbing my eyes.

I looked around the cab. Everything looked...normal. The young man just blinked at me, like an innocent little doe in headlights, hand still outstretched with the pack of smokes.

I ripped the pack from his hands. 

""We're taking a break,"" I said. 

""Cool,"" he said, disinterested. He started to follow me out of the truck.

""No, you wait inside,"" I snapped. 

""Alrighty,"" he chimed back.

I stepped out into the humid, foggy air. The temperature shocked me - it had been so much colder in the cab. I must've turned the damn AC on and not known it. 

This wasn't the spot I usually took them to, but it was close enough. Far away enough where no, no one could see or hear anything, just like that stupid kid said. It would do just fine, and I could just drive his body out farther to where I usually dumped them. But after that weird...dream, I wasn't sure I *wanted* to go where the other ones were. Maybe I would just carve out a new spot here, I thought. 

I was around the back mixing up two special cups of joe when I heard the passenger door open and close. I went back around quickly.

""Goddammit I *said* stay in the--""

No one was there. The truck lights flickered and a cold chill shook my body. I peered through the fog but there was nothing.

Maybe I *was* going a little crazy.

Maybe I was just tired. 

I took the mugs back to the inside of the cab and carefully handed the correct one to the man beside me.

""Coffee?"" I asked.

""I'm not a coffee person,"" he said politely.

""Everyone says that until they have *my* coffee,"" I winked.

He laughed and shook his head. ""You're terrible,"" he said, grinning wide with those perfect teeth.

I watched him absolutely gulp his coffee down like a sick, dying camel. 

Confused, I took a small sip of mine. It nearly burned my lip clean off.

Weird. But at least it wouldn't take as long to work, I figured. 

""So, what's your story?"" I asked him, realizing I never played the get-to-know-you game that I usually slog through with my passengers. 

""Oh, I'm just an old soul passing through,"" he said. ""My story's a long one. I don't think we'd have the time to cover it if we tried.""

""See, that. You're so young but you talk like an old fuckin' man,"" I chuckled, ""I mean, where do you get that? Where are you from?""

""Well, my ex girlfriend thought I was from the depths of hell,"" he sat his mug down, completely finished with it, ""but I assured her I'm Catholic.""

I laughed at his joke, a little too loud. I sipped my coffee. ""Women, eh?""

""I thought she was an angel. I still do,"" he said, ""but now... I doubt she could even walk into church  without bursting into flames.""

I slapped my knee, doubling over. I couldn't remember the last time I laughed so hard. My cheeks were warm. 

""You're too young to be having f-fuckin' women problems,"" I told him.

""Hmm,"" he murmured. ""But just the right age to die.""

I blinked. ""Huh?""

""That's the perfect age, isn't it?"" he said, ""Eighteen to twenty-one? Blonde hair, blue eyes, no one to miss them?""

I stammered. My thoughts were... clunky. I hadn't realized how dizzy I was getting.

No.

*No.*

That wasn't possible. I made the coffee myself, I gave him the coffee myself, he downed it in seconds! 

The cab was freezing cold again. 

My head spun, my thoughts racing. The air was humid, my mouth so dry it felt glued together. 

I was spacing out. Losing time.

Suddenly, I was in the back of the truck on the cot, where *he* was supposed to be.

The fog rolled in with me. Against it he stood, at the edge of the open truck, a dark shape in the night.

""You know, Father Romano says I shouldn't harm 'anything with a soul'"", he said. The distortion was back in his voice, like an old corrupted mix tape. He was holding rope in his hand. 

""And to tell you the truth,"" he continued, ""I've always had a soft spot for animals, so I've never liked hurting them.""

In a blink, he was next to me. Tying off my arm. Like a tourniquet. 

""But you don't *have* a soul, do you?"" 

He was in my face, inches away, so close he blurred.

""And you're *worse* than an animal because YOU. KNOW. BETTER!""

Tears rolled down my face, the sheer thunder of his voice shaking me to my core. It was unnatural. *Ungodly.*

""Why did you do it?"" His voice was soft, calm, as harmless as it had been before. ""Why did you kill all those poor little girls and boys? And to leave their bodies like that, dumped so... unceremoniously in my backyard."" 

He shook his head at me, frowning, ""At least I kill for a reason.""

His limbs began...snapping. Loud pops as they twisted, contorted, grew taller and longer. A black shadow overtook his body, erasing all trace of his humanity in a blink, like he had never had skin or clothes or even a face to begin with. There was nothing. Only a dark shape remained, made of long twisted muscle and bone, shaped like some bastardized version of a man with horns. 

Then, a smile appeared. That wide smile, so perfect and *sharp*. 

I couldn't scream. I couldn't move. 

I tried to stay awake but I was fading fast.

The figure launched towards me on all fours, moving like a spider on its freaky limbs. It was over top of me in seconds.

""God, I'm *SO HUNGRY!*"" 

His face was almost pressed against mine, bared teeth dripping saliva onto my nose and mouth. I felt nothing.

He rose back up in a blink, standing upright, legs bending to fit in the trailer. He wiped his mouth carefully and ran a clawed hand through the silhouette of his once-beautiful hair, right between his horns. He sighed.

""But I have to be patient,"" he said softly, ""You need to last... a while. I suppose I'll pick you apart, piece by piece, rationing your disgusting body...""

His face was in front of mine again, grinning.

""And then when I'm done making you useful, I'm not going to kill you - oh no, that's too easy for you...""

Everything was fading fast, patches of black closing in on me.

He grabbed my face with a clawed hand, pulling me close to make sure I heard every word.

""I'm going to dump your limbless body with all the people you've killed, way out here in the pines. You can use your *fucking teeth* to dig your way out of the mud, choking on it like you deserve.""

He dropped my face, my head slamming back down.

Everything went dark. 

I prayed I wouldn't wake up again. Not to this.

In **Belgium**, our mornings were quiet and structured: bathroom time, breakfast at home (usually chocolate bread and hot chocolate), pack the bag, and leave. School started at 8:15.

In **Germany**, it’s totally different. We start with milk or coffee, then bathroom time — but breakfast is packed and eaten at school or daycare. School starts much earlier, around 7:30, so everything feels rushed.

In **India**, I remember mornings being much slower. Wake-up was around 8am, starting with tea, then a full meal in the morning, bathroom time, and off to school or work. Workdays seem to start later, around 10 or 11am. I’m not as familiar with the school schedule there though.

For me, the hardest part was actually in India — I’m a morning person, so just **standing there drinking tea or coffee for 30 minutes** felt frustrating. I wanted to *do* something!

The first few times I met him I was in a relationship but we got along really well. I’ve since broken up with my ex a month or two ago and started hanging out with my best friend a lot more and in turn spending more time with her roommate. He’s very sweet and a gentleman for sure, we have the same taste in music and movies and hobbies. Him and I ended up getting quite close as well. I found him very attractive and honestly had been flirting with him for a while. One night recently, I ended up sleeping in his bed with him because I couldn’t fall asleep on the couch (thanks to the mushrooms+my best friend had been sleeping for a couple hours at this point) but he was very polite and didn’t even come near me that night. had a pillow in between us and everything. the next night I ended up staying again and in his room, that night once again at first nowhere near me.. and me being me was flirting more and ending up moving closer and then we ended up just cuddling all night. fast forward a day or two I end up going back over spending the night and same thing. The next day I wanted to go back to my house for a few days but also wanted company so I invited both my best friend and her roommate to my house to spend the night and continue our movie marathon that we had started the night prior. My friend ended up staying home and the roommate and I ended up continuing the marathon, we ended up having sex that night. He’s spent the night a few times since and we have had sex a couple more times since. Not every time he stayed either. My point is is that he’s very very sweet, he wakes me up with coffee and breakfast , he didn’t let me mow my own lawn, he’s also been extremely kind throughout my whole breakup as well. It was a 4.5 year relationship so I wasn’t doing well for a while, but I guess I’m asking if this is too big of an age gap, I wouldn’t go out of my way to date someone his age and honestly with his history I don’t think he would either, but we get along really well and like I said have a lot in common, so is it weird? help. pleaseee ",1,1751010633.0,relationship_advice,6,0.67,False
1llo4tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1llo4tj/whats_actually_going_on_with_the_world_right_now/,What's Actually Going On With the World Right Now,"Hey guys, lately a lot of streams have touched on real-world events. But often the way this stuff gets explained makes it seem super complicated or lacks larger context, so here is part of what is actually going on in simple terms you can relate to:



**Why is the world like this right now?**

Since the 1990s, the world has operated under something called ""globalism,"" which basically means most countries depend heavily on trading with each other, sharing resources, and following certain ""rules""—mainly set by the US and Europe. To make sure all this trade can happen smoothly, the US Navy patrols the oceans to prevent disruptions to trade.



**Why does this cause so many problems?**

Globalism sounds good on paper, but in practice, it often means countries (including the US) are pressured into joining a system they might not actually benefit from (including the US). If they refuse, they risk getting morally scolded, gaslit, sanctioned, or invaded (NOT the US on that last one). This has led to a ton of wars in the last 30 years. Every time, it's framed as a fight about democracy, freedom, or human rights. But a lot of the time, it's actually about oil, gas, or making sure countries stay plugged into the global trade network.



**Why does America do this?**

Historically, the US is actually naturally isolationist—meaning it doesn't need the rest of the world to survive. It has:

* Tons of farmland
* Very over powered internal river systems for cheap industrial transportation
* Huge oil and natural gas reserves, and other abundant natural resources
* Protected by two oceans that make invasion of North America only slightly more feasible to invade than Mars. It isn't wrong to think of the New World as being very similar to being on another planet in many practical terms.



The US got dragged into world conflicts first because of the World Wars making industrial war something new and horrifying like no wars before them, and then because it agreed to act as Europe's protector against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. After the Cold War ended, instead of going home, the US was convinced to keep policing the world to support the global trade system, often pushed into action by European countries who needed America’s military might to enforce European interests.



**Why is Europe so invested in globalism?**

Europe is very resource-poor and existentially dependent on open trade routes (Freedom of Navigation) and the global trade system (the ""Rules-Based Order""). Historically, Europe's lack of resources drove centuries of colonialism, where they forcibly took resources from weaker countries. Globalism today serves as a modern replacement for colonialism, allowing Europe to access necessary resources through legally coercive trade rather than direct occupation. This explains why the US, despite having vast oil and gas reserves itself, keeps fighting or being involved in petrowars: it's not about America's own energy needs—it's about ensuring Europe continues receiving the oil and gas it desperately requires. When interacting with Europe, you have to recognize that their deep dependency makes them extremely manipulative—they absolutely need globalism to survive economically, and they'll do or say nearly anything to ensure America continues to support it. Always remember, Europe has fought more wars than any other continent, more than the Middle East. Especially when many of the wars on OTHER continents were just Europeans fighting wars on a new continent. In George Washington's farewell address he specifically warned about not getting entangled in European alliances. 



**But does it have to be this way?**

Actually, no. The US could stop doing this very quickly. It could bring back and scrap its massive aircraft carriers (which are very expensive and mainly useful for bullying smaller countries) and focus instead on its own security. It could:

* Defend itself primarily through submarines and aircraft—a strategy clearly demonstrated by the Soviet/Russian Navy during the Cold War, designed specifically as a defensive force to counter the US Navy. Everyone in naval leadership already knows exactly what a defensive navy looks like because they've seen one, and it's significantly cheaper, safer, and doesn't involve a large number of aircraft carriers.
* Stop invading or threatening countries unless directly attacked, or act only as a kingmaker in regional conflicts where there is a clear bad actor that regional players are willing to confront themselves but would highly benefit from specialized technical military support such as air power and intelligence capabilities (i.e. the US only shoots down ballistic missiles and then drops 12 super bunker busters and told all parties the war is over. No occupation or nation building).
* Trade with the world, but without trying to force everyone into one system. Or it could mostly NOT trade with the world because North America has what it needs already. Or trade only when it is a good deal for both sides. In practical terms, the main impact for everyday Americans would be much more expensive luxury goods like coffee, TVs, phones, and clothes—but much less expensive essentials like housing, healthcare, food, and education. When you're no longer burdened by high costs for basic needs, it becomes much easier to handle paying more for genuine luxuries. This is how it used to be: houses were cheap, but a TV in every room was crazy expensive. Five TVs and no house sucks compared to one house and one TV.

This isn't just theory—it's literally how America operated successfully for a long time before WWII. North America can and has effectively operated as what is known as an autarky—an economically independent country. Being an autarky is very rare, but you got lucky. Don't let somebody gaslight you into not participating in your good luck.



**Why doesn’t this happen?**

Because the current global setup benefits some powerful groups:

* Huge corporations that get cheap, borderline slave, labor from overseas.
* Politicians and institutions that gain power from controlling global rules.
* European countries that rely on the US military instead of spending their own money to enforce the sea lanes and rules that benefit them.

These groups use a ton of moral arguments and emotional manipulation to keep the US entangled in wars and global policing, even when it doesn't benefit everyday Americans.



**Yes, but why everyone being insane though?**

Globalism hasn't benefited the average American and politicians like Trump or Bernie are the manifestation of the gut level understanding of this. People are looking to see action leading back to American isolationist adjacent autarky historically enabled by North American geography and resources. For resource poor Europe this is an existential threat as they rely on the US military to enforce the world order they need to manipulate to survive. It is like trying to dump a broke but extremely manipulative girlfriend who has no job skills and relies on you to pay her bills. Not all girls (or even most) are bad, but we all know breaking up with that one is going to involve non-stop lies, hysterics, and waterworks. She is existentially cooked into homelessness if you leave, so you can't expect her to behave otherwise in the face of that existential threat. Don't get mad, just pack your stuff in silence and get out in the knowledge that you are self sufficient and will be fine on your own and her problems are her problems. The more obvious it is that the average American isn't benefiting from globalism the higher the emotional volume will become to change the subject or to keep you entangled in arguments where the net effect is you never quite get out the door and leave. Europe, the globalist class, and their proxies like the media are melting down because you are getting closer to the door and they are completely cooked if you reach it. If you lose track of the door, close your eyes and just keep moving in the direction that makes the media, academics, and NGOs scream and carry on louder and act more insane.



**TL;DR:**

* America doesn’t have to police the world—it chooses to because powerful groups benefit from it. You, as the average American, are not in that group. Nor do you need to try and find a way into it, because unlike a European, you have your own natural resources.
* Constant wars and global tensions are largely due to keeping a global trade system running, not just ""spreading democracy"" that never seems to spread to anywhere but countries reluctant to engage in trade on globalist terms.
* The US can easily step back to an isolationist stance because it's not losing or being denied access to resources it needs to thrive. Simply by existing in North America, the US has already won—most Americans don't realize how incredibly unfair North America's resource abundance and geographic security actually are. They've been led to believe participating in the global order and extracting resources from poorer countries is a necessary evil for maintaining their comfortable lives, which is true for resource-poor Europe but completely false for North America. Europe relies on perpetuating this misconception because their survival literally depends on it. By not participating in global conflicts and manipulative alliances, the US can remain prosperous and secure.



Next time someone tells you these conflicts are unavoidable or morally necessary, remember that the world doesn't have to run like this—it's a choice that's being made, not a requirement, and that choice is benefiting somebody.

after i stopped recording and blue dress lady's happiness went down completely, it took me out of making a coffee midway through and remained there for a couple seconds where i'm guessing a dialogue would've appeared, but it didn't and blue dress lady simply left and it took me back to making a coffee. additionally, i had the heartistry cuppy running for the order i got (two of my three lattes should have vanilla syrup, seen at the end of the video) but when it took me back to making a coffee after blue dress lady's happiness ran out, cuppy was deactivated even though i was still making lattes. 

lastly, after blue dress lady left, it did spawn another customer even though a customer was there already, and the happiness meter kept being buggy. this new customer that was spawned didn't say anything before i was taken back to making a coffee. at that point, i just restarted the day.

It's been a while since I've had this problem, and I really don't know what to do, so I'd appreciate it if any of you could share a similar experience or have any idea of what is going on.

The problem is 2: 1) Almost two years ago, I stopped masturbating. Even before definitely stopping it, there were times when I wouldn't do it for one week, but then would have nocturnal pollution, these ""wet dreams"", and wake up ""dirty"". When I stopped fapping, I thought I would have this problem for maybe a couple of months, but it still happens, even 2 years later.

2) I don't remember when it started, but it's common to at least once a week pee myself while sleeping. It's not a lot, just enough to wake me up and make me change my clothes, but it's very annoying anyway. There was even one time when I was in an Airbnb, and I really peed myself completely. I spent the whole night trying to clean it with water and soap, and in the morning, I had to spill coffee on it, so I could ask the owner to wash it without being too embarrassed. All of this is so stressful.

I'm really concerned about it happening if I'm sleeping with someone, either on my bed or in the room with me.

I don't have any trauma, neither sexual nor any other kind. I have a quite normal life, no bad experiences with anything related to it, and that makes it even more intriguing to me. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Can you give me some advice?",1,1751010374.0,Advice,4,0.67,False

The International Criminal Court had summoned him for crimes committed during the Philippine drug war. Expecting interrogation, condemnation, and shackles, he wore his bravado like armor. But what greeted him instead was... a smile.

""Good morning, Mr. Duterte,"" said a tall Dutch woman with silver hair. “Would you like tea or coffee? We also have warm pandesal.”

His brow furrowed. “What kind of trick is this?”

“No trick,” said another lawyer, an African man in a crisp suit. “We believe in dignity. Even for those accused.”

Duterte scoffed. “You think soft hands will undo what I did?”

The lawyers didn’t flinch. They simply continued — asking questions, not with venom, but with quiet gravity. They showed him photos — not of dead bodies, but of mothers holding photos of sons, daughters, and fathers who disappeared.

One lawyer gave him a letter. It read:

> *“My brother was killed by masked men. We don’t want revenge. We want you to see we were human too.”*

Duterte felt something stir — an ache unfamiliar and unwelcome.

Day after day, the ICC team continued. No harsh words. No screaming. Just stories, names, and faces. They called him “Sir.” They offered him soup when he coughed. They treated him like the man he might have been before the war.

He tried resisting. “You think this kindness will break me? I ordered those hits because the system failed. I was cleaning up!”

But the kindness didn't stop. And that was what broke him.

One evening, alone in his cell, he watched the footage of a 12-year-old boy shot during a raid. The boy’s last words were calling for his nanay.

Duterte sat back. Something inside cracked.

The next day in court, as the judges prepared for more proceedings, Duterte stood up.

“I’m guilty.”

Gasps echoed through the courtroom.

“I’m guilty of murder. Of cruelty. Of forgetting people were people. I thought fear made peace. But it only made ghosts.”

The courtroom was silent. One ICC lawyer — the same woman with silver hair — nodded, not with triumph, but quiet sadness.

Duterte looked at her. “You should have screamed at me. Spit at me.”

She replied softly, “That would have made you comfortable.”

And with that, Rodrigo Duterte lowered his head — not to the judgment of men, but to the weight of what he had become. And what, perhaps, he still could be.

Think about it this way: these YouTubers are like drug dealers. They've identified a ""product"" (in this case, Mindseye's videos) that they can link to something their ""customers"" (GTA fans) love. They know that by creating a buzz and stirring up controversy, they can get their customers hooked and coming back for more. And just like drug dealers, they're in it for the profit—views, subscriptions, and ad revenue. They'll sell whatever they can to make a profit, and they don't give a shit if it's true or not.

  
So, what's the takeaway here? We're being played. These YouTubers are exploiting your love for GTA to drive their own success. They're taking something that had nothing to do with the game and forcing a connection, all to keep you watching and engaging. And while there's nothing wrong with making a living off YouTube, it's important to recognize when we're being manipulated.

  
I'm not here to praise these YouTubers for their ""clever"" strategies or their ""entertaining"" content. I'm here to call them out on their bullshit. They're manipulating our love for the game, and we're letting them get away with it. It's time we woke up and smelled the coffee, folks. These guys are no different from any other media outlet looking to make a quick buck off controversy and drama.

1llnuj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1llnuj8/narcissm_and_infidelity/,narcissm and infidelity,"* narcissim ⬆️

what were signs in the beginning of your relationship you overlooked and gave your ex narc partner the benefit of the doubt that later ended up being one if not THE reason you left? 

these are some things i noticed lmk if any of these align with yours too!
 
*gay male relationship* 

ONE: white lies: 

- day we met: he lied about his age. subtracted like 3 yrs and later confessed. reason for lying shame of being older than me. i thought it was harmless. 
- confessed to me while we were talking, he went out with a friend got super drunk and blacked out and woke up to his friend giving him oral. the way he set up the story made me believe he got sexually assaulted, i felt bad and offered support services though i felt something slightly off a bit but then again, i wanted to hold space for them after going through something i thought was traumatic 
- while we were together: found anti hiv pills or hiv prevention pills in his luggage after unpacking from a trip. the pills were under some other guys name. called him immediately. his reason for not telling me: he felt super paranoid about the encounter he had months back and wanted to be safe. his friend was able to get the pills since his insurance would not cover. 

TWO: the crazy ex: 
- his ex cheated on him apparently. he ended it. claimed his ex always showed up and stalked him. the ex made claims that he was a narcissist and controlling. 
- when we were talking: ex showed up at his place asking to see him he declined
- when we were still talking: his ex showed up at his place again, he decides to talk to him to give him closure. his ex: “do you really love him??”. my response: are you stuck on ex? or what?! cause we can end this here now. i stayed cause he really had ended things and the ex was crazy

THREE: extreme jealousy and projecting suspected cheating:
- while we were together: my car broke down, had important trip to see family for party, i was the decorator so i was DIying so many things while mechanic (who he sent to my house) worked outside on car. i took a few minutes to respond as i was painting. he called me full blown tantrum “ dont you get the hint, i was texting you more than usual to see of you’d respond fast but you didn’t! im your partner you’re supposed to do these things”. he thought that my delayed responses were due to me getting it on with his mechanic. he screamed on me over the phone something i never witnessed, im so stressed cause of my car, the party, and finances for this expensive fix and on top this jealousy?? i told him what i was actually doing, i am not to be controlled , i ended it with him and hung up (should have ended it here”


FOUR: silent treatment:
- when mad over small things (ex: forgetting to pass for his coffee, forgetting to bring a pen to the coffee shop, wanting to go back to my home after spending 3 consecutive days together) 
- when mad he would smile laugh and have conversations with those around me then turn around and look at me as if he didnt know who i was, completely invisible. he would never ever say what bothered him until i begged him to know what he was feeling. he would do this alot and infront of my family; i had to keep face and left the dinner table cause i was about to burst into tears and didnt want my fam to see (my mom saw this, asked me if i was ok later i said i was, she felt slightly off about it but believed i was ok) 

FIVE: testing loyalty: 
- he called, his car would not turn on (he lived 1:30 mins away from me), i said i could be there as fast as i could. he said dont worry dont do the drive yet he’s got it and will ask neighbor next door. im at home just waiting to see what happens and ready to go if anything. he calls me “where are you? i thought you’d be in your way here already? why are you not here ???” “see i was teying to see if you’d actually come but clearly that’s not the case”
- he would text he was in crisis (saying he was questioning our relationship) whenever i was with my friends (women) who were visiting from back home. me ofc worried about him id abandon my friend and go tend to him. i stopped doing thid later on and drew a boundary that he cant do that instead wait till in person, he’d crossed that boundary again 

anyways he ended up cheating on me with his fwb from the past. 


what happened then? 

ONE: he lied.
TWO: he was the crazy ex. after his cowardly infidelity confession over text (amazing) i blocked him and changed my number—oh did this set him off. he was starving for a reaction from me, he called me from blocked numbers, texted my mom, called me from his moms, sisters, nieces phone, showed up at my house, showed up at my job. yet his ex was the crazy one? 
THREE: he was incapable of NOT controlling himself with other men, he’d just accidentally under the influence would get involved with another man, out of his control, he wad assaulted … again 😱😱😱😱
FOUR: silent treatment was a way to withold any communication and especially affection to have me on his knees begging for him and apologizing to him. it was his way to soothe his ego and maintain emotional control over me
FIVE: he said his cheating was a “test” to our relationship and no relationship is solid without a good fight and facing the darkest parts if ourselves. clearly, his loyalty was tested, and he failed MISERABLY


its astonishing how incompetent these individuals are. i cringe at the fact that i had to deal with that but also hold space for myself cause that was definitely not the stable relationship i thought we had and “minor” issues i thought were normal relationships issues. not normal at all especially to this degree. idk ya’ll but i think narcissm is demonic. the effects of a relationship like this is something im still healing from. he had been blocked and no contact for 2 months though he still spams my email (will be deleting it soon waiting on important emails). im confident in my decision to leave. i dont regret not leaving sooner. finding out about his infidelity for me, it was as if he died. whoever i fell in love with is gone and whoever is the imposter in his flesh, is a demon.

I want to talk to you, really talk to you —past the polite pleasantries— and just have a real conversation for once. But every time, your walls seem to grow higher and higher, and I want to understand why. 

I want to know you, despite the distances. I want to know what you do at the end of the day, what you enjoy, whether you prefer tea or coffee. I want to hear about your problems and what you did for fun last weekend. I want to know your favorite movie and your childhood memories. I want to talk of love and want, of dreams and pain, to flirt and laugh as we grow closer if you are willing to. 

I feel this raw need in my heart to know you, and I can’t keep waiting. Was it all in my head? Should I just be direct and tell you what I want from you? What do you think I want? Do you want it too? Would you reply then? Or would it be your last reply?

I’ve been using a moka pot for several years and I love coffee, so I’ve decided to get a bit more “in” to it (having previously delayed this because, well: coffee bros). First step: learning tips and tricks for moka pots, hence why I’m here! 

I have a 3 cup bialetti and a 1 cup pezzetti and I’m wondering how best to give them some tlc? 

I only clean them with hot water (except when I left the pezz at a friends house and she put it IN THE DISHWASHER), and the bialetti has just had its 2nd gasket replacement in about 4 years. Pezz is only about a year old so nothing replaced.

So:
Am I due a basket replacement?
Should I try and get rid of the couple of dark spots that have appeared inside the bialetti which might be rust? If so, how?
Are there any other bits you replace that I don’t know about?!

Hey, AiContentAutomators family! 🎉 

Ever had that moment where you’re scrolling through your feed, and you come across a headline that screams, “**OMG, AI is taking over EVERYTHING!**”? I know I have! 😱 It’s like every day there’s a new tool or trend that makes you feel like you’re one step away from obsolescence. 

Let's be real: *It’s a wild world out there.* And while I can’t predict the future, one thing’s for sure – if you’re not evolving, you’re heading for the danger zone. So, how do we keep our heads above water? Cue the *upskilling*!

Here are a few thoughts on how to stay ahead of the curve (and maybe have a little fun while doing it):

1. **Stay Curious** 🤔  
   - In a world flooded with information, curiosity is your best friend. Dive into online courses, webinars, and YouTube tutorials. There’s a treasure trove of knowledge waiting just one click away. 

2. **Embrace AI Tools** 🤖  
   - Instead of fearing the bots, learn to befriend them! Tools like ChatGPT and Jasper can empower your creativity. Imagine writing your next blog while sipping coffee – *that’s the dream, right?* Plus, knowing how to use these tools can set you apart in the job market!

3. **Networking is Key** 🤝  
   - Remember, it’s not just about what you know, but also *who you know.* Join online communities, attend virtual meet-ups, or just slide into someone’s DMs who’s doing cool stuff in AI. You never know – that connection could lead to your next big gig! 

4. **Get Practical** 📚  
   - Knowledge is great, but applying it is where the magic happens. Look for projects or challenges that you can join. Build a portfolio. Show future employers you can *actually* implement what you learn. 

5. **Keep It Fun** 🎮  
   - Learning doesn’t have to be boring! Play around with AI-driven platforms or gamified learning apps. Who says upgrading your skills can’t be entertaining?

And since we’re all about leveling up, I recently stumbled upon this awesome educational program: [Imagine Education AI](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). It’s designed to help you harness the power of AI and boost your career. Seriously, check it out if you want to supercharge your skills!

So, here’s the deal: The world is changing FAST. If we want to thrive, we’ve got to keep up, keep learning, and keep sharing. But also, let’s remember to support each other in this journey. We’re all in this together, right? 

What’s the last skill you learned that blew your mind? Or maybe you’ve got a favorite go-to resource that keeps you ahead of the game? Let’s keep the convo going! ✨",1,1751009099.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1llnr2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepThisInMind/comments/1llnr2t/travel_essentials_you_didnt_know_you_needed/,Travel Essentials You Didn’t Know You Needed,"Packing for a trip is always a balancing act. We naturally think of the basics- passport, phone charger, comfy shoes but the real travel pros know that the little unexpected items can make or break your experience. These are the things you won’t find on most packing lists but that seasoned travellers swear by.

Why? Because travelling is full of surprises, and these essentials help you solve problems before they start, save time, and keep you comfortable no matter where you go.

Here are some underrated travel essentials that might just change the way you pack forever:

**1. Portable Lint Roller**

A tiny lint roller fits easily in your bag but makes a huge difference. Whether you’re rushing from the plane to a meeting or want to look photo-ready on the fly, this simple tool keeps your clothes fresh and wrinkle-free. Bonus: it works on pet hair, dust, and crumbs, too!

**2. Reusable Silicone Travel Bottles**

Forget about bulky plastic containers that leak or don’t meet TSA regulations. Silicone travel bottles are leak-proof, flexible, and easy to refill. They’re also environmentally friendly and come in all sizes to fit your favourite shampoo, lotion, or sunscreen without wasting space.

**3. Compact First Aid Kit**

Travel mishaps happen. Whether it’s a blister, a headache, or a minor cut, having a compact first aid kit with band-aids, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, and allergy meds can save the day especially when you’re in a new city or country far from a pharmacy.

**4. Travel-Sized Laundry Detergent**

When you’re on a long trip, spilling coffee or simply running out of clean clothes is inevitable. A small pack of travel detergent lets you hand-wash essentials in your hotel sink and dry them overnight. This hack saves luggage space and money on extra clothes.

**5. Power Bank with Multiple Ports**

In today’s connected world, keeping devices charged is a priority. A power bank with multiple USB ports means you can charge your phone, tablet, and headphones all at once, avoiding the dreaded “out of battery” moments—especially when outlets are scarce.

**Bonus Tip: Collapsible Reusable Bag**

This lightweight, foldable bag is perfect for impromptu grocery runs, carrying souvenirs, or even separating dirty laundry. It’s eco-friendly and can replace single-use plastic bags, making it a smart addition to any traveler’s gear.

**Why do these small items matter so much?**  
Because travel is unpredictable. Weather changes, delays happen, and sometimes your luggage goes missing. Having these smart essentials means you’re ready for most curveballs, making your trip smoother and less stressful. 

**What’s your secret travel essential that never leaves your bag?**  
Whether it’s a quirky gadget, a personal comfort item, or a clever hack, share it with us below! Let’s build the ultimate, crowd-sourced packing list.",1,1751009011.0,KeepThisInMind,0,1.0,False

1llnl5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1llnl5x/rating_every_nootropic_ive_taken/,Rating every nootropic I've taken,"Starting with some background. I've been into nootropics for about 1-2 years now and have tried a good variety of compounds ranging from herbs to prescription drugs. I'm neurotypical as far as I know, male in my early 20s, and am currently finishing my third year of engineering school. 


On top of these supplements, I also work out 5-6 days per week, try to sleep at a consistent time for ~7-8 hours per night and eat a clean diet avoiding added sugar and seed oils when possible. These actions have had more impact than almost any supplement  or drug. Anyone looking into cognitive enhancement should start here before adding new compounds. 


Anyways, here's the list, broken down into categories, and roughly scored out of ten. Some of these may not be legal in all areas. Check your local laws and don't purchase/consume anything that could put you in prison.


**Vitamins/minerals:**

**Magnesium** (9/10): biggest impact of any mineral I've taken. I was likely deficient in this as after starting it I noticed an almost immediate boost in sleep quality and started dreaming again after barely having any dreams for a few years. Also helped reduce muscle cramping and soreness. 

**Fish oil Omega 3** (6/10): I've heard this is healthy and everyone should take it, but to be honest I haven't noticed much personally from it. Whether it's the supplements not doing much, or the fact that I've already tried to cut Omega 6 fats out if my diet to have a balanced ratio of Omega 3-6 I don't know, but these didn't work as well as I've heard. I still take it due to the mountains if evidence supporting fish oil and the fact that I can get a years supply for $20. 

**Zinc** (8/10): like magnesium this also had a noticable effect on my sleep quality and dreams but not as significant. I've heard it can boost testosterone, and I did notice a transient boost in libido when starting zinc, but haven't had much long term impact. 

**Vitamin D** (9/10): I live in Canada so vitamin d deficiency is extremely common, especially in the winter. I've had seasonal depression since I was roughly ten, and after supplementing 5000IU/day 2 years ago, it's stopped completely. For that alone this supplement is worth taking, and more evidence about it's benefits keeps coming out, would highly recommend this. 

**B12** (4/10): didn't notice much from this despite it being recommend to me by some friends. I likely get more than enough B12 from my diet, so the supplement didn't do much. Take this if you're vegan, but no point if you're not. 


**Herbal supplements**

**L theanine** (9/10): non-addictive anxiety relief and takes the anxious irritable edge off of every stimulant. I've been taking this daily for about 3 years now and it works as well as it did the first time. Good addition to any nootropic stack.

**Caffeine/coffee** (9.5/10): first ""smart-drug"" I've taken and still one of my favorites. I usually have 2 cups of coffee a day, one in the morning and one after lunch. Boosts energy and motivation while giving me a good morning ritual. Only problem is the addiction and tolerance issues, to remedy I try to take a week off caffeine every 2-4 months. 

**Lion's mane** (5/10): felt a slight boost in cognition, but minimal compared to racetams. I also noticed a significant drop in libido while taking lion's mane which scared me off. Benefits weren't worth the side effects for me sadly. 

**Cordyceps** (7/10): another mushroom and one that did work well for me. Slight boost to energy and a decent boost to stamina. I used this more as a workout than nootropic supplement, but it increased energy and drive for either task. 

**Saffron** (7/10): yes the expensive spice. I'd make a tea with about 100mg of it and noticed a decent drop in anxiety and mood boost. Similar effects to theanine, but too pricy to use regularly.

**Ashwaghanda** (4/10): I've tried this multiple times and never noticed anything (good or bad) from it. 

**Kava-kava** (6/10): feels more recreational than nootropic. Gave me a euphoric, disinhibited mental state for about 2 hours after consumption. More of a social drug like alcohol or cannabis than a nootropic. 

**Coca leaf** (6/10): the plant cocaine is made from. A tea from these leaves provides a stimulating effect similar to a cup of coffee but only lasts 2 hours. Nice if you want to work later in the evening. Feels a little harder on my heart than caffeine and other similar stimulants, so I try not to use it often. 


**Synthetic supplements**

**Noopept** (8/10): my favourite racetam. I typically take 2-4mg in a nasal spray and notice an immediate boost to energy, working memory and mental processing speed. Synergizes well with almost all other compounds (except LSD) and I've had little issues with tolerance. 

**Pramiracetam** (2/10): tried this 3-4 times. Each time I had a headache, nausea and fatigue from consuming it. Don't know if it was a bad batch or my body doesn't like this, but I threw it out due to the awful effects. 

**Oxiracetam** (6/10): another racetam, more subtle than noopept but similar effects. Taken orally and takes about 40-60 mins to feel it, so I prefer the instant effects of nasally administered noopept. 

**Phenylpiracetam** (7/10): more of a stimulant than a racetam. Great preworkout, but only lasts about 3 hours so not ideal for work. Also expensive so I prefer to use the less pricy noopet. 

**L tyrosine** (7/10): minimal effects on its own but helps a lot when I'm dealing with ""dopamine depletion"" after using stronger stimulants. 1g on an empty stomach seems to end the comedowns of harsher stimulants. 

**Ephedrine** (7/10): stronger than caffeine and dirtier feeling as a stimulant. Amazing to work out on and good for work as well. Can make me angry if taken too often, but is very useful. Doesn't build tolerance as quickly as other stimulants.

**Melatonin** (5/10): helps me fall asleep when in a new location or changing sleep schedule. I try not to take it regularly due to becoming dependant on it in the last. Doesn't seem to boost sleep quality, just helps me fall asleep. Would recommend doing quarter milligrams, 1mg and above it's too much intense to stop working  


**Stronger noots/'drugs'**

**Modafinil** (10/10): my favourite nootropic. Wakefulness, increased motivation and increased confidence that lasts all day. Doesn't interrupt my sleep too much and doesn't have a harsh comedown like other stimulants. 

**Amphetamine** (7/10): I've taken both Adderall and Vyvanse and decided to group them together due to similar experiences. Amphetamine gives me a forced motivation feeling and though highly euphoric doesn't produce the same quality or consostancy if output as modafinil. It's good for occasions I need a significant boost of energy, but I avoid taking it regularly due to concerns about addiction and potential long-term negatives.

**Methylphenidate** (6/10): similar speediness to amphetamine, but a more robotic and emotionless feeling. Useful for work but changes my personality in a bad way while I'm on it. 

**MK-677** (7/10): a bodybuilding supplement used to boost growth hormone. Also the single best sleep aid I've take.  Boosts quality of sleep and improves physical recovery while asleep. 6 hours of sleep on this feels like 8 normally. Several side effects though such as increased hunger, significant weight gain and in my case carpal tunnel syndrome. 

**N-methyl-cyclazodone** (8/10): feels similar to Adderall but longer lasting. Not as manic as amphetamine and has lead to a better work output. Research chemical so unknown safety profile, and may be hepatotocix. 

**Psilocybin microdose** (6/10): a more relaxing/social microdose. Can't do work on this one but it helps to balance and boost my mood. One microdose and I feel notably happier while on it as well as for the subsequent days. Heard DMT was the best followed by LSD for microdosing. Anything with psychedelics that isn't a microdose is a risk and is def not nootropic. 

**Nicotine** (7/10): surprisingly useful nootropic drug.  use lozenges/gum to avoid the more addictive and dangerous consumption methods. Lasts about 1-2 hours and feels like a combination of noopept and caffeine. Avoid frequent use due to addictiveness, but useful for a quick boost.

So yeah, thats it. I hope to try some of the newer noots out there, and this list didn't include some other ones that I haven't really had a final opinion on yet. That will come soon. Thank you so much for reading and I hope you gained something from this

So she did the only thing that made sense.,"Blair caught her fiancé in bed with her cousin. So she did the only thing that made sense.

Blair was so thankful to be home. She couldn't comprehend the kind of demon that had possessed her boss during their recent business trip. They had arrived home one day earlier than planned, but she was glad to be away from him. She was surprised that he hadn't wanted her to return to the office with him. Instead, giving her the rest of the afternoon off.

He was being a real toad. When he had dropped her off at her front door, she had really felt like flipping him the bird. But stilled her hand at the last moment in case he looked back in the rear-view mirror. He did seem to have eyes in the back of his head most of the time. Being gorgeous hadn't improved his disposition. If anything, it made him more of an wrech.

She didn't know what was going on. Roman seemed more irritable and on her part, he had been rubbing her the wrong way. Of the two years she had worked for him, these last two months were the worst. If he didn't pay her so well… maybe she would tell him where to go. Blair gave a shake to her head. No, that wasn't true. Roman did look after his staff.

Picking up her case. She headed to the front door of the three-bedroom townhouse she shared with her cousin Laura and her fiance Dan.

Blair checked her watch. Dan wouldn't be home for a few hours yet. She was going to surprise him with a romantic dinner. India was rarely home at night. Always out somewhere, partying with someone. Her cousin was a model. Not a supermodel or anything. But she was gorgeous. She knew how to make the most of it as well. Blair had never been interested in clothes or makeup. More interested in books.

They had both moved to the city for different reasons. Laura to follow her modeling career and for Blair, it had been a chance to work for a great company like Kingston Industries. Under normally the great man himself Roman Kingston. The company had their fingers in so many pies, Blair was never bored. Even when Roman was being his most demanding. She loved her job.

Fishing for her keys. She juggled her briefcase, handbag, and suitcase. Once the key was in the lock, it turned easily. Blair pushed the door open. Stepping inside, Blair put her handbag and suitcase down at the end of the stairs. Before heading into the lounge room where she kept a desk. Sitting her briefcase on top.

Blair turned to make her way to the kitchen, pondering what to prepare for dinner. As she walked past the foot of the stairs, a sudden noise from upstairs caused her to halt in her tracks. Was there someone else in the house? Had she returned home to an intruder? Filled with panic, Blair took a step towards the front door, ready to flee.

However, at that moment, she realized something. Laura. Unlike Blair and Dan, Laura didn't adhere to their typical working hours. She often slept late and stayed out until the early hours of the morning. It wasn't the first time Blair had found her slumped on the front steps as she was leaving for work in the morning. Blair wasn't sure if she should call out now. What if it wasn't her cousin?

Looking around for a weapon just in case it was an intruder and not India. Blair saw her late father's baseball bat she had always kept near the front door just in case she was home alone at night. Having the thing around made her feel safer.

Picking it up, Blair weighted the bat. Before she put her first foot on the stairs. Did any of them creak? She couldn't remember. Taking a deep breath to steady her heartbeat, Blair took one step at a time. Creeping up the stairs. When she reached the landing, she paused to listen.

Saying under her breath. ""Please be Laura, please be Laura and not some masked man waiting to jump out at me.""

The hallway only went in one direction. There were four doors up here. Three for the bedroom and one for the shared bathroom. The only door ajar was the one to Dan and her bedroom. The rest were closed. But she would have to walk past the other doors to get to the master bedroom.

It was then she heard Laura giggle and then a very male voice. She felt relief. It wasn't a burglar. Instead, it sounded like her cousin had brought someone home. She was about to turn away and leave when she heard the voice of the male Laura was with. ""God, yes.""

""No, it can't be. He wouldn't."" Blair said in an almost silent whisper. He wouldn't do this to her. He couldn't.

""Laura, you are so hot."" Dan's voice came from their bedroom.

Blair's eyes widened. He was in bed with Laura in their bedroom. Blair moved quietly down the hallway until she was standing outside her bedroom. Praying that this would be some huge misunderstanding.

Blair braced herself for what she might see once she pushed the door open. Lifting a trembling hand to touch the wood of the door, she pushed it open carefully. The sight that greeted her was like a physical blow, causing her to take a step back.

There in the middle of her bed was Dan laying flat on his back with a very balled Laura riding him. Laura had her hands threaded through his body hair as she lifted her body up and down on his shaft. From this angle, she could see Dan's equipment pushing in and out of her body. It was like watching an adult movie. Blair had never seen anyone doing this before.

Dan gripped Laura's waist with one hand and the other held her lap. Guiding India's movements.

""Err. Yes, do me harder."" Laura cried.

Blair lifted a hand to cover her mouth. As she watched, Dan's grip tightened on Laura's lap, spreading her cheeks wider.

Blair had never seen Laura like this before. Not like that truly mattered when she was currently sleeping with her fiance.

Blair wasn't sure how Laura could do this to her. They had both watched Laura's father cheat repeatedly on his wife. Creating a toxic environment in their home. The home she had shared with her cousin's family when her own parents had died in a plane crash ten years ago when Blair had been just thirteen. She had thought if anyone would have the same views on faithfulness, it would be India after they had watched her mother suffer every time her cheating father got caught with his pants down.

This had to be a dream. Blair pinched herself to make sure she wasn't having a nightmare. When the sting of the pinch registered to her brain, Blair knew this was no nightmare.

Which didn't make sense. Dan hated India, had always hated Laura. They had all come from the same town. Their families knew each other. They had grown up together.

Dan had often called Laura a bad girl and commented on her choice of clothing. How she was shallow, and she didn't know how to hold a conversation.

Now standing here witnessing them together, was it all a lie? Was he jealous of the men in Laura's life? Was that why?

\`One thing she was sure of, Dan's mum, Paula, would never accept Laura as a suitable wife for her son.

So what was she to do now? She had no clue. How did someone manage a scenario like this? It was like a B-grade movie.

She couldn't pretend like this had never happened. She didn't want him. Not now. Not after this. There was just something wrong with a woman taking a man back after something like this. Just the thought made her feel unclean.

How long had this been happening? They had been living together for the past five months, ever since Dan moved in with her and Laura. They had decided to combine their living arrangements to cut down on expenses and save up for a house once they got married.

""Laura, you are so tight."" Dan yalled as he arched his back.

""Is me better than Blair?"" Laura asked, pumping harder over Dan's body.

Did she know Blair was standing here witnessing this? Was that why she had asked the question? Blair bit into her hand to stop from crying out. She had given her first love to this man, and he was cheating on her. He had known how she would feel if she ever found out.

She hadn't planned on being home until tomorrow. She had wanted to surprise Dan tonight. So she hadn't called to let him know.

The surprise had been on her. She wanted to vomit. Blair could feel the cold sweat bead on her skin. This was… horrible. What did she do?

Blair started to lift her other hand to grip the doorframe to keep herself upright. Believing her legs might do out from under her. But as her hand came up, she felt something in her hand, remembering she was still holding her father's old baseball bat. Although she felt like using this on them, she couldn't even with the pain coursing through her body. It wasn't just the betrayal of her fiance that was bad enough this was her cousin. Someone she had trusted. But she couldn't physically harm anyone, it just wasn't in her.

So what now? Should she just leave and go to a motel because she wasn't going to sleep in that bed ever again? She would burn it. There was no way to unsee this. There was no unwinding the clock. So she needed to face it.

Taking her hand away from her face, Blair straightened her spine and let the hurt and anger drive her to do what needed doing.

""While you two finish up, should I cook dinner?""

Chapter Two

""Do me."" Dan's head came up off the bed as he pushed Laura off his body. Blair could see the horror on his face when he saw her standing at the door. He had been caught with his pants down, or off, as it was in this case. Laura scrambled across the bed, pulling a blanket over her glossy body. Her face was filled with shock, showing her cousin hadn't known of Blair's presence. The expression she wore was incredibly real and impossible to fake.

""No thanks. Looks like Laura has taken care of that for you."" Blair was surprised how calm she sounded. When all she truly wanted to do was scream and shout and throw things. What would it accomplish? She would still have a broken relationship.

""Blair! What are you doing home today?"" Dan's thing was wet and laying limp against his leg. Having his fiance walk in on him mustn't be a turn on, it would seem.

Blair lifted an eyebrow at him. ""That's what you are worried about? Might be an idea to cover up.""

Blair was watching Dan with narrowed eyes. She had loved him. The person she saw now was vicious. It didn't matter anymore that he was very attractive. To her, he was immoral. No one should cheat on someone they loved. Even if someone had held a gun to her head, she would have refused. It was a shame Dan hadn't felt the same. As far as she could see, Laura hadn't needed to force him. Hearing them talk during the act had told her that.

Blair put the bat down, resting it against the wall near the door. Just in case. She told herself that she wouldn't use it, but who knew? Crimes that had to have come from somewhere. Normal everyday people committing a crime in the heat of the moment. So it was safer if she put it down. Blair then crossed her arms. Looking back to see Dan had gotten off the bed and was pulling on his work pants.

She flicked her eyes to Laura. Laura now had a smug look on her face. It had replaced the look of shock. Why?

Blood was roaring in her ears as she came to terms with the total destruction of her personal life. She never wanted to see him again, but she and Dan both worked for Kingston. She had applied first. Dan hadn't joined the company until a year later.

Blair decided then and there she would not be leaving her job. It was her only concrete thing she could hang onto, then she was keeping it. It wasn't like they work directly together.

Dan took a step towards her, reaching out his hand. ""Baby..""

Blair took a step back. ""Don't you dare touch me?"" Not only could she not stomach it, but who knows where that hand had been?

The venom in Blair's voice brought him up short. He turned to look at Laura before returning his eyes to her face. Blair knew she was pale. Who wouldn't be?

""You have to believe me. This was a onetime thing. It will never happen again. It meant nothing."" Dan pleaded with her.

Blair could see the look on Laura's face. Even before seeing it, she knew he was lying. Dan had a tell. When he lied, his right eyebrow would go up. Before today, the lies had never been big, just little things. Had she noticed it when he had talked about Laura in the past? Blair wasn't sure. Because sometimes the sub-conscious mind could even fool ourselves.

""Do you know Dan? It doesn't matter."" Blair angled her chin up as her nails dug into her palm. ""This one time was all it took.""

""What.. No, Blair baby please, I love you."" Dan tried to take her in his arms.

Blair moved quickly, picked up the bat, and swung it so the end pressed up against his pectorales, pushing him back and holding him at bay. ""Don't even think about it.""

Dan looked down at the bat, raising his hands back at his shoulder level. ""Please, she seduced me. You know what a person she is. I was missing you.""

They both heard the gasp from the bed. Before Laura responded. ""He's lying Blair. This has been going on for months. Soon after, he moved in.""

""Shut up, you dumb head."" Dan turned to yell at her. Before saying to Blair. ""She is lying.""

Blair shrugged. ""Doesn't matter. It only took the one time Dan."" She nudged him with the baseball bat. ""Don't call Laura a dumb head. I may never forgive her for this, but you were the one in a relationship, Dan, not her."" Blair could see Laura sliding out of the bed, scrambling around for her clothing, still holding the sheet to her body. ""If you think she is a dumb head, what does that make you?"" Blair knew she would not feel clean even if she had ten showers. This was going to take time.

Blair knew she couldn't bear anymore right now. She needed to leave before they were both dressed. She needed to think, to process. Turning on her heel, she ran down the stairs. Quickly grabbing the suitcase, handbag. Blair only just remembered the briefcase as she was about to leave through the front door.

""Why did you have to say anything?"" Dan's angry voice came from upstairs

Blair rushed to her desk, picked up the briefcase and stood at the front door, ready to leave. Knowing once she walked through it, she wasn't coming back. She had no idea where she was going, but anywhere was better than here.

Following Dan's insult came Laura's high-pitched squeal. ""I'm not dumb Dan.""

""You and your big mouth. You wanted this to happen, didn't you?"" Dan accused.

Blair could hear the tears in Laura's voice. ""You didn't mind my mouth when it was on your lap.""

""Shh."" Dan was worried she was hearing their argument. ""You set me up, didn't you? You knew she was coming home.""

""Dan I didn't know."" Laura cried.

If she stayed any longer, both of them would have gotten dressed and then they would come down here, and she didn't want another confrontation.

Taking a deep breath, Blair stepped through the front door, ignoring Dan calling her name from inside the house.

Chapter Three

Blair waved down a taxi. She shoved open the taxi door and climbed into the backseat as quickly as she could, intent on getting out of here as fast as possible. She felt like getting drunk. But if she went to a bar alone during the day, that would be inviting trouble. She could feel the tears as they slid unchecked down her face. She had held herself together while she had confronted Dan and Laura.

""Where to?"" the driver asked, his voice cutting through the fog in her brain.

Where to? Good question.

Home wasn't an option. Sutton and Keira were at work, and she didn't want to sit in their empty apartment, replaying the image of Dan tangled in her cousin's sheets. She needed a drink. But sitting alone in a bar in the middle of the afternoon? That felt like waving a white flag.

She hesitated, then rattled off the address of her office. At least there, she could pretend to be productive. Maybe even figure out what to do next.

The taxi pulled away from the kerb and she exhaled, trying to steady herself.

The driver looked at her in the rearview mirror. ""There are tissues in the center compartment if you need them, hon.""

The driver's voice was gentle, like he'd seen enough women cry in his backseat to know when to speak and when to keep quiet.

Blair grabbed a handful. ""Thanks."" She said before cleaning her face as best she could. It wasn't like she wore a lot of makeup. So she might as well clean her face.

Her phone began to ring. Dan.

She still pulled it out of her to check. Her stomach clenched as she stared at the screen, his name glowing in bright white letters.

She could just imagine the first words he would say.

""It's not what it looks like, Blair.""

""I can explain.""

""Please, just let me talk to you.""

Lies. Excuses. The same words men always spewed when they got caught.

She set the phone to silent and shoved it back into her bag.

By the time the taxi pulled up in front of the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries, her makeup was beyond saving. She reached into her purse, dug out a crumpled twenty, and handed it to the driver.

""Be honest,"" she said, forcing a smile. ""Do I look like a woman who just found out her fiancé is screwing her cousin?""

The driver hesitated, giving her a careful once-over. ""Your eyes are a little red, honey, but it's hardly noticeable."" He paused. ""Are you going to be okay?""

The unexpected kindness nearly undid her.

She swallowed the lump in her throat and nodded. ""Yeah. Better to find out now, right? Just a little dump on the road of life."" She wasn't sure who she was trying to convince the taxi driver or herself.

After paying the driver in cash, she climbed out of the taxi, hoisted her suitcase onto the curb and took a deep breath. Blair checked her phone screen to see Dan had called her six times and left six messages on her voicemail. Uninterested in what he had to say for himself, she slid the phone away in her handbag.

Blair turned toward the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries. Roman had bought the building five years ago. The top eight floors belonged to Kingston, the lower three rented out to smaller businesses. With the way the company was expanding, she wouldn't be surprised if they took over the whole thing eventually.

She walked inside, adjusting her bag on her shoulder.

""Miss Warner, Can I help you?"" Blair blinked. Maggie, one of the receptionists, had stepped out from behind the lobby front desk, her gaze flicking over Blair.

Maggie stepped forward, taking the suitcase from her. In the same hand, she was still holding the bat. Blair had completely forgotten that she was even holding it in her hand.

Blair had walked into the office looking like she was about to commit a felony. She was relieved, though. It was something she wouldn't need to retrieve later.

Blair exhaled, relieved. ""Thanks, Maggie. Can I leave everything here while I freshen up?"" She was surprised her voice sounded so... normal.

""Of course, Miss Warner."" Maggie's eyes darted to the bat again.

""Blair, please. How many times do I have to tell you?"" Roman preferred first names, but some staff-especially the newer ones-struggled with that.

More with Roman than with her.

Maggie smiled, taking the suitcase, briefcase, and bat.

Blair headed across the foyer to the restroom.

Inside, she went straight to the mirrors. The cab driver hadn't just been kind. She really didn't look that bad. She pulled a makeup wipe from her bag and cleaned off the last remnants of mascara. A quick dusting of powder, some mouth gloss, a little eyeliner.

She pinched her cheeks. People always said that added color, but she didn't see a difference.

Her blue eyes were still a little red, but there wasn't much she could do about that. She pulled out a brush, comb her long, wavy blonde hair from its bun, and redid it neatly. Good enough.

She left the restroom, retrieved her belongings from Maggie, and headed to the elevators. As she waited, she tried to recall Roman's schedule. Did he have any meetings this afternoon?

Then it hit her. He shouldn't have been home today. So no meetings were scheduled in his calendar.

She sighed. Her brain was fried. But walking in on your fiancé shagging your cousin would do that to anyone.

The thought made her frown.

How often had they been doing this? Dan had been at home during a workday. She traveled occasionally for work, but not that often. If their affair had been going on for months, they had to have been meeting up on company time.

The elevator arrived. A woman she didn't recognize stepped in with her.

Blair offered a polite, strained smile. When the woman got off at the second floor, Blair leaned back against the wall, staring at nothing.

Should she tell Roman about Dan? It would feel like sour grapes-tattling just because he cheated. But he was also ripping off the company. No way could he get home, sleep with Laura, and get back to the office during a lunch break.

The elevator dinged open. Blair inhaled deeply before stepping onto the executive floor.

Kara, the receptionist on the executive floor, looked up. ""Hey, Blair. I didn't think you'd be in today.""

Blair smiled. ""Wasn't planning to be, but I figured I'd get a jump on the meeting notes for Roman. Is he in?""

Kara shook her head. ""No, he left a little while ago. Called to have his calls held.""

Blair almost sagged in relief. She wouldn't have to face him just yet.

""Thanks, Kara.""

She went to her office, shut the door, and sank into her chair.

Blair rested her head on the desk. She felt like a wrecking ball had just split her world in two.

How could he? But even worse than that, how could Laura?

The childish problems they had all had as kids, Blair had thought, they had grown out of that. Laura had always been spoiled. Taking what wasn't hers.

The problem was her parents, Blair's aunt and uncle, doted on her and gave her everything she wanted. But when they had moved to the city two years ago, Laura hadn't been that bad or by now Blair would have moved in with her sisters. She hadn't when Sutton had come back from Europe because her sister Keira had just finished university. Keira had moved in with Sutton. She would have felt guilty leaving Laura on her own to move in with her sisters. What was the point, anyway? She and Dan had planned on getting a place of their own once they were married.

Lifting her head, Blair looked down at the ring on her finger. The engagement ring Dan had given her.

It wasn't big. She hadn't wanted big. She would make sure he got it back. He could return it. Because she was sure Laura would want a big flashy ring. She had made fun of Blair's ring.

Taking it off, Blair was about to throw it across the room. No, just in case it went missing. Opening the top drawer of her desk, Blair dropped it in, slamming it shut. She needed a drink. Standing, Blair went into Roman's office, where she knew he kept a bottle of scotch. She wasn't much of a spirit drinker, but anything would do.

Roman office was a statement of the man himself. Everything was big, strong, and masculine. ""Don't forget intimidating."" Blair said to the empty room.

Going to his desk, she opened the drawer and pulled out the bottle of scotch that Roman kept there. Taking it, she sat down on his Chestfield lounge near the window. She opened the bottle and took a drink. Almost coughing it back up. ""Holy, this burns."" Blair knew it was an expensive bottle Roman only liked the best.

The problem was, it was straight. Why did he like this straight? This time, when she put the bottle to her mouth, Blair made sure to sip it this time. Nope, that didn't help. But it wasn't as bad as the first drink. So she had another. Laying her head back against the lounge. She had come here to think. What was her next move?

Lifting her hand so she could see the dial on her watch, Blair saw it was 3:15pm. She couldn't call Sutton or Keira. Not yet. Let them get home from work. Blair planned to ask Sutton and Keira to assist her in organizing getting her stuff from the apartment. Although she didn't want to put too much pressure on her older sister, Sutton. She was six months carrying her nephew or niece, and it hadn't been easy.

Men. Why were they being so annoying? First, her boss for being so arrogant and intimidating and sometimes rude. Then Dan, who had been cheating on her with her cousin Laura for months. How low was that? Then there was Luca, the father of Sutton's baby. Who had left her high and dry?

Then she would see about crashing at their place until she could find somewhere. Their place wasn't big enough for three adults and a baby. When it arrived. But it would be great to spend some time with her sisters. Eat ice cream and talk bad words about men.

Although Sutton didn't even talk about the man that had gotten her in touble. It was a topic she refused to discuss. Even when their aunt Viv and uncle Peter had demanded answers. Blair lifted the bottle again to her mouth. Only she and Keira knew his first name.

The phone started ringing on Roman's desk. Blair tried to ignore it, but as soon as it stop ringing it started again. Blair shifted to the edge of the lounge, rising to her feet. The room seemed to tilt ever so slightly, prompting a quick ""Oops."" to escape her mouth.

After regaining her balance, she made her way over to the phone and lifted the receiver.

""Hello?"" she greeted into the handset. Not very professional, she thought.

""Roman please."" Blair knew the voice. It was Claire Robertson. Roman's little piece of fluff. It was the best way to describe Claire. She had this girly voice that set Blair's teeth on edge.

""Roman isn't here."" Blair put a hand on Roman's desk to help stop the swaying of the room.

""Where is he?"" Claire asked.

""How should I know?"" Blaire was surprised by her answer. Where had that come from?

""You are his secretary."" Blair could hear the anger in the other woman's voice.

""Yes, but I'm not his keeper and I sure don't own a crystal ball. Call or message his mobile."" Blair was over this conversation.

""He isn't answering his mobile hasn't for days."" Claire whined.

Blair's mouth parted slightly. Oh.

That was Roman's move. He didn't argue, didn't make dramatic exits. He just started to avoid before making a clean break. If Claire hadn't heard from him in days, it was over. She just didn't know it yet.

The little devil on her shoulder made her do it. But Blair couldn't help the next words. ""Well, one of two things has happened. Either you're about to get dumped, or he's dead. Either way, flowers will be involved.""

Blair sighed when she heard the shocked gasp from the other end of the phone, the scotch warming her veins, and loosening her tongue. ""Look, Claire, let's be honest. He's not marriage material. Find someone new."" She didn't wait for a reply, just hung up and dropped the receiver back into place.

She collapsed back onto the Chesterfield, lifting the bottle to her mouth again.

Her own problems resurfaced to haunt her. How was she so blind? How did she not pick up on the signs? She wasn't an idiot. Dan was a salesman. He had sold her the dream of happily ever after. She had just been blind to the cracks in their relationship.

Not only that, it looked like she had been missing something in her love life. If what she had witnessed between Dan and Laura was any indication of how the act should be. She enjoyed it well enough, but it wasn't something that made her cry out like Laura had been doing. Was that to stroke his ego? Should she have been doing that? The thing was, she didn't know.

Dan had been her only lover. It had been his job to teach her.

Blair sighed, lifting the bottle again-only to pause when she noticed two tall, blurry figures standing in front of her.

Wait. No. Not two. Just one.

Blair squinted. ""Hi.""

She tried to sit up, bringing the bottle to her mouth, but before she could take another sip, it was plucked from her hand.

""Hey,"" she protested. ""That's mine. If you want one, go find your own.""

She blinked, trying to focus.

The man standing in front of her-the one holding the bottle-came into view.

""Roman?""

""Blair,"" he said, his voice unreadable. ""What have you done to yourself?""

""Well,"" she said, slurring slightly, ""I think that's... pretty obvious. As you can see, I'm getting drunk."" She reached for the bottle. ""Now give it back so I can finish the job.""

Roman stepped away, placing the bottle on his desk. ""I think you've had enough.""

Blair frowned. ""You know... sometimes you can be vicous. No-most of the time.""

""I do believe you're going to regret this tomorrow.""

Then, to her surprise, he sat down beside her.

Chapter Four

""You are not just an bad man but a shothead tooo. I always thought soo."" Blair knew the things she was saying could get her in trouble, but she couldn't stop herself.

Roman laughed, saying. ""I think I should get you some coffee.""

""Don't want it. I want a man that isn't a cheatin rat."" Blair looked at Roman. He really was very attractive. ""Did yo ever cheat on your ex wife?"" Blair had met Roman's ex wife Jessica once. The experience hadn't been pleasant.

""Not all men cheat, Blair."" Roman said softly.

""W… why did she leave yo then?"" Blair was interested.

""There are many reasons why a marriage breaks down Blair, not all of them have to do with cheating on the man's part."" Blair watched as Roman whipped a hand across his face.

It took her a moment to register what he had just said. Her mouth fell open. ""She cheated on yo… was shee an idiot."" Her boss was gorgeous, with thick dark hair, the most intense gray eyes she had ever seen. A chiseled face with high cheekbones. He worked out three or four times a week. So his body, from what she could see of it, was fine. Not that she had ever been interested. She had always been with Dan… Had been with Dan. Plus, Blair found Roman masculinity a little overwhelming.

Roman leaned over and pushed her chin up with two fingers before he shrugged. ""I worked a lot. Some would say I drove her to it.""

Blair tilted her head as if considering this. ""Is th.. that really an excuse though…. I..I don't think soo. I would say get a divorce before tha.""

Blair dropped her head back on the Chesterfield. She turned to look at her boss. He settled back next to her, elbow on the back of the chair, head in his hand, watching her.

""You know this is the most I have seen you relax around me,"" Roman said with a small smile on his face.

""Th..That's because nor… normally you are so difficult to get along with."" Blair couldn't help just saying whatever came into her mind, it was like she had no filter. Whatever came into her mind just flowed out of her mouth.

""I will not apologize for that, Blair. I'm fair to my employees. They are treated fairly and I know I'm demanding and impatient, but that's what drives me to get this company where it is today.""

Blair looked at the ceiling. ""I suppose it iss."" Blair said. This was why she didn't drink too much. Control. She was losing it.

""Tell me what happened?"" Roman said when she was quiet for a minute.

Blair rolled her head on the lounge to look at him. ""I was an idiot.""

""Why? Because you put your trust in the wrong place.""

Blair let out her breath. ""Dan and I grew up in the same town. Did you know that?""

""No."" Roman asked.

""I…l was going home all da time when I moved too th city for this job. I was happpy when he applied to work at King…Kingston's. now I wish he wasn't h..here."" Blair would not cry. She had done that in the taxi and she refused to let herself shed another tear for Dan. She was more angry than anything. She had wasted time on someone like Dan.

""So I'm guessing the wedding's off."" Roman pointed to her bare finger.

Blair lifted the hand that once held Dan's ring. Before dropping it back in her lap. ""Yep. I… we lived in a house while growing up… my uncle.. he cheated all the time. It was soo… terrible. Thee fights and ar.. arguing. It was horr… bad.""

""Would you say you are glad you found out now? Before the wedding."" Asked Roman.

Blair nodded. ""We didn't even h… have a… a date set.""

""Who was holding it up?"" Roman inquired.

Blair blinked at him. Why was he being so nice and why all the questions? Roman knew she was engaged. She had always worn the ring since her first interview, and the whole time she had worked at Kingston. But she didn't feel strange without it, which made her frown. ""I was. He wanted to get marr.. married last year. I was.. not ready.""

""Why? If you loved him, why did you want to wait?"" Blair felt like his eyes were boring into her.

Blair gave a drunken shrug. ""I… if what I saw to..today was any indication…"" she paused for a moment, thinking. Maybe she had realized something was wrong with her relationship. She had loved Dan, but maybe not the way she should love the person she was to marry. Right now, she was more angry than upset. Was that normal? She didn't know. Dan had been her first real relationship.

""What? What happened?"" Roman wanted to know.

Blair frowned at him. ""I saw him. H.. having... with... anyway, it wasn't thee same.""

Softly, he asked. ""In what way?""

Blair couldn't talk about it. Not with her boss. ""I don't…"" frowning. Why had it been different? Was it her, or was the problem with Dan? She had no one to compare him with. Dan had been her teacher.

She needed a baseline to find out if it was her. Blair eyed her boss. From what she had seen over the two years, she had worked for him. He had had a long stream of girlfriends. She reached out a hand, picking up his tie. Studying the pattern on his tie for a moment. Would he fire her? Right at this moment, she didn't care. Her emotions were all over the place.

Without another word, Blair closed the gap between them, pulling at his tie so he wouldn't pull away. Capturing him in a kiss that was unsure at first. He was still for a moment as she moved in closer..

Blair gasped into his mouth. The heat was a shock to her.

Her hands flew to his shoulders, gripping the fabric of his shirt as she lost herself in the sensation. This was different… so different from anything she'd ever experienced with Dan. There was a raw intensity in his kiss, a hunger that sent sparks racing through her veins.

Roman pulled back slightly, his breathing ragged as he looked down at her. ""Blair,"" he murmured, his voice hoarse. ""We shouldn't…""

But she cut him off with another kiss as she moved closer, pressing her body against his. ""Please,"" she begged, her voice trembling.

Chapter Five

Her heart pounded. Just by his kiss was enough to tell her there had been something wrong with her relationship. Dan had been the problem all along. She didn't even love Roman. Found him to be all too arrogant. But what she was feeling from just his kiss was more than she had felt with heavy petting when Dan touched her. Blair pulled back to stare at him.

Her boss raised an eyebrow. His expression... Blair was trying to put a word to it. ""Blair, is everything alright?"" His voice was calm, but there was a flicker of something else in his eyes… something that made her stomach twist. Was it amusement? Hunger? She wasn't sure, but she didn't care. Not right now. Her mind was whirling with her own emotions. She could feel the heat between her legs and how wet she had become from one kiss.

Blair wasn't sure if she should be ashamed. She had been with Dan and only Dan. Now she was getting all hot and heavy with her boss.

She leaned in closer. She still held his tie, her grip on it tightening. ""I… I… need to know,"" she whispered, her voice trembling slightly. ""If… if this is normal.""

His mouth quirked into a half-smile, and he tilted his head, studying her with those piercing gray eyes. ""Normal for what?"" he asked softly, his tone almost teasing. He reached forward to run his fingers down her face. His eyes followed their movement.

Blair bit her mouth, her mind racing. How could she explain this? She couldn't just blurt out that she'd seen her fiancé sleeping someone else… that she didn't even feel jealous about it now or overly heartbroken. She was angry, mad and shocked that she hadn't picked up on the affair. No, she couldn't say it, but she didn't want to come across…. What? Something that wouldn't make her sound like a complete flake or shallow. She needed to see if something was wrong with her. She needed to feel wanted.

""I… I don't know how to describe it,"" she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. ""But I need you to show me.""",1,1751008167.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

This time, Josephine isn't planning to walk away—she's planning to end it.","the 100th time won't end like the others.This time, Josephine isn't planning to walk away—she's planning to end it.Chapter 1In three years of marriage, Josephine Sinclair had caught Peter Garrison cheating for the ninety-ninth time.After an overnight flight, she stood there pale and exhausted, staring at the clothes strewn across the floor.The thick stench of sweat and desire clung to the air, turning her stomach.Peter was shirtless, leaning back against the headboard, the woman in his arms wearing Josephine's silk nightgown.His hand was roaming freely over the woman's body.There was a growing smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth.He arched a brow, flashing a mocking grin at the woman who had just walked in on them.""Well? Doesn't she look better in it than you ever did?""Josephine, if I'm counting right, this makes ninety-nine. And you're still refusing to sign the divorce papers?""She pressed a hand to her stomach, her movements mechanical.For the first time, she didn't explode at his cruelty.""Put some clothes on. We need to talk.""Peter snorted and glanced at her retreating back.""Talk? What is there left for us to talk about?""Josephine stopped but didn't turn around.""About the divorce.""Peter looked stunned for a second, his lips parting slightly.""That's great! Mr. Garrison, you're about to get what you want!""She sat down in the study and waited less than five minutes before Peter pushed the door open, fully dressed.Clearly, he couldn't wait to get this over with.""You're not messing with me, right?""That sneer in his eyes—Josephine saw it loud and clear.She didn't bother responding. Instead, she slid the divorce papers across the desk toward him.""Take a look. If everything looks fine, go ahead and sign.""Peter picked up the document and browsed, slightly furrowed, clearly suspicious. He didn't believe for a second that Josephine would actually want a divorce.The Sinclair family had long since lost its former glory.He was sure she'd cling to him to the bitter end, draining him of every last drop.But once he read through the agreement, he froze.Josephine wasn't asking for anything—not money, not property. She was even giving up their house.He frowned. ""You serious? You're not planning to sign this and then show up at the family estate making a scene, are you?""Josephine remained calm from start to finish.""I'm serious. And no, I won't cause any trouble. Don't worry.""Without another word, Peter grabbed a pen and quickly signed his name at the bottom.As the last stroke landed, the corner of his lips lifted slightly, like a weight had finally been lifted.""Well, if the papers are signed, let's go to the courthouse l and make it official. There's a thirty-day cooling-off period—I don't want to waste a single extra day with you.""""Right now?""Josephine frowned.""Heh, I knew it. You're backing out, aren't you?""Pain twisted in her stomach, but she could not help looking at Peter's mocking expression.""Let's go.""She didn't stop for a second. Together, they filed the paperwork.When the staff handed them a form, he explained, ""If either of you changes your mind within these 30 days—""""Why would I regret this?"" Peter scoffed, tossing the pen onto the desk with a broader grin.Josephine came out late but saw that Peter's car hadn't left yet.He was parked by the roadside, honking the horn at her.The window was halfway down. He took off his sunglasses, looking relaxed as he smirked at her.""Josephine, you know what they say—one night as a couple, a hundred nights of kindness. We did share a bed, after all. No need to worry about finding someone new. That guy earlier seemed pretty into you.""He held out a business card, clearly hoping to humiliate her.What he didn't expect was for Josephine to reach out and take it without hesitation.""Thanks. I'll think about it.""With that, she turned and walked away without a second glance.Leaving Peter frozen in place.Peter didn't know.Those 30 days?They weren't just the countdown to the end of their marriage.They were also the countdown to Josephine's death.Chapter 2Josephine wandered aimlessly through the streets.In her hand was the death sentence the doctor had just handed her.""So you're saying I've got about 30 days left?""""I'm sorry, Ms. Sinclair.""That gut-punch feeling—it wasn't the first time Josephine had experienced it.The Sinclair family was crumbling, and the weight of it all had landed squarely on her shoulders.Back then, she'd felt completely helpless.She'd called Peter.She thought that even if they just bickered or argued, maybe it would make her feel less alone.But he didn't answer. Not once.But Peter hung up on all her calls to him, and when she pushed him too much, he simply turned off his phone to avoid her.The next time she saw him, he was lying naked in their bed with a young model in his arms.Peter never saw how lost and broken she was.All he saw was a face he couldn't stand.He deliberately kissed the young model right before her, the sharp glint at the corner of his lips stabbing at Josephine's eyes.""Well? You ready for that divorce now?""Josephine forced herself to stay calm and fled the room.In Los Angeles, just about everyone knew she and Peter had been at each other's throats since they were kids. Whenever they saw each other, they'd fight.And just about everyone assumed that Josephine hated Peter just as much as he hated her.She touched the ring on her finger—it was one Peter had reluctantly given her after the wedding.When he handed it to her, he'd tossed the ring box at her face.At first, she'd buried her feelings deep, never letting them show.Until Peter forces her to fulfill her duties as a wife.In the middle of one of those moments, he noticed the ring still on her hand.He laughed right then and there.""Josephine, don't tell me the reason you won't sign the divorce papers is because you actually like me.""If that's the case, you'd better get over it. I'm not only never going to like you—I can't stand the sight of you.""Peter's hatred didn't come from nowhere.He hated her because their families had arranged their marriage from the start. And his first love? She'd been forced to move overseas because of it.That night, Josephine stared at the ceiling until morning.Her mother had passed away when she was young. No one had ever told her how to hold on to someone she loved. All the younger versions of her could do was throw barbed words and petty fights to get Peter's attention. But after that?Josephine blinked against the dryness in her eyes.Her phone kept buzzing, breaking her thoughts.She opened the chat and saw Peter flooding the group with digital cash gifts.""What's the occasion, huh? What's got you so excited, Mr. Garrison?""Peter didn't reply. He just dropped a photo in the chat. It was the divorce agreement, signed during the cooling-off period.Just that one picture dropped like a bomb.Suddenly, all the silent lurkers in the group chat exploded.""They really divorced? Josephine actually agreed?!""""Finally! This is the best news ever. Peter, you're finally free!""""We gotta celebrate! Didn't you say seeing Josephine's face daily made you so miserable you couldn't even sleep? Now you're free to date ten or twenty girls at once, and no one can say a thing!""""Am I the only one who finds this weird? Peter slept with all kinds of models and influencers, and Josephine put up with all of it. Why give in now? What if she's just messing with you? What if she doesn't show up at the end and you still can't get a divorce?""The group went silent after that message.Then Josephine's phone started ringing.""Josephine, you're not screwing with me, are you? You're actually gonna follow through after the cooling-off period?""Her pale face twisted into a faint smile.She spoke softly into the phone.""Oh, I'm absolutely screwing with you.""Peter, what are you gonna do about it?""Chapter 3Heavy breathing came through the phone.Josephine figured, that if she were standing in front of Peter right now, she probably wouldn't even make it to the end of the month—he'd strangle her on the spot.Before he could start cursing her out, she let out a soft laugh.""Peter, I'm not messing with you this time, but I do have one condition.""Peter didn't answer.She didn't care. She kept talking anyway.""I want you to do ten things with me. Just ten. Once we're done, I'll sign the divorce papers without a word. I swear—after that, I'll disappear from your life completely.""That offer was tempting. Very tempting.Peter frowned.""Ten's too many. Five.""Josephine gave a quiet chuckle. ""Fine.""The first thing she did was ask him to attend a charity gala with her.She dressed to the nines, and when Peter arrived to pick her up, his fingers flew over his phone screen. He didn't even look up to glance at her.Josephine didn't mind. She knew better than to expect sweet talk from him.But he frowned when he got in the car and finally looked at her.""You lost weight? Your face looks sickly. You look terrible.""Her fingers twitched slightly, but she stared straight ahead and said nothing.When they got out of the car, Peter suddenly grabbed her hand.She froze for a second, and he scoffed.""What's the matter? It's not like we've never held hands or done even more intimate things. Why pretend to be so shy now?""His burning palm wrapped around her cold fingers.It wasn't the first time he'd held her hand—but it was the first time he'd ever done it alone.People around them noticed. The strange harmony between them caught everyone off guard. Eyes widened.The auction began. Josephine spotted something she liked.She raised her paddle instinctively, but someone else beat her to it.It was a painting—a rare final work by a now-deceased foreign artist. Several bidders liked it and started raising their offers.In the end, it was Peter who won with the highest bid.Warmth rushed through her chest.""Wa—""""Send it to the Heath family in Atlanta.""Her outstretched hand froze in midair.So the painting wasn't for her.A wave of bitterness surged inside her, threatening to drown her.She stood up suddenly and walked toward the exit.Peter frowned, got up, and grabbed her arm.""Where do you think you're going? It's not over yet.""She tried to pull free, but his grip was too strong.He was starting to get annoyed. ""You're the one who dragged me here. Now what? Throwing a tantrum? You're seriously messed up.""That last line—messed up—stabbed her straight in the heart.""You're right. I am messed up.""She yanked her arm free and stormed out without looking back.For an entire week, Josephine didn't contact him.She moved out of their home. At first, Peter didn't care.But the thought of the remaining four tasks gnawed at him. Made him restless.For example, if he didn't get them over with soon, Josephine would cling to him all over again.Unable to stand the uncertainty, he called her.When the phone rang, Josephine had just finished a round of radiation therapy.Her condition was deteriorating quickly. Her bones ached constantly.""There are still four things left, Josephine. Don't think you can weasel out of them.""She was silent for a moment.""I want to go to Tibet.""Peter frowned. ""Now?""""Mm. Right now.""He thought she was insane.But he went along with it, for the sake of the divorce, for the sake of finally shaking her off.He booked the tickets to Tibet immediately.Josephine wrapped herself up from head to toe. By the time she arrived, Peter had been waiting impatiently.""What the hell? I offered to pick you up, but you refused. Then you show up late? What were you doing?""She ignored his complaints and handed him her suitcase.""Stop whining.""Peter snorted but took the luggage from her hands without protest.He didn't even realize how natural it had become.Just before boarding, his phone rang.Josephine stood at the gate, looking at him from across the hall.He gripped the phone tighter, his whole body tense.""Sorry, Josephine.""I can't go to Tibet with you.""Chapter 4As soon as he finished speaking, Peter turned and bolted out of the airport.Josephine numbly took out her phone.Sure enough, the top post on her social feed was from Camila Heath.She didn't say a word—just posted a photo of the painting.And Peter, without the slightest hesitation, had broken his promise and walked away.""Miss, boarding ends soon.""Snapped out of her daze by the staff's reminder, Josephine didn't look back. She turned and walked in the opposite direction.After landing in Tibet, she received a text from Peter.""I'll be two days late. Go ahead and have fun first.""She was a little surprised. Late? Not canceling?So, he was actually still planning to come, just in a hurry to finish their 'tasks' and finally get rid of her.Josephine didn't wait. She hired a local guide and joined a tour group.But her body couldn't keep up. Most of the time, she was alone in her room, resting.By the time Peter arrived, she had packed and was preparing to leave.""You dragged me all the way out here, had me drop everything just to mess with me?"" he snapped, kicking her suitcase over in frustration.Clothes spilled out across the floor. Josephine stared at the mess, then let out a bitter laugh.""Mess with you? Isn't Camila staying in the room next door?""Peter stiffened. He faltered.""She's just here to paint. Stop making everything about her.""Josephine's fingers curled slightly. She didn't reply. She simply bent down to gather her clothes.""Am I interrupting something?""Camila appeared in the doorway.The anger on Peter's face vanished instantly.It was replaced with concern. With urgency.""You said you weren't feeling well. Why'd you get up?""""I can't just lie around all day. And I heard your voices—it sounded a little loud, so I thought I'd come to see.""At her words, Peter finally glanced at Josephine again.""It's nothing. Are you hungry? I'll get you something to eat.""Camila gave an embarrassed nod.Just as Peter was about to leave the room, he suddenly paused and turned back.He looked annoyed.""What about you? You want anything?""Josephine was sweating from the effort of packing. Even that small task had left her drained.She heard the shift in his tone, the change in warmth between speaking to her and to Camila.Her voice was flat. ""No.""Peter scowled at her refusal.""Then starve for all I care. You look like a damn ghost.""The door slammed shut behind him, leaving only Josephine and Camila in the room.This wasn't the first time Josephine had met her.The Heath family had risen quickly in Atlanta as nouveau riche, and naturally, the Garrison family looked down on them.Camila had always been proud and resented how the Garrison family judged her.So she left in a huff, trying to make something of herself abroad.But now she'd slinked back home, and the first thing she did was reconnect with her old flame.To Josephine, watching it all from the outside, it was laughable.With Peter gone, Camila didn't even bother keeping up the act.""Ms. Sinclair. Long time no see.""She kicked over the suitcase Josephine had just spent all that time packing.Watching her neatly folded clothes scatter across the floor, something in Josephine snapped.She knew Camila was doing it on purpose.And she fell for it anyway.Without hesitation, her hand flew out and slapped Camila hard across the face.Peter walked in right then. He saw Camila's red cheeks and her teary eyes.The bowl of spaghetti in his hand—meant for Josephine—crashed to the floor.He didn't ask what happened. He stormed across the room and slapped Josephine hard across the face.""Josephine, that's enough!""Camila sobbed and turned to him.""It's my fault. I accidentally knocked over Ms. Sinclair's suitcase. I know I'm not welcome here. I'll leave.""She rushed out.Peter immediately turned to follow.But Josephine's voice stopped him cold.""Peter!""The third thing—I want you to stay.""Chapter 5Peter clenched his fists, glaring at Josephine with fury in his eyes.She already knew what he was about to say.Panting heavily, Josephine's strength seemed to drain all at once.She sank to the floor, rubbing the ear that was still ringing from his slap.Sitting among the pile of clothes, she began folding them again.""Aren't you just waiting to divorce me, so you can marry Camila?""We're almost there. After this, just two things left. What, are you planning to throw it all away now? Honestly, the first two tasks you completed were pathetic. Don't tell me you're getting cold feet about divorcing me?""She looked up at him as she spoke, her gaze locking onto his.His ink-dark eyes were laced with scorn.""Josephine, people should know their place. Too bad you don't.""I'll do this third thing, but you better remember the Sinclair family can't protect you anymore. Touch Camila again, and I'll make sure nothing remains of you to bury.""Josephine lowered her head and gave a bitter smile.Talk tough? She could, too.Back when they used to argue, Peter was never her match.And now, she would soon give him what he wanted without lifting a finger.Peter called Camila, coaxing her gently until she forgave him.Then, under his arrangement, she returned to the country ahead of schedule.Watching how delicately he protected her, Josephine felt like she had swallowed poison.So he did know how to love someone.Just not her.When Peter came back, Josephine still hadn't finished packing.He lost his patience, yanked her to her feet, and bent down to do it himself.""Useless. It's just a few damn things. You've been at it forever and still not done. Anyone would think you were dying, can't even handle this.""Josephine suddenly felt amused by his rant and decided to toy with him.""You're right. I am dying. So what? If I die, will you regret treating me like this?""Peter froze for a second. When he looked up again, his face was full of mockery.""Regret? Don't flatter yourself. If you died, I'd throw a three-day party, firecrackers and all, invite all of Los Angeles to celebrate.""Josephine laughed until her eyes teared up, clutching her abdomen from the pain.""Peter, you've got such a sharp tongue. After everything, we did sleep together, didn't we?""She didn't stick around.She could tell her body had reached its limit.After returning to Los Angeles, she was bedridden for another week.Each radiation session made her hair fall out noticeably faster.The day Peter called to rush her about the last two tasks, she locked herself in the bathroom and cried all afternoon.Once the tears dried, she pulled herself together and went to the mall to buy a wig.""You cut your hair?""She didn't answer his question. Instead, she walked straight to his car.""Let's go.""Peter frowned and instinctively reached out to touch her wig, but she quickly dodged him.""We're on a schedule. Are we going or not?""He climbed into the car. ""Just so you know, the cooling-off period ends in less than seven days. You'd better hurry and figure out the last two things.""Josephine didn't respond. Her eyes remained fixed on the window outside.She used to be too busy arguing with Peter, too busy trying to talk to him, and she ignored the beauty of Los Angeles all around her.She thought they could share the same view if she could stand on the same level as him.But the truth is that to someone who doesn't love you, it doesn't matter if you're standing right beside them; they'll still look right past you.And for the one he loves, he'll lower his proud head without hesitation.The fourth thing Josephine asked for was simple, she wanted Peter to go with her to an amusement park.""How childish,"" he scoffed, giving her a disdainful look.Chapter 6Josephine lowered her lashes. She had seen Peter take Camila to the amusement park before, watching him patiently pose for pictures with her repeatedly, never once showing annoyance.This wasn't about comparing herself to Camila.She just had a childhood wish to one day go to an amusement park with Peter.This fourth request was her way of fulfilling a dream for the little girl she used to be.Although Peter followed her around physically, his mind was clearly somewhere else.His eyes never left his phone. Josephine had to call him four or five times before he finally looked up to take a photo of her.As night fell and the lights began to flicker on, Peter urged her to leave thrice, but she ignored him each time.Until the lights of the Ferris wheel glowed in the distance.She pointed at it with hopeful eyes.""Just one last ride, then we can go.""Peter paused, stunned by the light in her expression.After a long silence, he pressed his lips together and said coldly, ""Josephine, even if we reach the top of that Ferris wheel, I still won't fall in love with you.""Seconds ticked by in silence.Josephine blinked fast, trying to hide the sting in her eyes. Then she turned her head away.""Geez, who said anything about that? I've just never been on one before, that's all.""Suddenly, his phone rang, shattering the moment.Camila was on the other end, and her voice laced with panic.Peter didn't even look back as he walked off this time, not even bothering to offer an apology.When the Ferris wheel finally rose to its highest point, Josephine looked out over the city's sparkling lights below.Tears silently rolled down her cheeks.She whispered to herself, ""Happy birthday, Josephine.""After that night, Josephine was rushed to the hospital with a high fever.The steady beeping of machines filled the room, but to her ears, it was as if everything had gone quiet.In her blurred state, she thought she saw Peter standing at her bedside.But even as he looked at her pale and fragile form, there was not a trace of compassion in his eyes.He curled his lips into a mocking smile.""Serves you right. Bad people always get what they deserve in the end.""Go ahead and die already, would you? Then I won't have to do your stupid final request.""In the dream, Josephine was shaking with rage, her teeth grinding in frustration. But her heart felt like it had been soaked in sour, bitter, aching lemon juice.With all the strength she had left, she forced her eyes open.But the person she had hoped to see wasn't there.""Thank God, you're finally awake. Do you even know how long you were out?""Josephine had always been strong-willed, while everyone else chased vanity.Now that the Sinclair family had fallen from grace, Peter had never gotten along with her.Everyone knew he'd be the first to show up to watch her crash and burn.The others had picked their sides early and made it clear that they wanted nothing to do with her.The only person still by her side was the nurse who'd been quietly looking after her all this time.Hearing her words, Josephine quickly looked up in a panic.""What day is it?""Tania Clark thought she was worried about how little time she had left.Hiding the emotion in her face, she gently tried to comfort her.""It's the 28th. Josephine...""""Where's my wig?""Josephine cut her off.Tania froze for a second.""Here, I kept it for you.""Josephine reached out with trembling fingers and took it from her.Her eyes were lowered, her expression unreadable.""Tania, while I was unconscious, did anyone come to see me?""Her voice was quiet, cautious. She clutched the wig tightly in her hands.Tania's heart ached at the sight of her like this.But she didn't want to lie.""Josephine, Peter never came.""After she spoke, Tania quickly turned away and blinked back her tears.Not only had he not come.He hadn't even taken her calls or responded to the hints she dropped.""Coma? Don't be ridiculous. Of all people, Josephine wouldn't fall into a coma.""I'm busy. I don't have time for her games. Unless it's that final thing she wants, I'm not agreeing to anything. Tell her to quit wasting my time.""Chapter 7After Peter rejected her calls three times in a row, Josephine finally lost her patience.She sent him a text.Sure enough, less than two minutes later, he called back.But his voice on the other end was laced with exhaustion.""Camila's sick. I need to be with her.""We'll talk about the last request in a few days.""He was about to hang up when Josephine shouted, ""No!""The moment the word left her mouth, Peter gave a cold laugh.""It's just two days. It's not like I'm breaking the deal. Josephine, enough is enough!""Josephine's nose stung, and she swallowed the lump in her throat.Trying to sound breezy even though her body felt like it was being ripped apart, she forced a laugh.""Peter, there's only one thing left. Once you do it, you'll be free. Or are you having second thoughts? Still want to be stuck in this marriage with me? That's fine, I don't mind.""Peter had always been easy to provoke when it came to that kind of talk.And just like she expected, it worked. After hanging up, Josephine sat there laughing, phone in hand.She laughed so hard that tears streamed down her face, slipping into her mouth. The bitterness tasted like knives slicing through her heart.She was terrified that Peter would notice something was off, and even more afraid he'd laugh at her again right before she died.So before he arrived, Josephine had Tania do her makeup.It was only a five-minute walk downstairs, but it took Josephine nearly 20 minutes to reach him.""So slow. It's the last thing already. Spit it out.""He looked visibly annoyed, but Josephine wasn't fazed in the slightest.She climbed into the passenger seat, buckled her seatbelt, and only then turned to look at him.""It's simple. Make my lunch.""Peter stared at her as if she were crazy. ""Just lunch?""Josephine nodded.""Just one lunch.""Peter gave her a long, suspicious look.The first four requests had been her constantly nitpicking and making things difficult.For the last one, he had assumed she would ask for something impossible, like plucking the moon from the sky.But instead, all she wanted was lunch.He glanced at the time, picked up his phone, and sent several messages.A moment later, he started the car and drove to the supermarket.This was the first time Josephine had ever gone grocery shopping with Peter.The first time they ever did anything that remotely resembled what ordinary couples did.Peter pushed the shopping cart while Josephine stood beside him, pointing out what to buy.At the checkout, Josephine stood right by his side.A child suddenly came running by, almost crashing into her.Peter instinctively pulled her behind him, shielding her with his body.And in that moment, his hand gripped hers tightly.Josephine lowered her gaze, looking at their interlocked hands, and her eyes welled up again.This was only the second time Peter had ever held her hand willingly.But before she could even feel the warmth of his palm, he let go.Back at their home, Josephine followed him inside.This place held a few memories for them.Peter had only married her because he was forced to, and had spent every day since finding ways to rebel against the arrangement.His ninety-nine affairs were just the tip of the iceberg.After changing his shoes, Peter walked straight into the kitchen.The breath Josephine had been forcing herself to hold finally escaped, and she sank to the floor.By the time he returned, she was wearing her usual mask again, looking calm and composed as she eyed the food he had made.She hadn't even known Peter could cook.The man who had always been arrogant and untouchable had learned to cook for a woman.He must really love Camila.""So many dishes? You think the two of us can eat all this?""Josephine frowned slightly as he kept bringing out plate after plate.With her current condition, she couldn't possibly eat that much.A few bites too many, and the truth would show.Peter set down the last plate, his expression unreadable.""Who said it's just the two of us?""Chapter 8Josephine stared at him in shock.Before she could even process what he meant, the doorbell rang.A moment later, Peter put on a bright smile and went to open the door.""Peter, am I late? Blame my students, they wouldn't stop asking me questions today!""Camila moved through the entryway like she knew the place by heart, casually picking up a coffee mug from the shelf.Josephine recognized it right away. It was the one she'd bought not long ago but never used before she walked out of this house.Josephine couldn't stand how familiar Camila was with the house.She felt a chill run through her body.""You're right on time. Go wash up, lunch is ready!""Peter's gentle voice stabbed into her ears like needles.Camila giggled coyly and walked over to the dining table.""Ms. Sinclair, sorry I'm late!""Josephine didn't respond, and Camila clearly didn't care whether she did; she just headed straight to her seat.""Peter, you're the best. You even set my utensils out in advance.""""I know how picky you are. I washed them several times just so you can check.""""Well then, what reward do you want?""Peter reached out and pinched her cheek. ""I just want you to eat properly. You've been working so hard and then got so sick, you've lost weight.""Josephine silently watched the two flirt back and forth like no one else was in the room.Her heart, which had already died long ago, somehow began to throb again.She couldn't help it. She had to say something to stop this farce.""Peter, what did you mean by doing the last thing I asked?""Every inch of her body felt like it had sprouted thorns.When Peter finally looked at her, he noticed how thin Josephine had gotten.Guilt flickered across his face, but his words still came out self-righteously.""I made all this, and you wouldn't be able to finish it anyway.""Camila just got out of the hospital. I've been with her the whole time. You're the one who insisted I do this now. I wasn't going to leave her alone.""Camila sat directly across from her, the smugness in her eyes practically screaming, ""You really are an idiot.""Josephine suddenly felt exhausted.All her strength, everything she had forced herself to hold together, came crashing down like a house of cards.Her whole body hurt, not just her heart, but every bone, every nerve.Head drooping, she looked like a withered husk.The next second, she forced herself to stand.But her eyes remained fixed on the floor.""Peter, I should've never expected anything from you.""Her voice was barely audible, like a pin dropping onto a thick carpet, silent, unnoticed.When she turned to leave, Peter instinctively took a step forward.But Camila moved faster.She reached out to stop Josephine, but her sleeve caught on the edge of Josephine's wig.In one harsh tug, the wig was yanked off.Peter gasped sharply.""Josephine! Where's your hair?!""",1,1751007996.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1llnhah,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1llnhah/my_22m_situationship_has_a_very_close_girl_friend/,my 22M situationship has a very close girl friend and it bothers me 24F,"Hi, first I want to discuss that this is judgement free zone and I would like advice from experienced men and women. I am a 24F and I have been talking to a 22M  for almost 7 months. I am an outgoing woman and I have my own Real Estate business and that requires me to network a lot. I have been in 4 relationships before and I feel like I love hard and invest a lot into my relationship. I understand the concept of respect and putting my partner after God. (I’m a Christian). Just like everyone, I have my own flaws. When he makes me mad I tend to lash out. This is something I’ve been working on with therapy, this gives me no excuse to lash out, but given my Asian background, our parents did that to us growing up as well as being absent. Through the years of therapy while not being in a relationship, I learned a lot about myself. Like my childhood trauma that comes out in relationships, (fear of abandonment, not worthy of love, etc). I have learned that triggers my trauma and I’ve learned to communicate that with my partner to not overstep boundaries that causes me to lash out. I told myself if a man couldn’t respect my boundaries, then I need to leave because I hate that version of myself. Again, something I still need to work on. 

Moving on to 22M (Asian). He is very shy when it comes to meeting new people. He has NEVER been in a relationship. I was the very first girl for everything, hugs, kisses, dates, etc. He grew up in a similar household as me, absent parents, yelling, etc. He has genuine soul and heart, he doesn’t get mad or yell and always putting others before him. Him and I were great friends before we started talking. Everyone could tell we had chemistry. People would mention if we were dating whenever we were just friends. It’s 7 months in and we aren’t tired of each other. We love each other’s presences. We’re always on the phone and we could stay up talking for hours. I just feel like he does not know how to be in a relationship. Whenever I pull away (stop talking to him), he’ll start trying again. He’ll bring me coffee and pick me up to go to church on Sundays. He’ll try to make plans to hang out. But whenever we are talking, he doesn’t bring me coffee or pick me up to go to church or makes effort to hang out. It’s always on his time. 

One of my biggest issues that we argue about all the time is that he is very close to his “brother’s” (not blood related: he has been a family friend for a long time) girlfriend. He tells me that they have nothing going on. He’s known her for 3-4 years. At first I was okay with them hanging out, but he would always put her before me. We would plan to hangout or he doesn’t commit to plans just in case she asks to hang out, like go to the gym or go eat. Then it became an issue. I also found out that he would send her long paragraphs on how much he loves her as a sister/mom. He would send them weekly and stopped whenever I found out. I understand their relationship is platonic, but I feel like that is her boyfriend’s job to go to the gym with her and send her paragraphs. Out of respect, I feel like she should respect the he is talking to someone and respect our relationship. For example, my guy friends, whenever they get into a relationship, I totally understand if the girl is not comfortable with me, I’m always encouraged to meet her and I understand the my guy friend and I won’t hang out as much anymore. I always tell them to go get their girls as in build a life with them. I feel like she doesn’t understand the concept and she feeds off all the attention. 22M knows that I am uncomfortable whenever he hangs out with her. He never invites me to hang out with them, he doesn’t answer he calls whenever he’s with me, and they are number one best friends on snapchat. Again, I feel like that is her boyfriend’s job because I believe in putting your partner first for everything. Like I said, I didn’t have an issue with this before until I found out he was sending her long paragraphs (I only get one whenever he’s done something wrong or whenever I stop talking to him), would ditch me to hang out with her, etc. 

I know I am naming a lot of red flags, but I have been patient with him since he’s never been in a relationship. I feel like I’m too nice. At this point, I am getting emotionally checked out. This relationship feels toxic. I lash out whenever he hangs out with her and as I mentioned before, I hate that version of myself. I am very close to his family and they’re always inviting me over for dinner. I’m not from here so I don’t have many friends and any family here, but I felt like I found family within his family. Which I understand I would have to cut ties with all of them. I know I deserve better and I feel like I am settling for less. Him and I grew up in the similar environments and wanted to break the generational trauma and grow together. I feel like I should be a priority whenever it comes to a relationship because I would do the same thing for my partner. I simply can’t accept that he is that close with her. Is it because I don’t have someone that close? Or is it because he’s young and doesn’t understand life? We argue about the same thing and I feel like he is not considering me or my feelings. I tried blocking him and he’d show up at my door whenever he misses me and tries to get me back and we would be in the same cycle.

Ladies, I feel like you would understand my emotions and feelings more and I would like your advice.
Gentlemen’s I would like your advice on how your very first relationship went and your thoughts and opinions.
Please no mean comments. Thank you.",1,1751007909.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1llnh6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/1llnh6a/college_veterans_do_you_feel_supported_by_your/,"College Veterans: Do you feel supported by your On-Campus Vet Center/ Certifying Office? If so, How? If not, what do you feel they could do better?","First and foremost, This is very wordy. Please forgive me in advance. I have much to say, and I'm not confident on how to TL;DR it. sorry.

In the interest of transparency, I am not a veteran. I am a dependent in college, and I work in my university's vet center assisting with GI Bill certification, explaining benefit eligibility and general information to students, and similar tasks.

At my university, we have a pretty large service-member student population, totaling to around 1-2k (in addition to twice that in dependents), mostly attributed to our geographic location and proximity to a number of military bases. Our vet center is pretty much vet-run, with our department founder and our head of department both being veterans, as well as most of our day-to-day leadership being veterans. With that being said, they have created friendly relationships with vet-students on campus, as well as maintained a close relationship with our Student Veterans of America chapter. They have implemented a lot of (imo) great programs and initiatives specifically for veteran/service member students (resume building workshops, entrepreneurship workshops with local (often veteran) business owners, coffee socials, a special Veteran stole and accompanying cord, a cording ceremony for graduating veterans (and active-duty service members), and a resource booklet that contains campus resources (both related and unrelated to veteran-specific needs) as well as off-campus partners such as local county-run offices that assist with disability claims, couseling services, and resources to assist with financial & food insecurities, to name a few. All that being said, I'd like to think that our program makes our vets feel supported and that if either of my parents were to enroll alongside me, they feel supported by our program as well.

Leading into my main topic, I recently attended a conference for directors of Vet Centers, and students (I attended at this capacity, along with a colleague) working at Vet Centers (or leading helpful military advocacy initiatives on campus), both across a number of institutions across the nation. I, myself, was sent in connection to a project I am working on in the office (with the goal being to shed light on the difficulties and triumphs experienced by our vet-students, faculty, and staff, through an anthology of interviews, honing in on the fact that just because they are vets does not mean they have the same lived experiences, struggles, goals, successes, etc.). I had the opportunity to speak to a number of students about their programs and initiatives, and it was clear that many of them were struggling to get off the ground due to a number reasons. The most common was, of course, lack of resources, whether that be financial, lack of institutional support, or lack of man power. The second most common reason was a lack of engagement amongst student veterans with the programs and initiatives. As described to me by one of my supervisors (and one of the pioneers of our program), some veteran students have a tendency to self-isolate, mostly due to the fact that they are (generally) older and more lived than their peers. I believe it is for this reason that many of the students I spoke to were experiencing such a lack of engagement in amazing programs, such as military student orientation (guidance with using VA education benefits, intro to mil. clubs on campus, vet engagement event calendars, etc.) but hardly any vets sign up. All that to say, the conference was really enlightening to a lot of the nuanced difficulties within high-ed military advocacy. I also recognize that, while i think our program is fantastic, our actual student veterans may not feel the same (If you read this and recognize the resources I listed (in the ""wait don't we have all of that"" sorta way) and you feel differently than I do about the program, please please please share. I would ask that you don't name drop though. Or if your institution has similar programs, and they have room to grow, please share that as well.)

In conclusion, I would love to hear from student veterans (and student service members in general), and about your institutions. What they do right, what they do wrong, the inbetween stuff. Not just resources, but even the way they address their vet population (language, attitudes, misconceptions, etc.). My end goal with this post is to learn from the lived and shared experiences of a multitude of real people. I can only learn so much from my singular community of veterens, especially in a contained environment. Also, please check me on any generalized statements, not-cool terminology & phrasing, or anything of the sort. I strive to be the best advocate I can be.

The wind howled through the towering trees surrounding Stone Manor, carrying with it the kind of cold that seeps into the bones. Rain lashed against the windowpanes like nature itself was trying to shake the secrets from the house. Inside, the manor was far too quiet.

In the study, lit dimly by the dying fire, Alaric Stone sat slumped over his desk. His hand, once firm and commanding, now limp and lifeless beside a spilled mug of coffee. The silver letter opener, protruding from his back, glinted ominously under the flickering light. A draft stirred the curtains. Somewhere, a clock ticked.

Detective Sierra-X stood in the doorway. To most, he was a mystery—a shadow among whispers. But where others saw chaos, he saw patterns. Where others saw mourning, he saw motive.

The scene didn’t scream. It whispered. A locked door from the inside, no signs of forced entry, and a corpse that had likely welcomed his killer. The list of suspects was short, yet layered with history.

Eleanor Stone, the grieving widow who wasn’t crying. She claimed to be bathing at the time of the murder, but the tub had been bone-dry.

James Reed, the butler, loyal to a fault. He’d said he was polishing silver. Not one piece had been touched.

Valerie Cross, the charming niece. Her alibi? Reading in her room. And yet, her novel was lying near the victim.

Theo Lang, the business partner. He kept sipping scotch, eyes unreadable. He knew the company was slipping through his fingers.

Sierra-X didn’t accuse. He peeled. Layers of half-truths and convenient forgetfulness began to unravel. The new will Alaric had written? Eleanor had read it before anyone else. Reed’s spotless silverware? Too clean to have ever been touched. Valerie’s book? Found right in the blood-stained study.

Then there were the subtleties—two mugs instead of one. The security camera, cut. A second set of footprints on the dusty floor.

One lie alone can be a mistake. Four lies coordinated is a pattern.

Each had a reason. Each had a part. Valerie had lured him in. Eleanor had found her rage. James had wiped away the traces. Theo ensured the cameras never told the truth.

By the time Sierra-X left the manor, the storm had stopped. But the air was heavier. The silence had changed.

It was never a question of who. It was always a matter of how deep the truth was buried.",1,1751007792.0,flashfiction,0,1.0,False

I was baptized just under a month ago I have received the priesthood. The members of my ward are wonderful people. Friendly kind genuine people. When I was sick recently they even called to check on me and see if I needed anything.

Now my question is this why won't they give me solid evidence and answers to my following questions 

- Heavenly mother, what a load of absolute BS that doctrine is, it's legit pagan philosophy. God and heavenly mother bonk each other and make heaps of spirit babies geez God get a better job right ? She must be exhausted 🫩 Is this the same God that made the heavens and the earth and the waters? Who is this ? Wtf is this sh*t? They can't answer me BUT WORSE they say ""oh it's just makes sense"" WHAT ! NO IT DOESN'T 

- God the father was once a mortal man that had to progress to become God. You must be joking ? They don't honestly believe that bullsh*t do they ? Who birthed him and where ? Again they won't and can't answer me. Read the smith papers it's legit Polytheism and pagan philosophy. 

- There is a pantheon of Gods and Goddesses in heaven right now serving as advisors to Elohim.... oh yeah ...and guess what elohim is confusing AF in Mormonism, one time Elohim was a stone idol called YAWEH or some sh*t like that  then he became a man and then a god with a glorified body I mean this guy Elohim can't make up his own mind what he wants to be. He's now God the father. 

- I was told there is nothing in the bible that says you can't worship other Gods and Goddesses. Do these idiots read the ten commandments? Like really, it's so simple it's in the 10 commandants. But they will pick holes in a sieve to justify that heavenly father is just one of many deities. That's not Christianity at all not even close. That is pure paganism and Polytheism. 

Why wasn't I taught all this in my lessons with my missionaries? These concepts seem to be the core of the LDS church, why didn't they teach me all this. I feel so betrayed and I don't know what to do. The good people in my ward I believe have also been lead on it's not their fault, they don't know. 
It seems in Mormonism God is just a man. If I wanted to worship another man I could just go worship my neighbour he's exactly the same as heavenly father. So lame and mundane. 

I have been as genuine as i can be I gave up coffee, vaping and I'm that chaste right now that cobwebs are growing and dust is gathering on me. I don't want to leave but it's like they are giving me no option but to. These doctrines and beliefs claim astronomical things as truth,  but they can't explain it.

She’s known him longer than the world has—before the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday—a regular Tuesday for him. She doesn’t expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests, *“Maybe when you’re done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.”* But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry—not at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly—a new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry—just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

Behind the Scenes: Forbidden Tension on a Movie Set. My name is Vanessa. I'm 28 years old, female, and I live and work deep within the belly of the beast the film industry, specifically here in Los Angeles. It's a world of controlled chaos, relentless deadlines, and people who live and breathe storytelling. It’s also a world where lines blur, pressure mounts, and sometimes, things that shouldn't happen feel almost inevitable.

This is about Mark.

He’s the director on the project I've been swallowed whole by for the last eight months. He’s older, maybe early fifties, acclaimed, intense, and possesses this… aura. He walks onto set and the energy shifts. He's not conventionally handsome in a movie-star way more rugged, with sharp eyes that seem to see everything and a voice that can cut through the noise of a hundred-person crew yet also soften to a low rumble when he's talking to you, and just you.

My role puts me in close proximity to him constantly. I'm not an actress; I'm part of the creative team, working behind the scenes. So our interactions are professional long discussions about script nuances, character motivations, shot lists, pacing. But from the beginning, there was something else humming beneath the surface.

It started subtly. A look held a fraction too long across a crowded room. His hand on my arm as he made a point, the touch lingering for just a second longer than necessary. The way he’d angle his body towards mine during meetings, cutting out the rest of the world. I told myself it was my imagination, heightened by the sleep deprivation and the sheer intensity of the work. This industry grinds you down and wires you up at the same time; maybe I was just projecting.

But the feeling grew. It was a slow burn, a creeping heat that started low in my stomach and spread outwards. I’d find myself watching him when I didn't need to. The way the light caught his profile as he studied a monitor, the focused furrow in his brow, the unconscious habit he had of running a hand through his hair when he was deep in thought. My body would react a sudden flush, a tightness in my chest, a prickling sensation on my skin. It was involuntary, undeniable.

One night, we were working late in the editing suite. Just the two of us. The air conditioning had broken hours ago, and the room felt close, thick with the hum of the machines and the smell of stale coffee. We were reviewing a particularly challenging scene, dissecting every frame. I was sitting beside him, our shoulders almost touching. He kept pausing the footage, leaning closer to point something out on the screen. Each time he moved, I could feel the warmth radiating off him. His scent something woody and a little spicy filled my senses, making it hard to focus on the dialogue on the screen.

He turned to me, his face close, illuminated by the flickering light of the monitor. ""What do you think?"" he asked, his voice softer than usual in the quiet room.

I opened my mouth to speak, but for a second, no sound came out. My throat felt tight. His eyes, usually so sharp and critical, were fixed on mine, and for a moment, it felt like he wasn’t looking at the editor or the colleague, but at me. Really seeing me. And in that look, layered beneath the professional intensity, I saw… something else. Recognition? Or perhaps something deeper, mirroring the unexpected heat that was coiling tighter inside me with every passing second.

I managed to stammer out an answer about the scene, my voice a little shaky. He nodded, but his gaze didn't waver immediately. He just... looked at me. And in that prolonged silence, in the close heat of the room, the air between us felt thick, charged. It was purely a look, purely a moment of shared silence in a cramped space, illuminated by a screen. But my body was screaming. My skin felt alive, painfully sensitive. My heart was pounding so hard I was sure he could hear it. I wanted to reach out, to bridge the tiny gap between us, to just… touch.

I had to force myself to look away, back at the screen, feigning intense concentration as a wave of heat washed over me, making my cheeks burn. He finally turned back to the monitor too, but the atmosphere had shifted. The professional barrier, usually so solid, felt suddenly fragile, translucent.

After that night, the tension was a constant companion. It was in the way he’d stand slightly too close when we talked, in the way his hand would accidentally brush mine when reaching for a script, in the shared, knowing glances that seemed to pass between us when others weren’t looking. It was a silent language, a secret current running beneath the surface of our professional interactions, and it was intoxicating.

It felt wrong, exciting, forbidden. He was my director. There were unspoken rules about power dynamics, about maintaining professional distance. But the pull was magnetic, growing stronger each day. My thoughts were consumed by him. I'd replay moments in my head, analyzing every word, every glance, every accidental touch. I’d lie awake at night, my body aching with a nameless longing, picturing his face, the intensity in his eyes, the roughness of his hand.

There was another time, during a location scout. We were deep in the desert, miles from anywhere, exploring a potential site at sunset. The light was incredible golden, casting long shadows, paint the landscape in fiery hues. It was just him, me, and the vast, silent expanse. We walked ahead of the rest of the small crew, discussing the logistics. The conversation was entirely work-related, logistical, practical. But as we stood there, side-by-side, watching the sun dip below the horizon, the quiet felt profound.

He turned to me, the setting sun behind him, his face shadowed but his eyes catching the last of the light. He didn't say anything at first, just looked at my face. My breath hitched. The air felt thin, electric. All the earlier tension, the hidden desires, the silent language it all converged in that moment. The vastness of the landscape seemed to shrink, the world narrowing down to just the two of us.

Every instinct in my body was urging me forward. To close the distance. To touch his face. To feel the warmth of his skin. My hands tingled, my lips felt sensitive, my entire body felt heavy with unspoken longing. It was a raw, visceral urge, stripping away the layers of professionalism, of convention. It was just pure, unadulterated wanting.

He finally spoke, his voice low, barely above a whisper, though there was no one else close enough to hear. ""It's beautiful, isn't it?""

He wasn't talking about the sunset. I knew it. The way he said it, the intensity in his eyes, the slight catch in his voice it wasn’t about the landscape. It was about the moment. Us. The potent connection that had been simmering between us for months, finally boiling over in the quiet, empty desert.

I couldn't speak. I just nodded, my gaze locked with his. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat in the overwhelming silence. I could feel the blood rushing through my veins, a warm tide spreading through my body. Every nerve ending felt exposed, quivering. My skin felt flushed, sensitive to the cool evening air that was just beginning to creep in.

He took a small step closer. My breath hitched again. I could feel the heat radiating off him, even in the cooling air. His eyes dropped to my lips for a fraction of a second before flickering back up to mine. The unspoken question hung heavy in the air, thick with longing, with temptation.

This was it. The moment. The culmination of months of suppressed glances, accidental touches, and simmering heat. My mind was a whirlwind of conflicting thoughts the potential consequences, the absolute wrongness of it, the career implications. But louder than any of that was the primal roar of desire, the desperate need to bridge that final distance, to feel his mouth on mine, to finally release the unbearable tension that had been binding me.

My body made the decision before my mind could process it. I leaned in, just slightly. A silent invitation, a surrender to the overpowering pull. His eyes darkened, and he started to lean in too slowly, deliberately, as if acknowledging the weight and significance of the moment. The air crackled between us. I could feel the warmth of his breath on my face. My eyes fluttered shut, anticipation making me tremble. My entire being was focused on that single point of connection, the feeling of finally crossing the threshold.

It felt like an eternity, that slow approach, every nerve ending screaming in delicious agony. The silence was broken only by the sound of our breathing, accelerating, mingling. I could almost taste it, the release, the surrender to the overwhelming temptation that had consumed me. My body felt molten, ready to yield, craving the touch, the kiss that felt both inevitable and impossibly daring.

And just as our lips were about to meet, a voice called out from a little distance away, shatter the fragile bubble we had created. ""Mark? Vanessa? You coming?""

The spell was broken.

We sprang apart as if burned, stumbling back from each other, the air thick with embarrassment and frustrated longing. He cleared his throat, his face impassive once more, the mask of the professional firmly back in place. I felt a cold wave of mortification wash over me, quickly followed by a deeper, more unsettling disappointment.

We turned and walked back towards the crew, the vast, silent desert now simply the location we needed to assess. The conversation that followed was strictly about camera angles and lighting. But the memory of that moment, the raw intensity of the pull, the physical ache of unfulfilled desire, lingered.

It wasn’t a kiss. Not technically. Our lips didn't touch. But in that moment, in that shared leaning-in, in the mutual acknowledgement of the fierce, potent desire that had been building between us, it felt like everything. It felt like a surrender, a confession whispered between two souls drawn together by an irresistible current, in a world where such currents were dangerous.

And that’s the confession. Not necessarily an action, not something explicit by the world's standards, but the internal yielding. The acknowledgement that the temptation wasn't just acknowledged, but desired. The feeling of my entire body responding, craving, leaning in. The potent, undeniable heat that consumed me, making me forget everything else for a terrifying, exhilarating moment.

It’s still there, that tension, thrumming beneath the surface whenever we’re together. Every glance, every touch, every quiet moment alone carries the weight of that sunset in the desert. And sometimes, late at night, the memory of feeling his breath on my face, the anticipation of that almost-kiss, is enough to make that wave of heat flood through me all over again, leaving me breathless and achingly aware of the potent, dangerous longing that still lives within me.

This industry is a strange thing. It creates stories on screen, but sometimes, the most intense dramas unfold just out of sight, in the quiet spaces between the action, fueled by long hours, close proximity, and desires you never knew you had, waiting to be confessed.",1,1751007249.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1llnatk,https://www.reddit.com/r/WLW_PH/comments/1llnatk/calling_out_an_ex_help_me_out_here/,Calling out an ex! Help me out here!,"Help me understand why would you call out an ex? 

For context, my gf and I broke up 11 months ago, we were together for 7 years. She didn’t see a future with me since she wasn’t out and she wants to have kids. She was the alpha in the relationship, I have nothing against that.

We still talk, have dinner and do some errands together.

The other night she was working late in her condo and she ran out of coffee pods for her keurig machine and I know she likes the pods of Tully’s. So I offered to bring some of my Donut Shop pods to her condo. She said that there’s no need. Her next text was “you really don’t know me” and went on. 

What I don’t understand is she still keeps on calling me out. I never called her out for anything. I want to, but I wont. She keeps on saying “and this is why we’re not together anymore” or “you really never knew me”.

During those 7 years I never took her for granted and I can say that confidently. Literally dedicated my life to her; from not going to work and choosing to go with her and miss out on family gatherings. Love wasn’t enough, likely that was my fault. I never asked for anything in return 

I’m not playing the victim here (ew) I acknowledge that yes I wasn’t enough for her. I didn’t communicate my feelings when we were still together. But to still keep calling me out, even though I told her that its not fair to me, is too much.

Make me understand, why would you repetitively call out an ex?

1lln8wu,https://i.redd.it/dgr2cl3w2f9f1.jpeg,The Other Woman,"Sheila's world, once a comfortable tapestry of routine and family, began to unravel with the quiet creak of floorboards in the dead of night. It started subtly: a moved book, a rearranged spice rack. Then, it escalated to the underwear drawer – always the underwear drawer. Sheila, a woman in her mid-forties, would wake to find her neatly folded delicates inexplicably shifted from one drawer to another.
""John, did you move my underwear again?"" she'd ask, a playful exasperation in her voice that soon turned to genuine frustration. John, her husband of twenty years, would always deny it, his brow furrowed in confusion. But deep down, a familiar dread coiled in his gut. He knew she hadn't moved them. And he knew it wasn't him. He'd seen this before, years ago, in fleeting, unsettling moments he’d tried to rationalize away.
The incidents grew stranger. Furniture would be shifted, sometimes just a few inches, sometimes entire pieces across the room. As these nocturnal disturbances increased, Sheila’s sleep became fragmented, each missed hour tightening the vise of paranoia around her mind. She started to eye John with a suspicion that clawed at her.
John's Early Observations
Flashback: Years Earlier
John remembered the first time he'd truly noticed. Sheila, asleep beside him, her breathing even. He'd woken to a soft thud, a scrape from downstairs. He'd crept down, half-expecting an intruder, only to find the living room rug askew, a framed photo turned face-down on the mantle. Sheila was still asleep when he returned to bed. He'd dismissed it then, a restless dream, perhaps, or a half-remembered chore.
As her suspicions festered, the thought of seeking help flickered in Sheila's mind, only to be immediately extinguished. Doctors? They were all quacks, she'd always believed, only interested in pills and quick diagnoses. But then came the nights when she was too afraid to sleep, too terrified of what she might find moved, too utterly alone with her racing thoughts. One such night, shivering under her covers, Sheila made a vow: she would do whatever it took to find answers, to regain some control over her slipping reality. Living in a mostly rural farming county, Sheila knew her options for ""finding answers"" were severely limited. A conventional approach felt impossible, maybe even pointless.
Sheila's Desperate Gambit
Flashback: The Plan Takes Shape
Alone in her kitchen, the glow of the digital clock a stark reminder of another sleepless night, Sheila stared at the bottle of dish soap. ""Polonium poison,"" she muttered, a dark humor touching her lips. It was insane, but what wasn't, anymore? If she walked in demanding a toxicology report, they'd laugh her out. But a life-threatening emergency? That would get their attention. They'd have to listen. She'd mix some household items, something harmless but convincing, and present it as her desperate, terrifying proof. It was a gamble, a performance, but it was a path to someone, anyone, who might see beyond the madness and find the truth.
Before her suspicions turned to infidelity, Sheila enacted her plan. She walked into the local emergency room one evening, clutching what she claimed was a vile of ""polonium poison."" It was a crude, homemade mixture from household items, a prop for a performance she hoped would get her noticed, but the terror in her eyes was all too real. After testing, it was found to be nothing more than the contents of a child’s toy glow stick. It was during this bewildering emergency room visit that Sheila first met Dr. Will Thompson, who was on duty that night. Though their initial encounter was brief and tinged with confusion, Will’s calm demeanor and steady gaze left a subtle, reassuring impression on Sheila.
A Husband's Desperate Act
Flashback: Recent Past
The ""polonium poison"" incident had been a jarring escalation. John had watched her that morning, adding a tiny, almost imperceptible drop from a clear vial into her coffee. He’d ordered the sedative online, a mild one, desperate for her to just sleep. He’d seen the exhaustion in her eyes, the growing agitation. He thought if she could just rest, truly rest, whatever was happening to her mind would subside. He never intended harm, only desperate, misguided help. He remembered how her eyes had snapped open one night he stood over her, the glow of the digital clock illuminating his panicked face, before she drifted off again. He told himself it was for her own good.
Her paranoia then shifted, evolving into the belief that John was having an affair, leading her to accuse him of leaving the house nightly. She confided in neighbors, whispering about his ""odd behavior,"" their sympathetic glances slowly morphing into something more hesitant, concerned.
As her grip on reality loosened further, Sheila developed a new, elaborate theory for the nocturnal disturbances. She became convinced that someone was removing her window A/C unit, coming into the house to move things around, leaving, and then meticulously replacing the unit before morning. She'd scrutinize the window sills, searching for proof, trying to convince bewildered friends and family of this elaborate nightly intrusion. A kind neighbor, trying to alleviate Sheila’s distress and dismiss her increasingly outlandish claims, even helped her install an elaborate alarm system on every window and door. Each morning, the alarms would be undisturbed, yet the unsettling shifts persisted. Sheila began to feel a strange, almost deliberate presence in her home, as if an unseen hand had a life of its own.
The Unseen Hand
Flashback: Night of the A/C Incident
John watched her from the hallway that night, a shadow among shadows. She was meticulously replacing the window A/C unit she'd just removed, her brow furrowed in concentration. He'd seen her, an hour earlier, carefully prying it out, slipping inside, then moving objects with quiet, deliberate movements. He'd crept back to bed, his heart aching. He knew it wasn't an intruder. He'd known for a long time that the ""someone"" was Sheila herself, or rather, this other, silent presence that emerged when she slept. He couldn't understand it, couldn't explain it, but he'd tried to control it, to subdue it. He'd failed.
Months bled into a year of this erratic, bewildering existence. John, worn down by Sheila's accusations and increasingly erratic behavior, often found himself sleeping on the couch, desperate for a night of peace. He’d stopped the sedatives weeks ago, recognizing they only fueled her paranoia, not cured it. He just didn't know what else to do. The strain became unbearable. He eventually filed for divorce, taking the children with him. The silence in their once-bustling home was deafening when he left. For the first time in her life, Sheila was truly alone. And somewhere within her, Katy, the unseen force, was also alone, and increasingly restless.
The sudden solitude, the raw wound of the divorce, and the palpable distance growing between her and her children exacerbated everything. The unexplained movements in her home became more frequent, more insistent. The underwear drawer, in particular, remained Katy’s relentless focus.
One day, while navigating the bureaucratic labyrinth of her new, fractured life, Sheila remembered the calm, understanding presence of the doctor from the emergency room. She sought out Dr. Will Thompson, now in private practice. Sheila, desperate for answers, poured out her story, the years of strange occurrences, the accusations against John, the growing fear that she was losing her mind, recounting even her earlier, bizarre visit to the ER.
Will listened, truly listened, piecing together the fragments of her narrative. He noticed the subtle shifts in her demeanor, the moments of blankness in her eyes when she spoke of the nightly disturbances. He saw not a woman losing her mind, but one grappling with an unbearable internal weight. With gentle probing, he began to explore the possibility of something more profound at play.
It took months, then years, of intensive therapy – a mosaic of cognitive behavioral, dialectical, and trauma-focused approaches. Slowly, painstakingly, the truth began to emerge. The chaos, the fear, the inexplicable movements were all echoes of a buried past. Katy wasn't a phantom intruder or a figment of a paranoid mind. Katy was an alter, a distinct personality born from the profound trauma Sheila had buried deep within her, a secret she had carried since adolescence. The truth, when it finally surfaced, was a ghost from her own childhood, a predatory shadow cast by someone she had loved and trusted implicitly. Her older brother, whom she had grown up with and considered among her closest of family, had slowly groomed and molested Sheila for years. Katy, it turned out, was the silent protector, a fractured piece of herself guarding the unbearable secret of this long-ago abuse. The rearranging of furniture, the moving of clothing, and especially the fixation on the underwear drawer, were Katy’s attempts to exert control, to impose order on a chaotic internal world that Sheila herself couldn’t remember.
The revelation was both devastating and liberating. The road to integration would be long and arduous, but for the first time, Sheila had a name for the chaos, a path towards healing. She began to understand that her family hadn't abandoned her; they simply hadn’t understood the silent war raging within her. And with Will’s unwavering support, she started the long, difficult journey of reclaiming herself, piece by fragmented piece.

1lln6t1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinanceBharat/comments/1lln6t1/managing_your_finances/,Managing your Finances,"Personal finance isn’t reserved only for experts or high earners- it’s a journey anyone can embark on, starting today. Whether you’re a salaried professional, a freelancer, or a student, developing healthy money habits now lays the foundation for financial freedom tomorrow.
	1.	Track Every Expense
The first step is awareness. Record all your daily spends-coffee, groceries, snacks, subscriptions. Use a simple notebook or one of the many free mobile apps available in India. Knowing where your money goes helps you identify leaks you can plug.
	2.	Automate Your Savings
Out of sight, out of mind. Set up an auto-transfer to create an emergency fund-aim for at least three months’ worth of expenses. Many banks offer sweep-in fixed deposits with higher interest; you can also automate SIPs in a liquid fund for better returns.
	3.	Control Lifestyle Inflation
As income grows, so do expenses. Avoid succumbing to retail therapy or upgrading gadgets every year. Before making a big purchase, pause, compare prices, and ask yourself if it aligns with your long-term goals.
	4.	Start Investing Early
Time in the market beats timing the market. Begin with a small SIP in a diversified equity mutual fund or the Nifty 50 index. Over 15-20 years, compounding can turn ₹1,000 monthly into lakhs.
	5.	Diversify and Rebalance
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread investments across equity, debt, gold, and real estate (if feasible). Review your portfolio annually and rebalance to stay in line with your risk appetite and life stage.
	6.	Keep Learning and Reviewing
Financial products evolve, and so should you. Read credible blogs, watch expert videos, or join communities on Reddit and Facebook. Regularly review your goals-buying a home, children’s education, retirement-and tweak your strategy.

Remember, small consistent actions create massive impact over time. Start with one habit today-track your expenses this week-and build momentum. Your future self will thank you for the disciplines you cultivate now.

d'Annam is a fragrance house from Vietnam. It's perfumes inspire calmness and delight. My first from the brand - Vietnamese Coffee and I am super pumped.

Vietnamese coffee as the name suggests is a delightful sip of nice cold iced, slight sweet, slight bitter coffee with milk. Real pleasures, I tell you! Actually, it becomes the iconic local drink known as ""Cà Phê Sữa Đá"" .

Starts off with a grounded, tad bitter coffee powder type vibe layered with milk. Straight up smells suave and nice. As the room gets filled up with the aroma, sillage stays there for next 15mins easily and then on skin leaves an aroma of a sweet chocolaty accord. This is delicious and gives a photo-realistic cold coffee vibe. Sipping and looking at the open valley. The dry down does give a soothing vibe of some mixed florals, not too shabby and then a clean woody vibe. Stays clean throughout.

Gentle, smooth and a delightful lactonic coffee experience in a bottle. Lasts on me easily for 6 hours and it's an EDP. A true frag experiences for both genders, if one enjoys ice-cold milk coffee. ",6,1751006767.0,Perfumes,2,1.0,False

1lln582,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1lln582/long_awaited_alkemia_order_is_finally_here/,Long awaited Alkemia order is finally here - preliminary mini-reviews of 19 scents,"My most recent Alkemia order got stuck in the post for so long I actually submitting a missing parcel search for it. I contacted Alkemia about it and they said quite a few people have been having parcels take longer than normal lately (I assume due to postal service disruptions). I got no updates whatsoever until today when it suddenly, without fanfare, arrived.

I am SO desperate to wear some of these, but I know they need to rest...so in lieu of being able to properly test them yet, I'm making this post briefly reviewing what I can smell just from sniffing the bottle. I did all these mini-reviews without referring to the notes, in order to avoid being influenced in my interpretation, but I have added the notes in to this post for your convenience. I haven't bothered rating most of these, esp given many of them clearly need time to rest, but if I have a strong opinion (love or hate) I mention it. Proper reviews will come later don't worry!

**Midsummer alchemy** (*wild lilies, wisteria, honeysuckle, blossoming peach and orange trees, tulsi, bergamot, meadow grasses, and delicate jade green tea*)

Wow, I literally can’t smell anything. Maybe a faintly fresh, grassy impression, a little like green tea... I fear I may be anosmic.

**Novella (*****delicately spiced Lavender de Provence, steaming Earl Gray tea, and tattered old paperback books.*****)**

Very light and fresh, almost green-grassy. I wouldn’t have registered this as earl gray!

**Tempest and a Teacup (*****Russian black tea, shattered bone china, the ozone of passing thunderclouds, and rain-damp suede.*****)**

I get kinda lemongrass & lime shower gel from this one. I do detect a similar note as in Novella, so maybe this is just what Alkemia’s earl gray smells like - very lemony?

**Cosmic Lotus (*****sacred incense, Egyptian musk, and fully blooming lotus flowers*****)**

(a recommendation from someone here, thank you!) A kind of dark, boozy fruitiness with a bit of an incense backdrop. Not what I was expecting but quite interesting.

**High Priest (*****Sticky dank-green resins mingle with deep, dark incense, black oud, guiac wood, gurjan balsam, and warmly animalistic black amber*****)**

Oh fuck yeah this is the cannabis I want. This is IT. This is dank earthy peppery resins. Beta caryophyllene with enough sweetness and perfumeyness to not just be earthworms. It does remind me of Fyrinnae's Convergence Zone but I like this better, there’s a slightly floral quality that makes it feel more like a perfume. 10/10 (thank you to the person on here who recommended this to me when I asked for resinous cannabis perfumes!)

On the piece of tissue I spilled some of this on, it’s dried down to a light and sweet floral woody incense with very little weediness but still very very gorgeous. When I opened the parcel the whole thing smelled like Nag Champa and I thought it was from Hippie Spirit but I think it might actually have been from this perfume. (Update: the incense this dries down to is quite similar to As Dark Things Are Meant To Be Loved, which is not a bad thing at all as that's one of my favorites, but it really is VERY similar)

**Uncharted (*****West Indian Bay rum, nutmeg, pomelo, crushed seashells, allspice berries, mamoncillo, Haitian vetiver, neroli flowers, pimento, sea moss, elemi balsam, coriander, mahogany wood, and salt soaked driftwood*****)**

Smells exactly like lemon-scented detergent I’m afraid. 0/10 (hopefully this one just needs to rest)

**Hippie Spirit (*****resinous head shop incenses, sexy skin musk, slightly dirty patchouli, groovy champa blossoms, and flowering cannabis*****)**

Woah…so I was assuming this is what I was smelling throughout the package and maybe it is, but on a close sniff of the bottle it smells kind of offputting, a bit sharp and chemically, but I can definitely detect the nag champa behind everything else. Maybe needs to rest for a bit

**Lucky Money (*****The clean, metallic scent of newly minted money and the warm embrace of fresh-baked golden almond tea cookies evoke the happiness of receiving lucky red envelopes filled with good fortune.*****)**

Ooooh, this is really interesting and kind of addictive! I get an instant sour biro ink kind of note, and a kind of breadiness? I really really like this. It’s fucking weird but delicious. Confirming my suspicion that Alkemia's ""super weird"" scents are the most compatible with me. 10/10

**Sailing to Byzantium (now discontinued?! I got in just in time)** (*dried ivy leaves, lotus root, and oakmoss*; *a nostalgic whisper of Provence lavender, tonka, and mist*.)

Oh fuck this is so good. I don't know how to describe it but its oceanic as hell, fresh, but with a darkness and complexity that feels ancient and mysterious. 10/10  
if it's this good on skin, I am going to be devastated because I won't be able to acquire a full bottle.

**Book of Night (*****artemisia, oakmoss, blue juniper berries, black patchouli, sweet pipe tobacco, clove, and ritual incense resins curled up with the bedtime coziness of cashmere blanket and a steaming chai tea*****)**

Hmm, not really sure how to describe this one its kinda… vegetal? In a way that reminds me of the greengrocer. I don’t love it, may need to sit for a bit

**Cuir (single note)**

Woah! This is a dark warm smooth leather that smells for all the world like Fyrinnae's Haboob. Not what I was expecting from smelling other Alkemia leathers (e.g. Highwayman) and not sure if I’ll like it but interesting

**Tabac (single note)**

Oh my goodness, this is very sugary sweet, it smells almost identical to As Dark Things Are Meant To Be Loved to me. Odd. It's pleasant but I wouldn’t have identified it as tobacco. Will let it rest…

**Encens (single note)**

Smells quite sharp and chemically out of the bottle. Probably needs to rest. I feel like I've detected a similar note in a number of (well rested) Alkemia perfumes though

**Athame (*****melting wax candles, santalum, aloeswood and other rare ritual incense woods, and the metallic spirit of a copper athame*****)**

Hmm, strikes me as fresh and green and a bit incensey - dragons blood maybe? Rather nice, 8/10 maybe but needs to rest I think

**The Raven (*****ebony heartwood, black amber, piper nigrum, blackseed (habbatul barakah), black Bengal cardamon, black ink, nigella (black coriander), black iris, violet leaves, and leather*****)**

Licorice allsorts. Nothing like Lord of Misrule (a comparison I've seen people make) at least out of the bottle…

**Caveau des Innocents (*****tabac, dark coffee, piquant cloves, rum soaked pears, candied citron, dark caramel, and star anise bathed in intoxicating swirls of opoponax, labdanum, hashish, benzoin resinoid, vanilla incense, and guaiac wood*****)**

Ok that's caramel. And such a gorgeous caramel too. I also get a touch of coffee (and unwanted papery note?) but it's mostly that perfumey caramel. 9/10

**Book of Shadows (*****heavy parchment paper, ancient iron oak gall ink, crumbling leather bindings, and wafts of rare incenses.*****)**

Hmm, really no idea how to describe this one. It doesn’t have a lot of body. There’s a kind of freshness. Shrug. Probs needs rest

**Shine Bright My Desire (*****golden amber, star jasmine, pink lotus, and orchid swathed in patchouli boudoir incense ignited by passionate kisses of pink pepper, Ceylon cinnamon, ginger zest, and bright verbena*****)**

Idk what I’m smelling here either. Smells like an amalgam of all the sharp and soapy Alkemia smells lol. Probably needs rest or maybe my nose does…

**Viridis Arcanum (*****Turkish galbanum incense resin, Russian leather, and the fresh tips of coniferous Siberian Forest greens*****)**

Ok yeah that’s the Russian leather compost smell. Not to my taste but interested to see how it develops on skin. (I think I have enough Russian leathers now to identify that it's not a type of leather I like)",2,1751006635.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

Chovy: ""Number one is psychological warfare.""","Hey guys, on June 10th Chovy did an informal AMA stream but I haven't seen any transcriptions of it, so I made one using software. Here you go.



### **Chovy's June 2025 Q&A Session - English Translation**

**Q: Is there a place you want to travel to overseas? Or do you prefer a vacation spot for relaxation or for activities?**

**Chovy:** Can I say something like this? The place I want to go, whether overseas or for vacation... I don't need any of that. I want to go home. For me, just going home is as difficult as traveling overseas.

*(Fan Donation: HaniSyu-nim, thank you for 100 star balloons! Message: ""Long time no see."")*

**Chovy:** Hey, I'm just being honest. What can I do? Look, if I were at home all the time, I'd want to travel overseas too. But I spend more time overseas than I do at home. In a year, yes. I spend more of the year overseas than at my own home.

**Q: Can you share a playlist you've been listening to on repeat? I'm curious what you listen to.**

*(Fan Donation: ChovyVents-nim, thank you for 1,300 star balloons! Message: ""Hello Ji-hun-ah~ It's been so, so long! Always eat well and sleep well. We will always be behind you, cheering for you. Could you perhaps say a word in Vietnamese for your Vietnamese fans?"")*

**Chovy:** Oh, thank you. As for Vietnamese, this is the only thing I know: ""Cảm ơn."" It means ""thank you,"" right?

*(Fan Donation: TeddyTeddyKkyKky-nim, thank you for 33 star balloons! Message: ""Chovy perfectly dodges enemy skills, I bet he can even dodge the cheek-heart pose now. LOL, I laughed so hard I cried."")*

**Chovy:** Oh, yes, I can dodge that much. Anyway, ah, right. Let's do the AMA. The AMA won't take that long anyway, in my opinion. After that, let's just chat.

To answer the playlist question... my algorithm has been feeding me ""pop-soong"" (pop songs), and also, songs from a YouTuber named ""Hae-bi"" have been showing up in my algorithm. Hmm, that's what I've been listening to.

**Q: You said you've become a ""morning person"" due to your busy schedule. What is your personal method for overcoming fatigue?**

**Chovy:** Ah, fatigue. Right. I’ve tried, and I’ve realized there’s no way to overcome fatigue. You just… when you’re tired, yes, I sleep in the car. If I sleep in the car, it becomes a bit more bearable. And then I just think, ""Well, everyone else is living a tired life too. This is just life,"" and I carry on. There's nothing special you can do. You just live, and life goes on. There is one thing about being tired, though. If you start thinking, ""Why do I have to live like this?"" it just gets harder.

**Q: I'm so envious of your skin. Is it naturally good? If you have a skincare routine, please share your secret.**

**Chovy:** No, my skin wasn't originally good. Even now, I have something breaking out here, but it's getting better. My skin isn't that great. As for management, I used to go to a dermatologist, but it's been about 2 or 3 years since I last went. Ah, I need to go to the dermatologist to get my moles removed and get some laser hair removal here. What did I do at the dermatologist? I went there, met with the clinic manager and director, and they recommended this package and that package. I didn't know anything, so I just said, ""Ah, okay. Let's go with that."" Then they said, ""If you sign up for several months, you get a discount,"" so I said, ""Let's do that."" Hey, I have to be a sucker like that for the dermatologists to make a living, right? How else are they supposed to survive?

**Q: Please share your secret to waking up early and regularly in the morning.**

**Chovy:** First, I set about three alarms. I make sure I can get at least four hours of sleep. But lately, I don't know. On days when I don't have community service, I used to wake up at 12:30 PM. But now, on those days, even if I don't set an alarm, my eyes just open around 10 AM.

Why do I only sleep for a few hours? That's the minimum amount of sleep I have to protect. Living as a pro, I wake up at 7 AM. The reason is, I don't shower after waking up; I shower before I sleep. So I don't have to shower in the morning. I extended my sleep time that way, but there are still times I can't sleep even if I want to. Because you have to move your sleep schedule forward by three hours, and while pushing it back three hours is easy, moving it forward is not.

So, set about three alarms and go to sleep thinking, ""If I don't wake up, something terrible will happen."" Then you'll wake up.
Right, you don't have to shower in the morning. Because I shower six hours before waking up. It's been six hours since I showered, so do I really need to shower again in the morning, cutting into my precious sleep time? You save the time you would have spent showering and sleep for 30 more minutes. You say my face gets oily? Sleeping 30 more minutes is more vital for survival than having an oily face.

**Q: If you woke up in the world of *Squid Game*, what would you do?**

**Chovy:** (I don't know why there's a question like this, but...) If I woke up in the world of *Squid Game*... yes, I would go back to sleep. If I sleep again, I'll probably return to reality, right?

**Q: What job would you most want to have if you weren't a pro gamer?**

**Chovy:** Uh… I probably would have been a game streamer. I think I would have streamed a variety of different games. Because I have so many games I want to play. So yeah, I’d play a bunch of different games.

**Q: Which came first, the chicken or the egg?**

**Chovy:** It's a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situation. (Lit: ""If you hang it on your nose, it's a nose ring; if you hang it on your ear, it's an earring."")

**Q: What game have you been into lately?**

**Chovy:** The game I've been into lately is... *GunZ*. The OG game of skill.

**Q: You used to wear glasses, but you don't these days. Why?**

**Chovy:** They were blue-light-blocking glasses. Yes. But when I wore the blue-light-blocking glasses, the blue light comes from the monitor, and blocking it before it reached my eyes made my reaction time feel slower. So I don't wear them anymore.

**Q: Is there a food you're into lately or eat often?**

**Chovy:** What do I eat... Water. Yes. I drink a lot of water. I just drank a Zero Coke, and I think it's the first one I've had in a week. It’s not that I have a specific food I like; it's more that I consider the nutrients. I ask myself, ""Is this nutritionally sound?"" From that perspective, I eat hamburgers often because they are nutritionally balanced. Ah, coffee? My body doesn't handle coffee well. [Music] When I consume caffeine, my body can't regulate its temperature properly. It makes me tired.

**Q: In an interview, you said you like Japanese culture. If you were to go to Japan, where would you go?**

**Chovy:** To be honest, I haven't thought about it in detail. I'd have to experience the atmosphere of a Japanese street first. Sapporo? Right. I was actually thinking about Sapporo. I was thinking, ""If I were to go, maybe I should check out Sapporo."" How did you guess? Isn't Sapporo famous for its heavy snow? To be honest, if I were to actually go, I'd need at least two and a half months, so I haven't looked into it properly.

**Q: We've often seen you play top lane in solo queue. Do you ever think about switching your position to top?**

**Chovy:** As a pro gamer, I wouldn't change my position, but if I were a regular person, I might play top lane often. But honestly, if it got to the point where I was switching from mid to top, I'd probably just quit LoL.

**Q: To improve laning phase skills, what are the top 3 advanced techniques one must learn?**

**Chovy:** 1. Psychological warfare. 2. Minion ma-... ah, this is hard to explain with words, but there's a thing with minions. The ranged minions have a specific attack animation, and you have to interact with it well. All former pros will know this. Based on the ranged minion's animation, you know what action you need to take to get the maximum benefit. You know that thing when minions are crashing into the tower? If a low-health ranged minion is at the front, you intentionally tank one tower shot. During the auto-attack delay, the minion that was attacking you moves back, right? Then the minion that enters tower range is a full-health one. The order changes. [Music] But the thing is, when I explain this... I think there are people who understand what I just said, and people who don't. That's how it's divided. People who need to see a video or a visual aid to get it. So you can think of it like this: if you heard that and a picture formed in your mind, you're in the group that gets it. If you think, ""I can't picture that,"" you're in the group that doesn't. This isn't a matter of comprehension ability, but a difference in your understanding of LoL. That's how it's divided. It depends on your level of understanding of how to interact with minion movements.

**Q: How do you perfectly track the enemy jungler's pathing?**

**Chovy:** I don't track the jungle pathing perfectly, but if you have vision in the enemy jungle, jungle camp rotations are pretty standardized these days, so you can get a rough idea of their location. As long as you have the information.

**Q: A champion you genuinely love?**

**Chovy:** I don't think I have one. I like the champion with the highest win rate.

**Q: Is there a champion you personally believe you are the world's number one on?**

**Chovy:** As of right now, I think I'm the best at Taliyah.

**Q: You're praised for being in your best form. Can you share a secret to continuously elevating your skills?**

**Chovy:** I don't know the answer to this one either. Because structurally, my practice time this year has decreased compared to previous years. It's structurally impossible for it to be more, since I have to sleep early and wake up early. So personally, my practice time has gone down, but my gameplay has gotten better. It makes me wonder... is it because I'm staying away from solo queue? I'm starting to think that. [Music] I think playing solo queue accumulates ""contaminated data"" in my brain. I don't think there's any other reason. Because when I think about it, there's no other reason for me to be better this year. [Music] There's nothing else.

**Q: Do you use smartcast?**

**Chovy:** Yes, I use it by default. The champions I don't use it on are Taliyah, Viktor, and Rumble.

**Q: If you win Worlds, what champion skin would you want to be made? Any champions you've already picked out?**

**Chovy:** I think I'd pick Taliyah. I think I'd also pick Galio. What do you mean, ""don't talk about skins""? Have I ever had a year where I didn't talk about skins? Yes, there have been years I didn't, but just because you don't talk about it doesn't mean it won't happen. For now, I'm thinking of Taliyah and Galio. Galio seems pretty cool. If I got a Galio skin and it was slightly black-colored, yes, I think that would be nice.

**Q: When a game isn't going well during practice or a tournament, how do you manage your mentality?**

**Chovy:** In a tournament, if I think ""it's doomed,"" then I just focus on finding the best possible outcome from that doomed situation. In solo queue, if it's doomed, I just think, ""Yep, solo queue is a broken game no matter what you do,"" and just let it go. In solo queue, whether I let go of my mentality or not, the game will somehow become winnable if I just do what I'm supposed to do. There is this, though. Since I've played a lot of LoL, even if I lose my mental focus, my brain and hands are already automated to make the best possible plays. So whether I'm focused or not, solo queue games just eventually become winnable.

*(Fan Donation: Jinnier-nim, thank you for 100 star balloons!)*

**Q: When everyone on your team is losing their lane, but you are carrying, do you feel hot-headed or cold-headed?**

**Chovy:** I don't know if this is for tournaments or solo queue, but for tournaments, I get cold-headed. For solo queue, I get hot-headed. ""Why is the game like this when I'm playing like this?"" I think, as my body starts to heat up.

**Q: A champion you are truly fond of?**

**Chovy:** I don't have one. I said this earlier. I said I don't have a favorite champion.

**Q: What is your most memorable moment from this season?**

**Chovy:** Hmm, I don't think I have one. ""Senpai-nim"" in the chat? What's that? Oh, my penta. Right, I got a pentakill. But a pentakill isn't that memorable to me. ""The Senpai-nim question""? Oh, the penta. But they happen pretty often these days, so their scarcity value has dropped. I don't think it was that big of a deal.

**Q: Signature pick?**

**Chovy:** I don't know. I feel like I just play whatever champions came out recently. Ah, my signature champion... I do think it's Aurelion Sol. During that MSI, when I picked Aurelion Sol, I just didn't feel like we could lose the game.

**Q: In-game settings?**

**Chovy:** In-game is fixed at 50 sensitivity. My DPI changes day to day depending on my condition. It's been decreasing by 50 each year. Right now, it's 1450.

**Q: Since you've gained some weight, ""LeanChovy"" is out. If you had to change your ID, what would you change it to?**

**Chovy:** Since ""LeanChovy"" is out, I'll go with Chovy.

**Q: Pro players sit in front of the computer for a long time. Do you do anything to manage your eyes, back, or wrists?**

**Chovy:** Uh, yes, I do manage them. But honestly, even if you don't manage them, I think as long as your posture is good, it's fine. To be a pro for a long time, I think this. Even if I weren't a pro, I'd probably be sitting and gaming this much anyway. So rather than posture management, I think mind management is more important. Mental health.

**Q: (Question about interviews)**

**Chovy:** Hmm, yes. That thought... yes. In the past, during interviews, I'd think, ""This is an official setting, what if I misspeak?"" and I'd filter my words in my brain and...

*(Fan Donation: Thank you, Jinni.)*

**Chovy:** ...but recently, I don't think I'm likely to misspeak that badly. And even if I do misspeak a little, it's not like I'm going to die or anything. I realized that, yeah, it's not a big deal. As I experience more things in this world, I think, ""Ah, this is nothing,"" and I just do it, and it works out.

**Q: If you could become one LoL champion, who would you choose?**

**Chovy:** Hmm... [Music] I would choose Shen. When we have to take long-haul flights overseas for tournaments, right? I'd send my luggage ahead first. I'd send the luggage, rest up, and then take Shen's ultimate to get there. Hey, Twisted Fate has a 5,500 range limit. You guys aren't thinking hard enough. Anyway, I'd use the ultimate. For me, teleportation has the greatest value. ""But your ally has to go first..."" Then just send the team on the plane first! If I send my teammates ahead on the flight, then I don't have to take that flight, so I can rest and then go, right? ""Who would you send?"" Well, anyone can go.

**Q: What do fans say that gives you the most strength?**

**Chovy:** Ah... I don't know. To be honest, it was kind of like this. I don't really feel the emotion of ""I gain strength because of something a fan said"" that strongly. Just the fact that fans are cheering for me is in itself a source of strength. It's not like they have to say a specific thing for me to feel strong. So... I don't know.

But these people are ridiculous. They're saying, ""So what, we don't give you strength?"" You have to listen to the end of what a Korean person says.

*(Fan Donation: GachoMitchulbi-nim, thank you for 1,000 star balloons! Message: ""As expected of Dae-hwan-bi (play on Chovy's name + fan love)."")*

**Chovy:** Ah, thank you. As they say, ""A single word can pay off a thousand nyang debt."" A single word can also get you 1,000 star balloons. Thank you.

**Q: Favorite... [Music] top lane champion?**

**Chovy:** I don't have one. Yes. Why would I need to play top?

**Q: What is your personal tier list for the Gen.G players in Arena?**

**Chovy:** First, uh... Peyz and Canyon are Tier 1. Young-jae (Kiin) and Hyeok-gyu (Lehends)... if there are 5 tiers, they would be Tier 4 or 5. Ruler would be around Tier 3-4. And I would be Tier 1-2. There's a really logical reason for this. Young-jae (Kiin) builds weird items. Hyeok-gyu (Lehends) doesn't read the descriptions for the Arena items, so he doesn't know what's good. Since he doesn't know what's good, he won't pick a good item even if it appears. That's why it ends up that way.

**Q: Is there a player you want to team up with in Arena to prove you can get 1st place?**

**Chovy:** Wang-ho (Peanut). I still haven't proven I can get 1st with Wang-ho, but then Arena ended.

*(Fan Donation: ChovyVamp-nim, thank you for 1,300 star balloons! Message: ""It's been so long since I've seen you stream. Are you eating and sleeping well these days? Wang-ho-ssi, please take care of your health! Chovy and Gen.G, I'm cheering for you to win MSI! We Vietnamese fans believe you will definitely do it!"")*

**Chovy:** Oh, thank you. Cảm ơn, cảm ơn.

**Q: Which teammate do you prefer to team with the most? And the least?**

**Chovy:** [Music] Ah, for the player I prefer... I think Ji-hoon (Doran) and Min-gyu (Canyon) are the most fun. Jae-hyeok (Ruler) is fun too. But actually, they're all fun. They're all fun to play with. But if we absolutely have to win, I think teaming up with Gwon-bo (Peyz) gives the highest win rate.

**Q: If you had to play only one champion for the rest of your life, who would it be?**

**Chovy:** If I had to play just one for life... [Music] I would choose Orianna. Because if you play Zoe for 100 games, the results will have high variance across all 100 games. But if I only play Orianna? Honestly, I think I could produce a similar expected value across all 100 games. [Music] Hmm.

**Q: How do you manage your schedule?**

**Chovy:** You just reduce your personal time. I have to get my community service done quickly, so I use my personal time during vacation to do it, and I also do it when there's a long time before the next match.

**Q: Soul champion?**

**Chovy:** Stop asking this. I told you, I don't have a soul champion. Sheesh, why are there so many of these champion questions?

**Q: I am sincerely waiting for you to come to Japan one day.**

**Chovy:** Thank you. If I get a chance to go someday, I will. Hey, I asked about this. I said, ""What if there are weird questions in this list?"" They told me, ""Don't worry, we filtered them out."" But there are so many of these... these repetitive... 응... questions.

**Q: If you were given the choice again... mid lane?**

**Chovy:** Mid. I must play the mid position. Yes. I must. There are many reasons for it.

**Q: Is there a non-mid champion that has caught your eye?**

**Chovy:** [Music] I'm really good at stacking Senna's souls.

**Q: To endure a long season, mental fortitude is important. How do you handle your emotions on and off stage?**

**Chovy:** Uh, in the past, I worried about it. ""Am I living without emotions?"" But recently, I've come to really like living without emotions. In this world that makes you angry, for my own emotions to be tranquil... as I get older, I've started to think, ""Ah, this is a good thing."" I like living without emotion. When necessary emotions are needed, well... [Music] I suppose they're necessary then.

**Q: A final word on your aspirations and a message to the fans?**

**Chovy:** Aspirations? What's there to say? Just saying, ""I'll go and do well,"" is enough. For a pro, yes, there's no need for fancy words. Just being good is the best result. That's what I think.

---

### **Post-AMA Banter**

**Chovy:** Well, that's everything. [Music] Yes. ""What is there to acknowledge?"" ""Admit it."" What is there to... Ah, communication. We have to communicate. This AMA, it's that thing, you know? You guys know what I mean. 응. That... you know... the connection between us people... that thing we have to do... that stuff. You know what I'm talking about. Let's just do well.

*(Fan Donation: Fashion-Min-nim, thank you for 100 star balloons! Message: ""Are you satisfied with the time and money you spent on dermatology and orthodontics, or do you regret it?"")*

**Chovy:** I'm satisfied with the time and money I spent. Yes, I'm satisfied.

**Chovy:** ""Is it okay to do community service when you're not streaming?"" It's actually more comfortable to do it when I'm not streaming. Because I was originally supposed to go tomorrow, on the 9th, but today's stream time was ""must be from 10 to 2."" There's no way I can... ""Sing a song, I miss it so much, the spaghetti song."" Right. But I'm not going to sing. Probably. If I had to stream as well, I probably couldn't have gone to community service because of condition management.

""What do you think about the student tryouts being during exam season?"" Yes, fighting!

""Among the students you're coaching, is there anyone with... let's not say 'a bud of talent,' let's say 'potential'?"" Yes... potential... Yes... I don't really know. Because I'd have to see many students, but I've only seen two mid-laner students. So, I haven't seen them scrim, only their solo queue. But fundamentally, they have talent. Because they're at that level at a young age.

""Are you going to raise the new Blade Dancer class in MapleStory?"" Hey, I'm a LoL pro doing a LoL stream...

**Chovy:** Thank you. I saw it! Yes, I saw it. I came, I saw, and wow... I really... I feel like I've been waiting for a character with that concept for all 25 years of my life. For this moment. How did they know I'm crazy for ""Maehwa"" (Plum Blossom) sword skills? Really... Ah... Ah... For real, if I raise this character this time, ah... I feel like I'm going to pour an immense amount of affection into it.

""Are you abandoning your main?"" It's not abandoning, it's just being pushed aside. Everyone, listen. If you have children, a first and a second child, and the second child was just born, you'd give them more attention, right? That's what it's like. 응. If the second child is born later, the younger one gets more attention and affection. You can't help it. ...Yes, I am the second child.

""Explain your nickname."" Ugh, if I use the nickname I always use, annoying things happen. So I just change my nickname. I just don't want to deal with the hassle.

""The background music is too gloomy."" This is the LoL BGM. My... is it my bag? Collection... I've entered the Collection tab now. The BGM won't play now. The BGM is a bit gloomy.

[Music]

""Which game have you spent the most money on?"" It's tough... LoL, Valorant...

*(Fan Donation: Dorodorodi-nim, thank you for 100 star balloons! Message: ""Chovy-nim, your emotions seem to come alive when you talk about MapleStory."")*

**Chovy:** Yeah, my emotions do seem to come alive. Ah, it's fun. A person needs to have a hobby.

""Do you like your back hair long or short?"" I got my back hair cleaned up for the first time in a few months, and...

*(Fan Donation: Utachi-nim is now frozen. ""Chovy-nim, you know that not wearing transparent shoes shows you're a noob, right?"")*

**Chovy:** It's not that I'm not wearing transparent shoes, I gave the ones I was using to my sub-character. Ahem. Anyway. I cleaned up my back hair, but I think I prefer it long. As long as it's not too messy.

""A girlfriend like Yoru or a girlfriend like Jett?"" I don't know why you'd ask a question like that. Don't ask questions like that.

""Just based on personality..."" Just personality? Based only on personality, Min-gyu's (Canyon) personality is really fun. He's genuinely a fun person. But a girlfriend *like* Min-gyu... that's not easy. If you imagine a female Min-gyu... Ah... my brow just furrows. I want to stop talking about this topic.

""Thank you for recommending 'The Swordmaster's Son,' I really enjoyed it."" Ah, that one is really fun. ""The Swordmaster's Son"" is great, and most webtoons with a fantasy element are fun. But I remember when I recommended that webtoon, someone's facial expression when they said, ""Ah, I don't like romance stuff..."" I think I remember that. Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it anyway.

""Mid laner's CS per minute in solo queue?"" Mid... Mid... You guys are saying it well. The era has changed for mid lane. It doesn't matter anymore if a mid laner gets good CS per minute or not. You just have to not miss the last hits on the CS that are right in front of your eyes. If there's no CS in front of you, you'll be using that tempo somewhere else. You're not just going to be AFK in the fountain, right? You'll use your turn top, or bot, or Baron, or Dragon. As long as you don't miss the last hits when you're in lane... CS per minute is unnecessary.

""But you get a lot..."" That's because I'm good at getting it. The CS that's in front of my eyes. When you look at people pushing side lanes, there are those who just use skills and push the wave without getting the last hits. They use skills, but don't last hit. If you don't last hit, you don't get gold. You have to be someone who gets the last hit. When you guys have CS leakage, you think, ""I did well in lane, why is my CS so low?"" It's because you're missing it in the side lanes. Usually.

No, I'm not angry. We're having a passionate debate. Everyone, if I get genuinely angry while talking about LoL, you won't be able to handle it. You'll probably quit LoL. If you discuss LoL with me and I get angry, you'll think, ""LoL is too hard and what Chovy said about it is bull****,"" and you'll quit.

On that note, I'm going to the bathroom.

...Ah, but this hair...

*(Fan Subscription: BlackAewon-nim, thank you for the 16-month subscription!)*

**Chovy:** I'm back. Okay. So, I have to do a stream once. They said I have to change the settings after the AMA is over. So I have to turn off the stream and turn it back on. Don't blame me. I'm not the one doing it. I don't want to turn off the stream either. It's a hassle for me too. But what can you do? That's life. You all have to share in my annoyance and accept it with me.

### **Chovy's May 2025 Q&A Session - English Translation**

**Q: Is there a place you want to travel to overseas? Or do you prefer a vacation spot for relaxation or for activities?**

**Chovy:** Can I say something like this? The place I want to go, whether overseas or for vacation... I don't need any of that. I want to go home. For me, just going home is as difficult as traveling overseas.

*(Fan Donation: HaniSyu-nim, thank you for 100 star balloons! Message: ""Long time no see."")*

**Chovy:** Hey, I'm just being honest. What can I do? Look, if I were at home all the time, I'd want to travel overseas too. But I spend more time overseas than I do at home. In a year, yes. I spend more of the year overseas than at my own home.

**Q: Can you share a playlist you've been listening to on repeat? I'm curious what you listen to.**

*(Fan Donation: ChovyVents-nim, thank you for 1,300 star balloons! Message: ""Hello Ji-hun-ah~ It's been so, so long! Always eat well and sleep well. We will always be behind you, cheering for you. Could you perhaps say a word in Vietnamese for your Vietnamese fans?"")*

**Chovy:** Oh, thank you. As for Vietnamese, this is the only thing I know: ""Cảm ơn."" It means ""thank you,"" right?

*(Fan Donation: TeddyTeddyKkyKky-nim, thank you for 33 star balloons! Message: ""Chovy perfectly dodges enemy skills, I bet he can even dodge the cheek-heart pose now. LOL, I laughed so hard I cried."")*

**Chovy:** Oh, yes, I can dodge that much. Anyway, ah, right. Let's do the AMA. The AMA won't take that long anyway, in my opinion. After that, let's just chat.

To answer the playlist question... my algorithm has been feeding me ""pop-soong"" (pop songs), and also, songs from a YouTuber named ""Hae-bi"" have been showing up in my algorithm. Hmm, that's what I've been listening to.

**Q: You said you've become a ""morning person"" due to your busy schedule. What is your personal method for overcoming fatigue?**

**Chovy:** Ah, fatigue. Right. I’ve tried, and I’ve realized there’s no way to overcome fatigue. You just… when you’re tired, yes, I sleep in the car. If I sleep in the car, it becomes a bit more bearable. And then I just think, ""Well, everyone else is living a tired life too. This is just life,"" and I carry on. There's nothing special you can do. You just live, and life goes on. There is one thing about being tired, though. If you start thinking, ""Why do I have to live like this?"" it just gets harder.

**Q: I'm so envious of your skin. Is it naturally good? If you have a skincare routine, please share your secret.**

**Chovy:** No, my skin wasn't originally good. Even now, I have something breaking out here, but it's getting better. My skin isn't that great. As for management, I used to go to a dermatologist, but it's been about 2 or 3 years since I last went. Ah, I need to go to the dermatologist to get my moles removed and get some laser hair removal here. What did I do at the dermatologist? I went there, met with the clinic manager and director, and they recommended this package and that package. I didn't know anything, so I just said, ""Ah, okay. Let's go with that."" Then they said, ""If you sign up for several months, you get a discount,"" so I said, ""Let's do that."" Hey, I have to be a sucker like that for the dermatologists to make a living, right? How else are they supposed to survive?

**Q: Please share your secret to waking up early and regularly in the morning.**

**Chovy:** First, I set about three alarms. I make sure I can get at least four hours of sleep. But lately, I don't know. On days when I don't have community service, I used to wake up at 12:30 PM. But now, on those days, even if I don't set an alarm, my eyes just open around 10 AM.

Why do I only sleep for a few hours? That's the minimum amount of sleep I have to protect. Living as a pro, I wake up at 7 AM. The reason is, I don't shower after waking up; I shower before I sleep. So I don't have to shower in the morning. I extended my sleep time that way, but there are still times I can't sleep even if I want to. Because you have to move your sleep schedule forward by three hours, and while pushing it back three hours is easy, moving it forward is not.

So, set about three alarms and go to sleep thinking, ""If I don't wake up, something terrible will happen."" Then you'll wake up.
Right, you don't have to shower in the morning. Because I shower six hours before waking up. It's been six hours since I showered, so do I really need to shower again in the morning, cutting into my precious sleep time? You save the time you would have spent showering and sleep for 30 more minutes. You say my face gets oily? Sleeping 30 more minutes is more vital for survival than having an oily face.

**Q: If you woke up in the world of *Squid Game*, what would you do?**

**Chovy:** (I don't know why there's a question like this, but...) If I woke up in the world of *Squid Game*... yes, I would go back to sleep. If I sleep again, I'll probably return to reality, right?

**Q: What job would you most want to have if you weren't a pro gamer?**

**Chovy:** Uh… I probably would have been a game streamer. I think I would have streamed a variety of different games. Because I have so many games I want to play. So yeah, I’d play a bunch of different games.

**Q: Which came first, the chicken or the egg?**

**Chovy:** It's a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situation. (Lit: ""If you hang it on your nose, it's a nose ring; if you hang it on your ear, it's an earring."")

**Q: What game have you been into lately?**

**Chovy:** The game I've been into lately is... *GunZ*. The OG game of skill.

**Q: You used to wear glasses, but you don't these days. Why?**

**Chovy:** They were blue-light-blocking glasses. Yes. But when I wore the blue-light-blocking glasses, the blue light comes from the monitor, and blocking it before it reached my eyes made my reaction time feel slower. So I don't wear them anymore.

**Q: Is there a food you're into lately or eat often?**

**Chovy:** What do I eat... Water. Yes. I drink a lot of water. I just drank a Zero Coke, and I think it's the first one I've had in a week. It’s not that I have a specific food I like; it's more that I consider the nutrients. I ask myself, ""Is this nutritionally sound?"" From that perspective, I eat hamburgers often because they are nutritionally balanced. Ah, coffee? My body doesn't handle coffee well. [Music] When I consume caffeine, my body can't regulate its temperature properly. It makes me tired.

**Q: In an interview, you said you like Japanese culture. If you were to go to Japan, where would you go?**

**Chovy:** To be honest, I haven't thought about it in detail. I'd have to experience the atmosphere of a Japanese street first. Sapporo? Right. I was actually thinking about Sapporo. I was thinking, ""If I were to go, maybe I should check out Sapporo."" How did you guess? Isn't Sapporo famous for its heavy snow? To be honest, if I were to actually go, I'd need at least two and a half months, so I haven't looked into it properly.

**Q: We've often seen you play top lane in solo queue. Do you ever think about switching your position to top?**

**Chovy:** As a pro gamer, I wouldn't change my position, but if I were a regular person, I might play top lane often. But honestly, if it got to the point where I was switching from mid to top, I'd probably just quit LoL.

**Q: To improve laning phase skills, what are the top 3 advanced techniques one must learn?**

**Chovy:** 1. Psychological warfare. 2. Minion ma-... ah, this is hard to explain with words, but there's a thing with minions. The ranged minions have a specific attack animation, and you have to interact with it well. All former pros will know this. Based on the ranged minion's animation, you know what action you need to take to get the maximum benefit. You know that thing when minions are crashing into the tower? If a low-health ranged minion is at the front, you intentionally tank one tower shot. During the auto-attack delay, the minion that was attacking you moves back, right? Then the minion that enters tower range is a full-health one. The order changes. [Music] But the thing is, when I explain this... I think there are people who understand what I just said, and people who don't. That's how it's divided. People who need to see a video or a visual aid to get it. So you can think of it like this: if you heard that and a picture formed in your mind, you're in the group that gets it. If you think, ""I can't picture that,"" you're in the group that doesn't. This isn't a matter of comprehension ability, but a difference in your understanding of LoL. That's how it's divided. It depends on your level of understanding of how to interact with minion movements.

**Q: How do you perfectly track the enemy jungler's pathing?**

**Chovy:** I don't track the jungle pathing perfectly, but if you have vision in the enemy jungle, jungle camp rotations are pretty standardized these days, so you can get a rough idea of their location. As long as you have the information.

**Q: A champion you genuinely love?**

**Chovy:** I don't think I have one. I like the champion with the highest win rate.

**Q: Is there a champion you personally believe you are the world's number one on?**

**Chovy:** As of right now, I think I'm the best at Taliyah.

**Q: You're praised for being in your best form. Can you share a secret to continuously elevating your skills?**

**Chovy:** I don't know the answer to this one either. Because structurally, my practice time this year has decreased compared to previous years. It's structurally impossible for it to be more, since I have to sleep early and wake up early. So personally, my practice time has gone down, but my gameplay has gotten better. It makes me wonder... is it because I'm staying away from solo queue? I'm starting to think that. [Music] I think playing solo queue accumulates ""contaminated data"" in my brain. I don't think there's any other reason. Because when I think about it, there's no other reason for me to be better this year. [Music] There's nothing else.

**Q: Do you use smartcast?**

**Chovy:** Yes, I use it by default. The champions I don't use it on are Taliyah, Viktor, and Rumble.

**Q: If you win Worlds, what champion skin would you want to be made? Any champions you've already picked out?**

**Chovy:** I think I'd pick Taliyah. I think I'd also pick Galio. What do you mean, ""don't talk about skins""? Have I ever had a year where I didn't talk about skins? Yes, there have been years I didn't, but just because you don't talk about it doesn't mean it won't happen. For now, I'm thinking of Taliyah and Galio. Galio seems pretty cool. If I got a Galio skin and it was slightly black-colored, yes, I think that would be nice.

**Q: When a game isn't going well during practice or a tournament, how do you manage your mentality?**

**Chovy:** In a tournament, if I think ""it's doomed,"" then I just focus on finding the best possible outcome from that doomed situation. In solo queue, if it's doomed, I just think, ""Yep, solo queue is a broken game no matter what you do,"" and just let it go. In solo queue, whether I let go of my mentality or not, the game will somehow become winnable if I just do what I'm supposed to do. There is this, though. Since I've played a lot of LoL, even if I lose my mental focus, my brain and hands are already automated to make the best possible plays. So whether I'm focused or not, solo queue games just eventually become winnable.

**Q: When everyone on your team is losing their lane, but you are carrying, do you feel hot-headed or cold-headed?**

**Chovy:** I don't know if this is for tournaments or solo queue, but for tournaments, I get cold-headed. For solo queue, I get hot-headed. ""Why is the game like this when I'm playing like this?"" I think, as my body starts to heat up.

**Q: A champion you are truly fond of?**

**Chovy:** I don't have one. I said this earlier. I said I don't have a favorite champion.

**Q: What is your most memorable moment from this season?**

**Chovy:** Hmm, I don't think I have one. ""Senpai-nim"" in the chat? What's that? Oh, my penta. Right, I got a pentakill. But a pentakill isn't that memorable to me. ""The Senpai-nim question""? Oh, the penta. But they happen pretty often these days, so their scarcity value has dropped. I don't think it was that big of a deal.

**Q: Signature pick?**

**Chovy:** I don't know. I feel like I just play whatever champions came out recently. Ah, my signature champion... I do think it's Aurelion Sol. During that MSI, when I picked Aurelion Sol, I just didn't feel like we could lose the game.

**Q: In-game settings?**

**Chovy:** In-game is fixed at 50 sensitivity. My DPI changes day to day depending on my condition. It's been decreasing by 50 each year. Right now, it's 1450.

**Q: Since you've gained some weight, ""LeanChovy"" is out. If you had to change your ID, what would you change it to?**

**Chovy:** Since ""LeanChovy"" is out, I'll go with Chovy.

**Q: Pro players sit in front of the computer for a long time. Do you do anything to manage your eyes, back, or wrists?**

**Chovy:** Uh, yes, I do manage them. But honestly, even if you don't manage them, I think as long as your posture is good, it's fine. To be a pro for a long time, I think this. Even if I weren't a pro, I'd probably be sitting and gaming this much anyway. So rather than posture management, I think mind management is more important. Mental health.

**Q: (Question about interviews)**

**Chovy:** Hmm, yes. That thought... yes. In the past, during interviews, I'd think, ""This is an official setting, what if I misspeak?"" and I'd filter my words in my brain and...

*(Fan Donation: Thank you, Jinni.)*

**Chovy:** ...but recently, I don't think I'm likely to misspeak that badly. And even if I do misspeak a little, it's not like I'm going to die or anything. I realized that, yeah, it's not a big deal. As I experience more things in this world, I think, ""Ah, this is nothing,"" and I just do it, and it works out.

**Q: If you could become one LoL champion, who would you choose?**

**Chovy:** Hmm... [Music] I would choose Shen. When we have to take long-haul flights overseas for tournaments, right? I'd send my luggage ahead first. I'd send the luggage, rest up, and then take Shen's ultimate to get there. Hey, Twisted Fate has a 5,500 range limit. You guys aren't thinking hard enough. Anyway, I'd use the ultimate. For me, teleportation has the greatest value. ""But your ally has to go first..."" Then just send the team on the plane first! If I send my teammates ahead on the flight, then I don't have to take that flight, so I can rest and then go, right? ""Who would you send?"" Well, anyone can go.

**Q: What do fans say that gives you the most strength?**

**Chovy:** Ah... I don't know. To be honest, it was kind of like this. I don't really feel the emotion of ""I gain strength because of something a fan said"" that strongly. Just the fact that fans are cheering for me is in itself a source of strength. It's not like they have to say a specific thing for me to feel strong. So... I don't know.

But these people are ridiculous. They're saying, ""So what, we don't give you strength?"" You have to listen to the end of what a Korean person says.

**Chovy:** Ah, thank you. As they say, ""A single word can pay off a thousand nyang debt."" A single word can also get you 1,000 star balloons. Thank you.

**Q: Favorite... [Music] top lane champion?**

**Chovy:** I don't have one. Yes. Why would I need to play top?

**Q: What is your personal tier list for the Gen.G players in Arena?**

**Chovy:** First, uh... Peyz and Canyon are Tier 1. Young-jae (Kiin) and Hyeok-gyu (Lehends)... if there are 5 tiers, they would be Tier 4 or 5. Ruler would be around Tier 3-4. And I would be Tier 1-2. There's a really logical reason for this. Young-jae (Kiin) builds weird items. Hyeok-gyu (Lehends) doesn't read the descriptions for the Arena items, so he doesn't know what's good. Since he doesn't know what's good, he won't pick a good item even if it appears. That's why it ends up that way.

**Q: Is there a player you want to team up with in Arena to prove you can get 1st place?**

**Chovy:** Wang-ho (Peanut). I still haven't proven I can get 1st with Wang-ho, but then Arena ended.

*(Fan Donation: ChovyVamp-nim, thank you for 1,300 star balloons! Message: ""It's been so long since I've seen you stream. Are you eating and sleeping well these days? Wang-ho-ssi, please take care of your health! Chovy and Gen.G, I'm cheering for you to win MSI! We Vietnamese fans believe you will definitely do it!"")*

**Chovy:** Oh, thank you. Cảm ơn, cảm ơn.

**Q: Which teammate do you prefer to team with the most? And the least?**

**Chovy:** [Music] Ah, for the player I prefer... I think Ji-hoon (Doran) and Min-gyu (Canyon) are the most fun. Jae-hyeok (Ruler) is fun too. But actually, they're all fun. They're all fun to play with. But if we absolutely have to win, I think teaming up with Gwon-bo (Peyz) gives the highest win rate.

**Q: If you had to play only one champion for the rest of your life, who would it be?**

**Chovy:** If I had to play just one for life... [Music] I would choose Orianna. Because if you play Zoe for 100 games, the results will have high variance across all 100 games. But if I only play Orianna? Honestly, I think I could produce a similar expected value across all 100 games. [Music] Hmm.

**Q: How do you manage your schedule?**

**Chovy:** You just reduce your personal time. I have to get my community service done quickly, so I use my personal time during vacation to do it, and I also do it when there's a long time before the next match.

**Q: Soul champion?**

**Chovy:** Stop asking this. I told you, I don't have a soul champion. Sheesh, why are there so many of these champion questions?

**Q: I am sincerely waiting for you to come to Japan one day.**

**Chovy:** Thank you. If I get a chance to go someday, I will. Hey, I asked about this. I said, ""What if there are weird questions in this list?"" They told me, ""Don't worry, we filtered them out."" But there are so many of these... these repetitive... 응... questions.

**Q: If you were given the choice again... mid lane?**

**Chovy:** Mid. I must play the mid position. Yes. I must. There are many reasons for it.

**Q: Is there a non-mid champion that has caught your eye?**

**Chovy:** [Music] I'm really good at stacking Senna's souls.

**Q: To endure a long season, mental fortitude is important. How do you handle your emotions on and off stage?**

**Chovy:** Uh, in the past, I worried about it. ""Am I living without emotions?"" But recently, I've come to really like living without emotions. In this world that makes you angry, for my own emotions to be tranquil... as I get older, I've started to think, ""Ah, this is a good thing."" I like living without emotion. When necessary emotions are needed, well... [Music] I suppose they're necessary then.

**Q: A final word on your aspirations and a message to the fans?**

**Chovy:** Aspirations? What's there to say? Just saying, ""I'll go and do well,"" is enough. For a pro, yes, there's no need for fancy words. Just being good is the best result. That's what I think.

---

### **Post-AMA Banter**

**Chovy:** Well, that's everything. [Music] Yes. ""What is there to acknowledge?"" ""Admit it."" What is there to... Ah, communication. We have to communicate. This AMA, it's that thing, you know? You guys know what I mean. 응. That... you know... the connection between us people... that thing we have to do... that stuff. You know what I'm talking about. Let's just do well.

**Chovy:** I'm satisfied with the time and money I spent. Yes, I'm satisfied.

**Chovy:** ""Is it okay to do community service when you're not streaming?"" It's actually more comfortable to do it when I'm not streaming. Because I was originally supposed to go tomorrow, on the 9th, but today's stream time was ""must be from 10 to 2."" There's no way I can... ""Sing a song, I miss it so much, the spaghetti song."" Right. But I'm not going to sing. Probably. If I had to stream as well, I probably couldn't have gone to community service because of condition management.

""What do you think about the student tryouts being during exam season?"" Yes, fighting!

""Among the students you're coaching, is there anyone with... let's not say 'a bud of talent,' let's say 'potential'?"" Yes... potential... Yes... I don't really know. Because I'd have to see many students, but I've only seen two mid-laner students. So, I haven't seen them scrim, only their solo queue. But fundamentally, they have talent. Because they're at that level at a young age.

If the second child is born later, the younger one gets more attention and affection. You can't help it. ...Yes, I am the second child.

""Thank you for recommending 'The Swordmaster's Son,' I really enjoyed it."" Ah, that one is really fun. ""The Swordmaster's Son"" is great, and most webtoons with a fantasy element are fun. But I remember when I recommended that webtoon, someone's facial expression when they said, ""Ah, I don't like romance stuff..."" I think I remember that. Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it anyway.

""Mid laner's CS per minute in solo queue?"" Mid... Mid... You guys are saying it well. The era has changed for mid lane. It doesn't matter anymore if a mid laner gets good CS per minute or not. You just have to not miss the last hits on the CS that are right in front of your eyes. If there's no CS in front of you, you'll be using that tempo somewhere else. You're not just going to be AFK in the fountain, right? You'll use your turn top, or bot, or Baron, or Dragon. As long as you don't miss the last hits when you're in lane... CS per minute is unnecessary.

""But you get a lot..."" That's because I'm good at getting it. The CS that's in front of my eyes. When you look at people pushing side lanes, there are those who just use skills and push the wave without getting the last hits. They use skills, but don't last hit. If you don't last hit, you don't get gold. You have to be someone who gets the last hit. When you guys have CS leakage, you think, ""I did well in lane, why is my CS so low?"" It's because you're missing it in the side lanes. Usually.

No, I'm not angry. We're having a passionate debate. Everyone, if I get genuinely angry while talking about LoL, you won't be able to handle it. You'll probably quit LoL. If you discuss LoL with me and I get angry, you'll think, ""LoL is too hard and what Chovy said about it is bull****,"" and you'll quit.

On that note, I'm going to the bathroom.

1llmw6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1llmw6s/do_keto_acv_gummies_actually_help_with_weight/,Do keto ACV gummies actually help with weight loss or is it all hype?,"I kept seeing ads and posts about **keto ACV gummies** and finally gave in. I wasn’t expecting a miracle, just something that could maybe help control my cravings or support weight loss without turning my life upside down. For reference, I’m in my mid-30s, work a desk job, and haven’t been consistent with working out or dieting.

After trying a few other weight loss trends that didn’t really go anywhere, I figured I’d give this one month. Here’s what really happened, no filters, no sales talk.

**what drew me in**

First off, I’m not on a strict keto diet. That’s important. But these **ACV keto gummies** are designed for people who aren’t hardcore keto but want the benefits of ketosis without fully giving up carbs. They’re packed with BHB (beta-hydroxybutyrate), which is supposed to help your body start using fat for energy instead of carbs. That’s the science behind **how does keto gummies work**, at least in theory.

Also, I’ve had a rocky relationship with apple cider vinegar in the past. I tried drinking it, but the taste was awful and it upset my stomach. So the idea of getting those benefits in a gummy format sounded way easier.

**first week: subtle shifts, not dramatic ones**

Right away, I didn’t notice anything major in terms of weight loss. No “5 pounds gone overnight” like some **keto gummies reviews** mention. But I did feel fuller between meals, which helped cut back on grazing. Usually, I snack late at night - crackers, chips, anything crunchy. That week, I barely reached for anything.

My energy during the day was a bit more stable. I didn’t need my second or third cup of coffee like usual. That part surprised me.

**week 2-3: small changes that added up**

The second week, I was down just under 3 pounds. Not huge, but I wasn’t trying that hard either. I wasn’t hitting the gym or counting calories. Just eating a little cleaner and being mindful of portions. I think the gummies helped curb my appetite, which made that easier.

The bloating went way down. My jeans felt less snug by the end of week three, and my stomach didn’t feel heavy or uncomfortable like it usually does after big meals.

If you’re curious, this is the kind I used: [**Keto ACV Gummies info here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2L8QR5SR/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)

**by week 4: worth it? kind of depends**

I ended the month at just over 6 pounds down. More importantly, I felt better. I was waking up with more energy, staying full longer, and not crashing by 3 p.m.

So if you’re wondering **does keto gummies work for weight loss**, I’d say they can help, but they won’t carry the whole load for you. You’ll still need to make some smart food choices and be a little active. But I didn’t do anything extreme, and still saw changes.

**side effects? none for me**

One thing I made sure to look up before starting was potential **keto gummies side effect** issues. I didn’t have any. No headaches, no stomach trouble, no weird aftertaste. I also appreciated that the **keto gummies ingredients** were pretty clean - BHB, apple cider vinegar powder, pectin instead of gelatin, and natural flavoring.

I’ve read that some people can get mild fatigue or dehydration with BHB if they don’t hydrate enough, so I just made sure to drink a lot of water.

**are these the best keto gummies? who knows**

There are a ton of brands now, and not all are created equal. Some people mentioned getting **keto gummies cvs** and having mixed results. I stuck to the kind I found online with decent feedback and a full ingredient list.

This is the exact one I used: [**Check it out here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2L8QR5SR/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)

**final verdict**

If you’re expecting magic, you’ll probably be disappointed. But if you’re looking for a tool to support better habits - cutting cravings, more stable energy, less bloating  - I think **ACV keto gummies** are worth a shot.

Just don’t fall for overhyped claims. Weight loss takes more than one thing. But these did make it easier to stick to a routine and feel more in control of my eating.

Curious to hear if anyone else has tried them. Did you notice real changes, or was it a flop? Let’s compare notes.",1,1751005657.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

I felt soo soo safe and secure around him and tbh thats something that was always in my mind that I have to feel absolutely secured around my partner and I did, I felt my best. Love was always in the small things, he did things without even me asking whether it was giving me coffee first thing in the morning lecture because he knew I woke up late and didnt get time to get my coffee and ran straight to attend my class or asking me of everything and making sure I am never sad and if I am he made sure to sit and resolve. So in short everything was going well then we started our jobs we were talking still but slowly slowly we stopped talking and then one day we fought, I thought I got disrespected and broke up, blocked them and they started to contact me a lot but I blocked them everywhere and then it started hurting a little less each day and now we dont talk at all and I kinda hate them.  
I know that disrespect was just like a catalyst and the split would have happened otherwise as well but I dont know how can two people soo much in love can just split and the reason of separation be distance. How is it even possible and is it actually DISTANCE or some underlying other thing. I dont know and we'd  still say DISTANCE MADE US APART.",1,1751005639.0,love,1,1.0,False

1llmu90,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1llmu90/vent_visited_extended_family/,Vent (visited extended family),"This vacation we among other things visited my wive's sister and stayed with her family for a few days. They have become increasingly interested in better coffee over the years, but… yeah…

In the beginning when we visited (about 10 years ago) they were always serving coffee made on grocery store bought beans (you know the kind), ground to a fine dust on a knife equipped grinder. It was undrinkable, always. They did enjoy it though, so I simply just drank less coffee each time we visited.

To make the situation a bit better, we gave them a Wilfa Black as a Christmas gift one year. They loved it, thankfully, and we ended up getting slightly better coffee. Then I started to buy locally roasted beans from around their area, and they noticed a clear difference. This is when their interest was a bit sparked.

The husband later took a coffee brewing course of some kind, and then started to get introduced to pourover brewing instead of their regular batch brews. Things were good! Always good beans on their shelf! Always using a V60. This has actually lasted until today.

But. Each time I visit I notice how the Wilfa grinder is always pushed to finest setting – dust. I silently push it towards the middle, but somehow each morning it is always back at the finest setting.

Asked about it this time, and the husband says he prefer it this way. So does the wife. Also they always pour all their beans into the hopper to sit there for days on end. ""The manual says 10 seconds running the grinder is enough coffee for two people"" they correct me when I am starting to measure the beans up.

This is mind boggling for me, especially as they enjoy good beans, and did the coffee course etc. 

To keep things civil, we have simply silently agree we do our own cups of coffee, with whatever settings each one prefers. Thankfully the beans on the shelf are still usually good.

Have never felt pearls to swine has been better fitting than here. They are lovely people thankfully, so all can be forgiven.",1,1751005452.0,pourover,0,0.67,False

1llmtty,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1llmtty/utah_purity_culture/,Utah purity culture🚩,"My wife and I were at dinner the other night talking about church and politics and stuff. I was trying to make the point to her that the Church teaches you from a young age not to trust your own eyes or instincts, but to just trust them. The leaders and revelations. 

One of the clearest points to me that the church is false and just man made 🚩is the perfection culture. I think we’ve seen what that obsession with perfection actually leads to. On one hand I do think it’s a good thing that everyone is constantly striving (such a Mormon word) to be the “best” version of themselves. Whatever “best” means to them. However, in the few years that I lived there, I think I know why it leads the nation in antidepressants prescribed per capita, porn viewership, cosmetic enhancements, and I think at one point suicide rates. 

Why? 

Utah is a state where over 60% of the population belongs to the same church that claims to be the key to happiness. If the gospel is working, why is everyone so fucking depressed?

People always say, “Without the Church, I don’t know where I’d be.” But what if the answer is… not depressed? Not addicted to porn? Not dropping thousands on Botox and chin implants just to look like Saw? I mean the Church literally had to release sleeveless garments to keep up with the pressure. 

Everyone in Utah is fake. 
I remember hearing about a bishop’s wife in Utah County who would drive over an hour and a half to get her filler and botox, just so no one in her town would find out. Then she’d turn around on Sunday and teach a young women’s lesson on self worth. 


Then you have a bunch of men addicted to porn who probably started watching it in middle school, maybe stopped during their mission, got married thinking marriage would solve it, and ended up right back on it. When I looked it up the stats, not only did it say leads nation in porn viewership but that it leads the nation in porn subscriptions. Why are so many people purchasing porn in Utah?

I don’t understand the suicide one. I hope to never get to that point in my life. It’s incredibly sad to me. Why is the leading cause of death in Utah suicide?

Curious to hear all of your thoughts 

Anyway, bringing it back to my original point. The church culture makes it look like everything is great and happy. But the statistics say otherwise. Don’t be fooled just because a Mormon family appears happy, rich, good looking, etc. 9/10 the mom and daughter got into a screaming match over modesty and then went to swig to make up. It creates emotional damage, clearly causes mental illness and triggers impulsive behaviors. 
People simply don’t know who they are.



ALSO. Here is a poem ChatGPT created for me with a message. Hope you like it 🤣

“The Land of Lip Filler and Lies”

In the land where the prophets all dwell,
Lives a beauty standard straight outta hell.
Where modesty’s preached from the chapel stage,
But fillers and Botox are all the rage.

The temple’s pure, the heart is clean,
But don’t you dare look “less than” nineteen.
A wrinkle? A flaw? A natural face?
Girl, you better book that med spa place.

It’s lashes, extensions, a jawline sharp,
A chin so fake it could play the harp.
Brows laminated, lips like trout,
“Self-worth” is preached, but it’s all clout.

It’s Relief Society meets Real Housewives,
Trading bake sales for BBL vibes.
You fast, you pray, you kneel in grace—
Then head to Draper to freeze your face.

Then there’s the guy who marries at twenty-three,
Realizes quick that sex ain’t always free.
He’s back online by month six or seven,
With garments around his ankles and guilt level eleven.

Elders court girls like real gentlemen,
As long as she’s hot and a solid ten.
Scriptures by day, thirst traps by night,
Don’t drink coffee — but FaceTune’s alright.

They’ll judge your soul for a single tattoo,
While injecting their face till it barely moves.
Call it “gospel-centered,” call it “divine,”
But everything’s filtered, surgically aligned.

Fake smile, fake hair, fake tits, fake grace,
Still begging for likes to feel seen in this place.
You don’t need repentance, a hug, or a man —
You need to admit it was never God’s plan.

1llmtkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Banff/comments/1llmtkr/honest_experience_at_the_fairmont_springs_hotel/,Honest experience at the fairmont springs hotel in Banff,"So. Keep in mind that I was doing quite a bit of research on people’s experiences at this hotel in Banff so maybe my expectations were probably a bit too high. 

My husband and I drove up to Banff from bc and the drive was a 10/10. Absolutely stunning and worth the long drive! Banff in itself is beautiful, the scenery is unlike anywhere we’ve been. 

The hotel is beautiful although the rooms are very small and pricey but the size is understandable considering the building was built in 1888. We were however extremely disappointed in the service at the hotel. We don’t expect the same service we get in Europe because you’re just not really going to get that in North America, especially not Canada but the service at this specific hotel was absolutely atrocious. The food was extremely disappointing but that did put me in an accidental harsh diet (gotta take the Ws where I can I guess). Just to mention off the top of my head, the high tea is a solid 1/10.. the tea was actually very good BUT we had one bite of two finger sandwich before deciding to get the check and finding food in the village… (the foood at the village was very good, went to Lupo), room service was just not good, my veggies were dirty, old and not cut properly lol, and there was a piece of plastic in my sandwich, and getting absolute watered down coffee was a bonus. I am assuming that people who work here possibly don’t need any hotel/service industry experience? Maybe that’s why or maybe we are just snobs ? 

Anywho just wanted to give an honest personal experience ! Still would come back just because the view is that breath taking  and at this point the service at the hotel is comical ! ",2,1751005378.0,Banff,6,0.75,False

# 📅 WHAT’S HAPPENING THIS WEEK?

🎬 - **Adventure Cinema – Outdoor Movies That’ll Make You Forget Netflix Exists**  
📍 - [Kedleston Hall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5d3MGns8mezziGWQA)

🎟️ - Tickets Required  
📷 - [u/adventurecinemauk](https://www.instagram.com/adventurecinema) [u/ntkedlestonhall](http://instagram.com/ntkedlestonhall)

Kedleston Hall’s turning into Derby’s fanciest field trip, but with ABBA, snacks and a massive screen. Belt out *The Greatest Showman*, scream *Mamma Mia!* lyrics like you’re on a Greek island, or plonk the kids down for *The Gruffalo* while you neck a slushie. Pack a picnic, bring a blanket, and prepare to cry at *Pretty Woman* like it’s 1990. Five films, zero sofas, 10/10 chance of dancing in a field.

Derby’s taco game just got spicy. Mucho Picante has landed in the Food Court with a menu that reads like a love letter to Mexican street food. We’re talking birria tacos dripping in consomé, loaded nachos, jalapeño poppers, and even birria pizza. Fancy a lamb burger or a fried fish taco? They’ve got that too. Throw in churro-style desserts and a horchata to wash it down, and you’re laughing.

The Digital Nomad Revolution: Why Now?

Picture this: the world’s cubicles are emptying. Laptops are multiplying in coffee shops, hammocks, and hostel lounges. The digital nomad revolution isn’t coming—it’s here. Borders blur, routines shatter, and the old career ladder? Torched. Welcome to the era where work is wherever Wi-Fi flows and ambition refuses to sit still.

Why now? Because technology finally caught up with wanderlust. Because the pandemic shattered illusions of “office necessity.” Because you’re done trading your hours for someone else’s dream.

The Anatomy of a Digital Nomad Job

Freedom vs. Security: The Eternal Tug-of-War

Every digital nomad job is a balancing act. Freedom on one side. Security on the other. The best gigs let you call the shots—where, when, and how you work. But don’t get it twisted: freedom isn’t free. You trade the illusion of “job security” for the real thing—self-reliance.

Skills That Print Money Anywhere

Forget degrees. The currency here is skills. Portable, in-demand, adaptable. If you can solve problems, create value, and communicate across cultures, you’re already ahead of the herd.

Remote Tech Titans

Software Development: The Code Conquerors

Developers are the rockstars of the remote world. Code is the passport. Build apps in Bali, debug in Berlin. Demand? Insatiable. Pay? Often obscene. If you speak Python, JavaScript, or Ruby, you’re golden.

UX/UI Design: Crafting Digital Realms

Designers sculpt the internet’s first impressions. If you can make users swoon with seamless interfaces, you’ll never be out of work—or out of places to work from.

Cybersecurity: The Invisible Shield

Hackers don’t sleep. Neither do cybersecurity pros. Protecting digital assets is a global game, and you’re the goalie. High stakes, high pay, high adrenaline.

Creative Mavericks

Copywriting: Words That Sell in Every Time Zone

Copywriters are the secret agents of persuasion. Sales pages, emails, ads—if you can turn phrases into profit, you can work from anywhere. The only limit? Your imagination and Wi-Fi signal.

Graphic Design: Pixels with Passport Stamps

Design is the universal language of cool. If you can wield Photoshop or Illustrator, your office is wherever inspiration strikes. Clients care about your portfolio, not your postal code.

Video Editing: Storytelling on the Move

Video is king. Editors are the kingmakers. If you can splice, dice, and animate, you’re in demand. Bonus: your backdrop can be a beach, a mountain, or a bustling city square.

The Knowledge Brokers

Online Tutoring: Teaching from Tulum to Tokyo

Got knowledge? Sell it. Online tutors teach languages, math, music—anything. Platforms connect you to students worldwide. No commute, no classroom, just pure impact.

Coaching & Consulting: Wisdom for Hire

If you’ve got expertise, package it. Life coaches, business consultants, productivity gurus—people pay for shortcuts. Your Zoom room is your boardroom.

E-commerce Architects

Dropshipping: Selling Without Borders

No inventory, no warehouse, no problem. Dropshipping lets you sell products worldwide. Your job? Spot trends, build stores, market like mad.

Print on Demand: Art Meets Algorithm

Artists and designers, rejoice. Print on demand lets you sell custom designs on shirts, mugs, and more—without touching a single box.

Amazon FBA: The Global Marketplace Hustle

Amazon FBA is retail on autopilot. Source products, ship to Amazon, let them handle the rest. You focus on scaling, not shipping.

The Content Syndicate

Blogging: Building Empires with Words

Bloggers build brands, attract eyeballs, and monetize with ads, affiliates, and products. It’s slow-burn, but the payoff can be massive.

YouTube: Vlogging Across Continents

YouTube is the new TV. Vloggers document adventures, review gear, teach skills. Monetize with ads, sponsors, merch. Your life is your content.

Podcasting: Broadcasting from Beach Cafés

Podcasts are exploding. If you can talk, you can build an audience. Interview, educate, entertain—then monetize through sponsorships and products.

Social Media Alchemists

Social Media Management: Orchestrating Online Fame

Businesses need voices online. Social media managers craft posts, engage followers, and build brands. If you live on Instagram, cash in.

Influencer Marketing: Monetizing the Self

Influencers turn attention into income. Build a niche, grow your tribe, partner with brands. Authenticity is your currency.

Community Management: Herding Digital Cats

Communities are the new kingdoms. Manage groups, moderate forums, nurture engagement. You’re the glue that holds digital tribes together.

The Data Whisperers

Data Analysis: Decoding the World Remotely

Data analysts turn chaos into clarity. Companies crave insights, not just numbers. If you can wrangle spreadsheets and visualize trends, you’re indispensable.

Virtual Assistance: The Swiss Army Knife of Nomads

VAs do it all—email, research, scheduling. You’re the backbone of busy entrepreneurs. Adaptability is your superpower.

Project Management: Leading Teams from Hammocks

Remote teams need leaders. Project managers keep chaos at bay, deadlines in check, and teams aligned. If you can herd cats, you can manage projects.

The Outliers

Translation: Bridging Worlds, Word by Word

Speak multiple languages? Translation is your ticket. Businesses need to go global, and you’re the bridge.

Transcription: Turning Audio into Assets

Transcribers turn podcasts, interviews, and videos into text. It’s detail work, but it pays—and you can do it from anywhere.

Stock Photography: Selling Snapshots of the Journey

Photographers, your travel shots are assets. Stock sites pay for unique, high-quality images. Every sunset could be a sale.

The Realities: Perks and Pitfalls

The Freedom Tax: Unseen Costs of Mobility

Freedom is intoxicating. But there’s a price—unstable income, time zone headaches, flaky clients. The cost of liberty is unpredictability.

Loneliness and the Community Hack

Nomad life can get lonely. The fix? Coworking spaces, meetups, online communities. Find your tribe, wherever you roam.

Future-Proofing: Skills That Survive the Next Wave

Automation is coming for the routine. Future-proof yourself with creativity, critical thinking, and adaptability. The robots can’t touch that—yet.

How to Choose Your Nomad Path

Self-Assessment: Your Skills, Your Market

Inventory your skills. What do people pay for? Where do you shine? The sweet spot is where your talents meet market demand.

The Experimentation Mindset

Try, fail, pivot, repeat. The best nomads experiment relentlessly. Don’t marry your first gig—date around.

Building Your Nomad Brand

Portfolio Power Moves

That’s how FIRE feels sometimes. There’s this fixation on saving more, spending less, optimizing everything. It’s not about financial health anymore—it’s about control.

I’ve seen people beat themselves up for buying coffee, visiting family, or taking a weekend trip. Like… what’s the point of all this if you’re constantly guilt-tripping yourself?

Money’s a tool. Not a moral compass. I’m trying to unlearn that shame.

Anyone else notice this mindset?

It's now been removed, she had brain surgery this week. She's recovering well, she has some temporary paralysis but that should fade. But being a PIMO thru this is all is so fricking difficult. My mom is talking about how Jehovah pulled her thru, how she's going to start studying even more, my dad knows my doubts so he's pressing me. And the hypocrisy I'm seeing from elders is palpable. We're in different halls and their hall has offered a lot of support; I got two elders asking me for coffee cause I hadn't been in person to the meeting since the news. (I also got sick in the meantime lol.) I'm like do I go inactive and be the pity case?? I dunno it's just so much. I've been thru highs, lows, suicidality the past few weeks. It's a lot.",7,1751005127.0,exjw,1,1.0,False

I was sleeping when he suddenly wake me up and asked me where the emergency money was hidden after giving him the envelope  I asked why and he answered he needed to give it to the spiritual GuRu! Because he was a great humanitarian. I was fucking baffled even after my continous advice he gave these people $7000 out of our $15000 emergency fund while sitting on the floor while they were on our sofas. Furthermore these people invited me to touch their feet so they can give their blessings too. After these people left I asked my father why the Fu** did he invited them in and gave them our money and he got mad at me. I argued these people were driving Mercedes they didn't need the money in response he yelled at me and left the house, he came back after hours and isn't talking to Me.

1llmqsb,https://i.redd.it/gzl51kuzwe9f1.jpeg,AIO I want to return a “gift” from my dad,"My dad and I share a lot of personality traits, so we can bicker pretty often. While he and my brother had flown out to help me build a deck at our home, this was all mostly fine until after my brother left, while my dad stayed, relocating himself from a hotel to our extra bedroom where my brother had been sleeping.

Besides continuously fighting to try to get my dad to respect our basic house rules (no shoes in the house; whisper near the baby room when the baby is asleep; no continuous phone use or screens near the baby - basic stuff), he started doing things that I found unacceptable, even when I would ask him not to.

Examples: throwing our hardwood decking boards onto the gravel after I asked him not to; throwing our belongings away, even after asking him to ask us first.

After convincing my wife (34W) and me that we should plant a tree in our front yard, I awoke the next morning to the skid steer I had rented being driven to the front yard. 

This was a (normal) work day for me, so I really could not do much work outside. I was already upset that he was using the machine without talking to me at all; had started digging a hole in our front yard without talking to my wife and me; and stressed bc I had a lot of work to do and operating that machine isn’t really something my dad should be doing anyway. When I went outside, I asked my dad to please not do too much, and not to tear up the grass (which a skid steer is wont to do).

After coming back from the coffee shop, I asked him to please stop digging. He didn’t want to stop. I got angry and said he should listen to what I am trying to tell him about our (my wife’s and my) own yard. He continued digging for the next 5 hours.

Eventually, he convinced my wife (34W) and my mother-in-law to go out with my daughter (13 months), to a tree farm an hour away. It was 101 degrees outside, so it was a long day to find a tree. He kept insisting it was a gift, so we went along with it and tried to make the day fun.

After we found a tree, we went to get lunch. My dad (67M), had 3 drinks and was obviously tipsy. No one else drank alcohol. We (wife, MIL, myself) were all mostly focused on the baby, who is tough to keep entertained, clean, and safe, while out and about.

When we got home, my dad made it clear that he did not want to pay the tree farm people to plant the 2,000-pound tree he got “on sale.” He wanted me to “figure out” how to plant it.

I just want to return the thing, rather than renting expensive equipment, paying people, and working myself harder than I already do, to plant this tree.

What should I do? AITA for not appreciating this gift?",1,1751005079.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False
