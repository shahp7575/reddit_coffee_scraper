Because its just me, I'm using their single basket which is approx. 13g of coffee. long story short, I've gone through about 1 kg of beans and still cant get this MOFO dialed in. Its absolutely doing my head in.

Right now I have the 1 cup set for 20 seconds (yes 20 seconds!), the grind set at 25, pre-infuse at 60/8. These are the ONLY settings i can remotely get a 30ml shot. Its the closest I can get for a 13g in for 26g-30g out. The coffee starts to come through at the 5 second mark of the pre-infuse. You can tell its not quite right because its very black for about the next 5 seconds until its gets that golden type color. Flow is ok though. This produces a 30ml shot.

Ideally I would have liked a 27 second/volume to achieve a 30ml shot. However no grind setting can make this happen....none! The very last test I did was a 25 second shot/volume with a grind level of 8 and the puck simply fell out of the portafilter when i tipped it upside down. Even a grind level of 12 still produced a 55 ml shot over with a 25 second /volume.

I Don't need an education on beans. I know my roaster and my beans.

Does anyone have any experience with the Breville Orcale using a single basket (13g) and ideal settings.

A 20 second shot inclusive of an 8 second pre-fuse seems just plain wrong. But right now that's the only way i can produce a 30ml shot

PS my physical grinder level (at the top grinder) is set at 3. I'm not sure what it ships out at from the factory. I've clearly changed it at some point I cant remember.

This was a fairly new 3-cup Bialetti Moka Pot which I'd started loving. I got some really nice espresso like shots, made some brilliant iced coffees, and other things. Now I am sad because it has been rendered completely useless. 

Now the replacement funnel is pretty expensive at INR \~1,700 or so. Should I just get it or is there an alternate out there that I could opt for? Or some jugaad?

I’m in a challenging situation with my boyfriend of five years, and I could really use some perspective. Recently, we’ve been facing a tough time due to issues related to infertility, which has led to increased tension and arguments between us.

A little background: earlier this year, we travel to his home country, and I found out he met up with his ex-girlfriend for coffee, despite telling him prior my discomfort with it. At the time, I was also feeling lost in the relationship and needed a break to think if I wanted to continue or not. He told me this when we were in a car to visit his friends, he begged me to join him and not let him go alone to his friend’s house, which I reluctantly agreed to, but I cried throughout the journey. However, next day, we returned to our normal lives without fully addressing our issues. Once we return home we decided to reset, create better habits and work on us, he was unemployed at the time and I try to help him, not 100% financially but close, and also looking at jobs for him, etc... and for 6 months we were better than before, he stopped drinking had more energy, i stop complaining so much, tried to read more about how to control better my emotions and things seem very good! Also, important to say, he is in a foreign country, I helped him a lot with settling in because we met when he arrived here. However, summer return, he got a job, and what was going out for drinks 2x a week, transformed into going out for drinks every day, more fights and more complaints + infertility I was also on a lot of medication which did not help. 

We’ve had several fights over the years, he drinks a lot, and i complain a lot, I had this trait that I'm working on it but sometimes i try to have a conversation and the person doesn't want to have the talk or goes to other room not to listen, and i get furious. He often struggles with communication, especially with his ADHD, and I feel like I’ve been the one doing most of the emotional heavy lifting and feel a lot of our fights happen, and then they go under the mat and then dont get resolved. 

  
We had a major fight last week... small things piled up, I was in a lot of stress and I said things that I did not want it and push the argument, he stood up and said that he was done, and he wanted to break up, i completely shut down and start crying and said that that is not what i wanted, he said that he stopped feeling attracted by me because of my weight gain when he met me I was skinny, he didnt saw this going anywhere, he feels i only seem him as a good father and thats it. 

In part is true I stop carrying about how i look in the last year, it was a lot of things going on, like infertility, my job got to intense, him being unemployed, etc... I was in a lot of stress in the past year that contributed to this and in part it was good that he told me because I feel that is something that requires some work. 

Next day, he asked for a break to reflect on whether he wants to continue the relationship. He will stay with a friend. We agreed to be in a relationship but be distant. Yesterday, we had a brief encounter at home where we spoke casually about mundane things, and he thanked me for washing his clothes. I asked if he wanted to go see a soccer game on Sunday, he mentioned going to his friend’s farm for the weekend and hasn’t confirmed if he’ll be able to be in town on time, which makes me anxious. I gave me a small cuddle in the arm, and he said, "" I need to go..."" and left. 

I’m trying to respect his space, but the emotional distance is concerning. I’m left wondering if he’s leaning toward a breakup or if he genuinely just needs some time to decompress i also feel that i was there for him on all his less good moments like unemployment and changing countries, and because im having a difficult time with fertility and a bit more emotional lately, he wants to break up, once we were doing the reset things were better, the fertility treatments and the drinking came to ruin things. I’ve thought about reaching out for a heart-to-heart conversation when he’s ready, but I’m unsure how to approach it without pushing him further away.

Has anyone been through something similar? How did you navigate the uncertainty and emotional distance? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1,1729065765.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I have seen strong feelings expressed against this, but it seems there a people interested in this option, particularly people who are used to doing manual pour over.

What’s next?,"I [25M] have been dating my girlfriend [24F] for five years and we’ve been living together for two years. We met in college and I always felt like she was the perfect person to come into my life at the perfect time. I’ve always felt like we had a very trusting relationship, which I valued because of negative past experiences. 

Over the past few months I’ve been very busy and stressed with my office job. I can admit that while this has been going on I’ve been available less and haven’t been as warm and affectionate when we’ve spent time together because I’ve been feeling drained at the end of my workdays. I shouldn’t let this kind of thing get in the way of my relationship with her, and I haven’t been at my best. 

The problem is, she’s felt that, and in the meantime, she met this male coworker that she’s been spending more and more time with. It started off slow. She’d tell me she was going to hang out with a coworker or multiple coworkers after work, and we had a trusting relationship, so I thought nothing of it, given that I was stuck at work and couldn’t spend time with her anyway. Over time, she started to spend more and more time with her coworkers and I realized I didn’t really know who she was with and what she was doing while she was gone. I asked her about it multiple times and at first received non answers. I was getting so worried about what she was doing and with who that I talked to both her mom and sister and asked them what to do and if they could help me figure it out. Eventually she told me she’s been hanging out with one of her male coworkers, let’s call him Tim, and her and Tim just hang out at coffee shops, do things around the city, and sometimes watch movies at his place. She gave me some examples of things they’re done and I was really hurt because we have had a running list of places to go or things around our city that we’d been planning to try together for the first time, and she’d knocked things off our list with Tim instead of me. I confronted her about how hurtful that was and how I haven’t been the best boyfriend recently, but how I was starting to get a little suspicious of this Tim guy. I made her look me in the eyes and tell me that Tim is nothing more than a friend and she did so and also apologized for doing these things without me, basically telling me that there’s absolutely nothing between them and I have nothing to worry about. 

So after that, we went back to normal for a few weeks until last night. Last night she fell asleep early and so I went to plug her phone in and double check that her alarms were set for work in the morning. While I had her phone unlocked, a text popped up from Tim. I feel guilty for doing it still, but my curiosity got the best of me and I opened the text. I ended up reading through their texts from around the past month or so and I could feel my stomach sinking. It wasn’t consistently every day, but most days they were sending each other good morning and goodnight texts, they were sharing songs and making playlists together, he was flirting with her HARD, and while most of the time she seemed to shrug it off and say he’s a good friend and she appreciates him, sometimes she was openly flirting back. One set of texts that hurt me the most was from when she was out of town for a weekend around a month ago. I tried to check in with her regularly while she was gone on her trip, but could barely get any responses. In her texts with him, he was telling her he missed her and she was sending back that she missed him too and was giving him constant updates on what she was up to while she was away. 

After I’d read their texts, it was eating away at me so I woke her up to confront her. She didn’t deny that he’d been openly flirting with her and that she’d sometimes even flirted back. I brought up how she’d lied to my face about how he was a friend and nothing more, and she apologized and insisted that while yes emotionally he’s been a bit more than just a friend, there hasn’t ever been anything physical between them. She said that she’s known he was into her and has just been in denial about it, and when she had been ready to admit that to herself, she would’ve put a stop to it. She offered to cut him off immediately if that’s what I wanted, which she did the next morning. 

The problem is whats’s sticking with me still is the fact that I confronted her about it initially and she lied about it. She said there was nothing there when there was, and didn’t show any signs of putting a stop to it until I read her texts and confronted her about it. She cut him off and apologized but I don’t know how I can trust her going forward. At this point, I really do believe her when she says that there wasn’t anything physical, and I do believe her when she says she’s sorry. 

Basically I’m looking for advice on how to handle this situation from here. I still really love her, had had plans to propose to her, and want things to work. But on the other hand, I don’t know how I can trust her. Yes, I’ve been distant and haven’t been at my best in our relationship, but instead of talking to me about it, she went outside of our relationship to the first guy that was giving her attention and got what I was failing to provide from someone else. I’ve asked her to go stay with her parents for the next week or so so I can be alone, process the whole situation, and decide what to do.

TLDR: I’ve been stressed and haven’t been the best boyfriend, but instead of talking to me about it, my girlfriend went and got her emotional needs met outside of our relationship with a coworker. I only found out after reading her texts and I believe her apology is sincere, but don’t know how I can trust her going forward. I’m looking for advice on how to handle this situation

I like meeting new people from around the world, learning new things, having deep engaging conversations about the universe. Or dogs, dogs are cute too. 

I don't respond to empty accounts or new accounts just to avoid being ghosted. No I don't do OF I am looking for someone serious who actually enjoys a nice decent conversation.

I’ve been taking 10mg of Methylphenidate for two weeks now, and honestly, I don’t know if it’s working.

When I went to the doctor, my specific request was, “I want to feel the way I feel when I’m high.” That’s when I feel most productive—my mind is blank, and there’s only one thought in my head instead of a song playing on loop. I thought the medication would help me achieve that, but it’s not working.

Ever since I started these meds, my sleep has been completely messed up. I force myself to stay in bed for nine hours, but I wake up feeling unrested and unmotivated. I’ve had to start drinking coffee just to stay awake at work. How am I supposed to navigate life like this?

I have a song playing in my head 24/7—random lyrics, the entire song, just on repeat. I’m still wavering; I’m still overthinking everything. I can’t hold attention when someone is talking to me.

As I type this, I’m on the verge of a breakdown. I thought I finally found an answer to why I am the way I am.

When we newly started dating I told my boyfriend if he ever wants to cheat, he can do it so long as he tells me first. He asked me if I want an open relationship and I said no. I have no interest in cheating on him because sadly to my eyes, no one except him is sexually appealing. He laughed and said ok if he ever finds a girl so attractive that he wants to hook up with her, he’ll take my permission first(given that she also wants to hook up with him, consent always). It’s sort of become a game to us now. He’s calls his elusive imaginary woman his Angelina Jolie and my imaginary man is Brad Pitt. Whenever we see a really attractive person we look at each other and ask - permission milega? It’s always a no of course but it always makes us laugh. 


A few weeks ago bf went abroad for a week for a work thing. We’d VC every night and I can confirm he didn’t hook up with any one. He kept wishing I was with him and promised we’d go together again. When I went to his place when he came back, his place was decked in fairy lights and candles, he’d drawn an amazing bubble bath with our favorite bath salts and ordered our favorite take out. It was so romantic and beautiful. Later in bed I asked him why he didn’t sleep with anyone on his trip?(he’s pretty easy on the eyes and man’s got game for days, I’ve seen women hit on him when I’m right next to him). I’d given him permission to have fun on the trip. And he said “I don’t want to sleep with anyone except you. Sadly, you’re the only one I’m attracted to.” 

We started laughing but then he got serious. He said he knows the only reason I give permission to my boyfriends to fuck around is because I’m scared they’ll do it behind my back anyways. And he’s never going to do that. I started crying and he held me close and I can’t explain it my heart was so full and light at the same time. 

Yeah, yours truly has been burned multiple times before but I think I’ve found my one guys. He’s so sweet and honest and wonderful and kind. He’s disciplined and methodical and I’m completely chaotic. But when we’re together it just works. He gets my sense of humor and we find fun in the same things. His hobbies are so completely different from mine but still the same! I do the NYT crossword with my morning coffee and he plays chess before sleeping. We both listen to stoicism videos every morning. We’re both right leaning. I put together his outfits for work and he actually gives me constructive feedback on my outfits when we go out on dates. Aaaahhhh I’m equal parts scared and excited cuz the magnitude of emotions is almost too much bear. Gods it has to be criminal making someone feel this way!",0,1729063061.0,indiasocial,3,0.2,False
1g4tmlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1g4tmlq/severe_erosive_gastritis_intestinal_metaplasia/,Severe Erosive Gastritis - Intestinal Metaplasia - Healing Story,"Hi all,

Just wanted to share my story with Gastritis and my current progress.

It begins at the end of last year, where I started noticing some mild symptoms, such as weird tingling sensations on my body, specific foods having a big impact on my stomach (mild pain and/or diarrhoea) and the most annoying of all which was nausea, lightheadedness and tiredness. 

At the beginning I didn't pay much attention as at the time I was working 12 hours a day, eating usually from outside, and having 1 year old baby waiting at home to deplead any energy I had left :). I was also working out several times a week to keep up with my not so good diet. So at the time I though everything was related to me overworking myself.

As symptoms got worse, I started seeing a bunch of doctors: cardiologist, pulmonologist (as I was also a smoker at the time), and finally a gastroenterologist.

First two doctors said everything was ok, the gastro did an endoscopy which showed severe erosive gastritis and server intestinal metaplasia. There was no H Pylori evidence, and after asking me a few questions he was relatively sure that my bad lifestyle as well as my constant stress (started a new company, got a housing loan and started a family, in the span of 18 months), where the culprits for getting this condition.  He put me on PPI for a couple of months and told me to watch a bit what I ate. He specifically said to try to limit fried stuff, coffee and smoking.

At the beginning I didnt think much of gastritis, especially since in my eyes the gastro downplayed it to just watching what I eat for a few weeks. It was after I start researching for myself that i understood is not that simple, and after I found out what metaplasia actually is, which kind of freaked me out. As I continued reading about it, especially in this subreddit I understood that I had to do much more to heal. Mind you that by this point, all the weird Gastritis symptoms we get, that sometimes have nothing to do with the stomach itself , also gave me a very bad health anxiety.

After a month's time and seeing several other doctors for my many symptoms, I decided to see a psychologist as well to help me manage my stress. Best decision I ever made. It took several visits (still ongoing to this day), but once my stress was under control, I was able to focus on the important stuff, which was nutrition and exercise. 

I found the gastritis healing book, which was a game changer. I followed that diet and recipes for 3 months, while also being on the PPI. Regarding exercise, I was never the guy to start running for 10km, so I used my dog walking time to do some cardio and then I took up paying sports, mostly tennis and soccer. I also bought a bike and went on semi-long cycling trips on the early hours of each weekend.

I also completely stopped smoking, coffee and would only drink alcohol (watered Gin) on very rare occasions (maybe 3-4 times during the my healing journey).

Apart from the PPI and diet, other food and supplements I took during that time:

1. Chamomile Tea with Manuka honey and ginger every morning. I live in a hot country so I had it with a few ice-cubes, room temp.

2. Mastich capsules.

3. Slippery elm capsules

4. Vitamins D3 and B12. D3 is because of a deficiency I have which can cause symptoms that could mess up my health anxiety. B12 because gastritis makes it difficult for us to absorb it.

5. Magnesium every night before bed. 

6. For the last month or so I 've been also taking L Glutamine in a powder form.

7. Ginger in all shapes and forms to handle my nausea, which was my biggest and most annoying symptom.

I dont know if any of the above specifically helped more than the other, but I think the combination of these supplements helped at least a bit.

  
Coming to now and a few weeks ago, I started noticing that my nausea was a lot better, I started eating more foods (again being very careful about the ingredients and h level), but incorporated new things in my diet slowly.

Yesterday I had my followup endoscopy.  The gastro said that my stomach is 95% normal now. The results are that the gastritis is now very mild (Dr is expecting to go away in a few weeks with another course of PPI and a bit of diet), and most importantly the Intestinal Metaplasia -> GONE. 

That last part made me all giddy, since whether or not it can be reversed is actually very controversial. Well, in my case it can and it did.

So if I can offer any sort of advice or insights from my bout with Gastritis, these are:

1. Find a Dr you can trust and is willing to discuss with you.

2. Stop reading random stuff on the Internet. The best possible source for information on Gastritis, is this subreddit. But even here, you need to be careful on the information you absorb, since everyone is battling this condition under different circumstances (age, diet, other conditions etc). Try to draw from examples that are most similar to your situation.

3. Learn to manage stress and anxiety. Gastritis can create a lot of that, and if its not controlled it can reverse any sort of progress you achieved.

4. Stress and anxiety is 50% the other 50% is your diet. Get the gastritis healing book. Even if you will not follow it to the letter, and it has a lot of insight on how our body is affected by specific foods, and what kind of foods you should be looking into to help you heal.

5. If you smoke, stop immediately. Believe or not, one of the good things that came out of this for me, is that it has made me stopped smoking. Feeling much better all around because of it.

6. Wine, coffee, beer, sodas and any other acidic beverages, say goodbye for a few months, it will be a big help. I drank only water and chamomile for 6 months

  
Finally, I just wanted to say that this can be healed. Maybe its not that easy as you may initially think, but it can. Your body is designed to heal, you just have to help it. Make a commitment for 3 months and follow that to the letter, it will get better.

  
To everyone battling this, I hope you get something from everything I said above to help you in your journey to heal. Stay strong.

Are there current ADHD meds that might not increase blood pressure? I know nothing about newer meds since Adderall, but it would be amazing to get back on something!

1g4tcan,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Frosty_Incident666/comments/1g4tcan/oc_intervention_jyx/,[OC] Intervention [Jyx],"""And what is all this about then?"" Rakke asked the assembly consisting of his wife, his husband, Tythor and Süpö. To see Tythor and Süpö sitting at one table without trying to get under each others...skin...was quite uncommon.

""Well..."" Süpö sighed, ""...we want you to stop merc work"". The Jyx was blunt as usual. ""I've thought it through. You're getting older and you have a daughter. You wouldn't want her to share the same fate as you, I know. Yes, I did ask you to come long last time, but it was for a good cause. I wish I wouldn't have!"". 

This came as quite a shock to Rakke, who had been doing such work for a long time now. He was *good* at it. Every enemy he had come across came to understand that he was not a soldier of fortune but a soldier of frustrations and that these frustrations would be taken out on *them*. ""You want what now?"" Rakke inquired, his eyebrow raising and his arms crossing in front of his chest. 

""We want you to stop fighting"" Tay answered, his voice tired. ""Every time you go out there, we don't know if you're ever going to come back. That last time...the blast almost go you!""

""Almost! But it didn't!"" Rakke exclaimed.

""But it could've gotten you. Had it been just a few centimeters more..."" Roxxa said with a serious tone, ""I don't want you to die that way. For what? Some money? We've got more than enough here. The Theseus has always provided us, even though Hell's Retreat is self-sustaining nowadays. It wasn't always like that. Even if it was a pact born out of necessity. Medical supplies for a place to hide. Nowadays they don't *have* to hide. They come to us because *they like us*. They like *Hell's Retreat*. There's no more reason to go out there and risk your life!"". 

Rakke tightened his eyes in suspicion, staring at Tythor with an intense gaze: ""Did you put them up to this?"":

""I would never! Do you think I would, after all we've been through? Don't you remember Grim? Do you have any idea how long it took to get the showers working again? How absolutely disgusting it was? I never asked anything! Anything! from you for that. And I won't either. But I do share their concerns. You're *my* *friend*. I don't want my friend to rush into what will come for him eventually"" Tythor frantically explained, visibly distressed about the sheer implication. No, he would never go behind Rakkes back. ""You know what. You're coming with me. We're going somewhere. I can't do much at the moment anyways, with the Nation of United Terran States being split-tongues again..."". 

Not wanting to continue this conversation, Rakke decided to go with Tythor. 

""Stay safe out there"" Süpö muttered, barely audible, before asking Tay if they had anything to drink.

""That's not going to fill the void in you either, father"" Rakke whispered, unsure if the Jyx had heard his words. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

""So...where are we going"" Rakke eventually broke his pouting, holding Tythors divine cup, which the Rakhar had given him wordlessly with a nod - something the Rakhar had never done before, claiming he didn't want to ""wasn't sure what kind of perverted stuff the cup would fill with if Rakke ever drank from it"". Of course Tythor asked Rakke to pour some of whatever he was drinking out of the cup, just out of curiosity. A risk? Maybe. This time it turned out to be some sort of soft-drink, one Tythor had never tasted before. He'd have to ask about it once things calmed down. Crisis averted. 

""An old friend"" Tythor responded, only to carry on in silence. 

""You think I *want* to do this?"" Rakke eventually asked. 

""Honestly, I don't know"" Tythor answered, focusing on piloting the ship. Süpö had provided him with one of those the Jyx would use to sneak away from time to time, when it wanted to be undisturbed. It was a small vessel, with two beds, a kitchen and a bathroom. Very spartan, but not uncomfortable. At least it had cup-holders, which Tythor found most ingenious. He'd have to ask the Theseus crew to retrofit *The Man*, having spilled coffee more than once over his consoles. Eventually Tythor took a deep breath: ""I know you're *fucked*, you know? Like, up there? Not trying to be rude or anything. It's just a fact. A sad one at that. I know that you do what you do - and who you do - trying to distract yourself from what you've experienced. Now I have to confess to something I *did* put them up to. You'll see soon enough- "". Tythor got interrupted by a transmission. 

""This is the Service of Interstellar Security, working in the capacity of the Nation of United Terran States. You are on route towards restricted space. A cos-"". Tythor muted the transmission and prepared to answer.

""This is Rakhar Z'jhangla from the ship...G...Y....4...dash...7.....T...speaking. We're well aware of our course and the perils it passes through. Now I know you're only doing your jobs, but as per regulation 308/7 you cannot prohibit us from accessing this space. We are aware of the risks. Thank you for your duty!"". The other ship didn't respond for a while. Tythor plugged in a pair of headphones and held it to what Rakke assumed was his equivalent of an ear.

""A bureaucrat, eh? Never. Mind. Then. Godspeed to you then, *godspeed*!!"" the Terran ship responded. 

Tythor thanked the Terrans for their service once more and continued course. 

""What did they want?"" Rakke asked, somewhat suspicious. 

""Nothing of importance. Just a heads up about some gravitational anomaly is all. Probably has to do with that pulsar over there"" Tythor lied. He had asked Süpö to update the maps on the ship, at least the ones the co-pilot could see and made sure they were all wrong. Eventually the cat would be out of the bag once they came close enough. ""Anyways, that scientist you picked up. Interesting person, don't you think?"" he attempted to divert the conversation.

""I'm not sure she'll help at all. I don't even know why I am doing all of that to be honest. I didn't grow up like the others, with tales of this fabled race of helpful aliens!"" Rakke confessed. 

T: ""She's getting along quite well with Tay. Asked me to bring her a *standard Terran compliment* and all. I'm just glad she was smart enough *not* to hurt Tay when they met. You Terrans are dangerous when you feel scared. Had a customer once, you know. In the middle of some kind of operation I guess? Or a heist. I really don't know. When I showed up with the product, they'd almost bludgeon me to death, thinking I was somebody else. Only to stop at the very last chance. That pipe almost hit me right in the noggin!""

R: ""What do you mean *smart enough not to hurt him?""*

T: ""Ah. I forgot to tell you. How convenient. When he first came to her quarters on the ship, she was holding a table lamp. Was ready to bash his head in, I'd wager. Luckily your man there explained her situation to her beforehand. And then entered very carefully. She dropped that lamp. Shame. I was going to ask on the internal comms if I could have it. It was a nice lamp!""

R: ""So that's where it went? I was considering to take it for myself. Shame.""

T: ""Anyways, she's getting along with him. He's taken her around to see all the sights on FUSS, Terran planet. Maybe he should take her to the Jyxiton one as well. And the others. Considering her field of work, I'm sure she would be delighted! I'm surprised by how well she's holding up, all things considered. Even after he told her of your relationship with Essix. She thought he was a lunatic when he first tried to explain it to her!"".

R: ""I still don't get it. Why is Süpö so intent on bringing them back? Father never grew up with those stories either"". 

T: ""HA! Finally I know more than you. What do you know of the old Kap'tan? The one before that slime you call a father?""

R: ""Not that much, honestly. I only know where his favorite place to sit was one the fleet ship. Turns out it's the same place I watched a planet...die...""

T: ""Yeah that old man would've been *pissed* at what Süpö did. He would've been utterly devastated, probably he would've even felt betrayed by his crew considering they went through with it. Thing is, that Kap'tan valued all life. Avoided conflict wherever he could. They didn't *have* to hide you know? They could've just rained down hell upon the Terran Federation. Instead, they chose another way to destabilize it. Yeah...Essix really did a number on your father back then, the crew told me.""

R: ""Father never speaks of that"". 

T: ""I wouldn't either, if I were Süpö. Apparently the damn Jyx got the experience the last moments of every Grrkrk on the planet before it got...destroyed. Do you remember it's name? I sure as hell don't. I've been hearing that there aren't even any records of it existing. Doesn't make any sense! I'm sure it had to be in targeting computers and all that. But the moment it happened...nothing. Absolutely nothing. As if it was wiped from history itself. Most people nowadays even believe the Grrkrk never had a home world. Your people call it a Man-Del-A effect or something. Anyways, that's why your Jyx guardian angel dislikes Essix so much. Still hasn't forgiven our cosmic friend."".

R: ""It's a hard thing to forgive. You think Essix will ever do the same to me?""

T: ""Nah. Personally I think the people you got rid of were a scourge to the galaxy anyways. There was a correlation with the times you were working and a significant dip in pirate activity, you know?""

R: ""I did not. Hey are we by any chance going to Essix?""

T: ""Took you long enough to notice!""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In Essix space there is a small pergola. In said pergola, there sits a man who has done the same, every day, for a long time. While the initial arrangement was that his mind be wiped at the beginning of each new day, he quickly decided to change the arrangement to something more suitable, so that he may selectively decide what to forget and when to forget it. Currently, the man was drinking tea with a cosmic sentience and an old lady he had never met before. Essix informed him that soon guests would arrive, so he went to produce some pastries and fresh tea. 

E: ""Rakke! My dear child! My dear father! Come to visit me in my own home? Something is bothering you?""

The faintest smile hushed across his face. Something was indeed bothering him, but he could feel all the weight and the anger lifting the closer they got. 

E: ""Come to me. Cook is making some good food. Wanted to try a new recipe. He cooks everything with love you know? Love for the craft. I'm having some good company over here, too."".

R: ""Glad to hear it. It's nice to feel a familiar voice. Yes, yes, there's something that's bothering me. But you already know, don't you?""

E: ""You're surprisingly easy to read when you're not ... *lewd*. I know. But I cannot give you advice on this. But I know somebody who might be able to. They're here."".

Tythor and Rakke floated towards the pergola, with no space suit, yet felt no discomfort or the other unwanted side-effects of being in a vacuum without proper equipment. Eventually, Rakke could make out three distinct figures: Essix, a woman and a man he didn't know.

E: ""That is Cook. He's of the original crew, you know? Well a descendant, but still. I've taken a liking to him. He's been around here for a long time."".

R: ""Amazing that he isn't dead yet. He doesn't look a day over 25!""

E: ""That is my doing. We have an agreement. Cook isn't particularly interested in finding out what the realm beyond is like.""

R: ""So there is one?""

E: ""Who knows? I haven't died yet!""

R: ""I think you know more than you let on"".

E: ""Guilty, but I still won't tell you.""

R: ""Bully!""

Rakke floated ever closer to the pergola. 

R: ""M-mother?!""

Mrs. G: ""Son! How have you been? I've been having the most amazing time here. This Cook fellow makes the finest of foods. And I don't gain any weight! Here, try these! You look like you could use some!""

She pushed some cookie into his hand, two layers of dough with a layer of marmalade in between, covered with powdered sugar. Essix assured him they were quite good, and went well with the black tea they were currently consuming. An exquisite blend from long ago which Essix had stored away for special occasions. 

Mrs. G: ""So? What's troubling you?""

Rakke hesitated. What was his mother doing here? She was quite settled in last time he met her on-planet. 

Mrs. G: ""Oh...it's simple really. I got bored. You Kapt'an, the ballsy fellow, he told me of somebody whose got a similar problem. Told me *ya might want to get together and play board games or something*. Essix here is such a nice person!""

R: ""Uhm...ok. And whose this guy?""

C: ""Oh I'm sorry. I'm Cook. Used to be a cook on the first intergalactic tow truck. Met Essix here a long time ago. How long was it? I don't know! I don't want to either. My cosmic friend here has taken good care of me!""

R: ""How come I've never met you before?""

C: ""I rarely interact with the fleet-ship nowadays. I know you come by and all, but there's maybe three of four people on board I'd like to spend my time with. Not everybody is always talking to Essix when you visit, you know?""

R: ""You're telling me you've lived inside Essix for all that time and we've never met?""

C: ""That's correct."".

R: ""And you never once thought to announce yourself?""

C: ""Nope"". 

R: ""Do you even give a fuck at all?""

C: ""Refer to my previous answer. No need to be rude"".

Essix chuckled. 

R: "" ... Did you watch?""

C: ""Watch? It felt amazing!""

Rakke didn't know what to make of this information, but blushed none the less. 

Mrs. G: ""Now what's troubling you dear?"" 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Rakke explained the situation to her best her could, how he was unsure what to do. On the one hand he had enjoyed his work, and it brought him an outlet to vent his frustrations, but on the other he didn't want to keep his family and friends worried. His mother, Essix and Cook listened intensely. Cooks proposal was ""to light up some KRT and let bygones be bygones"", although this was met with disapproval from Rakkes mother. She listened, and listened, and listened. 

""Why...why don't you work with that Tythor fellow then?"" she asked, ""I like Tythor. He seems like a trustworthy individual and good friend to have"". 

Rakke explained the situation Tythor had gotten himself into to her. 

""That's no good"" she frowned, ""damn those in power, damn them all to hell. Nobody came to our aid, and still they asked for so much. And for what?""

""There's another solution"" Cook interjected, ""How about you, Rakke, make another company. Then you take over Tythors Terran assets, do everything by the book for a while until he can get back on his feet, and then dissolve the company and sell it all back to Tythor for a bargain? As for your ... *other needs*. How about working for the Space Hazard Acquisition Forces of Terra? They have some less dangerous jobs, I hear, but they are still quite demanding. It could be a way to quell your thrist for thrills?"". 

""That may be an idea..."" Rakke mumbled, ""by the way, what do you know of these Squishies? My Kapt'an is hell bent on bringing them back, but I don't know why."".

""Must be a good Kapt'an then"" Cook answered, telling their story and how they helped them in a time of need. He then gave Rakke a sample of his own blood, with specific instructions on how to store it. 

It was time to make their way back to FUSS. At a random non-Terran space station they decided to get some rest before continuing their journey. ""Blerch!"" Tythor made a grimace of disgust when trying the coffee they had on station, ""tastes disgusting"". A person some tables over turned around. 

""If it isn't my favorite lizard in the whole galaxy!"" the person sat down at their table. 

""Do I *know* you?"" Tythor asked, slightly confused. He had come to know a lot of people, so he'd try to disguise himself when he didn't want to be disturbed. Which was an even more sensible thing to do now, consideirng his predicament. 

""It was a long time ago. You've helped me with a *simple administrative task* at the Galactic Senate. I'd recognize you anywhere, no matter how well you try to hide yourself"" the Terran said, grinning, ""although I never did beat up that line-cutter with my belt. You still have the stamp I gave you?"".

""Give? I always just assumed you had forgotten it. But yes, I still have it. It's my good luck charm"" Tythor answered. Tythor noticed the Terran wasn't using a translation device, but spoke clearly and consistently, unlike the last time they had met. 

""So - how have you been? I was in quite a hurry last time, sorry for that"" the Terran inquired. Tythor then started to explain everything this Terrans act had led to. 

""So now I'm the proud owner of a company that provides quality goods at reasonable prices and also a fugitive in Terran space. I have to confess though, the only reason I helped you back then was because the one behind you in line - the line-cutter - was way more of a nuisance than you!"", he summarized. The Terran seemed bewildered, confused and thoroughly entertained, asking if it could hitch a ride to FUSS, wanting to ""check it out for themselves"".

1g4tb4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1g4tb4j/what_is_the_next_step/,What is the next step?,"Hello all.

I guess I’ve finally mustered up enough courage to write this as I’ve seen in previous posts that I could get some constructive advice and help from the Reddit community.

The current workplace that I’m “employed” at has made me go past my breaking point where I feel mentally shot and feel ashamed that I’m not only able to support the people around me, but myself.                                If it helps, I’m in the architecture field.

I don’t really know how to start, so I’m just going to list a bunch of Issues with my current job.

Working conditions:

* No access to water – Unless asked multiple times, bottles of water will be bought. Never there on bosses own accord.

* Toilet – We work at the bosses house and we have access to one toilet where it’s a lottery if there is toilet paper or not. It is not cleaned and there are just countless spiders and webs everywhere. The final kicker being that we can’t just go in when we need to as his mother does not let us in the toilet because she doesn’t like people being in her house (of colour). So we sometimes have to drive to the nearest public toilet. Furthermore, when we do use the toilet there is no hand wash or sink for us to clean our hands. We use the outside tap and rely on hand sanitizer.

* Tissues – Same deal as water. Only when asked. Have had to resort to being asked to use the toilet paper from the bathroom. Or, get one the workers to buy it and the he’ll later reimburse them (Seems to always forget that part).

* No carparking – I guess this is not that big a deal but since I’ve listed other things I might as well. We initially parked in the front yard. However, his neighbour (his brother) started complaining so we then moved and started parking on the street which then caused visibility and safety issues for not only the public, but ourselves. So we are kind of stuck in limbo without any direction on what to really do.

* Office cleanliness – The office is not cleaned. Again, our own responsibility for our space. Countless webs and dust everywhere. No airflow. The chairs we sit on are broken and are desks have broken drawers etc. I can’t really describe anymore of how unpleasant the working space is.

* Kitchen – This one is quite simple. There is none. No sink, only just got a mini fridge which was a donation from another company (so old and used). A broken microwave which has a permanent “burnt” smell and that’s it. Clients sometimes come in and ask for coffee etc. and we have nothing for them.

* On site Travel – Our job requires us to travel on site in many different locations. Yet we are expected to use our own personal vehicles without any fuel compensation or anything. There have been occasions where we’ve been expected to do these client/site visits outside hours too (including weekends).

 

In regards to issues, that was just to establish the working conditions. The main concern is to do with the actual employment side if things.

Currently I work just the regular 8 hour days. With usually the job going into over the 8 hours due to strict time constraints. (a lot of late nights)

We have been “employed” as sub-contractors but technically work full-time jobs. Under the advice of the company accountant; We were told to set up an ABN and that is how we will earn an income otherwise half our pay will be deducted. I’m not sure how true this is but I believe with this set-up he even claims tax on the income he pays us. (I’m not even going to go into the covid payment schemes that he has manipulated the system with).

Also with this set-up. We have no sick days. No paid leave, no super, no bonuses or any working benefits of any sort.

Then finally comes the pay. I’ve started working with this company during the Covid Pandemic as a way to be exposed to the industry and gain a wealth of hands on experience (which I have). The first 4-6 months were unpaid and I was ok with that. As any kid finishing Uni, all I wanted was an opportunity to learn and be involved with the firm. It was quite clear early how capable I was and my importance to the working team. He then started paying me $500 per week. Again keeping in mind I’m working full-time hours plus more. Fast- track to now I earn $900 per week. Well below the output I give and with the responsibilities I have within the firm. With taking sick days that aren’t covered and having health issues, the public holidays and Christmas break. My end of year earning falls well short of what is expected of my field, maybe even below minimum wage pay.

I’ve always been put under the impression that I have to keep patient or keep working harder and I’ll see the rewards. Hence the reason I’ve stayed working here for so long. And with my nature, I was willing to do as much as I could possibly do to even get a slice of what he was offering. Now I can clearly see that I’ll never get what he says is possible, all the whilst he reaps the benefits of my hard work. What aggrieves me more is that his income from the work that our company does, does not resonate with how the employed are treated or compensated with.

My boss would earn well over $300,000. He pays himself a weekly “salary” plus takes the profits after paying all his workers. With the current cost of living crises, we have to make hard decisions with budgeting everyday whilst our boss takes 2 month holidays to Europe and is able to live his comfortable luxury lifestyle from all the money that we are earning him. It just doesn’t sit well. Just one job alone would be quoted more than my entire yearly earning and I would be doing 80% of the work.

I think the next step for me would be to find a job elsewhere. But I feel as though all the passion I’ve had for the industry has taken a big hit and my confidence become very low. A part of me also feels as though all the hard work and effort I’ve put in with this job hoping it would gain me massive strides within the industry was for nothing. The promises of high pay, connections within the field and other rewards never seemed to come to fruition. It only seemed to always benefit him. Meanwhile I’m always left with how I’m going to afford the next week.

I hope the above makes some sense and I would love to hear what you guys think of the current working conditions and If you guys have any advice for me. I’ve just made this account for this post so thank you in advance for your help.",1,1729061625.0,auscorp,2,1.0,False
1g4ta5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_createdjustforthis23/comments/1g4ta5o/16102024/,16/10/2024,"Well it’s 5:39pm and I’m starting my journal. I feel a mixture of pleased, frustrated, unhappy, happy, disgusted, uneasy and hungry.

**Pleased:** I was anxy about my appointments and I DID IT. And I bussed both ways, right into the middle of town. No uber. I was not feeling good about any of it but I knew I could do it and I knew I could not cancel - I mean I could have but I mean that’s not something good for me y’know I need to do things to get over them - so I did it. I planned it all down to more or less the minute in my notes app incl what busstops to get to, all the bus times, what my stops are and two prior so I could prepare, my appointment times and my notes for them etc etc. It helped a lot. Actually I’m going to put the notes here because I think future me will think it’s funny how I was like this and to show how far I will have come when I don’t do this anymore in the future. Except I’m obvs removing place names and stuff because INTERNET

… so actually not that many notes! I didn’t incl the hair notes because it’s whatever and I’ll surely have a hissy fit about that later in this journal. 

Anyway so I’m pleased because I did what I set out to do. I felt quite… *sensitive*. I don’t know why. But on the bus there I felt really not good and had to try and subtly do my breathing techniques and it didn’t help I started to feel car sick to the point a couple of times I contemplated getting off the bus. And then out and about I felt really on edge and then the bus home I was trying my best to not cry or look like I needed to cry. I feel okay and all I just had a little slip and I think I just felt overwhelmed. Pretty pathetic. 

**Frustrated:** Frustrated because I went in with photos of hair inspo for cut and colour and she butchered it once again. I have a December appointment booked but I’m cancelling it and not going back. I paid $390 to be disappointed. *Again*. And it doesn’t even feel nice because she blow dried it with mousse and then hairsprayed it. It looks like shit. I mean no, it looks okay but it’s not what I asked for and I’m sick to death of it. But I did tell myself this is the final test to see if she does it well and if she doesn’t then time to go elsewhere. Wellllllll it’s time to go elsewhere. And somewhere cheaper because that’s a joke. In fairness I got a $70 treatment on top of usual so the price went up because of that. I don’t understand why she can’t f’ing cut it. I saw a more junior stylist last time and she did it WAY better. And this is one of the best salons in the city. A JOKE. I’m going to find somewhere else. I’m frustrated that I spent practically $400 in this time of living on HAIR THAT ISNT WHAT I ASKED FOR. Done. Done done done. I’m also going elsewhere for my brows - they’re not bad but again, it’s like they just slap on the tint. I do not want to be Cara D ffs. And now I remember she was one of Andy’s celebrity crushes or something and that’s just *excellent* for how I feel right now. 

**Unhappy:** Unhappy because that feeling hit me on the bus home and I just felt filled to the brim with it. 

**Happy:** Happy because I got a library card :)

**Disgusted:** Disgusted with myself. I had to look in the mirror at the salon and I hated it. I spent majority either reading the book I brought with me or looking down at my hands which only made me feel further disgusted as they’re having a flare up or trying to look out the window. And to have people scrutinising me with both brows and hair and shsbsggzvs I just feel gross. 

**Uneasy:** Uneasy because he’s barely talking to me today and he barely talked to me last night and it just makes me feel like he doesn’t want me or I’ve done something or I don’t know. I can understand if he was genuinely tired last night which he said he was which is fine - though he slept longer than I did - but today? Whatever. Not a big deal, I just wanted to get it off my chest to move on. 

**Hungry:** Because it’s 6pm and I’ve not yet eaten. 

I’m just sick of it all and more than anything I’m sick to death of myself. This is a good reminder that the only way to change this feeling is to change myself so *keep going*. 

Tomorrow I will shortlist the final psychiatrists that don’t say they’re unavailable and contact them. He said if I’m not comfy with a male doctor I shouldn’t see one and I’m not comfy with one, but equally there’s a small number of available doctors so at what point do I force myself to get over it? I’m not sure. 

I’ll finish with some positive notes: 

* I got a library card so now I can get books from Libby! I also browsed their shelves for about 40 minutes and it felt like 15. 
* I bought some lip balms 
* I said hello to an elderly person on the bus and they said it back and it was nice
* I saw a greyhound wearing a little coat 
* I started rereading Sum: forty tales from afterlives and I find it really interesting and fun. Such a tiny book with big ideas. I started reading it ages ago and then stopped, I mean it’s the exact kind of book you put down and can pick up a year later. There’s a lot of God talk in it, not in a religious way in an… idea way? Anyway it’s quite funny at times and I love the level of creativity for some of them. 

That’s about it.

This journey has been bonkers. Over the past two years and two months it’s taken me this long to intentionally hit 25 pounds lost. I want to say I’m proud of myself.  Sometimes I’m a little hungry but that’s because I’m not eating around the clock just to eat anymore. I don’t grab coffee 3x a day or every day from the coffee shop, I don’t stop for a bagel in the morning I don’t go out to eat every day with people, because my friends / coworkers do go out to eat every week if not every day together.  I do my best to avoid eating out as much as possible except for planned occasions! And it feels so good. I used to insist on eating right before I go to the gym until my friend explained I have enough fat, that will give me a lot of energy to burn. I don’t need to intentionally carb up before going to the gym! I used to eat even if I wasn’t hungry just for the gym. 

Anyways little changes, a lot of rests and fluctuations along the way but I made it to 25 pounds down. Anything is possible. ",1,1729061345.0,u_Feisty-Exit-974,0,1.0,False

I (24F) was in a really good financial situation last year while my friend (26F) wasn’t. During this time, I would always pay for her coffees, lunch, movie tickets, any activity we did while hanging out, or whenever she would see something she really liked and wasn’t too expensive I would offer to buy it and she would always accept. At some point last year, she had to put down her dog and her bank account went into the negatives, I was there and took care of part of the bill plus paid for the paw print to get made which she wasn’t going to get because she couldn’t afford it. 

I never did this with any expectation of getting paid back, I love my friend and was happy to help her have a more enjoyable life.

This year, tables have turned. I’ve had health problems that have set me back financially, and she knows it. On the other hand, she is doing much better, her business has picked up enough for her to save a considerable amount of money. 

She is the one telling me the amount of money she’s making, yet she has never once offered to pay for my coffee or lunch. She didn’t even get me a present for my birthday. Ngl, it’s making me resent her and not want be so happy about her success. I feel like our value regarding money is very different to the point it’s affecting the way I feel about our friendship.

For me, money comes and goes, and I’ll always have my friends back if they need it. For her, it’s more about her own survival.

An Honest Review of the Popular Weight Loss Supplement,"Are you struggling to lose weight despite countless diets and exercise routines? The frustration of seeing no results can be overwhelming. What if there was a simple solution to boost your metabolism and accelerate fat burning? Enter Java Burn, a revolutionary supplement that claims to do just that. But is Java Burn really worth your time and money? Let's dive deep into this popular weight loss product to uncover the truth.

In the ever-evolving world of weight loss supplements, Java Burn has emerged as a popular contender. Promising to boost metabolism and enhance fat burning, this supplement has garnered attention from those seeking an edge in their weight loss journey. But with so many products on the market, it's crucial to separate fact from fiction. In this article, we'll explore the claims, ingredients, and potential benefits of Java Burn to help you determine if it's worth your investment.

# What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is a powdered supplement designed to be added to your morning coffee. It's marketed as a natural, patent-pending formula that can boost metabolism and promote fat burning when combined with coffee. The product is flavorless and dissolves instantly, making it an easy addition to your daily routine.

**Key features of Java Burn:**

* Natural ingredients
* Flavorless powder
* Designed to work synergistically with coffee
* Claims to boost metabolism and fat burning

# The Science Behind Java Burn

The creators of Java Burn claim that their product works by targeting the root cause of weight gain: a slow metabolism. By combining specific ingredients with caffeine, they suggest that Java Burn can create a ""nutritional synergy"" that enhances the fat-burning effects of your morning coffee.

>""Java Burn is the world's first and only 100% safe and natural proprietary patent-pending formula that when combined with coffee can increase both the speed and efficiency of metabolism. -[ Official Java Burn Website](https://9cbcexte52ql24f7egh8-prn25.hop.clickbank.net)""

While this claim sounds promising, it's essential to examine the scientific evidence behind these statements.

# Ingredients and Their Potential Benefits

Java Burn contains a blend of natural ingredients, each chosen for its potential to support metabolism and weight loss. Let's take a closer look at some of the key components:

1. **Green Tea Extract**: Rich in catechins, particularly EGCG, which may boost metabolism and increase fat oxidation.
2. **L-Theanine**: An amino acid that can help reduce the jitters often associated with caffeine consumption.
3. **L-Carnitine**: An amino acid that plays a role in fatty acid metabolism and energy production.
4. **Chromium**: A mineral that may help regulate blood sugar levels and reduce cravings.
5. **Chlorogenic Acid**: Found in green coffee beans, this compound may help slow the absorption of carbohydrates.

While these ingredients have shown promise in various studies, it's important to note that the specific blend and dosages in Java Burn may not have been extensively studied as a combined formula.

# Potential Benefits of Java Burn

**Based on its ingredients and claims, Java Burn may offer several potential benefits:**

* **Increased Metabolism**: The combination of green tea extract and caffeine may help boost metabolic rate.
* **Enhanced Fat Burning**: Ingredients like L-carnitine and green tea extract may support fat oxidation.
* **Improved Energy Levels**: The synergy between coffee and Java Burn's ingredients could provide sustained energy throughout the day.
* **Better Blood Sugar Control**: Chromium may help regulate blood sugar levels, potentially reducing cravings.
* **Antioxidant Support**: Green tea extract and chlorogenic acid offer antioxidant properties.

**Possible Drawbacks and Considerations**

While Java Burn appears to offer several potential benefits, there are some factors to consider:

1. **Limited Scientific Evidence**: While individual ingredients have been studied, the specific Java Burn formula lacks extensive clinical trials.
2. **Cost**: At around $49 per pouch (30-day supply), Java Burn is more expensive than many other supplements.
3. **Caffeine Dependency**: The product is designed to be used with coffee, which may not be suitable for everyone.
4. **Individual Variations**: As with any supplement, results may vary from person to person.

# User Experiences and Testimonials

While individual experiences can vary, many users have reported positive results with Java Burn. Some common themes in user testimonials include:

* Increased energy levels
* Gradual weight loss
* Reduced cravings
* Improved focus and concentration

>""I've been using Java Burn for two months now, and I've already lost 15 pounds. I feel more energetic, and my cravings have significantly decreased."" - Sarah, 34

It's important to approach testimonials with a critical eye, as individual results can be influenced by various factors, including diet, exercise, and overall lifestyle.

# Is Java Burn Worth It? The Verdict

Determining whether Java Burn is worth it depends on your individual goals, budget, and expectations. Here are some key points to consider:

* **Potential Benefits**: The ingredients in Java Burn have shown promise in supporting metabolism and weight loss.
* **Convenience**: Adding a flavorless powder to your morning coffee is an easy way to incorporate a supplement into your routine.
* **Cost**: While more expensive than some alternatives, it may be worth it if you experience positive results.
* **Safety**: The natural ingredients are generally considered safe for most people, but it's always wise to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement.

Ultimately, if you're looking for a supplement to complement your weight loss efforts and don't mind the cost, Java Burn may be worth trying. However, it's crucial to maintain realistic expectations and remember that no supplement can replace a healthy diet and regular exercise.

# Key Takeaways

* Java Burn is a powdered supplement designed to boost metabolism and enhance fat burning when added to coffee.
* The product contains natural ingredients with potential weight loss benefits, including green tea extract, L-carnitine, and chromium.
* While individual ingredients show promise, the specific Java Burn formula lacks extensive clinical trials.
* User experiences are generally positive, with reports of increased energy and gradual weight loss.
* The cost may be a consideration, but some users find the potential benefits worth the investment.

# Final Thoughts

If you're considering trying Java Burn, it's essential to approach it as part of a comprehensive weight loss strategy. While it may provide a helpful boost to your metabolism, it's not a magic solution. Combine it with a balanced diet, regular exercise, and healthy lifestyle habits for the best results.

Remember, what works for one person may not work for another. If you decide to try Java Burn, monitor your progress and listen to your body. And as always, consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.

I stopped at 3 yesterday, stopped at 3 today. Tried the trick where I mixed it with my hot coffee. I have also taken 2 dulcolax (not together, about 8 hours apart and just took the second one a few minutes ago,) as well as a dulcolax suppository (which I ended up on the toilet with VERY MINIMAL results 10 mins later, I was not feeling good and couldn't hold onto it anymore).

All the scenes with Cain are either funny/unhinged or bittersweet and melancholic.

I love the angst and tension these two have going on.

  You can cut the tension with a knife and then break the said knife 🤭 

There's so many hints that he might've known her prior, what their relationship might've been like, that's up for speculation, my guess acquaintances, perhaps friends?
   bruh, for all we know they used to have coffee every

 Sunday morning, before the apocalypse happened 🤣

Stupid jokes aside.

When she thanks him for saving her from the rift, he responds with
''You're welcome, it was necessary.''
 although he just means it was important to save her because of her position as a cryptographer and Cain is interested in the book for personal reasons, that's what he meant probably.


In this scene she's like.
''I don't need a babysitter. Get out!''
Cain just disregards her request entirely and stays by her bed anyway.

Could've also brought her tea and tucked her in, while he's at it 🤣 

I think he did pretty well for the first time as a nurse 🤣 

If you ignore the fact he was wondering if a larger dose of those pills could kill her 🤣 

Swallowing  fucking capsules is hard without water, not the most pleasant feeling, I've choked on them myself before 🤣

All this in peak evening traffic in rain. The guy seemed determined and apologetic so I am like dude chill. See if you can get it, otherwise chuck it, it will end up being cancelled. 

2 hours in, our man, my hero, showed up!

He was still smiling and all sorry! I consoled him and said I will not complain but i need his pic for memory of this story lol.

I have Aeropress since July. I've already experienced with different variables, but maybe not a lot as I didn't have much varieties of coffee.

So, why do you think in the aeropress instruction there is 40s only (10s stirring and let sit for 30s)?
Only cold brew instruction takes 1min.
