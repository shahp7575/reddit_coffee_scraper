My best friend and I are coming up for the Holland Tulip Festival for an overnight and staying in Saugatuck. We’d like to go on a tour of independent book stores in the area. We are both moms and this is my first trip ever away from my kids and I am so excited for a little rest. We’d love to know about any children’s bookstores, social justice centered, unique books, etc. also cute boutiques, coffee shops, crafty stores, etc.

Thank you for all of the ideas!!!",1,1769783215.0,grandrapids,0,1.0,False
1qr6vou,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1qr6vou/would_you_take_a_lower_pay_potential_for_better/,Would you take a lower pay potential for better stability?,"Currently I work at a big tech company. I just got promoted and make around 250K a year. 

My current job is mostly great. Manager is pro-wlb, lets me mostly pick my own work on what to do. 

But the company itself sucks. They enforce 5 day RTO, starting to track hours in the office, and they seem to be doing constant layoffs year over year. My team has been spared all the layoffs for the past 5 years and my manager lets me coffee badge since I'm the only one in the area for my team, but I fear they will start cracking down on it. Theirs also always the risk of being told one day to relocate to where the manager is located or resign. It's also kinda've dawned on me that being remote for the past 5 years or so has given me social anxiety and I've atrophied all my social skills, which has effected my mental health (going to therapy for this). I pretty much spend everyday either coffee badging and working remote, or just working in the office alone and doing all meetings virtually.

Since I just got promoted, I get put into the bottom of the compensation band for my new role. So realistically in 1-2 years I could maybe make 260-290k.

However, I somehow got a job offer for a new local place for 200K base, and a 40k ""target bonus). It would be 3 day hybrid, and the culture of the place seems ok. They also offered to pay out approximately 90k of my unvested stock at my old company, which would be around a 90k sign on bonus with a 4 year clawback. It sounded like they wanted to groom me into becoming a lead (which I'm ambivalent about, especially since I've been remote for so long). 

Compensation wise, the new place is more iffy then the big tech company. With big tech theirs a very clear and outlined promotion process with salary bands. With the new place, I am not sure if I'll actually be able to get into that lead role (or whether I'd even like it), or would I have any real potential for higher compensation. I also don't really like how the 40k is a discretionary bonus (although from what my friend said, it sounds like they mostly hit it) vs the tech companies guaranteed stock awards. 

I'm thinking of just accepting it to grow back my social skills and work on mental health.. It might mean slightly less money long-term but better upfront money as well. I am just unsure if my reluctance to accept is my social anxieties avoidant behavior about having to work in a office and interact with people again or trade-offs.",1,1769783183.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

I really value meaningful connections and enjoy getting to know people from ditterent cultures and backgrounds.

To be honest, making genuine friendships here hasn't always been easy, and lately I've been feeling a bit lonely.

So l've decided that 2026 is the year I change that!

I enjoy deep, thoughtful conversations, long walks by the sea, discovering new cafés or food spots, artistic activities like pottery, and sharing simple moments of everyday life.

I'm more into good vibes, kindness, and authenticity than anything flashy.

I'm not necessarily looking for big parties, but rather genuine connections, whether that's chatting, going for a walk, grabbing a coffee, or trying something new together.

1qr6vbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1qr6vbj/the_things_my_house_started_forgetting/,The Things My House Started Forgetting,"I used to believe routines were proof that life was stable.

Every morning at 6:40, the coffee machine clicked on by itself. At 6:55, the heater hummed even if the weather didn’t need it. At exactly 7:10, my phone alarm rang, though I often woke up a minute before it.

That was how I knew the house was working. How I knew I was.

I live alone. No pets. No roommates. Just me and a quiet two-bedroom house on the edge of town, the kind people buy because it’s affordable and forgettable.

The first thing the house forgot was the mirror.

One morning, I brushed my teeth and noticed the bathroom mirror had a thin crack running through it—straight down the middle, like a hairline fracture. I was certain it hadn’t been there the night before. I would’ve noticed. I always noticed things like that.

Still, mirrors crack. Houses settle. I went to work and didn’t think about it again.

The second thing was the hallway light.

I always left it on at night. Always. It made the house feel less empty. But one evening, I walked out of my bedroom and nearly tripped in the dark. The switch was flipped down.

I stood there longer than I should have, heart beating faster than logic allowed.

Maybe I turned it off without realizing it.

That explanation became my favorite one.

Over the next week, small things kept changing. A chair pulled slightly away from the table. A door not fully closed. The smell of soap I didn’t use lingering in the bathroom.

The house wasn’t adding things.

It was misplacing them.

Then came the sounds.

At first, it was just at night—a faint shifting noise, like someone adjusting their weight on a mattress. I told myself it was the pipes. Old houses talk, people say that like it explains anything.

But one night, half asleep, I heard breathing.

Not close. Not loud.

Just… present.

I sat up in bed and listened until my chest hurt. When it stopped, I stayed awake until morning, lights on, routine broken.

That was when the house forgot the calendar.

I had a paper calendar on the fridge. I used it because it made days feel real. One Tuesday, I realized the date was wrong. Not crossed out. Not torn.

Just… skipped.

Three days were missing.

No marks. No notes. No memory of them.

I checked my phone. Same thing. My call history jumped. Messages ended mid-conversation and resumed as if nothing had happened.

At work, my boss asked if I was feeling better.

“Better than what?” I asked.

He gave me a look people give when they think you’re fragile. “You took time off. You said you needed it.”

I went home early that day.

The house felt heavier, like it was holding its breath.

That evening, I finally checked the spare bedroom. I hadn’t been in there in months. The door resisted when I pushed it open, like it didn’t want to remember what was inside.

The bed was unmade.

Not dusty. Not untouched.

Used.

On the nightstand was a glass of water, half full. Next to it, a notebook I didn’t recognize.

Inside were my handwriting.

Dates I didn’t remember. Pages filled with observations. Patterns. Warnings.

The house doesn’t hurt you. It hides you.

You asked it to.

This is the cost.

The last page was different. Shakier.

If you’re reading this and you still feel like yourself, you need to stop.

Open the windows. Let people in.

The house only forgets what you give it permission to forget.

I slept on the couch that night. No breathing. No sounds.

In the morning, I opened every window. Let the cold in. Let the noise in. I called my sister for the first time in months. Told her I wasn’t okay.

She came over that afternoon.

The house felt smaller with someone else inside it. Less confident.

Some things never came back. Those missing days are still gone. There are parts of my life I know I traded for quiet, for routine, for not feeling alone.

But the house remembers less now.

And every morning, when the coffee machine doesn’t turn on by itself, I make it manually—

just to remind the house that I’m awake,

1qr6t6d,https://i.redd.it/u333kzmjxhgg1.png,I've created my perfect bag and it's a customized ruck,"This is a Huckberry GR1 Slick 26L—the flat front / no MOLLE version. I bought it because I wanted something durable that didn’t look tactical.

At some point I sent it to SCARS, which is where rational budgeting ends.

Between the original bag and the work I had done, it went from an already not-cheap Huckberry pack into something that cost an extremely unreasonable amount of money. It crossed the line from “inexpensive luxury backpack” into “bespoke, mildly unhinged financial decision.” I’m not proud of that, but I’m also not pretending it didn’t happen. This is probably one of those “what about my retirement” moments.

The SCARS work added side compression straps, side handles, and a bottom handle. I added a Camelbak sternum strap, strap keepers from Miltaur, and later a RuckSport morale patch I bought from someone in the GORUCK community. The patch helps it read less like a ruck and more like a normal backpack, which I prefer.

Around the same time I was rereading William Gibson, specifically Zero History. One of the ideas in that book is how fashion and military gear constantly bleed into each other. Designers chase military surplus—pants, jackets, colors—strip away the obvious function, and reintroduce it as civilian fashion. By the time the military adopts something officially, it’s often already been filtered through streetwear and high fashion.

Coyote Brown sits right in that overlap. It’s a military color, but it doesn’t behave like black, Ranger Green, OD, or camo. With the slick front and no MOLLE, it stops reading as tactical and starts reading as just… neutral. Normal. Civilian.

At some point I realized I’d accidentally landed in the same tan/beige/brown palette that Gen Z seems completely obsessed with right now, without trying to. It blends into the general fashion background instead of standing out as “gear.”

Since then I’ve gone through a bunch of other bags—shoulder bags, courier bags, bigger packs, including a GR2 34L. I’ve sold things, rebought things, tried to optimize my setup. This one keeps coming back.

It’s not a ruck anymore. No plates, no weight. It’s just my everyday carry work bag.

I leave my apartment around 8am and get back around 8pm. No car. Everything on foot. Coffee shops, digital marketing work, errands, meetings. I need to be self-sufficient all day and I also need the walking. This bag handles that without drawing attention.

There’s no resale logic left here, which is probably why it stuck. It stopped being theoretical and became mine.

Curious what people here think—does a GR1 26L make sense as everyday carry if you’re out all day on foot? Or is it still overkill once it stops being a ruck?",1,1769783018.0,backpacks,0,1.0,False

I decided to order a amazon screen to see if it worked and it did!

I know it was a mistake I'm going to return and get a screen from IFix it.  

So main question is are screens likely to just quit like that??? I should of added above that its showed no signs of damage no cracks or dings nothing was deformed the phone looked fine. When replacing the screen no water damage indicators were triggered.  

Or do you guys think something else is going on and its not worth the $250 screen to fix just to have something else kill that one or the phone just quit in a few months???

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.

The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.

Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.

I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.

I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.

Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.

The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.

Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.

I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.

I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.

Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

I have not seen any other reports or photos, and want to make sure that we're not causing panic among our community if the report is mistaken. If not, that's good the person added it, but in the future if you submit something to iceout (people over papers), make sure to call or text TPRR, and use the SALUTE method of observing:

S - size. How many agents, vehicles, and/or agencies?

A - Activity. What were they doing? What kinds of job duties were they doing or were they just getting coffee? (believe me, I wish they weren't here at all, but it's important to discern whether or not the activity could be threatening i.e. asking for an individual, holding weapons, knocking on doors, or not tied to operations or raids like eating lunch)

  
L - Location, be as specific as possible without giving away any identifying information about who the target of the operation may have been.

Not because I didn’t love him, but because I love myself more. We’ve known each other since May 2025, started out as casual but obviously developed into more. He has always been inconsistent, going missing randomly for days on end. I’ve told him repeatedly that I don’t mind how long you go for, I just need to know when it happens. Go for 2 weeks. Hell, go for 3. When he’d come back from those stints, obviously there’s tension in the air (for all of 5 mins).

1qr6lej,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1qr6lej/my_parents_didnt_celebrate_my_language_learning/,"My parents didn't celebrate my language learning accomplishments, so I celebrated on my terms","When my parents picked me up from the German board game night at Yale, my dad immediately asked me if I messed up speaking German. I stated no because if I said yes (i.e., I made some minor pronunciation mistakes at the event), he would have grilled me. He didn't even ask me who I talked to, the board games I was playing, or what I talked about in German. 

Meanwhile, my mom complained about me talking in German too loudly when I saw my sister's dog and lectured me on what to do with the minor damages I caused with someone else's car. I told her that I'm already in contact with the person whose car I damaged and am taking care of it. 

For reference, I played two different board games in German, using as much German as possible, for almost two hours. I played a game where I had to find the exact location of lesser-known German cities: west or east; north, middle, or south; which zone number it was; and the zone letter within the zone number. It was hard because I realized how little I knew about German geography and German cities outside well-known ones. The second board game was Scrabble in German. It was actually hard thinking of words to make, especially with the letters that I was given.

I'm actually even angrier at my mom because I accidentally damaged someone else's car back in Ithaca last year, and the damages were much worse. I handled all of that plus paying the person back for the damages I caused in full, which was more than $2000 without car insurance, on my own.

My mom doesn't think I can handle a similar incident on my own. She doesn't even ask me, ""How have you been handling it"", thinking that I need to be lectured on what to do instead of asking me what I did. I have already been in contact with the person that I contacted ever since I caused the minor damages to her mirror.

Even after the Norwegian coffee date, which was yesterday, my parents didn't even ask me what I did. My dad asked no questions, and my mom just started lecturing me again. I told her calmly that she actually texted me that they didn't go to the repair shop yet to repair the car. She kept quiet after that. She didn't even ask me what I did at Starbucks.

At my Norwegian coffee date, I studied Norwegian for three hours. To start off, I had a cappuccino and a chocolate chip cookie. I looked up what kinds of coffee Norwegians drink and what they pair with their coffee. I watched at least 15-18 minutes of a Norwegian podcast with Magnus Carlsen (famous Norwegian chess player) talking about chess training, alcohol, and chess competitions at the youth and junior divisions. I paused the video almost every second because the content was difficult, and I ended up learning **LOTS** of new words. I also spoke Norwegian to myself for over two minutes and journaled in Norwegian. 

I enjoyed both of my language dates to celebrate the end of a successful language-learning month. 

Instead of sharing my language learning achievements with my Filipino parents (they don't care to be honest). The one time I confronted my mom about why she's not being excited for my achievements in another hobby, rock climbing, she got angry at me. Instead of expecting my parents to celebrate with me, I celebrated on my own and told my friends about it. I also posted about it because I'm very proud of being consistent with my language learning, even with all the job applications (research jobs in psychology), job interviews (research jobs in psychology and corporate data analytics roles), and other hobbies I have in life (rock climbing and journaling). In fact, I started a new Yale research assistant position, and I'm really excited about it despite my parents not asking me ANY questions whatsoever about my lab (Psychology Lab at Yale) and my dad not taking it seriously.

TLDR: My Asian parents didn't care about what I did in my language dates to celebrate a successful month of learning languages in the new year, 2026. I celebrated them by planning language dates, telling my friends about it, and posting it on social media. This lack of celebrating also extends to my unpaid research assistant position at a Yale psychology lab.",3,1769782502.0,AsianParentStories,0,1.0,False
1qr6l59,https://www.reddit.com/r/goodomens/comments/1qr6l59/aziraphales_bookshop/,Aziraphale's Bookshop,"A month or 2 ago, I ran across an amazing fanfic. I tried to share it with a friend a few days ago and realized it has disappeared. I'm heartbroken. It was such a moving piece of writing.

I am not sure of the name of the story or the author, but Google AI did give me what might be the right information. I'm just not sure. The story it named also does not appear anywhere online at this time.

I would love to ask the author if he/she/they might share it with me. Or if any of you might have a copy saved, would you please share it with me?

The story might be called ""A Most Holy and Propitious Endeavour"" and the author may be lass\_that\_waits.

Here is the story, as I recall:

It was set post season 2. Aziraphale had gone to heaven with the Metatron, who led him to a recreation of his bookshop in heaven to wait while the Metatron and the angels made ready for Supreme Archangel Aziraphale to begin his work. Each time Aziarphale tries to leave the ""bookshop"" he is intercepted by a VERY helpful angel who was sent by the Metatron to provide Aziraphale anything he needs or wants. For a while, he is mollified by the gifts of fresh sushi and coffees from this angel. But gradually Aziraphale becomes too demanding for the angel to ""handle"", so the Metatron comes to try and pacify him. Eventually his need to connect to Crowley is too great, and he breaks out and returns to London. There he locates Crowley, who has been hunted and nearly killed by the angel who was supposed to be providing Aziraphale anything he needs, and nurses him back to life and health. However, when Crowley is finally conscious, he rejects Aziraphale. The rest of the story is the exploration of and healing from the various traumas and hurts between Crowley and Aziraphale.

After that pumunta kami sa coffee shop, sumama naman siya. Sabi niya samin nag-away daw sila ng gf niya dahil dun. Tumawa ako after hearing that kasi parang gusto niyang umiyak dun hahaha kinall out ko yung mga kagagawan niya tas sabi ko he shouldn’t act surprised.

I may tell you that I attach little importance to knowledge. I’m not interested in what’s learnt.” These words were not incompatible with Mme de Cambremer’s own particular quality, which was precisely imitated and acquired. But it so happened that one of the things one was required to know at that moment was that knowledge is nothing, and is not worth a straw when compared with originality. Mme de Cambremer had learned, with everything else, that one ought not to learn anything. “That is why,” she explained to me, “Brichot, who has an interesting side to him, for I’m not one to despise a certain lively erudition, interests me far less.”



Proust making fun of the upper class tendency to value intelligence and originality over knowledge and achievement gained through effort and work.

1qr6fal,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFWr4rIndia/comments/1qr6fal/32_m4f_mumbai_new_to_this_city_and_i_dont_know/,32 [M4F] Mumbai - New to this city and I dont know anyone. Looking to make new friends.,"
I will start with the most problematic part first, I am married. So if you don't want to do this, you shouldn't have to waste any more time. 

Well, this one is a bit unconventional, and I have never done this before. 

I am a 32 year old guy who is on a work trip to Mumbai and I am planning to stay here for a couple of weeks. Sounds simple, doesn't it ? 

But it isn't. I dont intend on spending my evenings alone walking down hotel lobbies or just meaninglessly wandering around the local roads. I need company. Someone to talk to. Someone who can show me around. Someone who could help me apartment hunting for a longer trip next time?

All this may sound like a dream, or a really unrealistic situation, but I am in my early thirties and most of my friends and colleagues are busy with life, kids and have moved on. And I do feel left behind sometimes. 

For starters, I am decent looking and well mannered. I like reading and spend my evenings mostly reading books or watching sitcoms. Friends and HIMYM are my guilty pleasure, but I also loved Seinfeld, B99 and The Big Bang Theory. 

I hope we can have conversations over coffee, strolling around or just casually hanging out. What I seek is good company and a chill time. I am alone in a new city with no friends. 

I do not know what else to write? Maybe you are curious about my post and have some questions on your mind ? Feel free to reach out and I will try to answer them honestly. If nothing comes out of it, I can atleast try to make the conversation worth your time. ",1,1769782097.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

And I am here for it!,"This is a newsletter post from Moving Offline. If you'd like to check it out in its original format, [click here.](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/social-media-companies-are-scared)

# Introduction

I’ve always been told not to declare early victories, the way Napoleon did at the [Battle of Leipzig](https://amzn.to/3ZESnDn), because the moment you assume the fight is already won is the moment you stop paying attention to what is happening around you. At Leipzig, Napoleon believed he could defeat the Allies the same way he had beaten so many coalitions before: quickly, decisively, and with sheer force of will. Tech companies, so far, have acted similarly. They [monopolized our attention](https://www.emerald.com/books/edited-volume/13596/chapter-abstract/84297494/Rethinking-Remedies-for-the-Attention-Economy), [distracted us from the fight for digital rights](https://petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2024/10/14/addictive-design-and-social-media-legal-opinions-and-research-roundup/), and convinced us that resistance was futile because their platforms were too big, too addictive, and too deeply woven into daily life to ever be challenged.

[Book: Your Face Belongs To Us](https://amzn.to/3Z782et)

But the tide is changing, just as it did at Leipzig. [Governments have begun to restrict social media access for minors](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyp9d3ddqyo).[1](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/social-media-companies-are-scared#footnote-1-186220375) [Companies are settling in court ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/what-to-know-about-a-trial-that-will-test-tech-giants-liability-for-child-social-media-addiction)after leaked documents showed they knew their products were addictive from the start. And everyday people are quietly looking for alternatives[2](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/social-media-companies-are-scared#footnote-2-186220375), choosing simpler devices, smaller platforms, or even stepping away from digital overload. The momentum that once seemed unstoppable is beginning to shift, and the companies that once felt untouchable are starting to feel the pressure.

And I am here for it!!!

For too long, we’ve been told to trust that [tech would regulate itself](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/07/22/1095193/ai-companies-promised-the-white-house-to-self-regulate-one-year-ago-whats-changed/). We were reassured, again and again, that the companies hijacking our lives would eventually build the safeguards we needed. [Instead, we were misled and exploited](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/04/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism-assault-human-automomy-digital-privacy). The promises of protection never matched the reality of products designed to keep us hooked. These recent wins are small, and they won’t erase technology’s presence in our lives, but they do signal something important. People are waking up. We’re beginning to reclaim a bit of agency in a digital world that once felt impossible to push back against.

And because momentum grows through small, steady steps, I want to offer three simple practices in this newsletter. They’re not dramatic or complicated, but they can help you create a little more distance, a little more breathing room, and a little more independence from the big tech systems that have shaped so much of our attention for the last 15 years.

[](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1474552226712-ac0f0961a954?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHxicmVhayUyMHVwfGVufDB8fHx8MTc2OTcxMTcwMHww&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080)

# Shrink The Tech Window

One of the simplest ways to loosen tech’s grip on your life is to reduce the moments when it can knock your focus off balance. Most of us wake up and immediately hand over our attention to a screen. We check messages before we check in with ourselves. That’s why it helps to engineer your mornings so your thoughts can surface before the algorithm crowds them out. A small shift can make a big difference:

* Leave your phone outside the bedroom and keep a journal on your nightstand. [If you need extra help sticking to this, buy a lockbox for your phone that only opens up when the timer runs out.](https://amzn.to/3ZrJrRX)
* Take your dog for a walk without your phone and listen to the world waking up.

These small choices create a buffer between you and the digital void. Delaying that first interaction with tech gives you room to reflect and begin the day with your own mind rather than someone else’s feed.

Evenings deserve the same kind of care. A shutdown time creates a soft landing for your mind. [Many sleep specialists encourage avoiding screens](https://amzn.to/49TPYcA) for a couple of hours before bed because the mind needs a chance to unwind without constant stimulation. You do not have to be perfect about it. You simply need a boundary that signals the day is ending and your attention is no longer up for grabs.

Interestingly, this mirrors what researchers have found in [studies on time‑restricted eating](https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/43/2/405/6371193). When people limit the hours in which they eat, even without changing what they eat, many experience improvements in energy, sleep patterns, and overall well‑being. The body responds to boundaries. It likes knowing when to be “on” and when it can rest. Our minds work the same way. The benefit doesn’t come from doing more. It comes from creating space.

# Find Your Offline Crew

You’d be surprised by how many people in your area are looking for companions on the journey against big tech. Last year, I started showing up at a local coffee community meeting here in Colorado.[3](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/social-media-companies-are-scared#footnote-3-186220375) The event had nothing to do with [dumbphones ](https://dumbphones.org)or offline life, but this small breakfast hangout has delivered some of the most thoughtful conversations I’ve had in years.

Yes, the online world has its place. Forums, Reddit threads, and digital communities can offer support when it feels like none is available. They can be lifelines when you need quick advice or a sense of solidarity. However, the local, embedded human touch is irreplaceable. There is no substitute for the presence of real people in real places who can look you in the eye. That kind of connection is only palpable offline. Therefore, it is our aim to find it as quickly as possible.

Fortunately, we do not have to look far to find these gatherings. There is real momentum behind offline events right now, and if you happen to live in Europe, it is even easier thanks to groups like [The Offline Club](https://www.theoffline-club.com/). But you do not need a formal organization to begin. Start at the library or scan the community board at your local coffee shop. Join an event, put it on your calendar, show up, and enjoy it. And if nothing exists yet, use the internet, including sites like [meetup.com](https://meetup.com), to organize something or to ask whether a group is already forming. This simple idea can open the door to a richer offline life and a closer‑knit community around you.

[](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517456793572-1d8efd6dc135?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxnYXRoZXJpbmd8ZW58MHx8fHwxNzY5NzIzODQyfDA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080)

# Plan Your Weekly Reset

The final practice in this newsletter is where you start playing offense. Finding friends and guarding the edges of your day are important defenses against digital distraction, but a weekly reset is where you design the lifestyle you actually want. It is the moment when you intentionally put offline life at the center of each day in the week ahead.

Now let me be clear. Your weekly reset practice does not need to be complicated. In fact, it should be simple enough that you can repeat it every week without thinking. A weekly reset includes three things:

* First, review how much time you spent last week on your devices. Look at the numbers without judgment. Just get honest about where your attention actually went.
* Second, take a moment to reflect on how you want that to change in the upcoming week. What would “better” look like for you? More walks with your dog? Longer conversations with your mom (she would appreciate it!!)? An earlier bedtime?
* Third, make a commitment to yourself to follow through. Write it down. Say it out loud. Put it on your calendar! Remember: consistency beats ambition every time.

I do this every week with my wife. We sit down, look at the upcoming week, and reset our mindset to beat the bad habits we’ve picked up along the way (my dirty dishes are calling). You don’t need to wait until January of next year to set up a goal. You can start today.

And don’t forget to make it yours. If you want to add other practices to your weekly reset, do it. Maybe that means meditation, journaling, or a short conversation with someone you trust. Maybe its switching to a [dumbphone](https://dumbphones.org) during the weekend to clear your mind from the notification overload. Whatever it is, just be consistent about it. When you build this rhythm into your week, you stop sliding back into digital chaos and start living with intention.

# Conclusion

Leipzig was not the end of the war, but it was the turning point, and that is exactly where we are now. The tide is turning, but the work of reclaiming our attention from big tech is far from over. New tools will emerge, new pressures will surface, and there may even be moments when it feels as if the world expects total dependence on our devices. But you, my Leipzig ally, will be ready. You know that living a fully human life does not mean rejecting technology outright. It means refusing to surrender your agency to it. And that is the real victory. Not a world without technology, but a world where you choose how to live. A world where your attention finally belongs to you again.",1,1769782085.0,dumbphones,0,1.0,False

Today, I finally got my first Numerology client. I quoted her just 3 us.d because I really needed the gig.

But when she tried to pay, the transaction kept failing due to international banking restrictions. I felt defeated, but I decided to send her the finished PDF for free anyway. I had already done the work, and honestly, I just wanted the feedback to know if I was any good.

An hour later, my phone buzzed.

She had gone out of her way to find my ""Buy Me A Coffee"" link (which I didn't even know was working) and sent me 15 instead of the 3. She included a note saying 3 bucks wasn't enough for the effort and that she loved my cat (my ""manager"" ).

I know 12 dolars isn't a lot to some people, but as someone scraping by right now, it made me cry. It wasn't just the money though that helps buy groceries, it was the fact that my work was actually appreciated.

The internet can be a harsh place, but sometimes it’s incredibly kind. The first wins are always the most special. Me and my cat will be fed for a while. Thank you kind stranger.",12,1769782077.0,wholesome,3,0.93,False

1qr6d3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qr6d3l/nf_life_passes_fast/,[NF] Life Passes Fast," She attempted to catch my eyes as she moved the chain to allow us passage to leave the hockey game. With only minutes remaining in the game and with our hometown team up 10-1, my wife and I had decided to leave a bit early to beat traffic. I was stunned to see my ex-girlfriend from almost twenty years before working at the event. Although I had moved back to my hometown several years before, I had not encountered her in any type of social setting. Unlike many people my age, I am not active on social media.

 I deliberately acted like I hadn't noticed who was assisting us as we exited the arena. I did not want to engage and be forced to explain my past history with this random woman to my beautiful wife. 

After we exited the building and climbed into my truck, my wife asked me who the woman at the stadium was. She had noticed my ex-girlfriends behavior and it had irritated her. I was honest and told her the truth about our shared past.

Almost twenty years before, I had a disastrous relationship with Haile. I had found out about her cheating on me in the worst way possible. It was honestly one of the moments that I felt shaped the rest of my life up to this point.

Throughout high school, Hailey and I were absolutely inseparable. At that moment in time, I was certain that we would be that white picket fence couple with the kids and the dog. Our lives were so entwined that I couldn't go anywhere by myself without someone asking where Haile was. 

After graduating,  we got a small apartment by our local community college. I started attending classes and it seemed like life was on track. Most of my friends had taken jobs working in construction or in the oilfield industry. I was determined to get my degree and have a lot more stable life than what I grew up with. I woke up daily at 4am to study before going to work. It was difficult and exhausting but I felt like I was building for the future.

My life abruptly changed on her birthday.  I was working with my dad that day to make extra money to bring her out to do something nice. After paying for rent, utilities, insurance, and food, I rarely had a lot of disposable income to treat us to a nice night out. I called her numerous times that day without an answer. I was starting to get really worried about her as this was out of character for her to not answer.

After going home to clean off paint, sheetrock dust and mud, and general dirtiness, I got into my truck to go find her. I felt I deserved an explanation why she hadn't answered any of my calls on her birthday. 

I drove over to her parents house and when I arrived, I saw her car in the driveway. I immediately thought she had been busy with her family. That would certainly excuse her not being available.  When her dad answered the door, I saw the expression on his face and I knew that something was wrong.  He stepped outside and told me that it wasn't a good time for me to come in. 

I told him that I deserved an explanation and he looked uncomfortable as he called Haile outside. He told her that she should be honest with me. When she came outside, she told me she had been talking to someone else for several months and he was inside. She said she hoped that j wouldn't cause a scene about it and that we would talk about it later.

I looked at her coldly. My parents had struggled with infidelity and it had disrupted my childhood terribly. Loud arguments, broken furniture, and a general feeling of tension were the normal in my childhood home. I turned and shook her father's hand. I told him that I appreciated the honesty but it was most likely the last time that we would be around each other. He pulled me into a hug and called her mother outside. She saw me and gave me a hug as well. I told them that they should come pick up Haile's things from my apartment the next morning.  When Haile started to say anything, I told her the conversation was over. She immediately started to cry and ask me to at least talk to her about it. It is difficult to describe the feeling I had at that moment. I was completely detached and it was almost like watching someone else's life fall apart.

I got into my truck to leave and Haile moved to stand behind me go block me from leaving. I told her to get out of my way unless she wanted me to go talk to her new guy real close. He had stayed inside the house throughout the entire interaction.  Haile was crying hysterically as I pulled out of the driveway.

When I got home, I called my best friend to vent. He was quiet at first but eventually told me that many of our friends had known for a while about Haile's cheating. He said that they had decided to stay out of it and not pick sides. I told him that by not telling me, they had each chosen a side. I hung up the phone that night and it was the last time that we talked. The next time I saw him was at his funeral a year later. 

That night, I packed all of her possessions into boxes and stacked them neatly in my living room. I removed all the pictures from the frames and brought them to my brother's house. My brother and I watched the pictures burn in the bonfire as we drank cold beer and listened to some Stevie Ray Vaugn.

The next day, I went to visit my mom to tell her the news. She had always loved Haile and I wanted her to hear it from me directly.  After she made coffee, we sat at her dining table and I told her the entire story. She told me that I seemed remarkably composed. After I told her I felt like perhaps I was still in shock, she nodded and we sat in silence for awhile.

She asked me if there was any chance of reconciliation.  I shook my head no and told her that while I hoped I didn't hurt her feelings,  I didn't want the life that she and my dad had endured for years. They had divorced after I graduated high school and both of parents seemed dramatically happier. I had no doubts that they loved me but they despised each other. She told me that she understood and wished she had ended things with my dad years earlier. 

She told me that the Air Force recruiter had been calling her house almost daily and that I should call to tell them that I wasn't interested and that I was in school. I called the recruiter back but things took an unexpected turn.He convinced me to set an appointment for the next day.

When I arrived at the Air Force office, there wasn't a single light on in the office. I almost laughed at the absurdity of the situation. He had called daily but couldn't show up to an appointment on time. 

I was about to leave when a voice called out to stop me. A tall Marine stood outside the Marine Corps recruiting office. He asked if I was serious about joining the military. I laughed as I replied that I had never once considered it. I was just there for information. He asked if I would talk to him and I made a snap decision that would change my life forever as I agreed to hear what he had to say.

After talking to SSgt Ball about college benefits, travel and adventure,  and other military benefits, I went into the delayed entry program. After finding out that just about everyone that I considered a friend had betrayed me, I felt like a needed a change of scenery.  He set up a visit to MEPS and before I knew it, I was on my way to thirteen weeks of absolute hell. I hated boot camp every single day but I kept pushing forward and graduated. 

After finishing my technical school, I did ten years while I completed my Master's degree. When the time came to get out, I knew without a doubt it was time. I had traveled the world, made lifelong friends, but my father's health was fading fast. Years of hard drinking had greatly shortened his life.

When I returned to my hometown,  I was fortunate to find a job that paid extremely  well. Growing up as a poor kid from the wrong side of town, I would have never imagined having the level of income that I now possessed. As I had completely shut off all of my old friends, I started making new friends and building a new life. It seemed like life was going well.

One night, my mother called me and told me that I should go to the hospital. My dad had suffered a heart attack and the doctors weren't expecting him to make it. When I arrived at the hospital, my mother met me outside of my dad's room. She told me that he was resting and he was not cognizant.  Although they had divorced, over the years they had become friends again.

She left me alone as I sat by the bed my father laid in unconscious.  I cried like a child as I told him everything that I had ever wanted to say. I knew that he couldn't hear me but I felt like I needed to empty out everything that I been carrying.  Although my dad was always good for a funny joke, we had always been terrible at communicating with each other. Finally, a nurse came in to tell me that visiting hours were over. 

When I left, I felt numb. I wanted to feel something,  anything. It seemed like I was always alone and I just wanted to feel alive. As I drove down the road with my window down enjoying the cool air, I heard ""Pride and Joy"" being played at a little Cajun restaurant. I pulled into the parking lot and got out to find myself a table. I have became accustomed to eating by myself over the years. 

I found a small two-seat table and I started to enjoy the show. It was a band that played a variety of music. Country, blues, zydeco , and other genres filled the night air. A little girl danced around in front of the stage waving a plastic Star Wars light saber. Her energy made me laugh as she bounced around wildly. 

After having a few beers, I had to visit the restroom. As I returned to my table, I saw an absolutely beautiful woman staring at me. She didn't look away as I walked towards her and slightly past her, my own table. As I approached her, she continued to hold my gaze. It was almost unnerving.  

""Good evening ma'am "", it was definitely not some smooth pickup line meant to instantly pull her in. ""Good evening Paul"", she replied as she registered the confusion on my face.  ""We know each other?"", I asked her. She laughed and replied, "" You knew me as a little girl. You were six years older than me so I'm sure you never noticed your friends little sister."" I laughed wryly, "" I have few friends so you are going to have to be specific. I'm certain you have changed dramatically since the last time we saw each other.""

""Justin is my older brother. You stepped in to rescue him when he was getting jumped in a Walmart parking lot."" I nodded and replied, ""He was a good kid, I hope that he is doing well.""
She laughed and told me that I wouldn't recognize him. He had went from 160 pounds to almost three hundred pounds. I laughed, ""If I keep eating these fried snicker bars, we both might be in the same boat"". She laughed warmly and asked if I would like to join her and her daughter at her table. She gestured to the energetic little girl still dancing waving the light saber. 

I moved over to her table and I had no clue that the beautiful woman sitting across from me would become my wife. My dad did recover from the heart attack but he passed away almost a year later. He absolutely loved my stepdaughter and they spent many hours fishing off my pier. I think he found peace as well before he passed.

Tonight, I think about the little events that eventually become major events before you even know it. Minutes turn into years and suddenly, you aren't a nineteen year old kid staring blankly into a mirror as it seems like everything you ever cared about falls apart. You are a grown man with a beautiful wife and a house full of kids laughter. God, thank you for the good days and the bad days.",1,1769781948.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1qr6ce7,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1qr6ce7/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1qr6bit,https://i.redd.it/es3xy920uhgg1.jpeg,Why a Winter Beach Trip to Gulf Shores & Orange Beach Is Underrated (in a Good Way),"Winter beach trips don’t get much hype, which is honestly part of the appeal. While most people mentally pack up beach season after summer, the Alabama coast settles into a slower, quieter rhythm that’s hard to beat.

In **Gulf Shores** and **Orange Beach**, winter feels less like an off-season and more like the coast catching its breath.

**What feels different about winter here**

Everything slows down — in the best way. Beaches feel open and calm, restaurants are easier to get into, and the whole area feels more personal. You’re not competing for parking, space, or reservations, and that alone changes the tone of a trip.

**Space to actually enjoy the beach**  
Winter beaches are made for long walks, shell hunting, sitting near the water with coffee, or just watching the waves without distractions. It’s quiet without feeling empty.

**Mild weather that’s great for being outside**  
You won’t get summer heat, but you also won’t be stuck indoors. Winter temps are usually comfortable enough for biking, walking trails, balcony mornings, and exploring without feeling drained.

**Better value, less pressure**  
Rates tend to be lower, and availability is better, which makes longer stays or last-minute trips way easier to pull off. You can be flexible without feeling like you’re cutting corners.

**A quieter kind of coastal beauty**  
Winter light is softer, sunsets feel bigger, and wildlife sightings are more common. Dolphins pop up offshore, seabirds gather along the sand, and the shoreline feels more natural and less “busy.”

**It’s easier to actually unwind**  
Without peak-season energy, the days feel unstructured in a good way. There’s no rush to cram everything in, and you leave feeling rested instead of needing another vacation to recover.

If you’ve ever thought about a beach trip that’s more about calm, space, and easy days than crowds and schedules, winter on the Gulf Coast is worth a look.

Last month, I was taking a walk in a park and noticed a girl. I almost fell for her at first sight. I really wanted to get to know her, but I hadn’t been in a relationship for a very, very long time, to the point that I honestly had no idea what I was supposed to do. In the end, I didn’t have the courage to go up and talk to her. That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about her. Over the next several days, I kept going back to that park, hoping I might run into her again—but unfortunately, I never did. Now I really regret it.

So what should I do in a situation like this?
Should I just walk up and ask for her number directly? I’m a complete stranger—wouldn’t that make rejection very likely? It also feels very goal-oriented, and I don’t really like that approach. Would it be better to ask if I could buy her a cup of coffee, get a basic sense of each other through conversation, and then ask for her contact information afterward? Or is that too old-fashioned? What if she’s busy and doesn’t have time?

And honestly, I don’t even know what to talk about. I feel like I don’t have any good topics. Just directly asking what she likes, what she studied in college, or what her job is feels really awkward. Or what if I try to talk about something, but she’s just not interested in me at all?

I am very much a people pleaser so these boundaries are always crossed with by my dad’s side of the family. 

Growing up my father was not present, he left my mum as a single parent and provided no help. He was in jail when I was first born. And then went to jail again when I was around 7 I believe, he went to jail for about 6 years. I think I went to visit him around 2 times when he was in prison, I did not enjoy visiting, in fact one of the times I was actually sick in the car on the way to see him from nerves. Obviously I felt quite uncomfortable round him because he was just this person that I didn’t know. But he would make it seem like Im just his “little girl”. 

Anyway, fast forward to him getting out of jail. My nanny brought me up to see him for the first time and asked me to write down a list of questions, I didn’t really understand why I was doing this but I just did , I was around 12 or 13 at the time. And again when I saw him I felt very uncomfortable he said how I wasn’t “daddy’s little girl anymore” ( never was ) and tbh I just wanted to go home. But I was kind of led on by my nanny and aunties to have this forced relationship with him. 

A couple years go by and we are kind of in contact, maybe go for the odd coffee etc and my brother (23M) would regularly go to football with him. My dad decided after the police lifted his travel ban that we should go on a holiday together for 2 weeks. (Bad idea) so we went to Portugal. You can imagine how this went. My dad hadn’t spent more than 2 hours with me since I was a child. I am now a hormonal teenager that he does not know very well. The holiday starts off with I’m stressing looking for his vape shouting the airport down. Then once we got there everything shit hit the fan. He constantly told me I needed to “smile more” and how ungrateful I was after he just spent XX amount of money. To be honest my brother and dad had a better relationship so they would kind of gang up on me in a sense and I really just missed my mum. 

So while we were on this holiday my brother meets a girl, I meet a friend. Alls going good, we’re enjoying the time with the people we met. My dad started to disappear and not come back until late and would sleep during the day. Me and my brother ended up having to pay for our own dinner most nights or go out with the people we meet ( they felt extremely sorry for us ) my brother and dad almost get into a fist fight one night as my brother comes home a little bit tipsy and starts calling the girl my brother was with a tramp etc. I get involved and he ends up taking my phone off me and throwing it into the safe and locking it there for the night. Keep in mind my mum wanted constant updates as she was so worried about us going on the holiday in the first place. I forgot to mention my dad was out drinking most nights and he was supposed to be a recovering alcoholic. I got the bill to our room to take a picture of it so he couldn’t deny it and I sent it to my auntie (his sister) she ended up ringing him one of the nights we were out with my friend I had met and her family. He starts calling me names at the table, I can’t really remember that he said tbh. 

So after all this commotion I get my phone back and ring my mum asap, my mum and auntie are desperately trying to book flights to come over and get us but I was like we only have a couple days left we may aswell just stay. We spent most of the time with the friends we met anyway while my dad drank. Anyway we come home from Portugal, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a more relived look on my mums face and we go home. 

From then me and my dad never had a relationship. I did not contact him, he did not contact me. He would send the odd message to say happy birthday, happy Christmas. And would still give me a card for my birthday. We literally just never spoke again. He asked me for coffee one time and I just sent him a big paragraph basically explaining that I didn’t want any sortve relationship with him. 

My brother maintained his relationship with my dad as they share a mutual interest in football, my brother is civil with him but says he will never forgive him. Fast forward to my 20’s - after not seeing him for many years, I’m blindsided when it comes to Christmas night of 2025. 

For Christmas we all go to my aunties house. Me and my brother go down together. My brother moved to Australia so it was just me this year. I go to my aunties and what do you know - my dad is there. This isn’t unusual but usually he would be gone by the time I come down ( this was always a thing ) but this time no one informed me that he was still there. WITH HIS NEW FAMILY. he has a new girlfriend and 2 little girls. I go into the house very awkwardly and give him like a side hug, he keeps trying to have the craic with me and act like everything’s okay?? Like brother I haven’t seen you in years what the fuck is going on. I see him with his 2 little girls and he seems like the best dad ever. He’s so attentive and gentle. It makes me so emotional as that was all I wanted growing up - a dad who was there. I ring my mum and she tells me to leave if I feel uncomfortable and I was like I’ve traveled the whole way down here I’ll just be civil. So I did that. I watched him be the father to his 2 little girls he could never be to me. 

The other day my auntie rang me and asked if I would go to his birthday dinner which confuses me immensely. Why the fuck would I want to go there? I said no, I was working (which was a lie) plus the added fact that my brother isn’t here so why would I go by myself when I have no relationship with my dad. Then she sends me a message saying they are doing some sortve project for my dad where they are getting people from our family / his friends / church people to write things they love about him and his new girlfriend asked me if I would write something. I let out a chuckle and wrote back “to be honest it would feel very fake and performative if I were to write something” she hearted the message and that was all good. My brothers girlfriend sent me a screenshot of all the stuff that was being written about him and it’s just so funny to read. 

My cousins talking about how he’s “the best dad ever” and “always there for his kids” and “we love how much he cares about his kids” like I understand he’s turned a corner and realised from his mistakes possibly; but it’s just so hard to read that stuff knowing how hard it was for my mum raising 2 children by herself. And how hard it was for me not having a dad. My nanny (his mum) and my auntie (his sister) will always ask things like “would you not want a relationship with your dad” and “what if he died would you not feel guilty” tbh. I don’t have a dad. He doesn’t exist to me. I just want to be left alone.  How can I set a very clear boundary? Or should I try mend the relationship. Idk I’m 22 and I just think the time has well past. 

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks. ",1,1769781625.0,Advice,1,0.99,False

# Introduction

Mangwon Market has been around for over 50 years, but recently it’s been drawing a young crowd. The nearby Mangridan-gil café street and [Mangwon Hangang Park](https://koreatravel.guru/p/mangwon-hangang-park/) make it easy to turn a market visit into a full day out, and the street food here, especially the **dakgangjeong** (Bite-sized crispy fried chicken), keeps people coming back.

Must-tries include **dakgangjeong**, **torch-grilled marshmallow ice cream, fried chili peppers** and **croquettes**. You’ll also find tteokgalbi (grilled short rib patties), mung bean pancakes, tonkatsu, and traditional Korean liquor.

It’s emerging as an alternative to Gwangjang Market for international tourists, and you can pack food to enjoy a picnic at [Mangwon Hangang Park](https://koreatravel.guru/p/mangwon-hangang-park/) just like locals.

okay so I used to be the person who'd spend 3 hours analyzing a text before hitting send. I'd replay conversations in my head like a broken record, dissecting every word, every pause, every facial expression. turns out 73% of people aged 25 35 are chronic overthinkers (according to a 2023 Cleveland Clinic study), so if you're reading this... you're probably one of us.

I went down a rabbit hole researching this, podcasts, books, psychology papers, youtube deep dives, because I was tired of my brain holding me hostage. Found Jay Shetty's approach particularly helpful, along with some neuroscience research that explains WHY this stuff works.

here's what actually helps:

**the 2 minute brain dump rule**

when you catch yourself spiraling, grab your phone notes or a piece of paper. set a timer for exactly 2 minutes. write down EVERY anxious thought without filtering. literally everything.  did I sound stupid in that meeting?   why hasn't she texted back?   am I wasting my life?  whatever's looping in your brain.

the magic happens after the timer goes off. your brain basically does a hard reset because you've externalized the thoughts. they're not bouncing around your skull anymore, they're on paper. a 2021 study from UCLA showed that labeling emotions and thoughts reduces activity in the amygdala (your brain's panic button) by up to 50%. 

I tried this during a particularly rough week at work and honestly... felt like someone turned down the volume in my head. it's weirdly effective.

**the  third person  perspective shift**

when you're overthinking a situation, ask yourself  what would I tell my best friend if they came to me with this problem?  

suddenly you become rational again. it's called  psychological distancing  and researchers at University of Michigan found it literally changes your brain activity. when you think in third person ( why is [your name] worried about this? ), you activate different neural pathways than when you think in first person. less emotional reactivity, more problem solving.

**the  future self  reality check**

Jay Shetty mentions this and it hits different. ask yourself: will this matter in 5 years? 5 months? 5 weeks? sometimes even 5 days?

most of the stuff we overthink is completely irrelevant within days. that embarrassing thing you said? nobody remembers. that text you're analyzing? they probably sent it while taking a shit and didn't think twice.

**resources that actually helped:**

** Think Like a Monk  by Jay Shetty**   yeah I know everyone's talking about this book but there's a reason. Shetty spent 3 years as a monk before becoming one of the most followed purpose coaches. won the Nautilus Book Award. the chapters on  letting go  and  negativity  are insanely good reads. he breaks down ancient wisdom into practical exercises that don't feel preachy or unrealistic. this book will make you question everything you think you know about your thought patterns. best self help book I've read in years, genuinely changed how I process anxiety.

also mentions the  Monk Mindset  podcast by Shetty, his interview with Dr. Daniel Amen (brain imaging specialist) about overthinking and anxiety is worth the listen.

**BeFreed**   this is an AI learning app that turns psychology research, expert interviews, and books into personalized audio content. When I wanted to go deeper into the science of overthinking without reading another 300 page book, I just typed in  stop overthinking and build mental clarity  and it generated a custom podcast pulling from multiple sources, cognitive behavioral therapy research, neuroscience papers, even real stories from people who've dealt with similar patterns. 

The depth control is clutch. You can get a 10 minute overview or switch to a 40 minute deep dive with actual examples and techniques when something clicks. I went with the smoky voice option because it made the heavier psychology concepts easier to absorb during my commute. It also builds an adaptive learning plan based on your specific struggles, so if you're dealing with social anxiety versus work stress, it tailors everything accordingly. Made by former Google engineers and Columbia grads, so the content quality is solid and science backed.

**Finch app**   this self care app has a  worry tree  feature that guides you through cognitive behavioral therapy exercises when you're spiraling. it's like having a tiny therapist in your pocket. the journaling prompts are specifically designed to interrupt rumination cycles. costs like $5/month for premium but the free version does plenty.

**Dr. K's HealthyGamer youtube channel**   he's a Harvard psychiatrist who explains the neuroscience behind overthinking in super accessible ways. his video on  why your brain won't shut up  has 2M views for good reason. breaks down the default mode network (the part of your brain that overthinks) and gives concrete tools to regulate it.

**here's the thing nobody tells you:**

overthinking isn't actually about the situation you're obsessing over. it's usually about control. your brain thinks if it analyzes something enough, it can prevent bad outcomes or make  perfect  decisions. but that's not how life works. 

research from the National Science Foundation found that 85% of what we worry about never happens. and for the 15% that does happen? 79% of people reported they handled it better than expected or learned something valuable.

your brain is trying to protect you but it's using outdated software. back when we were cavemen, overanalyzing whether that rustling bush was a predator kept us alive. now it just keeps us up at 3am wondering if our coworker's  sounds good!  text was passive aggressive.

the goal isn't to stop thinking. it's to stop the thoughts from running the show. treat your anxious thoughts like background music at a coffee shop, they're there, you notice them, but you don't need to stop everything and focus on them.

try the 2 minute rule next time you spiral. worst case scenario, you waste 2 minutes. best case? you give your brain the circuit breaker it desperately needs.",1,1769781451.0,ArtOfPresence,0,1.0,False

Picture this: it's Friday, almost 11 PM, and I'm just trying to push a *tiny* update to a client's website. Nothing major, just some text tweaks. I hit save, refresh the staging site, and BAM! The entire layout, which was perfectly fine an hour ago, is just... *gone*. Like, divs flying everywhere, text overlapping, images stretched into abstract art. Pure, unadulterated chaos.

My heart did that sickening lurch you get when you know you've just broken something big. I immediately thought, 'Oh god, I must have deleted a whole CSS file, or somehow hosed the main JavaScript bundle.' I spent the next three hours, fuelled by increasingly cold coffee and sheer desperation, tearing through every single line of code. I checked responsive breakpoints, scrutinized Flexbox properties, even ran a linter thinking maybe some hidden syntax error was nuking the whole thing. The fluorescent glow of my monitor was mocking me, my fingers flying across the keyboard in a frantic, pointless dance.

I was legit about to throw my keyboard out the window. My eyes were blurry, my head was pounding, and I was contemplating a new career as a professional moss collector. Then, in a final, Hail Mary pass, I decided to just *slowly* reread the tiny little CSS file I had touched. And there it was. Staring back at me, mocking my three hours of frantic debugging: a single, solitary missing semicolon. A property, `display: flex`, was followed immediately by `align-items: center` without the `;` in between. That's it. That was the atomic bomb that annihilated my beautiful layout.

The wave of relief that washed over me was quickly followed by an even bigger wave of self-loathing. All that time, all that panic, all for a semicolon! I fixed it, the layout snapped back into perfection, and I just sat there, staring blankly at the screen. It's the kind of dumb mistake that makes you question your entire existence as a developer.

I started October at 208 pounds. 

Coming into February I'm gonna be around 164-166.

I'm proud of the weight I've lost but I'm still far from where I want to be. My goal weight is around 140-145. 

I have a lot of experience with fasting. In fact in the beginning of my journey I even went an entire week without eating. 

So I was wondering if for the final 20 pounds it's okay if I eat very little (like literally just black coffee and one serving of scrambled eggs with bread every day) until I hit the goal. 

I finally have some real autonomy over my life as I'm currently moving out of my parents home. 

My whole life, although I take a lot of blame too, I blame my parents for raising me to be ingrained with such a terrible diet. Which is why basically me and my whole family has been overweight or obese our entire lives. 

I spent the last 22 years obese, and I want to be done with that chapter of my life asap. It has costed me so much emotional baggage, because I constantly felt I was never good enough or just ""ugly"". But I'm not ugly, and neither are most people. We are just out of shape. 

Good news is I'm only around 20 pounds away. 20 pounds away from finally being seen as having a ""good"" physique.

1qr64if,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenCanadaPolitics/comments/1qr64if/trump_threatens_to_decertify_bombardier_over/,Trump Threatens to Decertify Bombardier Over Gulfstream Delay,"President Trump yesterday accused Canada with fact free statements of seeking to keep the Gulfstream 500, 600, 700, and 800 series jets out of the Canadian market. The jets were certified by the FAA and EU last April.

Information has been light, but Transport Canada has approved many jets from Gulfstream including 200,300,400, 550 series.

Canada has stricter standards in cold soak testing and braking than the FAA, which may mean that aircraft manufacturers have to pass additional compliance prior to being certified for Canada.

The main sticking point appears to the be that Gulfstream may not have passed all cold weather tests necessary to certify the jets for the Canadian market.

Canada is generally a lot colder than the US. Having stricter cold weather standards is neither exceptional nor out of the ordinary.

President Trump in his claims never backed up the statements with any proof. He simply stated (or implied) as if it is a matter of fact that Canada was deliberately delaying the certification to keep Gulfstream out of the market.

It should be noted that Bombardier's Global 8000 series has significant American inputs including wings, engines, and avionics made in factories across the US.

This brings us to the question whether Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and the Liberal Party's ill advised antagonism of President Trump serves Canada's interests.

Is there a relationship between this latest threat to Quebec and Ontario aviation industries, because Carney is wooing China? Furthermore, the WEF speech last week seems to coincide with this new salvo on the part of Trump. Could be a coincidence or it could be that Carney is getting unnecessarily at loggerheads with Trump.

Were Carney getting the business done and piping up less, Canada's interests would be better served, in our view. Unfortunately, the opposite is happening. There is more bluster and bravado, with comparatively meagre results on the part of the Liberals.

Let's remember Carney and the Liberals have had 10+ years. This is not a new government. And they have wasted another year, including 6 months proroguing parliament.

As soon as Conservatives wake up and smell the coffee that they need to go to an open contest, not just use paywalls to install and entrench the same political caste, the Conservative Party could breathe new life into their prospects.

We have reason to believe, Canadians are wearied of the Liberals and are increasingly hoping for a viable alternative that can get results on the economy.",1,1769781382.0,OpenCanadaPolitics,0,1.0,False
1qr6417,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseHarem/comments/1qr6417/the_angst_bank_omegaverse_a_list_of_angsty_novels/,"The Angst Bank - Omegaverse - A list of angsty novels, with angst and grovel scale","# Last updated: 01/31/26

This is the revamped version of The Angst Bank, separated by genre. This list is just Omegaverse. There are two other comprehensive lists, a simplified list and a list for books that didn't make the cut:

* [The Angst Bank: Fantasy & Urban Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseHarem/comments/1qr63wc/the_angst_bank_fantasy_urban_fantasy_a_list_of/)
* [The Angst Bank: Everything Else](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseHarem/comments/1qr63tg/the_angst_bank_everything_else_a_list_of_angsty/)
* [The Angst Bank: Simplified](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseHarem/comments/1qr63p8/the_angst_bank_simplified_a_list_of_angsty_novels/)
* [The Angst Bank: The Cutting Room Floor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseHarem/comments/1pfabmj/the_angst_bank_cutting_room_floor/)

Both angst and grovel scales have been hammered out to be a little more coherent (I used a tier-maker so I could see titles side-by-side and actually make better judgments). The grovel scale has also switched from a numbered scale to a descriptive one. I have also switched up the ranking to better reflect what I think the best angsty novels are. That said, some of these titles were read quite a while ago and ratings may be a little bit off for those compared to others and future books.

You can follow this post to get notified when I add to the list (assuming Reddit cooperates). I reply with the titles added when updating the list.

========================================================

========================================================

# Scales & Information:

* An asterisk (\*) means I haven't finished what is available of the series and am ranking the first book only.
* As a side-note, just because a book has a low angst rating doesn't mean it isn't fairly angsty. It may just have low angst compared to other books on the list.
* ***Angst scoring:*** For the angst scale, I put a lot of emphasis on how the FMC *feels*. For me, angst requires the FMC to feel hurt. Terrible things may happen, but if the FMC shrugs them off or feels anger rather than hurt, the angst rating goes down.
   * For trilogies and series, this rating is more difficult as the angst may vary wildly. So, I've chosen to go with how angsty the series felt overall. Big spikes in one book may drive that up, but the scale doesn't accurately reflect maximum angst.
      * Example: Her Vicious Beasts hits level 10 for the entirety of book four, but the overall series is rated a six.
* ***Angst scale is followed by the cause.*** 'Dark world' usually means the in-book world is discriminatory towards an MC. Sexual abuse can include rape, but not attempted rape. And all tags are regarding the MCs and **only** if they actually caused angst. You'd still want to pay attention to content warnings and/or trigger tags elsewhere.
* ***Connected vs disconnected series:*** Connected means the books shares a plot and/or non-main characters with other books. Disconnected means there are no shared characters or plot. If it just says ""series,"" then I do not know how connected other books are.
* ***Mean vs cruel:*** ""mean MMCs"" means that the cruelty isn't too severe, or is accidental. ""Cruel MMCs"" means it's vicious and intentional.
* ***MMC vs MMCs:*** This isn't a typo.

**Grovel scale** (these ratings do not mean the book has heavy grovel, merely how well the grovel fit the fuck-up):

* **Overboard**: This can be because the fuck-up was minor but paired with a massive grovel, or because it was actually overboard (lengthy, lots of big gestures, etc), or because the FMC was stubborn and didn't want to forgive them.
* **Fantastic**: This is the perfect or near-perfect amount and, often, *kind* of grovel. MMCs that really get the FMC and grovel the right way are in this category. Can include minor fuck-ups that didn't need much grovel.
* **Really good**: MMCs that try pretty hard to fix what they've broken and correct themselves.
* **Good**: Solid grovel.
* **Alright**: The MMCs did what was needed and I'm okay with it.
* **Just adequate**: They're forgiven, but it's slightly grudgingly so.
* **Needs just a little more**: The MMCs almost had it.
* **Needs way more**: The MMCs got their forgiveness but didn't really have to work for it.
* **Barely any**: Sometimes an apology is fine.. I guess?
* **Actively crummy**: At least one MMC still needs to be punched in the nuts, repeatedly.
* **Non-existent**: No grovel.
* **N/A**: Not applicable, no grovel was needed.
* **UF**: Either the series is unfinished, or I haven't finished reading it and can't say what the grovel is

# Omegaverse

**Recommended angsty reads and in order of how good much I liked them (YMMV):**

* **{Bittersweet Bonds by Livi Weston}** \- *OV - MFMMM - Trilogy (book #3 is not out yet)* \- FMC has her heart and sanity shattered when the boys she's in love with bond with her friend. I love this one because the FMC goes from being a normal teenage girl to an adult woman willing to use violence to enforce her boundaries and get justice/revenge. It also flips the script on the common OV plot of 'damsels in distress.'
   * ***Angst: 9, OW-drama/rejection/dark themes/sexual abuse (past, not of FMC)***
   * ***Grovel: Fantastic (but barely needed)***
* **{Pack Darling by Lola Rock}** \- *OV - MMFMMM - Duet in a disconnected series* \- FMC is an omega that is forced to join a pre-existing pack. Said pack already has a male omega and didn't want another. But, it turns out they're her scent match.
   * ***Angst: 9, rejection/rough childhood/dark world***
   * ***Grovel: Overboard***
* **{A Blissful Omegaverse by Kate King & Jessa Wilder}** \- *OV - MMMMF - Duet with a novella pre-quel* \- FMC unexpectedly presents as an omega as a teenager. Her close friends/not-quite-boyfriends reject her and call for the government organization for omegas to come collect her because they don't think they can keep her safe. I happen to love this one. The MMCs know they fucked up and feel pretty terrible about it.
   * ***Angst: 4, rejection/dark world***
   * ***Grovel: Fantastic***
* **{The Bonding Trials by Evelyn Flood}** \- *OV - MMFMM - Duet* \- Alphas and omegas are matched by government organization. The FMC goes to the event where she's to meet her matches, only to have them kiss another woman after greeting her. Massive OW drama.
   * ***Angst: 10, OW-drama/rejection/little bit of a dark world***
   * ***Grovel: Overboard***
* **{Heat Hesitation by Birdie D'Avo}** \- *OV - MFMMM - Stand-alone in a loosely connected series* \- MMCs are a bunch of rich boys that stop when they see a girl on a bridge, looking as though she was going to jump. One of them gets close enough to realize she's their scent-matched omega before she falls into the river and is never recovered. A year (or a few years?) later, they find out she isn't dead. This is a feminist-leaning OV and I freakin' love it.
   * ***Angst: 2, mean MMC/dark world/grief***
   * ***Grovel: Fantastic***
* **{Knot Her Catch by Ari Wright}** \- *OV - MFMMM - Stand-alone in a very loosely connected series (can be read out of order)* \- The angst is all internal. The FMC was told by her family that her scent is rancid. They also heaped loads of body shame onto her. So she believes no alpha could possibly want her. The FMC is still confident and talks back to people; she just doesn't think she's desirable.
   * ***Angst: 2, body and scent shame***
   * ***Grovel: 5***
* **{Redfang Royal by Lola Rock}** \- *OV - MMFMM - Stand-alone in a disconnected series* \- FMC is a delta and able to kill with her terrible scent. Meets her scent matches while wearing her sister's scent but believes they have matched to her sister, not her.
   * ***Angst: 3, exploitation (by government organization)/shame***
   * ***Grovel: N/A***
* **{Knot the One They Want by Harper Lennox}** \- *OV - MFMMM - Stand-alone in a disconnected series* \- MCs are pushed together by their rich families. They discover they're scent matches but the MMCs don't want a bond. They want to win back the omega that left them. But because of rich people problems, a bond is forced and the MMCs are still massive dicks about the whole thing.
   * ***Angst: 8, rejection/cruel MMCs***
   * ***Grovel: Alright***
* [**{Rescuing Phoenix by M.J. Byrne}**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseHarem/comments/1pfafdv/angst_bank_additions_12525_notable_rescuing/) *- OV - MFMM - Stand-alone in a loosely connected series* \- FMC works for a PR firm while pretending to be a beta. She is also a recovering alcoholic. When her boss sends her on tour with three rowdy rockstars to clean up their bad boy PR scandals, she discovers they're her scent matches. But they don't know and they don't want her around.
   * ***Angst: 7, mean MMCs/mild bullying/rejection/substance abuse struggle***
   * ***Grovel: Fantastic***
* **{Shattered Omega by Marie Mackay}** \- *OV - MFMM - Trilogy in a very loosely connected series + shared universe* \- FMC is a gold-pack omega at a university and has found her scent matches. Unfortunately, another alpha decides he wants her and blackmails her into becoming his pack's omega. Dub-con and one of the MMCs is kinda mean but not in a way I'd call bullying because he's pretty open about being gone for her.
   * ***Angst: 3, mean MMC/dark world***
   * ***Grovel: Non-existent***
* **{All These Broken Parts by Evelyn Flood}** \- *OV - MFMMM (I think) - Duet* \- FMC kills an alpha that was part of a pack she was close to bonding with. He was brothers with one of the pack members. They're angry and want both answers and vengeance.
   * ***Angst: 10, sexual abuse (past)/trauma/cruel MMCs***
   * ***Grovel: Overboard***
* **{Pack Gamble by Hannah Haze}** \- *OV - MFMMMM - Duet in a disconnected series* \- FMC has a 'got drunk in Vegas, woke up married' kind of night. Except instead of married, it's a pack bond. The stranger is a rich, famous guy that she doesn't recognize. He takes her home and then he and his pack fall for her. Of course, this is a duet, so some shit goes down and a grovel becomes necessary.
   * ***Angst: 3, rejection***
   * ***Grovel: Really good***
* **{House of Omega by Roxy Collins}** \- OV - MMMMFM - Stand-alone in a connected series - FMC wants a job with the fashion icon company, House of Omega. She's a beta with an abusive and possessive stepbrother that intends to force her into a pack bond. On the way to the interview, she meets a male omega headed for his own interview and they immediately click. But rather than a job, the omega ends up in a courtship by the company's pack owners, bringing her with him.
   * ***Angst: 2, rejection, abuse (past)***
   * ***Grovel: Fantastic (barely needed)***
* **{Knot Forgotten by AJ Moran}** \- *OV - MFMMM - Stand-alone in a loosely connected series* \- FMC was in love with four boys as a teenager but abruptly moved away. Meets them again when she starts university and they resent the fuck outta her.
   * ***Angst: 4, cruel MMCs/rejection***

The rest of his pack arrives and, under the laws in this universe, take custody of her and punish her.
   * ***Angst: 7, abuse (past)/sexual abuse (past)/trauma/cruel MMCs/very dark world***
   * ***Grovel: Needs a little bit more***
* **{Ruined Alphas by Amy Nova}** \- *OV - MMMMF (it's really more MMFMM until the very end) - Stand-alone in a shared universe* \- FMC is an omega in a cult-like terrorist organization bent on eliminating alphas and omegas. She's been controlled, conditioned and abused since she was a teenager. The MMCs are law enforcement actively hunting her terrorist identity. And the MMCs, save one, don't want an omega.
   * ***Angst: 5, abuse (past and current)/sexual abuse (past and current)/trauma/mild rejection/dark world***
   * ***Grovel: Alright***
* **{Knot Unwanted by Tessa Rain}** \- *OV - MMMMF - Duet* \- FMC has been at ""academy"" for years, being trained to be the perfect, subservient omega. While she's being transported to her new owner, there's an accident and she escapes. Ends up on the property of a pack that already has a male omega.
   * ***Angst: 5, abuse (past)/trauma/exploitation***
   * ***Grovel: ?***
* [**{Brandy Snap by Abby Hunter}**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseHarem/comments/1pv1vxj/i_need_to_talk_about_brandy_snap_a_wellwritten/) *- OV - MMMF - Ongoing four-book series in a larger disconnected series* \- FMC is a cleaner at an establishment that offers heat suites and sex workers. Upon entering what was supposed to be an empty room, she finds an omega and his two alphas in the midst of the omega's heat. They're her scent matches and trigger her emergence as an omega. They want her, sexually, but also hate her because they don't want another omega.

   * ***Angst:*** **5, rejection/stupid MMCs/OW-drama (MMCs are not at fault for this one, the FMC is)**
   * ***Grovel: Needs just a little more***
* **{Hopeless Omega by Ember Nicole}** *- OV - MFMM - Stand-alone in a connected series* \- FMC discovers her scent matches at a mating event. Everything seems fine until the morning after they bring her home, when they refuse to have anything to do with her and won't explain why. After a year of being treated like garbage, she jumps at the chance to break their bonds and leave.
   * ***Angst: 7, rejection/bullying/cruel MMCs/verbal abuse***
   * ***Grovel: Fantastic***
* **{Sweetheart by Marie Mackay}** *- OV - MFMMM - Duet in a shared world* \- FMC finds her scent match in the form of a famous pack of actors, but she's a gold omega and destined to be rejected by more respectable packs. After a short-sighted internet post, she's kidnapped, dark bonded by vicious pack and forced to show up on her mates' doorstep as a Beta Sweetheart, hiding her true identity and her purpose.

* **{Saving the Pack's Omega by Callie Clark}** \- *OV - MMFMM - Stand-alone in a loosely connected series* \- FMC has been kept isolated by her parents and sold one alpha and to betas during her heats (meaning she experiences nothing but pain since betas can't help omegas that way).

   * ***Angst: 5, sexual abuse (past and current)/abuse (past)/trauma/cruel MMC/partial rejection/dark world***

* **{Claim & Don't Tell by Rory Miles}** *- OV - MFMM - Stand-alone in a connected series* \- FMC has known her step-brothers were her scent matches since she first met them.

   * ***Grovel: Really good***
* **{The Primordial Covenant by J.C. Belenac}** *- OV - MMMMF - Duet* \- The FMC has been in hiding, under a new identity, for years thanks to her rabidly anti-designation family. If she's found, being killed would be a mercy.

After getting a job as a band photographer, she finds herself drawn to the band members.

   * ***Grovel: Really good***
* **{Knot Her Shot by Ari Wright}** *- OV - MFMM (ish) - Stand-alone in a loosely connected series -* FMC's friend sets her up with a matching service that promises to find her a pack.

   * ***Grovel: Good***
* **{Knot Here for You by Tana Rose}** \- *OV - MMFMMM - Stand-alone in a connected loosely connected series* \- FMC is in love with a pack when they announce they are bonding to another omega. OW drama is really more miscommunications/fuck-ups than full-blown OW drama.

* **{Knot All is Perfect by Holly Monroe}** \- *OV - MMFMMM - Stand-alone in a loosely connected series* \- FMC was genetically designed to be the perfect omega.

* **{The Beta by Avanne Michaels}** \- *OV - MMMMMF that becomes MMMMMMMFM - Trilogy* \- FMC is a beta and what is probably going to be her last placement is with a pack that has a male omega and doesn't want her. This one is a bit odd because the FMC goes through a lot of really bad shit (gang-rape, mostly off-page) but shrugs most of it off. (And some of the MMCs don't take it seriously either, so they can eat a dick.)
   * ***Angst: 6, sexual abuse (past and present)/abuse (present)/trauma/rejection/dark world***

* **{Knot Happening Again by Harper Lennox}** \- *OV - MFMMMM - Stand-alone in a disconnected series* \- FMC was half-bonded by an alpha when she was young.

   * ***Angst: 1, rejection/stalking***
   * ***Grovel: 6 (only slightly needed)***
   * *Issue:* It was just okay.
* **{Omega Found by Evelyn Flood}** *- OV - MFMMM - Stand-alone in a connected series* \- The FMC, an omega and property of the government, is being put through a new, brutal (abusive) training with a sadistic guard when she is given to a pack of alphas that believe all the government propaganda about omegas causing the Omega War. But it's better than being sent to the heat dens and having her children stolen.
   * ***Angst: 4, physical abuse (past & present)/sexual abuse (present)/trauma/mean MMCs/exploitation/dark world***
   * ***Grovel: ?***
   * *Issue:* Kind of meh.

* **{Knot Our Mistake by Sadie Monroe}** *- OV - MMMF - Stand-alone in a disconnected series* \- The FMC is an omega that was sent back to Omega Industries by her first pack almost immediately. This puts her into a category where she gets one more chance at a pack. However, when she arrives at her new pack's home, they immediately reject her, claiming they didn't order an omega.
   * ***Angst: 2, rejection***
   * ***Grovel: ?***
   * *Issue:* It was just okay
* **{Sing Omega Sing by Bella Donna}** *- OV - MFMM - Stand-alone in a disconnected series* \- FMC is homeless, singing on street corners when the Alpha owner of a music company hears her sing.

Obviously the goal is FIRE.

The other goals are to get into real estate, land-lording, airbnb-ing, house hacking as early as possible. So potentially using my investment accounts early for downpayments etc.

I’m looking to lose 5kgs or so and keep it off. I’ve already lost a fair amount of weight so I know the basics of eat less/more high volume and protein and move more. I lift 3-4x per week, get in my protein and walk everyday. I’m pretty lean already but looking to drop those pesky pounds around my tummy. But anyway, my advice is regarding that I’m moving in with a rather judgemental friend who is gonna be my roommate for a year, i eat Whole Foods and don’t eat a whole lot of super “normal” foods like cheese/chips/chocolates. I still stock small portions of them but not often. I need ideas for low calorie snacks/sauces that are accidentally low cal. I’m also just planning to tell her that I’m on this meal plan because of my eczema, people tend to take the fact that you have allergies more seriously than if you’re trying to lose weight. She also likes to cook often and will offer food to me and ask to go for ice cream ( None of which I want often at all) Do you guys have any other suggestions I can use to hide the fact that I’m attempting to do a lifestyle change - I could really do without the judgement as it’s irritating and kinda mean! (I have no option to live anywhere else) I’m planning on stocking “accidentally” low cal stuff like pickles/lotsa veggies/popcorn/mustard/coffee/coke zero/ sparkling water and telling her I just enjoy these foods. but is there other foods I’m missing? Or does anyone have any advice on the best way to go about it (telling her I’m losing weight is NOT in the cards so please don’t suggest it - I’m WELL aware you should be able to tell “true friends” anything and have them respect it, fortunately I just have to go a year of this)  also do you guys have any advice just approaching this situation (maybe having the food she offers once in a while like an 80/20 sort of approach)",1,1769781141.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,1.0,False

I hope this letter finds you in the midst of some grand adventure, or at the very least, a particularly excellent cup of Tea or Coffee (whatever you like more, Ima Tea person btw). I wanted to express my admiration for you, just because you have the coolest notebook in class (I'm joking, I know you take notes in your laptop). Throughout that one course I shared with you, I found myself inexplicably drawn to your presence. Though we never exchanged words, your aura radiated a captivating warmth that left a persistent impression on my heart. Your elegance, how you walk and talk, It grabbed my attention in a way that's not easy to express in words. Your voice, it was a symphony. When you asked questions or answered questions, the room hushed, as if the universe leaned in to listen. Each word you spoke carried weight, as if it held the answers to life’s mysteries. I imagined conversations with you(the endless conversation). Your hands were a comfort. I watched them how they moved across the keyboard, ohh the graceful movements. They've written stories, drawn diagrams, maybe even held someone's hand(I'm jealous). I wondered if they knew their power to create, to touch lives. So here I am, writing this confession. Maybe you’ll never read it, and that’s okay. I hope this letter brings a smile to your face, or at the very least, a chuckle at my expense. If fate allows, if we meet again, I hope to find the courage to say HELLO. Until then, know that someone out there admires you.
A little note, I'm sorry that I am not using the available information(got your email adress from insti app) in the intended way but I couldn't hold myself in writing this(worte this few days ago) to you and I really hope that you don't get creeped out after reading this also I was wondering if you'd be comfortable sharing your Instagram handle with me(coz I want to make sure you really are the Kavya who I think Kavya is, I'm bad at stalking🤧). And by any chance if you've guessed who I'm, please forgive me for writing this(no particular reason). Thank you for taking out your time reading this

I’m looking for advice and shared experiences.

**Background:**

I used to weigh around 400 lbs. Over the last several years, I lost weight and reached 250 lbs in order to join the Army. The process took about seven years because I struggled with repeated crash dieting. I’m currently 217 lbs.

I’m actively working on my relationship with food and overall health. I see a dietitian monthly, attend therapy monthly, and participate in nutritional counseling weekly. One of my biggest challenges has been overcoming an all-or-nothing/perfectionist mindset around eating.

**Current routine:**

I try to listen to my body and keep my meals consistent. I eat three times a day:

\- After the gym: protein bar, banana, and coffee

\- Two other meals: half plate rice, one quarter vegetables, one quarter protein

Even with this structure, I still catch myself snacking randomly. I’m not bingeing and I don’t feel physically hungry — it’s more like I snack simply because food is available. My nutritional counselor/therapist say my brain is still in this scarcity mentality and looking for a quick dopamine hit. They have suggested I keep an emotions journal, puzzle, do pushups, a mantra when this comes up. 

**Questions:**

\- Has anyone else dealt with this after major weight loss or years of dieting?

\- What strategies helped you reduce mindless snacking?",3,1769780718.0,loseit,4,0.8,False

I (39F) have had iron deficiency anemia for many years, I ignored it for a long time which was silly. What makes it more complicated is that I had gastric bypass surgery 5 years ago and so now absorb even less iron. 

I have been taking 500% of my daily iron needs religiously for 3 months. I literally have not missed a day. I’ve been trying my best to take it away from tea/ coffee/ etc and never take it close to calcium. However my blood results have just come back and my ferretin has dropped further from 15 down to 10. 

I have previously had Monofer iron infusions, the first time went well with no issues. I returned a week later for the second (out of 2) and had a hypersensitivity reaction. However after some meds and waiting ones able to continue with the infusion. My iron was then great for almost a whole year and symptoms were so so much better!

I was sent for another infusion this year and had a more severe hypersensitivity reaction. It wasn’t anaphylaxis but it caused such a  jump in heart rate and so much sweating that they said it was not safe to give it to me and they would not agree to give it to me in future. 

I’m now at a bit of a loss, I have asked my GP for a referral to haematology but they seem reluctant and just don’t get back to me :( not sure what I can be trying.

1qr5s9u,https://i.redd.it/6iuu3jz3qhgg1.jpeg,Day 4,"Ahhh, whiskey and cigars, what else can you expect out of a writer to find joy in? It’s not my picture, my goal is to never use a picture of mine, and instead inquire from my friends and keep writing based on what they send me. So what can I say about whiskey and cigars? 



First the framing. I have to laugh, because I am picturing someone with a phone up near their face as they capture this moment. Their noggin squished against the viewfinder of their cellphone to get this blursed image. Furthermore, this isn’t some distinguished cigar bar, but rather a plain jane place it seems like. Not some luxurious establishment, as seen by the bag of chips, conduit for the power and rather simple high top seating for the patrons. 



There’s nothing wrong with plain jane, rather there is something remarkable about a simple picture like this. Not trying to say much, but saying so much in how little it’s trying to say. Which makes my job so much more difficult. There’s no aloof puff of smoke. No obvious swagger or mood lighting. No commentary about some luxurious cigar bar, but its simpleness is what keeps drawing my attention. 



Because simple says a lot. Simple is hard to do. Simple, as in it has everything you expect for a whiskey cigar bar. Two glasses of whiskey, water glasses, and a loud and obvious cigar holder/ash tray. 



Now the lack of company might say something, but that could always be given away by the fact that there is someone to the side of this gentleman, since there are two whiskey glasses. So alone he does not sit. 



He sits with company so that’s a plus since it’s wonderful to partake in whiskey and cigars with a comrade in arms.  



Now what to say about liquor and smoke of choice for a writer. It is cliche? Obvious? A road well traveled? Dull and mundane? I would say it is part of the famous quote from Hemmingway about writing drunk and editing sober. But this year is a sober year for me. So let’s see how long I stay sober for and how much it changes my life. 



So perhaps this is where I talk about my time with Alcoholics Anonymous. I’m not here to tell any of their stories. But I will say without a bit of hesitation that they are a group of wonderful people, full of purpose and life, especially the groups I visited. One group in particular was full of joy and showed true courageous spirit in fighting the fight they are part of. 



What isn’t surprising is how, golly, they work hard in keeping each other accountable while not trying to have the Messiah complex. They are willing to help if you reach out and that is key I think. I was given a list of so many names and numbers, and no pressure to call any of them. But I was given the resources to succeed, and I think that is something special. 



I can go on about how friendly and loving people they are, how much coffee I drank with them. How much I read their blue book, and all the magical stuff that is happening in their community. But I will save their story for a better picture. What I will say is this. 



If you are looking for help in dealing with the demons that is alcohol, know that their community is one where you will find solace, forgiveness, and ultimately the strength to get back up on your two feet. 



But to talk about whiskey in a more colloquial sense now, it is a poison that I know very intimately. It is something that I partook in quite a bit and don’t mind at all in expressing my joy in it when I was consuming it. 



It was great and would do again, same with the cigars. It truly made me feel like there was something, how to say it, intellectual going on. It truly sparked something in me, when I was smoking with some Catholics about the philosophy of belief and life. 



Though yes the Catholics were very much on the conversion train, they still were great jousting buddies in the short time I got to know them. And that was before the smoke got me talking and got me listening, in general, great people. 



And perhaps that is what I am trying to get at today. Is that great people and great company are not hard to come by, but quite hard to cultivate properly. Cultivate in a fun and powerful way that enriches your life. Because it is so easy to miss them, to not connect with them properly in the right setting and soon a great person is just a contact name in your phone, rather than a powerful connection. 



And to continue my perhaps, mayhaps that is part of the problem with today’s digital web I mentioned with the spider, linking the two photos together. This organic web I want to cultivate with others is being hindered by the digital means of disconnecting us. Because despite the power to call anyone at our finger tips, how often do we use that power to connect with people? How often do people stay alone and quiet and isolated versus using the great cell phone to connect with others? 



I am not here to judge. I am just a lowly redditor writer, with no renown, so my opinion doesn’t mean much. But I do wonder and the more I wonder, the more it feels like not just me, is it? Will someone answer me and go down that path of wondering if we truly are living a more connected life with all the digital accouterments? Does all the digital baggage really help us or does it hinder us? As well I oxymoronically ask this on a digital accouterment. So I understand I am asking this into the void, and especially asking this on what I consider a digital machine rather than a vital organ. But I’ll ask it anyway, do you think we are more connected with all the digital machines between us?

The night of my husband Jay's album victory, joy shattered-- betrayal stared back at me when I use his unlocked phone. 
I clicked on the video-- there stood Jay, beside a woman holding an infant.
The camera zoomed in, and my pulse kicked hard, sharp enough to hurt.
She was Jay's former backup singer.
""Say Dada,"" the woman whispered, ""Say it. Tell him we’re done being his dirty little secret while he plays house with his barren ice queen.""
Barren-- The word hit me like a physical blow.
My fingers curled around the edge of the counter as something inside her fractured quietly, efficiently.
He'd been comforting me while another woman carried his child.
I scrolled again.
An email.
Jay to his lawyer. Dated six months ago.
If Leone finds out, we spin it as a separation that already happened. Plant stories about her being difficult and controlling. The public will take my side. 
Something vital had gone numb.
I wasn't his wife. I was strategy.
I didn't cry. In that silence, rage coiled into purpose. 
I was thinking about how to deliver the fatal blow.
-------------
The celebration was still humming in the air, even after the lights had gone out.
Jay slept on his back, one arm flung carelessly across the sheets, his breathing slow and satisfied. The kind of sleep that came from triumph. From applause that hadn't yet faded. From knowing the world had bent, once again, in his direction.
Leone lay beside him, awake.
The room smelled like champagne and skin and something electric that hadn't fully discharged. Jay's latest album had gone triple platinum barely hours earlier. His fifth. The Grammy sat on the nightstand, catching the low amber glow from the lamp, polished and smug, like it knew it belonged there.
Leone stared at it longer than she should have.
She tried to remember when celebration had started feeling like performance. When joy became something she managed instead of felt. Her body was warm beneath the sheets, but there was a faint tightness in her chest she couldn't shake, a rhythm just slightly off.
Then the vibration came.
Soft. Insistent. Too deliberate to be accidental.
It pulsed against the mahogany of the nightstand, once, twice, three times, the sound cutting through the quiet like a metronome gone wrong.
Jay didn't stir.
Leone reached across his chest, careful not to wake him, her fingers brushing over his skin before closing around the phone. It was cool against her palm. Heavy. Familiar.
She expected congratulations. Industry praise. Another carefully worded message from someone important reminding Jay how untouchable he was.
Instead, the screen lit up with seventeen missed calls.
All from Marcus.
Her stomach tightened.
A new text appeared before she could overthink it.
She's threatening to go public. The money isn't working anymore. You need to see this. NOW.
Leone's thumb hovered, frozen.
A video file began downloading on its own.
Her pulse kicked hard, sharp enough to hurt.
She slipped out of bed, the sheets whispering against her skin. Jay shifted, muttered something unintelligible, then rolled onto his side. His arm fell heavily onto the empty space she'd just left, claiming it without noticing it was gone.
The bathroom door clicked shut behind her. The sound echoed too loudly, like a gunshot in a church.
The marble floor was cold beneath her bare feet. She welcomed it. Grounding. Real.
She leaned against the counter, staring at her reflection for half a second before she pressed play.
The video wasn't a se-x tape.
That would have been easier. Simpler. Something she could scream about. Something that fit into the shape of ordinary betrayal.
This was worse.
The footage was grainy, handheld, poorly lit. A nursery washed in soft yellow light. The camera shook slightly, as if whoever was holding it hadn't slept in days.
A woman stepped into frame.
Leone recognized her instantly.
Jay's former backup singer. The one who'd ""quit"" mid-tour two years ago. The one whose name had been quietly scrubbed from conversations. From contracts. From memory.
She was rocking a baby.
The child couldn't have been more than ten months old. Small fists. Downy hair. A face still soft with infancy.
Then the camera zoomed in.
Leone stopped breathing.
Jay's eyes stared back at her from that tiny face. Amber-gold. Unmistakable. The same eyes that had held hers during their vows. The same ones that had looked at her tonight, bright with success, promising forever in a language she'd trusted too easily.
""Say Dada,"" the woman whispered, her voice tired and sharp all at once. ""Say it. Tell him we're done being his dirty little secret while he plays house with his barren ice queen.""
The word hit Leone like a physical blow.
Barren.
Her fingers curled around the edge of the counter as something inside her fractured quietly, efficiently.
Three years.
Three years of negative tests and invasive procedures. Three years of calendar tracking and whispered hope. Of doctors' offices that smelled like antiseptic and disappointment. Of appointments Jay always had ""conflicts"" for.
Three years of him holding her while she cried. Of him telling her it didn't matter. That she was enough. That they had time.
He'd been comforting her while another woman carried his child.
Leone swiped the screen with a shaking thumb.
The video ended, replaced by a trail of messages. Evidence unfolding with cruel patience.
Wire transfers labeled Studio Session Fees, routed monthly to a Brooklyn brownstone she'd never seen. NDAs with subject lines like The Leone Situation. Text threads between Jay and Marcus discussing damage control and keeping the brand clean.
Voice memos.
Jay's voice filled the bathroom, calm and controlled.
""Don't post anything. Don't go anywhere she might see. Just wait. I'll handle it.""
Her stomach turned.
She scrolled again.
An email.
Jay to his lawyer. Dated six months ago.
If Leone finds out, we spin it as a separation that already happened. Plant stories about her being difficult and controlling. The public will take my side. They always do. She has no solo career without me. She'll have no choice but to stay quiet.
Leone read it once.
Then again.
By the third time, something vital had gone numb.
She wasn't his wife.
She was strategy.
The Power Couple brand wasn't love. It was armor. A fortress he hid behind while building a second family, brick by careful brick.
The phone buzzed again.
Another message. This one sent directly to Jay.
He said his first word today. Dada. He keeps looking for you. How much longer do we have to be your shame?
A photo followed.
Jay in the brownstone. Sitting on a couch Leone had never touched. Holding the baby. Smiling.
Not the polite, distant smile he wore in public.
A real one.
The kind that reached his eyes.
The door handle rattled.
""Leone?"" Jay's voice was thick with sleep, but there was something else under it now. Alertness. Calculation. ""Baby, why is the door locked?""
She didn't answer.
She stared at herself in the mirror instead.
Her posture was perfect. Years of discipline had carved that into her bones. Her face was pale, eyes hollow, lips pressed into a line that had learned restraint too well.
She saw the woman who had stepped back from the stage so Jay could step forward. The one who'd ghostwritten lyrics that made women cry. Who'd choreographed shows that sold out arenas. Who'd negotiated contracts while he stayed blissfully ""creative.""
The hidden architect of his empire.
Erased with intention.
""Leone,"" he said again, sharper now. ""Give me my phone.""
She turned on the faucet.
Cold water rushed into the sink, loud and relentless, drowning out the sound of his knocking. She let it run, watched it pool, spill, disappear down the drain.
Jay's voice rose on the other side of the door. Frustrated. Controlled. Still convinced this was something he could manage.
She didn't respond.
She didn't pack.
She didn't cry.
She slipped past the bedroom once the noise stopped, moved through the house like a shadow that had finally learned how to detach itself from the light.
She left his phone on the marble vanity. The video looping. The messages stacked like a confession he could no longer outrun.
She left her wedding ring beside it.
By the time Jay forced the bathroom door open, the house was silent in a way it had never been before.
Leone was gone.
Three days later, the divorce papers were delivered to Jay's recording studio in the middle of a live radio interview. A legal courier. No warning. No privacy. Just paper and precision.
The note inside was brief.
You wanted a performance. Here's your finale.
Jay stared at it long after the microphones were turned off.
He didn't follow her that night.
He told himself she needed space. That this was shock, not departure. That by morning, with the right words, the right plan, the right leverage, he could fix it.
He had always fixed things.
He sat alone in the studio as the city woke up around him, convinced the silence was temporary.
Outside, the world was already shifting.
And Leone was already gone.
Jay woke to silence that felt wrong.
Not peaceful. Not earned. Wrong.
The space beside him was cold, the sheets barely wrinkled, as if no one had slept there at all. His arm lay across emptiness, fingers curling instinctively before his mind caught up. Leone was never an early riser after nights like this. She liked to linger. To stretch. To breathe him in as if she were memorizing something.
Jay pushed himself upright, the dull ache of last night's champagne pressing behind his eyes. Sunlight cut through the floor-to-ceiling windows, too bright, too sharp. The Grammy on the nightstand threw it back at him in fractured gold.
He stared at it for a long second.
Then his gaze moved.
The bathroom door was open.
That shouldn't have mattered. It did.
""Leone?"" His voice came out rough, unused, stripped of its usual confidence.
Nothing answered him.
Jay swung his legs off the bed and stood, the world tilting slightly before steadying. He moved through the bedroom, into the bathroom, expecting steam, water, some sign of motion he could explain away.
The vanity was pristine.
Too pristine.
His phone lay exactly where he hadn't left it, screen dark, face up. Beside it sat Leone's wedding ring, placed with almost surgical precision, the diamond catching the light like a blade.
Jay stopped breathing.
For a heartbeat, something sharp and animal tried to claw its way up his chest. Panic hovered, close enough to taste. He reached for the phone, his fingers stiff, his pulse loud in his ears.
The screen lit up.
The video was still paused mid-frame. A nursery. A woman's shoulder. The soft curve of a child's cheek.
Jay exhaled slowly.
Right.
That.
He scrubbed a hand over his face, forcing his thoughts into order. Panic was useless. Emotion was a luxury he didn't have time for. This wasn't a personal crisis. It was a situation. Situations could be managed.
Leone hadn't confronted him. She hadn't screamed. She hadn't destroyed anything. She'd left quietly.
Which meant she was hurt. Shocked. Acting on emotion.
Emotion passed.
Jay straightened, rolling his shoulders back as if preparing for a meeting instead of the wreckage of his marriage. He picked up his phone and scrolled, skimming messages, emails, alerts. Notifications stacked on notifications, but nothing from Leone.
Good.
Silence meant leverage.
He didn't call her.
Not yet.
Instead, he tapped Marcus's name.
The line connected on the first ring.
""You saw it,"" Marcus said without greeting.
Jay leaned against the vanity, eyes on the ring. ""I'm aware.""
A pause. ""Is she there?""
""No.""
Another pause. He could hear Marcus shifting, already recalibrating. ""Did she say anything?""
Jay smiled faintly, despite himself. ""She didn't need to.""
""That's not ideal.""
""Relax,"" Jay said, calm, measured. ""She left in shock. She'll cool off.""
""You don't know that.""
""I do,"" Jay replied. ""Leone doesn't burn bridges. She freezes them.""
Marcus sighed. ""The mistress is unstable. She's pushing harder. The video was meant for you, not her.""
""And yet,"" Jay said lightly, ""here we are.""
Silence stretched between them, thick with shared history. Fixes. Cover-ups. Carefully buried problems.
""We need to get ahead of this,"" Marcus said. ""If Leone talks—""
""She won't,"" Jay cut in. ""She knows how this works.""
Marcus hesitated. ""You sure you want to test that?""
Jay's jaw tightened. ""I know my wife.""
The words felt solid. Certain. Leone had always been rational. Strategic. She understood optics. She understood brand. he-ll, she'd helped build his.
""She'll come back,"" Jay continued. ""Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But she will.""
""And if she doesn't?""
Jay pushed off the counter, pacing now. ""Then we frame it as a separation that's been ongoing. Emotional distance. Creative differences. Stress. You know the language.""
Marcus was quiet for a beat too long.
""You already drafted that,"" Marcus said.
Jay stopped. ""What?""
""You sent it to legal six months ago.""
Right.
Jay closed his eyes briefly. ""Then we're prepared.""
""This could still blow,"" Marcus said. ""The kid—""
""Is contained,"" Jay snapped. ""For now.""
""For now,"" Marcus echoed. ""Sponsors are skittish lately. Optics matter.""
""They always do,"" Jay said. ""Which is why we don't move until Leone does.""
""You want to wait?""
""I want control.""
Marcus exhaled. ""She's not just your wife, Jay.""
Jay smiled again, sharper this time. ""Exactly.""
They ended the call with a plan already half-formed, the familiar hum of coordination easing the tension in Jay's chest. This was territory he understood. Crisis. Damage. Recovery.
He showered quickly, scrubbing away the smell of last night, of her. He dressed with care, choosing black, tailored, controlled. The man the world expected.
As he left the bedroom, his gaze caught on the empty closet.
Leone's side was untouched. Dresses still hung in perfect order. Shoes aligned like soldiers awaiting command.
She hadn't packed.
Another point in his favor.
By noon, the first articles started appearing.
Speculative. Careful. Sources say tensions have been mounting. Jay skimmed them without flinching. Nothing he couldn't outpace.
He was in his studio when the courier arrived.
Live radio interview. Red light glowing. Jay halfway through answering a question about creative evolution when the producer's face went pale.
""Jay,"" she mouthed. ""There's someone here.""
He nodded, unbothered. ""We're good,"" he said into the mic, smooth. ""Art is always born from tension.""
The door opened.
The courier didn't smile.
Jay accepted the envelope with a nod, tucking it aside, already planning to open it later. He finished the segment flawlessly, voice warm, charismatic, intact.
Only when the room cleared did he break the seal.
The divorce papers slid free, crisp and impersonal.
Jay stared at them.
Then he laughed.
A short, incredulous sound.
""She wouldn't,"" he murmured, more amused than angry.
The note fell out last.
You wanted a performance. Here's your finale.
The smile slid from his face.
For the first time since waking up, something unsettled shifted in his chest. Not fear. Not yet.
Surprise.
Leone had gone further than he'd expected. Faster. Louder.
He picked up his phone, thumb hovering over her name.
Then he stopped.
No.
Calling now would look desperate. Reactionary. It would hand her control she didn't know she had.
Silence was leverage.
Jay set the phone down and stared through the glass wall of the studio, at the city he'd conquered piece by piece.
Leone would come back. She always did.
And when she did, he would be ready.
Jay didn't sleep that night.
Not because he was spiraling. Not because regret kept him awake. Because there was work to do.
By morning, the city was already buzzing, the kind of low, electric hum that followed any major win or impending scandal. Jay sat in his penthouse office with a mug of coffee gone cold in his hand, staring at the skyline like it owed him something.
He'd always believed control was a muscle.
You didn't lose it overnight. You trained it. You flexed it. You trusted it to show up when things got ugly.
And things were getting ugly.
His phone vibrated again. Marcus. Of course.
Jay answered without looking at the screen. ""Talk.""
""You're trending,"" Marcus said. No greeting. No buffer.
Jay leaned back in his chair. ""That was inevitable.""
""Not like this."" Papers shuffled on the other end. ""Divorce filings leaked faster than expected. Someone tipped a blogger. Mid-tier, but hungry.""
Jay smirked. ""They always are.""
""This isn't funny.""
""It's predictable,"" Jay corrected. ""What's the angle?""
""Sympathy bait,"" Marcus said. ""They're framing Leone as blindsided. Quiet. Devoted. Wronged.""
Jay's jaw tightened, just slightly. ""And me?""
""Aloof. Successful. Possibly unfaithful, though they're careful with language.""
Jay exhaled through his nose. ""So nothing new.""
Marcus hesitated. ""There's chatter about a child.""
Jay straightened. ""From who?""
""Not clear yet. Could be the mistress leaking through a proxy. Could be someone in your inner circle.""
Jay's eyes hardened. ""Lock it down.""
""We're trying. But she's getting louder. She wants acknowledgment.""
""She's emotional,"" Jay said dismissively. ""That's not leverage.""
""It becomes leverage if she goes public.""
""She won't,"" Jay said, confident. ""Not without losing everything she thinks she wants.""
Marcus sighed. ""You're assuming everyone plays chess.""
Jay smiled thinly. ""I'm assuming I do.""
He stood and crossed the room, the glass walls reflecting a man perfectly put together. Black suit. Relaxed posture. Control worn like a second skin.
""Draft a statement,"" Jay continued. ""Soft separation language. Emphasize mutual respect. Creative distance. No blame.""
""You want to confirm the split?""
""I want to manage it,"" Jay said. ""There's a difference.""
""And Leone?""
Jay's fingers drummed against the glass. ""Leave her out of it.""
Marcus paused. ""Out of respect?""
Jay didn't answer right away. ""Out of strategy.""
Silence stretched between them.
""You really think she's coming back,"" Marcus said finally.
Jay turned, meeting his own reflection. ""I know she is.""
That belief settled in him easily. Comfortably. Leone had always come back. After fights. After disappointments. After sacrifices he hadn't fully noticed until they were already made.
She was loyal. Practical. She understood timing.
""She's hurt,"" Jay continued. ""But she's not reckless. Once the shock wears off, she'll see this for what it is.""
""And what is it?"" Marcus asked.
""A mess,"" Jay said calmly. ""Not an ending.""
Marcus didn't sound convinced. ""If she talks—""
""She won't,"" Jay said again. Firmer this time. ""She knows how much is at stake.""
""Does she?"" Marcus pressed. ""Because from where I'm standing, she just went nuclear.""
Jay's lips curved into a humorless smile. ""No. She filed paperwork. That's not nuclear. That's leverage.""
He ended the call before Marcus could respond.
The day unfolded in carefully controlled chaos. Meetings. Calls. Emails drafted and redrafted. Jay approved language with a surgeon's precision, cutting anything too sharp, too apologetic, too human.
By afternoon, the first official statement went live.
After much reflection, Jay Sullivan and his wife Leone have decided to take time apart to focus on their individual journeys. The decision was mutual and made with respect.
Mutual. Respect.
Jay read it twice, satisfied.
He expected Leone to call then. Or text. Or at least react in some way.
She didn't.
That absence began to itch.
By evening, the humor in the situation had thinned. Jay stood in the kitchen, phone in hand, staring at her name in his contacts. The urge to call rose, sharp and unwelcome.
He ignored it.
Calling now would give her the upper hand. It would confirm she'd rattled him.
Instead, he poured a drink and paced the room, replaying the night in fragments he refused to linger on. The video. The word barren. The way she hadn't screamed.
That part bothered him more than he liked to admit.
Leone was many things, but she wasn't quiet when pushed.
Unless she was done.
Jay dismissed the thought as quickly as it came.
At nine, Marcus called again. Jay let it ring twice before answering.
""She hired a shark,"" Marcus said without preamble.
Jay froze. ""Who?""
""Her lawyer. Top-tier. The kind that doesn't posture.""
A flicker of irritation cut through him. ""She didn't need to do that.""
""She did it anyway.""
Jay took a slow breath. ""Fine. We'll counter.""
""You don't counter someone like this,"" Marcus said. ""You brace.""
Jay's grip tightened on the phone. ""You're being dramatic.""
""I'm being realistic.""
Jay laughed softly. ""You're forgetting something.""
""What?""
""She still loves me.""
The words hung there, heavy and unchallenged.
Marcus didn't argue. That worried Jay more than if he had.
After the call ended, Jay stood alone in the dimly lit penthouse, the city blinking back at him like an audience waiting for a cue.
He checked his phone again.
Still nothing.
No missed calls. No texts. No angry messages. No tears disguised as rage.
Leone had vanished into silence, and for the first time, Jay wasn't sure how long silence could be stretched before it snapped.
He opened a drawer and pulled out a folder he hadn't touched in months. Old contracts. Tour notes. Handwritten edits in Leone's neat script. Lyrics she'd sharpened. Decisions she'd quietly made that had changed everything.
He stared at the pages longer than he meant to.
""I know She'll come back,"" he said aloud, as if the room needed reminding. ""She always does.""
The words sounded thinner than they had that morning.
Still, he straightened, closed the folder, and slid it back into place. Doubt was a crack he couldn't afford.
Control was a muscle.
And he would keep flexing it until the world fell back into line.",1,1769780506.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

I found a purple hippo beanie baby, big stain on the side but can be washed. 

As well as more things of photos, including one from a Christmas party that my mom hosted here at our house in 2001. Stuff was already piling up in the corners and on the table. It wasn’t bad and the floor and furniture was clear, but I could notice it.  I didn’t realize it started that early, I thought I was 5 when the house started piling up. 

And I discovered that we have a door jam for the front door. Never knew that cause that area was piled before. 

Also, somewhere in the living room is a coffee table, didn’t know we had that either. 

Now that everything on that side of the living room has the trash removed, my next step is the giant mail pile right next to the front door on the other side and attempting to unearth one of our couches.

Before my wedding, I ended two long-term friendships and removed both people from my wedding. I don’t regret my decision, but I’m curious whether I handled it fairly.

One friend, Will, had been my best friend since childhood (over 10 years). The other, Ana, was someone I met later while living in the U.S. She was often misunderstood and didn’t have many close friends, and I spent years supporting and defending her. I eventually introduced Will and Ana, and the three of us became very close, especially during COVID.

In 2021, I met my now-husband, Robert. Robert got along really well with Will and always encouraged me to maintain that friendship. He never tried to control who I spent time with. His first impression of Ana, however, was uncomfortable. The first time they met, she arrived very late and mostly spoke in our native language while the three of us were together—even though she and I are fluent in English and Robert only speaks English. While it felt awkward, Robert never discouraged my friendship with her.

About nine months into dating, I moved in with Robert. This caused tension with my parents due to cultural expectations. Around the same time, I was working full-time with a long commute and had much less energy for socializing. I naturally went out less, but I still made an effort to stay connected through texts, calls, FaceTime, and occasional hangouts (game nights, dinners, coffee, etc.).

Over time, some interactions started to feel off. Ana made online comments that felt dismissive of my relationship. For example, when I once tweeted about how strange sports commentary sounds in English, she replied, “Nobody told you to date an American.” If I posted something vague or frustrated, she’d comment things like, “Did you guys break up?”

Eventually, both friends became distant and stopped responding. Six months after moving in together, Robert proposed.

While planning our wedding, I reached out to Will to confirm he’d received his invitation. After months of minimal contact, he replied saying our friendship had changed because I spent too much time with my partner. He also crossed a line by insulting my fiancé and implying the relationship wouldn’t last and he’d want to see where I’d go then.

Months later, Will apologized and said he understood I had a lot going on, but added that he wasn’t the only one who felt this way.

That led me to confront Ana. She confirmed she felt the same and said they were “worried” about me spending too much time with my fiancé.

What hurt most wasn’t concern itself, but the lack of communication. I had repeatedly reached out, but instead of talking to me directly, they distanced themselves, talked about me behind my back, and made me feel like the butt of a joke. Once my partner was insulted, I couldn’t see how the friendships could recover.

Because of this, I decided to end both friendships and remove them from my wedding. I wanted my wedding day to be surrounded by people who genuinely supported my relationship.

Now, three years later, my husband and I are happily married and have a newborn. I don’t regret my choice, but I sometimes wonder if I could’ve handled it differently.

AITAH for ending those friendships and not having them at my wedding?

TL;DR:

I ended two long-term friendships and removed them from my wedding after they became distant, talked behind my back, and insulted my relationship with my now-husband. They said they were “worried” I spent too much time with him, but never communicated directly. AITAH?",42,1769779944.0,AITAH,36,0.94,False

1qr5hiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qr5hiw/perpetually_single_and_not_by_choice/,Perpetually single and not by choice,"Hi everyone,

I was hoping some of you could help me or at least give me some ideas. I'm 23F and I've never been in a relationship or been on a date. I'm still in my third year of college so I'm slightly older than most men in my classes but only by a couple years, so it really doesn't set us apart too much maturity-wise. I've tried sparking conversations with men I've been interested in, but they never seem to want to continue the conversation past a couple of surface-level exchanges (i.e. looking back down at their phone or just seeming like they're in a hurry to get home). I go to a commuter school, so it's especially difficult to make connections because no one really sticks around after class.

I'm trying really hard to get through to someone and I'm starting to wonder if maybe it's just me that's the problem. I've been told I'm a very pretty girl and that I'm kind and sometimes a little funny. I have a job. I still live with my parents but I'm trying to save and work towards getting out on my own. I'm working on myself every day and trying to become better, but this one thing feels like a huge empty space in my life. I'm incredibly lonely, every day. I try not to let it get me down, but some days it's so hard to ignore that it feels physically painful and inescapable.

The other factor in this is that I have no true friends right now, and haven't for some time. I won't go into it now, but it's sort of life circumstances that got me to that point. This means that on Friday and Saturday nights, I don't go out. I don't really have anyone to go with to meet people, and my only ""outs"" are when I go to class twice a week, and when I go to work. I do have hobbies, I like to crochet and read, but unfortunately my schedule right now (work during the day and then evening classes) doesn't really allow for book clubs or hobby meetups. Sometimes I do go to coffee shops to get some work done and be around people, but I'm aware that people working look like they don't want to be bothered. I also like to go to bookstores.

I have considered dating apps but because of my lack of social life, I don't have photos of myself. I'm not a selfie taker really, I mean I have maybe one that I took that I think is nice, but it's outdated and I don't think I can put myself on these apps with just one selfie. I have nobody to take photos of me to put up. I also hear it's a bit of a nightmare on the apps, and I don't know how good it would be for my self esteem at this time in my life.

I'm not completely inexperienced. I've had two guys I spent some time with that I truly liked, but they were both unavailable emotionally and I was taken advantage of. Neither ever took me on a proper date, or wanted to be seen with me in daylight hours. I try not to let those experiences color my perspective on dating moving forward. I still have an open mind and open heart, regardless of how I might've been hurt in the past.

I know that without a picture, it's hard to tell if maybe someone is not meeting anyone because they're not attractive. You can DM me and I'll send you that selfie if you'd like a better idea of what I look like. I think I'm attractive enough but I guess maybe that's just what I think, I don't know

He was the one who brought up payment methods in the first place, so I thought he’d be quick to reply, but I got no response. After half a day, I was genuinely curious if he got it because he was always so quick to respond, so I reached out again, to which he immediately replied. He started talking about some issues with his roommates, and I tried to be polite about it, but since I’m truly not in a place to offer support, I was honest. He explained that he was just venting and didn’t need any support. But he never responded to the payment piece.

He later asked out of the blue when I was going to the craft store because I had mentioned that I wanted money for that. I genuinely thought this is when he’d send money, but he didn’t. After I had gone, I sent him the receipt (because we had discussed that). He said he’d get back to me soon, but never did. I reached out again after a few hours but got no response. After that, I got fed up and just deleted the chats. I could see when I was checking my DMs whether he was online or not, and he usually was active or was on a few minutes ago. He was never offline for more than an hour or two, so I know he was getting my messages. In the beginning, he’d always respond quickly, but after we talked about PayPal, he was much slower to reply and the topic would quickly drift. I realize now I should have kept the chats and took more screenshots!

All this took place over the course of four days and because I’m so new to this, I’m curious as to if this person was actually going to send money in the first place or was just a scammer. I’m looking for advice! Is there anything I did wrong? Or was this person just wasting my time from the start?

NOTE: Obviously, I need to work on my dominance when it comes to demanding money. That’s going to be a learning curve for me, since I’ve always been respectful of people’s earnings. But in this instance, I was trying to match this person’s energy, and since he said he didn’t want any roleplay, I was trying to be respectful of that.",0,1769779662.0,paypigsupportgroup,11,0.17,False

1qr5ai0,https://www.reddit.com/r/morningmessage/comments/1qr5ai0/happy_friday/,Happy Friday,"Good morning. Happy FEEL GOOD FRIDAY boys and girls. Hope everyone is staying warm and that today is all that you hope it to be. 

Our FEEL GOOD Friday message this morning hits close to home for me. John Wayne is one of my childhood heroes, I still search for his movies to watch now and then. As well, I am a PROUD American. These days where it seems to be all the rage to bash America and those who still see this country as the best in the world, I stand on the side of thanking God that I live in this great land, and of celebrating all the good America and Americans do for the entire world. 

Our FEEL GOOD FRIDAY message is below. 

March 1961.
A one-room schoolhouse in rural Montana.

A teacher named Margaret gives her twelve students a simple assignment: write one sentence to John Wayne. It’s meant to be harmless, almost playful—an exercise in writing, not a serious attempt at contact. She never expects a response.

Two weeks later, a delivery truck pulls up outside the school.

What it brings will change how those children see the country they’re growing up in.

The letter arrives in Hollywood on a Tuesday morning.

John Wayne’s office receives hundreds of letters every week—fan mail, autograph requests, business inquiries. Most are opened by assistants, answered with form replies, and filed away.

But this one is different.

The envelope is plain. Hand-addressed. Montana postmark.

Inside are three pages of lined notebook paper, written neatly in a teacher’s careful handwriting.

“Dear Mr. Wayne,
My name is Margaret. I teach at a small school in Montana—twelve students, ages six to fourteen. Most are ranchers’ children. We study your films to learn about American history and values.”

Wayne reads that sentence twice.

Study his films.

Not for entertainment. For values.

He keeps reading.

“We don’t have a film projector, so we read your scripts aloud. The children act out the scenes. It isn’t the same as seeing you on screen, but it helps them understand courage, honor, and what it means to be American.”

Wayne sets down his coffee.

He’s made dozens of westerns. Some classics. Some forgettable. He’s never thought of them as teaching tools—certainly not as moral instruction for children in a place most Americans never think about.

The letter continues:

“I’m writing to ask if you might have any advice for teaching these values. We’re just a small school, far from anywhere important, but I believe these lessons matter.”

At the bottom of the letter are twelve messages—one from each student, written in uneven, earnest handwriting.

“Dear Mr. Wayne, you are the bravest cowboy.” —Sarah, 7
“My dad says you’re a real American. I want to be like you.” —Billy, 10
“You never give up.” —Tommy, 8

Twelve children. One schoolhouse. Scripts read aloud because there’s no projector.

Wayne folds the letter carefully and puts it in his desk drawer. He sits there for a long moment.

He’s fifty-three years old. He’s played heroes for decades. But this—this is different.

He calls his business manager.

“How much does a good film projector cost?”

“A 16mm projector? A few hundred dollars.”

“Get the best one,” Wayne says. “And prints of ten films. The ones that matter.”

Stagecoach.
Red River.
She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.
Fort Apache.
Rio Grande.

Then he writes a check—five hundred dollars—made out not to himself, not to a charity, not to a foundation.

Just to the school.

No press release. No announcement.

Wayne sits down and writes a letter. One letter—for the teacher and the students together.

He takes his time. Crosses things out. Starts again.

“Dear Margaret and students,
Thank you for your letter. I’m honored—more than you know—that you study my films.
You asked about teaching values. Here’s what I believe.”

He writes:

“Courage isn’t the absence of fear. It’s doing what’s right even when you’re scared.
Honor is keeping your word when nobody’s watching.
Being American means believing everyone matters—even people in small towns far from anywhere.”

Then:

“I’m sending you a projector and some films. Not because you asked—but because students like you deserve to see these stories the way they were meant to be seen.
You’re not just twelve kids in Montana. You’re twelve Americans. And that’s everybody.”

He signs it simply:

Your friend,
Duke.

The projector and films are shipped. No one is told. No credit is taken.

He moves on to his next movie.

Six months later, Wayne is in Montana filming How the West Was Won. Big production. Cold weather. Remote mountains.

One rainy day shuts down filming. The crew waits it out.

Wayne gets restless.

He asks a local where the nearest school is.

They point him down a long road.

When Wayne walks into that one-room schoolhouse, the children freeze.

They recognize him instantly.

He doesn’t give a speech. He doesn’t pose for photographs. He shakes hands. Asks questions. Watches as they run his films on the projector.

The teacher realizes who paid for it.

Wayne tells her quietly, “Just seemed like the right thing.”

That projector stayed in that school for years.
Those films were shown to generations of kids.

And twelve children learned something important—not just from the movies, but from the man behind them.

That fame doesn’t excuse distance.
That values mean nothing if they’re only spoken, never practiced.
And that sometimes the most patriotic thing you can do is show up for people no one else is watching.

John Wayne never talked about it publicly.

He didn’t have to.

The lesson reached exactly who it was meant for.

When I’m on, my alarm goes off and I’m immediately out of bed. I shower, do my full morning routine, eat breakfast, have coffee, get dressed without rushing, walk my dogs, and still have a little extra time before work. At work I feel good and optimistic, often finishing tasks early, which lets me clean, organize, and plan for the next day. I get home, do chores, make dinner, work on hobbies, and still have a relaxing evening.

When I’m off, getting out of bed feels hard. Even if I don’t wake up especially late, I barely have time for my morning routine and usually skip parts of it. At work, starting tasks feels difficult. I do a few things, and then suddenly it’s the end of the day and I’m pushing things to tomorrow. By the time I get home and do the bare essentials—eating and a few chores just to get by—it’s already time to sleep.

How is this possible? It’s extra frustrating having been “on” and knowing I’m totally capable. I’m off right now, what do you all do that helps when this happens?",6,1769779186.0,ADHD,4,1.0,False

Hi everyone,

Like many of you, I play *Le Mans Ultimate* with a wheel. It's basically impossible to move my hands to the keyboard to type ""Sorry"" or ""Pitting"" during a race without crashing or losing massive time.

I set up a simple AutoHotkey (AHK) script that handles this automatically. It types the message instantly and presses Enter, all in a fraction of a second. I mapped these to my Numpad (which I can hit blindly), but you can also map them to buttons on your wheel.

Here is the script and a guide on how to set it up for free.

# ""Wait, why not just use the in-game Quick Chats?""

I anticipated this question! If you look at the **Controls > Interaction** menu in-game, you will see binding options for *Quick Chat #1*, *Quick Chat #2*, etc.

**Here is why I don't use them:**

1. **You can't change the text easily:** The menu lets you bind a button, but you can't choose what it says. You're stuck with robotic defaults like ""Driver Swap"" unless you dig into game files (`userdata/.json`) and edit code manually.
2. **Safety:** The in-game system often requires navigating a ""Message Center"" menu while driving. This script is **one button press**. I hit the key, and the message is sent before my finger leaves the button.
3. **Visibility:** This script forces the text into the main Chat Box where everyone is guaranteed to see it, rather than a small notification overlay.

# How to Set It Up (Step-by-Step)

1. **Download AutoHotkey:** Google it and download the standard version (v1.1 or v2 is fine, this script is v1 compatible).
2. **Create the File:** Right-click on your Desktop > **New** \> **AutoHotkey Script**. Name it `LMU_Chat.ahk`.
3. **Edit:** Right-click the file > **Edit Script**. Delete any default text.
4. **Paste:** Copy the code block above and paste it in. Save and close.
5. **Run:** Double-click the file before you start the game.

**Troubleshooting:**

* **Do NOT run as Administrator:** If you run the script as Admin, the game's anti-cheat or permissions might block it. Just run it normally.
* **Check your Chat Key:** The script assumes your in-game chat key is **'t'**. If you changed it to something else, update the `Send, t` line at the bottom of the script.

**Need help setting this up?** This guide should cover everything, but if you aren't comfortable editing script files or setting this up yourself, feel free to DM me. I’m happy to hop on Discord and set the whole thing up for you for a small $2 ""buy me a coffee"" donation for the time.

I will send u the scripts for free if u can set it up urself, DM ur email or discord I will drop .ahk file!

ive struggled with my mental health for years, mostly depression like symptoms but in the last few years ive struggled heavily with delusions and paranoia. i also suspect i have adhd, but im not self diagnosing and my parents wont let me get any help for this so i cant fully know what i have.

my plan currently is to move out and take a gap year to get help (mostly for the adhd, if i do have it. the focus issues in general if i dont) and then enter college once im a little more stable. i just dont want to crash and burn because everyone says nursing school is a nightmare when youre healthy and mentally all here, and im not, generally.

i tend to be pessimistic so idk maybe its that affecting my worldview but im so nervous ill just fail the moment i try when i could be spending that time studying for a different career. to the people who have actually gone through nursing school, is it worth it?

Instead of bold statements or trend-driven pieces, it focuses on restraint, balance, and materials that age beautifully.

This style is often described as a warmer evolution of minimalism: less stark, more relaxed, and far more inviting. Think refined, European-inspired interiors that feel calm and elevated—but never stiff or showy.



If you love elegant, stately spaces with a modern edge—and want to avoid the cost and effort of sourcing true antiques—antique-inspired modern furniture is the key. With the right selections, you can achieve the quiet luxury look through thoughtful furniture choices alone. Let’s explore the core elements of the Old Money aesthetic—and how to bring them into your home with modern furnishings.

https://preview.redd.it/hkc23647ihgg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7efc629e7f2cbd789a98f199f0bc74824bd82384

# Layered, Tactile Textures

One of the most important principles of the Old Money aesthetic is richness through texture—not excess. These spaces are typically uncluttered, with only a few focal furniture pieces. What elevates them is material depth:



* Natural wood grains with visible variation
* Stone surfaces
* Upholstery in linen, velvet, wool, or leather
* Soft patterns like subtle stripes, plaids, or florals

Furniture should feel substantial but not flashy—think tailored sofas, gently tufted seating, refined armchairs, and solid wood tables with a sense of weight and permanence.



How to apply it with furniture:

Choose fewer pieces, but prioritize materials you can feel. A stone-accented coffee table, a softly upholstered sofa, or a textured wood side table adds quiet richness without visual noise.

# Architectural Influence (Without Remodeling)



Traditional Old Money interiors are known for architectural features like crown molding, wainscoting, arches, and coffered ceilings. But if you’re not renovating, furniture can do much of this work for you.

Look for:

* Furniture with strong vertical or horizontal lines
* Soft curves, arches, and framed silhouettes
* Paneled doors, fluted fronts, or recessed detailing

These elements echo classic architecture and add depth and structure to a room—especially in modern homes or apartments.



How to apply it with furniture:

Cabinet, media console, coffee table, sideboard, that with fluted panels, framed drawer fronts, or subtle curves can introduce architectural character without permanent changes.

# Timeless, Muted Color Palettes

Quiet luxury interiors rely on colors that feel enduring, not seasonal.

Common Old Money tones include:

* Deep greens, warm mahogany, navy, and muted blues
* Warm browns and rich wood tones
* Charcoal, taupe, cream, and soft beige

These hues create a grounded, serene atmosphere and allow craftsmanship and materials to stand out.



How to apply it with furniture:

Anchor your space with neutral furniture—warm wood finishes, upholstered pieces in beige or soft grey—and layer in darker tones sparingly. Avoid high-contrast or overly trendy colors that date quickly.

# Thoughtful Artwork & Decor (Less, but Better)



Artwork plays an important role in Old Money interiors, but it’s never overwhelming. The focus is on:



* Classic compositions: landscapes, portraits, still lifes
* Substantial frames or understated traditional molding
* Sculptural objects, ceramic vessels, and mirrors with history-inspired forms



Every piece feels intentional, not decorative for decoration’s sake.



How to apply it with furniture:

Let furniture provide the foundation, then style lightly. A credenza with one framed artwork, a sculptural lamp, and a single ceramic piece feels far more luxurious than an overfilled surface.

So they never went. There was never anything to do there either, some cute skirts but they could see em after an all, so Jacob, Stuart and Arnie did what they did every schoolday. They ditched to smoke a few bowls in the 7/11 parking lot where the gutterpunks drank store brand mouthwash five-finger discounted from the Riteaid down the street. They would drink till their filthy bellies swelled. Gorged. Their stomachs while long battered and well worn would still nonetheless grow upset after a few hours of guzzling the swill and they would spew the aqua-green/blue regurgitant out in a geyser fountain. Projectile like a firehose. Total spray. When they did so it was always in a group, just like everything else they did, and as a result the whole dirty place would suddenly, briefly, smell of a minty-green wintery fresh wonderland that made the boys think and feel of cheap Christmas things. They loved it. Thought it was absolutely fucking hilarious. But also, in its own demented haphazard whitetrash way, magical. 

Dandy and Scrooloose didn't let the boys down. They blasted foaming green fluoride geysers out of their rotten drugged out homeless mouths and created a curiously pleasant miasma around the squalid little ghetto place. The trio laughed and cheefed their weed. Stuart went inside for snacks before they all departed for Arnie's house. His mother was never home. While inside the little fluorescent blasted place he'd grabbed something else as well. A surprise, for his other two cohorts. His friends. The gutterpunks had given him an idea.

…

Arnie's basement was any fifteen year old’s dream. Playstation and his own private TV. Refrigerator. Stereo. It was simple. But they were simple boys. Of simple upbringing. Blunt even, these boys, this truant three. Blunt instruments that lacked finer cogs and working moving parts within their child-savage skulls to better know and understand and differentiate what should not and what should be. 

What we should do. And what we should not. 

The bloodshed began with Stuart’s surprise. 

They were in the middle of a Smash Bros match, the other two, Jacob and Arnie, when he'd placed it on the small coffee table before them next to their little green bottles of Mountain Dew and cakes of Hostess bread and processed cream. 

Three bottles of cough syrup. Extra strength. One for each. And three boxes of extra strength Triple C’s. 

The other two looked at him like he was an idiot. Then laughed. But Stuart kept right on smiling. Unperturbed. 

Jacob chided him, “Oh, what're ya Lil Weezy or some shit now? You're fucking stupid, we have weed you fucking moron!"" 

“This ain't the same. This ain't like codeine shit. That's a narcotic. This shit has a chemical in it that makes you trip out. Like see shit an stuff."" 

Arnie made a face. Jacob just laid in once more. 

“What're you talking about?"" 

Stuart shrugged. His confident face and gaze faltered from the other two and drifted away, first to the right and then to the floor. 

“I dunno, it's supposed to be like acid or shrooms or something. I dunno."" 

“You didn't pay for alla this?"" asked Arnie. Implying it to be a waste. 

“It wasn't that much…"" Stuart was losing all confidence now. The ship was sinking fast and he wanted off. Regretted setting sail in the first place. What an idiot. 

Jacob started laughing then and Arnie followed after. 

Stuart got a little angry. More than a little flustered. Red in the face, he brought to the table an indisputable, irrefutable piece of proof. Something the other two fuckwads couldn't deny. 

“You guys are fucking dumb, you just don't know, my big brother and his friends do this shit all the time, they have hella fuckin fun, dumbasses.”

The other two stopped laughing. 

A beat. 

Holy shit. That changed everything. Stuart's big brother Cameron was like the coolest fucking guy, not just at school but like the whole fucking town. If he thought it was cool and he said it got you hella high an shit…

That changed everything. 

Not really knowing what they were doing and not really caring, it'd never stopped the three before, the boys tore into the packages. They divided the pills amongst themselves, each box had 48 pills each, they'd take the pills in a couple of handfuls and chase them down with the syrup. 

“I feel like this is gonna make me barf."" said Arnie, eyeing the pills and the black-green-blue bottle of store brand stuff in his other hand. He then eyed the other two. 

The other two boys eyed him back. 

They'd huffed engine enamel, coolant, spray paint, snorted kiddie speed, all in the pursuit of chasing down the hours and murdering the time. 

""C’mon, man. Don't be a pussy.” said Jacob. A smirk across his laconic teenage face. 

And with that the boys toasted, To Pussy!, and laughed and then threw back their handfuls and began to chug the thick dark liquid that would seal their shared three fates. 

Arnie called it. He puked almost immediately drenching his carpet and the table before him. The other two flipped him off and laughed and kept right at it, another handful and chugging guzzles. He flipped the fuckers right back in return. Assholes. 

Then the last handful each. The last of their bottles too. Jacob and Stuart had worked quick. But they both had to admit, they did honestly feel really sick. 

They sat there in silence, a moment or two. Awhile. The minutes rolled past as they waited for whatever the hell was supposed to happen to start happening. 

“This shit better actually work. I think I might follow Arnie ‘fore not too long."" 

“It takes a second, stupid. You have to let it hit your stomach and then your blood."" 

“How long ya gotta wait?"" Jacob was no longer in love with this idea. 

“I dunno, maybe like another hour or two or something. Just wait, dude it's gonna be hella fun."" 

Arnie, still toweling up his syrupy green vomit, just looked at them pitifully. Left out. 

“You guys still ain't feelin it?"" 

Stuart and Jacob shook their heads slowly, a little nauseous each. 

No. Nothing. 

“You guys are jerks, you could at least help ME EWMzzMzzzzMMMM zzzzzZTTzzME me Me ME!!!!

ME 

MM

EM

MMME

ME

Me

The body that Stuart used to inhabit fell out and far and away from him. He drifted out drunkenly and gelatinous as Arnie's face turned to twisted misshapen malformed bats and screaming yellow things, bugs out the eyes and mosquitoes out his ears. Squirming writhing black worms and creatures. He tried to scream but it merely bubbled inside him. He wanted back. He wanted back in the familiar meatsack thing!

And then he was but the floor was shifting purple that was sometimes liquid and the TV was just a giant wet lidless eye. Red. Irritated and tearing and needing something from him, but he couldn’t figure what. The basement around him had been replaced with voiding space that had something swimming in it unseen but seeing him. 

Stuart looked to the eye. The lidless glistening swelled organ. What do you want from me?

I miss when there was Smash Bros on this thing…

“It's alright, kid. Ya get used to it. You're kwisatz haderachian. You'll see. You'll see."" 

Stuart turned to look as the world around him suddenly bled lurid crimson. A wound had been opened up in this time and space. 

He looked like a horrendous cross between little green Dagobah Yoda and the sneering bastardly unclean Lamisil goblin-thing. Flesh a terrible pus-color mixture and dried out and dead in places while loose and scrotal in other stretchy taffy-like patches. Pustules and pores that smelled and oozed of cheese were all about his wretched form. Slovenly he was draped upon the couch beside Stuart. Breathing and seething terrible audible gurgled mucus laden throaty breaths and absolutely reeking of European vinegar and cream. His eyes were wide glistening globes filled with rancid old hobo’s desperate angry piss. Shot through with lines of red that made junkies drool and sing. 

It splayed out a clawing hand to the child, fingers webbed and dripping with thick globs of dumpster jelly. Corpse butter. It forked out the peace sign at em. Like a hippy. 

“‘Sup, kid? How's it hangin?” And then a little less friendly, ""Who sent cha?”

""What?” said Stuart. 

""Just messin with ya. How're ya feeling?”

A beat. 

""I'm a little bit scared.”

""That's alright, bud. You should be.”

A beat. The wound of the world all around them now bled deeper and more freely. 

Another, more blood, this world filled and drank it all in scenic and in crash-loop swirls. Hypnotic. And with urgent voracious greed. It rapidly danced all above them. The eye still watched them in place of the TV. 

""I think I wanna be done with this now.”

Payn, Yoda of the foulest swamp in unimagined Hells, just smiled and tilted his head. His teeth green and glossy with translucent slime and swimming with tiny leeching things. 

""I wanna go back to my friends and home now.” A beat. And then much smaller and more pitifully, ""please..”

""Nah, ya don't need those retards! Look, man.” He pointed out to the bleeding space as something like a fly without wings crawled out of one of his large goblin ears, ""Look, little Hitler. Look, man. I compel you, you little fucking slave!"" 

And he did look out into the bleeding space now transforming into a blood soaked saturated mess rendition of Arnie's precious basement… but it didn't stop shifting and bleeding and changing then, swirling gore mixture world, a sinew hypno swirl spin of familiar things and objects and blood and muscle tissue and organ meat. Meat. 

Meat. 

But then this too began to break down. 

Into countless…

countless…

Countless trillions upon trillions of spinning dancing demon planets that made up everything. 

They fought a Star Wars dogfight before his eyes, the trillions upon trillions of little demon planets. And flying daredevil amongst them all, SQUADRON X. Blasting and making short work of so many of the near countless twirling mad demonic molecular things. They make up everything these spinning dancing demon planets. Rocketing and maneuvering with such blinding speed that they betrayed us all the illusion of a solid. None of us are whole and solid. All of us are bastard conglomerates of little whirling demon things. Lucifer. Evil. None of us are solid or whole and all of us are made of spinning devil moons. Microscopic. Wicked dots colored and shooting colored things. Violent. Evil. Lucifer. Made of the devil. Not whole or solid at all. Only dancing illusion. Only fabricated reality. Only dancing. Only fabric. 

Arnie jumped back and shrieked as Stuart bolted to the PlayStation, ripped it from the small stand next to the television and bounded back over and began to bash in Jacob's foaming mouth and seizing face. Crushing and destroying both in violent blasting heaving strikes that shot plastic and teeth and blood and shredded boy-face and flesh out in terrible vivid sprays. 

Jacob's legs danced and jigged and shuddered unnaturally as Stuart screamed and continued to blast his dying friend’s shattering face with more and more heavier and heavier blows. All the while shrieking at the top of his young lungs,

“The trillions of little demon things! The trillions of little demon things! Payn told me! Payn told me and showed me! THE LITTLE FUCKING DEMON THINGS!!”

Arnie watched his mad friend godroar and decimate their friend Jacob's ruined mashed face and skull. He didn't understand. He was so fucking scared. Completely locked and terrified. Cold. One moment Stuart went completely white and silent, then Jacob had started having a seizure or some shit. Flopping and dying on the floor of his basement like some fish. Now this. 

Now this. 

He didn't know what the fuck to do. He distantly felt the crotch of his pants grow warm as he pissed his pants absentmindedly and watched one best friend beat the other one to death. Screaming. Screaming something that didn't make any sense. 

Arnie was praying for his mother to come home and find him and save him and maybe poor Jacob too, to stop Stuart, please… when he suddenly stopped pounding Jacob's brains into the soaked and blood-drinking carpet of the basement floor and turned to look at him with wet glistening red eyes. Eyes that were filled with blind animal rage. Madness. 

Stuart tried to say Arnie's name one last time before he charged him with the shattered remnants of the game console and their friend's face in his hands. Wielding them with caveman rage.

He had to blast the planets out of him. He had to take the countless demon galaxies away. Destroy. For Payn. Payn promised. 

Promised him.

""Laydeees and gentlemen, fans of the Procedural Arts, and supplicants of the Great Seed: welcome to the main event! We are live from the sold-out Guildford Gardens, where the air is thick with the scent of unwashed hoodies and expensive coffee.

In the blue corner, wearing the pristine, unbranded tracksuit of total mystery, he is the undisputed champion of the 'No Comment,' the grandmaster of the mute button, and the man who hasn't tweeted since the last solar eclipse: THE COMMUNITY MANAGERRRRRRRR!

And in the red corner, with bloodshot eyes and a thumb permanently calloused from refreshing his browser, he is the challenger, the underdog, the man who thinks a CSS change is a personal message from God: THE SEVEN-HUNDRED-DAY SEEKER!""

# Round One: The Phantom Punch

""The bell rings and the Seeker comes out swinging! He leads with a sharp Refresh-Jab, followed quickly by a Data-Mining-Hook. He’s digging deep into the source code, folks. He’s looking for a file size, a hidden image, anything! But the Community Manager is just standing there. Look at that posture! He’s not even moving. He’s just staring into the middle distance, his hands behind his back.

The Seeker throws a heavy When-Release cross, but it passes right through the Champ like he’s made of fog. The Seeker is punching air, ladies and gentlemen! He’s putting all his weight into these queries, but the Champ is a vacuum. The silence in this arena is deafening, and every time the Seeker misses, he looks a little more tired, a little more hollow.""

# Round Two: The Rope-a-Dope of Silence

""We’re into the second round and the Seeker is getting desperate. He tries to initiate a clinch, shouting questions about procedural lichen and rabbit-folk anatomy into the Champ’s ear. But the Community Manager is perfectly still. It is the ultimate defense: the Rope-a-Dope of absolute nothingness.

The Seeker tries a False-Prophet-Haymaker, claiming he saw a leak on a Tuesday. The crowd goes wild with desperation! But wait: the Champ doesn't even blink. He doesn't confirm; he doesn't deny; he doesn't even breathe. The Seeker is back on the ropes, frantically scrolling through his feed, looking for a sign, a spark, or even a single pixel of movement. But there is nothing. Just a 404 error where his sanity used to be.""

# Round Three: The TKO of Boredom

""The Seeker is down! He’s on one knee, staring at a blurred screenshot of a mountain that might just be a smudge on his own monitor. The referee is starting the count. 

One! Two! Three! The Seeker is whispering about development epochs and revision releases.

Four! Five! Six! He’s reaching into his pocket for a python library, hoping it holds the power to summon a trailer! But his arm is too heavy. He’s exhausted by the lack of resistance!

Seven! Eight! Nine!

And at the very last second, the Community Manager finally leans over the ropes. The crowd leans in. The Seeker leans in. The world holds its breath, and the Champ... adjusts his glasses. He turns around, walks out of the ring, and turns off the lights.

The bell doesn't even ring! The Seeker is left in the dark, still waiting, still hungry, still entirely uninformed! There is no winner because there was no fight. There is only the silence of Guildford, and the long, long walk home.""

1qr4qst,https://www.reddit.com/r/screamingintothevoid/comments/1qr4qst/dextromethorphan/,Dextromethorphan,"They didn't go to school that day because there wasn't anything to learn there. There never was. So they never went. There was never anything to do there either, some cute skirts but they could see em after an all, so Jacob, Stuart and Arnie did what they did every schoolday. They ditched to smoke a few bowls in the 7/11 parking lot where the gutterpunks drank store brand mouthwash five-finger discounted from the Riteaid down the street. They would drink till their filthy bellies swelled. Gorged. Their stomachs while long battered and well worn would still nonetheless grow upset after a few hours of guzzling the swill and they would spew the aqua-green/blue regurgitant out in a geyser fountain. Projectile like a firehose. Total spray. When they did so it was always in a group, just like everything else they did, and as a result the whole dirty place would suddenly, briefly, smell of a minty-green wintery fresh wonderland that made the boys think and feel of cheap Christmas things. They loved it. Thought it was absolutely fucking hilarious. But also, in its own demented haphazard whitetrash way, magical. 

Dandy and Scrooloose didn't let the boys down. They blasted foaming green fluoride geysers out of their rotten drugged out homeless mouths and created a curiously pleasant miasma around the squalid little ghetto place. The trio laughed and cheefed their weed. Stuart went inside for snacks before they all departed for Arnie's house. His mother was never home. While inside the little fluorescent blasted place he'd grabbed something else as well. A surprise, for his other two cohorts. His friends. The gutterpunks had given him an idea.

…

Arnie's basement was any fifteen year old’s dream. Playstation and his own private TV. Refrigerator. Stereo. It was simple. But they were simple boys. Of simple upbringing. Blunt even, these boys, this truant three. Blunt instruments that lacked finer cogs and working moving parts within their child-savage skulls to better know and understand and differentiate what should not and what should be. 

What we should do. And what we should not. 

The bloodshed began with Stuart’s surprise. 

They were in the middle of a Smash Bros match, the other two, Jacob and Arnie, when he'd placed it on the small coffee table before them next to their little green bottles of Mountain Dew and cakes of Hostess bread and processed cream. 

Three bottles of cough syrup. Extra strength. One for each. And three boxes of extra strength Triple C’s. 

The other two looked at him like he was an idiot. Then laughed. But Stuart kept right on smiling. Unperturbed. 

Jacob chided him, “Oh, what're ya Lil Weezy or some shit now? You're fucking stupid, we have weed you fucking moron!"" 

“This ain't the same. This ain't like codeine shit. That's a narcotic. This shit has a chemical in it that makes you trip out. Like see shit an stuff."" 

Arnie made a face. Jacob just laid in once more. 

“What're you talking about?"" 

Stuart shrugged. His confident face and gaze faltered from the other two and drifted away, first to the right and then to the floor. 

“I dunno, it's supposed to be like acid or shrooms or something. I dunno."" 

“You didn't pay for alla this?"" asked Arnie. Implying it to be a waste. 

“It wasn't that much…"" Stuart was losing all confidence now. The ship was sinking fast and he wanted off. Regretted setting sail in the first place. What an idiot. 

Jacob started laughing then and Arnie followed after. 

Stuart got a little angry. More than a little flustered. Red in the face, he brought to the table an indisputable, irrefutable piece of proof. Something the other two fuckwads couldn't deny. 

“You guys are fucking dumb, you just don't know, my big brother and his friends do this shit all the time, they have hella fuckin fun, dumbasses.”

The other two stopped laughing. 

A beat. 

Holy shit. That changed everything. Stuart's big brother Cameron was like the coolest fucking guy, not just at school but like the whole fucking town. If he thought it was cool and he said it got you hella high an shit…

That changed everything. 

Not really knowing what they were doing and not really caring, it'd never stopped the three before, the boys tore into the packages. They divided the pills amongst themselves, each box had 48 pills each, they'd take the pills in a couple of handfuls and chase them down with the syrup. 

“I feel like this is gonna make me barf."" said Arnie, eyeing the pills and the black-green-blue bottle of store brand stuff in his other hand. He then eyed the other two. 

The other two boys eyed him back. 

They'd huffed engine enamel, coolant, spray paint, snorted kiddie speed, all in the pursuit of chasing down the hours and murdering the time. 

""C’mon, man. Don't be a pussy.” said Jacob. A smirk across his laconic teenage face. 

And with that the boys toasted, To Pussy!, and laughed and then threw back their handfuls and began to chug the thick dark liquid that would seal their shared three fates. 

Arnie called it. He puked almost immediately drenching his carpet and the table before him. The other two flipped him off and laughed and kept right at it, another handful and chugging guzzles. He flipped the fuckers right back in return. Assholes. 

Then the last handful each. The last of their bottles too. Jacob and Stuart had worked quick. But they both had to admit, they did honestly feel really sick. 

They sat there in silence, a moment or two. Awhile. The minutes rolled past as they waited for whatever the hell was supposed to happen to start happening. 

“This shit better actually work. I think I might follow Arnie ‘fore not too long."" 

“It takes a second, stupid. You have to let it hit your stomach and then your blood."" 

“How long ya gotta wait?"" Jacob was no longer in love with this idea. 

“I dunno, maybe like another hour or two or something. Just wait, dude it's gonna be hella fun."" 

Arnie, still toweling up his syrupy green vomit, just looked at them pitifully. Left out. 

“You guys still ain't feelin it?"" 

Stuart and Jacob shook their heads slowly, a little nauseous each. 

No. Nothing. 

“You guys are jerks, you could at least help ME EWMzzMzzzzMMMM zzzzzZTTzzME me Me ME!!!!

ME 

MM

EM

MMME

ME

Me

The body that Stuart used to inhabit fell out and far and away from him. He drifted out drunkenly and gelatinous as Arnie's face turned to twisted misshapen malformed bats and screaming yellow things, bugs out the eyes and mosquitoes out his ears. Squirming writhing black worms and creatures. He tried to scream but it merely bubbled inside him. He wanted back. He wanted back in the familiar meatsack thing!

And then he was but the floor was shifting purple that was sometimes liquid and the TV was just a giant wet lidless eye. Red. Irritated and tearing and needing something from him, but he couldn’t figure what. The basement around him had been replaced with voiding space that had something swimming in it unseen but seeing him. 

Stuart looked to the eye. The lidless glistening swelled organ. What do you want from me?

I miss when there was Smash Bros on this thing…

“It's alright, kid. Ya get used to it. You're kwisatz haderachian. You'll see. You'll see."" 

Stuart turned to look as the world around him suddenly bled lurid crimson. A wound had been opened up in this time and space. 

He looked like a horrendous cross between little green Dagobah Yoda and the sneering bastardly unclean Lamisil goblin-thing. Flesh a terrible pus-color mixture and dried out and dead in places while loose and scrotal in other stretchy taffy-like patches. Pustules and pores that smelled and oozed of cheese were all about his wretched form. Slovenly he was draped upon the couch beside Stuart. Breathing and seething terrible audible gurgled mucus laden throaty breaths and absolutely reeking of European vinegar and cream. His eyes were wide glistening globes filled with rancid old hobo’s desperate angry piss. Shot through with lines of red that made junkies drool and sing. 

It splayed out a clawing hand to the child, fingers webbed and dripping with thick globs of dumpster jelly. Corpse butter. It forked out the peace sign at em. Like a hippy. 

“‘Sup, kid? How's it hangin?” And then a little less friendly, ""Who sent cha?”

""What?” said Stuart. 

""Just messin with ya. How're ya feeling?”

A beat. 

""I'm a little bit scared.”

""That's alright, bud. You should be.”

A beat. The wound of the world all around them now bled deeper and more freely. 

Another, more blood, this world filled and drank it all in scenic and in crash-loop swirls. Hypnotic. And with urgent voracious greed. It rapidly danced all above them. The eye still watched them in place of the TV. 

""I think I wanna be done with this now.”

Payn, Yoda of the foulest swamp in unimagined Hells, just smiled and tilted his head. His teeth green and glossy with translucent slime and swimming with tiny leeching things. 

""I wanna go back to my friends and home now.” A beat. And then much smaller and more pitifully, ""please..”

""Nah, ya don't need those retards! Look, man.” He pointed out to the bleeding space as something like a fly without wings crawled out of one of his large goblin ears, ""Look, little Hitler. Look, man. I compel you, you little fucking slave!"" 

And he did look out into the bleeding space now transforming into a blood soaked saturated mess rendition of Arnie's precious basement… but it didn't stop shifting and bleeding and changing then, swirling gore mixture world, a sinew hypno swirl spin of familiar things and objects and blood and muscle tissue and organ meat. Meat. 

Meat. 

But then this too began to break down. 

Into countless…

countless…

Countless trillions upon trillions of spinning dancing demon planets that made up everything. 

They fought a Star Wars dogfight before his eyes, the trillions upon trillions of little demon planets. And flying daredevil amongst them all, SQUADRON X. Blasting and making short work of so many of the near countless twirling mad demonic molecular things. They make up everything these spinning dancing demon planets. Rocketing and maneuvering with such blinding speed that they betrayed us all the illusion of a solid. None of us are whole and solid. All of us are bastard conglomerates of little whirling demon things. Lucifer. Evil. None of us are solid or whole and all of us are made of spinning devil moons. Microscopic. Wicked dots colored and shooting colored things. Violent. Evil. Lucifer. Made of the devil. Not whole or solid at all. Only dancing illusion. Only fabricated reality. Only dancing. Only fabric. 

Arnie jumped back and shrieked as Stuart bolted to the PlayStation, ripped it from the small stand next to the television and bounded back over and began to bash in Jacob's foaming mouth and seizing face. Crushing and destroying both in violent blasting heaving strikes that shot plastic and teeth and blood and shredded boy-face and flesh out in terrible vivid sprays. 

Jacob's legs danced and jigged and shuddered unnaturally as Stuart screamed and continued to blast his dying friend’s shattering face with more and more heavier and heavier blows. All the while shrieking at the top of his young lungs,

“The trillions of little demon things! The trillions of little demon things! Payn told me! Payn told me and showed me! THE LITTLE FUCKING DEMON THINGS!!”

Arnie watched his mad friend godroar and decimate their friend Jacob's ruined mashed face and skull. He didn't understand. He was so fucking scared. Completely locked and terrified. Cold. One moment Stuart went completely white and silent, then Jacob had started having a seizure or some shit. Flopping and dying on the floor of his basement like some fish. Now this. 

Now this. 

He didn't know what the fuck to do. He distantly felt the crotch of his pants grow warm as he pissed his pants absentmindedly and watched one best friend beat the other one to death. Screaming. Screaming something that didn't make any sense. 

Arnie was praying for his mother to come home and find him and save him and maybe poor Jacob too, to stop Stuart, please… when he suddenly stopped pounding Jacob's brains into the soaked and blood-drinking carpet of the basement floor and turned to look at him with wet glistening red eyes. Eyes that were filled with blind animal rage. Madness. 

Stuart tried to say Arnie's name one last time before he charged him with the shattered remnants of the game console and their friend's face in his hands. Wielding them with caveman rage.

He had to blast the planets out of him. He had to take the countless demon galaxies away. Destroy. For Payn. Payn promised.

I sold so much of my stuff to get out after she decided I wasn’t useful enough

Certain collections I spent years building and it still wasn’t enough

I spent 3k maintenance on a vehicle 

The mechanic slipped up and the vehicles engine got completed fucked on the trip, coolant leaked where it shouldn’t have because he broke something during maintenance 

Went on a long distance trip I budgeted for

The 3k was gone 

Another 2k to find out what was wrong with it 

Only to be told I better find somewhere to dump it because the vehicle would be more expensive dive to fix than buy a new one, but I just spent so much money to try and fix it 

Trying to drive it to a new city in the dark to donate it because it was the only way to get rid of it 

So much money wasted 

So much time 

I got my mom so many gifts thinking she cared about me, I was taking care of her- her being disabled but because at some point me paying 4 to then 2 times the market going for a rent a room in the area wasn’t enough for her to keep me around, on top of doing all the cooking and cleaning, taking care of her three dogs and mine, helping pay for car maintenance 

A room to rent where we lived with its own bathroom went for 500 

I paid 2500 for almost a year with limited bathroom access

And a minimum of 1200 plus any maintenance related stuff like vehicle or pet food stuff when I went on workman’s comp after months of fighting about me paying too much 

Anytime I had savings as she monitored my mail and purchases, she’d make up an excuse and demand money from me 

I hate my mother

She guilted me into staying saying she needed me to take care of her and her autoimmune disease related problems, reminding me my dad “abandoned” her over them, no they are both just bad people

But then I got hurt at work, the job she demanded I do that I was dependent on her for getting to, over forty minutes one way

Fights every morning about how early she had to wake up to drop me off at my 12.5 hour shifts 

But she wanted me to make more than 20 an hour straight out of high school since my dad left so she could get coffee every day and eat out multiple times a week

Here I am trying to build credit I didn’t have a chance to before 

Im 22 and so far behind 

My entire family sucks

I can’t afford groceries without payment plans

1qr4nnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1qr4nnq/the_milleniaold_question_how_can_oppositesex/,The millenia-old question: How can opposite-sex friendships stay only platonic?,"Interesting subject, I'm curious about how men here feel about this and women you're welcome to comment too! Everybody is invited to discuss. Please keep this thread civilized.

(Please keep in mind this isn't an absolute philosophy, it's just my opinion given my life experience. my opinion isn't better than anyone else's).

I see people talk about this all the time, they ask ""can men and women be friends?"", among other similar questions... so, can they? 
That's a devisive subject people like to call  ""controversial"" nowadays, some hate this question surprisingly.
""It's so obvious, of course you can be friends! Just stop thinking with your dick!""..

Men and women can be friends of course, because that's the wrong question to ask.

Can heterossexual, opposite-sex close friendships survive without someone catching feelings for the other? Maybe, but I don't recommend it because it's extremely unlikely.

See, I am a man with life experience and do have female friends, they're more like acquaintances, low-mantenance friendships where we only stay surface level.
They're wives of my mates, I can hang out with them in group settings without an issue, sure, or long-term female friends I call once a month to know how they're doing.
Work/gym/business oriented meetings, those are acquaintances not close friendships.

I do not intend of having a **close** female friend unless I'm looking to date her. Why? Because that's the natural progression of a healthy relationship, so why wouldn't I like her that way at some point?
Strangers -> acquaintances -> friends -> good friends -> best friends -> lovers.

Biologically speaking, the numbers don't lie, men have more testosterone and our ""monkey-brain"" is telling us to bring forth the human race all the time, testosterone makes us hornier, no wonder a testosterone shot help women a lot with their low libido!

Women are okay with emotional connection without sex, men aren't. So when connection is there without the sex we're expecting the full package. It's that simple!

I have a close connection with my sister, she's my only close female friend other than my wife. And out of respect to my wife, I'm not meeting females 1one1, not because i can't keep my dick in my pants but to bring transparency into the relationship.

Last thing I want is to bring stress into my life by having ""a female friend my wife shouldn't worry about"".
And I demand respect from other dudes when I'm in a committed relationship, so I also expect the same from her.

Of course she will worry, because she knows how women are, just like men understand men better.
A lot of women enjoy the attention from ""guy friends"", creating an emotional bond (women love attention more than sex in average) this makes her content, she friendzones the guy knowing he's got blueballs and would sleep with her at any given opportunity. That's not a friendship, that's courship from him and ungenuity from her, both are lying to themselves.
It can also happen that women are also oblivious/naive about this but this fits mostly young women/teenager/post teenager, a lot of them know specially the older they are. 

Most of the time it's platonic from the woman side but I wonder how much of that isn't borderline emotional cheating. Think with me: a comitted woman has a best guy friend whom she has deep talks with. She tells him about her deepest fears, hopes and dreams and sometimes even talks about her man/her relationship with this guy. They're basically boyfriend and girlfriend without calling it so.
But she enjoys it because she attained her ultimate goal: attention/emotional bonding.

The guy has it worse because he doesn't attain his ultimate goal: sex.
But he's patient and keeps on going in hopes he can sleep with her in the future, even when he doesn't wanna admit it. He's so nice! Shower her with compliments, bring gifts, is readily available to fix her car or help her move. The nice guy in waiting.

I learned long ago: I can't be **good** friends with women I find attractive/hot.
Can I be friends? Yes sure, I can leave it at a very low-effort friendship.
If I keep on seeing her 1on1, night drink at a bar, cinema, find common ground, etc.. sex always gets in the way at some point because monkey brain starts acting up ""this fine woman can help bring your genes forward"".
I got an emotional attachment with her? And she's also hot? of course I want more, our brain is just wired that way.

I know this will come eventually, not because I chose to in the beginning, but because it naturally happens eventually. 

Many people demonize men for this. Listen, not everything is about primal instincts I know, we are intellectual beings. But why would I be close friends with a hot female if I keep thinking about sex with her? I have better stuff to do than entertaining this ""friendship"". I have much more fun and things in common with guys anyway, no offense but with guys I can be definitely 100% platonic, we play videogames together, play basketball, go boxing, watch football. We can say ""fuck you"" to each other and laugh so hard our belly hurts.

That is for me and true platonic friendship.
I can be good friends with women if they're family, or they're old like and treat me like she's my grandma, or I have NO attraction whatsoever. But unfortunately many times in that situation the girl tries to have it with me.

My female friends are surface level friendships, whom I see in group dynamics or occasionally have a coffee during the day, which I always insist in inviting my woman to, and I make sure to ask them how their husband is doing. I make sure in being bros with my female friends' boyfriends to make sure they know I'm not a threat, that's also important.

My female friends need to be friends with the couple, either that or nothing at all.
And I expect the same from her male friends.

Opposite-sex friendships of this kind is something new in human history, it was never like that before. My dad would never hang out alone with a female, neither my mom would do that with a man.
Casual hookups made this possible, and it made everything all that more confusing.

Is the title of this post possible? Yes, but boundaries and knowledge of opposite-sex friendships' psychology are both necessary for healthy, genuine relationships.
This results in a better life with your partner, a better marriage.

i live in a building that shares a porch with a coffee shop, so my porch is easily accessible, open all day everyday, and i mark this as my safe place (each flat literally has a delivery box right there).

every single time, my parcel is delivered to a building two streets away. this building is residents access only, so believe it or not, i cant access it! they don’t even ring my buzzer to try delivering to me, nor do they ever leave it in my safe place. it just gets dumped in a building i have no access to. 

the infuriating thing is i go downstairs, and what is crowding my porch? parcels delivered by evri for the building that my parcel was delivered to!! (and every other damn building on the street)

theres no reception at this building, so i have to stand there aimlessly trying to get buzzed into the building by the residents. most of them don’t answer, and those who do, tend to just hang up on me. understandable, its not their job, and why would they allow access to their building to a stranger? but now my parcel has been marked as delivered and evri’s job is done, but i have literally no way of receiving it

i spent half an hour on me and my gf’s anniversary trying to buzz any of the residents to let me in to get my gf’s present from their porch. really put a downer on the evening

i added a note to my safe space specifically saying to not deliver to a neighbour, and now in the delivery note it just says ‘we’ve delivered to your porch’ even when they havent

why do big companies use them, and why don’t i even have the option to choose a different courier? i would pay so much more to use literally anyone else",2,1769777611.0,Evri,2,1.0,False

[US to seek rare earth price mechanism during meetings with allies, official says - MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/web/us-to-seek-rare-earth-price-mechanism-during-meetings-with-allies-official-says/)

[Under Secretary of State Jacob Helberg. Credit: Jacob Helberg | X](https://preview.redd.it/s8cqhteqehgg1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a01f4b835cbd1ad52b9fdf1417a7d5344b34dea)

The US will seek to reach consensus with allies on a pricing mechanism to help insulate rare earth mineral refiners and extractors during meetings with dozens of foreign ministers in Washington next week, a senior Trump administration official said.

In an interview with *Bloomberg News* on Thursday, US Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Jacob Helberg said he expects a lot of “momentum and excitement” toward “agreeing on a pricing mechanism that we can all coordinate together on in order to ensure price stability for people in the mineral refining and extraction business.”

Helberg said those talks would be a “central pillar” of next week’s summit and called a pricing mechanism “the key unlock” to securing rare earths supply in the face of historic price undercutting by Chinese producers. Access to rare earths has been an area of growing concern since China imposed an export licensing regime last year that threatened to cut off access to the materials.

Asked for details on the pricing mechanism, Helberg deferred to the White House and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who he said could offer a fuller explanation of how it would work.

“The key is getting other countries to sign on,” Helberg said. “We’ll definitely make a full-court press.”

Though tariffs have long been a preferred US trade policy tool, China’s chokehold over rare earths creates challenges as low-priced minerals can be sold to foreign countries even when the US imposes levies. To erode China’s dominance, other nations would essentially need to create a market that excludes China and gives producers enough of a guarantee that they won’t be undercut and find themselves without customers willing to pay market prices.

In an effort to bolster a rare earths supply chain outside of China, the US since last year has announced a series of government investments in mining and refining companies, including MP Materials Corp., Vulcan Metals and Lithium Americas Corp. This week, the Commerce Department signed [a non-binding agreement with USA Rare Earth Inc.](https://www.mining.com/usa-rare-earth-surges-on-1-6b-govt-funding-loi/) for $1.6 billion in US funding.

A proclamation from President Donald Trump on rare earths earlier this month makes clear that the US would [consider price floors for trade in critical minerals](https://www.mining.com/web/us-moves-away-from-critical-mineral-price-floors/), including possible “minimum import prices” for specific materials and potential tariffs in the future to mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities.

Trump is holding the tool in reserve for now, but he could impose tariffs on critical minerals from countries whose supplies are priced artificially low, effectively raising the cost of those imports to a level that would sustain production entering the US from other nations, a person familiar with the approach said.

The tactic is similar to the duties imposed in connection with conventional anti-dumping and anti-subsidization trade cases — where final levies generally are calibrated to counteract subsidies and artificially low prices from foreign suppliers and instead buttress domestic producers. Potential tariffs on some countries could bolster — and create an effective price floor for — other foreign critical mineral suppliers instead.

Nick Iacovella, executive vice president of the Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group that supports domestic manufacturing, applauded Trump’s proclamation. “This approach gives American manufacturers the confidence they need to invest, expand and rebuild critical supply chains here at home,” he said by email.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

# Opinion:📜 Reuters, Article 232, and the So-Called “Backing Away From Price Supports”

I am calling the article below out along with many others **— let’s be precise.**

[Exclusive: US moves away from critical mineral price floors, sources say | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-moves-away-critical-mineral-price-floors-sources-say-2026-01-28/)

# What Reuters initially implied:

**The U.S. is stepping back from price supports for critical minerals.**

https://preview.redd.it/2ie00ozaihgg1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=5887d92036d4689a138c247d40badc560928cd68

# What they walked back and edited:

The U.S. may/will instead use **Article 232 trade authority** and national security tools moving forward.

Those are **not equivalent**, and the edit matters!

# 🧠 IMHO~ Why This Was Effectively a Hit Piece

**Markets heard:**

* **“No price floors”**
* **“No guarantees”**
* **“Critical minerals exposed”**

**But Article 232 + DPA + Title III do not rely on price supports.**  
**They rely on:**

* **Guaranteed offtakes**
* **Preferred procurement**
* **Domestic sourcing mandates**
* **Capital cost sharing**
* **Strategic equity stakes**

***In other words: EXACTLY WHAT NIOCORP MANAGEMENT IS BUILDING!!!***

**That demand certainty beats price supports.**

*The article hit anything labeled “critical minerals” indiscriminately — miners, processors, recyclers — without distinguishing who is embedded in government-backed ecosystems versus who is not.*

That’s why the selling was broad, fast, **and dumb!**

# 🧩 Why This Actually Favors NioCorp (The Quiet part Out loud...)

**NioCorp is not waiting for:**

* Spot price subsidies for certain critical minerals

**NioCorp is aligning with:**

* Defense demand (Lockheed/DPA/DoW/OEMS & more...)
* Domestic supply mandates
* Alloy-level integration
* Platform & Component pull-through

\*\*\*\*\*Article 232-style policy **rewards exactly that behavior**. \*\*\*MARK STATED THEY ARE MEETING IN D.C. NOW!!\*\*\*\*

[\#NIOCORP\~ Washington, D.C. Accelerating Investment in U.S. Critical Minerals Projects (Video & Transcript), plus a bit more ...(Two-fer-Tuesday) : r/NIOCORP\_MINE](https://www.reddit.com/r/NIOCORP_MINE/comments/1qooc0b/niocorp_washington_dc_accelerating_investment_in/)

So, while the market **puked**, the **policy trajectory didn’t change** — only the headline framing did.

# 🏁 Clean Takeaway (No Trading Baloney, Just Reality)

* Niocorp's \~ February ScAl reveal **signals demand creation (Creates & Justifies a market at scale & offtakes/JV/Anchors follow) =** INBOUND **DEMAND CERTAINTY for Scandium & ScAl alloy at SCALE.**
* March Final DFS **anchors all production supply certainty & metrics for all Seven Critical Minerals & Project Economics & Engineering across the board!**
* Government involvement is happening ""*between the lines""*, not in press releases **(THINK FOLLOW ON 232 Procurements & Offtakes at fixed pricing? & EXIM- FID)**
* **Reuters conflated the tools — and spooked the entire herd!**
* The Strategic materials NioCorp will produce don’t need price supports if they have **platform-backed demand like NioCorp's Elk Creek mine is building & will soon prove. (""If they do get some...it's icing on the cake!"")**

This is not chaos.  
It’s **policy + industrial sequencing** & **NioCorp executing on their plan.**

# 📌 In Plain Terms:

**What investors need to understand point blank:**  
**NioCorp management has never structured Elk Creek as a single-commodity price-floor-dependent project!**

As Mark Smith has repeatedly emphasized in recent (RedChip & Crux) presentations, the economic strength of Elk Creek comes from **multiple independent revenue streams** — Niobium, Scandium, Titanium, and Rare Earths — plus the emerging **downstream ScAl alloy opportunity**.

**That diversification is intentional &** **it means the project’s viability does not hinge on NdPr pricing alone, nor on government guarantees!!!** In fact, the upcoming DFS update is specifically designed to reflect realistic, stand alone, financeable economics.

***The market sold the sector broadly; the fundamentals for NioCorp did not change!!***

# 🛡️ MEANWHILE: NioCorp Is Building some U.S. Critical Mineral Backbone: February 2026 ScAl Reveal → March DFS → EXIM FID

NioCorp’s 2026 story is no longer about proving a metal — it’s about **executing a vertically integrated U.S. critical-minerals strategy** aligned with defense, aerospace, and advanced manufacturing priorities. The upcoming **February Scandium-Aluminum (ScAl) alloy reveal** signals that Elk Creek is being positioned as the **anchor supply** for a full mine-to-manufacturing ecosystem, not a standalone mining operation.

The February 2026 ScAl reveal is expected to highlight **manufacturing-ready alloys**, developed through NioCorp’s NAMA and FEA-driven IP alongside DoD labs, defense primes (including Lockheed), and advanced manufacturers such as IBC, Nanoscale, Creative Engineers, Project Pivot, 3-D additive manufacturing & other partners. The focus is on **repeatability, qualification, and cost control**, enabling ScAl alloys to move directly into real components and platforms.

This sets up the **March final DFS**, which locks in Elk Creek as a **Seven-critical-minerals hub** supplying niobium, scandium, titanium, rare earths, and associated downstream products. Importantly, management has stated in recent RedChip and CRUX transcripts that **the Elk Creek DFS does** ***not*** **rely on government price supports to be viable**. Price supports would be additive, not foundational — a sign of project strength, not dependency.

That distinction matters. The DFS is designed to stand on **engineering, metallurgy, and integration**, not policy favors. \*\*\*\***Government tools such as Title III, Article 232, or EXIM participation enhance speed and scale, but they are not prerequisites for the economic viability of the project. — a point Mark Smith has been explicit about.\*\*\*\*\***

The sequencing also matters: **alloy and manufacturing validation first, mine economics second, financing third**. This mirrors how every successful U.S. strategic material — from titanium in the 1950's to rare earth magnets — actually scaled. **February establishes downstream pull-through**; March finalizes upstream certainty.

As Mark Smith has consistently stated, the goal is an **EXIM Bank Final Investment Decision by mid-2026**. EXIM doesn’t finance concepts — it finances de-risked projects with credible downstream integration. The February ScAl reveal plus the March final DFS form that exact foundation.

**Bottom line:** NioCorp is executing a **vertically integrated, seven-critical-minerals U.S. supply strategy** that stands on its own economics, with policy support as an accelerator — not a crutch. February and March are the bridge from validation to funding, and mid-2026 is where the capital locks in for complete Build out.

# NioCorp's Elk Creek Mine is being Built!

While the market plays games with headlines and algos, **NioCorp is completing all the old-school hard work** right now — engineering, qualifying alloys, locking partners, de-risking the mine, and lining up final EXIM FID financing. The share-price noise is pure **bullshit imho**: & reflects trading mechanics, not fundamentals. NioCorp isn’t selling a story or chasing momentum — it’s **building U.S. infrastructure**. And history is clear: markets forget the noise, but they remember who actually got it done.

# — And Why It’s All About to Change

Because the **work is now visible (Dual Ramp Construction starting any day now..)**

Then February puts ScAl alloys and manufacturing & offtakes etc... on the table. March locks the mine with a final DFS. **Mid-2026 targets EXIM FID.** At that point, this stops being a “future story” and becomes an **executing industrial project** with partners, timelines, and the capital behind it.

Markets can play games when outcomes are vague — they can’t when milestones stack and financing follows. The noise fades when reality shows up, and **NioCorp is about to move from being debated to being fully funded**!

***""Better to be early than late!""....***

My friends offered to let me stay at their place, but they're LOUD. I work nights, and I needed somewhere quiet to sleep during the day. I'm staying at a hotel for 8 nights in a row.

When I first got to the hotel, I talked to the front desk guy and told him my situation. I basically said I sleep from 9am-5pm so if there are cleaners coming in I need them to come in ANY time outside of those times. He wrote it down and was on his phone for like 45 seconds. He told me to make sure I've got the sign on the door handle that asks for service. 

The 2nd morning, I put the sign out on the door handle asking for cleaning. She arrived at 8:18am and cleaned insanely fast. Gave me new towels, new coffee, made the bed, etc. In record time. I'm thinking - Great, they got the memo. This is fantastic. Then I put the do not disturb sign on my door and went to sleep. 

Then 2 days later I put the sign up again at around 6am. Eventually 9am arrives and I see the cleaners carts out there but she's on the opposite side of the building. Well crap. Anyway at around 9:45am she still wasn't there so I went to sleep. Eventually she showed up to clean at 12:20pm. She woke me up and I went out, let her clean while I was grogged as hell in the hallway couch in front of the elevators. 

I could NOT get back to sleep after she left. 

I called the front desk this morning asking if they could make sure to come only before 9am or after 5pm. He said he'd write that down.

Am I asking too much here? Is this an unreasonable request?

Also, I haven't been tipping. Am I an ass?

So far they've cleaned my room twice. Honestly just didn't even think of it. It never even crossed my mind until now. I just went to an ATM this morning to get cash. They only give out $20 bills. I thought I'd leave a $10 but $20 is a lot..

1qr4hjy,https://i.redd.it/knebz5c4ghgg1.jpeg,TIKTOK SCAMMER,"Hi, so I made a very stupid mistake. 
For context, I tried ordering and buying a GCash Vendo from a Tiktok seller called V Corporation. I thought the owner was legit since upon searching, no complains of scams were posted against this seller. I paid 15k in full for the machine.

So this is the part where I was really stupid. He ask for my gcash to ""set up"" the machine. Hinihingi nya yung bank account or gcash ko and being skeptic, I just gave the person access to my gcash. So eto na, he said kailangan daw ng pondo at least 20k sa gcash ko kasi dun mag babawas pag may gumamit ng machine. So nilagyan ko just 20k. Lo and behold naubos yung 20k in just 5 mins, sabi nya nag error daw etc, so he asked for another 20k, I called him out then the person blocked me.

Now I know di masyadong malaki yung 35k para sa iba pero medjo kumirot lng dibdib ko sa ginawa ko. Good thing I just use gcash to pay my spotify and netflix accounts. 

Now, I don't expect for that money to come back pero if may marunong/alam kung pano possible mabawi ang pera, please do message me. I'll be happy to give you half of that amount.

I'm based in Florida and so I was looking at many importers that have many warehouses in Jacksonville. However I they have premium priced green beans (no lowers than $4.80 per lb).  I do have purchasing power to purchase at least 10 bags. Obviously was looking at local importers to save cost on shipping. I have two questions for you guys

1. I've been hearing that I'm lowering my quality because I'm looking for commercial grade, but my argument is that I specialize in blends and so the blends I use kind of complete each other, Am I going about this the wrong way? Also what commercial grade importers would you guys suggest I should look into if so?

2. Seeing that these importers probably won't be close to my state (Florida) and so I may have to pay for shipping, would it be worth it to buy commercial grade and pay for shipping or would it be pretty much the same but better quality if I buy from one of these specialty importers and do a pickup (Drive to the warehouse is about 3 hours)",2,1769777142.0,coffee_roasters,5,1.0,False

We live in walking distance from one another so we’re together a lot. My sister is single without kids whereas I am married to my husband (33M) with three kids. My husband and I have been married since out of high school and my family and his family is pretty meshed; everyone gets along well and spends times with each other. I hang out with his sister (25F) a lot too since we all live in a tight knit community. 

Here’s my dilemma. As I’ve said, we hang out a lot so my sister has a spare key to my house that she’ll use whenever. Sometimes she’ll come over without letting me know, which I don’t mind but, at times, my husband has complained about. So I’ve told her that she has to announce when she’s stopping by. But more often than not, my sister will come over on the weekends and she will basically stay all weekend to hang out with us and she will sleep in our guest room until she goes home after the weekend is over. Which my husband and I have no problem with. She is a night owl so she will stay up all night whereas I go to bed around 9 pm even on the weekends so normally she will be up watching tv or movies and my husband will be up as well. Sometimes he’ll play call of duty in the game room but most times he’s up and they will watch movies and tv shows together. They have a lot of the same interests.  

Recently during Christmas, I noticed that he got her very thoughtful gifts; i.e. an engraved gift and things that are particular to her interests which I thought was nice but overkill. Now suddenly she’s been texting him about going on a “coffee shop tour” since they both enjoy different coffees. And for the past two weekends, he’s told me like last minute that they’re going to a different coffee shop to get coffee.

Honestly, idk what is happening. I sleep late and I feel like the same day has been repeating non stop, the same 24 hours just in a loop and the only thing making me smile, sad, stressed, angry or disappointed is this girl. I really don’t understand why. I’m not sure if she into me or not but for some reason I’m really into her. Long ago I looked at her just like I would’ve looked at anybody, no attraction, no looks just passing by. But for some reason ever since she followed me back, it’s been instant attraction. I wiped it away saying yea it’s just another pretty looking girl, but for some reason she goes on and follows me on the next app and suddenly she adds me on Snapchat. At that moment I’m confused, I’m lost. Lost? Cause I don’t think anyone like her would have any type of attraction towards me, but again I wiped it away saying it’s probably just for connections and fun. Later that day she snapped me and I still remember that snap, a nice clean looking apartment cream/white couch, a nice double circular table? With a candle and a book or 2? Something like that. I swiped it away and sent one of my living room, a half messy, decorated with a card collection and a few hype supreme items. All that time in my head it was just thoughts on why am I getting snapped? Idk. That was 10 days ago and I can’t sleep, it’s 4am and ive asked her out for coffee. I didn’t like the answer I got… “coffee? Where?” Sure it’s a neutral response but I was hoping for better. I replied “mamie, a nice cafe near the parliament”… she replied with “never heard of it”. Hmm does she want me to lead more? Is this a way to avoid giving a straight no? Is she shy and doesn’t want to show anything? Or am I just another pawn in the entertainment loop? I must be… every time I open to check her snap score… ugh the snap score, I don’t wanna talk about it. But see idk what I should’ve replied with? Should I have even replied? Should I have taken the L and moved on? Wellll I didn’t , I replied “ yea it’s a nice little cafe with nice drinks” “I’m open if you have an another favorite coffee shop”. That was sent 2 hours ago… she must’ve slept. Did she? Yea she did. But there goes my brain spinning again. It’s saying it’s fine she’ll reply by tomorrow maybe rejecting me or totally airing the snap, maybe she’d just say yes, idk… but isn’t it awkward by the next morning? Did I shoot too early… I must’ve idk. But wait, if there was any attraction, wouldn’t she wait to respond? Or did she need time to think about it? Maybe she was super tired? Or maybe I’m just not as important to her? Hmmm So I must’ve been another entertainment pawn I guess… funny. I just don’t seem to understand anything. I try to be super respectful and nice but then I get thrown under the bus, I think to myself I need to be a bit flirtatious a bit naughty maybe? I move to the next after time, I become weird? I’m hitting on her, I’m flirting, I’m telling her all about the stuff that these girls would want to hear, I tell her how her make up would be smudged all over her face as she moans deep, she asks me to put her back in her place with a slap or two. But by the end of the night I look myself in the mirror and that’s just not me…I was never raised like that… forget about being raised or whatever, it just feels soulless if that makes sense, I do not know anything about this women and we’re talking all that madness. I pull away from her too, I’ve left her on seen for weeks and I feel guilty? Fuck that we move. And then this one pulls up out of no where, I talk to her with respect, I flirt with caution to see the reactions, I complement her, I laugh at her team choices, we talk about stuff, she doesn’t drink she doesn’t smoke. She seems perfect. But again I remember the snap score increasing by 200-300 a day? Idk I must be another entertainment pawn. Huh how funny life is. You try and try and you get hit but wait not really? It seems like I’m the only one that gets hit you know, I keep getting hit so hard to a point where my best friend tells me “ life to you was never meant to be easy bro, you’ve been through shit and guess what? You’ll keep getting more shit” I thought and stayed silent and thought again, someone noticed? I thought everyone went through the same shit as me but stayed silent. I guess not… and I’m not talking about girls here, I’m talking about life in general, but that’s for another time. I really don’t know where I’m going with this but this girl mannn. Ahhh I forgot, she even made a shared playlist for us to add songs to once a day and rate them. Isn’t that mad? When you just got to talk to someone? She even asked me to name the playlist and said I wanna see what you name it and my dunbass named “for our late nights✨” and she loved it apparently lol. Ahh and don’t let me forget the time we passed by each other at the entrance of my building, when she blushed so hard and smiled like crazy when she saw me and I just hit her with a super nonchalant “hey how you doing” lol and the crazy part I don’t even remember if she said anything cause my heart was racing. I got back home and snapped her saying “ you looked really good when you passed by” and she responded saying “ ahaha thanks (some weird emoji) idk why I smiled so hard (another weird emoji) I didn’t expect to see you”… idk can someone fake facial emotion that fast and that well? Idk honestly but I really do hope this works out somehow… but at the same time if it doesn’t… if it doesn’t imma just lock in even more and be better I guess? Idk…. I really don’t know anymore. What more can I do to find someone for me. Fuck that emotional bs. It’s 4:33 and I’m tired, tired mentally more than anything and I STILL CANT SLEEP. I thought this would help, I guess it didn’t.

1qr4dou,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1qr4dou/need_advice/,Need advice,"My husband has narcissistic traits. For about two years he was in a malignant phase, and over the past year he’s shifted into a more typical grandiose state. He is noticeably more pleasant now, but he still maintains control over most aspects of our lives.

We both work, but he earns more, and as a result his career has always taken priority over mine. Because of that, I wake up at 5:30 a.m. every school day to take the kids to school. Out of roughly 100 school mornings this year, he has taken them only about five times.

On the rare mornings he gets up early, he often decides at the last minute that he will take them—after I’m already awake, dressed, and ready to go. When he decides he wants to do something, it has to be done his way. What frustrates me most is that he has never once proactively offered to take the kids so I could sleep in. He only takes them when it suits him and when he is already awake.

This morning, after I had already had coffee and started getting ready, he came into the kitchen and announced that he was going to take the kids. I told him I had already planned to take them, and that if he wants to do morning drop-off, I would appreciate knowing the night before so I could actually rest. He became irritated and told me to go back to bed. I explained that it was too late—I was already awake—and that I wanted to follow through with the plan I had made.

He was visibly annoyed, but he didn’t explode, which is progress. However, I anticipate that when I return home, he will be angry. In the past, he has framed situations like this as me being selfish or ungrateful, saying that I should have appreciated his “offer” and that I took away his chance to enjoy time with the kids.

What I struggle with most is the lack of control. The mornings feel governed by his impulses, and when I calmly assert my boundaries, it often leads to punishment or anger. I want to communicate that my issue is not about preventing him from helping—it’s about consistency, respect, and not having control exercised only when it benefits him.

It made sense at the time everything feels closer, lots of food options, viewpoints nearby.

This time, though, I stayed on the Virajpet side instead, and the difference was more noticeable than I expected.

Madikeri felt convenient but busy. Traffic near viewpoints, crowds during peak hours, and a general rush. Virajpet felt slower. Mornings were quiet, more open land, coffee plantations instead of roads, and evenings without noise.

I realised it really comes down to what kind of trip you want. If your plan is to cover as many spots as possible quickly, staying near Madikeri probably works better. But if the goal is to relax, sit around, take walks, and not feel rushed, staying a bit away from town made the trip feel more “Coorg-like” to me.

While planning, I came across this write-up about quieter stay areas in Coorg that helped me understand the location difference better (sharing only as a reference):

Nearly 15 years ago, the Australian Institute of Sport opened the European Training Centre in Gavirate, about an hour’s drive from Milan.

With a fully equipped gym as well as a games room with a pool table, it offers a base to train and relax for the 3,000 Australian athletes traveling through Europe in any given year.

“It was a strategic vision because we knew that Australian athletes, one of the biggest troubles for them was the tyranny of distance of traveling” the center’s director, Fiona de Jong, told The Associated Press.

“So 24-hour flight to Europe from Australia means that you can’t do that time and time again if you’re trying to compete at the highest level. It was our answer to our unique problem as a sporting country.”

The AIS has turned the center into a little slice of Australia right from the moment athletes arrive at the facility.

I can never zip it up which has caused disasters at times (things falling out and breaking/opening). 

Sooooo with the new drop coming…….. and coffee being quite literally my favorite color……… I’m looking to see if there’s anything slightly bigger to still use daily but isn’t absolutely gigantic.

Popular Cedar bookstore The Folded Leaf is moving to Commongrounds in Traverse City, a new gluten and dairy-free dessert café and lounge is opening on West Front Street, and more businesses are on the move in *The Ticker’s* latest look at restaurant and retail news.

**New Chapters for Bookstores**  
After [a tumultuous year in Cedar](https://www.leelanauticker.com/news/immediate-building-limitations-at-cedar-station-spell-uncertainty-for-the-folded-leaf-other-businesses/) that included building constraints jeopardizing the bookstore’s future, **The Folded Leaf** has found a new home: the Commongrounds Cooperative building on Eighth Street in Traverse City.

Owner Rachel Zemanek will start leasing 980 square feet in the front of the building February 1. The space, which has large windows facing the street, is smaller than the 1,100 square feet Zemanek has in Cedar but still large enough to feature the same inventory of new and used books, local art, merchandise, and goods from Great Lakes Tea and Spice and Higher Grounds. Zemanek is targeting a soft launch in March, followed by a grand opening celebration April 26 – the one-year anniversary of The Folded Leaf and the weekend of Independent Bookstore Day.

The Folded Leaf, which remains open in Cedar for now Wednesday-Saturday 11am-6pm, will continue to host book club meetings, fundraisers, and some “new and exciting” live events in Traverse City, Zemanek says. She plans to keep the bookstore’s live music series going in Leelanau County by partnering with local businesses to host “The Folded Leaf Presents” concerts. Leelanau remains an important part of The Folded Leaf’s future, according to Zemanek.

“I think it’s important to grow where we planted the business,” she says. Zemanek is in talks to open a future Cedar location in the historic bank building being redeveloped by Corey Flaska, she says. “My goal is to have a permanent location in Traverse City, so that would be a second location,” Zemanek says.

Also on the bookstore front, four booksellers who formerly worked for Brilliant Books have launched a new venture called [**Artemis Books & Goods**](https://www.artemisbooksandgoods.com/). Rachel Sang, Sam Duby, Carissa Yonan, and Caitlin Marsh are planning a series of upcoming author pop-ups, book fairs, online shopping in partnership with [Bookshop.org](http://Bookshop.org), reading recommendations, and other events as they search for a permanent physical location in the Traverse City area.

**Other Downtown Updates**  
A new dessert café and lounge with a focus on clean ingredients is coming to 436 West Front Street.

Mary Westbrook is taking over the ground floor of the Kayak Bike & Brew building for a targeted late February soft launch of **Clean Crumbles**. The business will feature 100 percent gluten-free and dairy-free offerings for both food and beverages, with the menu featuring house-made cinnamon rolls, mini pancakes, banana bread, protein bars, desserts, coffee/tea bars, and more. The lounge area will be outfitted with board games, books, magazines, and seating to “socialize, gather, and relax,” Westbrook says.

Westbrook, who started baking at a young age, has spent the last decade perfecting her recipes after developing severe food intolerances. She began selling her baked goods as a side passion project. Westbrook thought it’d still be years away before she opened her own café, but [when the Front Street space became available](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/restaurant-retail-businesses-on-the-move-downtown-beyond/), “it just all lined up immediately,” she says. Along with an emphasis on minimal clean ingredients, Westbrook says Clean Crumbles will stand out among local bakeries for its hours. “I could just never get to these little places when I worked a 9-5,” she says. She’s planning off-season hours of seven days a week 7am-6pm, with late-night hours and a storefront walk-up window offered in the summer.

Also downtown, Becki Barnwell and Susie Wipperman are launching new brand **The NeedlePoints North (NPN)** as [both an e-retailer](http://theneedlepointsnorth.com/) and pop-up shop on the second floor of 109 East Front Street (unit 215-A). The business will feature hand-selected canvases from up-and-coming designers plus an exclusive NPN canvas collection designed by Barnwell, needlepoint essentials, and local classes. While the owners are on a “mad search for a permanent home,” the Front Street space will serve as a “temporary clubhouse” in the interim, they say. A grand opening/open house is planned for February 12 noon-4pm, followed by weekly pop-in hours of Thursday-Saturday noon-4pm.

Further down Front Street, retail store **Eelo** has closed for a “quick redo” and will reopen on February 4, says owner Jen Vander Roest. “We are prepping to expand our brand and studio supplies as well as bring back our raw materials and fabric soon.”

**More local updates…**  
**Peninsula Market** is adding a ""pretty sizeable hardware department"" to its store on Center Road on Old Mission Peninsula. The business posted Thursday that it’s renovating its backroom space for the addition, which should open in late March or early April. “We have knocked down some walls, done some painting, and are currently building the shelving for this product,” the store posted. “We spent some time last week at a large hardware trade show purchasing product for delivery in March. We are excited to be able to offer this product and to save everyone on the peninsula some driving into town for basic DIY repair products.”

Several changes are coming to the area’s two shopping malls. After [more than a year of review](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/garfield-township-planning-commission-talks-cherryland-center-nightclub-senior-child-care-proposals/), Garfield Township planning commissioners recently approved an application for a proposed nightclub, sports bar, and restaurant center called **High Tops** to open [in the former Younkers space](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/garfield-township-updates-ymca-expansion-high-tops-oleson-property/) at the Cherryland Center. The approval had several conditions attached, including a requirement that all customers park on the south side of the building to avoid noise impacts to residential neighbors. The township had extensive discussion about noise and required a sound study prior to approval; the conditions require that the modeled sound levels be verified before the club receives its certificate of occupancy.

The **Grand Traverse Mall** – which was recently purchased by Namdar Realty Group, a sprawling development group that owns mall properties across the U.S. – is also undergoing several changes. **Ollie’s Bargain Outlet**, [which is taking over the former T.J. Maxx space](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/garfield-township-approves-ollies-cell-tower-public-hearing-set-for-gauthier-project/), is targeting a mid-March opening, a company representative confirmed to *The Ticker*. Ollie’s, which describes itself as “America’s largest retailer of closeout merchandise and excess inventory,” has hundreds of stores selling overstock goods at bargain prices.

**Francesca’s**, a long-time mall staple at locations across the country including the Grand Traverse Mall, is liquidating its inventory and [closing all boutiques](https://wwd.com/business-news/retail/francescas-inventory-shut-down-operations-womens-fashion-1238455030/) nationwide. Meanwhile, the future of **JCPenney** stores remains an open question as a deal for Onyx Partners to purchase the brand [has hit rough waters](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2025/12/29/deal-to-sell-117-jcpenney-stores-falters-even-as-buyer-onyx-stays-committed/%20), with both entities still working through whether the transaction can be finalized.

Finally, several changes are underway at local furniture and carpet stores. Longtime employees Michael and Kristi Watkins have purchased **Floor Covering Brokers Carpet One** and **Carpet Galleria** from Denny and Jo Lauterbach, who are retiring. The two stores together comprise the largest floor covering business in northern Michigan. Along with the same staff, “our customers can expect the same great service, quality products, and professional installation they’ve always received, with the added energy and innovation we’re excited to bring into the next chapter,” says Michael Watkins.

**Golden-Fowler Home Furnishings** is also under new ownership, with Amanda Eshleman purchasing the Garfield Avenue business. “I worked very hard behind the scenes and in front of our valued clients to gain the knowledge and confidence I need to carry on our legacy,” said Eshleman, who previously worked for the company for almost a decade, including as general manager. Finally, **Value City Furniture** is closing all of its stores – including its Traverse City location on Oak Hollow Drive – after parent company American Signature Inc. filed for bankruptcy.",12,1769776245.0,traversecity,1,0.88,False

1qr44u0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1qr44u0/the_milleniaold_question_how_can_oppositesex/,The millenia-old question: How can opposite-sex friendships stay only platonic?,"Interesting subject, I'm curious about how men here feel about this and women you're welcome to comment too! Everybody is invited to discuss. 

I see people talk about this all the time, they ask ""can men and women be friends?"", among other similar questions... so, can they? 
That's a devisive subject people like to call  ""controversy"" nowadays, some hate this question surprisingly.
""It's so obvious, of course you can be friends! Just stop thinking with your dick!""..

Men and women can be friends of course, because that's the wrong question to ask.

Can heterossexual, opposite-sex **close** friendships survive without someone catching feelings for the other? Maybe, but I don't recommend it because it's extremely unlikely.

See, I am a man with life experience and do have female friends, they're more like acquaintances, low-mantenance friendships where we only stay surface level.
They're wives of my mates, I can hang out with them in group settings without an issue, sure, or long-term female friends I call once a month to know how they're doing.
Work/gym/business oriented meetings, those are acquaintances not close friendships.

I do not intend of having a **close** female friend unless I'm looking to date her. Why? Because that's the natural progression of a healthy relationship, so why wouldn't I like her that way at some point?
Strangers -> acquaintances -> friends -> good friends -> best friends -> lovers.

Biologically speaking, the numbers don't lie, men have more testosterone and our ""monkey-brain"" is telling us to bring forth the human race all the time, testosterone makes us hornier, no wonder a testosterone shot help women a lot with their low libido!

Women are okay with emotional connection without sex, men aren't. So when connection is there without the sex we're expecting the full package. It's that simple!

I have a close connection with my sister, she's my only close female friend other than my wife. And out of respect to my wife, I'm not meeting females 1one1, not because i can't keep my dick in my pants but to bring transparency into the relationship.

Last thing I want is to bring stress into my life by having ""a female friend my wife shouldn't worry about"".
And I demand respect from other dudes when I'm in a committed relationship, so I also expect the same from her.

Of course she will worry, because she knows how women are, just like men understand men better.
A lot of women enjoy the attention from ""guy friends"", creating an emotional bond (women love attention more than sex in average) this makes her content, she friendzones the guy knowing he's got blueballs and would sleep with her at any given opportunity. That's not a friendship, that's courship from him and ungenuity from her, both are lying to themselves.
It can also happen that women are also oblivious/naive about this but this fits mostly young women/teenager/post teenager, a lot of them know specially the older they are. 

Most of the time it's platonic from the woman side but I wonder how much of that isn't borderline emotional cheating. Think with me: a comitted woman has a best guy friend whom she has deep talks with. She tells him about her deepest fears, hopes and dreams and sometimes even talks about her man/her relationship with this guy. They're basically boyfriend and girlfriend without calling it so.
But she enjoys it because she attained her ultimate goal: attention/emotional bonding.

The guy has it worse because he doesn't attain his ultimate goal: sex.
But he's patient and keeps on going in hopes he can sleep with her in the future, even when he doesn't wanna admit it. He's so nice! Shower her with compliments, bring gifts, is readily available to fix her car or help her move. The nice guy in waiting.

I learned long ago: I can't be **good** friends with women I find attractive/hot.
Can I be friends? Yes sure, I can leave it at a very low-effort friendship.
If I keep on seeing her 1on1, night drink at a bar, cinema, find common ground, etc.. sex always gets in the way at some point because monkey brain starts acting up ""this fine woman can help bring your genes forward"".
I got an emotional attachment with her? And she's also hot? of course I want more, our brain is just wired that way.

I know this will come eventually, not because I chose to in the beginning, but because it naturally happens eventually. 

Many people demonize men for this. Listen, not everything is about primal instincts I know, we are intellectual beings. But why would I be close friends with a hot female if I keep thinking about sex with her? I have better stuff to do than entertaining this ""friendship"". I have much more fun and things in common with guys anyway, no offense but with guys I can be definitely 100% platonic, we play videogames together, play basketball, go boxing, watch football. We can say ""fuck you"" to each other and laugh so hard our belly hurts.

That is for me and true platonic friendship.
I can be good friends with women if they're family, or they're old like and treat me like she's my grandma, or I have NO attraction whatsoever. But unfortunately many times in that situation the girl tries to have it with me.

My female friends are surface level friendships, whom I see in group dynamics or occasionally have a coffee during the day, which I always insist in inviting my woman to, and I make sure to ask them how their husband is doing. I make sure in being bros with my female friends' boyfriends to make sure they know I'm not a threat, that's also important.

My female friends need to be friends with the couple, either that or nothing at all.
And I expect the same from her male friends.

Opposite-sex friendships of this kind is something new in human history, it was never like that before. My dad would never hang out alone with a female, neither my mom would do that with a man.
Casual hookups made this possible, and it made everything all that more confusing.

Is the title of this post possible? Yes, but boundaries and knowledge of opposite-sex friendships' psychology are both necessary for healthy, genuine relationships.
This results in a better life with your partner, a better marriage.
