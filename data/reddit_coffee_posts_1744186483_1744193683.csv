I have been blessed as ambassador elite to stay at almost all the marriott infinity stone properties over the years. None of them could even last one round in the ring with JW Masai Mara Lodge. The hotel itself is so intimate and immaculate. The attention to detail is insane. What makes this hotel is the staff, there is no staff at any hotel in the world better than this one. That includes, Aman, four seasons and all other luxury properties, this is as good as it gets. Eric our game driver was a total legend, he knew every questions we asked him over the 7 days we were there. He knew all the locals and park rangers, he single handily made the trip. I consider him the best marriott employee in the world. Nothing was out of his reach, any and all requests were taken care of instantly. Benjamin our waiter, could work at Le Jules Verne in the Eiffel Tower and any other Michelin restaurant in the world. It is truly is remarkable how good of service he gave us for all 3 meals a day. Victor the mixologist, and Joseph the cigar master were also incredibly talented, and could easily manage any bar on the world‚Äôs top 100 list. Josiah could manage any coffee shop in the world. Wilson, Brian, Tanuj, and Peter the concierges could easily be any CEO‚Äôs personal assistants, any request was instantly taken care of. It‚Äôs hard to even put into words how amazing this property is. It makes St Regis Maldives service look like a Courtyard in Alabama USA. The spa was as nice as it could have possibly been for being in the middle of literally nowhere. I don‚Äôt leave reviews of properties, but the employees worked so hard and were so talented I felt I needed to let the world know. Kennedy the canon camera master taught me more in one week than an entire semester of film class. Mary head of housekeeping would even leave a hot water bottle in your bed at night, and would do turn down service multiple times a day if it was needed. The property itself is incredible, and I recommend to anyone going to do the Maasai Village visit, it was a much needed shift of perspective. We sometimes forget that if you are healthy, and have a safe place to sleep at night, that we are better off than so many people. The JW garden and sustainability center is also a must tour. I wanted to leave this to personally thank Benjamin, Peter, Wilson, Victor, Mary, Kennedy, Josiah, Brian, Tanuj and Joseph but especially the living legend Eric. They are all there form the time you wake up to the time you go to sleep. If I were to open a hotel, I would make my Managment stay here to see how incredible a stay can be. If you have any questions please ask away. And most importantly if you go make sure you get Eric as your game driver and Benjamin as your waiter. Bless!",1,1744193589.0,marriott,0,1.0,False
1jv298c,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jv298c/i_m27_feel_emotionally_distant_from_my_gf_f25_how/,I (M27) feel emotionally distant from my GF (F25). How can I improve communication and connection?,"About a year and a half ago, I was in a serious relationship that ended just one day before our wedding. I stayed single for about a year, and then six months ago, I started dating my current girlfriend. This is my first relationship with someone from a different country.

I‚Äôm from the Middle East, not religious, and open-minded. My girlfriend is from Europe. Her last serious relationship ended three years ago, and since then she had short-term casual relationships. She told me those ended because she wanted something serious, but her partners didn‚Äôt.

In my previous relationships, especially in my country, it was normal to spend a lot of time together at the beginning ‚Äì talking, bonding, sharing. Then, as the relationship matured, we‚Äôd give each other more personal space. But in this relationship, it feels like we started with space from the very beginning.

She has many hobbies ‚Äì horseback riding (she owns a horse and needs to care for it daily), motorbiking, and more. I understand and respect her passion, especially for the horse, but this leaves us with very little quality time together. Often, when she‚Äôs finally free, she‚Äôs too tired to talk or do anything together.

Also, most of our conversations during that time are either very short or sexual. She doesn‚Äôt open up emotionally or talk about her past or feelings. Instead, she often tries to turn the conversation into something sexual. For example:

* After arguments, she doesn‚Äôt want to talk but instead tries to touch me or say sexual things to avoid the discussion.
* She keeps sending sexual texts or photos, even though we have sex only once or twice a week, and I have a much higher sex drive.
* She rarely expresses emotional affection through words ‚Äì it's mostly through teasing or flirting, and when I respond sexually, she changes her mind.

All of this makes me feel like I‚Äôm in a ‚Äúcasual situationship‚Äù rather than a serious relationship ‚Äì even though she says she wants something long-term.

Another issue that bothers me is how she jokes about attraction. For example:

* She says she‚Äôs always liked tall, blonde, blue-eyed European guys (I have black hair and eyes, and I‚Äôm the same height as her).
* When a client asked her out for coffee, she said she declined because he was ‚Äútoo old and ugly.‚Äù I asked if that was the only reason, and she just laughed and said ‚Äúyes.‚Äù

Maybe it‚Äôs cultural, but these comments confuse me. I do see signs she cares ‚Äì like showing me to her friends and family, taking pictures of us, remembering things I like. But still, I‚Äôm unsure if she‚Äôs happy in this relationship.

Lastly, it often feels like spending time with me is just another task on her to-do list. After work and horse care, she comes to me just to eat and sleep. On weekends, she still spends most of her time with her horse and returns too tired to talk or do anything with me.

So, my questions:

1. Is this emotional distance and low quality time normal in European relationships?
2. Is it possible she sees me more as a sexual partner than a real emotional one, even if she says she wants something serious?
3. Am I being too sensitive or is there something missing in this relationship?

Any thoughts or experiences would help. Thank you.",1,1744193544.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

She seems nice and I was talking to her a few times. I live about an hour away from work but she is a local, but anyways, I met her on a night out in the nightclub, she saw me first and came over ( I was following my friends) and we got talking and I wanted to ask her if she wanted a drink but then she mentioned that some guy kept annoying her earlier on wanting to buy her a drink even when she said no. She then said that she told him that she's married and he was still trying, and I wasn't fully sure I heard her right so I asked what was that last part,  she said that she told him that she was married, but then she told me that she wasn't only its usually a good excuse to avoid a lad chatting her up. We chatted for a few more minutes and I wanted to ask her if she wanted a drink but I decided I should leave it just incase it annoyed her after her story. I told her I better catch up with the lads and for her to enjoy the rest of her night. Tbh it was only that night that I learnt her name because it was usually small talk or different things like that in the canteen when I'd usually see her. I regretted not asking the morning after. She mentioned she's going to be getting a new job in July, and with my shift I wont see her for another 2 weeks. I was wondering if I should just ask her the next time I see her if she'd fancy a coffee or food sometime, no pressure. Obviously I wouldn't ask infront of people but do ye think that'd be ok? Tbh I don't know if she's just nice, but I'd still like to ask her and see.

Update: 
So I got chatting to her, we were talking and I asked if she'd fancy a coffee and she said she'd be up for it, I said there's no pressure, she said like maybe for a friendly coffee. I assume that's a no so I said we can talk and see. I assume its a polite no, do ye think I'm right? ",1,1744193512.0,AskIreland,0,1.0,False

I just wanted to share my journey in case it helps someone else.

I'm a postmenopausal woman, 5‚Äô4‚Äù, who gained weight after menopause and could never lose it. I hate regular exercise and never managed to stick to diets. I had almost accepted that my higher weight was my ‚Äúnew normal,‚Äù even though my BMI said I was overweight.

In January, I was rushed into hospital with horrendous pain and vomiting. I was diagnosed with a 1cm gallstone stuck in my gallbladder, causing an infection. Normally, they would have removed it straight away, but due to NHS pressures, I was sent home to wait. I was terrified, especially because my grandfather had passed away from the same thing.

To avoid another emergency hospital visit, the consultant advised a very low-fat diet. Out of fear, I stuck to it ‚Äî and that's where everything changed.

At first, it was hard figuring out what I could eat, but soon I built a big list of foods I enjoyed. I didn‚Äôt cut sugar, didn‚Äôt count calories, and didn‚Äôt exercise ‚Äî I simply swapped anything high in fat for low- or zero-fat alternatives.

Soon I realised my clothes felt looser and people started commenting on my weight loss. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt feel like I was on a diet at all ‚Äî and I lost 1 stone 5lbs in just 10 weeks!

Last Thursday, I had my gallbladder removed. The doctors said I could now return to a normal diet, but I feel so much better than I have in years that I‚Äôve decided to stick with low-fat eating, while now having the benefit of being able to enjoy treats when dining out.

Here are some of the simple swaps and meals I enjoyed:

* Milk: Swapped to long-life skimmed milk (tastes better than fresh skimmed!).
* Coleslaw: Aldi‚Äôs rainbow coleslaw (made with yogurt instead of mayo ‚Äî surprisingly delicious).
* Meals/Breakfast: Jacket potatoes with beans or tuna & sweetcorn (mixed with low-fat mayo) or rainbow coleslaw; homemade fishcakes (potatoes, onion + tinned fish in brine); lentil and veggie stews; soups; egg, fish, low-fat meat-based meals; rice dishes made with tinned tomatoes, onions, peppers and spices; homemade vegetable bakes; bananas/fruit on low-fat cereals with skimmed milk; and as much veg, salad and fruit as I wanted.
* Snacks: Rich tea thins, fruit, crumpets, and low-fat yogurts. I made a delicious fat-free cake using eggs, which I kept in my fridge to snack on with a coffee or tea (happy to share the recipe if anyone wants it!).

Too many swaps to list them all but you get the idea! I ate similar amounts to before ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt strict, hungry, or counting anything. I just stayed mindful not to let ""lots of 0%-low-fat"" foods add up to being accidentally high-fat. Even my old comfy pyjamas now fall down when I put them on! üòÑ

For anyone like me who struggles with dieting, hates exercise and feels stuck with their weight ‚Äî I wanted to share this.  
For me, just focusing on low-fat swaps (without obsessing over calories) made a bigger difference than I ever thought possible. I know there are lots of great ways to lose weight with a strict diet and exercise plan, but that was hard (or impossible) for someone like me.

So I thought I would share in then hope this helps someone out there!¬†",1,1744193415.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

The strangeness of emotionless mornings,"It‚Äôs not fear, sadness, or anger. It‚Äôs just... emptiness. A sense that nothing matters. You wake up, but it feels like you‚Äôre still asleep inside.

This is a quiet face of anxiety. And also of depression. When everything feels dull, flavorless, pointless.

But even emptiness can be gently filled. A warm shower, a song that stirs something, a slow-brewed coffee.

Don‚Äôt blame yourself for feeling this way. You‚Äôre going through something hard, and just being here, reading this, is a sign of strength.

1jv22wt,https://i.redd.it/0nclexit8ste1.png,The Test Call,"On a rainy weekday afternoon, a teenage boy stepped into a bustling co-working caf√© in Mumbai. The kind that rents out desks and offers free Wi-Fi for a few hours if you buy a cup of coffee. He ordered a chai and borrowed the caf√©‚Äôs public phone, tucked in a quiet corner. Curious eyes from nearby tables turned toward him as he dialed a number.

‚ÄúHello, ma‚Äôam. Good afternoon,‚Äù he said politely when a woman picked up on the other end. ‚ÄúI was wondering if you're looking for someone to manage your Airbnb flat‚Äîcleaning, groceries, quick fixes?‚Äù

There was a pause before the woman replied, ‚ÄúThanks, but I already have someone handling that.‚Äù

The boy didn‚Äôt give up. ‚ÄúI can do it at a lower rate, and I‚Äôm available on call‚Äîday or night.‚Äù

The woman stayed firm. ‚ÄúI appreciate the offer, but I‚Äôm happy with the person I have. They‚Äôre very reliable.‚Äù

The boy added quickly, ‚ÄúI can also handle guest check-ins and make sure the fridge is stocked before every arrival.‚Äù

Still, the woman said no, thanked him politely, and ended the call.

The caf√©‚Äôs owner, a man in his thirties who‚Äôd been wiping tables nearby, walked over with a smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sharp, kid. Hustling hard. I like that. I could use someone like you around here. Interested in a job?‚Äù

The boy smiled. ‚ÄúThanks, sir. But I‚Äôm already working.‚Äù

The man looked confused. ‚ÄúThen why were you asking for work just now?‚Äù

The boy tucked the phone back in place and said, ‚ÄúThat was my current employer. I just wanted to know if she‚Äôs truly happy with my work. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

The owner blinked, then slowly nodded, a smirk of admiration curling on his lips ‚ÄúSmart move.‚Äù

1jv20yr,https://i.redd.it/q1ev4rdpzrte1.png,What would your optimal end of Eminems career look like?,"I‚Äôve been a huge Eminem fan for years. I have every album on CD, some on vinyl ‚Äì even the newer ones. I own hoodies, books, and all kinds of merch. I‚Äôm saying this so no one thinks I‚Äôm just a hater or something.

But looking back I do kinda start to think it‚Äôs time for him to hang up the mic. One more album. A true goodbye where he goes all out. Something for the fans.

Features fans have been hoping for over the years ‚Äì Dre, 50, Rihanna, and others ‚Äì would make it feel like a proper sendoff. The kind of energy, emotion, and humor that defined his best work. No ‚Äúawfully hot coffee pots,‚Äù no ‚Äúgenzmebra,‚Äù no rage-bait, no rapping faster and faster just because he can.

To be clear ‚Äì I **don‚Äôt** hate his post-MMLP2 era. In fact, I think after *Revival* and *Kamikaze*, he started moving in the right direction again. Even those albums have tracks I really enjoy. But for me, they don‚Äôt come close to his earlier work.

He has nothing left to prove ‚Äì that much is true. And if he wants to keep making music, not trying to stop him. But I‚Äôm just saying what I think would be the **best** ending:  
One final solo studio album.  
Packed with bangers.  
Legendary features.  
Funny lyrincs.

Everything that made him the greatest in the first place.  
A definitive end. Going out on top, on his own terms. One last peak.

Now, some might say that *The Death of Slim Shady* was exactly that ‚Äî fan service, callbacks, the whole package. And I did enjoy it. *Houdini* was great, and *Guilty Conscience II* was a cool idea (even if it lacked a Dre feature).

But I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ it still felt a bit forced to me. Like something was missing.

And yeah, I get that my expectations are kind of insane ‚Äî but the thing is, Eminem used to **meet** those expectations. Sometimes he‚Äôd even surpass them.

I guess I‚Äôm still holding out hope that he can surpass them one more time.

1jv20p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_mysteriouslearner/comments/1jv20p7/paid_readings_guidelines/,Paid readings guidelines.,"Hi!  
This post is for people looking for a deeper, more personal reading that takes time, care, and energy. You probably had a free reading with me. That's why you're here again, and I'm very grateful for it.

I don‚Äôt predict the future. I don‚Äôt read minds. I don‚Äôt twist messages to make them nicer. What you can expect is an honest, grounded reading that helps you see your own thoughts, patterns, and feelings more clearly. I use tarot to reflect what‚Äôs going on inside you. The way I read is raw. Each card is a mirror. I write with honesty and care, like I‚Äôm talking to you face to face, in front of a black coffee. No sugar for me, neither for you.

**Please read this before messaging me:**

I only use PayPal. I live in Italy, so keep the time zone in mind. 

I won‚Äôt read about health and pregnancy.

All readings are written. No voice notes or recordings. I live with other people around and there's always something happening. I need to sit down, gain clarity and write what the cards are telling me.

I usually deliver within 24 hours, depending on my availability.

Third parties readings are tricky. You can ask about your ex, your friend, someone who's tied to you. But I will not be able to tell you if Jason, the loverboy you never spoke to, will walk to you during lunch and ask you out.   

I won‚Äôt read the same situation over and over again. Tarot isn‚Äôt meant for obsession. If my reading suggests X outcome, trying again won't change it. It would just make you miserable.

If you‚Äôre in a rough emotional place or you‚Äôre clinging to one outcome, take a pause before booking.

When we‚Äôre too overwhelmed, it‚Äôs harder to take in the message or sit with the truth the cards reflect.

The reading may feel distorted or unsatisfying if you're just looking for one specific answer.

I‚Äôll be kind, but I won‚Äôt give false hope. These readings can bring truth, not guarantees.

Only reach out if you're ready to hear what the cards reflect.

When reaching out, please offer a bit of background for your specific situation. Otherwise, the reading would be as vague as the info provided.  


**Yes or no reading: 2‚Ç¨**  
This is a one-card pull. You‚Äôll get a clear yes or no, a full explanation of what the card shows in your specific context and my honest advice. It‚Äôs short but focused, useful when you need direction or want to reflect on a decision.

**3 Card Pull: 3‚Ç¨**  
This is a simple reading when you want to check in with yourself. I pull three cards and explain what they reflect about your current energy, mindset, or emotional state. It‚Äôs good for gaining a bit of clarity when things feel unclear or when you just want a little support without going too deep.

**Harsh Truth Spread: 5‚Ç¨**  
This is a 3-card reading for when you‚Äôre ready to hear what you‚Äôve been avoiding. It‚Äôs honest, direct, and not sugarcoated. You‚Äôll see what truth you‚Äôre not facing, how it‚Äôs holding you back, and what you need to accept to move forward. This is for people who want immediate clarity more than comfort.



**RELATIONSHIP READINGS**

7‚Ç¨ to 10‚Ç¨, based on how many cards are used and the depth of your situation.

  
**No Contact Reflection**   
This reading is for when someone has disappeared or blocked you, and you're stuck in silence. It helps you explore what the silence is really saying, what you're still hoping for, and what part of you is stuck waiting. This isn‚Äôt about what they‚Äôre feeling or doing. It‚Äôs about the story the silence is triggering in you, and what it‚Äôs asking you to face. 

**Reconciliation reading**  
This reading is not about them. Is about you. What needs to change in order to reconcile. It looks at what you're still carrying, what you're projecting, and what emotions haven‚Äôt found closure. It helps you understand where your pain or hope is coming from, and what part of you might still be waiting or avoiding acceptance.

**Truth in love reading**  
This is for when things feel confusing or unclear between you and someone else. It helps you see where your feelings are coming from, where theirs may be misunderstood, and what stories you might be telling yourself. It‚Äôs not about who's right.¬†

**Stay or leave reading**   
This reading is for when you feel torn.  
You‚Äôre holding on but also thinking about letting go. It helps you understand what your heart is really asking for, what fears are keeping you stuck, and what still feels unresolved. Together, we look at what ending or staying would mean for your peace.

  
**GUIDANCE READINGS**

**Guidance spread: 12‚Ç¨**  
This is a full reading made to offer emotional support and clarity. I use 7 to 10 cards depending on your situation. It helps you understand what you're holding inside, what's quietly changing, and where you're being called to grow or let go. Good for when you‚Äôre not in crisis, but still need guidance, grounding, or a small push forward.

**INTENSIVE READINGS**

Please remember, none of my spreads can replace therapy, medical care, or the healing work you do on your own. Tarot can offer insight, reflection, and support, but it‚Äôs not a fix or a substitute for real-life help. I care deeply about what I do, and I want you to use it with wisdom and awareness.

  
**Career Path Spread: 15‚Ç¨**

This reading is for when you feel stuck, lost, or uncertain about your direction in work or purpose. It looks at what motivates you, where you feel blocked, what path might feel more aligned, and what fears or beliefs may be holding you back. This isn‚Äôt about predicting a job offer, but helping you reconnect with what matters to you and seeing what direction feels most real and right for you now.

**Custom spread: 20‚Ç¨**  
Your story matters, even if it doesn‚Äôt fit a fixed spread.  
If you're struggling with something specific, or a mix of emotions that‚Äôs hard to explain, I‚Äôll design a spread just for you.  
You tell me what‚Äôs going on, and I‚Äôll shape the reading around it.  
It‚Äôs personal, flexible, and made to meet you exactly where you are.  
These spreads still follow the same deep, honest tone, with card placements that help reflect what you‚Äôre holding, what‚Äôs shifting, and what might help you take the next step  
.

**Wound healing spread: 25‚Ç¨**  
This is my most in-depth reading. It's a 10-12 cards pull. It looks at the wounds you carry but often keep hidden. This spread doesn‚Äôt offer a quick fix. It holds space for your pain and growth. I take extra care with this one because it‚Äôs meant to feel like a slow breath after holding everything in too long. If you‚Äôve been through something heavy and don‚Äôt know how to move forward, this is a valid stepping stone.

I had an exam in person, blood tests and was then referred to have the camera.  All came back clear from any nasty stuff.  They said you have haemorrhoids and that was that, fast forward a few months at the GP for something unrelated and I did bring up still feel bloated, sick at times and needed to go to the toilet alot at times, where the GP said how are you handling the IBS?  It was a bit of a shock as that was the first I was told about it so I suspect it was not mentioned.

Fast forward to now, I think my main big no no's are Garlic and Onion they really trigger it, one cup of coffee is fine but no more.  I'm still trying to work out what sets it off sometimes I think I found something new, but next time I eat it and I'm fine.  Using a FODMAP and half the bad stuff is completely ok and no flare ups.

I have a few questions and hope others can help:

1. Is it normal to think a certain food item triggers it but then if you do eat it you're fine like sometimes your gut can just handle it?
2. Stools are all over the place and sometimes you need to feel like your bowels are not empty?
3. Anxious and paranoid its not IBS but something more sinister going on, like in the back of my mind I worry about it.

Now they are just bland and watery and any notes are almost lost, if I tighten the ratio the brews get a bit more body but taste wise there's not really any gain (ofc I'm using the same beans as before)

I've been trying to add those ~35ppm with four additional drops each of Ca and Mg, taste got somewhat back but it's just a very muddy cup like you would get from a low clarity grinder (I have a Pietro ProBrew)

I admit I have no idea what each Lotus solution actually does so I'm playing blind, does any of you have any suggestion on how to bring back clarity and juiciness to my brews? I'm wasting both coffee and liters of water by experimenting without any actual idea of what I'm doing :(",1,1744192276.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I figured I'll manage as there was a rubber vodka cork on scene(yeah that also hurt) but the cork has started to dissolve a bit and notably change the flavour to, well, cork

I seen somewhere a man using a coffee filter to strain a fancy wine in this situation once, would that be a suitable approach and if I do strain it into another bottle, will the cork taste bugger off(or is my experience of the 19y/o essentially ruined)

I‚Äôve been grinding in two different SDR roles for 19 months now. 

I‚Äôm done. Not just tired. 

Not the ‚Äúugh, Mondays suck‚Äù kind of tired. I‚Äôm burnt out. Like the toast you forgot about while staring into your coffee. 

I thought this was supposed to be a launchpad, a stepping stone to something bigger. 

Turns out, it‚Äôs just a treadmill in business casual: you‚Äôre running hard, sweating buckets, but the finish line keeps moving. 

And who‚Äôs actually winning? Not me. 

Someone else is getting fit while my knees give out.

The ‚Äúdream‚Äù of climbing the ladder? It‚Äôs more cold calls, more forced smiles, more meetings that could‚Äôve been blessed silence. More pretending to care about prospects who‚Äôd block me if they even sniffed a pitch coming their way.

The promotion everyone dreams about? They can keep it. 

I don‚Äôt even want it anymore. What‚Äôs the point? 

I want real. Real work. Real conversations. Real purpose.

Right now, I wake up and wonder if it‚Äôs Monday or Tuesday, and it doesn‚Äôt matter.

And the worst part isn‚Äôt what I do. It‚Äôs who I‚Äôm becoming doing it.

I‚Äôm tired of seeing AEs make double my salary when I have better discovery and sales skills than them.

I‚Äôm frustrated with the lack of personal touch at scale, making genuine connections feel impossible.

I‚Äôm tired of being handed garbage leads and told to ‚Äúmake magic happen.‚Äù 

Tired of rejection that feels personal no matter how much they tell you not to take it that way.

Tired of quotas that feel like a setup for failure and tools that barely work when you need them most.

Tired of:

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs align on priorities.‚Äù
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs circle back.‚Äù
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs touch base.‚Äù

Touch what? A spreadsheet? My last nerve?

I didn‚Äôt sign up for this to become a calendar puppet or an CRM monkey. 

I wanted freedom, meaning, something real. 

Instead, I‚Äôm stuck in a loop of activity mistaken for progress and noise mistaken for impact.

I‚Äôm not writing this for applause. Or a ‚Äúhang in there, champ.‚Äù

I‚Äôm writing this because I know I‚Äôm not the only one.

Not sure what‚Äôs next for me yet. But I know it‚Äôs not this. 

If you‚Äôve found a way out, something that makes you feel alive again without selling your soul for a 15-minute meeting, tell me.

Because I‚Äôm not afraid of hard work. 

I‚Äôm afraid of waking up five years from now and not recognizing myself anymore.

# Cuisinart Grind & Brew (2025): Best Model & Alternatives Compared - Is It Worth It?

For coffee aficionados, the aroma of freshly ground beans is the cornerstone of a perfect morning. The Cuisinart grind & Brew line of coffee makers promises precisely that: the freshest possible cup, brewed to your specifications, all from a single, convenient appliance. But with various models and ever-evolving technology, how do you choose the best Cuisinart Grind & Brew for your needs? and, perhaps more importantly, is a Cuisinart coffee maker with grinder truly worth the investment? Let's dive into a thorough review, comparing models, weighing pros and cons, and exploring alternatives to help you make an informed decision.

[[Explore Top Rated cuisinart grind & brew on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=cuisinart grind & brew)
## The Allure of Freshly Ground Coffee: Why Grind & Brew?

Before exploring specific models, let's establish the fundamental appeal of a grind and brew coffee maker. Pre-ground coffee loses flavor and aroma quickly,like a symphony silenced before it begins. Grinding your beans right before brewing unlocks the full potential of your chosen coffee, releasing volatile oils and complex flavors that are simply unavailable with pre-ground alternatives. A programmable grind and brew coffee maker elevates this experience by automating the entire process. Set it up the night before, and wake up to the irresistible scent of freshly brewed coffee, ready to kickstart your day. the convenience of an all-in-one system is also appealing, decluttering your countertop and streamlining your coffee routine.

## Cuisinart Grind & Brew: A Deep Dive into the Lineup

Cuisinart has established itself as a prominent player in the grind and brew coffee maker market. Their offerings range from compact models perfect for single households to larger, more sophisticated machines designed for entertaining. Let's examine some popular models and their key features:

**1. Cuisinart Grind and Brew Automatic Coffee Maker (DGB-900BC):** Frequently enough considered the flagship model, the DGB-900BC boasts a fully automatic operation, a 12-cup capacity, and a burr grinder. Burr grinders are generally preferred over blade grinders as they produce a more consistent grind, leading to a more even extraction and superior flavor. This model features a direct flow grind assembly that efficiently moves coffee through the grinder ensuring minimal mess. It also has adjustable grind settings, allowing you to customize the fineness of the grind to your preference. For users looking for convenience, this option is easily programmable, features a brew pause function, and an automatic shutoff.

**2. Cuisinart DGB-800:** The DGB-800 is an earlier iteration of the 12-cup model,but still a viable option when looking for a cuisinart grind & brew . It typically comes at a lower price point but still offers the convenience of an integrated grinder and automatic brewing. Features like a charcoal water filter and gold-tone filter are frequently included for enhanced taste. While the core functionality remains similar to the DGB-900BC, some users may find the design and user interface slightly less refined. With the Burr Grind & Brew 12 Cup Coffee maker, you have an innovative DirectFlow grind assembly that seamlessly moves coffee through the grinder and into the brew basket.

**3. Cuisinart Grind and Brew single-Serve Coffee Maker (DGB-2):** For those who prefer a single cup of coffee, this model combines the advantages of a grind and brew system with the convenience of a single-serve machine. It features a built-in conical burr grinder, like the HomeBarista, that automatically grinds whole beans tailored to your flavor. This is an excellent option for individuals living alone or those who want the freshest cup possible without brewing an entire pot.

**4. Other Grind & Brew Models:** Cuisinart frequently updates its product line, so be sure to research the latest models available. Pay close attention to features such as grinder type (burr vs. blade), capacity, programmability, ease of cleaning, and warranty coverage.[[Explore Top Rated cuisinart grind & brew on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=cuisinart grind & brew)
## Features to Consider When Choosing a Cuisinart Grind & Brew

Beyond model numbers, several factors contribute to the overall performance and user experience of a Cuisinart Grind & Brew. Consider the following:

*   **Grinder Type (Burr vs. Blade):** As mentioned earlier, burr grinders are generally superior to blade grinders. Burr grinders crush the beans between two revolving abrasive surfaces, resulting in a consistent grind size. Blade grinders, on the other hand, chop the beans with a spinning blade, leading to an uneven grind with inconsistent particle sizes. An uneven grind can result in over-extraction of some particles and under-extraction of others, leading to a bitter or sour-tasting coffee.
*   **Capacity:** Determine how many cups of coffee you typically brew. Cuisinart Grind & Brew models range from single-serve to 12-cup capacity. Choose a size that aligns with your daily coffee consumption.
*   **programmability:** Programmable features allow you to set the coffee maker to automatically grind and brew at a specific time.This is a valuable time-saving feature for busy mornings. With a programmable grind and brew coffee maker, you‚Äôll always have the option to wake up with coffee ready for you.
*   **Grind Settings:** The ability to adjust the grind size is crucial for tailoring the coffee to your preferences. Finer grinds are suitable for espresso or strong coffee,while coarser grinds are better for French press or cold brew.
*   **Strength Settings:** Some models offer adjustable brew strength settings, allowing you to customize the intensity of the coffee.
*   **ease of Cleaning:** Cleaning a grind and brew coffee maker can be more involved than cleaning a standard drip coffee maker. Look for models with removable parts and dishwasher-safe components. Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining the coffee maker's performance and preventing the buildup of stale coffee grounds, which can affect the taste of your coffee.
*   **Water Filtration:** Many Cuisinart Grind & Brew models include a charcoal water filter.These filters remove chlorine and other impurities from the water, resulting in better-tasting coffee.
*   **Carafe Type:** glass carafes are common and allow you to see the coffee level, but they can be prone to breaking. Thermal carafes are typically made of stainless steel and will keep your coffee hot for longer without altering the taste.*   **Price:** Cuisinart Grind & Brew coffee makers vary in price, with higher-end models commanding a premium. Set a budget and compare features to find the best value for your money.

## Cuisinart Grind and Brew vs Breville: A Head-to-Head Comparison

The Cuisinart Grind & Brew faces stiff competition from other brands, particularly Breville. Breville grind and brew coffee makers are known for their advanced features, precision grinding, and sleek designs. While Breville models often come at a higher price point, they may offer superior performance and durability.

Here's a brief comparison:

*   **Grinding Technology:** While both brands offer burr grinders, Breville often emphasizes the precision and consistency of their grinding technology, resulting in a more even extraction and refined flavor.
*   **Features:** Breville models often include advanced features such as adjustable water temperature, pre-infusion settings, and precise grind size control.
*   **Price:** Cuisinart Grind & Brew coffee makers are generally more affordable than Breville models.
*   **Aesthetics:** Breville is known for its modern and stylish designs, while Cuisinart's aesthetics tend to be more traditional.

If you're looking for a reliable and affordable grind and brew coffee maker, cuisinart is a solid choice.

Context: Okay na okay naman kami ni bf and mutual decision namin not to feel pressured on monthsaries kase LDR kami (PH sya, ako abroad). Oks na yung we greet each other. Pero iba yung sa anniversary, gusto ko sana kahit papaano may something. Kaso lang I dont see any hints na he‚Äôs up to something for the anniversary. I was joking pa nga like ‚Äúpano tayo mag virtual date nyan‚Äù pero sagot nya ‚Äúongae ayyy‚Äù, sabay change topic. i just feel na wala talaga sya plan to surprise me or what bc ask pa nya if ano nalang daw ba bibilhin KO na food kase ganon nalang din bibilhin nya. Clear ko lang po na hindi ako materialistic na gf. I know in my heart na never ako nagdemand sakanya ng kahit anong bagay. I just feel sad this time kase I am expecting something from him but I just couldnt tell him. Dahilan nya din kase minsan na gusto nya ako bilhan ng coffee on random days kaso hindi daw nya alam pano ako bibilhan dahil nasa abroad ako. pag gusto may paraan diba? he can order online and have it delivered to me just like how i order him something from foodpanda on random days din. Baka wala syang pera? I dont think so dahil he would transfer me money para ipag-order sya ng pyesa ng motor nya na di rin biro ang price (US wbesite kaya ako lang pwede mag order). Kaya siguro nalulungkot ako dahil wala lang talaga akong nakikita na effort even on random days so what more sa anniversary namin. Gusto ko lang din ng princess treatment minsan huhu. 

Previous Attempts: I told him na I‚Äôm sad and I want to make an effort for the anniversary (waiting for him to say the same thing). I think nainis sya kesyo di naman daw forever yung LDR and wag daw ako malungkot dahil dapat masaya lang sa anniversary.

Any advice on this? Ako ba yung mali dahil pinapangunahan ko sya? Masyado bang mababaw yung problema ko or I have to address this to him? Worry ko lang na if I do tell him, baka sabihin nya sinusumbatan ko sya. Love na love ko sya but there are days lang na i think i deserve more efforts from him.

Please excuse my wordiness, but I genuinely feel like I am losing my mind. 

I (36F) had a positive experience with braces in my tweens, got them removed in 2003 at age 15. I needed veneers placed on my top two ‚Äúpeg‚Äù lateral incisors (7 and 10), which were placed very shortly after the braced came off, and lasted **with no issues** until October 2024. In the past five years or so I‚Äôd noticed a teeny-tiny bit of wear on #10, from a particularly pointy canine #22, but nothing terrible enough to affect my bite, the veneer, etc. 

But #8 and #9 were both noticeably longer than all my other teeth, to the point that I was teased with ‚ÄúBunny‚Äù or ‚ÄúCarny (OP Name).‚Äù They were also sensitive to temperature, sweetness, etc. Obviously this was a point of self-consciousness for me, so when I was financially able to do so, I went to my dentist for a veneer discussion. This was in October of 2024. 

I had the 3D scans done, approved the wax up, waiting for the lab to make the veneers, had the removal process done and temporaries fitted, and in December 2024 got the permanent veneers fitted. I even had #22 shaved down every so slightly so as not to damage the #10 veneer. I loved them, everything was sunshine and rainbows. 

**It is now April of 2025, and this morning #8 snapped in half/broke off for the second time since they were applied. Permanent veneer #10 has broken off twice prior, as well.**

I was trying to open a snack pack of dried cranberries and pineapple, and I will admit, THIS TIME I wasn‚Äôt thinking and tried to hold the packet between my teeth and open it with my fingers. I know, I know, I shouldn‚Äôt have, but in my defense I had yet to caffeinate or eat, and wasn‚Äôt exactly firing on all cylinders. This time is fully my fault and my mistake. 

But this was NOT the case in the other 3 instances. They were all ‚Äúfreak moments‚Äù of my jaw misaligning slightly‚Äîstubbing my toe when my cat attempted to trip and purrder me, when I bent to reach into my fridge, and when I got into my car, respectively. I cannot express how small/minor/un-jarring these instances were. We‚Äôre talking minor bumps, not jolts or clacks. 

Prior to this, the temporaries were on for 6 weeks but broke four times in that time period, to various degrees. These were even lighter disturbances‚Äîchewing spaghetti and smiling slightly off kilter. I was instructed to purchase dental glue from Amazon if the temps broke off and I couldn‚Äôt get an appointment right away, which was a cyanoacrylate that smelled suspiciously like Super Glue. 

My veneers are ‚Äúunder warranty‚Äù within the first two years of application, minus a $200 3D lab workup fee for each new set. So far I have only had the one #10 veneer re-created, the others have been reattached by my dentist with fresh etching and curing, etc. 

My dentist was very kind for the first two temporary fixes and the first permanent fix, but she seemed frustrated/annoyed by the following repairs. But I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs ‚Äî fair? Reasonable? It‚Äôs her work, after all, and my most recent/current insurance policy no longer covers her practice, so it‚Äôs coming out of pocket for me. 

I am fastidious with my 6-mo appointments; I brush with a Sonicare One and Crest 3D White Charcoal; I floss (not as consistently as I should, admittedly, but I do so very meticulously;) I use CloSys mouthwash; I wear a dentist-fitted night guard; I scrape my tongue; and I don‚Äôt drink, smoke, or drink coffee. My one vice is Diet Coke, which even that I try to drink from a reusable tumbler with straw. 

**TL;DR: I feel like I am being a nuisance to my dentist now, and like I‚Äôm being made to feel bad about my dental habits and how often my veneers are breaking, like it‚Äôs a personal failing I should work on. But I don‚Äôt understand why THESE veneers are breaking so easily and so often, when the ones I got in my teens lasted 20 years.**

What am I doing wrong? What should I do moving forward? I‚Äôm worried about the natural tooth underneath, and the fact that I have to have even more etching applied and more cement scraped off at my gumline.

But I think I landed in the wrong century.","I‚Äôm a 40-year-old father of two little princesses. Their mother, my ex-wife left us, saying she wanted to live her youth. I didn‚Äôt fight. I just took responsibility for the kids and never looked back. I thank God every day that I have my daughters. They are the only true thing left in this life.

But let‚Äôs be real: **life isn‚Äôt fair.**  
Especially not when you live in a country like Turkey, in this era.

I‚Äôve been to more than 20 countries. I lived long enough in some of them to understand how they breathe. After 4 years in Western countries, I returned to Turkey. And what I found‚Ä¶ it broke me.  
**Total cultural collapse.**  
People don‚Äôt know who they are anymore. Everyone‚Äôs confused, posturing, angry, performative.  
I read about this phase in history books.  
Europe lived this crisis 30 years ago.  
Now it‚Äôs Turkey‚Äôs turn, and I‚Äôve come back to it in its ugliest phase.

Everyone pretends to be religious, but no one understands what God truly is.  
Everyone plays ‚Äúmodern,‚Äù but with hearts full of emptiness.  
They pray in the morning and text their exes at night.  
They say ‚Äúlove is sacred,‚Äù then have sex on the first date.  
They say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm loyal,‚Äù while juggling five backup lovers on rotation.

**It‚Äôs disgusting.**

I‚Äôve met more than 15 women in the last two years.  
Some were religious, some were secular, some smart, some soft, some educated, some broken.  
We dated for a few days‚Ä¶ sometimes weeks‚Ä¶ and I always ended up running.  
Not because I was scared, but because I was suffocating.

Last week, I thought I finally found *her*. We‚Äôd been talking for a month. We had deep conversations. She was secular, but spiritual. She invited me over for coffee.  
We hugged. We laid down.  
But I couldn‚Äôt do it. I didn‚Äôt want her body.  
I wanted our ***souls*** to connect first.

So, I left.  
She messaged me later: *‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what you want.‚Äù*  
No, lady.  
I know exactly what I want.  
You just can‚Äôt feel it because you‚Äôre lost in the sewer system of this broken city.

Look, I don‚Äôt claim to be pure.  
I‚Äôve had casual relationships too. I‚Äôve been weak. I‚Äôve given in.  
There‚Äôs too much demand around me. Sometimes it‚Äôs easy to lose track of yourself.  
But every time I gave in, I lost a piece of my breath.

Now?  
I‚Äôm suffocating.

Is this what love is now?  
You don‚Äôt even remember her name the next morning?  
You don‚Äôt feel her pain, her fear, her joy, just her skin?

I‚Äôm sorry if this sounds harsh.  
But this is how I see it.  
And I‚Äôm tired of apologizing for being different.

I‚Äôm socially active.  
I try. I‚Äôm socially active. I do hiking, trekking, I go to book and poetry clubs, I teach English for free when I can.  
I go to the gym to respect my body.  
I pray every day, not in public, not for show but because I need to stay grounded.  
And yeah‚Ä¶ I sip a little whisky at night before I sleep. I talk to God. I talk to myself.

The rest of my life is business, and my daughters.

So why do I keep attracting women who just want sex?  
Why do I feel like ***a pile of trash that only draws flies?***

Sometimes I think, ‚Äúmaybe 99% of people can‚Äôt be wrong.‚Äù  
Maybe I should just accept it.  
Maybe I should go get my ‚Äúbody count‚Äù like the rest.  
No emotions. Just numbers.  
But I can‚Äôt.  
Even if that‚Äôs the new normal, I‚Äôd rather be ***abnormal.***

Maybe I‚Äôm just in the wrong garden.

Calling out to the wrong butterflies.

1jv1jgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1jv1jgt/struggle_with_house_guests_people_staying/,Struggle with House Guests / People Staying,"I've been really struggling lately with house guests. I love the idea of people visiting, but the practicality of it exhausts me. I live in a lovely flat with 2 bedrooms with my partner. It's not huge, but it's big enough. I work from home, in the spare bedroom. The spare bedroom has a kingsize spare bed and my desk. I love my workspace, and I really struggle when people visit because I then have to work in a different space, which is usually the living room, which is also a 'shared space' that guests then want to hang out in.

My partner is a chef and works out of the house during the day. I've explained to him that I find guests staying really hard because I then fall behind with work or feel really exhausted because I don't even get a minute of 'down time' - he has a commute to recharge and be alone, and he also gets out of the house. I think I see my home as my safe space where I can unmask and I find that near impossible when guests stay.

When guests stay, I end up feeling like I need to host EVEN if I'm working, especially if they come into the living room where I'm working. I end up making them breakfast and coffee, then working, then stopping to make them lunch, then working, then I finish work and immediately have to go into socialising.

The biggest issue right now is figuring out a solution because my partner LOVES having guests. We live in a city that's new so people visit us a lot, and both of us live far from home, so family comes to visit too.

The reason I write this is because we had a fight last night because I started to have a meltdown about our friend who is coming to stay while she recovers from surgery. Ultimately, I agreed to it and I want to do it, but I also suddenly felt so overwhelmed by the whole thing. I won't have any space to myself, it feels like that anyway because I will have to switch which room I'm working in (whether she's lying in bed recovering or sitting on the sofa in the living room recovering). And because I work from home, I'm taking on the brunt of daytime care.

The thing is, I do want to be a supportive friend, and I would never say no to helping a friend. But I'm also feeling really upset by how my partner reacted. He said I just need to get over it to be there for our friend, but I don't think he understands how difficult I find it. Even when I try to explain it. I don't know how to explain to him how it feels. And I guess I'm not sure what I'm looking for. He's overall incredibly supportive but found himself getting really upset at handling my emotions, saying he feels like he has to look after our friend and look after me all while working a full-time job. He has ADHD and is an extremely sociable person who will also crash dramatically when exhausted, it's like his brain just suddenly turns off. Whereas I mask highly and find myself having to mask the entire time guests are here - I feel like I can't just turn my brain off.

I think a huge part of this also comes down to being a woman and being high-masking. My partner is very supportive and is taking on the tasks like cooking dinner and evening care, but I think it's not the physicality of tasks... I don't know how to explain to him that it's my inability to be able to turn off for days on end when people stay... I find it so hard to explain.

I don't know why I'm posting this exactly. I'd love any ideas for how to cope better with houseguests and also how to cope with this coming situation of caring for our friend. I'd also love to hear if anyone has been through similar experiences and knows better how to verbalise what it is they're feeling. I don't even necessarily know what it is I'm feeling.",2,1744190534.0,autism,1,1.0,False

1. I‚Äôm not actually anxious, I‚Äôm ADHD. After a lifetime of being an anxious mess, this is life changing. 
2. My racing thoughts are not anxiety, they are a hyperactive mind. This one has been quite the realisation. I never saw the correlation until now. 
3. No more food noise. I don‚Äôt think about food. I‚Äôve spent a lifetime worried about every single fucking thing that goes into my mouth, and now I don‚Äôt care at all. I feel free from rewarding or punishing myself with food.
4. Craving adventure from my partner and melting down when I don‚Äôt get it. This is me craving stimulation. This need now has a real explanation behind it and I‚Äôm not just an introverted extrovert with a INFP personality type (the adventurer)
5. Work from home IS more chaotic than a regular work day as my daily structure gets all fucked up. 
6. Texting people back isn‚Äôt as hard when you‚Äôre not chronically overwhelmed by day to day life. 
7. If I miss my ‚Äúwindow‚Äù to get up because I have no plans that day, and I therefore can‚Äôt get going at all that day, I‚Äôm not lazy - I‚Äôm ADHD.  There is a reason why it feels like climbing to mt Everest to do anything.
8. Not enjoying typical ‚Äúfemale‚Äù social hang outs ( brunch, coffee dates etc) because of the intensity of eye contact and thinking about what to say. I need parallel play so I can enjoy an activity, and it‚Äôs better bonding for me as well. I despise sitting there just talking for hours on end it‚Äôs so fucking boring and stressful. 

Note: I know I‚Äôm in a bubble that‚Äôs gonna burst, but from my bubble, this is how I feel.

>\-me

The tragedy of my life:

Imagine waking up in the morning, motivated and ready to do some work. Everyday I would start drinking my coffee while watching TV a bit and feeling peace, and then I would head upstairs, meditate, write in my journal as I'm doing right now, and then get to work and spend my whole day in just pure productivity. I've become so passionate about my project that it feels effortless to work. I made new friends, new achievements, new milestones.

\-Yes indeed, this is the tragedy of my life, everything is perfect and I work tirelessly everyday.

Many other entrepreneurs fell into this HORRIBLE trap, and perhaps may never escape from this hell. I'am writing this as a warning to prevent you from falling into this yourself and making your dreams come true. My compassion is unprecedented... Who would want to win the game of life after all ? Read this 3 minute post and if you find value, apply it, if you don't, go ahead in your day and have fun. Let's now explain this TRAP.

>""Productivity is the natural state of life. Be happy and you will reconnect with life and its qualities.""

>\-me

# The first rule #1

to never fall into this trap is to always do the things that you hate and never do the things that you love. Having fun and doing activities you actually enjoy will give you too much energy. It will refuel you like crazy, to the point where it will feel natural to do work. Don't let the life energy flow into you, and do like the rest of the population, let the death energy master.

What I mean by that ? Productivity is the natural driving force of everything. If I were to close you in a room for a day and tell you to sit and do nothing, you probably couldn't. After a while you would want to get busy with something.

When you have fun in life, it will reconnect you the essence of life, leading you to be productive. You can't do that. Who would want to be productive and achieve greatness ? Do like the other people around you. Do a job that you hate the whole day, and then, instead of recharging yourself with activities you love, go scroll on Tik Tok for hours even though you know you don't exactly like it. I beg you, whatever you do, don't even think of going for a walk, meeting friends, playing a game you truly love, read a book... Just stay at the low energy level, so you can be unproductive the rest of the day. Don't even think of reconnecting with the life energy.

When you don't have fun, this is where you are with the death energy. Depression, lack of energy, lack of vision. Everything you do feels painful and horrible and staying in bed scrolling will feel so much easier. Let yourself be depressed, who would want anything else from life anyway?

So, please, be careful, don't even think of doing stuff you like or let yourself have pleasures. You may become too productive and unstoppable. You will have too much motivation, and working will feel so easy. Nobody wants to fall in a trap where all your goals and desire can be achieved and where you are the best person you have ever been. Happier, kinder, more productive, focused...

How to make sure you don't fall into the trap ? When you wake up, don't ask yourself what would I want to do today ? What would make me happy? Perhaps you will see that sitting under the sun for ten minutes feels enjoyable, don't even think of that, this will fix your motivation center, making you more able to work. Perhaps a good cup of coffee in the morning while reading feels interesting? Don't even do it. When in life your feel your energy level is decreasing, just go scroll on Tik Tok and do meaningless stuff. Don't listen to yourself or do the things that actually brings energy to yourself. After all happiness is our compass in life. Who would want to reconnect with the source ?

Of course, I‚Äôm joking.

But isn‚Äôt it eerie how many people live this way? This is a satire obviously, do the opposite, that is what I'm doing in life and it is awesome. Just remember that there is no happiness in immorality or toxicity, and that only healthy and kind happiness should be sought.

This article is part of my personal journal, I came to realize that what I'm writing could be useful for many people, so here I am sharing it!

I've made four separate grocery orders to panda. they've managed to cock up four serapate times no matter when or how i place the order.

one big order? half of the items listed as out of stock. refund still pending bank processing SOP. 

split order into two smaller separate orders? half the items listed as ""out of stock"". again. COD this time. 

no notification each time. no text. no email. no call. this last order just one the
lonely email AFTER the order arrived and has been paid for. 

Things I've learned. 
1. if you make an order, check back often especially closer to the scheduled delivery time. 
2. expect panda to be late. always. 
3. if no rider is assigned it's easier to get your orders cancelled and vouchers refunded.
4. panda wll  not refund your voucher and WILL drag things out until rider is assigned or has picked up your order. rider will magically accelerate while you're arguing with panda.
 CS. then CS will say ""YOU SHALL NOT PASS! THIS KENOT BE!"" and end chat.  
4.2 check back often. cancel before rider assigned.
use COD. request voucher refund. Place pre order. 
5. Ordered from pandamart, the seal on my coffee was broken. cap was clearly removed. panda still investigating this hot potato
6. they say ""action will be taken"".
-->> I'm still waiting. 

ya man....  i just want my groceries for the month. I've placed pre order, late order, early order, small order -- every order same result. 

it's like there's a judgemental .... person,  suka suka hati Xde the items on my list. ""hari ni tak boleh ayam. hari lalu bawang tak boleh, garam tak boleh. you sudah ada daging. Saya, Sudah. Kata  -- CUKUP!!"".  

(it's really feels like a judgemental person gate keeping my grocery choices. you've already got this. you cannot have that. whachu gonna do with this???? huh huh?)

i like panda cause my ringgit goes further than it does on grab and having groceries delivered is amazing! 

anyone else face these issues ?

I‚Äôm a solo developer based in Sri Lanka working on a small digital product / micro SaaS. As expected, Stripe isn‚Äôt available here, and platforms like Paddle or Lemon Squeezy ask for things like business registration, social media links, and a full landing page.

Local gateways like PayHere and Webxpay also don‚Äôt support international payments unless you're a registered business.

So I‚Äôm looking for some advice from others in a similar boat:

Has anyone used Gumroad, Ko-fi, or Buy Me a Coffee successfully from Sri Lanka?

Is PayPal + Wise still a viable combo to receive payouts into local bank accounts?

Are there any other platforms or clever workarounds that have worked for individuals?

Maybe during my time at school, some report or a bachelor thesis. Apart from that I dabbled a bit in world building for my TTRPG campaign.

The last year has been really tough. I've reached a low point in my life and had to build myself up from scratch, battle through depression, getting diagnosed with ADHD and some other things.

The thoughts in my head started to consume me. I self reflected on everything to the point my therapist didn't know how to help me, because I already knew her attempts at giving me advice.

So I tried a desperate hail mary attempt at quieting my head. I started to read philosophy books. Dostoyevsky, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer etc. The classic clich√© of existentialism and nihilism.

Soon after I started to write. No goal in mind. Just trying to remove my thoughts, giving them a physical body and writing them down. Externalising all my pain, my assumptions of life and what it all means. At first some wild concepts and frameworks of my thinking patterns and how i interpret the world.

Suddenly I had the urge to write a story. Combining the fragmented concept in a coherent story. It was just for myself and I never intended to show it to anyone.

Last night I let my wife read the first two chapters and the outline of the story up until the epilogue. She started crying while reading it and asked me if I am okay.

Apparently my writing struck a very deep and personal nerve. She really liked the chatacter, the tone and my style. The text was able to translate my pain and transfer it to the reader. I reread my words with her feedback in mind and I understood why she was asking if I am okay. My writing is dark, cold, not talking around a subject and stripping it bare. I didn't know this kind of sadness was bottled up inside me. I was horrified.

I take this as a compliment, I guess ?

Edit: I guess people might want to know what I am talking about. So here is a short summary:

On a quiet Sunday morning, a man wakes with the kind of tired that sleep can‚Äôt fix. Nearing forty, with nothing left to prove and no one left to perform for, he begins his day not with urgency, but with ritual - brewing coffee, straightening pictures, rolling a cigarette he has no intention of smoking.

A story of stillness, of memory, of quietly letting go. Set over the course of a single day, it follows a man confronting the weight of a life lived and the silence that follows. But even as he prepares for an ending, a knock at the door reminds him that the world, indifferent and alive, is still just beyond the threshold.",5,1744189824.0,writing,6,0.73,False

Very long.,"My Ex(30) and I(34)were together for almost three and a half years. The first two years were crazy. The relationship was so good, sex was incredible, everything felt right. We had amazing holidays, did fun activities together. We supported each other through bad times and celebrated through the good ones. 

Then we bought a home together and it started going downhill. I found myself being relied on for most things: and repairs in the house, most of the cleaning, any admin to do with the house, any admin to do with my ex or myself in general. 

I know this is stupid but, we decided moving in (we had cats) that I was better at dealing with poop and she was better at dealing with vomit. So I'd clean up poop and she'd clean up vomit. One obviously was more common that the other. When a cat did vomit for whatever reason, though my ex would get rid of the initial vomit and leave the stain on the carpet stating that she ""didn't know how"" to scrub it off. I showed her, and she just kind of nodded and later down the line just said I did it better. This is an example for so many other things. 

She wouldn't take me out for a meal on my birthday unless I expressly told her what to do, down to where to book. I don't like having to do that. I wanted her to try. I flew her ass to Scotland on her 30th, booked all the tours and where to stay without her ever having to bother with the details because it was her birthday.

 She started touching me in ways I did not like. She'd flick and suck on my ears, twist and fondle my breasts, try and stick her hands and fingers up my ass at every. Single. Opportunity. It was every time I was sat next to her for more than 3 seconds. I told her I really didn't like what she was doing, but she didn't stop until I physically stopped her and moved. It made me not want to be touched by her at all.

Then because of work stuff, my back started to get really painful and I eventually slipped a disk. At this point we were having less and less sex and she was getting upset about it. 

When my back went I could barely walk and needed someone. She kind of left me to rott. The house became awful. Our poor cats started pissing in the plant pots because their litters weren't being changed. 

When I could go back to work I would white knuckle it through the day and just want to rest my back until I had to go back the next day, but there was so much to do in the house. My back kept re-slipping. I had to take more time off work. 

My ex gave me shit about not doing physio and picked me up from work the majority of the time, but that was kind of it. She also told me I needed to pull my weight more around the house and that I was a walrus (I had gained allot of weight because I couldn't excesize and we kept eating takeout as she couldn't be bothered to cook most nights and I was constantly in pain).

She got so lazy that she stopped showering, stopped brushing her teeth. She smelled. I couldn't kiss her. I didn't want to be close to her. 

I was miserable. She kept asking why we weren't having sex. Mentioning how long it had been. Asked me if I was asexual, how I felt about having a third or opening up the relationship. I was on serious pain pills that kept me pretty dopey pretty much all of the time, so a bunch of this I kind of passively went through. I was at a really volnerable point. 

We fall out one week, I tell her I want some space. She needs to sort out her own meals, I'll sort out my own. I tell her she needs to get her shit together. I tell her to spend some time without me with her friends. 

A couple days later we had made up fine and there was this party at her sister's that we had both been invited to. I told her I wanted to go still (I was really tight with her sister and sister's husband) but I could tell she didn't want me to, so I stayed home and told her to have fun. It's the one event we didn't go to together. 

Little did I know that someone there had been waiting for an opening with my ex. Someone we had known as an aquaintance, that had clocked my ex years ago and was just waiting for a crack in our relationship. 

My ex made plans to stay the night at her house during the week, and spend Valentine's with this person. I knew what was happening so I broke up our relationship. 

A few weeks later I go over to my place that I'm still paying for that I no longer live in. My back healed after I moved out - when I could rest it properly.

We're supposed to talk about the house and just hang out because we miss each other's company. We end up having a few drinks. We end up hooking up. She tells me she's been sleeping with this person. I'm not surprised but I'm upset. I stay the night and we pretend like none of it ever happened and it's like it was years ago again. That larger than life love that fills you up from head to toe. We say it's the last time and say goodbye. 

About a month later we need to meet up to talk about the house. She also tells me she got me a birthday present that she wants to give me. I suggest we don't meet in her house, I suggest coffee, she suggests the pub near by. I concede and we go to the pub. I say one pint, she says two. She tells me she's officially with this other woman. After two pints I'm fine with three. After three I suggest we buy a couple of big beers from the shop and go talk by the pier before heading home.

She complements me on my weight loss. I've not been able to really enjoy food since the breakup because of how hurt I've been and at that point I had lost like 25lbs in less than a couple months. It's not the worst thing to have happened. 

 I tell her tearfully how she let me down. She apologizes profusely. She tells me how the sex with her current partner is not anywhere near as good as it was with me. She tells me she still loves me. She tells me it still feels like she's cheating on me when she's with her new girlfriend. I fucking take the bait. We end up back at hers on what used to be my couch. It the middle of it she says ""I think (name of gf) is coming over soon"". I freak out and throw my clothes back on and leave. 

She's terrible, but my whole body is still loyal to her. I can't bring myself to date. The idea of someone else totally doesn't compute. I wake up every morning feeling like I lost a chunk of myself. It makes me sick when I think about her with the person she's with now. I know this is petty, but she's not even good-looking. Like she left me for this unattractive woman who she doesn't even vibe with on a chemical level? Why are we even here? 

I'm broken. Deeply broken and I struggle every day. I told her that we can't be friends and I can't see her again because I don't feel in control and I don't want to be her bit on the side any more than I already have been. 

It feels like what I imagine addiction feels like. Its chest-crushing, gut-wrenching. 

I've never been this messed up over a break up. Nowhere near. I don't feel sane. I'm struggling to control my emotions, plastering a smile on my face everyday until I can crawl into bed and re-live it all. 

Her day finishes and she curls up on the mattress that I diligently researched to give us both the best night sleep, next to some other woman. 

I feel weak. It's so painful. She fucked me up man. I let her fuck me up. 

I wish I could just erase the whole thing. I wish we had never met and I had just met someone who would have treated me with respect. 

I wish I could hate her.",7,1744189789.0,ActualLesbiansOver25,2,0.89,False

Volkov despised any additions to coffee and always proudly ordered his caffeine fix black. At first, when he noticed the creamy drink in Schmidt‚Äôs cup, he jumped at the opportunity to make fun of his partner, but with time came to terms with this sacrilege. He also insisted on only taking up standing tables at the eatery they frequented for lunch in fear of being seen as a couple on a date. Despite knowing virtually nothing about his partner‚Äôs personal life, he assumed that sharing a sitting-down table with a man would harm Schmidt‚Äôs dating prospects.¬†



Or so he told himself.



With time, though, it just became their thing: choosing a standing table or just taking up a bench outdoors if none were available. Mike didn‚Äôt question it, always happy to accommodate his partner in a small matter like this.¬†



Today was no different. Schmidt had just brought their order when Volkov was checking his messages from the lab guys.



‚ÄúThe fingerprints match‚Äù, Jim said. ‚ÄúThe note was definitely written with Marino‚Äôs finger.‚Äù



Schmidt hummed in acknowledgement, setting their little table as neatly as the cheap fast-food cardboard packaging would allow. Volkov lifted the plastic lid off one of the cups and TSKed when he saw creamed coffee as if it offended his very being. Picking up the other one, he theatrically grabbed his meat pie from the plate, ripping the greasy paper on purpose and ignored Schmidt‚Äôs accusing glance.



‚ÄúThe DNA test isn‚Äôt done yet, though,‚Äù he continued, taking a big bite.



Schmidt, relieved that Volkov would keep silent for a moment while he chewed, carefully unwrapped his own pie, taking time to enjoy the aroma first. After the morning visit to the butchery, he made sure to get the mushroom filling, and the unfamiliar scent filled him with almost childish giddiness. He knew being completely quiet made his partner‚Äôs incessantly working mind short-circuit and double down on the talking, though.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised you got your usual meat pie, to be honest,‚Äù he smiled, seeing Volkov‚Äôs angular jaws working on overdrive.



‚ÄúHummffghuermmgh, Shmiff,‚Äù came the answer, and the younger detective hid his smile behind a gulp from his own paper cup.



As he enjoyed his meal in relative peace, it wasn‚Äôt just Volkov‚Äôs mind and jaws that were working at their limit. Jim couldn‚Äôt tear his eyes off the taller man‚Äôs Adam‚Äôs apple as he swallowed his cream-tainted coffee. Distractingly, he scrubbed his own neck, which needed a shave and, if he was being honest, a good scrub with soap. It was unfair that Schmidt managed to look so put-together and do as good a job as himself while also being in such good shape! He wondered how this peacock had enough time in a day for the gym, the dressing up, cooking picturesque breakfasts AND writing his reports on time?

He gripped his untarnished coffee and as he forced a gulp down his throat, a runaway drop escaped the corner of his lips and ran down his t-shirt, ruining the white fabric. Well, it wasn‚Äôt as white as the day before yesterday when he picked it up from the washing, but at least he didn‚Äôt look like a slob wearing it. Until now.

What he didn‚Äôt notice was Schmidt‚Äôs keen eyes that followed that drop every millimeter of its way, committing the sight to memory for later.



\*\*\*

  


‚ÄúI‚Äôve searched the Internet far and wide but I couldn‚Äôt make sense of it all. We need a textbook of Chinese‚Äù, Volkov said, rubbing his tired eyes after intensely staring at his screens for another couple hours.¬†



‚ÄúOr we could find a tutor who specialises in Chinese calligraphy‚Äù, offered Schmidt, finishing up his weekly report.¬†



They of course went the Volkov route first.



The gruff detective looked out of place in the library. He thought they still looked stuffy and dusty, full of decrepit ladies who shushed you for so much as breathing. This one was different though: some kids were on their laptops, happily clicking away essays, one of the doors was invitingly left ajar to let in more people to a room with some lecture going on, and ‚Äî aha! ‚Äî there was even a coffee vending machine with snacks in the corner.



The front desk of the reading section had a woman in glasses, just as ageless at first glance as one could possibly imagine. She was occupied by scanning a pile of books and carefully putting them into columns according to some mysterious pattern. Her small hands with blunt nails worked quickly and carefully and as she lifted a pile of about ten books and took it away towards the shelves, Volkov noticed a tattoo on her forearm: an artsy ampersand with something written around it in a whimsical font.



‚Äú*That‚Äôs dedication,*‚Äù he thought.



Schmidt caught up after stalling for a minute next to the door to the lecture hall. He came up to the desk: it was his turn to do the asking this time.



‚ÄúHow can I help you, gentlemen?‚Äù the woman asked when she got back, a slight sheen of sweat on her forehead from the effort. ‚ÄúWait, don‚Äôt tell me: you are not here for reading recommendations.‚Äù



‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt,‚Äù Schmidt admitted, flashing his ID. ‚ÄúWe are from Bellenhaven police, want to ask you a couple of questions.‚Äù



‚ÄúMichael Schmidt,‚Äù she read. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a last name with a long history. Did you know it‚Äôs a German version of the English ‚ÄòSmith‚Äô?‚Äù



‚ÄúI do, actually, and yes, I have German roots. Can I have your name, miss‚Ä¶?‚Äù



‚ÄúWilde. Juniper Wilde, but everyone calls me June,‚Äù she chirped.



‚ÄúWilde as in‚Ä¶‚Äù Schmidt started.



‚ÄúYes! Like Oscar Wilde!‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat a coincidence,‚Äù the man laughed. ‚ÄúI guess you were born to do this job, weren‚Äôt you?‚Äù



He caught Volkov‚Äôs heavy stare in the corner of his vision. What exactly made his partner mad wasn‚Äôt clear but Schmidt knew he wasn‚Äôt doing anything wrong. In fact, building rapport with a possible lead was an important step in the detective handbook.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve read all his books, Miss Wilde,‚Äù he went on.



‚ÄúJune,‚Äù she corrected.



‚ÄúJune,‚Äù Schmidt agreed.



Behind him, Volkov cleared his throat forcibly.



‚Äú... but what do you have on Asian languages? My partner and I are in the middle of a case and need some advice on Chinese handwriting.‚Äù



‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt much but we do have a couple of tracing notebooks to practice the characters,‚Äù she quickly typed a request in the laptop.



‚ÄúNo, June, that‚Äôs not quite what we need,‚Äù Schmidt said and the librarian looked up with a bright smile women always had in stock for him.



Volkov was getting impatient.



‚ÄúWe actually have a piece of writing in what we think is Chinese and we couldn‚Äôt translate it. So we thought you might know how‚Äî‚Äù



It was the ‚Äúmight‚Äù that snapped Volkov‚Äôs patience. Huffing and puffing, he closed the distance with the desk in a couple of forceful steps and put his ID face down on the wooden surface.



‚ÄúIt will take all day, Mikey, let me do it,‚Äù he tossed, but before he had a chance to continue, June‚Äôs eyes rounded and she smiled even more.



‚ÄúWait, wait, wait,‚Äù ‚Äî she flapped her palms in the air to stop him. ‚ÄúYou have a very peculiar pronunciation, sir. Don‚Äôt tell me your name yet. Let me guess, your colleague here comes from Germany, but you‚Ä¶ Eastern Europe?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Volkov said, clearly disoriented with someone else asking him questions for a change.



Schmidt, knowing that June was close, still forced his face into a neutral expression. He didn‚Äôt want to spoil the experiment.



‚ÄúYes!‚Äù June went on. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs usually thought that native speakers of Polish, Slovak or Russian struggle with English ‚ÄòR‚Äô sounds but in fact, your soft ‚ÄòL‚Äô is usually the giveaway.‚Äù



Volkov resisted the urge to cover his mouth with his palm. The last time he felt like this was when his mother scolded him for lying as a teenager.



‚ÄúMy soft what?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou see, detectives, the English language only has the hard ‚ÄòL‚Äô sound, softening it is a feature of some languages in that area, ‚Äù she beamed at Volkov like a kid. ‚ÄúYou said ‚ÄòIt will take all day, let me handle it‚Äô which has a bunch of ‚ÄòL‚Äô sounds. Most of them you pronounced correctly save for the one in ‚Äòlet‚Äô. It sounded very soft, which is not quite how a native speaker of English would say it.‚Äù



Schmidt had to admit he had noticed small idiosyncrasies in his partner‚Äôs speech but could never put his finger on it. He knew that Volkov grew up here after moving from his home country as a young child. He picked up the language very well. But apparently, not perfectly.



‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ uh,‚Äù ‚Äî the older detective seemed a bit lost but quickly recovered. ‚Äî ‚ÄúNonsense, it‚Äôs just a slip.‚Äù



‚ÄúStill,‚Äù June insisted. ‚ÄúIs your name Ivan by any chance?‚Äù ‚Äî she glanced at the ID as if it was an early Christmas present.



‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs James,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnyway, we need to‚Ä¶‚Äù



Schmidt just couldn‚Äôt help himself, ‚ÄúJames Volkov. He‚Äôs Russian.‚Äù



‚ÄúVolkov, huh?‚Äù June looked ecstatic. ‚ÄúComes from ‚Äòwolf‚Äô. I was right!‚Äù



Volkov‚Äôs glare seared Schmidt‚Äôs face. Schmidt met his eyes with a calm look but inside, he rejoiced. Not often could one see someone play a symphony on his partner‚Äôs strings like that. Even if it was a lucky coincidence, he knew: this woman could be a valuable asset to their investigation. He could only hope her language prowess included Chinese.



While Volkov recovered, he took out the folded piece of paper with the scribbles of the ‚Äúgrain‚Äù character and carefully spread it on the desk. June‚Äôs eyes, instantly drawn to the ink, greedily scanned the paper.¬†



‚ÄúWe need to know what this character might mean,‚Äù Schmidt said. ‚ÄúThe online dictionaries and translators say it means ‚Äògrain‚Äô but it doesn‚Äôt make sense for our case. Can you tell us anything else about it?‚Äù



June spinned the paper upside-down, looked at its backside and brought it to her face so close that it looked like she was going to sniff the writing.



¬†‚ÄúIt does look Chinese,‚Äù she confirmed. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs useless, I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù



‚ÄúOh, is that so?‚Äù Volkov perked up before Schmidt pinned him with a sharp sideways glance.¬†



‚ÄúCan I ask why?‚Äù he said calmly, turning back to June whose eyes jumped from one detective to the other now.



‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she said, just a hint of a sly smile gracing her lips. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt written by a native Chinese speaker so it‚Äôs likely just a bored doodle.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúYou see, detectives, when one learns to write Chinese characters, they quickly find out that there‚Äôs an order to the strokes. You must follow the order of each line for graceful and fluent writing. This ‚Äòcharacter‚Äô you‚Äôre showing me is just someone trying to copy one. Or just coming up with a pretty symmetric design. It must be a coincidence that it looks like a character.‚Äù



She made a helpless gesture, and shrugged, showing that that was about it.



Schmidt‚Äôs ‚Äútold you so‚Äù look wasn‚Äôt appreciated by Volkov in the slightest. In fact, the shorter detective went into the offensive and made another attempt, ‚ÄúLook again. It must mean something.‚Äù



June slid the paper back towards the guests.



‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do more without knowing where it came from, I‚Äôm afraid. Every linguist depends on context more than anything. Is it a suspect‚Äôs handwriting sample? Then all I can say about them is that this isn‚Äôt a native Chinese speaker. Otherwise they would know the stroke order.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true,‚Äù Schmidt smiled and thought he heard Volkov‚Äôs teeth grind. ‚ÄúBecause I wrote this. But it‚Äôs a copy I made of a very important document. Can you please look again? It will help us immensely.‚Äù



‚ÄúIf you show me the document itself, I might help.‚Äù



‚ÄúOut of the question,‚Äù Volkov cut in.



June looked almost hurt.



‚ÄúCan I talk to you for a minute?‚Äù Schmidt said. ‚ÄúExcuse us, miss Wilde.‚Äù



They went outside to avoid disturbing the quiet of the library. Schmidt could tell his partner needed to calm down. It took a minute and a puff of cigarette smoke.



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give me that look. I know I‚Äôm not supposed to smoke near a library,‚Äù Volkov said.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going to arrest you, you know,‚Äù the other smiled. He knew Volkov could be reasoned with. It just required some time and patience.



‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt show her the files, you know that.‚Äù



‚ÄúIf we appoint her a linguistic consultant with Captain, we can.‚Äù



Puff.



‚ÄúThe paperwork will take weeks. All for her to say that it really means ‚Äògrain‚Äô.‚Äù



‚ÄúJim, I feel some unreasonable resentment in you. Are you upset she noticed your accent?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo. Of course not, idiot. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù



Schmidt waited.



Puff.



‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just too‚Ä¶into this stuff. I‚Äôve seen it before. This is a bad sign for an expert. Her enthusiasm can damage the investigation. She‚Äôs sitting in that room, with nothing to do for years, of course she wants something exciting to happen. No, Mike, she‚Äôs not a good lead.‚Äù



Volkov breathed in another lungful of smoke and held it in for several seconds, looking at the people passing by. He couldn‚Äôt quite put his finger on why exactly he needed to calm down, though. He just knew his explanation made him want to cover his mouth again.



Schmidt was silent. Then, he reached out and grabbed the cigarette from his partner‚Äôs fingers. Volkov‚Äôs heart skipped a beat at the skin contact and then another, when he saw Schmidt take a long drag before stubbing the butt into a trash bin.



‚ÄúI still think she might be useful,‚Äù he heard Schmidt say before disappearing into the library again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell her to phone the precinct if she comes up with anything else.‚Äù



Volkov pinched the bridge of his nose and hoped it looked like a gesture of annoyance and not an attempt to hide the tremor in his hands.



\*\*\*



June Wilde was making herself look busy when Schmidt came back inside. It didn‚Äôt take him long to realise she had been trying to spy on them out of the window. Exactly how much she had seen was hard to say because of the heavy shelves that lined the walls and cutting off direct access to the glass, though. She tried acting innocent, loading another pile of books into her hands and huffing with a fake effort.



‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt help noticing your tattoo, June,‚Äù Schmidt smiled. ‚ÄúAn ampersand. You must really love languages.‚Äù



‚ÄúNot just languages, linguistics mostly,‚Äù she beamed, dropping her act in an instant. ‚ÄúBut forensic linguistics is a passion of mine. It‚Äôs so underappreciated!‚Äù



‚ÄúForensic linguistics? Is this what you did to my partner back there?‚Äù



‚ÄúSort of. But it can do so much more. Oh, detective Schmidt, please, let me help your investigation!‚Äù



He shook his head, ‚ÄúI really can‚Äôt show you the files, it would be a huge violation of the rules.‚Äù



She deflated like a balloon.



‚ÄúHowever,‚Äù he went on, winking. ‚ÄúI can show you some of my own doodles. Let me know if they remind you of anything.‚Äù



He gave June a folded napkin from the cafe he and Volkov went to at lunch and she accepted it with both hands, like a treasure.



‚ÄúI will, Detective! I‚Äôll do my best!‚Äù



The ‚Äúdoodles‚Äù was his best rendition of the full note with his phone number on the other side. Schmidt knew Jim would lose his mind if he found out.



\*\*\*



Volkov hadn‚Äôt given him a lift that evening, apparently still mad about the cigarette or his own accent slipping out.



It didn‚Äôt matter to Schmidt, who was used to his partner‚Äôs temper and switching gears at a snap. Volkov wasn‚Äôt fooling anyone acting all annoyed: the moment their fingers brushed, his pupils said everything Schmidt suspected long ago. This act of disrespect, both the snatch and the direct disagreement left Volkov breathless, wide-eyed and craving more.

But because his partner was a coward, it was too early to act on it. For now, he had‚Ä¶¬†

‚Ä¶ his own fantasy.



The sheets were cool, feeling so nice under his freshly-showered skin, and Schmidt could surrender to the exhaustion of the busy day right there and then, but the slideshow of the pictures he had collected in his mind‚Äôs eye demanded immediate attention. He stretched on the bed, only covered by a damp towel around his hips, and let the fabric massage his back muscles. Just like enjoying a fresh pie started with the scent, taking time to enjoy himself wasn‚Äôt a straightforward business for Schmidt.¬†



He savoured the image of the coffee drop he had committed to memory: the way it ran through Volkov‚Äôs stubble, pooled over his naked collarbone for a second and then disappeared into his t-shirt. He wondered what kind of noise his partner would make if it was his tongue that ran the same route. Would Volkov freeze, afraid to breathe and just let Schmidt take what he wanted? Or would he fight instead? ‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you think you‚Äôre doing, Mike?‚Äù he‚Äôd say and throw a punch. Or perhaps, Volkov would melt right into his touch, submitting without a fight?



Schmidt turned on his stomach and rolled his hips into the mattress, testing the waters. It felt good, but could be better.



He imagined, instead of taking the cigarette from Volkov‚Äôs hand, grabbing his wrist with one hand and his stocky waist with the other and crushing their mouths together, licking the smoke and bewilderment off of his partner‚Äôs lips. Volkov would definitely start a fight then, because they were in public.¬†

The idea of holding down Jim as he fought to free himself from the stronger man‚Äôs grip stirred Schmidt‚Äôs body further. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fight me, Jim, you know it‚Äôs in vain,‚Äù he‚Äôd say, pressing Volkov to the glass door of the library for everyone to see who he belongs to. ‚ÄúOr should I say ‚ÄòIvan‚Äô?‚Äù¬†

Schmidt imagined the look on Volkov‚Äôs face if he said that. His eyes wide, hazy, baffled, with a hint of pain at the bottom. He rolled his hips into the bed again and hardly held in a grunt, shutting his eyes in search of more, more, more of Volkov.



He imagined fighting his partner again, how they would roll around on the ground, their bodies pressing in the most inconvenient places. How he‚Äôd overpower Volkov and bite into his pulse just under his earlobe, hearing the man groan, trying to mask it as a cry of pain. But the hardness at Schmidt‚Äôs thigh would be proof that he wants it.



Schmidt‚Äôs phone dinged with a text notification. He debated leaving it unread but knew he couldn‚Äôt focus in case it was something important. With his right hand occupied, he fished it with the other out of the sheets.



It was Volkov. A voice recording.



Play.



‚ÄúFuck, Mike, my car won‚Äôt start. I‚Äôm gonna be late tomorrow, gotta get it fixed first thing in the morning. Just letting ya know.‚Äù



‚Äúok‚Äù Schmidt texted back.



Still on his belly, he stuffed a pillow between his thighs, left thumb hovering over the ‚Äúplay‚Äù button.

Shreya, sharp and meticulous, had just joined the product team of a growing startup. She was the kind who color-coded everything, even her sticky notes. Prateek, on the other hand, was a senior in the design department ‚Äî laid-back, quick-witted, and with a reputation for charming his way through deadlines.



Their first real interaction was over a bug in a shared dashboard. Shreya had pinged him, a little curtly, asking for a fix. He replied with a meme and the solution. She rolled her eyes ‚Äî but saved the meme.



Over the next few weeks, they found themselves paired on more cross-functional projects. Where Shreya brought structure, Prateek brought spontaneity. They disagreed, debated, and eventually delivered. Somewhere between timelines and team calls, they started exchanging playlists and snack recommendations.



It was never a big, dramatic moment ‚Äî just a growing comfort.



One evening, Shreya stayed late to wrap up a deck for a last-minute presentation. Prateek noticed the light still on in the meeting room. He dropped by with two cups of chai from the vendor outside.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not leaving till you finish this, are you?‚Äù he smirked.



‚ÄúI can‚Äôt. The founder wants it in his inbox by 9 a.m. sharp,‚Äù she sighed.



He pulled up a chair. ‚ÄúOkay then. Let‚Äôs kill this deck together.‚Äù



They worked side by side that evening. It became a thing after that ‚Äî occasional late nights, quiet banter, long walks to the chai stall. Soon, the post-work strolls extended to parks and neighborhoods. What started as ‚ÄúI need to walk off this biryani‚Äù became ‚ÄúWant to meet near the lake at 7?‚Äù



They were careful in office ‚Äî professional, polite, with just a hint of something unspoken. But outside, over street food, sunsets, and shared rants about client calls, they were slowly falling for each other.



One Friday, Prateek casually mentioned he‚Äôd be in Goa that weekend with a few college friends. Shreya surprised him with, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cool. I‚Äôll be in Gokarna. Solo trip.‚Äù



He blinked. ‚ÄúYou travel solo?‚Äù



She grinned. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù



That weekend, their texts were more frequent. Photos of beaches, bookshops, bad WiFi complaints, and sunset comparisons. Somewhere in the middle of it, Prateek caught himself smiling at her texts a little too long.



On Monday, Shreya walked into office with a tan and a tiny shell bracelet. Prateek didn‚Äôt say much. He just pulled out a fridge magnet from his bag and placed it on her desk ‚Äî a cartoon crab with a goofy face.



‚ÄúFor your solo fridge,‚Äù he said, trying to sound casual.



It was during a team offsite in Lonavala that something shifted.



On a misty evening, the two found themselves alone on a balcony, watching the hills disappear into fog. She was wrapped in a shawl, he in a hoodie. The silence between them was easy.



‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù she said quietly, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve become my favorite person.‚Äù



He turned to her, genuinely surprised.



‚ÄúReally?‚Äù



She nodded. ‚ÄúYou make things lighter. I didn‚Äôt know I needed that.‚Äù



For once, Prateek was at a loss for words. He just reached out and held her hand ‚Äî simple, honest.



After that, the pace quickened.



There were movie nights, weekend treks, double dates with unsuspecting friends, and whispered laughter in the middle of boring webinars. He learned to like filter coffee; she started tolerating EDM.



But the twist?

https://preview.redd.it/fql3e9ctwrte1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d308a48c6044ccb28000c2c07501ea911315d24

It came from Shreya.



One evening, under fairy lights at a rooftop caf√©, she slid a note across the table. Just a folded napkin with her handwriting:



\*\*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre it. Let‚Äôs make this forever?‚Äù\*\*



Prateek stared, heart thumping. Then looked up to see her smirking, nervous, hopeful.



He didn‚Äôt even reply. He stood up, pulled her into the tightest hug, and whispered, ‚ÄúYes. A hundred times yes.‚Äù



The office buzzed with the news soon after. Teammates were thrilled. Slack was full of heart emojis and wedding GIFs. Even the founders joked about sponsoring the honeymoon.



Now, as they plan their wedding ‚Äî a cross between an intimate hilltop ceremony and a wild after-party ‚Äî they often laugh at how it all started.



Over a bug.  

And a meme.



Turns out, love doesn't always arrive with fireworks. Sometimes, it quietly logs in, shares a chai, and changes everything.

1jv165f,https://i.redd.it/1b0zihhowrte1.jpeg,I regret to inform you it costs a lot of money to get good bird pictures (Olympus 150-600mm review),"""You've just got to get closer!"" , ""Zoom with your feet!"", ""You just need to work on your technique!"". This is all a¬†***pack of lies.***

I've been shooting photos for two decades now, and until last year I never really bothered with wildlife. Sure, I'd see some photo of a wolf jumping a fence or a bird snatching a fish from a river and say ""oooohhh"", and then immediately forget it. It's boring, it's mostly documentary, and that $hit costs a fortune.

Well, middle-age comes for us all and I found myself knowing the names of birds and making time to look at sunsets and all the other soft-boy activities that appeal to a mind and body on the back half of life. The gray hairs in my sink spelled out ""long telephoto"" and I got into this nonsense.

I started off with a Panasonic G9 and the Olympus 40-150mm 2.8. Amazing lens, and a great camera if you don't particularly care about focusing. The Oly is basically flawless, and even though I rarely find use for it, it sits in my cabinet, unsold. I cannot bring myself to sell such a perfect thing. Problem is of course even with the 1.4x TC it is stuck at a paltry 210mm. Pathetic. I can throw a small child that far.

Oh look! Olympus (I will NEVER call them OM System as it's such a stupid name) released a new 100-400mm! I'm so excited to have that kind of range! Well, it¬†[was a dud](https://www.mu-43.com/threads/is-my-100-400mm-olympus-a-dog.122421/#post-1688501). As you can see in that thread, everything looked soft and gooey. It also feels like one of those camera lens shaped coffee mugs you buy off Amazon for $15. Cheap and plastic for a THOUSAND DOLLARS. Whatever, back to the rando eBay seller I got you from!

OK, if there is one name we can count on for quality glass it's LEICA. They would NEVER put their name on a series of deeply underwhelming lenses. Not our precious¬†*Ernst!*¬†Well, 3 copies later, I feel confident in saying the PL 100-400mm is an inconsistent little can of garbage. Sure, once in a while you will get a glorious image, but much more often it will misfocus or be blurry at 1/2000 sec somwhow or the IS will just kind of not work. And when you complain¬†**they**¬†will yell, in unison, ""you just got a bad copy"". Buddy, at this point I think you'd be better off buying $1k worth of scratch off tickets at 7/11 then buying this monstrosity.

The Panasonic 100-300mm ii is certainly a lens. It fits on a camera. It produces images which you are able to transfer to your computer. You cannot deny it's inherent ""existing"". I have never sold a lens so fast in my life.

Never got the Oly cheapo teles because their ""expensive"" one was deeply disappointing.

So, anyway, late one night I'm dealing with a bout of insomnia and hate-browsing Facebook marketplace when I see a listing for the oft-maligned Sigma/Olympus 150-600mm. To be clear, the 150-600mm defenders (which I am now one of) have let me know it is most certainly¬†***NOT***¬†just a re-badged FF Sigma and there are extra elements and it's got the sync IS and hey where are you going I haven't even broken out the AutoCAD plans to show you the spherical elem....

Anyway a large amount of $$$ later (with a free 95mm CPL!) I come home with this monstrosity and slap it on my OM-1.

I will not get into the ludicrous ergonomics of this thing. Everybody has talked to death about how it ""defeats the whole concept of M43"" and ""when extended it flips you over like a trebuchet"". They are not wrong. This lens makes absolutely no sense for M43. It is truly an abomination. On the OM-1 it looks like a Honda Civic with a Tomahawk missile glued to the hood. Gawdy. Absurd.¬†[Malformed.](https://imgur.com/3fN8mww)

It is impossible to hold with a single hand unless you want to snap your lens mount, and although I've learned to wrangle it handheld (the adjustable collar is nice!), it cries out for a monopod or tripod. I'm still young enough I will be dumb about this and mostly handhold while taking ibuprofen and gritting my teeth, but do not let¬†*your*¬†pride and vanity cause shoulder strain.

I am a very large man, so I cannot imagine how stupid this thing looks with one of you little people.

Once I recover from my embarrassment (and almost suffer a hernia when I trip), I am¬†***IMMEDIATELLY***¬†in awe. This lens is otherworldly.

We are in a very different league of glass here. This is rarified air. I've used some higher-end Sony lenses and a boatload of classic MF glass from Konica, Minolta, Leica, Contax, Nikkor, etc. This is right up there with the best I have ever used on any system.

Focusing is lightening quick, but I believe the OM-1 is the main driver there. The AF difference between the G9 and OM-1 is so vast I cannot believe they were both released in the same century.¬†

The sync IS is otherworldly. This is a¬†*1:1 crop of a¬†macro shot, handheld, at 600mm, wide-open, 1/80th of a second.*¬†Read that again. From that description, you should see a blurry¬†*idea*¬†of a photo. Instead you get¬†[this](https://imgur.com/7Wx5UZB).

I opened this review with a derisive bit about the advice you get every time you complain about a telephoto in any online venue. Somebody will come along and start going on about how it's all about technique and timing and patience and blah blah blah. I am here to tell you you can just buy the 150-600mm Sigma / Olympus / OM System (barf) lens and randomly point it at birds a great distance away and you will get pretty good photos

[3](https://imgur.com/Fb7OflK)

(last one is a 1:1 crop high-iso, but I like the 3 little birds and kept humming the song)

I don't particularly like wildlife photography. The vast majority of photos you see (even at high levels) are about as compelling as a Wikipedia article image. Turns out animals kind of do the same stuff. Yeah, that duck sure did land on the water. Welp, guess that buffalo is steaming in a field again. You get the idea. Also, I've always felt at its core it is mostly a measure of free time and money. That's why you see the gray haired dudes at nature preserves with a 100L backpack filled with $30,000 in gear on a Tuesday afternoon. This lens has done nothing but strengthen my feelings on this.

As far as ""technique""..... Can you hold your breath? Can you steady your arms? Do you know how birds tend to fly? Have you taken photos before and understand the basic concepts of composition and metering? Great. I'm now handing you a very cool diploma that says ""Wildlife Technique"". You get 2% off at BH Photo if you show it to them.¬†

It costs $2000, but if it was painted white and a little smaller it would be $5000 and they couldn't keep it in stock.

I don't particularly like wildlife photography. The vast majority of photos you see (even at high levels) are about as compelling as a Wikipedia article image. Turns out animals kind of do the same stuff. Yeah, that duck sure did land on the water. Welp, guess that buffalo is steaming in a field again. You get the idea. Also, I've always felt at its core it is mostly a measure of free time and money. That's why you see the gray haired dudes at nature preserves with a 100L backpack filled with $30,000 in gear on a Tuesday afternoon. This lens has done nothing but strengthen my feelings on this.

As far as ""technique""..... Can you hold your breath? Can you steady your arms? Do you know how birds tend to fly? Have you taken photos before and understand the basic concepts of composition and metering? Great. I'm now handing you a very cool diploma that says ""Wildlife Technique"".

I've been traveling extensively around Asia mostly solo for the past two years. I read about someone who started weekly coffee meetups just to meet people, and it really resonated with me. So I figured I'd try something similar in each city I visit.

So here‚Äôs the idea. I‚Äôll be doing casual, low-pressure 1 on 1 coffee meetups. I‚Äôd love to meet locals and hear about life in Seoul, but fellow travelers, expats, lost souls, or fellow coffee addicts are welcome too (as long as you're friendly).

We can talk about anything, but personally I am into: travel, gaming, anime, food, coffee (duh?), cultures and customs, AI and tech stuff. I used to be into kpop and kdramas but that was 20 years ago (BoA, Full House, anyone? :p).

If any of this sounds like your vibe, I‚Äôd love to meet you. I have a list of cafes saved on google maps, but open to visiting some of your favorites as well. I'm staying near Myeongdong, but open to traveling anywhere not too far or inconvenient to get to. 

DM me to coordinate.

Cheers!

Fun fact: Korea has one of the highest caf√© densities in the world. Seoul alone has over 18,000 cafes! So technically, I could do a coffee meetup here every day for 49 years and still not hit them all.",3,1744188521.0,seoul,0,1.0,False

This is all a¬†***pack of lies.***

I've been shooting photos for two decades now, and until last year I never really bothered with wildlife. Sure, I'd see some photo of a wolf jumping a fence or a bird snatching a fish from a river and say ""oooohhh"", and then immediately forget it. It's boring, it's mostly documentary, and that $hit costs a fortune.

Well, middle-age comes for us all and I found myself knowing the names of birds and making time to look at sunsets and all the other soft-boy activities that appeal to a mind and body on the back half of life. The gray hairs in my sink spelled out ""long telephoto"" and I got into this nonsense.

I started off with a Panasonic G9 and the Olympus 40-150mm 2.8. Amazing lens, and a great camera if you don't particularly care about focusing. The Oly is basically flawless, and even though I rarely find use for it, it sits in my cabinet, unsold. I cannot bring myself to sell such a perfect thing. Problem is of course even with the 1.4x TC it is stuck at a paltry 210mm. Pathetic. I can throw a small child that far.

Oh look! Olympus (I will NEVER call them OM System as it's such a stupid name) released a new 100-400mm! I'm so excited to have that kind of range! Well, it¬†[was a dud](https://www.mu-43.com/threads/is-my-100-400mm-olympus-a-dog.122421/#post-1688501). As you can see in that thread, everything looked soft and gooey. It also feels like one of those camera lens shaped coffee mugs you buy off Amazon for $15. Cheap and plastic for a THOUSAND DOLLARS. Whatever, back to the rando eBay seller I got you from!

OK, if there is one name we can count on for quality glass it's LEICA. They would NEVER put their name on a series of deeply underwhelming lenses. Not our precious¬†*Ernst!*¬†Well, 3 copies later, I feel confident in saying the PL 100-400mm is an inconsistent little can of garbage. Sure, once in a while you will get a glorious image, but much more often it will misfocus or be blurry at 1/2000 sec somwhow or the IS will just kind of not work. And when you complain¬†**they**¬†will yell, in unison, ""you just got a bad copy"". Buddy, at this point I think you'd be better off buying $1k worth of scratch off tickets at 7/11 then buying this monstrosity.

The Panasonic 100-300mm ii is certainly a lens. It fits on a camera. It produces images which you are able to transfer to your computer. You cannot deny it's inherent ""existing"". I have never sold a lens so fast in my life.

Never got the Oly cheapo teles because their ""expensive"" one was deeply disappointing.

So, anyway, late one night I'm dealing with a bout of insomnia and hate-browsing Facebook marketplace when I see a listing for the oft-maligned Sigma/Olympus 150-600mm. To be clear, the 150-600mm defenders (which I am now one of) have let me know it is most certainly¬†***NOT***¬†just a re-badged FF Sigma and there are extra elements and it's got the sync IS and hey where are you going I haven't even broken out the AutoCAD plans to show you the spherical elem....

Anyway a large amount of $$$ later (with a free 95mm CPL!) I come home with this monstrosity and slap it on my OM-1.

I will not get into the ludicrous ergonomics of this thing. Everybody has talked to death about how it ""defeats the whole concept of M43"" and ""when extended it flips you over like a trebuchet"". They are not wrong. This lens makes absolutely no sense for M43. It is truly an abomination. On the OM-1 it looks like a Honda Civic with a Tomahawk missile glued to the hood. Gawdy. Absurd. [Malformed.](https://imgur.com/3fN8mww)

It is impossible to hold with a single hand unless you want to snap your lens mount, and although I've learned to wrangle it handheld (the adjustable collar is nice!), it cries out for a monopod or tripod. I'm still young enough I will be dumb about this and mostly handhold while taking ibuprofen and gritting my teeth, but do not let¬†*your*¬†pride and vanity cause shoulder strain.

I got¬†*actual looks and comments*¬†from my neighbors while walking around with it. ""Hey #REDACTED#, you sure your lens is big enough?! Ha!"" was an actual thing the old lady who lives across the street¬†*yelled at me*¬†as I aimed at a bald eagle perched in a nearby tree. I am a very large man, so I cannot imagine how stupid this thing looks with one of you little people.

Once I recover from my embarrassment (and almost suffer a hernia when I trip), I am¬†***IMMEDIATELLY***¬†in awe. This lens is otherworldly. I am drooling like a moron while checking sharpness on my screen. Wide-open, at 600mm handheld I am getting untouched 1:1 crops like [this](https://imgur.com/ot8072w) and [this](https://imgur.com/fqNcDT6).

I hope your day is going well or that it will turn around soon if it isn't <3. My day has started out pretty well, though I did almost set fire to my breakfast this morning (again lol).

Anyways, I have a kinda silly request: I have an entire playlist full of objectively dumb songs that make me unreasonably happy when I put them on and they help break my executive dysfunction. I can listen to them even when I don't feel like listening to music, because it's not serious or deeply emotional music. The problem is, I don't want to listen this playlist to death, so I would love some song recommendations if you have any! The song should preferably be somewhat upbeat, and should be either just silly or ironic. Here's a link for your enjoyment should you dare to listen to the most questionable side of my musical taste (it's not for kids, read below to get a better idea of what the playlist is like): [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3pCRSd3aF0wCWn1Qsus2x4?si=aefa05e0a21940e6](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3pCRSd3aF0wCWn1Qsus2x4?si=aefa05e0a21940e6)

Edit: since spotify is currently down, here is the equivalent playlist on youtube music: [https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeJjuOqV1bK4yg9ebm1ldcM8TlsAsbF\_q&si=cdbei7BvgZiEStam](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeJjuOqV1bK4yg9ebm1ldcM8TlsAsbF_q&si=cdbei7BvgZiEStam) 

Examples from the playlist:

There are plenty of songs that sound very happy but are actually about s\*\*cide for example, like Bullet by Hollywood Undead, or The Family-Friendly Noose Song by Rusty Cage. Other songs are pretty vulgar but help shut up the busy bees in my head that try to ruin my self-worth or motivation, like stfu by Pink Guy, WTFIGO by Bo Burnham and Shit, also by Bo Burnham. Some songs are childish favorites from Smosh or Nigahiga, and some are just plain stupid and make me laugh, like I Glued My Balls To My Butthole Again by Obscurest Vinyl. Some songs are annoying (What I Want is a Proper Cup of Coffee by Trout Fishing in America). One or two are just... weird. The most questionable song is Allah's Plan by Go Hang Music. I added this song after watching a youtube short with the band members just playing the music casually, and the Spotify-version is nowhere near as good as in the short (I was expecting banjo-metal with an emphasis on the banjo, but got banjo-metal where the banjo is barely audible).

Anyways, I hope it brings others the same joy it brings me. Have a nice hump-day! :D

ETA:

Songs that are off limits:

\- The duck song, or anything in that realm like badgers badgers badgers or Narwhals swimming in the ocean (just please no).

\- Anything that is vulgar just for vulgarity's sake. I draw the line at Good Lookin' by Dixon Dallas (and only include that on the playlist because my friend loves it).

\- the Muffin Song by TomSka. This one.... is complicated for me. I do love ironic songs about depression and s\*\*cide, but this songs explicitly repeats the phrase ""I wanna die."" My past mental-health struggles involved certain passive ideations, and lets just say that this song unfortunately (and hilariously).... triggers me? I do recommend it to anyone who likes the playlist though. It's a great funny song, it's just not for me.",1,1744188239.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False

Asking for advice as I've been told I'm too sensitive in the past and would like some advice.

For background, when me and my partner met he said he showed his affection by cooking and looking after people. He's not the type to compliment a lot, but his 'acts of service' is how he shows he cares. 

We've been living together a few years now and I think I do my fair share around the house, but my partner does the majority of the cooking. He also makes the best coffee (think barista-style) and I love getting a coffee in the morning, and I thought he enjoyed making them. Whenever I try to make one it never turns out the same. It's quite nice to sit and take ten minutes sitting together with a coffee, it's kind of become a little ritual for us.

Anyway, I've been ill this week, and today I got out of bed super early to go snooze on the sofa instead of keeping my partner up. He came down eventually, almost 8am, he clearly had woken up on the wrong side of the bed (perhaps he hadn't slept well because of me being ill). He was in the kitchen and I asked if I could have a coffee, which he did, I said thank you. I asked him what was wrong and he said ""I just can't deal with your sick princess attitude at the moment"", and I burst into tears. I didn't think asking for a coffee was a big deal.

This is where I think I might be overly sensitive; I know he's been stressed with work, and if he's not slept well himself then he wasn't thinking. But this isn't the first time he's said something quite hurtful (he's told me recently that I'm also transactional with my affection, and also told me to go f\*ck myself). It always boils down to him being stressed and he apologises. He's already apologised for today but it's still eating me up. I want to be supportive but I also don't want to be the verbal punching bag either. Or do I just need to toughen up?

1jv0x2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1jv0x2z/how_do_friendship_norms_differ_across_cultures_my/,How do friendship norms differ across cultures? My time in Switzerland really surprised me.,"I‚Äôve been living in Switzerland for a few years now (originally from Latin America), and one thing that stood out early on was how¬†structured¬†and¬†formal¬†social life can feel. Want to grab coffee? You‚Äôll probably need to book it three weeks in advance. 

Back home, friendships often spark in minutes, sometimes after just one funny conversation. Here, it feels like social connection follows a much slower, more rule-based path.

So, is this a uniquely Swiss thing, or do other countries also approach friendships with this level of‚Ä¶ planning?

How are friendships usually formed where¬†*you*¬†live? Are spontaneous hangouts common? Do people show interest quickly, or does everything happen gradually? I‚Äôd love to hear how different cultures approach building connections, especially if you‚Äôve moved between countries, because this sometimes drives me crazy.",19,1744187680.0,expats,10,0.91,False

I first attributed it to my coffee drinking, but I get it too even when I don't drink coffee.

I'm usually productive because I'm in med school and I need to study for quizzes/do schoolwork, but I'm in post midterms exam phase and I'm just chillin and relaxing to compensate the stressful nights of studying for the exam.

But often in times like this, I kind of get withdrawal from ""working"", when I'm not doing anything, it feels wrong for me, like I'm supposed to be doing something but there's nothing to do, and I feel the anxiety of an upcoming deadline even when there's none. I distract myself with games but the feeling doesn't go away.

I need to really relax and stop, but it's hard because of my fast paced lifestyle. Any advice?

1jv0rrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1jv0rrb/hostile_coworker_should_i_report/,"Hostile coworker, should I report ?","Hey everyone,
I am currently in a dilemma and I could appreciate some advice.
There is this coworker who has been constantly hostile since I joined the company. She's always passive aggressive, making me uncomfortable by asking me inappropriate questions about my weight or my performance evaluation, etc... she is also always rude, I could literally just ask her stuff like : ""Have you seen this person around?"" And she would reply ""Go look for yourself, why don't you?"". I used to ignore these things because they seemed still small at the moment, but it started becoming very uncomfortable since we worked all as a team and she was part of it. It would escalate to her not informing me about important work stuff and always keeping me in the dark, excluding me from conversations, laughing whenever I spoke and then saying she just remembered a ""joke"", etc. 
Lately, I've been feeling bad due to a chronic illness and I almost fainted twice at work. She was an absolute bitch about it by saying things like: ""Heard you were sick? Just right before the audit, how convenient haha. Sorry, I meant how sad. Excuse my English."" 
She is always asking me if I feel bad/sick and you can see her smile so much whenever I feel bad and then makes comments like: ""oww too bad! Anyway gonna get my coffee hehe"" Management recently had a talk with me to evaluate my situation and see what can be done and they decided to change some of my tasks to accommodate me. When she heard the news, she just replied: ""The clock is ticking, make the most of it while it lasts."" And of course, she obviously implied that I am getting fired. Other behavior that she's been doing was creepily ask information about me from people and all departments to know what I am up to, which is very stalk-ey.
This behavior has been constant for months now and while I am leaving this team soon to switch to another kind of role, I still feel like this horrible person needs to face the consequences of her actions. She's been picking on me for no reason, and I am afraid I won't be the last one. 
Do you think this should be reported to my supervisor? Part of me wants to do it but another part tells me she might get away with it because I am indeed in a tough position due to my illness. Management has been understanding but they made it clear that they expect that I should do well in my new tasks because the load is less heavy.
