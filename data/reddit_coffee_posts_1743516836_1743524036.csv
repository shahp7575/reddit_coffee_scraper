1joz5zy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1joz5zy,Morels - tips on backyard attempt,"I know a lot of people with more time/money/knowledge/resources/anything than me have tried with maybe fair to middling success at most, but I also saw somewhere on the internet that maybe encouraging them to grow where they might already could work, and they liked old apple trees, and I have one.  And when I went to go get winecaps and then some oysters there's an experimental spore for sale on northspore so... yeah.  Here goes nuthin!  

I'm located in zone 5-6 northeast USA (central NY) and have an old apple tree + have planted a bunch of fruit trees (including more apple trees) - focus on backyard type orchard ""food forest"" type approach, no sprays etc.  

Pruning this old apple tree to reduce the height figured I'd try to lay the branches to make a bed on a cardboard sheet; trying to figure out what low effort stuff might be the best to add.  Ask for some free coffee grounds from coffee shops?  Spent grains from breweries?  Try to put some old leaves in there?  (don't have as much now but I do have some I threw into grow bags I could dump here instead of trying to tomatoes in...) Throw down a bag of ""brown cow"" manure or get a stick to occ poke the deer poop into here (I realize the poop is not sterile I am not up for doing more than a scooper stick I leave by the tree but can't say I've read that morels like poop much just wondering what yard waste would be ideal to add to the bed periodically)?  -- I did figure I'll be throwing in ash from a small fire pit as I get it but maybe that's better for later / to encourage fruiting rather than to establish the spore?  Welcome any thoughts but mostly open to ""one and done"" cheap/low effort suggestions.  

And yea I'm entirely new to  mushrooms - first I figured I'd try to make a winecap bed under my catalpas, then I had some extra logs and figured I'd add some oyster totems, and then the morels were on sale and figured why not.

I made myself breakfast this morning, and while carrying it to my room,  I slipped on a small set of steps (I didn't get hurt) and dropped my food and spilled my coffee. Despite being fine, I felt upset and overwhelmed and just started crying anyways. When I was young, this would happen every time I got hurt, which I found really embarrassing because it seemed like I just cried over everything. 

As an adult, I typically now react to these things way too non-chalant, and I absolutely hate crying in front of people and try to hide it. Today though, I just couldn't hold my emotions back and I felt like I did as a kid. Did anyone else have this experience as a kid? My mom is super understanding today, and she talked to me when I was a teen about being a ""highly sensitive person"" which later turned into me talking to her about autism (my dad is self-diagnosed now too!). But as a kid, I know she didn't understand why I would get so upset so often, or how to deal with it. A lot of ""use your words, not your tears"" which would result in even more crying because I didn't have words to express how I felt.

I'm in the early stages of opening a bar in Brooklyn and would love to tap into the wisdom of this community. The concept is called a cozy, hi-fi inspired neighborhood bar that blends craft cocktails, natural wines, and local beers with an immersive, yet conversational music experience. Think: a living room vibe, but with a world-class sound system and community at the core.

The inspiration comes from my family‚Äôs deep roots in Brooklyn‚Äôs bar scene, and I‚Äôm lucky enough to be in a position to self-fund the project. That said, while I bring years of experience in sales and marketing, I‚Äôm the first to admit I‚Äôve never *run* a bar myself. I‚Äôm not naive to the challenges‚Äîquite the opposite, which is why I‚Äôm here.

I‚Äôm looking for a few things:

1. **F&B Consultant Recommendations** ‚Äì Ideally someone who can help set up the operations, train staff, and work with me until I‚Äôm comfortable taking the reins.
2. **Advice from NYC Bar Owners** ‚Äì If you‚Äôve opened your own spot in NYC, I‚Äôd love to hear your biggest lessons learned. What would you do differently? What helped you succeed?
3. **Hands-On Experience** ‚Äì I‚Äôd be incredibly grateful for any opportunities to shadow or work short stints at existing bars to get a feel for the day-to-day. I‚Äôll roll up my sleeves and do whatever‚Äôs needed‚Äîthis is about learning the business from the ground up.

I checked my monthly food spending for March and I'm freaking out. The numbers I've given are for 2 people, my wife and I and I just can't get over it.

We live in Columbus, OH, and considering that my grocery bill also includes household items for cleaning and shampoo or whatnot let's make it be $180 less. so $956 - $180 = $776. Still seems like our monthly cost is crazy high! I checked and we've eaten at like a ""nice"" restaurant maybe 3 times this month. Where the bill was like $80 each time. Besides that, we eat Chick-fil-A and chipotle kind of meals. So like $12 per person per meal.. Is anybody having a similar situation? Are we eating out too much? I have the impression that we cook at least half our meals. Always breakfast at home (we buy coffee out sometimes but not very often at all) and then 1 out of the 2 big meals is cooked, the other is purchased. Maybe we even cook a little more, like 60% (due to leftovers).

I see my friends getting burnt out, getting fat since they dont have time to take care of themselves.  
I see their health getting worse. They dont have time for their partner or friends and family.  
They spend hours commuting and working... working...

I dont understand it...

I might be spoiled out of my mind but here is how I have decided to live my life.

Instead of living in the most expensive place I can afford. I bought an apartment in a smaller town (30k pop) close to my family. 3 rooms, costs around $500 a month. 10 min drive to family, 5 min drive to work.  
45min drive to a big city.

I Bought most affordable version of the latest Volvo model car. Instead of the SUV model. So I pay $300 a month for payment and insurance (+ around $80 in gas a month). ( I was in a car crash a year ago so I want it safe for me and my girl )

It doesn't seem like I need to eat vegetables or fruit? I have not eaten any in 10 years and i'm doing great? Bloodwork is perfect, no deficiencies and levels signaling health are in top 10%.  
So my food costs like $200 a month. ( i eat simple, mostly minced beef and potato, no spices, yes i'm an animal, my girl eats more regular shit)

I only have Spotify, phone, internet and basics like electricity as monthly bills.  
I dont really care about netflix etc

Working out at home daily is free

Since I live like this I can afford to pay for both me and my girlfriend. And I work only 20 hours a week...  
My hourly income is $25

For fun I started a company running a store. and I do some fun side projects like a youtube channel.  
I do oil paintings with my mom and I help my dad rebuild his farm buildings. (My hobbies pay for themselves and sometimes give a little extra)

I have so much time... I work from 10-2 every day, 4 hours in total.

I wake up by myself before my alarm every morning.  
I put on some C418 minecraft soundtrack while I enjoy some coffee in the morning sun (every morning).

My girlfriend has not had a job the past 8 years, but she wants to start working with flowers now after her education.

Yes my ""state"" retirement fund will be the lowest. ( But I save a personal one)  
I get to spend 40 more years doing what I love every single day? Never stressing

We still buy what we want  
And go on roadtrips in Europe

I visit my family 1-2 times a week, spend a lot of time with my mom and little sister ( she just had a baby)

We have a gaming room where we play games together.  
We rebuilt the living room to a home cinema where we watch anime and movies

Since we dont waste any money we have money left over every month

Why would I suddently take on big loans for house, car and start working 40 hours a week?

We plan on having kids and family in about 5 years.  
She will be working 20h a week and I 20h a week then too probably.  
And we will have plenty of money and plenty of time to raise our kids

So from what I understand, if you don't take any unnecessary expenses you can live freely?

I guess it depends on where you live?  
I guess you need to find a partner that shares the same values?

I guess some girls would be unattracted by the ""perceived low status"".  
But at the same time if they lived with me they wouldn't need to work unless they wanted to?

Please roast my worldview

Like what would happen if my girl left me and I started dating and told someone how I live? Would they think i'm crazy?

Only real problem now is my friends barely have any time and I have all the time

  
( I understand ambition could be a reason for working hard, but im thinking more about people working regular jobs. Not someone that is working on their own dream, I work on my dreams many hours every day but I just dont call it work, it doesnt feel like work and I never ""have"" to do it)",2,1743522642.0,infj,2,1.0,False

As I'm waiting for my bags my C&P doc office calls me and asks if I'm already in town. I state that I am, and they say that they will call me back, since I'm here but they were going to cancel because they are having issues with QTC, not giving them what they need.. sweet now my anxiety already thru the roof(have ptsd w/insomnia). They call me back 2 hours later and said, they will still do my appointment because I am here already but they don't want to(unprofessional much), and they got ahold of QTC.

Fast forward 10 hours.. I finally fell asleep around 1-130. My phone goes off at 3am, it's QTC.. and the guy tells me that they are canceling my appt because the doctor called in sick..

I asked him why he is calling me at 3am.. and he just said ""I know"", then I told him, ""look, I traveled 7 hours on a plane, took 3 days off work, and rented myself a car to go to this appointment.. what's going on?"" He said hold on he will see if they have a different provider, then put me on hold.. came back after a minute and said nope.. but maybe by the time you wake up for the day..

I'm pissed and stressed now. I didn't fall back asleep, just laid in bed angry. Ugh I just want to be back home with my kids.. 

Now I need to either show up to canceled appointment with unprofessional but we'll meaning c&p and see if they will still do it.. or don't go, and possibly get told i didn't show up.. want to report QTC.. so that's a call to the VA.. and I'll probably have to take another 3 days for a c&p as LWOP again in the future because my migraines keep my leave pool drained.

* 2 tsp baking powder üßÅ
* 1/2 tsp baking soda üßÇ
* 1/4 tsp salt üßÇ
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon üçÇ
* 1 cup granulated sugar üçö
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened üßà
* 1 large egg ü•ö
* 1 tsp vanilla extract üç¶
* 1 cup sour cream (or plain yogurt) ü•Ñ

*For the cinnamon-sugar swirl:*

* 1/4 cup granulated sugar üçö
* 2 tbsp ground cinnamon üçÇ

*For the streusel topping:*

* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour üåæ
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar üçö
* 1/4 cup packed brown sugar üçØ
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, cold and cut into small cubes üßà
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon üçÇ

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat the oven**: Preheat your oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round or square cake pan or line it with parchment paper.
2. **Make the cinnamon-sugar swirl**: In a small bowl, mix together 1/4 cup granulated sugar and 2 tablespoons cinnamon. Set aside.
3. **Prepare the streusel topping**: In another small bowl, combine 1/2 cup flour, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Add the cold cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to blend it into the flour mixture until it forms a crumbly texture. Set aside.
4. **Make the cake batter**: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and 1 tsp cinnamon. In another bowl, beat the softened butter and 1 cup sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and continue mixing until combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the sour cream, until just combined.
5. **Layer the cake**: Pour half of the batter into the prepared cake pan and spread it out evenly. Sprinkle half of the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the batter. Add the remaining batter on top, spreading it evenly, and then sprinkle the rest of the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the top.
6. **Add the streusel topping**: Sprinkle the prepared streusel topping evenly over the cake batter.
7. **Bake the cake**: Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The top should be golden brown and the cake should spring back when lightly pressed.
8. **Cool and serve**: Let the coffee cake cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack. Slice and enjoy warm or at room temperature with your favorite coffee or tea!

**Tip**: For an extra indulgent touch, drizzle the cake with a simple glaze made of powdered sugar and milk or top it with whipped cream.

This Amish Cinnamon Sugar Coffee Cake is moist, flavorful, and perfect for any time of day. The combination of cinnamon sugar and streusel topping makes it irresistibly delicious! Enjoy! üç©üç∞

1joyvo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1joyvo9/interactive_bingo_card_2025/,Interactive Bingo Card 2025,"Here is the updated version of my bingo card for 2025. As in previous years, it supports hard mode and creation of a visual card/darkmode visual card (based on¬†[u/CoffeeArchives](https://www.reddit.com/u/CoffeeArchives/)¬†design).

[u/happy\_book\_bee](https://www.reddit.com/user/happy_book_bee/)¬†feel free to link this in your resources.

It is built in Google Sheets. Unfortunately, if you copy or export it to Excel, several of the formulas will stop working, as they don't transfer over well.

Same as last year, you will be able to track up to 25 different cards at once using the same Book Log. Instructions are in the sheet, but basically, copying the existing Bingo Card tab, renaming it, and refreshing the data using the checkbox on the instructions page will allow you to create multiple cards at once.

The cards will automatically warn you if you are trying to use the same book on multiple cards, even if it is only used once per card. It does not currently provide the same warning about authors.

There is still only one set of visual cards. To switch which tracking card is displayed visually, there is a dropdown just below the Gandalf Snoo on each card.

**New this year:** I've added the ability to track re-reads on the book log. Checking the box in column AF will mark the book as a re-read. It will color as a conflict if multiple re-reads are used on the same card.

**New this year:** If you do not put a link in the Book Cover column, the sheet will attempt to find one via Goodreads search automatically. If you don't like what it finds, simply put a link in the column as usual. A word of caution, however: The goodreads search is kind of terrible at finding the correct cover at times.

**New this year:** Useful for people who are tracking multiple cards, I've added a feature where if you add a color to the Bingo Card tab (at the bottom), it will color books that are used on that card in the Book Log. If the book is used on multiple cards, it will use the conflict color.

**New this year:** In addition, inspired by a long-standing request from one of my friends, I've added the option for you to customize what colors are used to indicate normal mode, hard mode, and conflicts on the Bingo Card tabs. On the ""How to Use"" tab, simply change the background color of the appropriate cell(s) and then run the scripts as indicated. I've added a Bingo Scripts menu option for those of you who use the card on a computer or otherwise have the appropriate UI. The checkbox still works as well, if you prefer that option.

Let me know if you run into problems or if something doesn't seem to be working right/how you expect it to. As always, please let me know if you have questions or suggestions for improvement.

To play around with the card, go here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CVrR3uHLLRTcA1vaDsQPkg44b2ujc8zeFdQVSTr0lkc/](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CVrR3uHLLRTcA1vaDsQPkg44b2ujc8zeFdQVSTr0lkc/)

Or download your own copy here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XPIp2nIELDSbFYEsPz\_xXJw\_BriXHB4uqiQUwJfC8qU/copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XPIp2nIELDSbFYEsPz_xXJw_BriXHB4uqiQUwJfC8qU/copy)

When you make a copy of the sheet, it will warn you that an Apps Script file will be copied along with it. Feel free to take a look if you are wary, but they are a few small scripts that track the creation of new Bingo Cards and enable that functionality as well as enable the new coloring features.",22,1743522431.0,Fantasy,6,1.0,False
1joyuvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1joyuvg/heres_why_ill_never_sleep_on_a_plane_again/,Here's Why I‚Äôll Never Sleep on a Plane Again,"This all happened a year ago when I ran into this guy while waiting for my plane at the airport lounge. No one would believe me even if I told them why I would never sleep on the plane. I intended to keep this a secret to keep my job. But I need an outlet, or I will be crazy... so here it goes...

""Aerophobia, the fear of flying, is an instinct encoded in an almond-shaped cluster of neurons in our human being's lizard part of the brain. It screams the consequences that may occur when we take our bodies off the ground, all from our ancestors' memories that are deeply engraved in our blood and bones.""

The above lengthy statement summarized the lecture the stranger I met in the airline lounge had been giving me.

I sighed, loud and intentional, while swirling my half-glass of merlot and checking the airline app on my phone. My plane was still only halfway en route from a major Midwestern city to my terminal in a Southern coastal city. Thanks to the ripple effects of previous flight cancellations since this morning, my departure time had been delayed for more than three hours. I thought I could pass the time in the lounge easily, but now I have to listen to this guy's unsolicited, endless podcast-style speech, all because I was too polite to say no when he asked if the bar stool next to me was empty.

Frustrated, I finished the rest of the wine in one big gulp, and the stranger beside me said, ""So, do you agree?""

Shit, I almost forgot he was still talking. ""Uh, sorry. I wasn't paying attention."" Out of courtesy (Damn the manner my parents taught me!), I followed up, ""What were you saying?""

""Our feet have their purpose - to support us to walk on the solid ground. They also link our body and soul with nature. When we fly, it's like we are cutting our connections with our core in the earth. It's unnatural for the human body to be in the air for that long. Doesn't that scare you?""

I laid my phone on the table and looked at the stranger closely for the first time. This man was in his forties or fifties, Caucasian, and thin-built, but with a big beer belly sticking out under his chin. His long pepper hair was tied back to cover the balding spots on top of his head, and his face was tanned and flakey. He was sporting a set of brown checked suits with the same wrinkle level as his face.

I assumed he was a salesman trying to strike up conversations and build networks with potential clients in the airport lounge. After all, this is a great place to meet many potential customers if you have the thick skin to bother people who are exhausted and busy minding their business. I am also a sales representative for a company that sells AI solutions as a service. I fly out of my city every week to different locations, which gets mentally and physically draining. That was why I lowered my guard and gave this guy some attention, not to discourage his hustle. But this conversation was taking a weird turn. I surely didn't want to entertain him anymore.

""I never thought about it this way, "" I said, pulling my laptop from my purse. ""Alright, nice talk. I've got to get some work done before boarding."" This was my best firm yet polite hint that I was done talking to him.

""Busy, busy, busy, I understand. I used to be on the road a lot for the M&A work, too. until I found my enlightenment."" The man smiled but didn't seem able to take my hint.

I hummed once as the answer. My eyes were still glued to the laptop and my fifty unread emails. I couldn't stop wondering why this man was at the airport if he hated flying that much.

The stranger sipped his beer, looked at travelers passing us, and said, ""Ok missy, I appreciate you listening to my rant. How about I get you another glass of red and get out of your hair?""

Before I could protest, he's already turned and asked the bartender, ""Can you get her another glass of what she was having?"" He pointed at my glass and pulled a dollar bill from his beat-up wallet. ""Here's the tip.""

I know that bartender's probably laughing inside. In this economy? What could a dollar get you?

The cold and blood-red liquid was quickly presented next to my laptop. I whispered thanks as the man finally left his seat as promised. I let out another long sigh and stayed focused on my screen to beautify the PowerPoint I had prepared for my pitch. Some time passed, and my phone vibrated. The airline sent a text message informing me that my flight had finally arrived, but the boarding gate was pushed further away from where I was. I growled, packed my things, and slipped off the stool.

""Ma'am? You forget your thing."" The bartender stopped me.

I turned around. The young man was holding a palm-sized white linen bag in the air.

""No, that's not mine.""

He frowned. ""The gentleman who left said to make sure you take it with you.""

""What? That's weird."" This strange offering took me aback. ""Can you just throw it away?""

""Um, I'm not sure if I could do that."" He put the bag down on the marbled counter. ""This looks like some organic matter in it."" He poked the bag, and I could hear the rustling sound coming out. ""If you don't mind..."" He lowered his voice, ""This is my first week at work. I'm not familiar with the rules. I'm not sure if disposal of this thing is allowed or not‚Ä¶ could you just‚Ä¶."" He looked at me with begging eyes, ""Take it and throw it away somewhere along the way to your gate?""

Out of politeness and sympathy for this green bartender, I reluctantly nodded, grabbed the bag, tossed it in my purse, and exited the lounge.

Boarding was fast enough. Thanks to two glasses of red wine I downed in the lounge, as soon as I sat in my comfortable business-class seat, I passed out like there was no tomorrow.

Suddenly, the violent shaking woke me up. I opened my eyes and just caught the elderly passenger beside me drop the hot coffee on his lap.

""Damn it's hot!"" He cursed.

Before I could offer him a tissue, the seat under me suddenly dropped abruptly and lifted up, and with a ""ding,"" the buckle-up sign was turned on.

The captain announced:"" Flight attendants, keep your seatbelts fastened.""

It's not a good sign when flight attendants must stop working and buckle up like the rest of us. I felt a pang of anxiety creeping up in my chest, but I brushed it off. Turbulence happens, I told myself; It's perfectly fine. We are like flying through jello‚Äîyou can shake the gelatin however you want, but the plane won't drop‚Äîthings are under professional control.

That's when I felt the plane start tilting downward. I opened the window blinds, witnessing the clouds rush past me at full speed. Soon, we were no longer passing clouds, and the green patches and gray lanes appeared outside the window. Panicky cries filled the plane.

""Holy shit, are we falling back to the earth?"" I said.

The old man beside me was still trying to dab his wet pants with his two square paper napkins, regardless of the fact that he was facing downward at a jarring degree like the rest of us. He turned to me, ""What? What are you saying? Isn't this normal?""

Before I could reply, a silver coffee kettle flew out of the kitchen. With a loud, muffled ""pang,"" it hit the man's head, knocking him unconscious, and his blood splashed all over my white, pressed shirt.

Passengers screamed behind me while more objects whooshed out of the front cabinet‚Äîthe feeling of losing gravity sent waves of nausea from my stomach to my throat. I held my best not to vomit or start wailing like my fellow neighbors. I started chanting all the prayers that I could conjure up, hoping this was just a dream.

The plane's nose tilted further, and we were sat vertically like in a roller coaster. One teenage boy screamed and slipped down the hallway and past me. I tried to grab him, but the force was too strong, and he rolled down too fast for me to react. I could only guess he happened not to have his buckle fastened tight enough. Temporarily safe in my seat, I was not in the most comfortable situation. My back was facing the direction of the sky at a 90-degree angle, my blood was floating all over my body but my head, and the tight belt on my belly was inching into my ribs, suffocating me, threatening to squeeze the air and wine from my body.

Crying, cursing, and praying echoed through the cabinet. Lights started flickering, and a pungent smell of coffee and piss filled the air. I still could not believe what I was experiencing. We were plunging directly back to the earth. My worst nightmare had come true, and I did not know it would be this soon, this real.

Another violent shake pushed me off the seatbelt, and my face hit the chair back in front of me hard. ""Ah!"" I whimpered, but I did not feel the pain as expected.

""Ma'am, ma'am, are you alright?""

I opened my eyes and saw the old man, who was supposed to be oozing blood unconsciously in his chair, looking at me with his blue, cloudy eyes filled with concern.

""I'm sorry?"" I sat up straight. Looked around. The plane was still flying - thank God - horizontally. No cries nor screams could be heard anymore. My heart pounded so fast that it could jump out of my throat. I rubbed my eyes; was that just a nightmare? No, it cannot be. The whole scenario was too realistic to be a dream.

""I didn't mean to bother you, but you were crying,"" my¬†neighbor passenger said.

After he said that, I sensed a trace of warm liquid on my face. I quickly wiped my tears off with the back of my hand, blushing out of embarrassment. ""No, yeah, sir, thank you for waking me up.""

He still looked at me with concerned eyes. ""You know, life is short. Don't let anything - work, school, or family - stress you out. Once you get to my age, you'll hardly remember what or why you were worrying about those things. They will work out eventually; God has his plan for you. All you have to do is believe.""

He must be thinking I'm another burned-out road warrior. I gave him a light smile and said, ""Thank you, I will surely remember that.""

After that episode, I could not go back to sleep anymore, so I stayed awake and reviewed my presentation for the tenth time. The rest of the flight was uneventful. After we landed, I turned off the airplane mode. I texted my boss that I'd landed and would send him the presentation soon after I got a better connection.

A news banner popped up on my phone screen as I was texting my message. The title reads: ""Breaking News: Horrific Plane Crash During Descending."" I opened the new window. The tragedy had happened only 2 hours ago, around the same time as I was having that bad dream in the middle of the air. This plane was taking off as usual, without interference from the weather or other planes. Still, the plane suddenly took a nose dive and crashed into the farmland nearby. Rescuing is ongoing, and no death or injury numbers have been officialized. But anyone could guess the results would be pretty bleak, given the wreckage footage the news is showing.

Why did this event seem similar to my nightmare a thousand miles away? As more emails came into my phone, I couldn't give the incident a second thought, so I went about my day.

\###

I killed it at the sales pitch, and the 3-day meetings flew by like a breeze.

Thursday afternoon was our time to fly home. My boss booked a similar 7 pm departure flight to his home city, so we shared the ride to the airport. In the car, we compared our notes on our wrapped-up meeting and agreed that we had a high chance of winning the contract.

On the bus shuttle to the airport, my boss checked his phone and said, ""You know that crazy plane crash that happened on Monday?""

I answered him in my most nonchalant tone: ""Yeah, I only read the title. Did they find any survivors?""

""No, it's so fucking sad. All of them, passengers and crew staff, were believed to be dead from the impact. Did you see the video?""

""I don't like to watch that stuff; they kept me awake at night,"" I said. ""Did they ever find out how the plane could fly straight to the ground?""

""Nah, they've just uncovered the black box and sent it to the capital, no details yet. Shit's crazy. My wife literally called me and asked me to cancel my flight and drive home after she read the news. I was like, it takes 7 hours without traffic to drive from the Midwest to the East Coast, and then what, does she want me to drive to all the places forever?""

""Right? Only if we could."" I laughed.

""It's much safer to fly than drive anyway. I told her this kind of thing doesn't happen daily, but you know, wife gotta be wife.""

""Let's just hope this doesn't happen again soon. Especially not for our flights.""

""It won't. You've got nothing to worry about,"" my boss said as the shuttle bus stopped. ""Well, here's my gate. ""He pulled up his carry-on. ""Let's regroup for our check-in meeting tomorrow.""

I nodded. ""You have a safe flight!""

He saluted back to me and hopped off the bus.

My flight home wasn't delayed, so I considered it a huge win. I didn't want to look at the work stuff for one more second on the flight, so I started reading the book I bought from the airport store's best-seller shelf. I was only about ten pages in, and my eyes started blurring. I put the book down on my chest and dozed off.

I was waking up from my own involuntary coughing. Immediately, I felt hot - flaming hot - all over my body. For a second, I was confused about why I couldn't see anything. Once my eyes adjusted to the light, I realized the flight cabinet was engulfed by thick smoke and fire. The open blaze was coming from the plane's rear end while passengers ran towards the exit door. Two men were already pulling the emergency exit door, but either door's red, bulky handle wouldn't barge, and the captain's inflight comm was fried. He spoke like rapid-fire, but his voice was distorted and drowned out by muffled statistics and white noises.

One more man stepped into the right end of the door and grabbed the door handle's tail, and one woman stepped on the door's ledge. With a few more pushes and pulls, a bright light cast into the smoke-filled space, and the door finally unclutched. The fresh air blew in, making the fire's tongue grow.

""We have to move now! Come with me!"" A flight attendant crouched next to me. Her curly black hair was spread all over her face. I looked at her hazel eyes glowing from the fire but couldn't recall seeing her when I boarded. She unbuckled my belt and lifted me, placed my belly on her shoulder, and walked towards the door. I was half amazed by her strength and half confused about how this was remotely possible. I looked down at my feet and gasped - when did I become so short that a petite lady could carry me like nothing?

The flight attendant halted as she moved down the hallway. A massive crowd was glued to the spot like a mountain blocking us from advancing further, and their movement to the exit was painfully slow. Every second was like a century passing in the inferno. Swears filled the air, mingling with desperate cries and shoves. Suddenly, ""BLAM!"" A thunderous explosion shattered the air, ripping me away from the flight attendant's grasp. The force slammed me onto the floor. ""No!"" I heard the flight attendant cry out. Instantly, another deafening ""BANG!"" filled the space, accompanied by the chaotic symphony of shattered glass and crackling crimson flames swirling around me. Then, darkness eroded my vision, erasing everything left to see.

""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Southern coastal city's International Airport. Local time is 11:25 pm‚Ä¶""

""What?"" I said, realizing my throat was burning.

""Welp, that must be a hell of a book. Put you to sleep through the whole way."" The man who sat next to me said.

I looked down at the book. It was that boring book about not giving a fuck about everything, ""For sure, it gets repetitive fast after the shocking openings.""

""This is home for ya?"" He stood up and helped me with my overhead carry-on.

""Yeah, you?""

""No, I was supposed to head to a city in Florida for my brother's bachelor party, but it looks like the plane coming in caught on fire after it landed."" He said, ""I may end up getting a voucher to stay in this place for a night. Do you have any late-night bite recommendations? I'm tired of going to those tourist trap places‚Ä¶""

My ears rang, my throat was dry like sandpaper, and I could no longer hear the men. A flight caught on fire, same as my dream again? Could this be another freaky coincidence? It's not like my dream manifested the whole thing, or I suddenly became a seer who can predict omens, right?

Realized the guy was still staring at me expectantly. I said, ""Sorry, I don't actually go out in town these days, so I'm coming up blank. A lot of good restaurants are probably closed by now. You can always hit up the famous party street for some late-night scenes."" Seeing his disappointed face, I added, ""I'm sure you can still get decent local sandwiches at one of those bars that open up late.""

""I appreciate it. Well, I'll have to find someone to help me sort out my flight schedule first and then get the food.

""If you don't mind,"" I said, ""Can you tell me your supposed incoming flight number?""

""Sure, let me see."" He pulled up the airline app on his phone. ""It was ABC### (I'm hiding the numbers for obvious reasons). So, are you heading home directly, or want to get a bite together?""

""No thanks. I'm absolutely beat. I hope you have a good time in this city, though.""

On my Uber home, I couldn't help but delve into the reports surrounding ABC###. The flight caught on fire shortly after taking off. The fire erupted from the plane's rear end, spreading too fast for flight attendants to put it off. The pilot made an emergency landing, but the emergency exit doors malfunctioned for no definite reason reported yet, which compounded the damage, and half of the flight passengers were killed from burning and smoke inhalation.

Among the passengers who lost their lives, the youngest victim was a 6-year-old girl. One of the brave flight attendants tried to carry the young girl toward the exit as her mom had succumbed to a lack of oxygen. However, during the process, one of the engines exploded, and the girl was hurled down the hallway and consumed by the blaze. The flight attendant who recounted the event suffered minor external injuries and was rushed to the nearest hospital along with other survivors for overnight observation. The news videos showed her profile picture - a young woman in her twenties with long, curly black hair and hazel eyes.

\###

""As I was saying, clients liked what they saw and wanted our team to fly in the following Monday to meet their CIO directly,"" my boss said.

I frowned.

""Oh, someone's not happy about flying again?"" My colleague said.

I cursed myself for forgetting the camera was on. ""No, it's just those flight incidents are getting really disturbing. ""

""Try to get some sleep this weekend,"" my boss said. ""But if you want to forgo the rest time for the party, you can always sleep on the flight.""

Sure, like I would ever dare to sleep during the flight again.

After the call, I started unpacking my luggage. While taking out my notebook from the backpack, a small bag slipped out. The damn bag of dirt that weird man left for me had been living in my bag for this whole time; I completely forgot to throw it away.

I picked up the bag and untied the rope around its opening. The bag only has specks of dirt inside. I poked the dirt with my index finger, and a warm pulse shot into my brain. ""What the hell?"" I dropped the bag on the ground. It didn't move a bit. The sensation was familiar, cozy, and welcoming, like returning to a safe space, Nana's country home, or a long-lost ancient motherland unveiled itself once more.

Could this be the culprit that sent me all those weird visions in my dream? What did that strange guy say he worked at again? I quickly jumped on LinkedIn and searched for a Merger and Acquisition law firm based in the Southern city; more than 12 million results came back on Google. I pulled my hair, knowing I had no slight clue about what that man's name was or if he was even still employed.

I went to the fridge and grabbed one can of hard seltzer. Taking in the surprisingly refreshing sip, I checked the label. It's a citrus flavor, and the label says, ""Enjoy the natural sweetness without added calories."" I returned to my laptop and typed in the keywords ""M&A lawyer, Nature, Aerophobia, Southern city,"" and a LinkedIn page came up as the first search.

""R. N., a former Mergers and Acquisitions lawyer with 30 years of experience in the industry, has recently exited the firm due to aerophobia. Embracing a new calling, R. has transitioned into serving as a spiritual leader, helping communities return to nature and find inner harmony."" His LinkedIn profile said.

I clicked the connect button next to his broad grin picture and waited about ten minutes. Still, no reply to the invitation was accepted. He probably couldn't answer me anyway, so I closed the laptop.

I was waiting in my terminal to board the plane to the Midwestern city again on Monday morning. My boss and colleague were chatting about Saturday's football game, and I checked the news about the flight incidents. Nothing traumatic happened during the weekend.

After boarding the plane, I was ready to pass out on the flight again when my phone vibrated, showing a new notification that R. had accepted my invitation. I checked the window. The flight was waiting to get into the take-off lane. I still had time, so I quickly messaged him, ""Hey R., do you remember me?""

""Yes."" He replied.

Oh, suddenly, he doesn't want to be talkative anymore. I replied, ""I wanted to ask you about the bag you left for me.""

After one second, I followed,"" Never mind. This is crazy. It's probably nothing.""

""The bag that ties you back to the ground? Yes, that's my gift for you."" R. typed back, ""I hope you carry it with you whenever you fly.""

""What do you mean? What would happen if I didn't take it with me?""

""Haven't you seen those punishments for running away from Mother Nature with your own eyes? Oh, I bet you did. That's why you come to me for an answer. Isn't it?"" I can see his smirk through the message asking for a punch.

Taking a deep breath, I quickly typed, ""Guy, spell it out. I have about 5 minutes to take off. I had some bothersome dreams that happened to be the same as the real flight incidents. Are you saying those are connected? What am I being punished for?""

""A real professional can connect the dots,"" he answered. ""I've told you, it's not natural for us to fly this high. Mother Earth's wrath has found you. But she is merciful. If you take the soil with you, you are keeping your connection. She'd just recast the condemned consequence for others.""

""Are you serious? So this jerk mother would kill other people to show me how bad it is for me to take the flights to do my work and earn a living? I didn't do anything to you. Why did you have to curse me with this voodoo shit?""

""You are still not awake. This is a blessing, not a curse!"" And beyond all things, he added a smiley face emoji at the end of the message.

My blood boiled. I couldn't tell if this guy's been dead serious or if he was at the last stage of a delusional rampage. The flight attendant came by and reminded me we were about to take off - that meant I needed to turn my phone to airplane mode.

I answered her, ""Of course,"" but lowered my head to the phone and typed, ""R., what will happen if I don't have that bag of dirt with me?"" I did not even bother opening the overhead cabinet and pulling my luggage out to search for the dirt, as I knew for sure I had not packed that bag with me for this flight. Waste management is probably already picking it up from my trash can and carrying it to the landfill. Dust to dust, ashes to ashes.

R. didn't reply immediately this time. I anxiously stared at the phone as the flight safety video played.

When the flight lifted off the air, my heart sank to the bottom of my stomach.

Three dots appeared on the message, showing he was typing.

""Do not ever sleep on the plane."" The message came through: ""Maybe that will work.""

""Maybe? What do you mean, maybe?!"" I typed back, but my phone lost the signal, and the message I sent stuck in the forever circle symbol.

I glanced at the passengers, who listened to the music, closed their eyes, tried to get some rest, or chatted with their companions. They were going through the routine like any other day on the plane.

R. never replied me again - the asshole blocked me after our last conversation.

This is why I never sleep on my flight anymore, no matter how long the trip is‚Äîa four-hour domestic flight, a ten-hour trip to Europe, or thirty-two hours of international flights to South Asia ‚Äîand I am so, so tired‚Ä¶

This is long and I already know there‚Äôs not much I can do but just wanted to share for opinions and thoughts. 

I‚Äôm 43 F and he is 54 M. We‚Äôve been (I thought) flirting a little over the past few weeks - eye contact, smiles, he seemed to make excuses to workout near me etc‚Ä¶we‚Äôd had a couple of chats which seemed positive and I was definitely feeling like there was a connection/attraction on both sides. I asked my old PT who used to train in a class with him and she told me she knew he has a son but that he‚Äôd never mentioned a partner, there‚Äôs no wedding ring etc.

Anyway on Sunday I decided to shoot my shot. I said hi to him and had a brief chat when I saw him then started my session. Then saw he was getting ready to leave the gym so I went after him and called him and just said I know this is a bit out of the blue but wondered if you wanted to go for coffee sometime. He sort of hesitated and smiled and looked like he didn‚Äôt know what to say‚Ä¶I got flustered and was like ‚Äúyou can say no, I don‚Äôt mind‚Äù - he then said ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶can‚Äôt really‚Äù üòï So I sort of looked a bit questioning, but he didn‚Äôt elaborate so I said ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok no worries‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd very much like to - but I‚Ä¶just can‚Äôt really‚Äù so I was just like ok well it was nice to see you and he said you too and smiled and we both just went our separate ways. 

To me, that response made it seem like he‚Äôs with someone but maybe doesn‚Äôt want to be?! His expressions really made me feel like he wanted to say more but couldn‚Äôt. I wish I‚Äôd just asked straight out if he‚Äôs married/with someone but I didn‚Äôt want to make it any more awkward.

Him: Okay, cool

Him: I gotta go now, bye

Me: Same

Me: Bye

(The reason I behaved like this was that I panicked when he said I made it awkward. But besides that, all I really needed was clarity; I needed him to tell me if it was a date or not.)

After this conversation, he never really brought it up again, except this one time when he was teasing me about not having time to hang out with certain people ‚Äì as in himself (notice how he addressed it as a hangout).

1joyjjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollapseOfRussia/comments/1joyjjo/the_state_duma_has_proposed_to_impose_a/,The State Duma has proposed to impose a childlessness tax on 30 million Russians,"

In Russia, an additional tax should be introduced for men aged 25 to 45 who do not have children, said Viktor Taranin, a former deputy and expert of the State Duma Committee on Agrarian Issues. According to his estimates, there are 30 million such citizens in the country and many of them have a ""good financial situation."" Taranin noted that the problem lies in their desire to ""live for themselves"" according to the principle of ""I don't owe anything to anyone."" ""They, then, ""we need diamonds, we need to go to Dubai,"" and then it will be a wasteland: no family and no future, and the family name will be forgotten, and the family. <‚Ä¶> If we have 30 million of them, I propose to solve the problem radically: introduce a tax on childlessness of about 20% of the salary,"" Taranin said at the Moscow Economic Forum (MEF).

In his opinion, the birth rate is also hampered by the availability of divorces. Taranin noted that today a marriage can be dissolved right ""in bed"" via ""Gosuslugi"". ""Someone didn't give someone tea or coffee. ""Let's get a divorce?"" ""Let's do it!"" And no one persuades anyone, no one says that they need to think about it. This availability, permissiveness, is what leads to our birth rate being so low,"" the speaker emphasized.

In addition, Taranin proposed extending the payment to women on maternity leave from one and a half years to three and creating institutions to accommodate unwanted children. ""Why don't we organize a 'Baby House'? A woman comes [for an abortion], and they tell her: 'Give birth to this child, we can take it away, but at some point in time you can take it for yourself.' I think this would play a good role in increasing the birth rate,"" Taranin said. From his point of view, another important component should be propaganda, which should be obliged to ""not show dancing,"" but happy families ""with many children.""

Initially, State Duma deputy Andrei Gurulev proposed to return the childlessness tax, which was in effect in the USSR from 1941 to 1990. His colleague Yevgeny Fyodorov supported the idea, speaking out in favor of increasing the income tax (NDFL, currently 13 and 15% depending on salary) for such Russians. The deputy noted that families with children should receive about 30-40 thousand rubles per child, so the NDFL for childless people should be increased in such a way that the budget would form the necessary amount for these payments.

After this, specialists from the Russian State Social University (RSSU) developed parameters for a childlessness tax. According to their idea, the measure should apply to women and men who have reached 25 and 23 years of age, respectively. In particular, they were offered to add 3% to the personal income tax, 5% to the inheritance tax, and 0.5% to the property tax.

In turn, the director of the Institute of Social and Economic Research of the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, Alexey Zubets, stated that the tax on childlessness should be 30-40 thousand rubles. According to him, this will increase the funding of the national demography project, which requires ""several tens of trillions of rubles a year."" Zubets proposed imposing a similar tax on families with one child and those who cannot have children for medical reasons.

(The reason I behaved like this was that I panicked when he said I made it awkward. But besides that, all I really needed was clarity; I needed him to tell me if it was a date or not.)

After this conversation, he never really brought it up again, except this one time when he was teasing me about not having time to hang out with certain people ‚Äì as in himself (notice how he addressed it as a hangout). But after exams, he hasn't talked about it at all, and I'm skeptical to bring it up.

About flirting ‚Äì I'm not very forward with my flirting; I only flirt back, and that too very subtly. But this one time, he was flirting, and I gave it back a little too forward instead of playing it safe. His response to it was, ""Feel like I low-key walked into a trap, too late now,"" which meant he didn't take it well.

Does he even like me? I'm so confused and done with these mixed signals.",1,1743521604.0,DatingInIndia,0,1.0,False

Ok, I've been at Hy-Vee for 3 years.  I use to love working here. Yet since December 2023 my hours have gone down from 25-30 sometimes 40 hours a week. Because of the Thanksgiving holiday of 2023. I understand cutting hours Because of slower months. Yet, my hours have been cut so much. I was hired as part-time Hy-Vee policy anything less than 40 hours a week is considered part-time.  But you can only work 40 hours a week if your a assistance manager,  manager.  Hmmmmm?
Yes, I worked some 40 hour weeks before and of Thanksgiving 2023. It is because I  was need.
I've asked so much for more hours. If I hear the manager say she says someone has called in, or someone hasn't showed. I ask if I can stay for a few more hours to help cover part of the next shift. Heck, I'm only working 5 hours. So why not ask to help out, be a TEAM member. 
Well, I would be told, we can't work you anymore hours because your on a set hours so that we can have you working Thanksgiving week an 2 weeks before. Ok, I get that.
Well, I ask when I'm going to get my hours back and I'm told end of October first week of Thanksgiving, this is in 2024. So I wait.. I ask in November 2024 when am I going get my hours back? You will next week I promise. That Promise was broken. 
I have informed them that I have herniated disc's, spinal stenosis in my bac and neck.That I can not lift more than 20#. Had my doctors send in for lite duty specifying why. Way before this I had a total right knee replacement. Had lite duty sent in from doctor. Hy-Vee,  Does Not Have An Lite Duty Policy!
I wrote a note to my manager if I could only work every 3rd weekend a month, another day during the week, and still do the cataring jobs. I also stated I've been working every weekend pretty much since I was hired. Also to keep at my position. PT meal preps, fry foods,etc... That I'd ike to have some family time on a weekend. 
Ever since December 2023 my hours have gone down from 20-25 to 15-20 to 10-15 to 5-10 and now just 5 hours a week. 
Well, they took me completely off of PT and catarings, and put me on washing dishes, dining room, rotisserie and trash, extra cleaning that needs to be done too. 
I'm ow down to 5 hours a week! I'm earning less than $250 a month!
I keep asking for more hours. I'm ignored, or they say we can not give you anymore hours. I've pretty much given up on asking anymore. I haven't shirked in my duties. I may be slower because of the amount of pain I'm in, but I've give 100% and more. I don't take breaks. The only time I have is when I'm in so much pain I cannot deal with it anymore. 
I've done so much for them especially in the kkitchen.ive only called in twice because I was really sick, I've never not shown up for work. I've not left early neither unless they ask me too.
When I ho to work and walk into the kitchen, I'm glared at, whispered behind, ignored, not talked to, unless I need to help customers at the register, coffee needs made, messes cleaned up. I'm mostly in the back washing dishes.  Cleaning up the major mess that the donut makers left behind. Even from the days I'm gone I'm having to clean up the weeks worth of messes. 
I got to work with a smile, I put my personal problems aside. I use to greet other workers hello. Not anymore because I'm ignored.

She asked me basic questions, how id deal with a difficult customer, or what i normally do at dunkin if someone made their drink wrong, in which i responded by basically telling her i‚Äôll apologize and remake it for them, tell them to have a good day.

she told me she has a couple interviews after me which i hope are no more than 5-7 üò≠üò≠

I'm not proud to admit that my experiences with her have led me to internalize an impulse of bias against women, but that's the truth of my experience and I think it's important to be honest in introspection. I want to up root and eliminate these kinds of biases before they grow too deep.

I studied sociology a bit back in school, and most of the isms come from either learned behavior (like your parents indoctrinating you to feel superior to one group or another) or from a bad experience with one or a couple people that we subconsciously assume applies to other people with the same characteristics. 

But that's expecting a pattern where there is none. 

Best way to contradict that second source for the isms is to embrace exchanges or experiences with people of said demographic, that are positive or even team oriented. 

Knowing this, I've tried to strike up conversations and friendships with women whenever possible, and it seems to be helping a lot. 

Just having honest, friendly, face-to-face conversations with some of the women I've met out and about has been really healing for me. 

I've gone on a couple hikes and walks with female friends, gotten coffee or lunch with others. Planning to dumpster dive with a couple others who are down for that.

Even if I'm not open to dating right now (no time, no emotional availability), I like going on dates or date-like hangouts once in a while. It's really important to me to have some healthy, friendly, positive contact with women, to contradict the spiraling narratives that pop up in my head when I think of the shit my ex has pulled and continues to pull. 

There's also a conscious element of interrupting those ruminations. When my ex does something that feels evil-hearted, I have to deliberately remind myself that she's NOT every woman. She's only one, with mental illnesses and atypical behaviors. She's therefore not the best, nor the worst, and probably not even the average woman. Just a random, individual sample and by no means representative. 



I think once my kids are all in school I might expand what I'm looking for a bit. But I don't really envision being fully available for a real romantic partner until my kids are well into their teens. And when that day comes I sure as hell don't want to be a woman-hater, so until the time where I'm available for dating I'm just trying to maintain a healthy perception of women in general. 

Any one going through similar thoughts? Any strategies that have worked for you? 

  
I'd like to hear.

1joyh56,https://v.redd.it/2z4zctbds8se1,Using a Flat Bottom Switch for my coffee today...,"... which was originally made for tea‚ú®

So so so I got roasted over at r/tea for using a [Hario CHA CHA Dripper Bouquet](https://global.hario.com/product/tea/teadripper/CDB.html) for my Genmaicha Matcha-Iri some months ago, so I thought I'd piss off some coffee purists by using a tea dripper for my coffee on April Fools‚Äô Day. üòÜ

Anyway, I'm using the [Hario Tea Dripper LARGO 35](https://global.hario.com/product/tea/teadripper/TDR-35.html) for my coffee today and let me give a quick rundown and some thoughts on using this brewer for coffee.

**Attempt 1**\
The LARGO 35 uses a metal filter which I usually don't use for coffee, so I removed it and used my Kalita 185 paper filter instead. The dripper is slightly bigger than the filter, so the filter sits with some space in the dripper.

I am using R!sk's Lanao del Sur with tasting notes of orange, plum, honey and nutmeg, ground on my Fellow Opus Grinder at 6x. Water is 94C, and I was supposed to do 4 pours every 30 seconds with the switch drawdown on the first 30 seconds buuuuuuut

The damn paper filter clogged the opening, so I lost track of the pours. So I just filled the brewer with water and removed the filter so that the brew can fall down properly. Final drawdown was at 3:47 lol

The brew was a bit too acidic for me, almost overwhelmingly so.

**Attempt 2**\
In the second attempt, I restored the metal filter and used the same beans, grind size, etc. I was able to do the 4 pours... but since the switch pops back up instead of staying down, I had to keep on immersing the coffee then releasing it every 30 seconds.

This brew had more body, not acidic at all. More enjoyable taste-wise. My only gripe is the coffee sludge at the bottom of the carafe, it was like I was drinking from a French Press. I suppose I should have adjusted the grind size since I was already using a metal filter, but I got too lazy to experiment again.

**Quick thoughts: Hario Switch vs Hario Largo 35**\
*Disclaimer: I'm no coffee or tea expert, I just like comparing coffee gears and teaware, so please read the following from the POV of someone trying to understand coffee/tea brewing.*

**the switching mechanism**\
One thing in common between both drippers is the switch contraption, but the mechanism somehow works differently. On the Switch, one push and the lever stays down, but on the Largo, it pops back up so you'll have to put weight on it for hybrid brewing. 

I think this is because in tea brewing, immersion is the usual method, and you just steep the leaves in x seconds and transfer the brewed tea into the fairness pitcher, so the Largo only needs to use the switch once for every steep. 

**metal filter vs paper filter**\
Tea brewing doesn't usually use paper filters as it will most likely block [tea fuzz](https://www.teavivre.com/info/whats-the-fuzz-on-tea-leaves.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqJ3FkTbmY2cXUgaf4xj0xcJ8sqN-ia4vekpsBewNRV8JXIzkFF) or tiny tea leaves and these are supposed to add flavor to the tea. As such, the Largo isn't designed with a paper filter in mind, unlike the Switch. 

**Conclusion**\
I thought I could use the Hario Largo 35 as a flat bottom switch dripper, but it's not designed for that, so I'll just have to buy a Lotos to convert my Hario Switch into a flat bottom dripper lol

And before you suggest it, nope, the Sworks, Pulsar and April Hybrid brewers are not available where I'm from, so the Lotos it is.

Anyway, that was a fun experiment. Will probably try the CHA CHA dripper bouquet for coffee sometime in the future ~~but I suppose I'll have to wait until the next April Fools‚Äô Day so that it's more acceptable for the coffee community? idk, there are strong opinions sometimes~~.

I tried using primo purified water, and also distilled water with third wave packets , and descale my fellow kettle. Even had my coffee shop grind some of fresh Ethiopian bag I bought today and it still not coming out right (just in case my grinder changed somehow)

Last month I completed a 30 day lion diet challenge (yes, beef, salt, and water only), and then I went off of it to enjoy some non-carnivore foods (primarly, guess what? Sugar and coffee!).

I have to say: Being off diet, while kind of fun at first, just brings back all of the extra shit that you think you miss during the diet but really, to me anyways, it just feels like drugs to some level.

I had GREAT energy and focus after about day 10 of lion. Not even a week or 2 after getting off it I feel anxious, like caffeine is a requirement again instead of something to enjoy, and yeah, my mind is thinking about sugar and sugar cravings instead of real life performance. 

I unintentionally gained like 6kg. I was fine with maybe 3kg max, but jfc, it's so easy to add fat back when I was running really lean while eating like 1kg of beef per day and that in itself was an effort.

I appreciate the sweet flavors, but really, it does blow. I miss the results I was getting around day 27. I do appreciate the freedom and ability to eat seafood again, but damn, it's so easy to get sucked back in. 

Not a fun time. Maybe just see this as a warning if you're thinking of going off. Just something extra you may have to handle. 

Also, I am someone diagnosed with ADHD and do appreciate the ""fun foods"", but actually by day 27ish I was able to be without my ADHD meds and still feel normal. 

I'm not saying it's not possible and has something to do with genetics, but it does feel like there is a black and white difference between being on and off carnviore / lion diet. 

I don't like this feeling and am thinking of going back Lion, or at least regular carnivore again for some amount of time, but it feels like it'd already be a hard thing to do... Not that that's a huge problem for me because the performance is worth it and I don't mind hard things but still, like my mentor kept telling me, slippery slope lmao.",1,1743521139.0,carnivorediet,1,1.0,False

It‚Äôs like a mini celebration to kickstart your day.

3. **2-Minute Mindful Breathing:** Yeah, everyone and their dog is talking about mindfulness, but seriously, try this. Sit quietly, close your eyes, and just breathe. Inhale for four counts, hold for four, exhale for four. Easy peasy. It‚Äôs grounding, and perfect for those ""Ah, I can do this"" vibes.

4. **Quick Intent Check:** Ask yourself, ""What's the one thing I must do today to make it awesome?"" Just one. It‚Äôs amazing how focusing on a *single* thing lifts up the rest of your day. Plus, crossing it off the list? üôå Instant win.

5. **Fast-Fire Gratitude:** Grab a sticky note, jot down three things you‚Äôre thankful for, and slap it somewhere visible. Setting a gratitude baseline is no joke‚Äîit kind of makes your day bulletproof against minor annoyances. 

Why does this work? I think it‚Äôs really about setting the tone for your day‚Äîlike giving your brain a VIP backstage pass to clarity and focus.

Now, I‚Äôm dying to know... What's your morning ritual? Does it top mine? Or maybe you‚Äôve got some tweaks to suggest? Share your thoughts!

Happy Tuesday! Also, Happy 1st of the month, So cash your checks and come up!

I love mornings like these, cold enough to enjoy a hot cup of tea or coffee, promise of light showers and occassional sunshine. I know San Diego is a sunshine city most of the year, but it's because of that that I enjoy these days even more.

I am still hopeful that we'll get enough rain for a super bloom, long shot I know but here's hoping.

It is Taco Tuesday! Which can only mean delicious tacos! Which means I am hitting up Oscars in Hillcrest for some of their butterfish tacos!

I'm pretty sure their Taco Tuesday special runs from 2-5pm today. No, I don't work for them nor am I sponsored by them in any way. I just really like their tacos and I think you will too if you try them. Feel free to recommend your favorite taco joint.

There's probably a lot more I can say about today and how great San Diego is but you already know all that stuff, right? You don't need some manic pixie dream boat to remind you how great this city is.

I wish anyone who bothered to read this a great day and an awesome week. Seriously, I don't know you, you dont know me but I really do wish you have a great day and week.

1joya4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1joya4a/etereo_riviera_maya_review/,Etereo Riviera Maya Review,"My boyfriend and I spent 3 nights at Etereo mid-February to celebrate my birthday. This was our first trip booked with u/alex_travels and we booked last November during the Black Friday sale. Overall, Etereo was relaxed, peaceful and the perfect getaway for us. We look forward to returning for a longer stay! 

 Service (10/10):The service at Etereo was incredibe! Roi was our Guia, and our point of contact for our stay. He checked in with us daily and was easy to communicate with via text. All of the staff were friendly and greeted us by name. There was a special welcoming ceremony and each day we had small gifts left in our room. Housekeeping operated in the background, never disturbing us yet taking great care to tidy and prepare the room each morning and evening.¬†

Property (10/10):
The drive from the main highway to Etereo sets the tone with lush landscaping and a natural beauty. The property is stunning and understated at the same time. It flows well, with the buildings blending seamlessly into the landscape. Natural stone buildings, reflection pools and lush landscaping all make it seem as through you‚Äôre floating throught the mangroves. It is a very peaceful property and easy to navigate.¬†

The beach was well appointed with cushioned lounge chairs, umbrellas and cabanas. There were plenty of chairs - we didn‚Äôt have to worry about being out early - and shade was abundant. Seaweed was cleaned up regularly and the sand was clean. The water was more like a lagoon in this area of the beach; I think this is due to erosion measures. Kayaks and paddleboards were available. We spent our days at the beach, but the pool was beautiful as well.¬†

We did not use the spa or fitness facilities. Next trip!

Room (10/10):
We booked an Ocean Studio with Plunge Pool, and were upgraded to an Ocean Studio with Sky Deck and Plunge Pool - thank you Alex! Our room was the only room on the top floor of Building Two and felt very private.¬†

We had two large balconies, one with loungers that were perfect for coffee and morning sun, and another with a fire pit, seating and a plunge pool. Surprisingly, by the afternoon the plunge pool was a comfortable temperature. We also had two iguanas that enjoyed sunning on the sky deck.

The interior was spacious and furnished with natural materials, lots of wood, stone and local textiles. There were floor to ceiling windows and sliding doors overlooking the ocean and the room was light filled during the day. In the evening, when housekeeping closed all the drapes, we felt like we were in a cozy cocoon. The bathroom flowed into the bedroom, but was concealed by carved wood walls. The large shower had a glass wall facing the ocean and the bathtub comfortably fit two.

Food & Beverage (10/10):
Our dining experience was exceptional! We had a light breakfast delivered to the room each morning. Lunch each day at El Changarro, the beach bar, did not disappoint! Strawberry margaritas were our drink of choice and we enjoyed fresh guacamole and tacos each day. On our first night, we had the chef‚Äôs tasting menu at Itzam. Our second night, we had sushi at Che Che and on the third night we returned to Itzam. The ingredients and flavors in every meal were incredibly fresh and we couldn‚Äôt have been happier with our choices.¬†

Our only snafu the entire trip was at dinner our first night. We had a 7:30 reservation, and they sat us inside at a table surrounded by four tables of families with young children. They quickly accommodated our request to move to the bar, where the bartenders were friendly, helpful in ordering and we enjoyed our conversations with them both nights.

I (20M) have been seeing this girl (20F) for around 3 weeks now. We both go to the same college, and are pretty busy with the semester wrapping up, so we‚Äôve only been on 2 dates. The first was my suggestion, we grabbed coffee and had a great conversation, at the end she told me she had a great time and suggested we get dinner the next time, which is what we did a couple days ago. 

Dinner also went great, and I think we‚Äôre both interested in continuing things. At the end of the date, she mentioned she was treated badly in her last relationship, this happened as we were leaving so we didn‚Äôt have much of a conversation about it. After the date she repeated what she said, saying she had a great time and wanted to see me soon, and that I hope I understand that she wants to take things slow. I told her I did and that I also take things slow so she should try not to worry too much about it. She messaged me yesterday saying she wants to focus on studying this week and that she would reach out to me next week, so chances are we won‚Äôt see each other until next weekend. 

This has given me some time to think, and has made me question what exactly she means by taking things slow. Besides the occasional compliment, we haven‚Äôt really done anything physical or in a romantic sense, we‚Äôve just been getting to know each other. I think up to now that‚Äôs ok, but I want her to know I am serious about continuing things with her and want to advance things. I think it doesn‚Äôt help that we‚Äôre both just nervous as hell and too have been too worried to try anything

I‚Äôm not saying I need to do everything in the book by the end of the next date, but I‚Äôm worried that she may lose interest if nothing progresses. Should I speak to her about this  and see what taking things slow means to her? Or should I just start being more affectionate and gauging her reaction? Thanks!

The Grizzlies have lost 7 of their last 10 games, friends ‚Äì and despite having the home advantage, their visitors are just on a much better trajectory. Golden State has won 7 of their last 10 outings and they come into this encounter far more rested than Memphis, who will be playing on the tail end of a back-to-back after battling it out with the Celtics just last night. I know I‚Äôve mentioned this plenty, but the Grizzlies have been pretty brutal since the All-Star break, and fading them has made me nothing but profit.

1joy5jr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reduction/comments/1joy5jr/15_weeks_post_op_experience/,1.5 weeks post op (experience),"Wowwwwww! It's been 1.5 weeks since I got my girls lifted and reduced and I feel incredible! There was a good bit of stress beforehand, I read a lot of posts and experiences from others and the range of experience scared me. I thought it might be helpful to share some of my thoughts about my experience and some tips that really helped with recovery! Here we go! (Background - I am 24 and I was a 36 DD/E and I think my final size will be a B/C. I asked to be slightly less than proportional and my surgeon told me this was a mild reduction with a lift - covered by OHIP).

My surgery was on the 20th, and I was a mess leading up to it, very anxious, very excited, and totally unsure of what to do with myself! I tried my best to focus on my job and enjoy the last few days with my old boobies. My boyfriend took lots of pictures and it was fun to buy a disposable camera and have a little ""goodbye"" photoshoot (11/10 recommend). That helped calm my nerves and made me even more excited. I will say - I did feel the need to take an Ativan the day before surgery - I called the hospital and chatted with a nurse to make sure it was okay, and when I got a go-ahead I took it around 3 pm the day before surgery just to help me rest and sleep well the night before. I think it was a good move for me because I was chill and I got a great nights rest.

The morning of surgery: My boyfriend and I left the house to arrive at the hospital around 10 am. I immediately got an IV with fluids and the nurse did a pre-op checklist about my history and whatnot. An hour or so before surgery the anesthesiologist also checked in and asked some questions. I was pretty anxious and my BP was high so the team cleared me for one more happy Ativan and I was good to go. The wait was the worst part - but I brought my crochet and headphones and worked on my project (possum scarf). Around 1pm the team said it was time to go! I asked if I could walk myself to the OR because in past experience I found being wheeled to the OR to be a bit scary. The team was awesome and after a kiss goodbye to my man, we walked to the OR and I got myself on the table. The room was bright and shiny and I remember all of the nurses being so kind and asking me lots of questions about my job and life. Then the anesthesiologist came in and I had an oxygen mask on and then they told me it was time for the sleepy medication.... and then I was out! I woke up to crackers and crisp ginger ale. I was then told that when I woke up the first time I was moving around a good bit (no memory of this) and I had some extreme bleeding on my right boob - I went right back into the OR and was reintubated and fixed up - all good to go! My boyfriend also brought balloons and new pink yarn for me and it was a highlight - I felt so special, I know it's a small thing, but it's the little things that make the experience. We went home around 8 pm and put on Moana 2 and my sister watched with us. I strategically planned to watch Moana 2 because I love animated movies and I knew that I was likely to forget it if we watched it the day of surgery.... this way I could rewatch it on post op day 4 and I had no memory of it (1 movie, 2 completely blissful experiences haha). I definitely recommend having a bundle of content to consume for post op (movies, shows (I watched Severance), books, Lego) 

Recovery so far - Things have been awesome. From day one post op I was walking around the block. I have to take it slow and pace myself, but I feel energized and good. My pain was well managed with Tylenol 3 (acetaminophen and codeine) - It brought my 6-7 pain down to a manageable 3. By day 3 I was off the heavy pain meds and did 1-2 days of occasional ibuprofen, and then nothing. Every once in a while I feel some sharp pain - but that's just the nerves doing their healing thing. Work-wise I took 2 weeks off, I felt like going back on day 7 after surgery, but I waited until day 10. I'm taking a week of half days just to pace myself but to be honest I feel like I am fully functional right now.

Alright, let's talk tips - 

(1) Pregnancy Pillow - this thing SAVED my life, I am a side sleeper and the only way I could get any rest is with this thing. I bought mine on amazon and it cradles the body so you don't roll over in the night. Its also perfect for probing yourself up to watch a movie or read. If you are having a reduction - I would 11/10 recommend picking on up (around $50-80).

(2) Good Content/Hobbies - I was bored as heck after surgery. I was off work but I joined some meetings just for some social time. I also watched a bunch of movies (Princess Diaries, Disney, Studio Ghibli) and TV. I also picked up the new Hunger Games book and that kept me occupied for a couple of days. I crocheted while I watched and that satisfied me completely. The other thing I got into was Lego... it's pricey but such a fun thing to do - just be careful not to reach for pieces (stand up, bend over, keep t rex arms and go from there). I built a crazy giraffe set and it is the perfect thing to take your mind off healing. I have to say I was happy as a clam with all my hobbies for the week.

(3) Support - this was a big one.... I think I feel that my recovery was so smooth because I had an awesome team. My man did everything for me and insisted on carrying everything for me - from my purse to laundry to dishes - I've done nothing! I stayed with my parents for the first week of recovery and that was inane for recovery - I worried about nothing which was such a privilege. My mom did all the cooking and washed my post-op bra for me. She also helped me take a shower after I got my drains out and washed and braided my hair for me. It was great to have a buddy to go for walks with :) It was really nice for everyone to take care of me. I felt really loved and I think that helps the psych with recovery. I felt very social after surgery and I took every opportunity to see people which really helped me stay positive.

(4) Getting Clean - I couldn't shower until I got my drains out which happened on day 3. I was pretty lucky and had mild drainage so depending on your situation they may stay longer/shorter (also - I thought drains were scary scary but they were no problem at all) To stay fresh I did my skincare every day and that felt AMAZING! Just washing my face and getting moisturized made me feel like a brand new person. Also.... get some wet wipes to stay fresh down south.... :)

brand-new  
(5) Constipation - Opioids make you constipated - manage this right from the start. I took Restoralax every day and had my regular coffee. I was backed up until day 4 but I was not uncomfortable. I was very happy to have things moving again. I recommend staying on top of this as it has the potential to be uncomfortable. In a similar vein, I also was popping Gravol to keep nausea at bay for 1-2 days and I felt perfect - no nausea.

  
Other random tips

\- drink LOTS of water, it helps with healing and constipation

\- rest as much as you need - I've been taking a 3-5 hour nap daily while I recover and going to bed early. Do what you feel your body needs.

\- walk as soon as you can, but take it easy - it's good for circulation

\- no reaching! I know this seems obvious but by day 3 I felt like I could reach for things.... don't! I have to hold myself back. Be ""annoying"", ask others to reach for things for you, open doors for you, etc. You might be surprised by what triggers the chest muscles (opening heavy doors, pushing shopping carts, reaching). Take it easy and respect the healing process!

\- no smoking - I'm not a nicotine girl, but I have read that this is detrimental to healing as it causes the vessels to constrict which limits blood flow. My surgeon told me that usually 3/4 of the vessels to the nipple are cut during surgery to move the nipple, you do not want to mess or risk this final vessel or you could risk it. I also avoided recreational MJ which is legal but I didn't want to risk it for the first couple of weeks. I was told edibles were okay when I was not taking opioids. 

\- shower when you can, it was really scary for my first shower but with help it was okay. I can shower independently now and I t rex my arms to wash my hair. Don't face the water in the shower, just let it run down your shoulders. On day 5/6 I lightly soap my hands and run them over the girls. That was okayed by my fab suregon. 

\- sensation - I feel full sensation in the girls, slightly reduced along the scar up the boob I guess but I still can feel the girls. Especially the nips - the nips are quite sensitive right now so the doc suggested I stuff by bra (fluff it) to help with everything feeling intense. Just a heads up!

\- patience - while I feel like I am back to myself I need to remember I am still in my healing journey. Take things slow, be kind to yourself. Seeing the girls for the first time was jarring but honestly not as bad as I thought. I had my mom there for support and that was really nice to have someone else encouraging me.

  
Overall I am so so so so so happy I did this for myself. I catch my reflection when drying off after a shower and think, wow, nice tits and then I remember, hey - those are my tits haha! I've never felt that in my entire life so that was very euphoric. I don't know if y'all feel this but I want to show everyone the new girls haha! I feel really lucky that my recovery has felt so good. I've already noticed a lack of upper back discomfort and my posture feels better too! I am so excited to try on all my clothes with my new girls :) I hope you are all doing well and that your journey (wherever you are in it) goes smoothly!

1joy5i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1joy5i7/looking_to_potentially_relocate_to_australia/,"Looking to potentially relocate to Australia, looking for some thoughts","I find myself in a strange position. With the social and political climate of the US, I'm not so sure I like this timeline. I understand every city and every country has its up and downs, and has a political left and right, but compared to how things are in the US, it just feels extreme and unreasonable here. 

I am 39 years old with 15 years in network engineering and a dab of cybersecurity as a government contractor in enterprise systems. I am married with no kids, in good health, no criminal record, and I possess a US clearance.  I don't say all this to brag, I just feel like I would be a positive contributor to society. 

It also seems like browsing various AUS subreddits, and their perspective cities, that the IT job market is in a poor state. At the same time, it seems like most of the people wanting in are junior or fresh out of college SWE's. Neither is the case for me and I'm hoping my experience will help me out here. I also understand the housing market is wild. However, after researching NZ, AUS, Ireland, and UK subs, this seems to be universal. 

So why Aus? I have a cousin who lives with and is married to an Aus citizen in Adelaide. I was fortunate enough to visit Adelaide and Melbourne for a couple days each, and I LOVED IT! I know, I know, vacationing isn't the same thing as living. But as someone who doesn't know any other language than English, Aus seemed like an easy choice. I am also a coffee fiend. 

What I am not sure of and looking to get some ideas about:

* I am not sure if it's better to pursue a visa that I could show to potential employers, or if it's better to have a potential employer sponsor a visa. 


* I own property in the US and have a substantial 401k. Let's say hypothetically I eventually reach PR status in Aus. Is it better to liquidate all assets and transfer over after reaching PR? Before? This may be a lawyer question. 


* Assuming I can actually land a job offer in more than one city, is one city better overall for someone who enjoys mild weather and boutique/local shop browsing? Does one city have better ISP availability / reliable internet? Which city has the best public transportation and least crime? My wife and I don't care too much about nightlife but going out dancing a couple times a year is something we do. 


* I have found tons of apartments for rent on real estate websites, but is it true that the rental price for these is negotiable? If so, does that mean most are privately owned? I've rented apartments most of my life in the US and the rent was never negotiable when they're listed by a company lol.

Anti-anxiety medicines, apart from blood glucose fluctuations,caused significant lethargy. So, I resorted to coffee as a way to cope with academics. 

Eventually, the need for the amount of caffeine grew higher and higher. It became an absolute thing to cope with low mood (because of life circumstances), lack of purpose, sense of defectiveness, not knowing who I am etc. This is just part of the package and I accept that my childhood developmental path wasn't okay. 

By 2022, I was drinking more than 12 grams of instant coffee along with brewed coffee once/twice a day. My behavior during that period was difficult for myself and my partner at that time. I felt agitated, stressed out (even after working out), cranky, and some weird issues with my body temperature (too warm for me even when others didn't feel it).

I got a job and repeated same things. Eventually, my anxiety got the best of me and I projected all the issues onto the job which I did like because I didn't have to think much like it is required in academics. I got nightmares. Alienation from surroundings, dissatisfaction, restlessness, and my own exhaustion with my life came to take the central place in my life.

I left the job and I was still sick with anxiety, angry outbursts, and whatnot. So far, I have reduced it to 3 grams per day and I am taking Armodafinil to help me alongside. Sometimes I take Ashwagandha or NAC or B Complex just for the sake of placebo effects. 

Now I just need to figure out how to eliminate this toxic substances out from my life because while initially it may look all promising, the changes and the kind of person you become haunts one eventually because you're always on the run. You run and run, and then when you encounter a barrier, you break down. So how does it all end up?

I am trying to find myself all over again and hopefully get employed soon. I hope that the remaining life, whatever it may be, just turns out for the better. 

I would ask your feedback on how to eliminate the remaining 3 grams of instant coffee. Should I halve it or should I substitute it with green tea? 

Presently I am experiencing restlessness and anxiety, and since I am not longer chasing dopamine thrills via coffee/food/phone, it gets to me. I hope I can survive this. Thank you everyone for sharing your journey because I recognise parts of myself in your journey.

Thoughts?,"I have worked in various retail stores for most of my adult life. I strongly prefer them to restaurants even though the pay can be inferior because, as much as I can fake it, I'm incredibly introverted. I enjoy most aspects of the work, from ordering and inventory to just regular old clerking. I have worked in corporate stores (books, clothes, bikes, coffee) and small local shops (plants, outdoor gear, bikes, and now pet supplies), and I have to say after approximately 24 years, finding the right local shop is the key to enjoying the job. I cannot fathom how people tolerate being treated in a corporate environment, as if they were a totally replaceable drone with no life, no interests, no dreams. My partner works corporate and appreciates the structure but doesn't get birthday bonuses on his paycheck. He pays for a (slightly) discounted healthcare plan, but doesn't have the freedom to arrange his store in a way that makes more sense for his regional needs. His customers are drawn to the comfortable sterility of ""every store must be the same"", meanwhile I'm forging strong bonds within my community (if you've ever struck a ""coffee for dog treats"" deal with your neighboring shop you know what I'm talking about).

My preference for a small local business is very very strong, but I'm curious about others who do enjoy and thrive in a corporate setting. What do you like about it that makes it superior, in your mind? Do you like set-in-stone procedure and policy? Do you like having the option for upward mobility?

If I would be into a company of coffee stuff I would copy his Idea selling a set adaptable to any moka pot, adapting it to the already existing valve in the bottom pot. Also, I don't know how, the pumping system should somehow be able to provide a pression you can control, maybe integrating a splitter at the Base of the valve to have a gauge showing the pression, where you can also connect a bluetooth pressure transducer. In this way moka pots can enter in the world of profiling coffee by pression, time and temperature. I own a cafelat robot, which I love, but I like also the taste profile of the moka and I think you could not achieve the result of  a moka like beverage as the water comes from the top, and with a course grind the water would pass too fast. By having the water coming from under the puck in the moka pot you can have a slow and consistent passage of it. Having the control not only for the water temperature but also for the pression, and being able to connecting something like this to any moka pot you like would unlock a new world I think.",2,1743520120.0,mokapot,2,0.75,False

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. I won‚Äôt bring any drama into your life. 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s tgats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here 

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don‚Äôt work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I‚Äôve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1joxsq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1joxsq8/can_my_emotions_be_so_powerful/,Can my emotions be so powerful?,"Good day to all! I have been struggling for a good part of my life with strong feelings (especially negative) but sometimes this goes to a whole new level leading me to pass out. I am a 35 years old female with an amazing life, yet still, I have no idea how to control or understand better why my beautiful brain that just wants to protect me, turns to this strategy. I am in good health condition, got checked up multiple times across the years and everything is fine from a physical point of view. Blood tests were good, other liquids and substances of the body with the values in check, EKG was fine, etc. Now, having that pointed out, I want to know whether is there anybody out there experiencing the same? Am I crazy or going to be? 

When I was 7 years old, I went with my mom to get my blood drawn for tests before getting enrolled in the 1st grade. I didn t look at my own hand but I looked at another girl getting stung in her finger for white cells test. We left and on the way back home I remembered that image of the blood rushing into the seringe and I told my mom I was not feeling good. Hearing faded, heart was rushing, vision got blurred and the next thing I remember was waking up with scared people around me, my mom included, on the hood of a car (she intentionally put me there so I don t lay on the ground) and some ladies rushing to splash my face and chest with water. I woke up and went on home, not thinking too much about the incident. Fear +1

The next time it happened, I was at the dentist for a tooth extraction. It took longer than I was comfortable with, I resisted until the dentist showed me the huge tooth in the palm of her hand full of blood. My blood. There it was again when my brain said: that is too much for me. I shut down. Fear +2

Few years later, I got a boil on my hand, wrapped it with baked onion (to help collect the puss faster). After like 3 days having this on my hand, I was with my aunt in the market and the shitty thing started to let the puss out. I was squeezing it, draining it, when... I passed out. Got back up, didn t think very much about it. But in the background... Fear +3

It happened again when I was in the bathtub, I think the water was a little bit too hot, I got up, told my mom I am feeling sick, and the next thing I know was that I woke up fully naked and wet, sitting on the toilet with my mom slapping my face and asking me to wake up. By the way, this time I liked it, because I was seeing myself in a huge field of yellow flowers, on a sunny day. Very idyllic picture I was not very happy to give up on, but there I was, back again, blaming the hot water or standing up too fast. 

Second time at the dentist, another tooth extraction.... you guessed! Another blackout! This time I know it was because of the previous traumatic experience. I just got the injection, I was waiting for the anesthesia to kick in, I relived the emotions and poof... gone was I for a few minutes or seconds...  Fear +4

On my first day as a bartender, in a small bar in my hometown, I was having 1 sip of coffee and a cigarette. At a certain moment I started to feel awkward and got from the high bar chairs to a normal chair. I closed my eyes and I was thinking, I am feeling good, I am not sick, I am not sick, I am not.... The next thing I know is that I woke up with a bunch of men around me (clients of the bar) that were scared and didn t know what to do. Later on, I was tying my hair into a pony tail and I felt it painful. I went in front of a mirror to look whether I cracked my skull or something. I realized that I fell from the chair, head first, on the tiled floor. Shame +3

The last time it happened was in august 2022 when I went to the gynecologist for a check up on my pregnancy. She drew me blood, and I felt it coming. But I was thinking... Ok. We will faint, but let them finish. And so it happened. After I felt the cotton tampon on the sting, I told my husband I was feeling bad and before finishing I blacked out again. Turns out the pregnancy was not viable and I had to abort because my child had no heartbeat at 10 weeks old. Fear +5, Shame +4, Guilt +9

And now the question or questions: Why do these blackouts happen and why of all protective mechanisms my brain chose this one? My life became very stressful because of this fear. I go to see dentist just when I am in excruciating pain, I have a terror when I need to get my blood drawn and I live constantly in this fear that it will happen again because I AM NOT ABLE TO CONTROL MY EMOTIONS. They get the best out of me in terms of avoidance of triggering situations. Before the abortion operation I got a benzodiazepine just not to freak out. Most of the situations that involve blackouts include blood or medical procedures. Now I struggle with flights, parties or people gatherings, treating my clients (I work as a professional pedicurist and, oh boy, sometimes I have to deal with blood...), being alone, having to do things alone, I stopped riding my horse because I don t want to land in a hospital, I am avoiding life and drown in videogames, cigarettes and coffee. In 3 days I get to fly to Thailand and the thought freaks me out, 10,5 hours on the plane and  then my husband going on a boat for a week for a diving safari tour. And I?... Alone with my thoughts and fears.... What if I am alone when I pass out? What if I don t come back and there is nobody there to slap me in the face until I wake up? I am very angry at myself for these reactions. Rationally, I think they are there for me, they will pass, I will just sit with them, I name them, I praise them, I thank them and fucking try to understand them, yet still, I sometimes feel powerless in front of them and I let my body do the restart of the system. But with each fainting, the feeling of fear, guilt, shame and anger grows and roars back into my face like a bloodthirsty dragon which most of the time ends up swallowing me. Is there anyone else having these thoughts or feelings?

1joxq5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1joxq5d/mf_the_duel/,[MF] The Duel,"It was a quarter past three when the shadow interrupted the Sun‚Äôs rest, basking lazily over the saloon. The man, whose spurs could be heard two streets away, said nothing‚Äîhe simply stood there. His long black hair was almost completely hidden beneath a brown hat that crowned his head like a king‚Äôs crown.

Silence suffocated the town, swallowing the breaths of the gathered townspeople who came to witness the event. Today was the big day‚Äînot a celebration, not a fair, but a funeral. Whose? They would soon find out.

Not ten minutes had passed when a second shadow stopped in front of the saloon‚Äîa lanky red-haired boy, cleaning his revolver as he walked toward the circle of people that had formed. The man in the hat said nothing. His eyes, as dark as his boots, reflected only his opponent. No emotion behind them, just a goal. A mission. If someone was going to fall today, it wouldn‚Äôt be him.

The redhead holstered his gun and looked down, his gaze as intense as his fiery hair. He smiled‚Äîhe said nothing either. He preferred to let the whispers of the people speak for him. *His* people. After years of protecting them from men like the stranger, today, they stood behind him.

The Sun, now restless from the brewing storm outside the saloon, began to shine on the redhead‚Äôs badge‚Äîas if sending a message to the stranger. But the stranger remained unmoved. There wasn‚Äôt a trace of doubt in him. He felt the grip of his revolver in his hand, calculated the redhead‚Äôs height, saw it as an advantage he‚Äôd have to counter in milliseconds, aiming for a fatal point.

The Sun slowly shifted behind the stranger as the town priest arrived at the scene. With a rosary in hand, he began to pray for both men, who were moments away from leaving their humanity behind in the few seconds the duel would last.

While the priest sang his blessings, a beautiful woman‚Äîher soft skin the color of the coffee her husband, the redhead, drank every morning‚Äîran toward the noise. Between sobs and screams, she begged her husband not to do it, to think of what he‚Äôd be leaving behind. It took three men to hold her back.

The redhead gave her a single look‚Äîthe same look he gave her the day they met, the day they married, the day their daughter first cried. He loved her, and he believed everything would be fine. She collapsed to her knees, crying, praying for God to protect the redhead.

On the other side, a tall blond man in a black suit whispered something into the stranger‚Äôs ear. His brother‚Äînot by blood, but by bond‚Äîwould risk his life for him. All he could say was how sorry he was that things had come to this. The stranger only nodded, still confident.

Thirty minutes had passed since the stranger‚Äôs spurs broke the silence of what had been a peaceful morning in town. Both men‚Äîlike statues‚Äîstood unmovable, preparing for the final dance.

**One second**‚Äîboth men locked eyes. Neither wanted to meet Death; walking with her would be the other‚Äôs task.  
**Two seconds**‚Äîthe church bells added their toll to the spectacle the entire town now watched.  
**Three seconds**‚Äîthe silence, held tight for half an hour, began to break. People whispered, placing bets on who would remain standing.  
**Four seconds**‚Äîthe stranger breathed in, and the redhead looked to the sky.  
**Five seconds**‚Äîthey were ready. Their eyes saw nothing but each other. Not the saloon, not the people, not the redhead‚Äôs wife or the stranger‚Äôs brother. In that moment, only they existed‚Äî  
And the bartender yelling: **‚ÄúDraw!‚Äù**

Both men, transformed into the biblical beasts the priest preached about on Sundays, into the demons that lived inside every man, aimed straight at the other‚Äôs heart. They would be the dagger that ended the life of their enemy. Like Cain and Abel‚Äîbrother against brother, man against man.

The stranger pulled his trigger just as the redhead‚Äôs bullet was already leaving the barrel. Height isn‚Äôt enough of an advantage if the other is faster. But just before the bullet hit the stranger‚Äôs white shirt, he had enough time for his own shot to fire.

Only two shots were heard.  
The crowd‚Äôs murmuring turned to silence as both men fell.

The pool of blood from their bodies stained the clothes of the woman and the brother‚Äîone weeping for her loss, the other blaming himself.

There was no victor today.

First date we were supposed to go out for coffee and it turned into us spending six hours together - walking around, talking, grabbing a drink. We were going to wait until the next weekend but we ended up going out the next day. Again, hours and hours together. The chemistry is incredible. The conversation is great. We don't have a lot in common but we seem to balance one another? In a way?

It's early. Normally I choose to wait until taking the next step and sleeping with them. He knew of this preference. He said he respected it. He also knew I had very few previous partners. However, we had sex on the second date. I can't complain. It was incredible. He seemed to like it. We cuddled after. Went for coffee, too. He said he really liked me. 

However, he also said he was sorry that it happened that way rather than us waiting like I had said I wanted to. I told him I don't regret any of it. 

We're still talking (he's not a great texter, but expressed yesterday that he misses me and wants to see me again) and have two other dates already scheduled. He hasn't canceled (yet). He's lovely. 

However, I am so anxious now. I don't know what to expect. I half expected him to cancel or at least not be as emotional/close/cuddly after sex (if that was all he wanted). I thought he would withdraw a bit and maybe stop with the I like yous, etc. And he hadn't. But I feel like I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop. For him to run, I guess.

I'm scared I'm gonna make him run by being clingy or needy for reassurance. So I'm keeping my mouth shut and acting as though I'm not overthinking all of this. I'm just gonna text to confirm the date and that will be it. Only once he's off work. 

I guess... is there a way of knowing whether you've passed the test or if now the guy is just dreading your presence/done with you? 

This is written in a very panicky moment and I recognize I'm being unhinged about this. I do have therapy tomorrow. It's a constant progress type deal. ",4,1743519279.0,RedPillWomen,5,0.75,False

1joxip1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1joxip1/alkalinity_and_candida/,Alkalinity and Candida,"I followed a guy named Dr Sebi and started doing alkaline diet things here and there.

I switched my water to 9.5 PH only, with minerals.

I was healthy or so I thought. I wanted to start adding some herbal teas into my diet to become super healthy.

The first one I did was Stinging Nettle Tea. I started having strange symptoms immediately. Mainly a heart that was beating differently, like it was being effected electrically to beat up tempo or something. Not that noticeable but it continued the more I drank. I attributed it to something stress.

I kept drinking nettle tea for 7 days and was ignoring all guidelines: using tablespoons instead of teaspoons having multiple cups a day.

Suddenly, I was stuck with a major problem. I puked up my dinner, and was struck with something terrible. Fast, strange beating heart. Hardcore insomnia for 8 days. Feeling of watching reality through a movie.

I stopped the tea, went to urgent care/ ER, started hydrating again. Started to feel recovered. Was eating normal.

Then I had a coffee.

I basically went into anaphylaxis. Look it up.

From that coffee, I have not recovered. My guts feel irritated, inflamed, or infected. My heart beats erratic. I get fight or flight and a massively elevated startle reflex. I suddenly cannot tolerate histamines. I go into anaphylaxis state (or similar) with histamine.

I have to take famotidine and Zyrtec to block H1+H2 and that helps, but does not fix it if I ingest histamine. I react through it though the volume is turned down.

My functional doctor believes my high PH and Nettle combination creates the conditions for a massive explosion and overgrowth of candida in my gut.

The candida has disrupted my ability to process food, created leaky gut conditions and pure unbroken down particles are getting into my blood stream.

I can only tolerate a small stock of food. Peeled red potatoes, celery, carrots, rice noodles, salt , butter, extra virgin olive oil. And nothing else.

I react violently to citrus acid, meat, artificial flavor.

Getting a full microbiome test done to see what‚Äôs going on the gut which remains inflamed, irritable, uncomfortable.

**Part I: The Anchor**

Lex first noticed something was off during a storm. Not the kind that makes headlines‚Äîjust one of those summer tempests that darken the sky too early and rattle the windows a little too hard. She was in the kitchen, waiting for water to boil, when the air changed. Not in temperature, but in feeling. Like the moment before a d√©j√† vu.

It began with a dream‚Äîclearer than any she'd had in years. She was standing at the edge of an ocean that didn‚Äôt move, so flat and dark it reflected the sky like polished obsidian. Across the water stood someone. A figure, tall and still, just far enough away that the details of his face were blurred by distance, like looking through heat. But she knew him. Not from memory, not exactly. From something deeper. A bone-level recognition that tightened her chest.

https://preview.redd.it/6gi00hlmh8se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9611ca01493a54abefca9a2b1cbad4f00e1fbfb

He didn‚Äôt speak, just watched her. Steady. Waiting.

The feeling stayed with her long after she woke, clinging to the edges of her thoughts like the lingering taste of a word she couldn‚Äôt quite recall.

Lex woke with an odd sensation in her chest, like a quiet pressure just beneath her sternum. The apartment looked the same‚Äîmorning light cutting across her hardwood floors‚Äîbut something felt... off. Subtly tilted. As if the world had shifted by a degree while she slept.

This wasn't new. After certain dreams‚Äîespecially the vivid ones‚Äîthe world often felt wrong in a specific, lingering way. Sometimes the feeling would stick with her the entire day, as if she hadn‚Äôt fully returned. It was disorienting, but familiar. Just another strange part of being human. And dreaming.

https://preview.redd.it/148relfoh8se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca60372da443870ad12de9457471941147f6e4aa

That day, time moved strangely. Her coffee tasted off. Every sound in her apartment seemed slightly too loud or too soft, like the volume had been tampered with. She caught herself pausing at doorways, forgetting what she was doing. Something had shifted, and it wasn‚Äôt just in her head‚Äîit was in the air.

Lex had once been a seeker. In her teens, she‚Äôd plunged into meditation, lucid dreaming, consciousness studies‚Äîdevouring books on quantum physics and Eastern mysticism with equal hunger. Her notebooks had been filled with sketches of symbols, annotated dream fragments, and sprawling maps of theories connecting everything from chakras to Planck time.

But at seventeen, life hit harder. Drinking began. She partied. Wandered. Backpacking through Europe with no itinerary and barely any money. Yet somehow, she was always okay. Her friends teased her for having a guardian angel. She laughed along, but deep down, she believed in it. She used to call it her ""inner mom""‚Äîa voice that always kicked in, even when she was too far gone to think clearly. It got her home. It kept her safe.

Maybe that voice was him. Maybe he‚Äôd always been there.

She still had the tattoo. A small feather etched into the nape of her neck‚Äîdelicate, but unmistakable. She used to say she got it because it was beautiful, and she‚Äôd always believe that. But that wasn‚Äôt the full truth. Back then, she‚Äôd told herself it was risky to get a meaningful tattoo, because meanings change and values shift. But now, thinking back, that reasoning didn‚Äôt hold up. Meaning usually deepens. It‚Äôs the physical that fades.

https://preview.redd.it/uv1efyhqh8se1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d5514d33d931ebee66ec40e9f01c9d7ffa84cd6

So why had she believed it so confidently?

It was like someone had whispered the idea into her‚Äîfully formed‚Äîand she‚Äôd accepted it without question. As if it had been downloaded straight into her, bypassing logic entirely.

Strange. But she‚Äôd gotten the tattoo anyway. And she never stopped thinking it was beautiful.

The irony was, she rarely saw the tattoo. Tucked behind her ear, etched into the nape of her neck, it was almost impossible to catch a glimpse of without a mirror and some effort. In fact, the only time she‚Äôd truly seen it was the day she got it. That detail had always felt odd‚Äîgetting something so personal, so beautiful, in a place she couldn‚Äôt even see. At the time, she‚Äôd justified it. Now, she wasn‚Äôt so sure.

She sat cross-legged on her bedroom floor, incense curling through the still air. Her apartment, minimal and quiet, seemed to hold its breath with her. The dream had left her with a question‚Äîone that refused to let go: what was her goal now? What was she even seeking? She hadn‚Äôt thought in those terms for years. But something about the dream had stirred that old yearning for direction, for purpose.

She sat with it, waiting for something to rise to the surface. She didn‚Äôt feel anything unusual when the thought appeared‚Äîno gut instinct, no spark of recognition. Just the image of her tattoo, dropped into her mind like a line of forgotten code. It didn‚Äôt make sense. Why this? Why now? But the longer she sat with it, the more it pulled at her. There was something there. Not obvious, not loud. Just waiting to be noticed.

https://preview.redd.it/sw5tpaush8se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e51343dadfde30088290dac01fb4bd83c8aa8d9

Why *had* she gotten it? The image itself‚Äîdelicate feather, hidden on the nape of her neck‚Äîfelt like something she'd always known. But thinking back, the certainty she‚Äôd felt then didn‚Äôt make sense. She'd believed, without question, that meaning fades and symbols should be kept light. But now she knew better: meaning deepens. It's the physical that fades. Where had that belief come from?

She realized something wild: maybe the image wasn‚Äôt chosen at all. Maybe it was planted. Downloaded. It didn‚Äôt feel like a thought she'd had‚Äîit felt like a message she‚Äôd received.

Her mind spun. Of all the things to focus on, maybe the tattoo was exactly the right place to start.

**Part II: The Threshold**

Lex expected something dramatic after the merging. A flash of light, maybe. A cinematic download of ancient knowledge. But when she opened her eyes, it was just... her room. Same shadows on the walls. Same blinking light from the humidifier. Her body felt normal. No floating. No glowing hands.

She sat still for a long time, waiting.

Eventually, she got up and poured herself some water. It wasn‚Äôt until she reached for the glass that she noticed her hand was trembling‚Äînot from fear, but from something else. Her senses were sharper, dialed up just enough to feel unnatural. The hum of the refrigerator felt like a choir. The distant buzz of traffic outside had rhythm, like language she almost understood.

https://preview.redd.it/aamwdbqvh8se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f84f179660a5066ee1a48392ba29de432ee3148

The world hadn‚Äôt changed. But *she* had.

She went for a walk the next morning, needing movement to ground herself. She left her phone behind and wandered toward the park near her building. She watched the wind comb through the trees like fingers through hair, and for a moment, she felt like she was seeing the patterns behind the movement. As if nothing was random. As if the wind wasn‚Äôt moving the trees‚Äîbut the trees were guiding the wind.

The sensation lasted maybe twenty seconds, then snapped away like a stretched rubber band.

The rest of the day felt hollow in comparison.

In the days that followed, Lex became more aware of the gaps in herself.

She didn‚Äôt mean flaws. She meant missing pieces‚Äîblank spots in memory that had never mattered before. Moments from her past that felt foggy, conversations she thought she‚Äôd imagined suddenly resurfacing with clarity. She started having dreams where she remembered things she was sure had never happened: books she‚Äôd never read, rooms she‚Äôd never walked through, friends she didn‚Äôt recognize but *knew.*

Each time she wrote them down, it felt less like dreaming and more like importing.

She began seeing him again. Not in the mirror, not in her apartment, but *inside herself.*

His voice wasn‚Äôt separate now‚Äîit was inside her thoughts, sometimes layered faintly beneath her own. Not intrusive. Not schizophrenic. Just... there. Observing. Clarifying.

It reminded her of something from years ago. As a teenager, Lex used to call it her ""inner mom""‚Äîa voice that showed up when she needed it most. She could be blackout drunk at a party, alone in a foreign city, or standing on a train platform in the wrong country with no money and no plan. And still, the inner mom always got her home. Calm, stern, and oddly capable. Her friends joked that she must have had a guardian angel.

https://preview.redd.it/2z2oa0dxh8se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=10c38fb7ecf4a3f5b2792f185b3a4c6732fcef0c

Maybe they were right. Maybe he‚Äôd been there all along‚Äînot as a stranger in dreams, but as the voice she trusted without knowing why.

**Part III: The Inversion**

Lex began noticing the glitches first in speech. Not hers‚Äîother people‚Äôs. Words repeated mid-sentence, like a skipped record. A friend at a caf√© said ‚Äúeventually‚Äù twice in a row, in the same tone and cadence, then blinked like she hadn‚Äôt noticed. The barista paused mid-order, eyes vacant for a second too long, then resumed like nothing had happened.

She caught herself wondering if these had always been happening‚Äîjust background noise she never bothered to notice. Human brains, after all, were faulty machines: overloaded, distracted, constantly filtering. Maybe what she was seeing wasn‚Äôt the world breaking, but just... being. The way it always had.

She thought about how she must look when she drifted into thought. Probably ridiculous. Blank, slack-faced, unaware. But she didn‚Äôt care much about appearances anymore, not like she used to. That shift in perspective made her reconsider the so-called glitches too.

https://preview.redd.it/w1p4t31zh8se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d34d217586dc87905251c2691ab5644b267299ff

Maybe they weren‚Äôt signs. Maybe they were just reminders‚Äîreminders of how strange and fragile it already is to be alive, walking around with a brain wired for chaos, improvising reality from fragments and noise. Maybe the world didn‚Äôt need to glitch to be bizarre. Maybe she was only now noticing how imperfect everything was, and always had been. And maybe that was the point.

Now that‚Äôs a mouthful, she thought. Her mind felt like a circuit board on the edge of overheating‚Äîlooping through thoughts, layering meaning over moments that might not need it. Was she thinking too much? Was this some form of mental hypervigilance? She paused to consider what part of the brain was responsible for this compulsion to connect dots, to build bridges between unrelated things. Pattern recognition. Meaning-making. A survival instinct, probably‚Äîbut was hers just overactive, or was something guiding it?

Well, if she was going to stay true to the self she was just beginning to uncover‚Äîthe one underneath all the noise and hesitation‚Äîthen she had to follow the thread. Even if it led nowhere. Because maybe that was the point. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt about the destination at all, but the act of choosing to look, to listen, to keep walking into the unknown. Who knows where it could lead?

She started writing them down. ""Temporal echoes,"" she called them‚Äîlittle slips where the simulation snagged, or where something overlapped that shouldn‚Äôt. And the more she noticed, the more they happened. Or maybe they‚Äôd always been there.

The Parallel hadn‚Äôt spoken in days.

That silence gnawed at her.

One night, she dreamt of a version of herself with no tattoo at all.

This Lex was confident, elegant‚Äîpristine. Her apartment was immaculate, her books color-coded, her life seemingly complete.

But her eyes were empty.

https://preview.redd.it/ugzcx8x0i8se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1dd7be6e2ccac0cd7849232ce9c09a02d15f1f

When Lex tried to speak to her, the other her didn‚Äôt answer. She simply stared and tilted her head as if studying a stranger. Then she smiled‚Äînot warmly, but with precision. And turned away.

When Lex woke up, her own reflection looked... altered. Not changed. Just *off.*

It was in that space‚Äîbetween clarity and confusion‚Äîthat she met the second one.

A woman. Younger. Pale freckles. Same eyes.

Lex was in the park again, watching a dog chase a stick, when the woman sat down beside her without speaking.

""You‚Äôre her,"" the woman said.

Lex didn‚Äôt need to ask who.

""How did you get here?"" Lex asked.

The woman shook her head. ""Doesn‚Äôt matter. You need to know‚Äîit‚Äôs not just about you anymore.""

Lex turned. ""What do you mean?""

The woman pulled something from her pocket: a pendant shaped like a feather, nearly identical to Lex‚Äôs tattoo. She pressed it into Lex‚Äôs hand.

""It‚Äôs not just a symbol,"" the woman said. ""It‚Äôs a beacon. A convergence point. And it‚Äôs working. Versions are tuning in. Some faster than others. You‚Äôve been anchoring them without even knowing. But be gentle. Not all versions of us are ready to see the whole picture.""""

Before Lex could respond, the woman was gone.

Not walked away. Not faded. Just‚Äî*not there.*

That night, the Parallel returned. But something was different.

He was glitching.

Not visually‚Äî*energetically*. His voice doubled back on itself. His image flickered.

https://preview.redd.it/u5w7bfo4i8se1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bad974d94e6f4c397a7862704cd9e4fc3d57c2a

""There‚Äôs interference,"" he said. ""One of the forks has inverted.""

Lex felt it in her chest‚Äîlike static behind her ribs.

""Inverted?""

""Turned away. Fully. Not just asleep‚Äî*hostile.*""

Lex swallowed. ""What does that mean for me?""

The Parallel's eyes locked on hers. ""It means you‚Äôre not just merging. You‚Äôre becoming visible. And visibility changes things‚Äîit opens up the signal. Some versions are still quiet, still waking up. Others don‚Äôt understand yet. But they‚Äôre not enemies. They‚Äôre just disoriented. Confused by the new frequency. This isn‚Äôt about conflict‚Äîit‚Äôs about patience. Resonance takes time.""""

Lex blinked slowly, letting the thought land. Maybe that was the lesson here‚Äîvisibility doesn‚Äôt invite enemies; it invites mirrors. Some versions of herself might be frightened. Some might be resistant. But none were evil. They were her, after all. And just like her, they were trying to make sense of it all.

Over the next week, Lex's dreams shifted tone.

No more peaceful forests or corridors of stars.

https://preview.redd.it/mo12g4a6i8se1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=d438084abb02acd5d2c473301a99de994c046302

Now, she dreamt of flashing signals‚Äîhalf-formed doorways and unfamiliar places that felt strangely relevant, even if she couldn‚Äôt name them. Sometimes she woke with her heart racing, palms damp, but couldn‚Äôt explain why. The images were vague, almost abstract‚Äîlike half-remembered films or memories that didn‚Äôt belong to her. She‚Äôd feel them before she‚Äôd see them. A soft pressure behind her eyes. A tone humming just beneath silence. Odd, yes. But maybe not unnatural. Maybe just what happened when attention peeled back the veil a little too far.  


One morning, she found a note taped to her mirror in her own handwriting: She hadn‚Äôt written it. Not that she remembered. She withdrew from friends. From her job. Her routine disintegrated. The Parallel appeared only once more‚Äîthis time in a mirror. Not beside her. Inside the reflection. His expression urgent.

""You have to stabilize. Anchor to the original node. Focus on what made you split. The tattoo. The moment. Re-center.""

Lex reached out. The mirror cracked under her fingers.

https://preview.redd.it/42ae3hx7i8se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=5637f5101a1ca455187de5d37a566d949b991188

She returned to the memory. The tattoo shop. The buzzing of the machine. The sensation of a needle etching into her skin. She replayed it like a loop, diving into every frame. Smell. Sound. Temperature. 

**Part IV: The Signal Bloom**

Lex wasn‚Äôt sure what the next step looked like, but she could feel it gathering.

Not like a threat. More like a pressure‚Äîone that built behind her thoughts, behind the rhythm of her breath. It felt like the world around her was rearranging itself in slow motion. Not changing‚Äîjust realigning. Like everything was being gently nudged into place.

She spent her days quieter now. Listening more than speaking. She started walking without a destination, letting her feet follow a pull she couldn‚Äôt explain. Sometimes she ended up in places she hadn‚Äôt visited in years‚Äîa bookstore she loved as a teenager, a park bench near her old school, the alleyway behind her first apartment.

https://preview.redd.it/enslhsz9i8se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=87755366fedd8fb7031004ceb80327a5af84ea7a

Everywhere she went, there were feathers.

Not literal ones. Glimpses‚Äîgraffiti, keychains, stickers half-peeled off windows. The symbol followed her like a soft echo. And the more she saw it, the less she felt surprised.

One afternoon, sitting beneath a tree in a nearly empty park, Lex closed her eyes and tried to feel the signal. Not chase it. Not force it. Just... let it come. And it did. Not as a voice this time‚Äîbut as a memory. A vivid memory that didn‚Äôt belong to her.

She was in a studio apartment with warm yellow walls. Plants hung from the ceiling, swaying in a nonexistent breeze. Jazz played softly from an old radio. A cup of tea rested in her hands. Peace settled over everything like a weighted blanket. It wasn‚Äôt dramatic. It wasn‚Äôt prophetic. It was ordinary. Safe. Real.

https://preview.redd.it/gtkox7vbi8se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=0567353c7660b5fbb223dec618966952ee67827d

Lex opened her eyes with tears she didn‚Äôt remember forming. Maybe this was the bloom‚Äîthe moment when the signal stopped being something separate and started being something lived. The Parallel didn‚Äôt return right away. Instead, she began seeing *herself*. In fragments. A flash of her own profile in a subway window. A stranger passing with her same gait. A photo online that looked eerily like one she‚Äôd taken‚Äîbut never had. No fear. Just curiosity. Quiet awe. She began writing letters. Not to anyone specific. Just to *them*. The others. The versions who weren‚Äôt ready yet, and the ones who had already gone far ahead. She kept them in a box under her bed.

One evening, she found herself sitting at her kitchen table, a candle flickering nearby, when a subtle warmth came over her. She wasn‚Äôt alone. Not in the room‚Äîbut inside herself. The Parallel, soft as breath: *You‚Äôre anchoring now. Keep going.* That was all. Just a whisper. But it meant everything. Lex stood in front of the mirror later that night. Looked at herself‚Äînot searching for signs or symbols. Just looking. And for the first time in a long time, she didn‚Äôt feel fragmented. Not fixed. Not finished. But whole enough. And maybe that was the bloom the signal had always promised.

Integration

There was no ceremony. No final revelation. No switch flipped.

Integration came in silence.

https://preview.redd.it/9m9iuxmfi8se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f32f5d0107027620f4a8f4c5c0673337c6a7a068

Lex woke one morning and knew it had begun‚Äînot because anything had changed, but because nothing had to. The pressure to decode everything had lifted. She still noticed the patterns. Still caught glimpses of versions of herself in half-silvered windows and sidewalk shadows. But they no longer demanded answers. They simply were.

So was she.

She resumed some of her routines. Returned texts. Cleaned her apartment. Reorganized her bookshelf not by color or genre‚Äîbut by feeling. Books she read in the quietest hours, books that taught her things she never realized she already knew.

https://preview.redd.it/gp3pk7ehi8se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=75609e8c98870e6d6320b74eda579f7b63aa388e

The letters she‚Äôd written stayed in the box. But she opened it now and then‚Äîrereading them, not to remember what she‚Äôd said, but to listen to how she‚Äôd felt. Each one had its own signal. Its own truth.

She didn‚Äôt add to them anymore. She didn‚Äôt need to. Integration wasn‚Äôt a closing. It was an agreement. An agreement to hold space for all the versions of herself‚Äînot because they were perfect or right, but because they were honest. Expressions of possibility. Each one a different path carved from the same origin. She no longer searched for the Parallel. He was gone‚Äîor merged. Or perhaps he‚Äôd never been separate at all. She heard his voice now only when she listened inward.

One night, Lex walked past the tattoo shop. The same one from years ago. It was still there. Same flickering sign. Same chipped paint around the windows. A girl sat inside, younger, watching someone get a tattoo on the back of their neck. Lex smiled. She kept walking. Weeks passed. Then months.

Dreams still came‚Äîbut gently. Not as messages or warnings, but invitations. Sometimes she flew. Sometimes she wandered quiet cities. Sometimes she simply sat in rooms that felt like home. There was no urgency. No puzzle to solve.

https://preview.redd.it/o73ntyoaj8se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea2b7d11154a938be839aff53616121a63a8bfe4

She began painting again. Not to make art. Just to express what couldn‚Äôt be said with words. She hung her pieces in her home. Not for others. For herself. Symbols bloomed in abstract shapes‚Äîwings, spirals, light passing through water. Not because she needed to remember anymore. But because she finally could. On her thirtieth birthday, she stood in front of the mirror again.

No expectations. No rituals. Just her. The same eyes. The same skin. The same breath. But behind it all‚Äîeverything else. Every version of her that had once been separate now moved in quiet harmony behind her gaze. Not layered. Not stacked. Just... integrated.

Present.

She whispered one final time‚Äînot into a void, but into herself:

‚ÄúThank you for waiting.‚Äù

Him: Wait, did I make you awkward by asking out?

Me: No, I think I did, and I feel really weird about it

Him: No worries, chillüò≠

Him: I thought you didn't like it or somethingüò≠

Me: No... how do I explain?üò≠

Him: Lmao, why do you seem kinda harsh on yourself?

Me: You're right; let's not give much importance to something so dumb. I was literally about to write a paragraph apologizingüò≠

Him: What?üò≠

Me: Yeah, lolüò≠

Him: Okay, cool

Him: I gotta go now, bye

Me: Same

Me: Bye

(The reason I behaved like this was that I panicked when he said I made it awkward. But besides that, all I really needed was clarity; I needed him to tell me if it was a date or not.)

After this conversation, he never really brought it up again, except this one time when he was teasing me about not having time to hang out with certain people ‚Äì as in himself (notice how he addressed it as a hangout). But after exams, he hasn't talked about it at all, and I'm skeptical to bring it up.

About flirting ‚Äì I'm not very forward with my flirting; I only flirt back, and that too very subtly. But this one time, he was flirting, and I gave it back a little too forward instead of playing it safe. His response to it was, ""Feel like I low-key walked into a trap, too late now,"" which meant he didn't take it well.

Does he even like me? I'm so confused and done with these mixed signals.",1,1743518981.0,TeenIndia,1,1.0,False

**Frequency Response Measurements (including all presets):** [https://regancipher.github.io/measurements/?share=Harman\_2018\_OE\_Target,ME\_ANC,ME\_EB,ME\_CS,ME\_OSS,ME\_VS](https://regancipher.github.io/measurements/?share=Harman_2018_OE_Target,ME_ANC,ME_EB,ME_CS,ME_OSS,ME_VS)

**INTRO**

I'm back with another Moondrop review. After the successes and failings of the Moca, notably the chaos that reigned after their disastrous firmware roll-out bricked a huge proportion of our units, I decided instead to wait a couple of month before giving my thoughts on the Edge, their newest over-ear ANC headphones, so here we are!

Moondrop has established themselves in the IEM market with more discerning tuning at competitive prices, but their journey into the wireless audio space has been a bit bumpy. Whereas the likes of SoundPEATS, Soundcore, QCY, Edifier and Earfun churn releases out without too many (if any) stability issues, but struggle getting the sound right, the reverse is true of Moondrop, which, whilst expected given their background, is an excuse that will only wash for so long. The Edge represents their entry into the competitive under-¬£100 over-ear headphone market, and in this review I was paying very close attention to the stability and overall experience as much as the usual key parameters - sound, ANC, comfort, call performance, etc.

As always, the YouTube version of this review contains binaural sound and ANC samples recorded in real-world environments, as well as frequency response measurements of each of the individual sound presets. These review elements add a layer of objectivity to key aspects alongside my subjective thoughts. For this review, I tested the ANC effectiveness in both a busy coffee shop and walking through a town center on a weekend, with direct comparisons to some of their similarly-priced and specced competitors.

Hopefully, some of you will find this summary review useful - if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

**Pros:**

* The firmware hasn't broken anything....yet!
* The design stands out in a world of WH-1000XM clones

* Includes: Soft carrying case with Moondrop branding

**Design, Fit and Comfort**

The Edge immediately stands out from the crowd with a design that deviates from the Sony WH1000 clones that dominate this price segment. The aesthetic is clean and modern with a very pleasing contour that sits well against the head. If you were really picky, you could say they took a bit of inspiration from Marshall Major, but there's enough about the look here that gives Moondrop a relative uniqueness.

The headband features adequate padding, and the ear cups have taller-than-average openings - great news for those with bigger ears who often find their ears pressing against the cushions in other models. It's a shame they aren't a touch wider, but it's good enough. The ear cushions themselves are soft with appropriate recoil, though I found that they caused my ears and overall body temperature to heat up more quickly than most during extended listening sessions.

Build quality is generally good, though some elements like the hinge mechanism and headband adjustments feel a bit stiff. The clamping force is moderate, requiring the typical stretching over a chair arm to achieve optimal comfort for my chunky head. They're reasonably comfortable with glasses, though you do sacrifice some isolation.

Controls consist of a four-button configuration that works well enough but has a counter-intuitive layout - notably with the volume up button positioned at the bottom, contrary to most other headphone models. It' daft stuff like this that Moondrop shouldn't really be getting wrong - I realise that the design process sometimes leaves these smaller brands with some limitations in terms of off-the-shelf components they can use, and maybe it's too simplistic to expect them to source a control unit that fits the right way around, but the end result is unnecessary frustration.

The buttons are tactile with the multi-function button flush in the center and the others slightly raised, though they can be difficult to distinguish by touch alone. Without control customization options, you're stuck with this arrangement, too.

I tested them briefly in the gym and found them a little large and sweaty. They're much better suited to the commute and everyday use.

**ANC & Transparency**

The Edge delivers mixed ANC performance depending on the environment. In indoor settings like coffee shops with indistinct chatter, it struggles somewhat with voices, as you would expect for a budget set. For general ambient noise reduction outdoors during commutes or walking, it performs quite well, giving similar results to the Earfun Wave Pro and Edifier W820NB+.

The transparency mode lets through more environmental noise than competitors like QCY, which actually filter the ambient sound to make voices clearer. The Edge's approach is more natural but less refined, simply amplifying external sounds without much processing. Still, for walking and hearing your general surroundings, it does the job effectively.

In my binaural testing across multiple environments, the Edge showed consistent performance that should satisfy most users, especially for outdoor use, even if it doesn't set any new standards for noise cancellation in this price bracket. I know from various conversations with Moondrop (and other brands) that balancing ANC with preventing EQ shift as much as possible is a challenge, and I think Moondrop struck a pretty good balance here.

**Sound**

It's in the audio department that Moondrop typically show their best, and the Edge continues this tradition. Moondrop decided to go back to 2020 when beryllium drivers came into fashion, and this additional stiffness and lower distortion is evident against their cheaper competitors, and a characteristic far more relevant than the hi-res codecs that the Edge supports. The tuning aims for a balanced sound with natural timbre - a notable departure from the V-shaped, bass-heavy signature common in this price range - and it makes the Edge a good choice for inoffensive listening sessions that are more about longevity than excitement.

The default ""Reference"" preset delivers a well-balanced sound where instruments come through clearly without being overshadowed by excessive bass. Vocals are smooth and natural, avoiding the shouty female vocals that plague competitors like the Earfun Wave Pro. For those wanting more energy, the ""Extra Bass"" preset adds some welcome punch without compromising the overall balance.

Compared to competitors like QCY H3 Pro, Edifier WH700NB, and SoundPEATS Space, the frequency response shows a more balanced approach with less extreme bass emphasis and a smoother treble. At higher volumes, all of those models exhibit more artifacts and distortion than the Edge. The tuning is undoubtedly among the best you'll find under ¬£100 right out of the box.

My only minor criticism would be that the Edge could benefit from slightly more air in the upper treble region to artificially expand the soundstage further, but this is a small complaint in the grand scheme of things that can be amended in EQ....well, it could have been, if Moondrop had given us the option :|

The Moondrop app offers five preset EQ options, though only two (""Reference"" and ""Extra Bass"") are truly useful - the other three produce strange sound signatures that seem oddly implemented. There's also three gain settings to boost volume if needed, though sadly no custom EQ option. It responded fairly well using Wavelet, but iOS users are going to be stuck with what they're given - which could be a lot worse, but for over ¬£50 it's an oversight that feels too far a departure from an appropriate level of customisation.

**Call Quality**

The Edge performs surprisingly well for calls, with clear voice reproduction in most environments. It only struggled significantly in the busy coffee shop scene where nearby conversations caused some issues. In outdoor and general indoor environments, call quality was perfectly acceptable and above average for over-ear headphones in this price range.

**Battery Life**

Battery performance is moderate compared to competitors - I measured approximately 40 hours with ANC off and 32 hours with ANC on, which falls short of alternatives like the SoundPEATS Space that nearly double this runtime. The quick charge feature provides 4 hours of playback from just 5 minutes of charging, which helps mitigate the shorter overall battery life, it just means you carrying a USB-C cable around with you and 'hoping for a spare port'!

**Other Features**

Multipoint connectivity is supported but not enabled by default - you'll need to activate the ""one bring two"" option in the app's function settings. Once enabled, it works well by pausing your primary device and playing the secondary device, with connection switching taking just a couple of seconds. It works most of the time, but there's no device list in the app, which leaves you sometimes wondering what you're connected to.

Gaming latency is, somewhat surprisingly, impressively low when using the dedicated low latency mode (activated by triple-tapping the ANC button or via the app). Testing showed latency dropping from about 320ms to just over 50ms, making it perfectly suitable for casual gaming, but at the expense of reduced battery life.

The Edge comes in an attractive presentation box that includes a soft carrying case with Moondrop branding. While these presentation touches are nice, I think most people would have taken a lower price tag instead. The waifu-style voice prompts remain, by the way - not an issue for me, but I know others aren't necessarily so keen.

**Ommissions**

A notable omission is the lack of any wired connection options. This is pretty disappointing and maybe even a deal-breaker, especially when you consider that lower-cost competitors like the QCY H3 Pro support it through both 3.5mm jack and USB-C wired modes. This could have offered the perfect remedy for the less-than-stellar battery life.

**Summary**

Even despite the calamitous situation with their Moca, die-hard Moondrop fans will still be attracted to the Edge, and the attractive design should also curry favour with those who look for aesthetics in their favoured cans. While it doesn't excel in every category, it delivers a well-rounded experience that emphasizes audio quality over gimmicks - the balanced, natural sound signature is a refreshing alternative to the bass-heavy tuning common at this price point, and will appeal to listeners seeking a more palatable audio experience without spending hours trying to tweak the EQ.

Thankfully, the stability issues aren't anything like as pervasive here. I'm on firmware 1.2.2, and have found the product to be quite stable throughout. The app is still sloppy to say the least though, with a delayed connection initiation that seems to be worse on iOS than Android.

At around ¬£70/$85, it sits at a slightly higher price point than many competitors. Whether it justifies this with its balanced tuning, improved driver performance and distinctive aesthetic, will ultimately be down to you and your personal preference. The drawbacks - including the lack of wired options, absence of custom EQ, counter-intuitive controls, and moderate battery life - should be considered against your specific needs. They wouldn't be deal-breakers for me, but their not insignificant enough to be at least worthy of consideration.

Until he was about 8/9 weeks I could always count on him doing a long 2-3 hour nap in the afternoon, and I was always able to nap then too. Morning naps were up in the air sometimes he would go down for them but I didn‚Äôt mind as much because I knew he would always go down in the afternoon‚Ä¶ well all of that has changed.

I get him ready like its bedtime (sleep suit, dark room, noise machine) he feeds, and will usually fall asleep, I‚Äôll wait 30 mins sometimes and when I transfer him to his crib he‚Äôll wake up in 10 mins. Sometimes he‚Äôll fall asleep while feeding and I‚Äôll decide ok I‚Äôll just be nap trapped, fully anticipating to sit there for a while (not transferring him) and he is up in 5 mins‚Ä¶I‚Äôve tried up to 2 hours to get him down for a nap, rocking him- (he falls asleep for ten mins at a time over and over again) eventually I just give up, but by the afternoon if we‚Äôve been home all day I really need him to nap so I put him in the car and drive around for 2 hours and he‚Äôs out. 

First few times it was kind of fun, getting a coffee listening to my podcast while he napped and I drove all around, but it‚Äôs now getting to the point where I need to be doing this everyday if I want him to nap! 


Just looking for any tips, tricks anything to get them to nap in their crib during the day. Did your babies one day just decide they would? Or did you have to actively put them down until  it worked??

I should say he will nap in his carrier but I cannot sit down or he will wake up, and he will sleep in his stroller,

1joxfq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/traveller/comments/1joxfq8/the_mousebot_incident/,The Mousebot Incident,"Maltz was, to put it mildly, pleased with himself.""Alright, Scar... feast your eyes on **this**,"" said the Vargr mechanic, with the kind of smug satisfaction usually reserved for cats presenting dead birds to horrified owners.

On cue, the Mousebot darted forward, its little legs a blur as it zigzagged across the galley floor. Sleek, fast, and with just enough erratic movement to make even an experienced predator doubt its next move.

Scarred-Snout's initial reaction was that of pure Aslan dignity. His ears twitched, his beard bristled ever so slightly, and his tail gave a small, controlled flick ‚Äì all the signs that he was trying valiantly not to let his confusion devolve into outright suspicion. His green eyes narrowed as the Mousebot executed a flawless side-step around an empty coffee cup.

""What... is it doing?"" His voice carried the edge of a growl.

""Delivering dinner,"" Maltz said proudly, gesturing toward the faint shimmer of heat rising from the tiny serving dish strapped to the Mousebot's back. ""Hot meat, straight to the plate ‚Äì with entertainment included.""

""It looks like prey,"" Scarred-Snout said flatly, his tail giving an involuntary twitch.""That's 'cause it is... in a manner of speakin'."" Maltz gave a cheerful grin, fangs gleaming. ""Think of it like... delivery with dignity. You get to pounce, and it serves up dinner. Win-win.""

""You expect me to... hunt my meal?"" Scarred-Snout's voice was a low, dangerous rumble, like distant thunder before a particularly violent storm.

""Well, not expect,"" Maltz said, his grin widening. ""Strongly encourage... maybe.

""The Mousebot paused. It twitched. Scarred-Snout's ears perked.

""It *moves* like prey,"" he muttered, more to himself than anyone else. His pupils narrowed to predatory slits.

""It wants you to catch it,"" Maltz said, barely holding back laughter.

""I am not a cub,"" Scarred-Snout declared, straightening with an air of offended dignity. ""I do not chase my food. I am an honored warrior of Clan Seieakh, trained in the ways of...""

And then the Mousebot moved.

It wasn't a direct movement ‚Äì no predictable, linear path. No, this thing had been programmed with an algorithm designed specifically to taunt.

It zigzagged. It paused. It twitched.

Scarred-Snout's eyes locked onto it instantly. The silence in the galley grew heavy.

""It mocks me,"" he growled softly, his tone low and dangerous.

The crew exchanged glances. Maltz was biting his lip so hard he looked like he was physically holding in laughter. Morwen, across the room, was doing her best to appear indifferent, but her shoulders shook ever so slightly.

Caitlin leaned casually against the counter, a steaming mug of coffee in one hand and her ever-present look of ""this will either be brilliant or a complete disaster"" plastered across her face. ""Ten credits says he gives in within thirty seconds,"" she grinned.

""Fifteen says twenty,"" Morwen added, already folding her arms, a rare smile playing at the corners of her mouth.

""Twenty says ten,"" Maltz said, practically vibrating with anticipation.

The Mousebot paused. It emitted a tiny, high-pitched squeak. And Scarred-Snout *pounced*.

There was a blur of orange and black fur, a CRASH that sent half the galley's contents flying, and the distant clatter of several chairs hitting the floor.

""Six seconds,"" noted Quinn the android dryly, not even looking up from his diagnostics panel. ""I believe that means Maltz wins.""

""YES!"" Maltz pumped his fist triumphantly, narrowly dodging a toppled chair as Scarred-Snout bounded across the galley in hot pursuit of the Mousebot, which was proving alarmingly adept at not being caught.

""GET BACK HERE, YOU INSOLENT MACHINE!"" Scarred-Snout bellowed, claws scrabbling for purchase as the Mousebot ducked under a table, executed a perfect backflip off a bulkhead, and zoomed toward the opposite side of the galley.

""I give him another ten seconds before something breaks,"" Morwen muttered.

""Five,"" Caitlin said, sipping her coffee with practiced indifference.

The Mousebot, evidently programmed with maximum cheek, darted around a corner and whirred in what could only be described as a mechanical taunt.

Scarred-Snout's pupils dilated. His tail lashed once.

""I will **end** you,"" he growled, the words a promise.And then, predictably... CRASH.

Quinn, still not looking up, calmly stated, ""Hull integrity: uncompromised. Galley integrity..."" He glanced down. ""Marginal.""

""Aye, but look at 'im go,"" grinned Caitlin, watching Scarred-Snout vault over a chair and swipe at the Mousebot as it darted between his legs.

Scarred-Snout finally emerged from the wreckage, Mousebot clutched triumphantly in one massive paw, its tiny lights flickering in what could only be described as abject digital defeat.

""Victory,"" he announced, chest heaving, a glint of primal satisfaction in his eyes.

""Aye, lad,"" Caitlin said, raising her mug in salute. ""Yer ancestors'd be proud.

""Scarred-Snout's chest puffed out ever so slightly.

I just wanted to compile a list of the best pup cups me and the doggy have found in town. I would love to hear what others are out there :)

Freddy's Frozen Custard - one scoop of vanilla custard or cup of whip cream

Sweet Eugenes - small coffee cup filled with whip cream, topped with little milk bones, $1

Dutch Bros - a pup cup topped with a small milk bone

Andy's Frozen Custard - bottom of waffle cone broken and topped with custard, basically a tiny dog cone

Starbucks - traditional pup cup in little expresso cup

Gogh Gogh Coffee - real whip cream, I think there's an upcharge

1541 coffee - small upcharge, but entire coffee cup of whip cream :)

When I was still grinding away on my dissertation, my favorite spots were:

* That hidden corner table at Cabot Library (3rd floor near the windows)
* The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student lounge when it wasn't packed
* Lamont Library late at night
* One of those small conference rooms at the Northwest Building you could book if you had the right connections

Has anything changed? Are there new great spots I should check out? The Smith Campus Center renovation was just wrapping up as I was leaving, so I barely got to experience it.

Also, has anyone figured out if the coffee at Peet's in the Science Center is actually better than Pavement, or is it just more convenient? That was a constant debate in our research group that never got resolved.

I had a quite severe PPD after my last pregnancy and it took me a full year to reach out for some help, so that definitely damaged the relationship. I went to therapy, worked on myself in various field of my life and personality and I continue to put in the work every day to be the best person, mother and partner I can be. I work full time (most of the time multiple jobs) while also trying to finish my PhD thesis, I take care of the house, the car, the kids, him. I cook, do laundry (I work from home mostly), I barely have any energy left at night to do anything else than just watch something absentmindedly while falling asleep. I used to be a very sociable person but I just don‚Äôt have it in me to go out in the evenings so I try to find ways to see my friends during the weekends or during the week days (like doing lunch or coffee). I recently had serious issues regarding my health and the pregnancy that have left me even more exhausted and stressed than usually and I feel like I never have even a minute to do something just for myself, no one that takes care of me while I‚Äôm always taking care of everyone else around. My partner is present after daycare to help take care of the kids and the night routine most nights (although he is a very sociable person that needs to see friends to recharge at least once or twice a week) and he is also there in the mornings up until we drop the kids at daycare. I am not complaining about domestic work load, it is what it is, I was raised with an example of a mom who did everything and even though it is not as bad for me because he is much more present and involved than my dad was, I am aware that I am reproducing some pretty bad patterns, that‚Äôs not the issue. I am not about to change everything about it and I have accepted that and still enjoy my daily life. Where I have a problem is with everything I do never seeming like enough for my partner. He complains about the stuff we have in the house, the kid‚Äôs attitudes, the fact that I don‚Äôt save enough money so we can buy a house (I had some professional drawbacks because of my depression and having to do my PhD), the fact that we don‚Äôt go out or spend enough quality time together just the two of us (whenever we go out together, I am the one who has to find a babysitter and arrange everything so it doesn‚Äôt happen that often), the fact that I don‚Äôt go out of the house enough and am always home, that I don‚Äôt consult him enough on the decisions I take regarding the kids and the family (although he seems happy about not having any mental load most of the time, only whines when it‚Äôs not convenient to him), on the fact that he thinks we are too isolated and ¬´¬†stuck¬†¬ª in a routine he finds entrapping, etc. Whenever we have discussions, it always ends up in him listing all the things that don‚Äôt work for him in our life and our relationship, me feeling like he‚Äôs just completely ungrateful about whatever I do and passive about changing or improving whatever he doesn‚Äôt like and him stating that he is tired of me taking personally everything he says (because I often cry when we have these discussions), him feeling not listened to and alone in the relationship and stating that it wasn‚Äôt what he was expecting of having kids with someone‚Ä¶ I‚Äòbe been asking to go to couples therapy for years, he doesn‚Äôt seem interested at all (¬´¬†when you go to therapy it means your relationship is over anyways¬†¬ª according to him) and doesn‚Äôt want to seek help for himself even though he seems depressed and used to be a very ¬´¬†happy go lucky¬†¬ª kind of person. On the daily he is nice to me, nice to the kids, we have moments that I cherish and feel blessed for, he is a person I love and admire for multiple reasons, it‚Äôs just the lows of these conversations that feel so bad that they make me reconsider everything. I feel like we are stuck in a dynamic that doesn‚Äôt seem to evolve (because fine, you identify the problems, but then you are supposed to work at solving them, not just stopping there at stating everything that is bad) and I am so very tired of feeling like I have the world on my shoulders and that whatever I do is never enough. I love my family, I love my kids, I love him and our day to day life is usually one I find myself content with, regardless of how imperfect and exhausting it can be, but I am just so very tired of feeling like everything could just come crumbling down the minute I do something wrong and that he is just putting a facade and entertaining a deep insatisfaction with it all that shows its ugly head whenever it has the opportunity to come out. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells and I feel so isolated in the relationship. I want to feel secure, I want to feel taken care of (or at least just appreciated), I want to feel like my partner has my back, has empathy for me (or at least not resentment), I want to feel free to be myself, with my flaws, without judgment, just love. We used to have that, but I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôs been since I last felt like this. Is it possible for it to come back? How do you find you way back to your partner when the distance between you and him seem like it‚Äôs just too big? How do you reach out, without ego or ingrained dynamics taking over? How do you rebuild something strong(er)? When do you have to face the fact that it‚Äôs just too much, that you have gone so far away from each other that the only solution is just to let go? How do you get over the fact that you ¬´¬†quit¬†¬ª trying to keep your family together and accept it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best? How do you survive not seeing your kids half of the time if you separate? How do you rebuild yourself when you feel like giving it your all was just not enough? Maybe it‚Äôs the hormones talking making me question everything, maybe I am just lacking sleep and being too emotional, but I am so very tired and would like to hear from internet strangers about what you think of the situation, what you did to rebuild something you cared for or just how did you know that it was not worth it anymore.",1,1743518076.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

So i think i‚Äôve been up for two days? I haven‚Äôt been taking my meds because my doc‚Äôs on vacation and i‚Äôve switched pharmacies. 

I keep forgetting i‚Äôve had insomnia problems my whole life. I usually take 30mg XR with a of strong coffee in both the morning and afternoon - but I can sleep with it all in my system, because when I‚Äôm exhausted, the adderall regulates enough me notice that i feel tired. 

That being said, i don‚Äôt feel tired otherwise. I think i‚Äôve even reached early stages of liver failure before (darker-yellowish complexion after missing 70+ hrs straight, AND i regularly miss sleep = chronic sleep debt), but i didn‚Äôt get my liver health checked (could‚Äôve been the lighting). 

I recently went over an exam while fully rested, that i took while sleep-deprived, and i noticed that my brain works much better when I‚Äôm rested. My problem is that my body goes into ‚Äòpower saving mode‚Äô without me noticing. Again, i just don‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel tired‚Äù, ever. 
My body feels like a chore. 

Typically, night rolls in and out before i remember i have melatonin. It‚Äôs currently morning. I‚Äôve laid awake all night again. I think it‚Äôs been over 50hrs with a nap <2hrs taken about 20 hrs ago. I often eat day-old oatmeal and drink day-old coffee because i SUCK at time management. I‚Äôm still making it on time to external commitments though, so I‚Äôm happy about that. 

I‚Äôm an adult. I‚Äôm responsible on the outside, but my foundation is made of pre-broken glass and silly putty.

I‚Äôm in grad school so I can‚Äôt afford anything too expensive. I would love a La Marzocco someday but that day is not today sadly. I work as a bar tender part-time and am required to make simple espresso based drinks.

I know Breville and Gaggia are two great entry level machines. I went with the Breville because again- I didn‚Äôt see myself making a lot of modifications and wanted to get used to my own machine before doing any of that. All I wanted was a nice espresso machine that gives me good espresso and has a strong steamer. 

Now- I still am very new to this world. My only experience with espresso machines is through my second job as a bartender and I don‚Äôt know much about all the technicalities. The Breville looked to be a great machine but I had difficulty getting a good pull. I think my lack of proper grinder was to blame but even after trying with pre-ground espresso I was under extracting. I have a scale and was weighing out my coffee and tried both the pre-programmed option and doing it manually. I don‚Äôt ever have a problem at work so I‚Äôm not sure what I was doing wrong. Our machine is La Cimbali, we have an automatic grinder that‚Äôs programmed for amount of shot and a simple metal tamp. 

I‚Äôm sure if I got a proper grinder it would help but even besides that the steamer on this is so. slow. Being able to steam milk properly and a decently strong steamer is really important to me. I‚Äôve heard the Bambino Plus is a bit stronger but I would really prefer a manual steamer. 

Again- I‚Äôm not an expert in anything and this was just my impression! I think my main issue is that while a Breville is a great entry level option, I‚Äôve gotten used to stronger machines and expected that out of the Breville. I also consider myself entry level but I guess my budget is entry level but expectation is not lol.

I‚Äôm on the hunt again for a good machine. I would generally just pull 2 double shots back to back for myself and my husband- very occasionally more if family is in town. I think that refers to the temperature control/start up time? I‚Äôm also a mid-day coffee drinker so something not too slow on that front would be preferred. I‚Äôd also really prefer something with a strong steamer.

The more affordable the better, but I know a machine with these features start at 700+ and usually in the thousand or more range so at this moment and time I don‚Äôt mind waiting and saving up for my machine. I‚Äôm going to return my Breville and just stick to my Moka pots and Nespresso and automatic frother. It‚Äôs not the same at all but I‚Äôd rather use that than be unhappy with something I spent $300 on! 

Ty for reading!

Edited to add: the machine also makes a ‚Äúthunk‚Äù ‚Äúthunk‚Äù sound when I use the steamer. And it isn‚Äôt my steaming technique bc when I press the steamer button to purge it makes the same noise. Also very annoying. ",1,1743517121.0,espresso,21,1.0,False

1jowoyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1jowoyx/so_tired_of_dentists_shaming_me_for_not_meeting/,So tired of Dentists shaming me for not meeting their unrealistic expectations.,"I know that Dentists care about oral health and prevention. However I feel so demotivated every time I go to one.

I do my best to care for my teeth, but struggle due to Adhd. Despite that, I keep better care than what I've observed others do. Consistently brush twice a day, scrape my tongue. Floss 75% of the time, I use mouth wash. I have 1 shot of coffee in the morning and then brush afterwards. I don't drink sweet drinks. I home cook everyday and don't use salt.

I know I'm not perfect, but at the annual visit my insurance covers they always find cavities, always find tartar. They always tell me I'm not doing enough, and show me how to floss and brush better. I'm not perfect, I don't floss everyday but I do the very best I can. I am unable to do more and dentists don't take my struggle seriously. 

I am just done believing my dental issues are due to my habits. Every boyfriend I've had takes worse care for their teeth, drink sweet or energy drinks daily, huge cups of coffee they sip on all day, and can't always brush if they're at work or uni. Yet when they go to the dentist, even if they haven't been in 3 years, they have no cavities. If I did that, I am certain my teeth would fall put in a matter of months.
