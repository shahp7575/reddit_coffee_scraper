1h5djx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1h5djx3/worst_first_date_ever/,Worst first date ever.,"So I (20F) went out on a date wirh the guy (21M) but 2 hours before that he texts me and says ""i'm too drunk sorry I love you tho"" and I was like okay how bad can it be yk?

So we were at the coffee shop, he was behaving okay so I didn't really worry about that. After we finished our drinks, I told him that we should go to the park for a walk, because I don't really feel well at closed places and we barely could hear each other talking because of the music in the background. 

So we got up and when we've arrived, I saw the benches so I told him ""let's sit and talk"" because we've barely talked at the coffee shop. And he was like ""sure"". As I kept talking to him, he takes out the weed and starts smoking. And as someone (me) who never really smoked that before, I was thinking that he would still behave decent so I just ignored that. He did ask me whether it's bothering me, but I said ""I don't mind"" because like, he was already way too into it, few smokes in. 

Suddenly, someone throws firecracker right next to us, and I got scared and told him to get up so we can leave the place. 
As he got up, he walked a few steps then all of sudden fell down and got his head hit onto the (cement) floor. He got too high + drunk. I tried to wake him up, when I turned him back around I saw that his head started bleeding a lot. I started panicking and texted his sister about it and told her to come, but she was at work. 

I helped him to get up and sat him on the bench, told him to wait untl I get some water and tissues. When I came back, I started cleaning his wound and putting water on him and touching him with my hands (because my hands were really cold so thought that would wake him up enough), people started approaching me and asking what happened, but I just said that he accidentally fell down. His sister told me ""girl just leave him there"" but I felt too sorry for him and I was afraid for him to let him go back home on his own so I took him home all the way to his door, because there were a lot of stairs. 
Explained everything to his mother then left. 

It was honestly really bad, but before all that happened, it was really nice and he was being very sweet, but I hope he finally stops harming himself because he's much more than that.

I'm not sure whether we will date for long, but as long as he doesn't get drunk and high while we are on dates, it should be fine, I think.",1,1733194721.0,dating,1,1.0,False
1h5diw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1h5diw5/in_need_of_some_positivity_and_hope/,In need of some positivity and hope ,"hey everyone, I (22f) began having symptoms of SIBO back in early 2021. It started with chronic constipation and extreme fatigue. As time has gone on I’ve learned to live with it, but in November 2022 I began my natural path wellness journey. I began seeing a new doctor who finally took my symptoms seriously and she concluded I had SIBO. So I did a food allergen panel test to determine what foods to avoid and I got a ton of supplements. HOWEVER at the time I was a 19 year old in college and didn’t really care that much about all this, I was drinking and smoking all the time and didn’t stick with my treatment plan and just tolerated the constipation by taking miralax and drinking excessive energy drinks. 

Well. Now, I care a lot more about my heal since then. I have significantly reduced my drinking, quit nicotine, stopped smoking weed. My SIBO symptoms are horrible and I have no energy and just want to feel slightly better. I am in severe pain from my SIBO and have resumed treatment for it. I have since had the GI-MAP stool test which showed that my pancreas is not producing enough enzymes and my gut bacteria is terribly throw off. I am prescribed 9 different supplements and my doctor has ordered me to be gluten free, dairy free, sugar free and no soy, yeast, corn, tomato, coffee or alcohol. As a senior in college I feel like this is impossible being on a tight budget and  the stress of school. I am constantly drained of energy, I am lethargic, my stomach aches all the time and I haven’t been able to spend as much time with my friends. This diet is going to be torturous.

It chitters in response and you empty the clip, but fail to crack its exoskeleton.  You run towards the living room.  You need a weapon to protect yourself from this… *degenerate*.  You trip and stumble into the couch.

Upon being hired I was never asked to fill out a TD1 and TD1BC form. I asked the owner of the company about this and he mentioned that I am a “contractor” and I should file my own taxes during tax season. 

After looking into this a bit more I realized this is illegal. I am providing work for the company, I am using company materials, I am payed an hourly wage, I have a set schedule and do not set my own hours. He is illegally hiring employees and calling them “contractors” likely to get around paying taxes. Other employees told me they get payed exactly what they worked and no tax is taken out of their paycheques. No paystub is provided. 

I have been uncomfortable with this. On top of other issues. He has very high standards for work, he micromanages, he gives very short deadlines for a large amount of work. This is so unreasonable for just one person. He is very stuck in his ways and does not listen to feedback from other employees. If you complain there is too much work you’ll just be told to use chat GPT. This is unrealistic as you still have to go through and validate and polish the prompts given by AI which takes time! It’s like he doesn’t understand this at all. The working conditions have been so difficult and the other employees seem to agree with this. We are all here because we can’t find anything else better. 

Due to all these issues I decided to quit after a very short amount of time. I have yet to receive a paycheque so I gave the owner a due date to send me payment. I reminded him that under the law I am an employee and not a contractor, therefore I demanded a paystub with the correct tax deducted and told him I expect a T4 during tax season. He said he would forward this to his accountant. 

In addition he also tried to dispute the amount of hours I worked. For my first shift. the date and time was sent to me via email but he did not include this on the online schedule. Therefore he is claiming I didn’t work that day. He is also deducting hour for the breaks. For 5 hour shifts a 15 minute coffee break is deducted. For 7-8 hour shifts a 1 hour break is deducted. However it was never communicated to me that the breaks would be mandatory and unpaid. There’s nothing in the contract about this. So I had worked through these breaks and I am demanding to be payed for it. I threatened the owner that I would escalate to the employment standards branch if I am not payed. 

He said he is forwarding all this to his legal council and accountant. Should I be concerned? What do I do? ",4,1733193651.0,legaladvicecanada,2,1.0,False

For 2-3 weeks, he said he is too old to fight over small issues like food, ration. And the minute he gets a chance, he does exactly that.

He cannot handle his own group and tries to act like mitti ka tel to destroy other people's friendships unsuccessfully.

None of his fights have any logic or substance. He picked on Sara, Eden, Kashish for irrelevant issues. Vivian hanging out with 20 years younger persons is way better than KV fighting like a Nibba with Eisha, Avinash. For all his talks of maturity, he is most immature. Only he cud take someone's razor and then, gaslight it into big issue when a mature person in his place wud have simply apologized.

It is good that his PR game is strong bcoz he has no game in the house.",0,1733193303.0,biggboss,1,0.39,False

Threatening to cancel drivers license if I do not attend. ,"In February of this year I had a seizure most likely related to benzo withdrawals. I was referred to a neurologist and attended the appointment after so the neurologist ordered an EEG and stated if I do not attend this EEG she will suspend my drivers license making it illegal for me to drive… 

Looking into the facts and circumstances around my seizure I do not think I am an epileptic(I could be wrong!) I have had a very big problem with benzodiazepine medications in the past where I have been to the point of having 6-8mg of counterfeit “Xanax” per day 
If I were to stop this dose abruptly I would get horrible withdrawals and seizures im assuming related to abruptly stopping benzos as any person would! Coming to the realisation I cannot be on these medications forever I put my ego aside and told my doctor I have a problem and he has been very supportive and helped me in a weaning/ taper dose using diazepam on a staged dispense meaning I get X amount of tablets per week on a schedule to slowly and safely come back to being benzo free 
Starting off on a very high dose of 12x 5mg tablets if Diaz per day (I’m now down to 1x 5mg per day!) I am feeling great and can’t wait to finally be off this crap! 
When I was at 6tabs daily I missed an appointment with my doctor. When I spoke to my doctor next he said “since you’ve been without it for a week let’s try take you off it but if you get stuck give me a call” I agreed and lasted another 4 days before making an emergency appointment and REALLY needed to keep on the taper to which my doctor refused. Another 3/4 days later I wasnt leaving my bed! I had gotten up to make a coffee to wake myself up a bit to try push myself. while pouring boiling water into the cup I had a Jolt followed by a seizure I woke up covered in burns from the boiling water with my family freaking out over the top of me (this is not a good feeling!) I went to the hospital having Tics and uncontrollable muscle movements all the way there. after looking into my case and treating my burns the ED doctors quickly gave me 10mg of diazepam which within half an hour completely stopped my withdrawals, spasms and uncontrolled body movements. This could all have been prevented if my doctor had continued the wean! I don’t like pointing fingers my doctor is very thorough, but! In what world does it make sense to take someone from 30mg daily to zero! 90% of people who have taken benzos for years cannot stop abruptly because of the dangers of seizures. Results from this hospital trip were to re start wean and see a neurologist.
When I went to the neurologist appointment she asked me a few questions about family history which is ZERO and when have I ever had any other seizures which is ONLY when I have abruptly stopped benzodiazepines after a long period of high daily doses 
The neurologist has an opinion that “I have a life long epilepsy disorder which cannot be cured but there are medications for it” she stated I have “probably been unknowingly treating my epilepsy with benzos for the past 3/4 years” I get that benzos are a if not THE best anti seizure medication there is as in terms of duration/onset and ability or efficacy of stopping seizure activity In the brain but if that was the case then how come the only times I have ever had seizures are right after abruptly stopping benzos. I have no family history or any personal history ever if seizures? 
 I am 24 and had my first seizure at 23 plus another this year in February. 
I am a nurse, I live an active healthy life style (other than the benzo addiction which I have dealt with! It’s been a long road but I am finally nearly safely off benzos and seizure free since February.

Fellow Bears,

As a UC Berkeley Public Health alumnus and current medical student, I feel compelled to share my doctoral dissertation on the most distinguished venues for answering nature's most pressing calls on campus. This isn't merely about finding a porcelain throne – it's about the holistic convergence of gastrointestinal wellness, architectural aesthetics, and mindful meditation.

Through years of rigorous field research and peer-reviewed personal experiences, I've developed a sophisticated framework for evaluating these sacred spaces. My methodology considers crucial variables such as ambient lighting, acoustic privacy (essential for those morning coffee aftermath scenarios), and the elusive 'zen factor' that transforms a mere bathroom break into a transcendent experience.

As any seasoned public health professional knows, the choice of one's daily constitutional venue can significantly impact both physiological and psychological well-being. The right environment can turn a mundane biological necessity into a moment of scholarly reflection or pre-exam meditation.

Let me share my evidence-based findings...ranked accordingly to the evidence-based, aforementioned framework.

**(1) Pimentel Hall** **(1/10) - A Case Study in Architectural Antipathy**

Location: Basement Level, Lower Sproul Plaza 

Named after: Distinguished chemist George C. Pimentel 

Year Built: 1963

Ah, Pimentel Hall – or ""The Pits"" as it's affectionately known by generations of traumatized OChem students. While this brutalist monument to scientific achievement houses one of Berkeley's largest lecture halls and has witnessed countless Nobel laureates' lectures, its bathroom facilities seem to have been designed by someone who clearly had a vendetta against basic human comfort.

The bathroom in question, accessible via a suspiciously dim stairwell that would make Edgar Allan Poe uncomfortable, resides in what can only be described as the building's forgotten catacombs. The facilities appear to have last been updated when Lyndon B. Johnson was president, offering visitors a authentic historical experience of mid-60s plumbing technology.

Notable Features:

* Temperature regulation that alternates between ""Viking Winter"" and ""Sahara Afternoon""
* Acoustic properties that turn every flush into a building-wide announcement
* Vintage graffiti featuring OChem reaction mechanisms from desperate students
* A persistent mysterious drip that has outlasted several department chairs

While the building itself has hosted groundbreaking discoveries in spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, the bathroom appears to be conducting its own long-term experiment in human endurance. The only redeeming quality is that the perpetual sense of despair perfectly matches one's mood after a particularly brutal chemistry midterm.

Pro tip: Best visited during Nobel Laureate lectures when the entire student body is trapped upstairs pretending to understand quantum mechanics.

Sustainability Rating: 1/10 - The only sustainable thing here is the sustained feeling of regret.

**(2) Valley Life Science Building (VLSB) (2/10) - Where Dreams of Med School Go to Die**

Location: Valley Life Sciences Building, 

Lower Campus Built: 1930 

Primary Clientele: Hopeful pre-meds, before organic chemistry crushes their souls

Ah, VLSB – where the T-Rex skeleton in the lobby serves as a haunting reminder that some things are better left extinct, much like these bathrooms. While the building itself stands as a testament to scientific achievement, housing everything from preserved specimens to cutting-edge research facilities, its bathrooms appear to have been designed by the set decorator of ""Children of Men"" during a particularly nihilistic phase.

The stark contrast is almost poetic: above, you have the prestigious Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory gazing down upon VLSB like a disappointed parent, while below, these bathrooms offer an experience that makes the dystopian facilities in ""District 13"" look like the Ritz-Carlton. The ambiance perfectly captures that moment in ""Blade Runner 2049"" when K descends into the ruins of Las Vegas – except instead of irradiated orange hues, you're treated to flickering fluorescent lights and mysterious drips that would make even a microbiologist nervous.

Notable Features:

* A peculiar aroma that has likely evolved into a new life form
* Lighting fixtures that flicker in Morse code, spelling out ""abandon hope""
* Mysterious stains that could be the subject of several PhD dissertations
* Acoustic properties that make every sound echo like you're in the ""Inception"" dream levels

The true irony lies in the fact that while students upstairs study the miracle of life and evolution, the bathrooms seem stuck in a parallel universe where sanitation never made it past the Mesozoic era. The proximity to the dinosaur exhibits feels less like an educational display and more like a warning about the state of the facilities.

Pro tip: Like the protagonists in ""The Maze Runner,"" your best strategy is to run – preferably to literally any other building on campus.

Scientific Value: 9/10 

Actual Usability: 2/10 

Evolutionary Progress: -3/10

Warning: Exposure may result in a sudden understanding of why those dinosaurs went extinct.

**(3) Wheeler Hall** **(3/10) - A Neoclassical Nightmare**

Location: Central Campus, adjacent to hallowed ground where dreams of Stanford acceptance letters go to die 

Architectural Style: Classical Revival (1917) 

Named after: Benjamin Ide Wheeler, who clearly never used these facilities

Ah, Wheeler Hall – that magnificent testament to Berkeley's architectural ambitions, where the ghosts of rejected English dissertations roam the corridors and freshmen practice pronouncing 'Foucault' incorrectly. While its marble-clad exterior whispers sweet nothings of academic prestige, the bathrooms tell a different, more pungent tale.

The facilities present a stunning dichotomy: pristine white tiles that appear to have been designed by someone whose only brief was ""make it feel like walking into a supernova."" The blinding luminescence serves the dual purpose of highlighting every questionable stain while simultaneously searing one's retinas – perhaps a metaphor for the illuminating yet painful process of academic enlightenment.

Notable Features:

* Lighting bright enough to be visible from the International Space Station
* An acoustic design that turns every flush into a dramatic reading of ""The Waste Land""
* A persistent medieval bestiary of insects that would make an entomologist weep
* That one particular stall on the 2nd floor, now famous for its resident arachnid who's probably earned tenure by now

The perpetual sewer bouquet provides a humbling reminder that beneath our sophisticated veneer of literary theory and cultural criticism, we are all still mere mortals. The spider's web above the large stall serves as both a security system and a poignant reminder of the web of interconnected narratives we study in comparative literature.

Pro tip: Best visited between Victorian Literature seminars, when one can truly appreciate the Gothic horror of it all.

Historical Significance: 8/10 

Actual Functionality: 2/10 

Spider Companionship: 10/10

Warning: The blinding white interior may cause temporary existential crises and spontaneous recitations of T.S. Eliot.

**(4) Evans Hall** **(4/10) - The Concrete Confessional**

Location: Northeast campus, looming ominously like a bureaucrat's fever dream 

Built: 1971 Architectural Style: Brutalist (emphasis on 'brutal') 

Primary Inhabitants: Data Scientists pretending they're not just CS majors who couldn't get into CS61A

Ah, Evans Hall – Berkeley's beloved tribute to East German prison architecture. This towering concrete monstrosity stands as a testament to what happens when architects decide that windows are merely a bourgeois construct. While Stanford's computer science department enjoys their Silicon Valley-inspired glass palaces, Berkeley's data scientists toil away in what appears to be a building designed by someone who mistook ""1984"" for an architectural handbook.

The bathrooms, however, exist in a peculiar state of quantum mediocrity – neither notably horrific nor particularly praiseworthy. Like a C+ grade in CS61A, they're just... there. In a building where students contemplate the existential dread of linear algebra and probability theory, these facilities offer a surprisingly neutral refuge from the windowless rooms where dreams of tech internships go to die.

Notable Features:

* Water pressure that follows a perfect normal distribution
* Toilet paper holders that could be used as examples in STATS 101
* A view of absolutely nothing, maintaining the building's commitment to sensory deprivation
* Hand dryers that sound like they're computing Bitcoin on the side

The true irony lies in the fact that while students upstairs crunch numbers to predict the future, the bathrooms remain stuck in a perpetual 1970s time loop. Perhaps this is what the ""mid"" in EECS stands for.

Pro tip: Best visited during the golden hour when the concrete walls cast shadows that make you question whether you're in a bathroom or a modern art installation about institutional conformity.

Structural Integrity: π/10 

Soviet Nostalgia Factor: 9/10 

Data Science Street Cred: sudo/10

Warning: Extended exposure may result in developing an unhealthy appreciation for concrete and a compulsive need to analyze the statistical distribution of toilet paper usage.

**(5) Latimer Hall** **(5/10) - The McDonald's Drive-Thru of Campus Relief**

Location: Chemistry Complex, where dreams of medical school meet reality 

Built: 1963 

Named after: Wendell Mitchell Latimer, who probably had a private bathroom

Ah, Latimer Hall – the express lane of campus bathrooms, where efficiency meets minimalism in a space roughly the size of a reaction vessel. Like the chemistry department's version of a New York City micro-apartment, these facilities embody the principle that size doesn't matter (a lie we tell undergrads about their OChem reaction yields).

This bathroom facility, much like a fast-food value meal, provides exactly what you'd expect: nothing more, nothing less. It's the bathroom equivalent of ""good enough"" – much like that lab report you submitted at 11:59 PM. The space management here is so efficient it would make Marie Kondo proud, though it's unclear if anything here sparks joy.

Notable Features:

* A footprint smaller than a grad student's stipend
* Acoustics that broadcast your presence to every passing GSI
* A sink positioned with the precision of a titration experiment
* That distinct smell of desperation and hydrocarbons

The true charm lies in its role as the preferred alternative to Pimentel's basement horror show – much like how students prefer literally any other career path after their first semester of OChem. It's the bathroom equivalent of settling for your safety school: not your first choice, but hey, at least you got in.

Pro tip: Best utilized between the hours of 2:15-2:45 PM when most GSIs are busy crushing undergrads' hopes in office hours.

Efficiency Rating: 8/10 Size-to-Usage Ratio: 3/10 GSI Encounter Probability: 0.457 ± 0.023

Warning: May encounter bitter graduate students muttering about failed columns and rejected manuscripts. Avoid eye contact and back away slowly while showing your lab notebook as a sign of submission.

**(6) Dormitory Bathrooms  -- The Great Residential Divide: A Tale of Two Bathrooms**

**Blackwell Hall (8/10) - The Bourgeois Paradise**  
Location: Wherever the sun actually shines in Berkeley  
Built: 2018, when someone finally remembered students need housing

Behold, Blackwell Hall – Berkeley's monument to social stratification, where the chosen ones reside in their gleaming tower of modern amenities. The bathrooms here aren't just facilities; they're spa-like sanctuaries where privileged students can contemplate their good fortune while sitting on porcelain thrones that probably cost more than a semester's worth of textbooks. The water pressure is so perfect, it makes even Stanford students jealous.

Notable Features:

* Motion-sensor everything, because touching things is for peasants
* Lighting that makes everyone look Instagram-ready
* Actually functional ventilation (revolutionary concept)
* Mirrors that don't make you question your life choices

**Unit 3 (2/10) - The Proletariat's Purgatory**  
Location: The shadowy realm where hope goes to die  
Built: Sometime between the Gold Rush and the Summer of Love

Ah, Unit 3 – the living testament to Berkeley's commitment to ""character building."" Where the bathroom becomes a thrilling game of ""Guess What That Smell Is"" and ""Why Is The Floor Always Wet?"" The gender-inclusive facilities would be progressive if they weren't also inclusive to various forms of fungi and bacterial colonies conducting their own independent research projects.

Notable Features:

* Shower drains that double as unauthorized toilets
* A mysterious symphony of 3 AM sounds that would intrigue paranormal investigators
* Water pressure that alternates between ""gentle mist"" and ""fire hose""
* An ecosystem diverse enough to qualify as a biology field study site

The Nocturnal Experience:

* 2:00 AM: Mysterious sobbing (probably OChem related)
* 2:30 AM: Someone practicing their kazoo
* 3:00 AM: The ghost of failed midterms past
* 4:00 AM: That one person who decides to take a shower while practicing opera

Real-life survival tips:

* Always wear shower shoes (consider hazmat boots)
* Don't ask about the strange noises
* Pray for seismic activity to end your suffering
* Remember: what doesn't kill you makes you more qualified for grad school

Wealth Gap Rating: Wider than the Berkeley Hills  
Cultural Experience: Marx would write a sequel  
Earthquake Preparedness: Please, just one small tremor

Warning: Extended exposure to Unit 3 facilities may result in developing a superhuman immune system or a deep understanding of class warfare – possibly both.

**(7) The Libraries' Hidden Chambers (6/10) - Where Knowledge Meets Nature's Call**

Location: Scattered throughout campus like ancient wisdom  
Focus: Moffitt Library & Free Speech Movement Café Area  
Primary Clientele: Sleep-deprived students and coffee-fueled academic hermits

Ah, the library bathrooms – where intellectual discourse meets intestinal discourse. These sacred chambers, particularly those near FSM Café, offer a uniquely Berkeley experience: the chance to simultaneously relieve yourself while overhearing the complete psychological breakdown of a CS major or the passionate whispered rant of a political science student questioning capitalism.

**The Moffitt Experience**  
Picture this: You're seeking refuge in these tiled confessionals, when suddenly you become an unwitting therapist to the adjacent stall's occupant, who's softly crying about their Medieval Studies midterm while simultaneously ordering their third cold brew of the day. It's group therapy, but with dividers.

Notable Features:

* Exceptional acoustic properties for eavesdropping on academic crises
* Toilet paper that's somehow simultaneously single-ply yet pretentious
* The persistent aroma of FSM's coffee mixed with eau de anxiety
* Graffiti that ranges from quantum physics equations to existential poetry

Perfect for:

* Introverts seeking the parasocial comfort of others' academic despair
* Students needing material for their psychology papers
* Anyone wanting to hear unfiltered opinions about professors
* Those seeking the authentic college experience of crying in a bathroom

Pro tip: Peak drama hours occur during midterms and finals, when the bathrooms transform into confessionals for academic sins.

Privacy Rating: 4/10 (walls have ears)  
Entertainment Value: 8/10  
Therapeutic Potential: 7/10  
Coffee Proximity: 9/10

Warning: May accidentally become involved in someone's emotional breakthrough or spontaneous study group formation. Side effects include developing a pavlovian response to the sound of coffee grinders.

**(8) Stanley Hall** (8.5/10) - The Enlightened Throne

Location: Northwest campus, where bioengineering dreams take flight 

Built: 2007 

Primary Clientele: Distinguished professors who've forgotten where they parked their Teslas and grad students pretending they belong

Ah, Stanley Hall – the gleaming jewel in Berkeley's STEM crown, where the bathrooms are as pristine as the building's grant funding. While lesser facilities across campus struggle with basic functionality, Stanley's restrooms achieve a zen-like state of perfection that makes one question if they're still on a public university campus at all.

Perched majestically on the slope leading to the hallowed grounds of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stanley Hall's facilities offer what can only be described as a spa-like experience for the academically enlightened. Here, one can contemplate the mysteries of protein folding or rehearse their Nobel acceptance speech in blessed solitude.

Notable Features:

* Pristine cleanliness that would impress a clean room technician
* Lighting that actually flatters instead of fluorescent-flickering your soul into submission
* Acoustic properties perfect for practicing your ""I just got published in Nature"" victory speech
* Water pressure consistent enough to be worthy of a PhD thesis

The true luxury lies in the silence. No mysterious pipes groaning like a failed experiment, no echoing sounds of academic despair – just the peaceful serenity of a bathroom that actually believes in your research potential.

Pro tip: Best visited during faculty meetings when the building's inhabitants are elsewhere debating the future of science

Cleanliness Rating: NIH funding/10 Meditation Potential: 9.5/10 Impostor Syndrome Reduction: 7/10

Warning: Extended use may make returning to lesser campus facilities emotionally challenging. May also result in unrealistic expectations for all future bathroom experiences.

**(9) Dwinelle Hall (9/10) - The Labyrinth's Hidden Oasis**

Location: Somewhere in the space-time continuum of Central Campus  
Architectural Style: M.C. Escher meets Kafka  
Built: In multiple dimensions simultaneously

Behold, the greatest plot twist in Berkeley's bathroom saga – Dwinelle Hall, where students enter seeking classrooms and exit questioning reality itself, somehow houses the campus's most surprisingly sublime sanctuaries. Like finding a five-star spa inside a quantum physics experiment, these facilities defy all expectations and possibly several laws of nature.

You'd think a building infamous for its non-Euclidean geometry and ability to make seniors cry would host bathrooms that match its chaotic energy. And yet, like a secret garden in a concrete maze, Dwinelle's restrooms stand as monuments to civil engineering done right.

Notable Features:

* Sensor-equipped sinks that dispense actually warm water (a miracle by UC standards)
* Pristine cleanliness that suggests a portal to an alternate dimension
* Gender-inclusive facilities that welcome all who've managed to find them
* A peaceful atmosphere that makes you forget you're in Berkeley's architectural fever dream

The true irony lies in the journey: while students spend hours lost in Dwinelle's twisted corridors trying to find their Comparative Literature seminar, those who stumble upon these bathrooms find themselves reluctant to leave. It's as if the building's chaos exists purely to protect these sacred spaces.

Pro tip: The challenge isn't finding a clean bathroom in Dwinelle – it's finding your way back to it once you've discovered it. Some say there's a bathroom so perfect it appears only to those who've given up hope of ever finding their classroom.

Navigation Difficulty: √-1/10  
Actual Facility Quality: 9/10  
Spiritual Enlightenment: 10/10  
Probability of Finding It Again: 3.14159/10

Warning: May result in developing Stockholm Syndrome with a building. Some visitors report emerging from Dwinelle bathrooms to find themselves in different academic years or parallel universes where their classes were actually scheduled in Evans Hall.



**CONCLUSION:** Fellow Bears, as we conclude this comprehensive analysis of Berkeley's finest (and most horrifying) facilities, let us remember the ancient medical wisdom passed down through generations of doctors: *""The bowels are the window to the soul, but a clean bathroom is the door to sanity.""* \- Hippocrates (probably)

As both a medical student and a Berkeley survivor, I can confidently say that the quality of one's daily constitutional directly correlates with academic performance. Just as every great physician must know their anatomy, every wise Berkeley student must know their bathroom geography.

From the blinding white abyss of Wheeler to the post-apocalyptic landscape of VLSB, from the proletariat porcelain of Unit 3 to the bourgeois brilliance of Blackwell, each facility tells a story. But perhaps the greatest lesson lies in Dwinelle Hall, where against all odds and architectural logic, paradise exists within chaos. It stands as a testament to that old medical school adage: *""The best bathroom is not the closest one, but the one worth walking to.""*

Remember, dear colleagues, in the words of my attending physician: *""Just as we must be selective with our diagnoses, we must be selective with our digestive sanctuaries.""* Choose wisely, for your GPA – and your gut – may depend on it.

Final Rankings and Diagnoses:

* Terminal Case: Pimentel Hall (2/10)
* Chronic Condition: VLSB (2/10)
* Stable but Guarded: Wheeler Hall (3/10)
* Showing Signs of Life: Evans Hall (4/10)
* Ready for Discharge: Latimer Hall (5/10)
* Fully Recovered: Stanley Hall (8.5/10)
* Miracle of Modern Medicine: Dwinelle Hall (9/10)

Prescriptive Advice: When in doubt, hold it and hike to Stanley or Dwinelle. Your future self will thank you for the exercise and the excellence.

Here in the west, most specifically America, we become a custom to isolating ourselves. Everyone is stressed out, angry, rushed, and we’ve become immune to it. It’s just a normal way of life. Then you go to Thailand. Everyone is friendly, it doesn’t matter where you go, someone wants to strike up a conversation with you, There’s so many available women to go around, that dudes are high-fiving each other and getting along and there’s no competition.

Everyone is friendly, and eager to engage with you. Go to any pub, any grill, any bar, any venue and it don’t matter who sits down next to you? They’ll strike up a conversation with you and it’s a friendly one. You don’t see that much anymore in the United States. Everyone keeps to themselves. It’s like a step back in time. Then there’s the slight seediness of the place. The alleyways, the endless shops and places to eat, the smell in the air, or the food vendors etc. I would get up every morning and go to a little mama pop coffee shop. And crack jokes with the old lady who owned the place. She would give me a hug and a big smile. And was happy to see me as I was her. You don’t get that at Starbucks in America. You spend a few weeks over there and if you’re lucky a month like I did. You come back home and it hits you. You realize it got into your blood. A few weeks and start missing it. And thinking about it more and more.

The Thai culture may not have got everything perfect but I’ll tell you what when it comes to knowing how to live and smile and socialize, they definitely got that 100% right. The place taps into how humans were originally meant to interact with each other. Friendly, engaging, the women feminine, and accommodating, not all trying to share the same five men. Treat the women with respect and a touch of kindness and you’ll get 100 fold back. The mentality is what can they do for you? Not the other way around like it is in America. 

I don’t know about the rest of you, but I’m going back to that place as fast as I can. And as often as I can.  ",3,1733192555.0,EverythingPattaya,0,1.0,False
1h5ctop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandalsResorts/comments/1h5ctop/pregnant_and_going_to_ochi_here_are_some_tips/,Pregnant and going to Ochi? Here are some tips.,"I was to preface this with the fact that we had a wonderful time overall! But I wish I would have known a few things before going. Also - if some things seem obvious, please be kind as this is my first pregnancy. This was also my first time at a Sandals. 

Let’s start with the positives! All the Sandals staff were extremely hospitable to the fact that I am pregnant and had trouble with stairs/food aversions/swelling feet. They went above and beyond to make sure that I was as comfortable as possible. One of the gift shops even gave us a dolphin plushie for free! They seemed genuinely excited to chitchat about their families and genuinely interested with our growing family. I was expecting some recognition as a pregnant person, but not service to this extent! 

They had no qualms about bringing me a different dish if one didn’t sit well (my aversions are not predictable - usually the food sounded amazing on the menu and when it arrived, my stomach just said “NOPE!”) and they were always amazing and never made me feel bad even though I hate wasting food. 

On top of that, it was the rainy season and the few times where I was going up/down stairs without my husband near me, very quickly would a staff member offer their arm or hand to  make sure I made it to the end of the staircase safely. 

Now the “negatives” - which is really just things I wish I would have known before and one real negative that Sandals did make right. 

THE STAIRS. Holy cow. There are so many stairs and elevators are not available everywhere. The building we stayed in had only two elevators that could comfortably fit two people but often people would squeeze 3-4 in. The last two days, one of those elevators were out of service and that was a pain but nothing that anyone could do about. I brought only a couple pairs of socks for our travel days and assumed I’d be in sandals the rest of the time but had to wash socks to wear my sneakers just to survive the stairs. 

The other odd thing is that there are a ton of bees. I’m not sure if this is a seasonal issue or not but it was just.. strange? They never stung anyone from what I could tell but I don’t especially care for bugs so that kind of made me uneasy. Since the lobbies are wide open, the bees tended to hang out at the coffee/tea stations. 

Part of our plan was my husband was going to do a scuba dive and I’d go to the spa and do the “mother to be” massage. We waited too long and my husband wasn’t able to book his dive but I had mentioned to one of the spa ladies that I might be interested in it and they did not let up even after I told them that I had changed my mind. 

Now the one true negative. There is an excursion company that is a separate company from Sandals. When we realized that the dive/spa plan wasn’t going to work out, we asked the woman at the desk if there was anything safe for me to do while pregnant. She of course offered a shopping tour, which really isn’t our cup of tea. Instead we hired a taxi to go get some local food (this was wonderful!) and then she also recommended Mystic Mountain. We should have looked it up before paying. It was $92/person and while I couldn’t do most of the rides (zip line, bobsled, roller coaster), she said there was a butterfly/hummingbird aviary and beautiful views for me while my husband did those rides. Sounded great to me! I don’t mind sitting out while he has the experiences and it would have been a nice way to get off the resort for a few hours. When we arrived, we were informed that we only had entry and my husband would not be able to ride any of the rides - okay, not great but we’d enjoy the aviary and views together… we were directed to the aviary and it was just a bench next to a couple of hummingbird feeders. The whole area was smaller than our room at the resort. The music was super loud so there was no way we’d even get a peak at and of those little creatures. There was also the scent of something that must have died in the woods nearby which did not help my nausea. We did walk around and enjoy the views. They do also have a pool we could have got in but there were a ton of kids in it playing - which is exactly what it’s for! But not great for relaxing. It just isn’t a great spot for a pregnant person. By the time we were done exploring, we still had two hours before our bus returned. It was disappointing since we paid nearly $200. My husband spoke with the woman at the excursion desk and she offered us a 20% refund. When we were leaving, the Sandals front desk manager asked us how everything was, so we mentioned it and they comped the whole excursion without question. We were not expecting anything at all. 

The only reason I bring this up is to hopefully save another pregnant person from the same mistake. 

I want to reiterate that we had a wonderful time overall! This is just from my perspective as a pregnant person! ",1,1733192471.0,SandalsResorts,0,1.0,False

Tea: White2Tea Machines of Loving Grace 2024 shou (7g mini)

Brewed at 100C, 100ml gaiwan, 2 rinses, 5-10s steeps.

Aroma had a bit of wodui but by the second wash that was mostly gone. Wet leaf aroma had a lot going on, some stonefruit notes and a bit of generic herbal, but the dominant one was butter and butterscotch. Never had this experience with a shou, it smelled like butterscotch candy with a tiny bit of browned butter on the back end. The liquor was much more mild. Developed into a more bready yeasty note as time went on.

Flavor on the first steeps was very earthy, with a slight almost coffee-like bitterness. Noticeable cooling effect in the mouth but no distinct menthol notes like Lumber Slut has. Still a very smooth tea with a nice mouthfeel, and the earthy notes are very deep and evolving. Smoothed out quite a bit in later steeps into a very balanced shou, lots of very subtle notes.

Overall this is a really nice shou, very well balanced and lots of subtle flavors. At this age and price I probably wouldn’t buy a cake, but I think some age would make this a really unique shou.",5,1733192370.0,puer,0,1.0,False

It's like the universe's way of balancing things out—where one love story ends, another can begin, preferably with me. So there I was today, sipping my espresso, scanning the room for anyone who might need a friendly ear or a shoulder to lean on.

That's when I noticed this young guy, probably a 3L law student, lugging around a stack of papers that looked thicker than a phone book. He seemed nervous, fidgeting with his tie and shuffling his notes. Behind him walked a seasoned lawyer, oozing confidence and clearly unfazed by whatever was about to go down in the courtroom.

Curiosity got the better of me, so I decided to sit in on their case. Maybe one of the clients was a newly single woman open to some light conversation afterward. The case was over a modest $10k divorce—nothing that would normally grab headlines. The experienced lawyer looked almost bored, while the 3L acted like he was about to argue in front of the Supreme Court.

The kid handed over this massive 45-page brief, packed with block quotes and citations from unpublished opinions. Even I, with my limited legal knowledge, knew that wasn't standard procedure for such a minor case. The judge raised an eyebrow but remained patient, probably remembering his own early days.

As the proceedings continued, it was clear the 3L was in over his head. He started to argue with the judge—a bold move for someone who hasn't even passed the bar yet. The seasoned lawyer just leaned back, a slight smirk on his face, waiting for the inevitable conclusion.

Meanwhile, I couldn't help but feel a mix of second-hand embarrassment and opportunity. The courtroom had a few attendees, including a woman who seemed particularly stressed—perhaps the client or a relative. She might appreciate a kind word after witnessing this less-than-stellar performance.

The judge gently corrected the 3L, suggesting he revisit some fundamentals and perhaps consider an appeal if he felt so inclined. The kid looked deflated, his ego taking a visible hit. The case wrapped up quickly after that, the seasoned lawyer gathering his things and likely already thinking about his next big client.

As everyone started to disperse, I saw my chance. I approached the woman I'd noticed earlier. ""Tough day in court, huh?"" I offered with a sympathetic smile.

She sighed, ""You have no idea.""

""Sometimes it's helpful to decompress over a cup of coffee,"" I suggested. ""My treat?""

She looked at me for a moment, perhaps weighing the offer. Then she nodded. ""You know what, that sounds nice.""

And just like that, a door opened. Divorce court might be the end of the road for some, but for me, it's a place full of new beginnings. After all, every ending is just a new opportunity waiting to unfold.",0,1733192333.0,LawSchool,5,0.42,False

I have a 5 year old long haired domestic cat (F, neutered, NOT declawed). I noticed lately that she’s been running from me and running under tables lately when I attempt to pet her. She likes to have her belly rubbed and often lays on her back and presents her belly to people for a rub. Well my roommate and I were in the kitchen this evening when she showed her belly, so I went over and attempted to rub her belly. She immediately ran off under one of the coffee tables, so I’m guessing she wanted my roommate to rub her belly and not me…… :( she still comes and lays in bed with me for a few minutes 1-3 times throughout the night, which is normal behavior for her, but won’t let me pet her.

Edited to add: literally right after I posted this, she hopped up in bed with me, sprawled out on her side, and let me rub her face and belly. 🤨 

Another edit: I heard a few minutes after she left my room that she went by my roommate and laid on her back and let him rub her belly. What the heck!!!!

1h5coy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1h5coy6/ive_had_two_appointments_and_only_10_minutes_of/,I've had two appointments and only 10 minutes of discussion. Why did this happen and what can I do?,"I (36M) had one of the worst experiences and I am not sure what to do about it. I had two neurology appointments and was seen for 10 minutes each time. 5 minutes allocated to a physical test he administered during both appointments. So 5 minutes of actual discussion for each appointment. I dont know why I deserve such dismissive behavior. Whether it was something that I did or it has to do with the type of insurance I have. I am just trying to figure out what I am supposed to do next. I hope you all can provide some guidance. 

**SYMPTOMS**

I obtained a referral to a neurologist for tremors that began a year or so ago. They only occur when moving a muscle, not at rest. They effect every muscle in my body. The tremors happened overnight and were accompanied by several other symptoms, notably a complete change in my mental health. I have zero motivation, extreme executive dysfunction, memory loss. I am completely disorganized. Its like my ADHD was dialed to 11. My adderall has lost its effectiveness overnight. Coffee no longer works. It feels like something happened to my brain and I am trying to figure out if the tremors are related to it. Additionally, I have weight loss and loss of appetite that has began over the last few months so I am not sure if that is related. It seems like my body is falling apart.

**BACKSTORY**

My appointment was booked 3 months out. On the day of the appointment I was a bit late due to getting blocked in while trying to park in their lot, so I had to park a half mile away. As a result I was only able to see the doctor for about 10 minutes which is totally understandable, my fault. He performed a quick test but nothing really stood out to him. He said the tremors were likely due to my thyroid (I had a few thryroid tests the following week) and told me to come back for a follow up after I get my thyroid testing done. They book me out another 3 months.

During the second appointment, he starts with the same test as last time and sees nothing conclusive. We rule out the thyroid since the tests came back fine so I ask him what else it could be. He mentions that my heart rate is high again (see edit) and that the tremors are likely due to my adderall use. I tell him that I dont believe that is the case since I have been on it for over 15 years and no one has ever brought up my heart rate until now. I also inform him that I have discontinued my adderall use several times and the tremors remained unchanged. I even tell him that I did not take adderall for 6 months at the beginning of this year and still had the tremors but he doesnt really say anything. I then mention that I met with a neurologist a year ago and they had asked me to get an MRI but due to having to move home for a bit and changing insurances, I never followed up on it. He tells me that they did not request an MRI (im guessing he can see my records) and says he doesnt think that I need one. I know for a fact they requested one because I remember talking with insurance about payment for it. Why would he say this? I bring this up and he says fine, I will send in a request but they rarely get approved by insurance. 

At this point he seems standoffish and dismissive. He starts to pack up some of his things and I continue explaining some symptoms that I find relevant. I tell him that the tremors get worse when my heart rate is elevated. For example, during intense exercise or a high stress moment when playing a video game. He says ""yeah, heart rate, its probably the adderall"", with a smirk. At this point he is standing up and starting to walk out. Keep in mind, I have only been there for 10 minutes, 5 of which were part of the physical test. I was so shocked that I just let it happen. No discussion was had on potential causes for my symptoms. I received zero guidance. He barely asked me any questions. He just stood up, said lets follow up in 3 months and walked out. No goodbye, no next steps, nothing. I dont even have any comments or an after visit summary in my portal.

Is it normal to only be seen for 10 minutes for this sort of thing? I dont know if it was something I did (see edit) or perhaps he just thinks its not that serious? Maybe it has to do with my medicaid insurance? I have to wait months in between appointments just to be seen for 10 minutes? I just feel completely defeated. These tremors just appeared overnight, along with several other symptoms. Like something triggered them. I had to quit my job because of them! Which is also why I am on medicaid. I am just devastated that whats happening to me is serious enough to cause me to quit my job yet I only get 10 minutes of his time. 

I dont know what to do. I want to complain but I am not sure what good that will do. I was also thinking that I could maybe send him a message in the portal explaining how serious this is and provide as much information as I can. Maybe he will understand? I guess another option is to find someone else but I would likely have to wait another 3 months. This is a total nightmare.

Edit: On the first appointment, he mentioned that my heart rate was high. This is the first time I have been told this so I just chalked it up to me having to run to the office due to getting stuck in the parking lot. During the second appointment (arrived on time), he brings my heart rate up again. I tell him I had to run to the office again since I got the cancellation call just an hour ago and had to park far away. Perhaps he just thinks I am abusing adderall or something due to the running? Maybe he thinks im just making excuses? This is honestly the only thing I can think of that could explain the dismissive behavior, other than maybe the insurance.",1,1733192076.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Music is easily the most important part of my life. I spend hours and hours listening to different bands and what not. I prefer metalcore/ hardcore but I listen to ""almost"" anything. From HIM, Clutch and Viking Skull to Whitechapel, No Cure, Spite and Full of Hell. I also play guitar so having a wide range of music helps with writing.

If you're interested in the same genre of music as myself, that's a massive plus for me and I'll probably talk your ear off about it


Video games also take up a lot of my time. A good session on CS2 or Destiny with the boys is a great way to spend my nights. Talking shit, making jokes and laughing until l'm crying.


I'm pretty introverted but I do enjoy getting out and having coffee or beers with my friends as often as I can just to keep myself occupied.


Again, my apologies if this was all over the place or very inconsistent. I'm quiet and nerdy and don't like writing about myself.
If anything l've said peaks your interest, feel free to send me a chat. I'll answer as often as I can.

We chatted normally and, as soon as I asked, they didn't reply, even though they had seen the message. However, when we meet, they still talk to me face to face as normal, as if nothing had happened. And I have to stop myself from asking, ""Why did you ignore me on this day and now you're here talking to me normally?""

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1h5cbe0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1h5cbe0/how_best_to_refocus_on_myself/,How best to re-focus on myself?,"I recently ended a 6.5 year relationship about a month ago. The last thing I expected was to end up having a crush on someone. This guy seemed genuinely interested in me. Said things like ""I really wish we had more time talk to each other,"" and when I suggested we hang out, he agreed and suggested coffee. When we spoke on the phone, which we did pretty often at first because we were working together on a project, he even said he wondered if he was meant to meet me. It wasn't in an overtly romantic way, but definitely enough to inspire that kind of thought. He took time to ask me many kinds of questions about me/who I am. He showed genuine interest, truly seemed to want to listen to what I had to say. 

It wasn't until after I slept with him one night that I began to realize I definitely misread the situation. He has been super kind to me, but I feel honestly stupid that I didn't realize all that happened between us was nothing more than a one night stand for him, and he had no intentions of anything else. He is just a nice person in general, a person who is just generally interested in other people. 

I feel a bit embarrassed (and slightly pathetic) that my own long term relationship had gotten so bad that someone treating me with common decency and a basic amount of attention was enough for me to think it was a ""catch feelings"" type situation. I feel a bit used, not necessarily by any fault of his, not having realized all of this until I visited him a few days later and he politely explained his perspective on everything, which included him stating he all but regretted sleeping with me (i.e., ""I don't regret it, but...""). 

None of this was said in a mean or rude way. Again, it was all very genuine and real, and even though it did hurt my feelings, it wasn't malevolent, just matter of fact and up front. But I'm so confused why I didn't see that BEFORE I shared something so intimate with another person. I let myself be really vulnerable. That isn't necessarily bad. I just don't want to waste my energy on this kind of situation for no reason. I ultimately am searching for a loving, respectful, long term relationship in life even if not right here right now.

But on top of all this, I really should be focusing on myself after ending such a serious relationship so recently. In many ways I am doing just that--I am living on my own, focusing on spending time with myself, reading my books, studying French, spending time with my friends, working on forming new friendships, etc. However, I get straight up annoying and nagging thoughts about this guy. I don't see any future with him, the signals have become more and more clear, but at least I know I learned something from the situation, and perhaps it was a good distraction to help me close the door on my past relationship and get a glimpse of other possibilities out there for me.

I can't help but wish for a relationship with someone that could make me feel the way I felt around him during the brief encounters we had. My fantasy is just a loving, caring relationship with mutual respect, but that feels very unattainable in a sort of depressing way. At the same time I am also really enjoying living alone/reconnecting with myself and don't want that to end anytime soon. 

What are my next steps to re-focus on myself from this accidental distraction that keeps taking up real estate in my mind? This guy is not the one for me--after realizing I wasn't being taken seriously as a sincere potential partner by him, I lost pretty much any desire to pursue something with him. I'm not really attracted to someone who does not have space for me. So why can't I stop thinking about him? How do I move on and re-focus?",1,1733190984.0,AskWomenOver30,0,1.0,False

When the battlefield changes, they falter. Regulations shift, new rules emerge, and their momentum fades. Kendu Inu, a memecoin cult, thrives because its strength comes not from external conditions but from its unshakable community. This community works relentlessly for the coin, no matter the regulatory landscape, forging a path of innovation and dedication.

They’ve launched Kendu energy drinks, Kendu coffee, and an NFT marketplace, building real-world and digital utility that keeps the coin relevant. Completing 50,000 votes for a free Certik audit further proves their discipline and unity, elevating Kendu Inu’s credibility.

But Kendu Inu doesn’t stop there. The Ethereum-based token is set to bridge to Solana and Base blockchains, expanding its reach to a wider market and more diverse user base. This strategic move unlocks new liquidity, growth potential, and cross-chain adoption, positioning the token as a force across multiple ecosystems.

At a market cap of about 25 million, the exponential gains possible far outpace those of utility tokens constrained by regulations or outdated use cases. Utility coins can be surpassed by newer, more efficient alternatives, but Kendu Inu’s foundation in community, creativity, and adaptability ensures its momentum only grows. This is a coin driven by purpose, not by permission.

[Caffeine](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition/caffeine-and-sleep#:~:text=Caffeine%20promotes%20wakefulness%20by%20blocking,to%20ensu) is a stimulant and 1-2 cups of coffee per day can interfere with sleep and can stay in your system for up to 24 hours. It interrupts [adenosine](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/adenosine-and-sleep), a chemical in the body that helps you fall asleep and maintain deep sleep. Goal is to limit to 1-2 cups of coffee or caffeinated beverages per day or if possible, eliminate altogether. This is especially important in people who may be very sensitive to the effects of caffeine.

A good rule of thumb is to avoid all caffeinated drinks including tea and certain sports drinks at least 10 hours before bedtime or if you sleep at night no caffeine after noontime. Also, remember caffeine is found in [chocolate](https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-caffeine-in-chocolate-8383422) in cocoa solids with dark, bittersweet, and semi-sweet having the most. In fact, 3.5 ounces of dark chocolate can have as much as 50-150 mg (maximal) of caffeine comparable to 8 oz cup of coffee with 80-100 mg. Not to worry, as 1.5 ounces of milk chocolate has only 9 mg of caffeine and white chocolate has none.

1h5c12h,https://i.redd.it/be95pgw1gj4e1.jpeg,The one that didn't quite get away...,"This will be a rather lengthy post because, well, if you're like me, you enjoy a good story and because I enjoy telling a good story and hunting stories are some of the best stories...
I hunt from the ground these days and I've lost all of my private land access except for one archery only area.
So, I'm limited to public land here in Rhode Island. I've met some really nice folks over the years that I only see during hunting season because we frequent certain WMAs. I'm on a first name basis with several guys, and we have each other's cell numbers so that we can stay in touch. We frequently contact  each other to see where the other is planning to go in order to stay out of each other's way or to capilize on their presence. Anyway,  that's what you need to know in order to understand how the story unfolds. 
A gorgeous November morning temps in the high thirties and the sun was just beginning to reach the treetops behind me. I was perched on the crest of a steep hillside looking over a flat strip of land that extended roughly 150 yards to my left and then dropped again. To my right, the land sloped more gently from the high ground behind me, to the flat strip below. 
The woods were a mix of tall, white pines which dominated the area and a few mixed hardwoods sprinkled here and there. Everything was perfect. I was cozy in my tossed together ground blnd, sitting comfortably in my ""Hammock Seat"" that I'd strapped to what was left of an old dead white pine. My view was as good as it gets in these New England woods. Perfect...
Today however, was to be the day of almosts and that's OK with me because  for me, almost scoring is almost as good as scoring because it's all the excitement with none of the work. Of course, I'm the guy who hooks into a monster fish only to have it shake loose right at the boat and instead of throwing a tantrum, I spin around to face my friends with a look of astonishment on my face and yell "" DID YOU FREEKIN' SEE THAT!!!??? "".
As long as I get my adrenaline fix I'm more than satisfied, I'm downright happy.
It was somewhere around seven am when I spotted the doe down below and making her way along the flat strip just the way it had played out in my mind over and over as I sipped my coffee and scanned the area. 
Now, I've been doing this for three decades. I know better than to do what I was about to do, but that adrenaline was already coursing through my veins and I was on autopilot. I waited for the doe to step behind one of those giant white pines and I made my move. I needed to get a better look at her. I'd already made my mind up that I wasn't going to fill my antlerless tag unless it was a BIG doe. I never took my eyes off of that tree when I made my stupid mistake. I rose to my feet because I knew that there was just enough time for me to steady my muzzleloader on a small beech tree that was one step away and ensure a good shot should I decide to shoot. 
Well, in my thirty plus years of whitetail hunting I've learned tons about deer, and one of the first things that I learned about deer is that does often travel in groups. Yup. For some reason, I never thought about that simple fact before I rose and took that step, but I immediately realized my mistake when two unseen white tails shot up and then all three white tails waved goodbye as they bounded across the flat, over the crest and out of sight. 
""Damn! That was stupid."" I muttered under my breath, but my heart was pounding and that familiar euphoric feeling settled in and all was good in the world. I settled back into my seat and resumed slowly scanning my surroundings as the rush slowly subsided.
It was a little after eight when I was startled by the unmistakable sound of a deer snort. One, single, very loud and very close blow. I instinctively spun my head toward the sound behind my right shoulder just in time to see my fourth white tail of the morning waving goodbye, only this time there were antlers. The buck stopped and turned to look at me at a distance of roughly sixty yards. I was pegged down. No way I could raise my rifle. He was locked right on me. I sat motionless staring back at him for thirty seconds or so. There was ample time to size him up. He was a very respectable Rhode Island eight point. Small body with a rather proportionally large rack. I made the decision to take him if I was somehow able to pull it off. He wasn't about to give me that opportunity however, and down the slope, across the flat and over the crest he went waving that big ole' white flag like he was taunting me. I was still basking in my second hit of adrenaline of the morning when a shot rang out from about three hundred yards away in the direction that the buck had been headed. I waited a few and texted another hunter who'd seen a decent buck a couple of days before. I knew he was planning on returning, but I didn't know when. There were no other vehicles in the parking area when I arrived, but someone else was definitely in the woods now.
""Mark, are you hunting this morning?""

A minute or so later, his reply.

""Yes. I think you pushed him to me.""

I'd done no such thing. That buck decided to run to Mark all by himself. I was just the guy who got him running in the first place. 
I gathered my things and took a short walk to where Mark was and heard his side of the story. Evidently, that buck wasn't finished running when he passed in front of Mark at mach three. Mark tried twice to stop him with a ""mouth bleat"", but that buck wasn't hearing it. Mark dropped him on the run at forty yards. 
Ya' know how I said all of the excitement and none of the work...? Yeah, well, I couldn't let Mark, who's still recovering from a near deadly fall this past summer, and his hunting partner, Lenny, drag that buck alone. I walked the half mile back to the truck while they dressed the deer and dragged it to the trail. I returned with my cart and the three of us traded turns pulling Mark's prize, the one that didn't quite get away, back to his truck.

1h5bz94,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1h5bz94/female_abuser/,Female Abuser,"This is a long and isn't even the half of it and i'm not going to explain all that i found out for the world to know but...

 My cheating ex consistently exhibited this pattern of behavior. After five months of dating, she abruptly withdrew all affection and intimacy that once came so naturally. I picked up on it very quickly and became anxious, blaming myself and questioning what I had done wrong for her demeanor and attitude towards me to change. This caused her anxiety to skyrocket, but initially, she kept reassuring me I had done nothing wrong, urging me not to overthink or worry. 

Little did I know, this was all because she had cheated on me, but she ran with my anxiety and self-blaming because it was easier than telling me the truth and because it probably made it hard to find the ""right time"" to tell me.. i could tell around this time (which i later found out was right after she cheated) her anxiety and guilt was eating her alive. 

Soon after out of what seemed like no where, she began insisting on “needing space to recharge” I thought this was strange because she always went out of her way to see me and always wanted to be around me, and was usually the initiator of affection and intimacy but i'm not controlling so i didn't question it.. at least at first... 

but i came to find out and know this was bullshit; in reality, my presence had become a mirror reflecting her own shame and guilt. She needed distance from feeling like the betraying, cheating manipulator she had become. As my anxiety raised due to her pulling away all intimacy and affection towards me, he guilt and shame also intensified, and so did her “need for space”. Eventually, me being that mirror she hated to look at.. she grew resentful towards me, picking fights for no reason, emasculating me, and seeming annoyed by my mere presence. I was simply trying to recapture the person I had fallen in love with, the partner who had been so effortlessly present at the beginning.

I increasingly questioned her “need for space” as things never added up. Multiple red flags emerged: sketchy situations, warnings from others about her activities, and things that simply didn’t make sense. Despite these warning signs, I struggled to trust my instincts. The more her guilt weighed her down, the more anxious I became. This vicious cycle led to greater distance between us, culminating in her decision to disregard me in  pursuit of other relationships behind my back to get her needs met, that she no longer cared to get met by me. Also neglecting my needs, and giving me empty false promises for change in her pulling away and avoidance. 
She disregarded all my cries for help and signaling... she probably didn't care, she never asked me or brought anything up to me in a non judgmental way. The most she would do is tell me things i should and shouldn't be doing.

Beyond having multiple family issues going on at the time and personal struggles, i was doing my best to work through, that were clearly having an effect on my mental health... she just added to it with the anxiety I experienced from her betrayal, cheating and lies, knowing something was off and wrong but not knowing what it was, and being manipulated for ever catching on to things or questioning her... 

and she  just watched as I deteriorated with anxiety into a shell of myself for 4 months. She blatantly lied, manipulated, and blame-shifted anytime I threatened her double life, employing manipulation tactics to cover up her cheating, lying, and betrayal without a care for the severe trauma, anxiety, and depression she was inflicting upon me.

Her excuses became increasingly elaborate: claiming to be at the mall, at a friends house trying on clothes, hiking, getting coffee with friends, at the gym, “needing a night to recharge,” or working late. In reality, she was on the other side of town getting fucked  CONSTANTLY throughout our relationship, from 8 PM to 3 AM all the time. By the same guy she was snap chating and texting how much she loved him all throughout our relationship and was flying to visit right before and into the beginning of our relationship. 

When I questioned her weird excuses for not wanting to see me and always ""needing space"".. she would employ DARVO tactics to manipulate me and carry out her clandestine plans. She accused me of not respecting her boundaries or work schedule (Of course using these as the excuse because if i questioned anything around them, i seemed insensitive) whenever I simply wanted to see her, making me feel like the villain for wanting to spend time with my own girlfriend, despite seeing each other only three times a week at most.

As I began to alter my routine and catch her off guard, her stories became increasingly convoluted. I strategically switched up my usual patterns, catching her unprepared. I’d wait until I was nearly at her house before announcing my arrival for planned visits, to which she’d invariably claim she’d be home in 15 minutes (both times of course). On other occasions, I’d stay late at her place during my lunch break instead of returning to work as usual. Her reaction to finding me still there was telling – she appeared surprised, scared, and anxious, even insisting I leave so she could spend time with an out-of-town “friend.” Later, I discovered this “friend” was the dude she was getting fucked by.

Whenever she sensed my discomfort with her flimsy excuses, she’d send lengthy, apologetic messages. Suddenly, she’d overcompensate by making plans and going out of her way to see me – behaviors she only exhibited when feeling guilty or suspecting I was onto her deception. This pattern of sudden desire to spend time together was clearly driven by her shame and fear of discovery.

The facade began to crumble when I threatened to disrupt her plans by saying i was coming over unexpectedly.
One night, she claimed to be working late due to a coworker’s illness – an unusual detail for her to share, considering she always (or so i thought) worked late. I texted her around 8:30 PM, asking to see her after work, I wanted to be around who was supposed to be my support (I was dealing with distressing news i discovered about my late father’s death). 
An hour passed without response. I texted again, saying i know she was working but to just respond when she got a chance, because I was nearby her house and could come over when she finished work. Another hour of silence followed.
At 10:30 PM, I messaged that I was just going to  head over to be there when she got off so we could relax and watch a movie or something.

Immediately, she FaceTimed me, appearing anxious and frantic. Suddenly, she wasn’t working but driving – a stark contrast to her radio silence just minutes earlier acting like she was ""working late"" and Before I could speak, she launched into a tirade, accusing me of disrespecting her boundaries and making me feel terrible for simply wanting to see her. Defeated, I said I wouldn’t come over, which likely relieved her as she’d nearly been caught and i ruined her plans to go cheat on me once again.
Later, I uncovered proof that she’d clocked out at 8:59 PM, long before our call. she wouldn't have even called or responded if i didn't say i was heading over.
Moreover, she wasn’t wearing the work dress she’d claimed two days prior was her only option due to other approved outfits being unavailable.
In the aftermath, she continued to shift blame, employ DARVO tactics, and gaslight me. When I directly asked if she was cheating, she provided only a vague, evasive answer and quickly changed the subject, further cementing my suspicions.

The next day, she transformed into an unrecognizable person, emotionally detached and suppressing all emotions, with every wall and defense mechanism in place. She blindsided me with a breakup over the phone. With her mind made up and with no discussion about it.. other than blaming me for all our issues and of all my shortcomings and how i fell short of meeting her needs and who she expected me to be,  and all that i wasn't and how i wasn't enough for her...and then using my mental health struggles against me by throwing them in my face for why I wasn't capable. She demanded no contact and abandoned me when I needed her most, leaving me confused, heartbroken, and blindsided without a logical explanation. Trying to control the narrative before I ended up catching her in the act or finding out anything. She was in too deep, and blindsiding me as quickly as possible was her only option.. other than telling the truth.

During those two weeks, I uncovered an overwhelming amount of concrete evidence proving her infidelity. Most of this proof I’ve kept to myself, even to this day. Hoping for honesty and explanation, I approached her with a few minor, easily admissible instances. I genuinely wanted to understand her motivations and the reasons behind her prolonged deception. However, she responded with blatant lies, even when confronted about it.  

Frustrated by her dishonesty, I sent her a screenshot with proof of her own messages and interactions as evidence. Yet, she persisted in lying, even in the face of irrefutable proof. When I presented a second piece of evidence clearly exposing her lies, she resorted to evasion and deflection, refusing to offer any explanation or acknowledge the truth. Throughout our exchange, she contradicted herself multiple times, essentially admitting to her deceit without directly confessing.
Unable to maintain her web of lies, she ultimately chose to block me on all platforms, severing all communication. 

Five months have passed, and I’ve heard nothing from her. Meanwhile, she’s been actively gaslighting me and tarnishing my reputation among our mutual friends, dragging my name through the mud in an attempt to control the narrative and deflect from her own misdeeds.

This female abuser literally took a part of me I will never get back. I will never be the same person again. She stole away my innocence, the love I shared and wore on my sleeve, and the light I always had in my eyes is gone now. I move differently, and everyone around me has noticed. She killed my once great sense of humor, and diminished all focus and my motivation, which were some of  my most admirable traits. Through her Manipulation, Gaslighting and deceit – even in the face of irrefutable evidence – she sought to protect her tarnished reputation and self-image at a devastating cost to my mental and physical health, all in a desperate attempt to maintain the false narrative that she hadn’t cheated on me, despite knowing full well what she had done.

I possess a wealth of evidence that could easily expose her infidelity to everyone, detailing who, when, and where her cheating occurred. Yet, I choose not to air her dirty laundry or further damage her reputation. 

She must live with the weight of her actions, knowing she betrayed someone who genuinely loved her and did nothing to deserve such treatment. Her loss of control over the narrative she fabricated is a consequence of her own deceit.

She may continue to lie, manipulate, and avoid accountability. She can gaslight and suppress the truth, attempting to “black out” her misdeeds as she does with everything else. She might seek distraction in short-term relationships and casual encounters with various partners.
However, the truth has a way of surfacing; lies have no solid foundation and inevitably crumble. the truth always rises. A lie has no foundation to stand on. But Karma is MY bitch, and she’s coming back for revenge to settle out the score. believe that. 
At least I don't have to carry that weight on my shoulders. She has to go to sleep every night knowing all she did to someone who didn't do anything to deserve it, or be treated like that. I gave everything I could to try the best partner I could, and as soon as I wasn't my absolute best. Instead of having a partner who could help support me through it and be there for me, I got a partner who Betrayed me behind my back, disrespected me to my face, used my struggles against me as ammo and threw them back in my face and emasculated me, used her presence and absence as a weapon, And abandoned me in time I needed her, and got manipulated and lied to, given no apology much less even an honest explanation for very clear and simple evidence she refused to take accountability for just to hold up a lie and to try to uphold any kind of false self-image she has of herself. She has to look in the mirror knowing she destroyed someone and caused deliberate pain to someone who loved her, for no reason other than to keep the truth her and I both know, from surfacing.

In reality, she was on the other side of town getting fucked  CONSTANTLY throughout our relationship, from 8 PM to 3 AM all the time. By the same guy she was snap chating and texting how much she loved him all throughout our relationship and was flying to visit right before and into the beginning of our relationship. 

When I questioned her weird excuses for not wanting to see me and always ""needing space"".. she would employ DARVO tactics to manipulate me and carry out her clandestine plans. She accused me of not respecting her boundaries or work schedule (Of course using these as the excuse because if i questioned anything around them, i seemed insensitive) whenever I simply wanted to see her, making me feel like the villain for wanting to spend time with my own girlfriend, despite seeing each other only three times a week at most.

As I began to alter my routine and catch her off guard, her stories became increasingly convoluted. I strategically switched up my usual patterns, catching her unprepared. I’d wait until I was nearly at her house before announcing my arrival for planned visits, to which she’d invariably claim she’d be home in 15 minutes (both times of course). On other occasions, I’d stay late at her place during my lunch break instead of returning to work as usual. Her reaction to finding me still there was telling – she appeared surprised, scared, and anxious, even insisting I leave so she could spend time with an out-of-town “friend.” Later, I discovered this “friend” was the dude she was getting fucked by.

Whenever she sensed my discomfort with her flimsy excuses, she’d send lengthy, apologetic messages. Suddenly, she’d overcompensate by making plans and going out of her way to see me – behaviors she only exhibited when feeling guilty or suspecting I was onto her deception. This pattern of sudden desire to spend time together was clearly driven by her shame and fear of discovery.

The facade began to crumble when I threatened to disrupt her plans by saying i was coming over unexpectedly.
One night, she claimed to be working late due to a coworker’s illness – an unusual detail for her to share, considering she always (or so i thought) worked late. I texted her around 8:30 PM, asking to see her after work, I wanted to be around who was supposed to be my support (I was dealing with distressing news i discovered about my late father’s death). 
An hour passed without response. I texted again, saying i know she was working but to just respond when she got a chance, because I was nearby her house and could come over when she finished work. Another hour of silence followed.
At 10:30 PM, I messaged that I was just going to  head over to be there when she got off so we could relax and watch a movie or something.

Immediately, she FaceTimed me, appearing anxious and frantic. Suddenly, she wasn’t working but driving – a stark contrast to her radio silence just minutes earlier acting like she was ""working late"" and Before I could speak, she launched into a tirade, accusing me of disrespecting her boundaries and making me feel terrible for simply wanting to see her. Defeated, I said I wouldn’t come over, which likely relieved her as she’d nearly been caught and i ruined her plans to go cheat on me once again.
Later, I uncovered proof that she’d clocked out at 8:59 PM, long before our call. she wouldn't have even called or responded if i didn't say i was heading over.
Moreover, she wasn’t wearing the work dress she’d claimed two days prior was her only option due to other approved outfits being unavailable.
In the aftermath, she continued to shift blame, employ DARVO tactics, and gaslight me. When I directly asked if she was cheating, she provided only a vague, evasive answer and quickly changed the subject, further cementing my suspicions.

The next day, she transformed into an unrecognizable person, emotionally detached and suppressing all emotions, with every wall and defense mechanism in place. She blindsided me with a breakup over the phone. With her mind made up and with no discussion about it.. other than blaming me for all our issues and of all my shortcomings and how i fell short of meeting her needs and who she expected me to be,  and all that i wasn't and how i wasn't enough for her...and then using my mental health struggles against me by throwing them in my face for why I wasn't capable. She demanded no contact and abandoned me when I needed her most, leaving me confused, heartbroken, and blindsided without a logical explanation. Trying to control the narrative before I ended up catching her in the act or finding out anything. She was in too deep, and blindsiding me as quickly as possible was her only option.. other than telling the truth.

During those two weeks, I uncovered an overwhelming amount of concrete evidence proving her infidelity. Most of this proof I’ve kept to myself, even to this day. Hoping for honesty and explanation, I approached her with a few minor, easily admissible instances. I genuinely wanted to understand her motivations and the reasons behind her prolonged deception. However, she responded with blatant lies, even when confronted about it.  

Frustrated by her dishonesty, I sent her a screenshot with proof of her own messages and interactions as evidence. Yet, she persisted in lying, even in the face of irrefutable proof. When I presented a second piece of evidence clearly exposing her lies, she resorted to evasion and deflection, refusing to offer any explanation or acknowledge the truth. Throughout our exchange, she contradicted herself multiple times, essentially admitting to her deceit without directly confessing.
Unable to maintain her web of lies, she ultimately chose to block me on all platforms, severing all communication. 

Five months have passed, and I’ve heard nothing from her. Meanwhile, she’s been actively gaslighting me and tarnishing my reputation among our mutual friends, dragging my name through the mud in an attempt to control the narrative and deflect from her own misdeeds.

This female abuser literally took a part of me I will never get back. I will never be the same person again. She stole away my innocence, the love I shared and wore on my sleeve, and the light I always had in my eyes is gone now. I move differently, and everyone around me has noticed. She killed my once great sense of humor, and diminished all focus and my motivation, which were some of  my most admirable traits. Through her Manipulation, Gaslighting and deceit – even in the face of irrefutable evidence – she sought to protect her tarnished reputation and self-image at a devastating cost to my mental and physical health, all in a desperate attempt to maintain the false narrative that she hadn’t cheated on me, despite knowing full well what she had done.

I possess a wealth of evidence that could easily expose her infidelity to everyone, detailing who, when, and where her cheating occurred. Yet, I choose not to air her dirty laundry or further damage her reputation. 

She must live with the weight of her actions, knowing she betrayed someone who genuinely loved her and did nothing to deserve such treatment. Her loss of control over the narrative she fabricated is a consequence of her own deceit.

She may continue to lie, manipulate, and avoid accountability. She can gaslight and suppress the truth, attempting to “black out” her misdeeds as she does with everything else. She might seek distraction in short-term relationships and casual encounters with various partners.
However, the truth has a way of surfacing; lies have no solid foundation and inevitably crumble. the truth always rises. A lie has no foundation to stand on. But Karma is MY bitch, and she’s coming back for revenge to settle out the score. believe that. 
At least I don't have to carry that weight on my shoulders. She has to go to sleep every night knowing all she did to someone who didn't do anything to deserve it, or be treated like that. I gave everything I could to try the best partner I could, and as soon as I wasn't my absolute best. Instead of having a partner who could help support me through it and be there for me, I got a partner who Betrayed me behind my back, disrespected me to my face, used my struggles against me as ammo and threw them back in my face and emasculated me, used her presence and absence as a weapon, And abandoned me in time I needed her, and got manipulated and lied to, given no apology much less even an honest explanation for very clear and simple evidence she refused to take accountability for just to hold up a lie and to try to uphold any kind of false self-image she has of herself. She has to look in the mirror knowing she destroyed someone and caused deliberate pain to someone who loved her, for no reason other than to keep the truth her and I both know, from surfacing.

 My cheating ex consistently exhibited this pattern of behavior. After five months of dating, she abruptly withdrew all affection and intimacy that once came so naturally. I picked up on it very quickly and became anxious, blaming myself and questioning what I had done wrong for her demeanor and attitude towards me to change. This caused her anxiety to skyrocket, but initially, she kept reassuring me I had done nothing wrong, urging me not to overthink or worry. 

Little did I know, this was all because she had cheated on me, but she ran with my anxiety and self-blaming because it was easier than telling me the truth and because it probably made it hard to find the ""right time"" to tell me.. i could tell around this time (which i later found out was right after she cheated) her anxiety and guilt was eating her alive. 

Soon after out of what seemed like no where, she began insisting on “needing space to recharge” I thought this was strange because she always went out of her way to see me and always wanted to be around me, and was usually the initiator of affection and intimacy but i'm not controlling so i didn't question it.. at least at first... 

but i came to find out and know this was bullshit; in reality, my presence had become a mirror reflecting her own shame and guilt. She needed distance from feeling like the betraying, cheating manipulator she had become. As my anxiety raised due to her pulling away all intimacy and affection towards me, he guilt and shame also intensified, and so did her “need for space”. Eventually, me being that mirror she hated to look at.. she grew resentful towards me, picking fights for no reason, emasculating me, and seeming annoyed by my mere presence. I was simply trying to recapture the person I had fallen in love with, the partner who had been so effortlessly present at the beginning.

I increasingly questioned her “need for space” as things never added up. Multiple red flags emerged: sketchy situations, warnings from others about her activities, and things that simply didn’t make sense. Despite these warning signs, I struggled to trust my instincts. The more her guilt weighed her down, the more anxious I became. This vicious cycle led to greater distance between us, culminating in her decision to disregard me in  pursuit of other relationships behind my back to get her needs met, that she no longer cared to get met by me. Also neglecting my needs, and giving me empty false promises for change in her pulling away and avoidance. 
She disregarded all my cries for help and signaling... she probably didn't care, she never asked me or brought anything up to me in a non judgmental way. The most she would do is tell me things i should and shouldn't be doing.

Beyond having multiple family issues going on at the time and personal struggles, i was doing my best to work through, that were clearly having an effect on my mental health... she just added to it with the anxiety I experienced from her betrayal, cheating and lies, knowing something was off and wrong but not knowing what it was, and being manipulated for ever catching on to things or questioning her... 

and she  just watched as I deteriorated with anxiety into a shell of myself for 4 months. She blatantly lied, manipulated, and blame-shifted anytime I threatened her double life, employing manipulation tactics to cover up her cheating, lying, and betrayal without a care for the severe trauma, anxiety, and depression she was inflicting upon me.

During winter months my coffee consumption increases to almost 5-6 cups a day, with only the first two being caffeinated coffee and the rest being decaffeinated. 

I am always hunting for good decaffeinated coffees. 

Just ordered Finca El Paraiso from Hydrangea. However my previous experience with Hydrangea says the coffee maybe a bit too funky. I lean more towards classical coffee profiles. 

Anything else you guys recommend?

1h5btt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1h5btt9/new_to_epilepsy_concerned_sister/,"New to Epilepsy, concerned sister.  ","Hi guys,

This past weekend I was with my sister (29 F) when she experienced her first and second seizure ever (within 5 hours of each other), my first experience with it as well. I am very concerned and would appreciate any support and or advice when it comes to lifestyle choices, habits, and preventive action you and others take. I added my in-depth observations that I created for medical team below.

I am trying to make sense of this all and be there in whatever way I can, its been an overwhelming experience.

Night before: 

* Shared two bottles of wine
* Ate a nutritious meal of fish, beans, rice, etc. 

Morning observations:

* Had  6 hours of sleep, was up in the middle of the night. 
* Pilates at 9:00 AM 
* Brunch at 11:00,  banana bread, avocado toast, and 1 cup of coffee 

Upcoming week:

* Anticipating a stressful work week. 

General Life changes:

* loss of two cats of 15 years 
* Newer Job that’s been a hard transition
* Has been anticipating a 1-2 month long travel.
* Small internal bleeding from a car accident in 2020-- was written off as minor and not to be concered.

Seizure 1: 

Possibly an aura:

Sister asked me if I was ok out of the blue.

1. Staring and not responsive began to stutter “wha wha what”
2. Froze with hands in front
3. Body stiffened, me and another person placed her on side with a coat for her head to rest on. 
4. Drooling
5. Foaming 
6. Grunting 
7. No tongue biting.

Active symptoms stopped in a solid 2 minutes. 

1. Body relaxed and she opened her eyes but did not seem to acknowledge my face.
2. Just looking around, body was calm 
3. Wanted to curl up and rest.

*My thought \*Possibly a tonic-clonic seizure?\**

Total time was about 8 ish minutes from climax to a more relaxed state of episode when ambulance arrived.

Her observation: 

Before:

* remembers stuttering 
* Remembers me starting to notice seizure

After:

* very cold 
* Shaking 
* Slow to responding/ silent 
* Was not speaking clearly to first responders in the beginning. 

Seizure 2: 

1. Standing in front of hospital holding phone. 
2. Began to stutter “wha wha wha” 
3. Froze with hand on her lips.
4. Laid her immediately on the sidewalk.
5. Eyes closed 
6. Mouth clenched 
7. Kept her on the side, no crazy movement. 
8. Grunting a little 
9. Body was not stiff

Much shorter seizure, lasted about 30 seconds- 1 minute. 

Her Observations:

Before:

* Remembers stuttering 
* Remembers pressing the Uber request 

After: 

* minor headache at temples 
* Sore neck - maybe from clenching? 
* Body temperature is comfortable 
* Fatigued 

Taken back to the hospital where neurologists confirmed epilepsy— will start Keppra immediately.

EEG scan was normal 
Blood work normal
MRI showed impact from car accident. 
Looking to schedule a neurologist asap 

Lifestyle symptoms:

* Stressed from work.
* Anxious (apartment dissatisfaction and craving more community from friends) 
* Nervous tick- touches bottom lip then top lip with hand or presses fingers together. 
* Drinks about 2 bottles of wine weekly. 
* Weekend average: sometimes has a binge-like night with roommate. Probably twice a month.
* Not sleeping incredibly well, 3-4 nights per week sleeping 6 hours. 
* IUD- close to the expiration of it, appointment made to remove.

I also think my depression has come back to bite a bit, as I am generally quite low mood and find everything less interesting/am more spiteful. 

So today, I go for a run, cook big meals for the rest of the week, go for a coffee (been anxious too) and go to the gym! On top of that, I did a fair amount of uni work, although I did make a mistake that cost me some time. 

Regardless of achieving all I set out to do (and had felt anxious about the previous day), I feel like I haven’t achieved much, or done anything worthy of feeling satisfied. Plainly, I feel shit. 

My assessments are due mid January, and I have little to no interest in any of them; one module I have done something more advanced in my own time, another I have self studied in the summer and progressed in my own time, and the third just does not interest me. I am aware I have signs of ADHD, and so I know that interest motivates me, so I thought maybe that is why I don’t feel so good after today? Or for the last 1.5 months?

I am spending most of my time doing stuff I just plain don’t care about, and have to force myself to do any of it. Would this affect my satisfaction in productiveness?

1h5bk0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1h5bk0a/srpower/,SR=POWER,"That is what Ive come to realize after close to 5 months of SR. SR gives you a power over women, men and yourself. You become more lucid, you can think more clearly, you can see through other people masks and insecurities more easily.  You can almost read other people's mind. You also become more self aware and you know what you have to do or not do, to benefit yourself.  It gives you that power because it removes or reduce your own insecurities that were blinding you. You no longer seek to control others or invalidate them because you realize that is an actual weakness.

What you care about is more about yourself, understanding yourself and being more introspective. You start to slowly exerting control on yourself and taking yourself to where you need to go. Its a process that takes time. It also gives you power to exert strong boundaries should anyone try to attack you, physically or psychologically. You become thirsty of learning more and even creating more. You initiate actions and do and say whatever you want with no hesitation, but react less to others BS unless they are really attacking yourself.

While you no longer seek to control the external world, you will find that you are having more and more influence. Having control and having influence are 2 opposites. Control is forced, coerced and manipulative and will only work on weak toxic people, you try to impose your will on others and take from them. Influence is the opposite and can work on anyone. Someone influential is the giver, not the taker, but he chooses carefully who to give to. When you have influence, people decides from their own will to go towards you and give to you. They trust you and they value you.

Men and women will start doing all kind of things you maybe never had before. They will seek your attention, call you by your name, shake your hand. Some people will buy you things or coffee/drinks for no reason. Women will come talk to you from their own will. Some will even try to seduce you. Many might fight between them for your attention. Some will ask you for advices.

That is what a leader really is, its one who is chosen by others but if you become one or want to be one, you have to ackownledge that you are one. If you are one, you have responsabilities on yourself and others. You gotta be good to those that deserves it, ignore the ones who are useless and toxic to you and defend your boundaries against any attacks from weaker and jealous people. And more than anything, you gotta be good on yourself and do, say and take whatever you want if you think its morally ethical.

And do not ever give your seed to a weak insecure woman that will drain you, no matter how hot she might be. Give it to a woman that will be good to you, elevate you and give you more power. A good and strong woman will want to give a lot of power to her man because she sees he can use it wisely and will not abuse it.

SR does not fix your problems, it removes certain of your insecurities like shame and allow you to think more clearly and understand others and yourself better. It shows you the way you need to take. It reveils the deeper layers of reality that lies underneath the superficial illusive world most people live into. You become indifferent to people's social status and other people perceptions of yourself. Your perception of yourself and others is the one that matters.

The child loves looking at colors and it was requested to use fish printed fabric, so I was wondering whether I would use a full backing in another print or if I should try out a new pattern for the backside of the quilt. 

I found this pattern called “one fish two fish” by cozy quilt patterns. I decided to purchase the pattern and have a go at it. 

I took a small coffee break to look at the ocean and relax for a couple of hours (photo included) and am now working on adding the sashing. (Scroll to the end to see the real life inspiration for this project).

I love to spend the day on the beach, especially go in the crystal clear water and sometimes I get to see fish schooling in certain areas so I was inspired to take on this project. It will be a twin bed sized quilt when it’s all done.

I’ve visited several high-end cafés in Colombo like Coffee Stop, Sweet Lab, The LAB, and others, but honestly, I’ve been quite disappointed with their menus. Where’s the exclusivity? The same iced coffee you can make at home often tastes worse in these places. For instance, I tried a Boba Iced Coffee at Cinnamon Grand recently, and the boba pearls were so poorly done—like rice grains—that I couldn’t continue drinking it. Paying LKR 2000 for that felt like such a waste.

However, just yesterday, I visited a café called Milk and Honey, and it was a completely different experience. For the first time, I truly sensed exclusivity. They had unique options like organic Blueberry Milk, Cinnamon Milk, and more. The flavors were distinct, and the experience felt worth the price.

What are your thoughts on luxury cafés in Sri Lanka? Have you noticed a lack of uniqueness in some, or have you come across places that truly stand out? Would love to hear your opinions!

That just happened and I realized how fuck up it is. 

To clarify, I'm a student and I'm doing well (third year of five) but I can't get a job and my parents aren't well off. 

I pay a lot of my stuff with my saving money and I rarely ask them for money because I feel guilty about it. 

I never buy fun stuff, always food or rent. And even by doing so, sometime I skip food. 

So here is the vent part, I'm not a English speaker so I will try my best. 

Having no money is the pinacle of why this society is horrible. No money = no hobbies = less interaction with other =bad health = depression. I love to cook, and I'm a good cook. 

Going groceries shopping is for me a stab in the hearth. ""wow this piece of meat looks stunning I bet with good spicy..."" "" 16€"" ""ah that's my budget for this week too bad guess I'll go back to eating eggs"". 

""oh man do you want to come up to this party it's only 7 € for entry and the beer is at 2€"" "" 'ah man I' ve got stuff to do ( lying because 9€ is 9€)"" 

Money doesn't by happiness? I can't remember the last time I bought myself a treat. I'm sick and tired of this and I'm only 21!
I realize more and more now that I will have to chase money allllll my fucking life. 
I love my parents to the death, they tried their best but they just got the worst luck. And I will fight anyone who says they are lazy. 
My mom got health issues that put her off work (and frankly with how toxic it was, if it wasn't for her health she would have had an hearth attack). 
My dad (a farmer) just had crisis after sickness after crisis. 
I know that I'm lucky to have a home and parents and studies and all but for the love of me I've never been this close from a mental breakdown. In 6 month I've lost 7 kilos! 

I think I'm depressed because of it. 

Now I'm alone in my bed crying because tomorrow morning I can have a coffee and bread. Yeayy.

1h5b6jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1h5b6jk/a_beautiful_catholic_girl_told_me_to_stop_saying/,A beautiful catholic girl told me to stop saying “regard” because it wasn’t kind and now I feel embarrassed ,"I met this girl at a friend’s party and we ended up talking the entire party. A couple days later I texted her asking if she’d want to grab a coffee and hang out. Once we got together she brought up how she had just come from church and I asked her about it and she’s actually been a devout Catholic her entire life. 

Listening to her talk, I couldn’t help but admire how pretty she was, her polite mannerisms, how educated she was on many subjects. She had both this attractive maturity and ability to be playful and clever. She expressed such strong convictions for her religion while also maintaining this soft openness. I found myself admiring both her inner and outer beauty and could feel my heart beat faster when we held eye contact

We started going on long walks together and just sharing stories of our childhood. I felt so good making her laugh and at one point she rested against me in a movie we saw and I could’ve died in that moment with how amazing it felt to feel the weight of her body against mine. 

We were crossing the street and I found the courage to hold her hand and we continued to hold hands even after crossing. It was true bliss. I was then telling her a story about an old boss of mine and I got so carried away that I exclaimed “haha he’s such a fucking regard!!!” And she stopped walking and looked truly hurt. She then said “I’m sorry…. I really don’t like that word. My brother has a mental handicap and he was always called that. It’s really not a kind word to use…I don’t mean to lecture you.” and I just kind of stood there and apologized and she assured me that it was okay “you’re a sweet guy… it’s just a hateful word. I’m sorry” but I could see she was truly wounded by me using it

The moment was so lost and awkward and I felt a true embarrassment. We kind of let go of our hands at that point and maybe hung out for another 30 minutes. She eventually went home but even the hug goodbye felt already distant. I will never say regard to a beautiful girl ever again
