1o5fthw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1o5fthw/how_to_overcome_chest_tightness/,How to overcome chest tightness,"I have had chest tightness for around 3 months now. Consistently everyday. Especially in the morning. My anxiety has transformed into a depression and I am currently taking time off work to try and recover. 

So far my strategy has been to do nothing and only things that I enjoy. Take each day as it comes. Try to eat well etc. I have began to meditate, exercise and also see a psychiatrist and psychologist once every two weeks. 

My medication includes Oxazepam and sertraline. I have recently switched to sertraline as the previous antidepressant had no affect. 

The only things that are helping are the exercise, walking, oxazepam, cooking and talking. I’ve also stopped drinking coffee. 

Still after around 3/4 weeks I am still waking up with this absurd chest tightness to the extent I am taking deep breaths to try and relieve it. 

I wanted to hear from the community if some of you have had a similar experience and if you’ve found other ways to try and overcome this. As my mood improves and I am more and more energized, more like myself, this chest stuff continues. 

I’ve also had all the medical tests to rule out anything physical which came back clean.

1o5ftfr,https://v.redd.it/93w2jfrjtuuf1,Ninja luxe cafe 601/701EU leaking,"A few weeks ago, I bought the 601EU model. The coffee was great and I was happy with it, but after a few days, I noticed it was leaking water onto the table. At first, I thought the tray was overflowing — but it wasn’t. So, I decided to return the machine and get the 701EU, hoping that the more expensive version wouldn’t have the same issue. Unfortunately, I was wrong 😂 It started leaking after the third shot.

Two weeks into this adventure, I’ve decided to switch to a different brand (still deciding which one).

I’m in the EU, and this is just a heads-up for others here: maybe wait until they fix these issues, or go for something else.

It’s a shame, because I really liked the machine otherwise.",1,1760350487.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,0,1.0,False

1o5fpzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1o5fpzo/dog_eat_dog_chapter_7/,Dog Eat Dog [Chapter 7],"When I came to, I was lying in bed. My head throbbed something furious, and my limbs were like jelly. It felt like I hadn’t slept in weeks. As if I were submerged in the swamp again. Sounds muffled, vision bleary, not a rational thought in sight.



Slowly, I sat up in bed. I was in a narrow room. Boarded window, an empty nightstand, a dresser with a bookshelf across the room. A pitcher of water sat on the countertop beside a tin cup. I tried to climb out of bed, but my ankle was chained to the frame’s post. A short leash. It was then that I realized my wrists were shackled together too.



The floorboards creaked. In the corner of the room, sitting on an old comforter, was a little boy. Ruffled brown-blond hair. Chubby face. Crystal blue eyes. He was dressed in coveralls and rain boots.



He held a book in his hands. The cover was worn, and the pages were a deep shade of yellow. The Very Hungry Caterpillar. My father used to read it to Thomas and me when we were kids.



“Hello there,” I said softly. “Do you have a name?”



The boy closed his book and set it on the counter. “I’m not supposed to talk to you.”



“And why’s that?”



“Because you’re a stranger, and it’s not safe to talk to strangers.”



I chuckled. “That’s very wise of you. Well, you don’t have to talk to me, but do you think you could pour me a cup of water? I’m really thirsty.”



The boy considered this carefully. He retrieved the pitcher of water and poured some into the tin cup. Then, he waddled across the room to give the cup to me. I thought about seizing his wrist, yanking him in close to use as a hostage.



But I had to assume he was a Night Shifter or Hybrid. I could break his neck, and he’d walk it off if I didn’t pierce his heart or brain with silver.



I accepted the cup, thanked him, and chugged the water. I was about to ask him more about himself, hoping to curry his favor, perhaps get some inside information about my current predicament, but the door opened, and the boy scuttled back to his chair.



“I saw you,” Rory said, stepping inside the room. “C’mon, bud, you know you’re not supposed to be in here.”



The boy grabbed his book and started toward the door, head hung low in shame.



Rory ruffled the boy’s hair and smiled down at him. “Your mother’s lookin’ for you. Best not to keep her waiting.” The boy rushed out the door, and Rory closed it behind him. “Sorry about that.”



“Yours?” I asked.



He scoffed. “I know better than to bring a child into this world.” He took a seat at the edge of the bed. “My brother’s boy.”



“Is your brother…”



“Dead? No, you hunters tried to get at him a few years back, but when he had the kid, he stopped leaving the village. World is too dangerous for parents.”



Rory was dressed in a flannel and ripped jeans. A pair of mud-stained boots. He had his hair tied back into a knot. Despite several buckshot blasts, he seemed perfectly healthy, save for some light bruising.



“How long have I been out?” I asked.



“Twelve hours, give or take.”



“Sofia?”



“She’s being debriefed by the mayor.”



“You have a mayor?”



“And what is Sir Rafe to you?”



Good point. I lifted my wrists out from beneath the blankets and rested them on my lap. “Are the shackles really necessary?”



He snorted. “Situation reversed, would your people have bothered putting me in chains?”



He already knew the answer, so there was no point in lying. “They probably would’ve put you in the ground by now.”



“Exactly,” he said. “The shackles stay on until I’m told otherwise.” He removed a brass key from his pocket and unlocked the cuff around my ankle. “However, I am supposed to take you for a walk. Fetch some breakfast too, if you’re hungry.”



“You’re a lot nicer than you were last time we talked.”



“I can be a pretty stand-up guy when there’s not a shotgun pointed at my head.” He stood from the bed and gestured for me to follow. “C’mon, let’s get you some fresh air.”



Begrudgingly, I went with him, exiting the room into a bar area. Empty tables and booths filled the front half of the room. At the back half was the bar counter. It looked like a replica of the tavern back home.



Just like the tavern, there were taxidermied heads mounted on the walls. Human heads. I recognized a few of them. Leonard the Martyr, a hunter who had his last hunt six years prior. Eleanore Crawford, a hunter known for keeping pet ravens. Lucy Smolders, otherwise known as Lucky Lucy. An old friend of Arthur’s. Georgie the Gallant. People still told stories about him. How he’d killed six beasts by himself.



One of the last heads made my heart constrict. Bram the Conductor. He had a railroad spike between his teeth. I searched the other plaques and read the inscriptions on empty ones. There was a pair reserved for Emilia the Ripper and Sir Rafe. But I didn’t see any for Arthur or Nicolas.



Nor myself. I didn’t know whether to be offended or relieved.



“This is a bit cruel, don’t you think?” I asked.



“Don’t act like there aren’t beast heads strewn up back at your village,” Rory said. “I’m sure your collection makes ours seem like child’s play.”



Again, he wasn’t wrong. There were almost too many beast heads mounted in the tavern. So much so, there were discussions about building an addition just to store them.



We headed for the front door. I stopped for a moment to look at Bram. My heart bled for the poor man, but at the same time, it was hard to feel much pity. Hunters didn’t expect honorable deaths. And he probably would’ve preferred to have been kept as a trophy rather than put in the ground or devoured.



“I hope you don’t mind the clothes,” Rory said as we stepped outside. “That's all we had on hand.”



They’d given me a pair of worn trousers and a loose button-up. I would’ve preferred some shoes or boots, but beggars and choosers.



“Did you dress me?” I asked.



He glanced over his shoulder and grinned. “Don’t act so modest. You’ve seen me stripped down to nothing.” After a moment, he added, “Sofia and my sister-in-law managed your accommodations. I just had to drag your ass back here from the city.”



“You poor thing.”



“You’re heavier than you look.”



“Prick.”



Outside, we walked through the streets of a suburban farming town. In the distance, I could see rolling hills and patches of trees. Prairie fields met by expansive farms. Maybe three times the size of the village back home. I had to wonder what their population numbers looked like. Then again, they didn’t have to worry about gaunts or beasts like we did. It was easier for them to survive.



“You know, you oughta be thanking me,” Rory said.



“Thanking you? For taking me captive, putting me in irons, or killing my friends?”



“Sofia took you captive,” he clarified. “And I only killed those two in the cathedral. By the looks of it, I don’t think they were your friends.”



We wandered down the street, passing by a few others. Some human in appearance. Others had fuzzy hair on their arms, necks, and legs as if they’d never shaved a day in their life.



“You should be thanking me for your shoulder,” he continued. “How does it feel?”



I pulled at the collar of my shirt and peered inside. A pink scar remained where Marcus had shot me. No blood, no bullet hole. “How’d you manage that?”



“I told you, beast blood. Restorative properties. And you got some of the best we have to offer.” He pointed to himself.



We stopped at a food distribution at the center of town. People in aprons cooked sausage, bacon, hashbrowns, and eggs on flat tops. I could smell sauteed onions and peppers. My mouth began to water.



The seating was all outdoors. Benches positioned beneath awnings and canopy tents. People sat shoulder to shoulder. Man, woman, and child. They laughed and chattered and played games. 



When we arrived, the laughter died down. A majority of heads turned in my direction. As if they could smell I was a hunter. More likely than not, they’d heard and seen my shackles.



“We’ll take our food to go,” Rory suggested, stepping up to the main counter to order.



We took the streets again shortly after, heading toward the uptown area. Where houses were replaced by merchant stands, shops, and other trade markets.



“So, Sofia,” I said. “Is she a Night Shifter or Hybrid?” I had my answer before he could respond. “Hybrid, right? She doesn’t have a bite mark that I know of.”



“Her and her older brother both,” Rory said. “They, along with a few others, were supposed to infiltrate your village. Keep tabs on everyone so we can live in peace. But you hunters are insistent bastards.” He looked over at me, frowning. “You’re taking this surprisingly well.”



“I think too much has happened for me to be surprised at this point.” That wasn’t true. I was surprised. I was hurt. It felt like I’d been stabbed in the side, left to bleed out. But the pain was postponed by my shock.



You can either swim against the current and let it pull you under, or you let the stream take you wherever it’s intending to go.



“I didn’t know Sofia had a brother,” I said.



“That’s her story to tell, if she wants,” he said. “But I’d be careful if I were you.”



“Why’s that?”



“The surprises don’t stop there.”



I was curious, but he didn’t indulge me any further. The fact that he had told me as much as he did led me to believe I would never be leaving that village. They’d either keep me as a prisoner or, more likely than not, they’d have me executed. Maybe then they’d hang me on the tavern wall.



We went into the village’s town hall and ate our breakfast in the lobby. Rory was friendly in nature, making small talk, but otherwise, we were quiet. I was more interested in my fate than learning more about their village or people.



Eventually, the office door opened. Sofia stepped out. She glanced over at me, but her eyes quickly went to the ground. She was gone before I could speak to her. Rory escorted me inside the room. He was sent away to retrieve “the girl”, leaving me alone with the mayor.



At first, I thought I was dreaming. The man behind the desk had a spiked beard white as snow. He wore a dark suit with a tricorn hat on his head. Wrinkles carved his face, but I couldn’t discern his exact age. He looked in his fifties or so, but realistically, he should’ve been at least in his eighties or nineties.



I recognized him from the signs posted around my home village. H.P. Corbert, our founding father, alive and well despite all claims suggesting otherwise.



“Bernadette Talbot, correct?” he began. “I suspect you know who I am.”



I nodded. “Not a hunter from the village that doesn’t know you.”



“In more ways than one,” he said with a sly grin. “I believe the official name you’ve given me since my departure is ‘White Fang’. Sir Rafe certainly thinks himself clever.”



He offered me a drink. Coffee, water, or something stronger, if I was needing it. I refused. No reason to waste their resources on a corpse.



“I remember your father,” Corbert said. “Before you hunters had Emilia the Ripper, there was Joshua Talbot: the Beast Butcher. He was a good man. I can only hope you’ll be something like him.”



“He never mentioned you, sir.”



“No, I’m sure there’s plenty he didn’t mention. Tell me, what happened to Joshua? Or rather, what do you think happened to him?”



I shrugged. “Died on a hunt, just like a load of others. My mother implied he was killed by Gévaudan.”



“I’m sure that’s what Sir Rafe told her,” he said, fixing me with a studious stare. “Gévaudan is no longer with us.”



“I know. I was there.”



He seemed displeased by my indifference. “To us, her name was Ophelia Vallet. She was one of our best. Disciplined, optimistic, protective. We wouldn’t have thrived as we have if not for her.”



“Do you expect an apology?”



He scoffed. “No. Most hunters don’t bother. However, I do expect you to be a little understanding about what comes next.”



As if summoned, there was a knock on the door. Rory returned with a young girl. No more than ten. She had the same hair as Thomas, but my eyes. I swear, she and Jason could’ve been twins if not for the age difference.



“This is Ophelia’s daughter,” Corbert said. “I thought it was only fair if she should meet the person who killed her mother. Your fate is in her hands, Bernie. Maybe you wanna change your mind about that apology.”



If everything up to that point felt like I’d been stabbed and left to bleed. This revelation was as if someone had taken the blade and pierced me a thousand times over. I gripped the arms of my chair to keep myself upright.



“Do you have a name?” I asked the girl.



“Jamie Vallet,” she said proudly.



“Well, Jamie, here’s the short of it: I killed your mother the other night. Along with Bram the Conductor, Emilia the Ripper, and a few other dead hunters. I didn’t know your mother, other than the stories I’d been told. She was fierce, unyielding, and deadly as they come. I could sit here and apologize. Maybe force out some tears if I tried hard enough. I don’t think you’d buy any of that, and even if you did, I don’t think you’d care, would you?”



Jamie shook her head. Her eyes were bloodshot, and the skin around them was swollen. She’d been crying. I knew what that was like. I’d been there myself when Dad had passed away. Thomas too.



“You want the truth,” I said. “I was sent out specifically to hunt your mother. The only reason I agreed to go was to look for my friend. He died yesterday too. But when I give my word, I try to stand by it. So, I saw the hunt through to the very end. I’m sorry for your loss, and I mean that. But I can’t excuse or apologize for what I did because at the time, I thought I was doing the right thing. Mostly. If you wanna string me up for that, I get it.”



Jamie stared at me with a cold gaze. She nodded and said, “Thank you for your honesty.” She looked at Mayor Corbert. “Can I have some time to think about it?”



“Of course, sweetheart,” he said. “Ms. Talbot is needed for something tonight anyway.”



Rory escorted the girl out and closed the door. I turned back toward Corbert. “How did my father really die?”



He sighed. “We only have rumors, but we suspect it was the Ripper or maybe Sir Rafe or someone from Emilia’s crew. Maybe one of your father’s former subordinates.”



I drummed my fingers against the desk. A loud ringing sound pierced my ears, muffling out the rest of whatever Mayor Corbert had to say. I wanted to close my eyes, open them, and awake in bed at home. Instead, I opened them to find myself still in his office.



“I’ll take that drink now,” I said.



\*\*\*



Once I’d finished my meeting with the mayor, I was retrieved by Rory and returned to the tavern for surveillance. Eventually, Sofia stopped by to visit with me. It was awkward at first, neither of us knowing what to say. And my slight intoxication wasn’t helping me think of anything to say either.



“You’re probably pretty upset with me, huh?” Sofia asked.



“Why? Because you’re a spy for the beasts and have been tricking us for the last two years? Or because you knocked me out and dragged me back to your den where I’ll most likely be executed?”



She chuckled. “At least this hasn’t affected your sense of humor.” She leaned back in her seat and took a deep breath. “There’s something else you should know.”



“Oh, good, more news. Just what I wanted.”



“I was there the night Thomas died,” she said. “I was with my brother, Sergio. He died that night as well. Killed by Arthur.”



My blood turned to ice. I couldn’t decide whether I should cry or leap across the table and throttle her. Upon hearing this, Rory sat up in his seat, ready to lock me up in the back room again if I acted out.



“Sergio wasn’t supposed to transform or attack,” she continued. “But he couldn’t help himself. You see, your brother had killed my Mom about a year before that. Him and Bram. And while we were given strict orders to blend in, Sergio just couldn’t help himself. The second he saw your brother, he lost it.”



“Eye for an eye, is that it?” I said. “My brother killed your mother, so your brother killed Thomas. I’m sure you wanted to weep with joy when you saw what happened to Arthur last night.”



“You’d be wrong. I’m of the few who believe there’s still a chance for humanity. We can coexist. It won’t be easy—in fact, it’ll be utter madness for a while. But I think there’s a chance. And maybe, if we work together, we could make the world whole again.”



I began to laugh. A simple thing at first, but I couldn’t stop it. I must’ve seemed stark raving mad with how much I was laughing.



“Maybe we could coexist,” I offered. “You blended pretty well these last two years. I’m sure there are other spies I don’t even know about. But this ‘making the world whole again’ business, I don’t know about that. We lost the world, and I don’t think we’ll ever get it back. Maybe that’s for the best.”



Sofia nodded somberly. “Well, I’ll leave you to rest for now. If you wanna discuss it further, I’m willing.” She turned toward the exit.



“Soph, hold up a second,” I said. “You didn’t really care if Nicolas was alright, did you? You just wanted to know if he’d killed your friends at the outpost or not.”



She didn’t bother replying and walked out the door. Rory poured us a couple of drinks. We spent the next few hours throwing them back, going toe to toe about who was worse: the beasts or the hunters. I don’t think either of us agreed on the matter. The closest we got to a compromise was: “Maybe neither are all that great.”



That night, I was escorted out to a field. Mayor Corbert was there. As well as Sofia, Jamie, and a dozen others I didn’t recognize. On the field was a wooden pyre made from chopped logs, branches, and leaves. Nicolas’s corpse laid at its center.



Mayor Corbert commended Nicolas for taking a stand against the hunter’s doctrine. For seeing the truth and recognizing the fault of his actions. For going out of his way to try and protect the outpost from other hunters, which ultimately cost him his life. As a thank you, they burned his body, praying his soul would find the Eternal Dream if it hadn’t already.



“What did you do with Arthur?” I asked Rory on the walk back to the tavern.



“We sent some people out to collect Winston’s—Baskerville’s body. Whatever they wanna do to Arthur is up to them.” He thought about it a moment longer. “They’ll probably leave him to rot like the rest of the hunters. Eventually, the carrion crows will find him. Gaunts won’t bother if he was infected before death.”



When we reached the tavern, Rory said, “I'd be less concerned about what happened to him and more concerned about what will happen to you.”

so this is an update on my original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1o0a0i3/timemore\_sculptor\_078s\_grease\_explosion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1o0a0i3/timemore_sculptor_078s_grease_explosion/)

I have now run about 10 shots of espresso for my grinder and is seems that consistency really got a bit better. At the beginning I still had about 10 seconds of variance. But with the same beans now redailed in i get a shot to shot consistency of about + - 3 seconds, which is still not great but a good improvement.

Also some people suggested I should contact Timemore which i did. I had written them the same body from my post and added this section:

    I dont want anything from you as i cleaned the grinder and the noise is gone and it seems to be working fine but maybe this is an issue for other people that can be fixed with new machines or something like that.

Then I got this reply:

    Thank you for your detailed message and for sharing your observations. It sounds like your Sculptor 078S may not have been cleaned for a while, which can cause coffee grounds to build up and affect performance. We recommend regular cleaning: for heavy use, once a week; for moderate use, every 15–20 days. This helps maintain consistent grinding and prevents issues like squeaking or grease contamination. Regarding the sticker you mentioned, that label is our new machine confirmation. Reinstalling the machine under our guidance will not affect your warranty, so please rest assured. For proper reassembly, please refer to our video guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR8X5pXzifs  A key point to note when assembling the locating plate: 1. Keep the positioning pin loose when screwing the plate to the end. 2. Screw the plate backward and match the 0 position line, then tighten the pin. We appreciate your understanding and careful maintenance. Wishing you many enjoyable coffee moments ahead!

I did not get why the reply was mentioning stickers and worry about warranty that i did not mention at all. Then it hit me: This is an  ""A I"" answer i got. I run it trough a detector and jep 100%. I written a answer back that I would like a human to reply and look at this as it is maybe an easy to fix issue.

IMHO i dont think ""A I"" belongs in customer support that is direct contact via E-Mail. In a live chat it can be helpful for sure or on doing some routine task for a customer live to not have a human do that stuff all the time but there should be a ""always human"" route for support (maybe have ""A I"" as a first layer then human) especially for physical products that require some decent field knowledge and understanding to support correctly.

Anyway I am currently okay with the grinder but I will also attempt the bur alignment people mentioned in my original post to get my consistency even better. Just wanted to give you all an update on my journey with this so far.",1,1760349983.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Had a bit of a mixed experience and would like to see if anyone shares the same sentiments!

Original burrs:
The 064s was purchased for use in a small coffee stand, mainly for cold brew and occasional pour-over orders. Sometimes, we use it to single dose espressos when testing new coffees. Hence, we chose the 064s over the 064. However, we have been finding filter brews to always have a drying and astringent sensation. We were unable to truly remove that sensation despite trying different water and workflows (e.g. RDT vs no RDT, knocker vs no knocker). This led us to trying out the Lebrew Sweet 64mm, as it suits the style of brews we’re looking for. Sweetness forward, rounded acidity, not overly transparent, whilst still offering decent clarity. It also has to be espresso capable, but does not have to shine at it.

Swapping burrs:
Removing the burrs was challenging, contrary to what I saw online. The screws holding the original burrs were a pain to remove, and might have stripped them in the process. Had to order new screws by contacting Timemore China directly and had them shipped over. 

After swapping:
After all that trouble, our brews were greatly improved. The flavour presentation matched what Lebrew promised (despite reading mixed experiences in other threads about poor manufacturing QC).
HOWEVER, there were certain quirks that we noticed.
Firstly, the burrs seemed to spin slower. I’m not sure if the weight of the Lebrew burrs were heavier and caused the motors to spin slower. But we noticed that the sound was softer, and the time it took for beans to be ground were sooooo much slower. We currently have it set to the fastest RPM to avoid any possible stalling or motor issues.
Secondly, beans always get stuck in the auger. One of the complains about this grinder was the popcorn-ing issue, which was a small issue for us. But now, we’re seeing that there’ll always been 1-2 remaining beans that continuously rotate in the auger without being fed into the burrs. It needs vigorous shaking and blowing for it to be fed through, which takes up way too much time and effort.

Overall, we don’t regret swapping out the burrs as we have been enjoying the coffee it produces. However, we’re just wondering if other people share the same experience. There’s also a slight concern that we’re wearing out the grinder quickly or risking over-working the motors. And needless to say, swapping burrs would have voided the warranty 😅",1,1760349530.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

The Pentagon is aiming to acquire up to $1bn of critical minerals as part of a global spree to build stockpiles and mitigate China’s dominance over these essential metals, which are crucial for defence manufacturers, reported the [*Financial Times*](https://www.ft.com/content/cd5244eb-a8e9-42bc-8939-71ba0fefa057) (*FT*).  

The US Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is spearheading this initiative, aiming to enhance the national reserve of minerals crucial to defence manufacturers. 

China controls the supply chains for critical minerals and permanent magnets, which are essential for applications including smartphones and military equipment.   
Recently, China expanded its [export restrictions](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/china-expands-rare-earths-export-restrictions/?utm_source=&utm_medium=19-697534&utm_campaign=) on rare earth elements, adding five more elements to the list, and implemented more stringent rules targeting users in the semiconductor industry. 

In response, US President Donald Trump cancelled a planned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports. 

A former defence official told the *FT*: “They \[the US defence department\] are incredibly focused on the stockpile. 

“They’re definitely looking for more, and they’re doing it in a deliberate and expansive way and looking for new sources of different ores needed for defence products.” 

Another former defence official said: “The $1bn investment represents a significant increase in stockpiling efforts.” 

Critical minerals are vital for national security, underpinning weapons systems and technologies such as radar and missile detection. 

The Pentagon’s recent stockpiling activities reflect the Trump administration’s heightened focus on these resources. Some of the targeted metals were not previously stockpiled, according to the report. 

Recently, the DLA purchased up to $500m of cobalt and [$245m of antimony](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/usac-secures-245m-us-defence-contract-for-antimony-supply/?utm_source=&utm_medium=19-696701&utm_campaign=) from the US Antimony Corporation, and $100m of tantalum from an undisclosed US company. 

The agency also procured a combined $45m of scandium from Rio Tinto and APL Engineered Materials. These materials are reserved for national defence needs or wartime. 

This move is part of a broader strategy outlined in US President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA), which includes $7.5bn for critical minerals. 

The act allocates $2bn specifically to strengthen the national defence stockpile, with the Pentagon planning to utilise these funds by late 2026 or early 2027. 

Additionally, the OBBA earmarks $5bn for defence department investments in critical minerals supply chains and provides $500m for a Pentagon credit programme to boost investments.

***Special Report:*** **As China tightens export controls on rare earths and niobium, St George Mining has locked down a $72.5 million cash infusion to advance its Araxá rare earths and niobium project in Brazil.**

[**St George Mining’s (ASX:SGQ)**](https://stockhead.com.au/company/st-george-mining-sgq/)Araxá project is the largest and highest-grade carbonatite rare earth element (REE) resource in South America, representing a strategically important source of rare earths and niobium outside of China.

The project’s mineral resource estimate (MRE) includes six of the top 10 critical minerals on the US Department of Interior’s list, including samarium, lutetium, terbium, dysprosium, gadolinium and niobium.

With 40.6Mt at 4.13% total rare earth oxides and 41.2Mt at 0.68% niobium held within its MRE, Araxá is set to grow further.

SGQ is targeting an MRE expansion and upgrade with a major drilling program already underway, supported by fresh funding from investors.

# ‘Enormous potential’ recognised

St George Mining executive chair John Prineas said the company was delighted with the strong support received from both local and overseas institutional investors, who recognise the “enormous potential” of the high-grade Araxa project.

“We are also very pleased that Hancock Prospecting has chosen to increase its existing shareholding in St George and emerge as a substantial shareholder,” Prineas said.

“Hancock Prospecting is a company with significant experience in recognising the value in strategic commodities and backing successful critical minerals companies including MP Materials and Lynas Corporation – as well as having significant project execution and delivery experience for St George to leverage off in the future.”

# Accelerating demand for rare earths

Last week, Beijing expanded export controls on critical minerals including rare earths and niobium.

Exporters are now required to obtain permission to export technologies used for rare earth mining, smelting and processing, with a particular emphasis on forbidding any military applications.

As China currently processes about 90% of the world’s rare earth minerals, and accounts for about 70% of total mining of the critical minerals, the export controls have sparked burgeoning demand for ex-China supply.

The US Department of Interior has identified niobium supply in particular as a strategic priority, as the loss of foreign supply is projected to cause the second-largest deficit in GDP of all critical minerals assessed.

# Working towards a final investment decision

Prineas said Araxá’s Tier-1 location, existing infrastructure and access to renewable energy had made it a magnet for investors seeking ex-China supply.

“We believe the Araxá Project has the potential to be developed under an accelerated timeline to become one of the few next-generation rare earths and niobium producers worldwide, something investors are wanting to be part of,” he said.

“The new funding will bolster St George’s program of advancing the Araxá Project through feasibility study work and towards a financial investment decision.”

The $72.5 million cash injection will support an aggressive drilling program targeting resource expansion and an upgrade of Araxa’s JORC confidence level.

Once the program is complete, St George will move onto project permitting, metallurgical testwork, pilot plant development, and feasibility study work.

The fresh funding will also close out a deferred cash consideration payable to Itafos Inc.

“We thank existing and new shareholders for their support in St George and recognition of our efforts to deliver significant, sustained value from the Araxá Project,” Prineas said.

“We are excited about providing more updates as we advance this truly unique critical minerals opportunity.”

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Australia is formulating a plan for its critical minerals reserve that will focus on sales of future production, limiting the need for a physical stockpile, industry sources said, as Australian and U.S. leaders prepare to meet next week.

Australia's critical minerals task force hosted a call last week with miners and project developers across a range of metals as it steps up industry consultations, according to four sources familiar with the matter.

The task force is seeking by the end of the year to have finalized its policy recommendations for the structure of a A$1.2 billion ($782 million) stockpile of minerals that it believes is vulnerable to supply disruption. The stockpile, which is expected to focus on rare earths, is expected to be ready by the second half of 2026.

Reuters previously reported that Australia was willing to sell shares in its reserve to allies, including Britain.

The push comes as Australia seeks to leverage its strategic importance as a key supplier to its allies ahead of a meeting between Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Oct. 20. Australia's resource and trade ministries declined to comment.

Last week, Beijing tightened export restrictions on rare earths ahead of talks between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of the month. China produces more than 90% of the world's processed rare earths and rare earth magnets and has used export restrictions to throttle shipments, amplifying global concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities.

""We've got vast resources of the critical minerals that the world is going to need to decarbonize, to build data centers, to process AI,"" trade minister Don Farrell told Australian broadcaster ABC on Sunday.

""We need to have a broad range of customers, firstly to provide us with the capital to extract the products, but secondly, to ensure that we've got guaranteed markets to sell these critical minerals,"" he said.

""We've been talking to the Europeans ... the Japanese, the Koreans and of course we're talking with the Americans.""  
According to the sources, government officials are eager to show that they are in ""listen mode."" One person said that companies have been asked to make written submissions.

Rather than stockpiling critical metals, participating governments would agree on annual supplies for future years and miners would sell those metals directly to consumers. The volume of that supply would then be deducted from the amount owed under a bilateral deal.

""It’s more like a financial instrument than a physical stockpile,"" one of the sources said.

Australian officials have yet to determine how risks will be managed for smaller markets like heavy rare earths, where most of the world's prices are tied to a China-based index that Western developers say is artificially set too low.

Earlier this year, the U.S. government offered a multibillion-dollar deal to support its flagship rare earths producer, MP Materials, which included a minimum price that buyers must pay.

Australia has said it is considering a similar plan, but sources said it would seek to reduce its financial exposure.

""In an ideal world, Australia doesn't spend any money and acts more like a facilitator, so the other (consumer) countries are underwriting a floor price,"" a source said.

Another idea that is circulating would have Australia contributing trades or material to back a ""functioning Western price index,"" one source said. Another source said this idea was unlikely to work because the market size was too small to be liquid.

# ***Just How Does Niocorp's Elk Creek Project compare to other ""World Class Projects?"" You might ask??.....

# ~ ***This Response from Jim/Niocorp is one of my favorites for New Investors Seeking to invest in Critical Minerals Projects! Shared once again....(***Must READ if you haven't done so....)~

# 5/27/2022 -How Does Niocorp's Elk Creek Project compare to other ""World Class Projects?""

**\*\*\*RESPONSE**

""It is a bit tricky to compare rare earth projects on an apples-to-apples basis, which is why we chose to limit the comparison of our Elk Creek resource to other REE projects in the U.S. There are several reasons why. For one, there are several different legal systems that determine how a project can measure and disclose aspects of its mineral resource and/or reserve.

For public companies that are SEC-reporting entities (such as NioCorp), the SK1300 standard must be followed. For public companies regulated by Canadian authorities (also such as NioCorp), there is the National Instrument 43-101 disclosure standard.

In Australia, there is the JORC standard. Each of these systems differ in what they allow, or don't allow, in terms of public disclosure of mineral resources and reserves. This can lead to 'apples-to-oranges' comparisons among projects. Another challenge in making such comparisons is the mineralization of an REE project. Some projects can show a high ore grade of rare earths, but the mineralization of the ore is something that is very difficult to process. For example, rare earth projects based on silicate-based minerals -- such as eudialyte -- are extraordinarily difficult to economically process in order to pull the REEs out and separate them. Others can contain relatively high levels of other impurities, such as naturally occurring radioactive elements, that can increase the cost of processing. A high ore grade doesn't mean a lot if the REE mineralization isn't amenable to processing that is technically or economically infeasible.

This is why only a small handful of the more than 200 REE-containing minerals have ever been successfully processed economically at commercial scale. ***(The two primary REE-containing minerals in the Elk Creek Project, bastnasite and monazite***, ***are among those that have been successfully processed for decades)***.

Rare earth resources also differ in terms of the relative distribution of individual REEs in the host mineral. Some may have a relatively high ore grade but also have high percentages of less valuable REEs, such as cerium or lanthanum or yttrium. Others have lower ore grades but their REE mineralization is skewed more favorably to higher-value REEs, such as the magnetics neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium which are used in NdFeB magnets.

There are several other REEs that are also magnetic, such as samarium, but those are of lower value. Another way that REE projects are compared to one another is through a so-called “basket price.” This is a particularly misleading way of valuing a rare earth play, in my opinion, because a project’s ‘basket price’ assigns a dollar value to the individual REEs in the ore, multiplying total tonnes of each REE by current market price for that REE, and combines them all together. This assumes that a project will produce each and every one of the REEs in the ‘basket’ (which is almost never the case). It also ignores the enormous CAPEX and OPEX required to produce 14 or so individual REEs.

**There are yet other factors that help determine the viability of a potential rare earth project. \~Some projects are aimed at only producing rare earths. That means that they are relatively riskier investments than projects that are designed to produce multiple products in addition to rare earths.**

***A)\~Some projects that are relatively large in size, have high ore grades, and are comprised of processable minerals -- but they are located in places that make mining and processing difficult or very expensive. I can think of a few projects that are touted as attractive deposits but are located near or above the Arctic Circle, which generally makes mining more costly.***

***B)\~ Others are located in places where there local residents, such as First Nations communities in Canada or anywhere in Greenland, can readily block a project from moving to commercial operation. Still others are in countries where local governments are less stable than in the U.S., or are simply prone to corruption, which exposes the project to high country risk.***

***C)\~Many REE projects are proposed by teams that have no experience in commercially processing REEs. They tend to gloss over that fact. Knowing what I know about the challenges of producing separated, high-purity REEs, this is one of the most important factors I consider when I look at REE projects. But that is just my opinion.***

A more useful comparison strategy for investors is to look at rare earth projects through multiple lenses, such as those I describe above. It is not easy to do this if one doesn’t have a pretty deep understanding of the REE industry and the challenges of successfully making these strategic metals.

# Having said all of that, it’s clear that our Elk Creek carbonatite is very large and similar in total contained rare earths to some of the largest known rare earth resources in the world, including the Araxa carbonatite in Brazil and the St. Honore carbonatite in Quebec.""

# Scandium isn’t just another input — it’s the material unlock for America’s next aerospace leap!

[MUST WATCH EVENT @@!! IF YOU HAVE NOT DONE SO..](https://preview.redd.it/wvxn8fsopuuf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaefa5f029db1e7dfcc9a80c11ce5373e888d66b)

# 🛑 1. Titanium

* **Confirmed:** talks with *three* U.S. majors. That’s the supply chain gap (aerospace, defense coatings, alloys).
* **Read-through:** Niocorp is positioning itself as a domestic TiCl₄/TiO₂ anchor, and that’s squarely in the **DoD/DOE wheelhouse**. A major U.S. titanium producer (think **TIMET/ATI** or even **Chemours** for TiCl₄) could lock in here.

# 🛑 2. Rare Earths / Stellantis

* **Stellantis drama** → slowed by management reshuffles, but “back on track.”
* **Read-through:** Stellantis is *still live*. They want *all* REEs. If the DFS proves scale and recovery, Stellantis could come in with a **multi-metal anchor offtake.**

# 🛑 3. Scandium Metal Demonstration

* DoD involved → using two different methods to produce scandium metal.
* NanoScale-like tech strongly suggests collaboration with Ames Lab / Nanoscale Powders type pathways.
* First Metal Nov 2025. That’s basically a demo milestone that could trigger direct DoD procurement & validation.

# 🚨 Game-changer alert for Niocorp 🚨 ~BELOW~

# 🛑 4. ScAl Alloy + Gen VI Fighters (**🔥 HUGE)

* Direct quote: Working with a DoD prime contractor on Sc-Al alloy integration.
* Gen VI fighter → 360° view, doubled threat detection, range boost.
* This is an operational security tell — ScAl alloys are already in classified development pathways for NGAD (Next Gen Air Dominance).

# ****Mark teased a partnership soon. That’s your strategic bombshell!!!! ""Staying Tuned!""....

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

[See for yourself...](https://preview.redd.it/svsws06tpuuf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f1698ef8b76b155102d23a9ac3a84e30bfdd28c)

# [NioCorp\_Presentation.pdf](https://www.niocorp.com/wp-content/uploads/NioCorp_Presentation.pdf)

🚨 **NIOCORP — DRILL RESULTS DUE ANY DAY NOW! (Mid–Late Oct 2025)** 🚨

IMHO — The next catalyst window has opened. Niocorp’s expanded drill program (9 infill + 6 step-outs) could confirm a *1,000,000-tonne TREO resource,* lifting every core metal — **Nb, Sc, Ti, and REEs** — into a higher valuation bracket. Mid–late October assay drops align perfectly with the **Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS)**, setting the stage for a full-scale re-rating. This isn’t just another junior mining story — this is the *U.S. critical-minerals platform* coming of age in real time.

Last week’s **new S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf Registration)** filing changes the game entirely. Unlike the capped $200M shelf, this is an **unlimited-capacity registration**, identical in structure to the one **MP Materials used when the DoD took a direct equity stake earlier this year.** That means Niocorp now has the legal and financial runway to bring in *strategic and government capital directly* — think **Defense Prime anchors, EXIM or DFC co-financing, and even a potential U.S. Government equity position**. At a new \~$1B market cap and $10+ share price, Niocorp can now raise major project or downstream funding with minimal dilution — a night-and-day contrast to the $2–3 levels earlier this year.

Following the **Munich-to-Washington handoff**, CEO Mark Smith declared Elk Creek a *“U.S. National Security Asset”* — and then took that message to J.P. Morgan’s Export Finance Forum in D.C. Institutional bids, defense-linked capital, and agency lenders (EXIM + DFC) are now circling as **Sc-Al alloy integration for Gen VI fighters** moves into classified development under DoD oversight. November’s **Scandium Metal Unveiling** remains the next confirmed waypoint, with policy momentum from the Trump administration’s **Critical Minerals Directive** accelerating the push toward *direct U.S. ownership and price-floor protection*.

🧭 **Bottom Line:**  
**🔥 “More Core = More Ore.”**  
**The 2025 drill campaign is transformative.** The 2022 Feasibility Study locked in 632 K tonnes TREO, **but this year’s results could prove out nearly a million.** More core means greater geological confidence, extended mine life, and room to scale every strategic output — **Niobium, Scandium, Titanium, and Rare Earths** — right as U.S. defense, aerospace, and EV sectors scramble for secure domestic supply. Combined with the S-3ASR, NioCorp now holds the keys to the full mine-to-metal-to-manufacturing supply chain. The *“National Security Asset” ignition window* is officially wide open. 🛰️⚡

# ""Elk Creek as a “U.S. National Security Asset"" moment has arrived! —  🛰️⚡""

im really awkward when im into a guy so for a few months i kept my distance but he kept trying to close the distance for a while like he would suggest we get coffee on our breaks (i never took up the offer) or always hold doors for me even when he was far away. but recently i decided to actually try and put in effort and stop being super nervous which definitely encouraged him to be more obvious 😭

he even reposted a tiktok about being bad at flirting with women the same day he saw me and i lowkey think it’s about me…

I'm completely new to this! But I love mushrooms. 

I recently bought the label Bonjour Café which I think is a total rip off, one pack is 33€ and good for 30 cups of coffee, it's supposedly an alternative to coffee with mushrooms. 

But I'm not a coffee addict, the only reason I bought it  is because of the mushrooms in it and I'm hoping to reduce inflammation, bloated belly and gas which are all things I have on a daily basis. 

I was wondering if an alternative to this would be: 
- growing maitake to help with the stomach 
- growing lionsmane 
- and maybe one more 
(There's a small company in Belgium who send you growing kits but maitake is labelled as more challenging) 

Drying them, making the powder (or else) myself and add it to teas or other things. 

Is that just completely bananas? Hahaha

I love the early morning hours. I sit in my chair, sipping my coffee, and I listen to the sounds outside my house. I feel like I’m the only person alive in those hours. But the stillness also leaves me feeling lonely. Lately this ache has crept its way further into my bones and leaves me desiring a connection that might make me feel a little more human once again. 

I’m quiet, gentle, and introverted. I love philosophy, foreign films, history, and literature. I love deep conversations and hearing your thoughts on everything. I’m agnostic and a leftist. Though I’m not anti-religion. Kurt Vonnegut summed up my ethics when he wrote, “there’s only one rule: Goddamn it, you have to be kind”. I try to live by this, but I fail more often than I like. Lately I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how to keep the spark of human kindness alive, when the whole world sometimes seems hell bent on extinguishing it.

 I’m 6’5”, brown hair, and bluish green eyes. My body type is average. I’m happy to exchange SFW pictures when we are both comfortable. I promise I will quote too many Bright Eyes and Leonard Cohen lyrics. 

I’m ultimately looking for my person. But I know these things take time. I would love to learn more about you. What’s the last song you listened to on repeat? Who is the artist who’s art you like the most? Who is your favorite filmmaker? You don’t need to answer these questions if you don’t want to. But if anything I’ve said caught your attention, please reach out. I’d love to hear from you. I can’t always immediately reply. Regardless of whether I hear from you, I wish everyone the best on their search. I know how lonely it can be trying to find a partner.

im really awkward when im into a guy so for a few months i kept my distance but he kept trying to close the distance for a while like he would suggest we get coffee on our breaks (i never took up the offer) or always hold doors for me even when he was far away. but recently i decided to actually try and put in effort and stop being super nervous which definitely encouraged him to be more obvious 😭
 
he even reposted a tiktok about being bad at flirting with women the same day he saw me and i lowkey think it’s about me…

Okay then.,"A few years ago, I worked as a paralegal at a boutique law firm. The partners were great, but our new office manager let's call her Marlene was all about rules. She loved enforcing them selectively and had this power trip about time tracking.

I was often in at 8:30 and stayed until 5:30, not for brownie points it just worked for my schedule. But one morning, I came in at 9:10 because of a doctor’s appointment. Marlene pounced.

You’re expected to be here from 9 to 5. Not 9:10 to whenever-you-feel-like-it. You need to follow the exact hours.

I reminded her I usually stayed late and even had emails timestamped at 6 PM. She didn’t care. She wanted exactly 9 to 5. Nothing more, nothing less.

So the next day I walked in at 9:00:00, coffee in hand. And every day after that, I shut down my computer at exactly 5:00:00, even mid-task. If someone needed help at 5:01? Sorry! Marlene said 9 to 5 only.

This lasted two weeks before the senior partner called me in, confused why I was “less available.” I explained the directive. Let’s just say Marlene had a “performance review” shortly after and I went back to working like a human again.",209,1760348782.0,MaliciousCompliance,12,0.95,False

It started out unpretentiously, creating championships in Excel for a fictional career, starting with the MRX5 Cup and Clio Cup, and progressing as you gain prominence and experience (what the game should be, instead of the coffee-menu system).

In the last few months, I've simulated the SRO championships in Europe, two seasons in GT4, and now finishing my third season in GT World Challenge Europe. Using real teams, real car designs, and mixing real and fictional drivers.

I'm running endurance races, on average 6x faster. I complete 3-6 hour races in 1 hour, including tire and fuel wear. I simulated the 24 Hours of Spa in 4 hours. And the level of challenge is good. I avoid racing the strongest cars, so I don't win every race, and it's a cool title fight.

I'm moving to Japan now to race in Super Formula for ""a few years"" and then ""retire this character in the WEC or IMSA, driving Gr. 1.""

I created a fictional team, with its own visual identity and decals. I'll share some images here. But what I wanted to say here is that I've seen a lot of people complaining about the game's ""campaign"": screw the coffee menu, finish it, and create your own game in the custom races.

I'm hoping to get some advice from those of you familiar with the Greek language programs at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH).

A bit about me: I'm working full-time but am really motivated to learn Greek. I'm no stranger to a demanding schedule, as I completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees while working, so let's just say I'm used to the stress! :D

I'm part Greek and can speak and read a little, but I'm basically a beginner (A1 at best, lol). I can introduce myself, order coffee, water, and a bougatsa, and I know some random words, but that's about it. To be honest, my grammar is dogshit, and I really want to improve so I can actually speak this beautiful language properly.

I've looked into a few other courses, but they were either way too expensive or too time-intensive (10+ hours a week, which would probably get me fired, lol). My research led me to AUTH and it seems like a great option because the prices are reasonable, the certificate could be a nice to have for future employers, and I've read many good reviews about their courses here and on other forums.

Ideally, I'm looking for a course with 1-3 live sessions per week that I can take after work. However, this is where I'm getting confused about their offerings:

1. **The 8-MONTH (4H/W) COURSE:** The description is a little confusin. It says you take a level like 'A2 (from A2 to A2)' or 'C2 (from C2 to C2.1)', but the syllabus seems to list all the levels of Greek. Does this mean you enroll in a *single level* (like A2) that lasts for the entire 8 months, or does the course progress through multiple levels?
2. **The 6-WEEK COURSE (early 2026):** For this one, the recommendation says 'A1 + A2', but the detailed description states it's for 'EITHER A1 OR A2'. This seems contradictory. I'm completely confused and can't figure out which course would be right for me.

Is there a course that i can take next year that teaches multiple levels of Greek in one go or do I need to do them separatley?

🙍🏻‍♂️ Tyler, the founder, multitasker, and quiet force that keeps everything connected. From IT to accounting to customer support, he’s the one who makes it all work. Always curious, and would 100% have the time of his life working a month in a Japanese coffee shop.

🙍🏼‍♀️ Josephine, the friendly voice behind most of your emails. She keeps the inbox calm and has an impressive ability to surprise us with the breakfasts she shows up with (neither burger or gummy candy would surprise us anymore), always keeping the team laughing.

🙍🏻‍♂️ Børge, our warehouse hero and problem solver. If we talk about building a new shelf system, give him an hour, it’ll already be done. He keeps things tidy in the warehouse, loves fruity African coffees, and even dares to say infused coffee can be good (controversial, we know).

🙍🏻‍♀️ Lene is the creative one behind our words, photos, and storytelling. She drinks coffee by the bucket (none of those tiny cups, thank you) and she's working on perfecting foaming milk and actually making barista worthy latte art, with still a long way to go.

We share a love for great coffee and the people behind it, and we want to make specialty coffee feel simple, honest and enjoyable. Some of us bring calm and order, others bring ideas and curiosity, and between us, it all just works.

\- if choosing between Bambino plus and Barista Express, which one is better? The price difference is about $150 now so I could get a Baratza ESP to go along Bambino.

  
For milk I have tried heating milk in stovetop/microwave and then french press, and also with Aeroccino. The latter has no hope whatsoever on latte art...but even beside art, the taste is really different from steamed milk.

1o5f7i3,https://i.redd.it/9txo83a6nuuf1.jpeg,"One Step at a Time A short story about love, patience, and true connection.","Originally shared on Wattpad, this short story is close to my heart — a quiet tale of love, patience, and emotional intimacy. I wanted to share it here too, with all of you.

Aarav was 20 when he met Meera, who was just a year younger. What started as a shy conversation over coffee at a college event soon grew into something far deeper than either of them expected.

Over the next three years, their relationship bloomed — not quickly, but gradually, with care. They shared everything: their dreams, their fears, childhood stories, even silent moments that felt louder than words. While others around them rushed through love, Aarav and Meera chose to build it — brick by brick, moment by moment.

Their emotional connection was rare. Meera never hesitated to talk about her day, her doubts, or her insecurities. Aarav listened with patience, never judging. And Aarav, in return, found in Meera the kind of comfort he had never known — the kind where he could just be himself.

They laughed through late-night calls, supported each other through exams, celebrated small wins, and cried together during setbacks. There was no pretending — only honesty.

They trusted each other so much that even in moments of vulnerability — like when Meera pulled Aarav into a dressing room just to help her choose between two dresses — it felt completely natural. Their bond wasn’t just romantic; it was built on pure emotional intimacy.

But There Was One Unspoken Thing

Despite how close they were, neither of them brought up anything physical.
Not because they didn’t want to — in truth, both had thought about it.
But they were afraid.

Afraid that bringing it up might make the other uncomfortable.
Afraid that it might make their intentions seem shallow.
So, silently, they waited. Out of respect. Out of love.

Three Years Later…

They stood at the edge of a new beginning. Their wedding was just a day away. A quiet evening settled over them as they sat together, hand in hand, both aware that this moment marked the end of one chapter and the beginning of another.

And finally… they spoke.

Aarav said softly,
“There’s something I’ve never said out loud, but I’ve felt it for a long time.
I’ve always wanted to be closer to you — physically — but I didn’t know if it was right to say it.
I never wanted you to think I was rushing or expecting anything.”

Meera looked up, a shy smile playing on her lips.

“I’ve felt the same, Aarav. I just… didn’t want to change anything between us.
What we have is already so beautiful.”

They both laughed quietly — not because it was funny, but because it was a relief.
A relief to finally say what had been in their hearts.

And they agreed:

“Let’s take a small step forward.
Nothing rushed. Nothing forced.
Just… together. With full trust.”

The Wedding Day

It was grand. Beautiful. Emotional. Full of rituals, relatives, noise, and joy.

By the time the last guest had left and the final goodbye was said, Meera and Aarav were exhausted. The heavy clothes, the endless traditions, the spotlight — it had all taken a toll.

That night, as they entered their decorated room, petals on the bed and candles flickering, they looked at each other with sleepy eyes and full hearts.

Aarav whispered, “We made it.”
Meera nodded, cheeks slightly pink. “We did.”

They undressed slowly — not out of seduction, but out of comfort. She took off her jewelry as he helped, each piece falling away like the last bits of formality between them.

They climbed into bed — side by side, face to face.

They held hands.
They smiled.

No pressure. No expectations. Just peace.

Meera whispered, “Let’s just sleep together tonight.”
Aarav kissed her forehead. “That’s more than enough.”

And So, Their First Step Forward...

…was not passion or urgency,
But the simple, sacred act of resting in each other’s arms.

That night, they didn’t just sleep together —
They began a new chapter of love.
One that would, like everything else in their story, unfold…

One step at a time.

When we analyzed them, three repeatable emotional beats emerged that drive shares and saves across brands like Starbucks, Krispy Kreme, and Chipotle:

1️⃣ **The Comfort Bite** — the sensory “relief” moment (bite, drip, steam).

2️⃣ **The Sip Reset** — the micro-pause that shifts the vibe.

3️⃣ **The Everyday Ritual** — the repeatable, human routine.

“Our data revealed a simple truth: the moments you share aren’t about what’s fancy; they’re about what’s felt.”

**(0:08 – 0:15)** Krispy Kreme glaze drip → Subway cookie break.

“The Comfort Bite. Not gourmet, but grounding.”

“The Sip Reset: a small pause that shifts your mindset.”

**(0:24 – 0:33)** Chipotle guac → Starbucks hand-off → friends outside.

“The Everyday Ritual: the best moments aren’t accidents; they’re habits.”

**(0:34 – 0:43)** Flashy food ads vs. calm real moments.

A 58-second storytelling experiment built entirely with AI tools: script, pacing, and edit guidance, but driven by *real ad data*, not AI guesses. It’s based on **1,736 Facebook food & beverage ads (Aug 2025 window)**.

When we analyzed them, three repeatable emotional beats emerged that drive shares and saves across brands like Starbucks, Krispy Kreme, and Chipotle:

1️⃣ **The Comfort Bite** — the sensory “relief” moment (bite, drip, steam).

2️⃣ **The Sip Reset** — the micro-pause that shifts the vibe.

3️⃣ **The Everyday Ritual** — the repeatable, human routine.

# Creative Breakdown (transcript summary)

“Our data revealed a simple truth: the moments you share aren’t about what’s fancy; they’re about what’s felt.”

**(0:08 – 0:15)** Krispy Kreme glaze drip → Subway cookie break.

“The Comfort Bite. Not gourmet — but grounding.”

**(0:16 – 0:23)** Coke fizz → iced coffee swirl → Dunkin splash.

“The Sip Reset — a small pause that shifts your mindset.”

**(0:24 – 0:33)** Chipotle guac → Starbucks hand-off → friends outside.

“The Everyday Ritual — the best moments aren’t accidents; they’re habits.”

**(0:34 – 0:43)** Flashy food ads vs. calm real moments.

“Brands sell spectacle… but people share sensation.

**(0:44 – 0:58)** Coke fizz → Dunkin ice → Krispy Kreme glaze → Starbucks cup.

“Every sip, bite, and pause: they all matter.”

So, long story short, I started a new job a few weeks ago and so did my GF of 6 months. I used to work from home and had optimized my lifestyle for pre-work gym 4 times a week and afterwork activities like MMA (3-4 times a week) and salsa (2 times a week). 

The problem is my new job is both full-on and in the office which has meant that I'm basically exhausted non-stop. I've cut down on coffee so my energy levels stay more or less level throughout the day, but I still find myself tired as hell by the evening. That's led to me skipping a lot of workouts and regressing back into old habits (porn use....) which now makes me feel guilty and frustrated. Tbh, the downturn started around midsummer as my discipline faded a bit around holidays and trips, but I'm definitely feeling the change in my lifestyle now.

I'm not sure if I'm looking for tough love or just venting here, but it's been really frustrating. I'm not being the best version of myself, but I'm having issues getting back in the swing of things.

Things with my girl are going well overall, she's showing a lot of affection, but we haven't been that sexual over the last two weeks. We had sex twice on the day after we went skydiving the weekend before last, but nothing since then. She keeps reaching out to me, we spend almost every evening together, but there's little sex happening. On one side, it's kinda my fault since I'm just constantly exhausted, but on another it feels like she's not as sexual as before. She did start to feel a bit sickly over the last few days and her period started, but it feels like overall we're getting less sexual than before. 

I've mentioned this before here months ago, but she's got some SA trauma and she's not fully healed. She told me she's found a sex therapist and she's seeing her soon. A suggestion I got on here was to not focus on sex as much and just have a good time with her. I've been doing that, but it feels like if I don't initiate somehow, we'd barely have sex once a week.

Anyway, do you guys have any tips for me? I mostly know what I need to do - get back on the horse and hit my workouts as usual, maybe reduce the load a bit so I'm not dead by the end of the week, be the best version of myself. However, I may be burning out here, I would appreciate some feedback on that, too. Could be worth seeing her less often so she misses me more, too.",1,1760347534.0,CoreyWayne,0,1.0,False
1o5f06u,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/1o5f06u/trying_to_understand_if_the_interest_is_shared/,Trying to Understand if the Interest is Shared,"I'm trying to read this guy at work, and it's difficult because of many factors.

First point I need to make is there is a rule at work that there is a no fraternizing rule for upper management and below. He's upper management, I'm not. It's a restaurant, he's back of house (kitchen) and I'm front of house (bar).

So he's been at this job for quite a few years, I'm relatively new. Didn't really notice him much, I usually work nights and he finishes his shift in the evenings. But he always has a few drinks after work. There are a few bars in different areas of the restaurant. After a few conversations he religiously would sit at the bar I worked at for his after work drink. 

There was flirtation a bit (I keep it straegic because the level of gossip in this type of work environment is junior high school level, and I've learned to keep my private life away from work). Eventually I took his phone and added my number. He added me on social media (it's not a big deal, he's friends with many of my coworkers on there). I discovered that bartenders and servers frequently go out for drinks in groups with managers. He doesn't too much, keeps to himself mostly, but still joins in here and there. 

A handful of times we got off work at the same time, and went out for a few drinks afterwards. Nothing weird or crossing any line, just really good conversation. But man did he seem really uncomfortable. Arms crossed, kept repeating ""I don't know"" after answering my questions. But after every walk back to the parking lot, there was a hug. Each time getting tighter. I flat out asked him if he wanted to spend time with me outside of work, which threw him off guard, he paused and said under his breath ""...maybe.""

This guy suddenly became very guarded and distant. At work, he's joking and laughing with coworkers but with me he's suddenly quiet and barely responsive now. 

Yet he still chooses to sit at the bar I work at. Still notice him watching me from the other side of the room. Yet the past couple of times I texted him to see if he wanted to grab drinks after, I get no response. He'll get me coffee and leave it for me at my work space without saying anything. He'll randomly (but rarely) text me asking about things I write about my life on social media (though he doesn't comment or react on any of it).

After a couple of tries, I just stopped asking if he wanted to grab drinks. Or spend time. It's not awkward at all at work; I go about my day and am still friendly with him. But seriously, what's the deal?

Some background, I know he's divorced, has kids (has 50/50 custody). Very private about his personal life, except for the handful of times we had drinks one on one and he talked about himself a bit more.

I'm leaning towards a combination of fear around work rules and just fear in general. I'm wondering what made him suddenly pull back. I've made it very clear that I don't fit in to the cookie cutter mold of the typical person in this industry. Told him about one of the best relationships I ever had was years ago, with someone in management, and we kept it so private that for the two years of us dating (and even after the relationship ended), nobody at work had any clue we were dating. 

It's like he makes an effort to be near me as much as possible physically but the way he acts with me seems like he's intimidated.

I'm not pushing anything. I've learned that if someone feels comfortable saying or doing things, then they'd do it. But at this point I don't even know if he's even remotely interested anymore, or if I should pursue anything. Or even try.

How does everyone else cope? Or not totally explode? Is there some pathway I’m missing to ease the strain? 

Anyone else feel they are getting constantly pigeon-holed, labelled and generally ‘explained’ by other people since diagnosis, or on meds? 

I only managed to get ADHD medication (privately) end of last year. I also have bipolar, which was diagnosed in 2023. I am stable. My elvanse seems to be working for me. I’ve just gone back to work from maternity leave into an already hideously toxic situation, which is just escalating, and last week I discovered I am now in the menopause, (skipped peri because GP ignored blood tests, age, history etc). Told I can’t have HRT because of everything else I’m having is toll on my liver. 

Apparently exercise, stress management, diet and sleep will help just as much as HRT, (what a load of shite!). Considering I was white knuckling it for years and have 2 young children, I’m constantly on the go. Plus I have an 11 month old baby and only stopped breastfeeding last month. I can’t currently drive due to holding a medical licence so I walk and cycle everywhere, usually with the kids. Often carrying at least one of them. Eating?! I rarely get to eat a decent full meal until kids are in bed. Admittedly the Elvance crash triggers sugar binges, but they aren’t too hideous.

Everyday since my bipolar diagnosis, it’s been constant self management and diagnostic regime of self care, therapy, CBT, DBT…blah, blah, blah…etc. I’m doing it myself. I’m trying what I can. I am aware my health and condition impacts others as well as myself. Because it did, 2022 was a truly hideous year for me and my family. I nearly lost my family, my job, myself, got arrested while manic attempting to drive a car, and it could have been way, way worse. 

However, everyone seems to want to throw their 2 pence in to ‘help me out’. It’s driving me insane and making me explode. I’m trying to work things out for best I can, it’s a learning process for me too. I’ll probably be doing it forever. I feel like my maturity level has been ripped back to 20, not the mind of a middle aged, menopausal woman with 2 kids under 5. Who probably has taken the breaks off a bit and has a decent sense of self. 

Literally every day is about keeping it together atm I’m in a horrible situation at work, daughter has started school and misses her friends, and baby is in nursery bringing all sorts of germs home. Partner is trying but he geeks I don’t listen and am too caught up in myself, so we row. I din’t feel he listens and vice versa. We are in a waiting list for couples therapy. 

With drug shortages some days I’m living on Solphadine, coffee and protein shakes due to exhaustion, brain fog and threatening migraines. 

I feel I’m trying to explain myself to people even more than before because they don’t get it and put it down to one, or all of the diagnosis. Maybe I’m just sick?! Maybe I’m just tired? Busy? Trying to concentrate! All of it. It’s not one of the disorders! I can be sick, tired, frustrated, upset, angry…just like an  average, annoying healthy, unworried, organised neurotypical. It doesn’t have to be related to a ‘thing’. 

When I try to explain myself, I’m either whining or talking about myself too much. So guard is up , mask is on. Pretty much all day, everyday. 

It’s exhsustjng and frustrating. I’m finding myself having to mask more and more and I still offend someone along the way. 

Anyone else feel like this? How to you manage? How to you escape? Do you scream? Take up boxing? I’d have to get a punch bag due to do bring able to get out much 😂🤬

Have purchased quite an expensive yoga mat, it has alignment lines, extra anti-slip technology and is very pretty. So I might actually do yoga if it’s next to me when I work. 

Or it’ll end up tucked behind my sofa bed long with the folding treadmill I used for 3 minutes. 

Tbh, best exercise for me involves leaving the house. I’ve tried creating a zen space but the only room for it is the guest/baby/my office room. It’s remains clutter free for about an hour a day.

Chapter 1 - The Wedding That Wasn't Mine

My phone blew up mid-meeting with the execs.

The dusty old class chat suddenly went wild.

Scrolling through the tsunami of messages, I saw it: Kennedy Jones, my middle school desk buddy, was getting hitched.

She'd invited everyone.

We were never exactly BFFs back then, and with my current corporate grind, the last thing I wanted was to RSVP yes.

""So sorry, my plate is absolutely overflowing with work right now, can't possibly make it,"" I typed, keeping it classy.

My explanation was immediately roasted.

""How swamped can you be that you can't spare a single day? It's a classmate's wedding! Are you that much of a flake?""

""She's probably just mortified to show up. C'mon, we're all ancient history here – nobody cares how much of a flop you've become.""

Kennedy even tagged me directly: ""Remember our bet on whose hubby would be the hotter commodity? Your chance to compare notes.""

I kept it real: ""Don't recall that.""

Seeing that, the sycophants piled on.

""Are you genuinely blanking, or just too shook to remember?""

""Her fiancé runs a publicly traded empire! That engagement ring was a cool ten mil, minimum!""

Kennedy then dropped the bomb: wedding pics.

And the groom? My stomach dropped.

Wasn't that... my own husband?

""Alright, since you've thrown such a fab invitation my way, I'll absolutely be there to celebrate your big day!""

Right after hitting send, a message from Sebastian popped up: ""Darling, it feels like ages since I've seen my folks.""

""Gotta pop over for a few days. I've prepped all your meals and stashed them in the fridge – just zap 'em when you're hungry.""

""Love you loads, sweetheart!""

Sebastian and I had been hitched for two and a half years. Sure, he was a big spender and clueless about business, but he was a total pro at the domestic game, doting on me 24/7.

Even on trips like this, he'd have everything I could possibly need lined up.

These little gestures used to melt me, but now? They just made me feel… nauseous.

I bailed on the rest of my meeting and blasted towards the venue Kennedy had pinned.

Traffic was a complete nightmare. I could spot the ginormous white banner from blocks away, draped over the hotel's entrance:

""Congrats to Mr. Walker, CEO of Prosperity Group, on his wedding!""

And there she was, Kennedy, in her blinding white gown, head held high, waiting for Sebastian.

My old middle school crew surrounded her.

""Kennedy, you were so hush-hush! Dropping the bombshell that you're marrying the CEO of Prosperity Group at the last minute!""

""Prosperity Group is the powerhouse of our city!""

""Seriously, Kennedy and Mr. Walker are a match made in heaven – total power couple vibes!""

""Once you're settled in with that rich family, don't forget your old pals!""

Even our old homeroom teacher was groveling: ""Kennedy, I always knew you'd conquer the world.""

""Your grades weren't top-tier, but you were always drop-dead gorgeous!""

""That's why I never busted your chops for slacking off – I even made you class president.""

Chapter 2 - The Slap of False Accusation

""My teacher said you're destined for a life of luxury, no hustle required!""

Kennedy Jones soaked up the praise from her classmates and homeroom teacher, completely unfazed.

After Sebastian Walker married me, he kept harping on about how a man needs to forge his own path to success.

I was all for it, backing his ventures with over ten million dollars.

He opened a gym, a chic coffee shop...

He even went full-on angel investor, throwing cash at all sorts of wild ideas and projects.

Unsurprisingly, every single one tanked.

But the more he failed, the more he doubled down. Then he declared he had a knack for management and wanted to run a company.

So, I handed over the keys to the smallest of my businesses, Prosperity Group, for him to play CEO.

Little did I know, this would become Sebastian's ultimate bragging right.

The moment I walked in, those same classmates who were just moments ago sucking up to Kennedy turned sour, their faces contorted with disdain.

Kennedy and I go way back, and we weren't exactly besties.

To get on Kennedy's good side, they had to put me on blast.

Just as I expected.

One of Kennedy's loyal disciples, spotting the ride behind me, swaggered over with a smirk. ""Tsk, tsk, tsk! Scarlet Greene, you're so extra!""

""Lucy's getting hitched, and here you are, trying to outshine the wedding car with your own rented whip. You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?""

""Seriously, you had to rent a Porsche just to stunt on everyone?""

The rest chimed in with their judgment.

""Figures you'd show up – just here to flex, right?""

""That rental probably cost you half your annual salary. Speaking of which, what company are you even working for these days?""

""Some people just love pretending to be someone they're not. No matter how much you flaunt, you'll never measure up to a real CEO.""

""And they have actual wealth, not you, playing dress-up with rentals!""

""Exactly, is it that hard to admit others are just better than you?""

Their mockery washed over me, but I remained unbothered. ""This is my car.""

The second I spoke, Kennedy, who had been eyeing the vehicle with suspicion, suddenly stepped in front of me.

Before I could even process what was happening, she slapped me hard across the face.

""How dare you claim this is yours? This is clearly my husband's car!""

""I always suspected some gold digger was after him, but I never thought it would be you, you trash!""

""You shameless homewrecker, how dare you show up and provoke me, the actual wife?""

The sudden impact left me reeling.

My old classmates watched, wide-eyed and clearly thrilled by the unfolding drama.

""Kennedy, that car's over two million bucks – are you sure it's Mr. Walker's?""

Kennedy puffed out her chest. ""Of course it is!""

Feeling stuck in slow-growth mode? Wishing you had a secret weapon to propel your US small business to the next level without breaking the bank? You're in the right place! In today's competitive landscape, access to the right tools can be the difference between barely surviving and absolutely thriving. We're going to dive into 5 FREE (or seriously low-cost) tools that can unlock hypergrowth for your business.

**The Challenge:**

Let's be real. Running a small business in the US is tough. You're juggling a million things at once: marketing, sales, customer service, operations, and probably making the coffee too! Often, the budget is tight, and investing in expensive software or hiring specialized help just isn't feasible. This can lead to missed opportunities, inefficient processes, and ultimately, slower growth. You might be relying on outdated methods, struggling to track performance, or missing crucial insights about your customers. The good news is, there are powerful free tools readily available that can address these challenges and give you a competitive edge.

**Supercharge Your Growth: 5 Must-Have Free Tools**

Ready to transform your business? Here’s how to leverage the power of free resources to fuel your hypergrowth:

*   **Google My Business (GMB): Claim, Optimize, and Dominate Local Search**

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:**
        1.  Claim your GMB listing if you haven't already. This is your digital storefront!
        2.  Completely fill out every section: address, phone number, website, hours, services, and description.
        3.  Upload high-quality photos of your business, products, and team.
        4.  Encourage customers to leave reviews and respond to them promptly (both positive and negative!).
        5.  Use GMB posts to share updates, promotions, and events.
    *   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** Imagine you own a local bakery. A well-optimized GMB listing will ensure you show up when someone searches ""best bakery near me."" Regularly posting about your new seasonal cupcakes will attract even more customers.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Don't neglect monitoring and responding to reviews. Even negative reviews are an opportunity to show you care about customer service. Inconsistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone number) information across the web can hurt your ranking.

*   **Canva: Design Like a Pro (Even If You're Not)**

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:**
        1.  Create a free Canva account.
        2.  Browse their extensive library of templates for social media posts, flyers, logos, presentations, and more.
        3.  Customize templates with your branding: colors, fonts, and logo.
        4.  Use their drag-and-drop interface to easily add text, images, and elements.
        5.  Download your designs in various formats for online and print use.
    *   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** Need an eye-catching Instagram ad for your upcoming sale? Canva's got you covered. Want a professional-looking presentation for a client meeting? Canva makes it easy.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Stick to a consistent brand aesthetic across all your designs. Canva's free version is powerful, but consider the paid version for more advanced features and templates if you need them.

*   **Mailchimp (Free Plan): Build Your Email List and Nurture Leads**

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:**
        1.  Sign up for Mailchimp's free plan (up to 2,000 contacts and 10,000 emails per month).
        2.  Create signup forms to collect email addresses on your website and social media.
        3.  Segment your audience based on demographics, interests, or purchase history.
        4.  Design engaging email campaigns using their templates or create your own.
        5.  Track your email open rates, click-through rates, and conversions.
    *   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** A clothing boutique can use Mailchimp to send a weekly newsletter featuring new arrivals and exclusive discounts to their subscribers.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Always get explicit consent before adding someone to your email list. Provide value in your emails to keep subscribers engaged. Monitor your spam score to avoid being flagged as spam.

*   **Google Analytics: Understand Your Website Traffic and User Behavior**

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:**
        1.  Create a Google Analytics account and connect it to your website.
        2.  Track key metrics like website traffic, bounce rate, time on site, and conversion rates.
        3.  Identify your most popular pages and content.
        4.  Understand where your website traffic is coming from (organic search, social media, referrals).
        5.  Use this data to optimize your website for better performance and user experience.
    *   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** If you notice a high bounce rate on a specific page, it might indicate that the content is irrelevant or the page is poorly designed. Analyzing traffic sources can help you focus your marketing efforts on the most effective channels.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Set up goals in Google Analytics to track specific actions you want users to take on your website, such as filling out a form or making a purchase. Don't get overwhelmed by the data; focus on the metrics that are most relevant to your business goals.

*   **Trello: Organize Your Tasks and Streamline Your Workflow**

    *   **Step-by-Step or Key Points:**
        1.  Create a free Trello account.
        2.  Create boards for different projects or aspects of your business.
        3.  Create lists within each board to represent different stages of the process (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed).
        4.  Create cards for individual tasks and assign them to team members.
        5.  Add deadlines, checklists, and attachments to your cards.
    *   **Brief Examples/Hypothetical Cases:** Use Trello to manage your content calendar, track customer support requests, or plan your next product launch.
    *   **Pro-Tip/Common Pitfalls:** Keep your boards organized and clutter-free. Use labels and color-coding to prioritize tasks. Communicate effectively with your team using Trello's commenting feature.

*   Google My Business: Free platform to manage your online presence and attract local customers.
*   Canva: Free graphic design tool for creating professional-looking visuals.
*   Mailchimp: Free email marketing platform for building your email list and sending newsletters.
*   Google Analytics: Free web analytics tool for tracking website traffic and user behavior.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Dodgers vs. Brewers NLCS Preview: A Tale of Two Pitching Staffs (and One Very Tired Shoelace)**

The 2025 NLCS kicks off with a clash of titans: the **Los Angeles Dodgers**, defending champions with the swagger of a cat that’s just claimed the sofa, and the **Milwaukee Brewers**, regular-season kings who now must prove they’re not just a “before 9 a.m.” team. Let’s break this down with the precision of a MLB umpire on his last coffee break.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The betting markets have the **Dodgers as a -1.5 run favorite**, with decimal odds hovering around **1.65 (implied probability: \~61%)**, while the Brewers check in at **\~43%** (odds: \~2.30). The total is set at **7.5 runs**, with slightly higher value on the Under—probably because Blake Snell and the Dodgers’ bullpen have combined to make “high-scoring” feel like a dirty word this postseason.

Key stat to note: The Brewers dominated the regular season, **sweeping the Dodgers 6-0**, including five games decided by two runs or fewer. But here’s the twist: **Milwaukee’s bullpen is gassed** from a Game 5 NLDS bullpen game, while the Dodgers’ relief corps—Emmet Sheehan, Alex Vesia, and Roki Sasaki—are fresh enough to start a cult.

---

### News Digest: Injuries, Roster Moves, and Shoelace Tragedies

* **Dodgers**: Blake Snell is the postseason wizard we’ve all come to love, tossing **13 innings with 18 strikeouts and just 2 runs** in two NLDS starts. Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Shohei Ohtani lurk in the rotation, while the bullpen’s “relief pitcher parade” (per manager Dave Roberts) is ready to flood the zone.
* **Brewers**: The starter mystery continues. Quinn Priester, who once struggled to pitch **more than an inning in the NLDS**, is the likely Game 1 pick. Freddy Peralta moves to Game 2, and José Quintana remains a wildcard—though his “veteran wisdom” might not help if his velocity decides to take a coffee break. The offense, led by Jackson Chourio and Brice Turang, has shown power but will face a Dodgers staff that’s **strangled NLCS hopefuls** all October.

The first hotel was incredible. The second has been plain awful. Since getting here, we learned it's recently changed owners and seriously dropped it's standards. All common areas are filthy, the pool has rubbish like bags of crisps that are left to float in it while staff looks on. They don't clean the beach (private and relatively small, so manageable).

The ""smart home"" is no longer a science fiction dream—it's becoming a reality in Kerala. Homeowners throughout the state are adopting new technologies that make daily life more convenient, energy-efficient, and secure. The transition from traditional switches to smart sensors and automated systems has changed the way people live, work, and engage with their homes. In this blog, we will see how home automation in Kerala is transforming living spaces, why it is becoming increasingly popular, and the advantages it has for modern homes.



The Rise of Smart Homes in Kerala



Kerala, famous for its greenery and urban cities, has seen a boom in the adoption of smart home technologies in the last couple of years. Cities such as Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, and Kozhikode are taking the lead, and even smaller towns are starting to adopt the comfort of smart living. Home automation in Kerala is driven by various factors:



Technological consciousness: Increasing smartphone and high-speed internet penetration has made residents more aware of the latest smart home appliances. 



Concerns about safety: House security is a concern, particularly in city suburbs, and homeowners therefore opt for security cameras, motion detectors, and smart locks.



Efficient energy use: Increasing electricity prices have led individuals to embrace solutions such as smart lighting and thermostats that maximize energy consumption.



The convergence of these elements has provided a fertile soil for the development of home automation in Kerala and has allowed residents to convert their homes into smart, responsive spaces.



From Manual Switches to Smart Sensors



Conventional houses make extensive use of hand switches to regulate lights, fans, and appliances. Although easy, this method proves to be energy-wasting and inconvenient. Contemporary houses in Kerala are now substituting these switches with smart sensors that automatically react to environmental changes or to human instructions.



Motion sensors: These sensors are used to detect movement and switch lights automatically on and off, enhancing convenience and energy efficiency. For example, a hallway motion sensor ensures the lighting is turned on only when people are walking by.



Ambient light sensors: These sensors regulate lighting according to the available natural light, eliminating unnecessary consumption of electricity.



Smart outlets and plugs: Rather than having to manually switch appliances on and off, homeowners can remotely switch them on or off using a smartphone app or through voice commands.



By stepping away from switches to sensors, Kerala homeowners are not only making their homes more convenient but also setting themselves up for completely integrated smart systems.

Voice Control: The Future of Home Interaction



One of the most exciting aspects of home automation in Kerala is voice control. Imagine waking up in the morning and saying, “Good morning,” to your smart home—and having the curtains open, the lights turn on, and the coffee maker start brewing.



Voice assistants like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit are gaining popularity in Kerala households. They allow homeowners to:



Control lights, fans, and appliances with simple voice commands



Play music or podcasts throughout the house



Set reminders, alarms, and schedules for daily routines



Control security systems and monitor surveillance cameras



Voice-enabled automation makes houses safer and more inclusive for elderly residents or people with mobility issues.



Energy Management: Saving Costs While Protecting the Planet



Kerala's warm tropical climate frequently results in high energy consumption through air conditioning and lighting. Smart home technology rectifies this by controlling energy usage, lowering electricity expenses, and lessening environmental footprint.



Major energy-saving solutions to home automation in Kerala are:



Smart thermostats: Regulate temperature automatically according to occupancy, day of the week, and weather conditions.



Automated lighting: Lights switch off when rooms are empty or adjust intensity according to surrounding light levels.



Energy monitoring systems: Offering real-time electricity consumption information, enabling homeowners to make smart decisions.



When these systems are integrated, Kerala homeowners can live comfortably while encouraging sustainability—a win-win situation for the household and the environment.



Beefing Up Home Security



Security remains a high priority for contemporary homeowners. Home automation in Kerala is increasing security through various devices and systems that leave homeowners feeling secure.



Smart locks: Support keyless entry and remote access control for homeowners.



Surveillance cameras: Monitor homes in real-time through mobile apps and alert residents to suspicious activity.



Motion and door sensors: Identify intrusions and sound alarms immediately.



Emergency services integration: Advanced systems may even automatically notify authorities in situations involving break-ins or emergencies.



These technologies guarantee that Kerala families get to live a secure home environment, even while they are away.



Smart Entertainment Systems



Kerala's smart homes are also revolutionizing entertainment. Home automation systems integrated with the home provide effortless control over home theaters, television, and music. Functions include:



Multi-room sound systems playing music in the entire house



Voice-operated streaming services



Automated curtains and lighting in sync with movie or game modes



Such control makes life more convenient and a bit luxurious for homes today.



Affordable Options and Professional Support



Although the concept of a smart home can be costly, the expense of home automation in Kerala has become affordable because of competitive costs, modular designs, and flexible payment terms. Homeowners have an option to begin small—with lighting or security—and slowly build out their smart infrastructure.



Professional maintenance and installation are also readily available. Local businesses offer consultancy, device installation, and AMC services, keeping the system running efficiently and up-to-date with new technology.



The Road Ahead



The future for home automation in Kerala is rosy. As IoT devices get smart, cheaper, and simpler to connect, more homes are likely to adopt automation in a big way. Future directions can include:



Increased AI integration for predictive automation



Improved energy management systems based on solar power



More intelligent healthcare monitoring systems for senior citizens



Sensors-controlled, fully automated kitchens and bathrooms



Kerala's adoption of smart technology is not merely about convenience; it's about developing sustainable, secure, and efficient homes that enhance the quality of life.

Conclusion



From switches to sensors, smart lighting to voice-controlled devices, [home automation in Kerala](https://qlicautomations.com/) is transforming the way people live. Today’s homes are no longer passive spaces—they are intelligent environments that respond to the needs of their occupants. The benefits are clear: enhanced convenience, improved energy efficiency, increased security, and elevated comfort.



As more Kerala homeowners become aware of the promise of smart technology, Kerala is ready to emerge as a hub for smart living. Home automation in Kerala is not only a fad; it's a move towards a future with smarter homes that are safer, more efficient, and better suited to the habits of their owners.



Kerala homeowners are no longer merely residents in homes—they are living the experience of smart, connected living. Moving away from manual switches and sensors is just the first step to a future of fully smart homes where technology becomes an integral part of daily life.",1,1760345942.0,u_DesperateObject2302,0,1.0,False

I recently bought Lavazza Crema e Aroma, and the taste with aroma improved by 500%, even with the default settings.

Please don’t use regular espresso beans for lattes — even fresh roast won’t save you. For a good latte, you need a dark (or very dark) roasted blend.

…or just get a better coffee machine. Not Philips 😜

Some of the best travel moments happen quietly, away from the usual “top 10” lists.

It’s that early morning coffee at a roadside café in Oman where locals wave as you pass.  
Or that night sky in the desert, where you realize silence has its own kind of beauty.  
Maybe it’s exploring an old souk in Sharjah, where time seems to move more slowly.

Underrated destinations often give you something that mainstream spots can’t, which is **authenticity**. They’re less about “doing” and more about *feeling*. You connect with people, stories, and landscapes that don’t try to impress you; they just exist, beautifully unfiltered.

From the fjords of Musandam to the hidden wadis of Fujairah, the Middle East is full of places that deserve more love than they get.

So, I’m curious —

After looking around for a super automatic I have narrowed down to Eletta cappuccino(fully automatic) or Dinamica (frothing wand). 

Wanted to get some opinion on which one to go for as some reviews saying fully automatic doesn’t produce high temperature milk so the coffee is lukewarm. 

My go to coffee is a flat white, which machine will produce the best frothing myself (not much experience) or fully automatic.

Thanks advance!

I want to begin by expressing my gratitude to this sub and all the friends I made here who have helped me in the last one year. I have divided this post into little backstory (finding loa, Neville and realizing why law is indeed real), m
My learnings, Successes I experienced, and techniques used.

Backstory: I am 27, right now and for almost twelve years of my life I have been ridden with depression, felt lonely and isolated, was victim to my circumstances because of it. Three years ago, I moved to EU from my home country and experienced horrible health crisis, went bankrupt, failed my exams, broke up with my man whom I dated for almost six years and was just practically alone and secluded in my room, suicidal for seven months (all of this happened in 2023 simultaneously). 
For first half of 2024, I was simply putting out fires and in therapy, until my man told me there is someone else now and I failed my finals proceeding with me getting kicked out of my program. I wanted to be a writer and during those days I came really close to publishing my poetry collection and even paid deposit to a publication but it turned out to be fraud and I lost money and my heart was crushed.

This was it. This was the point wherein I decided this is not the life I want to live. Things got to change. I was completely lost. I believed when I was 13 that I am going to be successful, loved and happy in my adulthood and I was completely lost and losing it in my mid 20s already despite living half of my dream of living abroad. 

On the same day (17 July 2024, yes I remember the day!), I looked into Manifestation sub, followed by Law of Attraction then Assumption, then Neville Goddard. I got into teachings of Joe Dispenza, Sammy Ingram, Erik (Power of I am) and most importantly I started reading Bhagvad Gita. 


My Learnings: 

Many people who come on this sub for most part come to manifest something which THEY BELIEVE IS OUTSIDE OF THEM. 
this is the key to it all - the Belief that it is outside of you. 

One of the early most post I read  in Law of Assumption or its application was to 
1. Identify your wounds/triggers. IDENTIFY. 
Identity to know what you believe yourself in the moment, to what you reveal about yourself. 
It's important because it shows you exactly where the north of your compass is. 

“Change your conception of yourself and you will automatically change the world in which you live. Do not try to change people; they are only messengers telling you who you are.” — Neville Goddard


2. For the first two months, I simply understood and recognise all my negative thoughts and beliefs and worked heavily on my self concept. I created a story , a small scene of talking to a friend on how to heal depression. It maybe similar to Visualization or Scripting but tbh, i didn't do it perfectly but I just did. Key was my own belief that I am someone who can give advice on it and people will believe me because they see the change in me. Meaning i have changed. 

“Assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled and continue feeling it until that which you feel objectifies itself.” — Neville Goddard, Feeling is the Secret.

For all the, which technique wonderers - IT TRULY DOESN'T MATTER. it boils down to you and your belief. Your story. The medium of the story is irrelevant. Only the story is. And story can change per the will of the writer, any time, any day.

3. In 2025, I experienced a lot of 3d setbacks within first three months was even more lost. My visa was ending and I was struggling physically this time. I revised all I learned but I go into the nitty gritty beyond the 3d and our desires aspect through Gita. 

I want to emphasize, I have read Bible and few texts from other religious texts, I am from Science background and I believe in God but I also question it's existence and existence of Universe itself but honestly from everything I have read  and studied it all points to the concrete fact that Life comes from us. We give it meaning. Because in truth Life is meaningless, random, and nothingness. 

It's our own thoughts, ego, mind, beliefs, senses which create a picture. As without, so within, so without, so within...its endless.

And Gita, primarily, made me realize that a man is bound to his ego, which binds our thoughts and knowledge, which binds our beliefs and which binds our senses and which shows in 3d. That's all. Once we see beyond our ego. We realize there exists an observer beyond ego. We see god. And we are god. 
And if you look at it scientifically, we all come from atoms. So we are creation of the same unit. You, world around you, your desires are atoms and part of the same mixture as you. 

“You are already that which you want to be, and your refusal to believe it is the only reason you do not see it.” — Neville Goddard

There is nothing away from you.
It's a belief which took months to get rooted in my belief. But it's a truth I return to now every time.

Also, truth of detachment. Detachment is not being unbothered or ignoring or pretending to not care. Detachment is freeing yourself. It is freedom from everything we allow to govern us. Meaning freedom from your desire. The desperation the need the reason of wanting it ceases to exist because you're not trapped by your senses anymore.

It is or it is not but you are . And if you are ,so it it is.

All this learnings led me to my successes:
1. Within starting in 2023, my therapy improved. I made few new friends and I became someone who admired Nature. I became calmer within weeks. Around two months in, one of my friends told me that it feels so much calmer to be around me now. A week later, a friend I hadn't talked to and ended on bad terms with reached out after four years and we reconciled and became best friends again in a month. 
My scene of explaining how depression works and how to heal came true thrice with three different friends.

2. I affirmed that things work out for me as my umbrella Affirmations. And over time. My father's business boomed in early 2024 and he lend me money to pay my debt. It was a huge amount and medical bill. But I received money from my friends as a contest prize for my writing as well.

3. I was lost and in a dead end career for years. And felt shameful of my career which contributed to my failure in masters program. A month before failing I attended a conference on machine learning and it's application in medical fields especially mental health and women endocrine systems and I was thrilled and found my purpose. I looked into it and started studying.

Even after dropping out, I continued to apply for jobs and received two internship. Even now a job in my home country, paying me 5 figure a month and admission to a masters program in my dream city to restart studies this time in a field I am seeing my future in and am more aligned with. 

4. I had given up on writing but I started writing again after 10 months on Substack and now I have over 500 subscribers and millions of ideas to write more and more. I recently acquired an agent as well 

5. My relationship with my man is improving. I realized everything was created by me. We haven't reconciled yet. But yesterday, I found out he broke up. I also realized he is my mirror. Probably the most accurate one. I retraced my memories as I changed my beliefs and I saw him reflect them every time we talked. When we had a conversation last time, I did so to gain closure and to free him to be happy with whomever (it was a bad day ngl). But he proceeded to tell me that he knows this isn't the last time we are talking and our paths will cross once more... and while our paths haven't crossed yet, I know it is going to.

6. My relationship with myself improved. I don't remember being depressed, anxious or anything ever. I get complimented by my people and everyone tells me they admire me so much. I hated sports all my life but now I not only go to gym daily but I am training as a boxer. I live my life as of a boxer with discipline and courage. And this is a big one because, my relationship with food was one which caused me a lot of pain since my school life. I was bullied then over my weight. 

And my refusal to be that trapped girl is what making me work hard and be proud everyday. I learnt about human body and am losing fat and gaining strength and command over my body each day. 

My life took a 175 in an year. 175 because I know there's more to come haha.

Lastly, my techniques:

 Learning what manifesting, life, Neville's lectures especially Faith is fortune, Gita and everything I mentioned. All of them contributed. But personally, understanding what life is? That question opened avenues to appreciate life in small and big ways.

My ultimate fav - “Faith is loyalty to the unseen reality.” — Neville Goddard, Faith is Your Fortune

But practically, 
1. Affirmations, 3-4 personal ones. Short like I am chosen. I am safe. I am grateful. As well as 2-3 umbrella like Everything works out for me. I am all that is. 
During the beginning, I affirmed with a timer thrice a day for ten minutes. I said them out loud.

2. Tapes - I created desires affs tapes. Basically, a. miracles and I recorded myself saying I received it all. My life is magic etc. and then played it all night while sleeping. I created several such each of 2-3 minutes and put it on loop...
Subconscious conditioning is magic. I woke up feeling a different person several times in these years. Almost forgetting what was.

3. Scripting/Visualizing when I am not desperate or want to change 3d. I used to script or imagine when i saw something unpleasant. This emphasized the lack and my need to fill it. So I stopped that. I only script and visualise when I suddenly miss someone or wondered what am I gonna do or be in two three months and I script something inconsequential.

Before receiving a call back for my internship I imagined wearing formals in the mirror before sleeping. Next morning I saw the same shirt on my shopping app and I added to cart and debated buying when I haven't received any offer. But I still did for fun of it all. And an hour later I got the offer letter.
With my bf, I wondered him teasing me that I have a gym trainer when he could be mine too. And it's one of my favourite scenes to think of him.

Don't be heavy on the how and write endless stories. Rather focus on being the character in that story. 

4. Lastly, returning to basics in doubt I have a playlist of all my favourite manifestation videos I watch them as often. I feel grateful every day, even on my shittiest day which makes me appreciate as small as a pretty leaf or even a bad coffee on days. I live my life and meaning I am thrilled by life and what all there is to discover and learn. When I say, I read it all and come to the same truth of what life is, I mean it and you can find it for yourself too.

“Dare to believe in the reality of your assumption and watch the world play its part relative to its fulfillment.” — Neville Goddard

In gita, it is said that Humans primarily operate from two roots. One of love and one of fear.
All beautiful things and virtues are children of love. Hard work is love for the work. Knowledge is love for the wonder. Empathy is love for humans. Etc.

Similarly all negative virtues are children of fear. Insecurity is fear of being left our, heartbreak is fear of thinking our heart is breakable by a single moment or a person, ego is fear of being overlooked.

“No effort on the path of self-realization is ever wasted, and no gain is ever lost.” — Bhagavad Gita 2.40

These all made me realise that it al comes down to fear. So whenever I feel anything I remind myself it's fear. And I ask myself, what's to fear? Is it really something to be afraid of? And answer is always No.

Gloria in late December had the feeling of a country holding its breath. The skyline that once pulsed with traffic and laughter now looked bruised — checkpoints at intersections, banners in another language, armored vehicles rolling slow like they were testing the patience of the whole city.

Sometimes, when I passed through the central boulevard, I still remembered how it used to sound — vendors shouting over the hum of buses, the smell of roasted peanuts and rain-washed asphalt. Now the same street was silent except for the hum of engines and the occasional barked order through a megaphone.

Rain hadn’t fallen for weeks, but the air was heavy, as if the sky itself mourned.

I sat on the living-room couch with a closed engineering textbook on my knee. Civil engineering was my course; the drawings and formulas were what I came back to night after night because they were a map of future certainties. I had a plan, or wanted one — to leave a name behind. Not a fleeting mark, but a legacy. I wanted to build something that would make the world remember me long after I was gone.

My cousin Raikou lay on the floor across from me. Two years younger, always quicker to laugh, always restless in a way that made me both proud and uneasy. He was flipping a coin — the same tarnished coin he’d carried since childhood — catching it with the same rhythm every time. He once said it brought him luck. Lately, I think he just liked having control over something that still obeyed his hand.

“Imagine not waking up here anymore,” he said without looking up. “Just… gone. A proper escape.”

He spoke quietly, but the sentence landed like a decision. The occupation had hardened into a daily reality — public radio announcing curfews, foreign troops patrolling markets, and every small freedom measured against a new rule. Saying the word leave was no longer theater; it was survival.

I told him it was reckless. I told him the obvious things: the coast was watched, the borders were closed, the harbor was a line of metal teeth. But when Raikou fixed me with his usual impatient half-smile, I heard in his voice a resolve I couldn’t ignore.

“We either live our lives under someone else’s orders,” he said, “or we find a way the occupiers didn’t expect.”

The laugh that rose between us was thin — not humor, but defiance. The kind of laugh that acknowledges danger and chooses it anyway.

For weeks, the idea became a private code. We catalogued possibilities — boats we might find, unguarded routes, familiar faces in the market who might help if we dared to ask. People said the ports were sealed. People lied for comfort. We listened and filed every contradiction like a list of exits.

One night in March, at a small internet café run by Mr. Aymen — a man who brewed coffee strong enough to mask despair — Raikou and I sat beneath a flickering screen. The television looped the same images: barricades, foreign officers, the same city learning to speak less each day.

“You hear about the convoy?” Mr. Aymen muttered to a customer, too loudly for the room. “They move at night now. They move like they own the dark.”

Raikou leaned closer. “There are gaps,” he whispered. “Gaps that close, but only sometimes. A person who knows how to wait sees them.”

I nodded. Waiting, measuring, precision — the tools of an engineer. And perhaps, of an escape.

By May, the idea had stopped being a joke. Raikou had been saving for weeks — folded bills in an old tin, coins tucked in his shoes. He spoke less, smiled less. The restlessness in him had turned into direction.

One morning, I woke to find him already dressed, bag in hand. His coin rested on the table — as if luck was no longer needed.

“You coming?” he asked.

No speech. No plea. Just the quiet certainty that if I said no, we would never meet again.

That night, the coast was a black line beneath a darker sky. Twelve faces met us there — strangers with the same tired determination. A single patched boat waited, stripped of everything but purpose. There were no flags, no papers; only the resolve of those who refused to be counted.

I looked at the sea and felt how small we were. The water stretched out like an unspoken history, swallowing names too heavy to carry.

“Are you afraid?” I asked Raikou.

He shrugged. “Everything we had is gone. This is the unwritten map.”

We stepped onto the boat together.

When the oars dipped into the water, the coast began to fade. The city shrank behind us, its dim lights trembling like memories that didn’t want to die. We had not chosen adventure. We had chosen necessity.

The motor growled, then softened to a hum. For hours, we drifted through darkness thick enough to erase direction. The air grew colder, metallic. Prayers filled the silence, whispered by lips that knew no more of faith than of geography.

Then, the engine began to choke.

The old guide — a man whose name none of us ever learned — raised a hand. “We’re here,” he said.

No one spoke.

Fog rolled in, silver and slow, swallowing everything in reach. There was no coastline. No horizon. Only the sound of our breath and the lapping of water that felt too still, too deliberate.

Raikou leaned forward. “What do you mean… here?”

The guide didn’t blink. “The place you were meant to reach,” he said. His voice carried no emotion — only finality.

He turned off the engine. The boat drifted.

The air smelled of iron and rain that never fell.

I felt the weight of my ambition then — all the structures I had wanted to build, the name I hoped to leave behind — and wondered if I had just stepped into a kind of history no one ever returns from.

Raikou met my gaze. “Is this… the other side?”

Before I could answer, the fog moved — not like mist, but like something alive, drawing itself apart.

And that’s when I realized: We hadn’t escaped. We had arrived somewhere that didn’t want to be found.",1,1760344815.0,AlgeriaRates,0,0.6,False

1.      Suppose I start here: I think I loved a secret more than I loved the boy who kept it. Or maybe the secret *was* the boy. Is that too simple? Suppose I admit this necklace – green, dense, faintly humming – became the locus of that confusion. Worn right here, between the collarbones. A bruise made permanent.

2.      Saw a science program once. Some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds formed through interstellar collisions. Imagine. Beauty born from celestial violence.

3.      I trace the edge with my nail. Again. A nervous habit, maybe Its resilience reminds me of certain silences.  The mineral stubbornness pressing lines into my skin.

4.      His earnestness, a fragile shield against… what? Did we even know then? Just boys and girls playing dress-up with emotions too big for us. The necklace felt like part of that costume; a necessary ballast.

5.      I can remember pressing it hard against my skin often. Feeling the coolness, then the warmth leaching from my own body into the stone. What was I trying to do? Absorb it? Understand it by touch? A small, stupid ritual against the larger unknowns.

6.      Reading mother’s diary felt like this, too. Pressing my face against the page, trying to inhale her handwriting. Was I trying to *be* her? Or just prove I existed outside the shadow of the crash? The necklace, fragment of that same fire, felt like evidence. Exhibit A: Girl Tethered to Tragedy. Its green glow, a sickly nightlight against the darkness of her absence.

7.      He smelled of sun and hay and something else. Something electric, unsettling. Like the air before a storm. *This time, Lana.* His eyes would plead. My pulse, a trapped bird against the stone.

8.      Suppose I admit it: my primary orientation is towards a piece of rock. I love blue, but the world seems to be saturated with green. A point of cold pressure just below my throat. Sometimes I forget it's there, until I shift wrong, or the chain catches—a sharp pull against the ordinary fabric of the day. An inescapable weight.

9.       I read that Meteorites carry traces of amino acids. Building blocks of life. Here, they brought death. And this fragment I wore? It seemed to carry the echo of their love. A building block of distance. Is that life?

10.  Performance becomes second nature in a town like Smallville. The Smile. The Tilt of the Head. The Appropriate Level of Grief. The Necklace was part of that uniform. I remember catching its reflection in the window of the Talon, superimposed over my own face. Which was the mask?

11.   She catches me touching the stone again. A flicker in her stare—not judgment, just… always noticing. My thumb hides the green. But she’s already turning away. What did she see? A souvenir, or the scar; maybe just the chaotic green I wear.

12.   Are the hinges of my apartment made of glass?  The coffee shop was supposed to be a serene space. It’s more like diorama of my entrapment: I’m like both prisoner and exhibit, serving lattes in a cage dressed as a Nilotic sanctuary.

13.  Is it a sin to crave the texture of truth? Even if it's cold, sharp-edged? This stone doesn’t lie. Its green simply *is*. Unlike the shifting landscapes in people’s eyes, the careful architecture of their smiles. This weight, at least, feels constant. But maybe that’s the biggest lie of all – mistaking mineral silence for honesty. My own pathetic fallacy.

14.  Is it possible to get used to poison? A low dose, every day, until your body doesn't register the sickness, just the constant unease. Until the green glow feels like normal light.

15.  What do you do when the person you love causes you physical pain, just by being near what defines *you*?

16.  Paris had soft light. Grey stone that absorbed sound. Stood before Monet’s Nymphéas for an hour. All that blue felt like a different planet. Could barely remember the colour green. A lie, of course. You never forget the feel of the cage.

17.  Took it off. Placed it in a cedar box my aunt had made years ago. The sudden lightness felt wrong. Like an amputation.

18.  People talk about scars fading. Does embedded radiation fade? Or does it just become part of your cellular makeup, indistinguishable from the self? You carry the source within. Removal doesn't guarantee decontamination.

19.  From the sky-fire that took them. My parents. And I wear it. Daily. Is this piety, or a kind of morbid map-making? An attempt to trace the coordinates of absence, right here, against my own skin.

20.  The Cafe. My messy, imperfect try at something real. Coffee grounds on the floor, the clatter of mugs. Then he would walk in, and the air would thicken. The green stone, even tucked under my shirt, felt suddenly loud. A tuning fork for his evasions. He'd promise. *This time, Lana.* And the stone felt like a lie detector against my own pulse. Steady, knowing beat: *No.*

21.  Is memory just choosing which bruises to press on? Over and over...or am I? This one is—cool and green; perpetually tender.

22.  He once gave me a rare orchid. Perfect, waxy petals. Unreal. He said its particular shade reminded him of my eyes. I think it reminded him of the necklace. Something beautiful, cultivated, and containable. Something he could eventually own.

23.  I confess I have built a life around a piece of green stone. A shard collected from the wreckage. It rests against my sternum now, always cool. They say remember the those we lost.  Suppose I admitted that some days, the coldness of it feels less like memory, more like the core of the loneliness itself.

24.  The feeling of the chain, thin against the skin on my neck. Sometimes catching a strand of hair. A tiny, persistent irritation. A reminder.  
  
25.  Sometimes, it’s just green. Dull jade in the shade. Other times, caught in a certain light, it seems to pulse. A faint, unhealthy viridescence leaking out. Like poison trying to pass as jewel. Like a secret held so tight it glows.

26.  A man out by Hob's Pond swore he saw lights fall the night of the shower. Said they hummed a tune. People called him crazy. Maybe. Or maybe just observant.  
  
27.  Do memories attach themselves to objects? Or do objects become anchors for the storm inside? Pressing the cool green stone against my temple. Trying to still the thoughts. A futile exercise. Like trying to map fog.

 28.  Authenticity? Tried to find it in textbooks, in relationships, in independence. Is it something you find? Or something you are granted?

29.  That hard, phosphorescent green. The color of this rock, yes. But also oscilloscope screens. Digital rain in *The Matrix*. An unnatural energy. A signal from somewhere else, disrupting everything.

30.  He arrived with answers. Not truths, perhaps, but answers. Plausible surfaces. Explanations like smooth, cool stones skipping over the murky depths Clark navigated. Lex didn’t carry a secret like a burden; he wielded secrets like tools. Or weapons.

31.  Hold it up to the window on a rainy day. Does stone absorb sorrow? It just refracts the gray light, dense and mute. I read somewhere about rocks holding magnetic memory. Perhaps this piece remembers the fire, the speed, the impact. Maybe I touch it hoping for transmission. A jolt of clarity. Am I simply assigning narrative weight to a random piece of cosmic debris?

32.  Does the green fade? Or just seep deeper into the bloodstream? Still waiting for an answer.

33.  That necklace, that small green thing, made his proximity agony. Think about that. Love as proximity-induced pain. The green glow, the color of an impossible equation.

34.  A snag. The chain catches on the wool of my sweater. Just a tiny, routine friction. And suddenly: the linoleum floor of the hospital, the smell of antiseptic, the sticky green soap in the dispenser. *That* green. This stone didn't create the feeling, it just gave it a locus. Something tangible to wear around my neck, a portable memento of the moment the world cracked.

35.  To find oneself irrevocably altered. Choiceless. Defined by an event, carrying its physical remnant. Its muteness. That is the point, perhaps. A constant, quiet assertion of the rupture. Maybe this uncomfortable persistence is the closest thing to truth I possess.

36.  My fingers find it without thinking. Stress, uncertainty, a sudden chill—the familiar smooth shape; the outline of its mineral stubbornness.

37.  How to describe this control? Not chains. More like… altering the magnetic poles. So all your compasses point toward him. Even your own body, a traitor collaborating with the narrative he spun. Phantom life. Sickeningly precise.

38.  His pain. A physical thing. A barrier woven into the fabric of the town, the air, the necklace. My closeness was agony for him. Love measured in excruciating proximity. Green was the color of that impossible space between us.

39.  What is this compulsion to touch it? Trace its edges until my fingerprint smudges its surface? Not like wanting Clark, the heat of that. No. This is different. A desperate, almost geological curiosity. What would happen if I put it in my mouth? Let the cold strangeness dissolve on my tongue? The *wanting* is there- Is it a strange thought? To integrate it somehow. To understand its alien indifference from the inside out.

40.  To want truth so badly you’d tear the world apart for it. Then realize you might be tearing yourself apart instead.

41.  Trust erodes like sandstone. Faster here. Each lie, each evasion, not a hammer blow, but water dripping. Persistent. Inescapable. You wake up one day and the foundation is just… gone. Replaced by suspicion. That hard, watchful green.

42.  Is it perverse to think I’d miss the weight of it now? The certainty of that specific pain? At least it was a map. A known territory of hurt.

43.  He made the lies physical, undeniable. Cellular. Suddenly the necklace seemed like a childish token. A surface secret. Lex dealt in biological truths, rewritten realities. His deception wasn't a weight; it was an infection. The green I wore felt clean compared to that invisible violation.

44.  I took it off. Put it in a box. Felt like burying a part of myself. The part that waited. The part that believed, maybe, that truth was graspable, solid like stone. It’s more like a tear now than jade stone.

45.  Loneliness can make you mistake control for comfort. I know that now.

46.  Heavier than stone, the weight of what it represented. The unsaid. The perpetually deferred truth. You get used to carrying it, adjust your posture. Until one day you try to stand straight without it and find you’ve forgotten how.

47.  Am I just cataloging grievances? Polishing the stone of my own hurt? Perhaps. But understanding the shape of the cage is the first step, isn't it? Even if you can't find the key.

48.  Sometimes, I dream in green. Not the soft green of new leaves. The hard, phosphorescent green of trapped energy. Of things that fell from a great height and shattered everything. It doesn't fade. That color. It just finds new surfaces to stain.",1,1760344806.0,notgoodphilosophy,0,1.0,False

The idea was simple — most loofahs look boring and wear out after a few washes, so why not make them fun, quirky and durable?

Right now, I’m doing everything myself — from packaging and handling orders to trying to market it online. It’s been a mix of excitement and chaos but seeing people actually enjoy the product makes it worth it.

The world felt heavy, and every morning was just another day to survive.

Then I started a simple ritual: every morning, I would brew one cup of coffee and tell myself one small story of resilience while it steeped. At first, it was just going through the motions - grinding the beans, boiling the water, watching the steam rise. But something shifted around day 30.

That daily coffee became my anchor. The 10 minutes it took to brew and drink became my sacred space to remember that even in my brokenness, there was still beauty in small rituals. The stories I told myself - sometimes about historical figures, sometimes about ordinary people, sometimes just memories of my own better days - started stitching me back together.

Three months later, those coffee moments have become the foundation of my healing. I started recording these stories, and they've become my channel ""One Coffee, One Story"" - not because I'm an expert, but because I learned that sometimes the smallest rituals can hold the biggest healing.

**The lesson that changed everything for me:** Your comeback doesn't have to be dramatic. It can be as simple as showing up for one cup of coffee, one story, one day at a time.

Here's one story that particularly helped me: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRXd6aDGfqk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRXd6aDGfqk)

Quick Overview

X-Design is an AI agent for branding design.

Instead of generating random images, it tries to understand your concept and create real usable brand assets.

You describe your idea, your story, your business name, or even upload a sketch. The system then produces a full logo and brand guide.

What makes it interesting is that it does not stop at the logo. It automatically builds a color palette, font pairing, and layout rules, all organized into a shareable brand guide.

My Early Impressions

I ran a few small tests such as a coffee shop and a gym brand concept. The results were surprisingly coherent. The AI seems to interpret tone and vibe fairly well. The logos were editable and consistent across different layouts.

It is not perfect. Sometimes the typography choices feel too safe or generic, but for early stage brand exploration it saves a lot of time.

What I Am Curious About

Has anyone here tried AI driven branding tools

How close do you think AI can get to capturing the soul of a brand from a short description

Would you trust an AI to design your first logo or brand kit

For designers, does this feel more like a helpful starting point or a possible disruption

It feels like we are getting closer to a point where ideas can become full brand systems in minutes instead of weeks. I am curious how others feel about this shift.

Note: I am not affiliated with X-Design. Just testing the AI branding agent and would like to hear different perspectives.",1,1760344145.0,AIToolTesting,0,1.0,False

Instead, every day feels like a loop: same desk, same screen, same microwave lunch. I don’t even leave my apartment some days.  It’s not burnout exactly, I like my job, but it’s this quiet sense of repetition that’s slowly draining me.  I miss small talk with coworkers, random coffee breaks, even the dumb office birthdays.  

How do you keep your remote routine from becoming... static? I’ve tried co-working spaces, but somehow it still feels like I’m living the same day over and over.",0,1760343561.0,remotework,15,0.42,False
