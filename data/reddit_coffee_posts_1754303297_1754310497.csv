1mhc0nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInReviews/comments/1mhc0nk/uncover_the_truth_is_the_drinkmate_omnifizz_the/,Uncover the Truth: Is the DrinkMate OmniFizz the Best Soda Maker?,"When I first got my hands on the DrinkMate 410-02-14Zx4, I couldn’t wait to dive into the world of fizzy drinks. With its promise to carbonate just about anything, this soda maker intrigued me right from the start. Naturally, I had to put its capabilities to the test, and, after countless experiments, it’s safe to say I’ve formed a love-hate relationship with it.

**Design That Fits Anywhere**

Aesthetically, this carbonation machine is quite the stunner. The sleek matte black finish gives it a modern and premium look, blending into my kitchen seamlessly. It has a compact footprint, so it didn’t take over my counter space, which is at a premium in my apartment. The manual operation is a double-edged sword—it saves you from worrying about cords and outlets but does demand a bit more effort. The stainless steel build feels durable, but I did notice that fingerprints tend to linger a bit, requiring regular cleaning to maintain its chic appearance.

**Innovative Technology Packed In**

What truly sets it apart is the patented Fizz Infuser technology. This feature slowly releases pressure from the bottle, making it safe and easy to carbonate beverages without any unexpected spurts or leaks. Unlike traditional soda makers that stick to water, this system embraces creativity. I’ve carbonated everything from fresh orange juice to cold brew coffee, and even flat soda. The bubbles were consistent, and the flavor remained intact, which is a significant victory for any home carbonation enthusiast—seriously, carbonated iced tea is a game-changer. 

**Check DrinkMate 410-02-14Zx4 price on Amazon.**

**Performance for Everyday Usability**

Performance-wise, this machine gets a solid thumbs-up. The four 60L CO2 cylinders included can produce up to 240 liters of carbonated beverages. Considering I often host gatherings and love experimenting with different fizzy concoctions, these cylinders lasted longer than I initially expected. The carbonation levels were customizable—light fizz for juices or an intense sparkle for mocktails—which added a layer of flexibility. However, it takes a bit of trial and error to find the perfect carbonation level for beverages beyond water.

**Winning Points**

- The compact and attractive design suits any kitchen décor.  
- Patented Fizz Infuser handles pressure safely while carbonating diverse liquids.  
- Comes with four CO2 cylinders, offering significant value and longevity.  
- The carbonation levels are customizable for varied preferences.  

**Caveats**

- It requires frequent cleaning to avoid lingering odors, especially after carbonating drinks like wine or tea.  
- Fingerprint smudges are a constant battle on the stainless steel surface.  
- The manual operation demands some effort, which might not suit everyone.  

**Competing Brands**

Looking at similar options, the SodaStream lineup is an obvious comparison. SodaStream models offer electric-powered alternatives, which might appeal to those who prefer low-effort operation. While their machines are reliable and efficient, they mainly focus on carbonating water. This is where the DrinkMate shines. The flexibility to carbonate any beverage—including cocktails and juices—gives it a decisive edge. Additionally, SodaStream users often have to tackle proprietary CO2 cylinders, whereas the DrinkMate allows compatibility with standard options using adapters, proving itself to be the more versatile choice.

Another contender, the Aarke Carbonator, boasts a stylish stainless steel design. However, its higher price tag and limited use with only water make it less appealing for those who want to explore creative drinks. Between these three, DrinkMate has found a sweet spot by balancing affordability, versatility, and ease of use.

**Budget-Friendly Sparkles**

From a value perspective, this product delivers a lot for its price. The inclusion of reusable BPA-free bottles, the sturdy design, and, of course, four CO2 cylinders make it an enticing investment. Considering how much it saves on buying pre-made sparkling drinks, it’s easy to justify purchasing one, especially if you’re tired of the recurring expense of canned seltzers or want to reduce waste. Additionally, its ability to carbonate beyond plain water means no drink gets left behind. There’s clear long-term savings here if you’re someone who regularly enjoys effervescent beverages.

1mhbzho,https://i.redd.it/0zcgadcywzgf1.jpeg,Margo and Marce is a Retro Typeface That Feels Like a Conversation,"In a digital world built on sharp vectors and flawless grids, a quiet revolution is taking place. Designers and brands are consciously turning towards aesthetics that feel more human, more personal, and more authentic. This movement finds its perfect expression in the [Margo and Marcel](https://weandthecolor.com/margo-and-marcel-font-komet-flicker/205001) font, a hand-drawn retro typeface from Komet & Flicker. This isn't just another font; it's a deliberate choice to infuse warmth and personality into design. With its charming, all-caps style and a friendly, down-to-earth vibe, **Margo and Marcel** provides a powerful tool for anyone looking to create a genuine connection with their audience.

# The Anatomy of a Friendly Typeface

What gives **Margo and Marcel** its distinctive and approachable character? The magic lies in its thoughtful construction, which prioritizes personality over sterile perfection. It’s a study in how intentional imperfections can create a more engaging visual experience.

At its core, **Margo and Marcel** is defined by its hand-drawn origins. Each letter was individually crafted, resulting in the subtle inconsistencies and organic shapes that machines cannot replicate. This quality makes the font feel relatable and sincere. Think of it as the typographic equivalent of a friendly, handwritten note left on a colleague's desk. Consequently, it bypasses the formal, corporate feel of many standard fonts and instead communicates with a disarming warmth. This inherent personality makes the typeface feel truly unique.

Komet & Flicker elevated **Margo and Marcel** beyond a simple A-Z character set. Its creative flexibility is significantly enhanced by a few key additions. The font includes alternate versions for eight different characters (C, G, I, J, K, Q, R, and S). This allows a designer to manually swap out letters to avoid conspicuous repetition, giving text a more custom, hand-lettered appearance.

Furthermore, the inclusion of 20 pre-designed connecting words like ""AND,"" ""THE,"" and ""WITH"" is a game-changer. These glyphs are crafted to link words together fluidly, strengthening the illusion of bespoke lettering and adding a layer of professional polish to the casual aesthetic.

# Why Margo and Marcel is a Strategic Design Choice

A font does more than present words; it establishes an emotional tone. The decision to use the **Margo and Marcel** font is a strategic one, aimed at building a specific kind of relationship with an audience.

For new and established brands alike, cultivating an approachable identity is crucial for building trust. **Margo and Marcel** is perfectly suited for this task. Its friendly nature makes it an excellent choice for businesses that want to feel accessible and authentic. Imagine it on the packaging for artisanal coffee, the logo for a boutique clothing store, or the website for a creative professional. The font immediately signals craftsmanship, care, and a human-first philosophy that deeply resonates with today's consumers.

On crowded digital platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, or even in email newsletters, capturing attention requires more than a good photo. The typography needs to be compelling. The charming and legible nature of **Margo and Marcel** makes it ideal for creating shareable graphics, video thumbnails, and engaging headlines. Its warmth feels less like advertising and more like a friendly recommendation, which can dramatically improve user engagement and shareability.

# How to Master the Margo and Marcel Font

Unlocking the full potential of this typeface means knowing how to use its special features. The process is straightforward in modern design software.

To use the alternate characters and connecting words, you need to open the Glyphs panel in your design program of choice.

* **For Adobe Illustrator users:** Navigate to the main menu and select ""Type → Glyphs."" A panel will appear showing every character and ligature available in the **Margo and Marcel** font.
* **For Adobe Photoshop users:** The process is nearly identical. Go to ""Type → Panels → Glyphs Panel"" to open the same interface.

From this panel, you can simply double-click any glyph to insert it directly into your active text layer.

The applications for this font are incredibly broad. Consider these long-tail keyword ideas for inspiration:

* **Best approachable retro typeface for logos:** Use **Margo and Marcel** to design a logo that feels both timeless and welcoming.
* **How to create friendly branding with an all-caps font:** Explore its use in a full brand suite, from business cards to social media templates.
* **Custom hand-drawn font for restaurant menus:** Craft a menu that conveys a warm, inviting dining experience before the first dish is even ordered.
* **Using font alternates for a custom-lettered look:** Experiment with the different character versions to make headlines and titles feel truly one-of-a-kind.

# The Verdict: Margo and Marcel's Enduring Appeal

Ultimately, the **Margo and Marcel** font is more than a fleeting design trend. It represents a significant shift towards more authentic, human-centric communication. Its strength lies in its ability to feel both professionally designed and deeply personal at the same time. For designers, marketers, and brand builders who want to create work that connects, engages, and feels genuinely sincere, **Margo and Marcel** is not just a good choice—it is an essential tool.

## Key Features Analysis

The key features of fudge bar ice cream revolve around its ingredients, texture, and nutritional profile. These factors contribute significantly to the overall taste and enjoyment of the product.

**Ingredients:** The quality of ingredients is crucial for a delicious fudge bar.

most commercially available fudge bars use a combination of milk, cream, sugar, and cocoa as their base. However, premium brands ofen incorporate higher-quality cocoa powders, real vanilla extract, and less processed sugars, resulting in a richer and more authentic chocolate flavor. Some brands also add stabilizers and emulsifiers to improve texture and prevent ice crystal formation during storage. Always check the ingredient list if you have any allergy restrictions.

**texture:** A smooth and creamy texture is highly desirable in a fudge bar.

The presence of ice crystals can detract from the overall experience, so manufacturers employ various techniques to achieve a consistent and velvety texture. These methods include using smaller ice crystal formation through rapid freezing. higher fat content also contributes to a creamier mouthfeel, while ingredients like guar gum and carrageenan help to maintain the desired consistency.**Cocoa Content and Flavor Profile:** The intensity and complexity of the chocolate flavor are primary criteria.

Different brands use varying amounts and types of cocoa powder, resulting in distinctly different flavor profiles. Some bars have a deep, dark chocolate flavor, while others are sweeter and milkier. The addition of other flavorings, such as vanilla or coffee, can further enhance the overall taste experience.**Nutritional Information:** Consumers are increasingly conscious of the nutritional content of their food.

Fudge bars generally contain calories, sugar, and fat. However, the specific amounts vary depending on the brand and formulation. Some manufacturers offer lower-sugar and lower-fat versions to cater to health-conscious consumers.Others prioritize using natural and organic ingredients, appealing to those seeking cleaner labels.

**Packaging and Size:** The packaging should be functional, and the size of the bar should be appropriate.

Fudge bars are typically sold individually wrapped or in multi-packs.The packaging material should protect the bars from freezer burn and physical damage. The size of the bar can also influence consumer preference, with some people preferring smaller, portion-controlled sizes, while others opt for larger, more indulgent options.

**Price and Availability:** Cost is always a consideration, as is the ability to purchase the product.

Fudge bar ice cream is widely available in grocery stores, convenience stores, and ice cream shops. Prices vary depending on the brand, size, and location.

**Satisfying Sweet Craving:** For those with a sweet tooth, a fudge bar offers a guilt-free indulgence.

## FAQs Section

**Are fudge bars gluten-free?**
Most commercially available fudge bars are naturally gluten-free, as their main ingredients (milk, sugar, cocoa) do not contain gluten. Though, it's always vital to check the ingredient list and allergen information on the packaging to ensure that the specific brand you're purchasing is certified gluten-free and has not been processed in a facility that handles gluten-containing ingredients.

**What is the difference between a fudge bar and a chocolate ice cream bar?**
While both fudge bars and chocolate ice cream bars are chocolate-flavored frozen desserts, they differ in their composition and texture. Fudge bars typically have a denser, more fudge-like texture and a richer chocolate flavor due to a higher concentration of cocoa solids.

Keep the bars tightly wrapped in their original packaging and store them in the coldest part of your freezer, ideally at a temperature of 0°F (-18°C) or lower. Avoid storing them in the freezer door, as this area is subject to temperature fluctuations.

**Can I make my own fudge bars at home?**
Yes,making homemade fudge bars is a relatively simple process that allows you to customize the ingredients and flavors to your liking. There are numerous recipes available online and in cookbooks that use a combination of milk, cream, sugar, cocoa powder, and other flavorings. you'll need popsicle molds or small cups to freeze the mixture into individual bars.

1mhbmdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autoimmune/comments/1mhbmdw/skin_inflammation_and_food_intolerances_after_3rd/,"Skin inflammation and food intolerances after 3rd COVID booster. Psoriasis diagnosis, gut-immune link?","Hi everyone,

I’m a 30-year-old male, and I’m reaching out because I’ve been dealing with a chronic health issue that began after my third COVID booster shot. I’ve seen multiple doctors and naturopaths and tried many different approaches, but so far, nothing has brought lasting relief. I’m hoping someone here can relate or has suggestions.

Before the vaccine, I could eat absolutely anything without issues. I had no food sensitivities, no skin problems, and no gut symptoms whatsoever. That said, I did consume quite a lot of alcohol and drugs during my teenage years and early twenties, which may have contributed to weakening my system over time.

Shortly after the booster, I began to react strongly to certain foods. The symptoms are entirely skin-related. I have no digestive discomfort at all. Instead, I experience inflammation on specific areas of my body, redness, itching, and occasionally dyshidrotic eczema on my hands. It took me quite a while to realize that food was the trigger. A dermatologist performed a biopsy and diagnosed me with psoriasis, although the appearance and behavior of my skin don’t really match typical plaque psoriasis.

Over time, I’ve identified several consistent food triggers. These include fructans (like those in onions, garlic, and wheat), histamine-rich foods (such as aged cheese and fermented products), fructose, most raw vegetables, and nuts or very fatty foods, which seem to provoke the dyshidrotic eczema in particular. I also react negatively to anything that stresses the gut or stomach, including coffee and spicy food. I generally feel better when I avoid vegetables altogether.

At the moment, my diet mainly consists of meat, fish, eggs, some cheese, rice, spelt, potatoes, and cooked vegetables. I eat almost no sugar and try to keep alcohol intake as low as possible. On this diet, my skin is about 98% clear (I have one resistant patch) but if I cheat even a little (especially with fructans and histamin), the inflammation flares up the very next day.

I’ve tried many diets over the years, including carnivore, vegan, low FODMAP, the autoimmune protocol (AIP), ketogenic, paleo and fasting. Some I followed very strictly, others more loosely. None provided lasting improvement. I’m fairly certain that a strict low-histamine carnivore diet would keep my skin clear, but it’s extremely difficult to sustain and nearly impossible to fit into my daily life. 

I’ve also experimented with a wide range of supplements: multivitamins, omega-3s, zinc L-carnosine, L-glutamine, collagen, DAO enzymes, digestive enzymes, and many different probiotics. I made homemade yogurt following Dr. William Davis’ method, but unfortunately that also triggered dyshidrotic eczema.

I tried to fix leaky gut with some protocols but also no improvement. (Zonulin was normal in my test anyway)

As for testing, I did a SIBO breath test shortly after my symptoms began, and it came back negative. I still don’t believe I have SIBO, since I’ve never experienced IBS-like symptoms or any digestive issues. At least some of my intolerances and symptoms might be explained by SIBO, so I’m curious. Does this sound right to others? Could SIBO still be a possibility without typical gut symptoms?

I also had a comprehensive microbiome analysis, which revealed significant dysbiosis. I tried correcting this with targeted probiotics and prebiotics based on the results, but unfortunately saw no noticeable improvement. I'm not sure what to think about those tests and if its worth the money. Even high-dose probiotic capsules seem to do nothing for me.

I’ve also ruled out classic allergies.

At this point, I suspect the root of the problem lies in a complex interaction between the gut, the immune system, and the skin. The fact that I don’t have any gut symptoms but very strong skin reactions suggests some kind of systemic immune dysfunction, possibly triggered by the vaccine and compounded by earlier alcohol use. 

By now, I know exactly which foods I can tolerate and which I can’t, and I’ve built my daily routine around that. In that sense, I’m managing, but I still long for my old life. It stresses me a lot when I don’t have control over what I eat for example, in hotels, cafeterias, business dinners, or when I’m with a large group of people.

So I’m wondering:  
• Has anyone experienced anything similar?  
• Do you have food-triggered skin issues without digestive symptoms?  
• Did any of this start after a COVID vaccination?  
• Have you found treatments, protocols, or practitioners that actually helped?  
• And most importantly: how can I support or heal my gut/immune system without using fermented foods? 

Any advice, personal experiences, or insight would mean a lot. This has been a long and isolating journey, and just hearing from others who can relate would be a huge encouragement. Thanks so much for reading.",1,1754309252.0,Autoimmune,0,1.0,False

I grew up without seeing adult friendships modeled to me. My parents didn’t have any friends, so I never really learned what healthy adult friendships look like or what’s realistic to expect.

Now, in my late twenties, I find myself feeling increasingly sad and dissatisfied with the friendships in my life. I’m married and deeply value my relationship, but I still crave strong, emotionally supportive friendships. That need hasn’t gone away just because I’m in a relationship.

The main thing I keep noticing is how hard it is to find people who want to meet regularly or build anything consistent. Even arranging a simple coffee often takes months. Most of my friendships feel like we’re just orbiting each other occasionally checking in but never really present. It leaves me feeling like I’m always the one reaching out or trying to maintain momentum.

There is one friend I’ve been seeing fairly regularly about once every couple of weeks for the past year. But recently I’ve had a few personal crises, and I’ve noticed that even this friend seems to fade or pull back when things get hard for me. It’s really highlighted this sinking feeling that if I were in real trouble, I wouldn’t know who to call. I don’t think I could count on anyone for emotional support. 

As someone who has no family connections (estranged) I really feel it's my job to create a support system but it hasn't been happening.

## Key features Analysis

The best copper tea kettles offer a blend of beauty and performance, incorporating elements that enhance both the brewing experience and the kettle's longevity.

**Material and Construction:** The material quality and craftsmanship significantly impact a copper tea kettle's performance and durability.

High-quality copper, typically 99.9% pure, ensures excellent heat conductivity. The thickness of the copper also matters. Thicker copper retains heat longer and is less prone to dents and warping. Seams should be expertly welded or brazed to prevent leaks and ensure the kettle's structural integrity.A durable interior lining, often made of tin or stainless steel, is essential for food safety and to prevent copper from leaching into the water.

**Heating Capacity and Efficiency:** Rapid and even heating is a crucial factor to consider in a copper tea kettle.

A well-designed copper kettle should heat up water quickly and uniformly across the entire surface. The base of the kettle plays a significant role in heat distribution. Some models feature a wider base or a multi-layered encapsulated base for improved heating efficiency. The capacity, usually ranging from 1 to 2.5 quarts, should suit your household's needs. Pay attention to the kettle's ability to maintain water temperature for an extended period.

**Handle and Spout Design:** The handle and spout are vital for safe and agreeable pouring.Ergonomically designed handles made of heat-resistant materials, such as wood or insulated stainless steel, provide a secure and comfortable grip. Some kettles feature handles that are offset to prevent burns from steam. The spout design influences the pour's steadiness and precision.A gooseneck spout provides excellent control, making it ideal for pour-over coffee or tea preparation. Look for a spout that resists drips and spills.

**safety Features:** Safety features protect users and prevent accidents.

Overheating protection is a must-have,automatically shutting off the kettle if it runs dry. A secure lid that stays in place during pouring prevents scalding. Some kettles feature a whistle to signal when the water has boiled, adding an extra layer of safety. A well-insulated handle remains cool to the touch, minimizing the risk of burns.

**Aesthetic Design:** While functionality is key, the visual appeal of a copper tea kettle is often a significant consideration.

Copper tea kettles come in various styles, from classic and customary to modern and minimalist.The finish can range from polished and shiny to hammered and rustic. Details such as the shape of the kettle, the design of the lid, and the overall proportions contribute to its aesthetic appeal. A well-crafted copper kettle should complement the kitchen’s décor and reflect the owner’s personal style.

## core Benefits

A high-quality copper tea kettle offers several practical and aesthetic advantages.**Rapid and Efficient Heating:** Copper's exceptional thermal conductivity ensures that water heats up quickly. This saves time and energy, making it ideal for busy mornings or when you need a speedy cup of tea. Users report a noticeable reduction in boiling time compared to stainless steel or glass kettles, often by as much as 20-30%.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** A copper tea kettle adds a touch of elegance and warmth to any kitchen. Its lustrous finish and timeless design make it a lovely centerpiece. Manny people choose copper kettles not just for their functionality but also for their ability to enhance their kitchen décor.

**Improved Water Purity:** When lined with tin or stainless steel, a copper tea kettle provides a safe and healthy way to boil water. The lining prevents copper from leaching into the water, ensuring that your tea or coffee tastes pure and clean. This also eliminates any metallic taste that can sometimes occur with other types of kettles.

**Precise Pouring and Control:** Kettles with gooseneck spouts offer excellent pouring control, making them perfect for pour-over coffee or tea. This allows you to evenly saturate the grounds or tea leaves, resulting in a more flavorful and aromatic brew.

## FAQs Section

**Are copper tea kettles safe to use?**

Yes, provided they have a food-grade lining, typically tin or stainless steel. The lining prevents copper from leaching into the water, making it safe for consumption.Always ensure that the lining is intact and free from damage.

**How do I clean and maintain a copper tea kettle?**

Regular cleaning is essential to maintain the kettle's appearance and performance. Use a gentle copper cleaner or a mixture of vinegar and salt to remove tarnish. Avoid abrasive cleaners that can scratch the surface. For the interior, boil water with lemon juice or vinegar to remove mineral deposits.

**Can I use a copper tea kettle on all types of stovetops?**

Most copper tea kettles are compatible with gas, electric, and ceramic stovetops. Though, induction stovetops may require a kettle with a magnetic base. Always check the manufacturer's specifications before use.

**How often should I delime my copper tea kettle?**

The frequency of deliming depends on the hardness of your water.If you notice mineral deposits forming inside the kettle, it's time to delime. Typically, deliming every 1-3 months is sufficient for most households.

I already appreciate the reasons for expensive coffee- variety, scarcity, the process, etc and understand the honest value in something like a natural process Ethiopian but honestly, I just think this is getting out of hand. Can we attribute the disproportionate cost purely to hype / or is there something I’m missing? 

—

I saw recent post asking about where to buy something called “Letty”, I was a little bit curious since they explained it was so expensive in New York City. Not being familiar with what it was, I made the recommendation to Greenwood Lake roasters for what I consider to be high-quality coffee that you can get shipped at a fair price.

I’ve been making pourover for a while now and appreciate the value of freshly roasted beans from a single origin-usually enjoying Ethiopian natural process. I thought I had reached the end of the line when it came to having high-quality coffee, but after researching this so-called “Letty“, I was shocked to see how expensive it was.

I recognize the cost and value of high quality coffee- for example when I go to Monmouth Coffee, I will spend 43£/Kg for a natural process Ethiopian coffee called Tibebu Roba. Just to elaborate, Tibebu Roba is the name of the farmer who grows and harvest this coffee. All to say I’m not sure how much more bespoke a coffee can get than that. 

It took me a long time to wrap my head around spending that much money on coffee when I know I can get a fairly good “single origin” Kenyan coffee from Aldi for £2.99/227g. In fact, if I could probably drink nothing but that coffee from Aldi if I had to, and I think I would be pretty content (albeit maybe uninspired), but because I don’t drink alcohol, I “splurge” on what I think of as already, incredibly expensive coffee. 

Just a cursory glance at what this Gesha called “Letty” costs after the automatic conversion from USD to GBP I am shocked once more - £23-114g/ £36-227g/ £115-907g.

What the actual F?? 

Even at the best value rate of buying 2lb- for £115(~$150) - that is obscene- like nearly three times more expensive than the coffee I already buy- and that is one of the most expensive coffees that Monmouth Coffee- a roaster who has prime real estate based a ten minute walk from the Shard (a national landmark in the UK) - charges.  

I’m struggling to find a decent  justification, beyond the beans being rare, tasting nice, labor. I guess I made this post because I am offended by pricing like this; It just feel dishonest and like hype.

I don’t think I will ever be convinced to spend that much money on Coffee when I know that there are countless exciting coffees that literally still cost a fraction of this. When I asked AI about this, it explained Gesha coffees usually cost more because of the above, but also cup quality/scoring, philosophy, and marketing packaging branding. Is it just me or does that all just sound like hype? What am I missing? ",0,1754308426.0,pourover,18,0.4,False

Community strength can come in many forms, from IRL efforts to social media efforts to whatever else, it doesn't really matter. A strong community gives a coin constant engagement and free advertisement. I am not a psychologist so idk why advertisement works, but Coca Cola still use it so it must be very important.

Coca Cola is such a well known brand i'd honestly guess 90% of people globally have heard of it, yet they still use adverts...

Kendu is an example of an extremely strong community, we have a lot of IRL initiatives such as a street team that attends festivals, energy drinks, coffee, merch, a pickleball tournament in India, beer and much more! We also do not slack on the social media front, with an insane Reddit community, I am sure you have seen Kendu before. Our engagement is unmatched, just check any memecoin subreddit!

We also have a very strong community on Twitter and Stocktwits, Kendu is truly everywhere. We are the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes for the free audit, Pepe is the only other coin to achieve this feat! Certik rates our community at 92.44 out of 100 whilst coins in the hundreds of millions have ratings below 80... It is so obvious that Kendu is a massive contender and our potential is limitless.

I would highly recommend you join our telegram and check out the vibes, we also have a very active subreddit but our telegram is busier. Get involved, ask any questions and see what you think!

* Measured **total work time** (average: 6h 12m/day)
* Logged **sleep quality score** (1-100)

* Admin work in the afternoons? Forget it, even coffee doesn’t help
* Sleep quality below 70 dropped my productivity by \~30%
* On days when I matched tasks to my energy peaks, I got **42% more done** in less time

## Key Features Analysis

Triangular bowls are characterized by several key features that define their functionality and aesthetic appeal.

**Material Composition:** The materials used to construct triangular bowls significantly impact their durability,heat resistance,and overall aesthetic. Bowls can be made from various materials, including ceramic, glass, plastic, stainless steel, and even wood. Ceramic bowls offer a classic and elegant look, are often microwave and dishwasher safe, and provide good heat retention. Glass bowls are visually appealing, easy to clean, and showcase the bowl's contents.Plastic bowls are lightweight, durable, and frequently enough more affordable, making them suitable for casual use. Stainless steel bowls are incredibly durable, resistant to corrosion, and often used in professional kitchens.Wooden bowls bring a natural and rustic charm,although they require more careful maintenance.

The choice of material should align with the intended use and aesthetic preferences. For example, ceramic or glass might be preferred for formal dining, while plastic or stainless steel is ideal for everyday use or outdoor settings.

**Size and Dimensions:** Triangular bowls come in various sizes, which impacts their suitability for different purposes. Small triangular bowls may serve as condiment dishes,while larger ones could function as salad bowls or decorative centerpieces. The dimensions,including the length of each side and the depth of the bowl,determine its capacity and how well it fits within a tablescape or on a shelf.

Consider the intended use of the bowl when evaluating size. A small, shallow bowl might be perfect for holding dips or nuts, whereas a larger, deeper bowl woudl be more appropriate for salads or pasta dishes.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The aesthetic design is a crucial factor for triangular bowls, as they are often chosen for their visual appeal. Design elements include the shape of the triangle (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene), the curvature of the sides, the finish (matte, glossy, textured), and any decorative patterns or colors. A well-designed triangular bowl should complement the surrounding decor and enhance the presentation of its contents.Some bowls feature minimalist designs with clean lines and a simple finish, while others incorporate intricate patterns or vibrant colors for a more artistic statement. The overall design should reflect your personal style and enhance the dining or display experience.

**Stability and Balance:** Given their unique shape, the stability and balance of triangular bowls are crucial considerations.A well-designed bowl should sit securely on a flat surface without wobbling or tipping over easily. The base of the bowl often features a wider design or non-slip material to enhance stability.

The distribution of weight is critical to ensure that the bowl remains stable when filled.Bowls with a lower center of gravity tend to be more stable and less prone to spills.

**Versatility and Functionality:** Triangular bowls can serve multiple functions, depending on their design and material. They are suitable for serving food,displaying decorative items,organizing small objects,or even as stand-alone art pieces. Their unique shape adds a visual interest that conventional bowls lack.

Some bowls feature handles or spouts for easier pouring, while others are stackable for convenient storage. the versatility of a triangular bowl makes it a valuable addition to any home.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:** The ease of cleaning and maintaining the bowl is also an important consideration. Materials like ceramic, glass, and stainless steel are generally dishwasher safe and easy to wipe clean. Plastic bowls may stain more easily, depending on the type of plastic used. Wooden bowls require more careful handling and are usually hand-washed and oiled periodically to prevent drying and cracking.

Check the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning and maintenance before purchasing a triangular bowl to ensure it fits your lifestyle and cleaning preferences.

## Core Benefits

Triangular bowls offer several benefits compared to traditional bowls, impacting both functionality and aesthetics.**Enhanced Presentation:** The unique shape of triangular bowls elevates the presentation of food and decorative items. Their unconventional design adds a touch of modern elegance to any table setting. As an example, serving sushi or appetizers in a triangular bowl instantly enhances the visual appeal, making the dish more inviting.**Space Optimization:** Triangular bowls can often fit into corners or tight spaces more efficiently than round bowls. This is particularly useful in small kitchens or buffet setups where space is limited. A triangular bowl filled with candies could sit neatly in the corner of a coffee table, maximizing available space.

**Improved Portion Control:** The shape of a triangular bowl can subtly influence portion sizes. The distinct angles and lines encourage diners to take smaller portions, which supports healthy eating habits. By using triangular bowls for snacks, individuals may reduce overall calorie consumption.

**Unique Decorative Element:** Triangular bowls themselves can serve as decorative elements, even when empty. Their geometric shape adds a modern and artistic touch to living spaces. A decorative triangular bowl made of glass can be an eye-catching centerpiece on a dining table.

Guests are often intrigued by their unique shape and functionality, leading to engaging discussions. Presenting cheeses and crackers in a set of triangular bowls is one way to elicit questions from the dinner guests.

## FAQs Section

**Are triangular bowls dishwasher safe?**
The dishwasher safety of triangular bowls largely depends on the material. Ceramic, glass, and stainless-steel triangular bowls are often dishwasher safe.However, it's always best to check the manufacturer's instructions to confirm. Plastic bowls might potentially be dishwasher safe on the top rack, but high heat can sometimes warp them. Wooden bowls should never be placed in the dishwasher as the moisture and heat can damage the wood.

**What are the best uses for triangular bowls?**
Triangular bowls are versatile and can be used for a variety of purposes. They're ideal for serving appetizers, snacks, salads, desserts, and sauces. They can also be used as decorative display pieces for holding potpourri, jewelry, or other small items. Their unique shape makes them particularly well-suited for displaying items that benefit from an angular presentation, such as sushi or artisanal cheeses.

**How do I prevent triangular bowls from tipping over?**
To prevent tipping, opt for triangular bowls with a wider base or purchase those featuring a non-slip bottom. Bowls with a heavier material, such as stoneware, are also less prone to tipping than lighter plastic ones. When placing items in the bowl, distribute the weight evenly and avoid overloading one side which can cause imbalance.

**Are triangular bowls more expensive than regular bowls?**
The price of triangular bowls varies depending on the material, design, and brand. Some high-end ceramic or designer glass triangles can be pricier than standard round or square bowls. However, there are also affordable plastic and stoneware options available. it's possible to find triangular bowls that fit within a range of budgets and suit various needs.

I got up early with my husband to see him off to work, get his coffee ready, help him pack, etc. We both normally work from home but he has to go in for stretches of a couple of days each month. I didn’t have to be up for hours after he would leave so I could’ve just stayed in bed, but no. I got up at the ass crack of dawn to help him out. He’s admittedly not a morning person and has told me before (in a not so graceful or loving way of course) that me talking too much in the morning annoys him. So I was extra cautious to not be too much this morning since he was already unhappy being awake so early and needing to go into work. 

Here’s where my grand folly took place. I asked him if he wanted a “sweet and salty bar” to take for breakfast. It’s like a granola bar. I clearly should’ve just called it a granola bar because he immediately followed my question by mockingly saying “sweet and salty” while whistling the S’s. He told me I never used to do that and it annoys the crap out of him. 

I’m pregnant and about to enter the third trimester so I am definitely a bit more sensitive than normal but tbh I’ve always been a little sensitive regardless. Am I being ridiculous by being so salty (pun intended) about this? I tried to be a helpful and loving wife who didn’t talk too much this morning and this is how he treats me? 

I continued to make his coffee and snapped a little asking if he wanted SSSSimple SSSYRUP in it. Over-exaggerating and trying my hardest to not at all whistle my S’s through eyes welling with tears. He never apologized, only noticed I was fighting tears back and acted like he had said nothing and continued out the door to work. 

This happened a couple of days to a week after he told me my talking too much in the morning annoyed him. Either he’s becoming even less of a morning person as time goes on or he just hates me suddenly? There’s things about him that annoy me but I don’t snap at him over them. I understand everyone is going to get under your skin a little, especially if you’re with them all the time like a spouse but damn. Is it too much to ask for a little love and respect as I am? Or if I’m being so annoying maybe just talking to me nicely about it? He gets all grumpy and short with me and then just snaps out of nowhere. Am I being dramatic feeling so gutted over this? I can watch how much I talk in the morning but avoiding or changing how I say the S sound in words isn’t so easy. I feel so annoying, self-conscious, and unlovable.

1mhb2ls,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1mhb2ls/too_damn_crowded/,Too damn crowded,"I wanted to give an official review of my first cruise with Royal, but don’t honestly know where to start…Allure of the Seas, Mediterranean. Let me start by saying we know we were extremely lucky to be able to afford this trip. And we know this is the high season for the area. But there was so much left to be desired. This is our fifth cruise total; first cruise after Covid. Why we picked a ship in the busiest itinerary with more than 6000 people on board I don’t know…it was mostly bc what I read about teenagers. We sailed Disney when the kids were little and Norwegian for tween time, but thought we would choose one of the most exciting ships for their teen cruise. Also, my son is at that stage where he cannot eat enough food. So at worst we figured we had a moving hotel room with buffet. But I was hoping to really love the ship, too. 

The gimmicks didn’t land (like zip line, rock climbing..) the teen club didn’t engage (how about a team leader or something?) and my husband and I were extremely disappointed with the food and not being able to find one spot away from the crowds. I personally love the shows, and royal was a major step down from Disney. One of the singers was lip syncing, was she an understudy? The cruise director was telling us only things we already knew, never something special. Disney just coddles you- if there’s a question, usually someone has already answered it for you. Even on a large ship of 4000 people on Disney you never felt crowded. Here we knew we were going to be doing “what everyone else wants to do at the same time everyone else wants to do it”, so we buckled down for that, but it was ten times worse than what we thought it would be. Any time we needed to figure something out, it was so bizarre, we sometimes got three different answers.  The app was glitchy, and I hated that we still carried our phones everywhere. I like us to be unplugged.  But it was helpful to be able to text each other… when it worked. 

Shore excursions…I was extremely nervous to get to Rome and knew we had to try to get to the train station as quickly as possible. I didn’t know arriving at 7 am meant not letting the gangway down until 7:30 am. So you do not have 12 hours at port, take away one hour right away. And Rome is a madhouse in the summer so you have to book timed tickets for popular excursions so I thought starting to look at 10 am wouldn’t be a problem. I also knew from my research there was a city shuttle bus from port terminal to train station for 6 euros per person, or a 25 min walk, which we never mind doing. When we got off the ship they had a sign for RC shore excursions and then a sign for the “free” shuttle to the port terminal. So I ask about the paid shuttle and they said that’s for a fee, so I assumed it was for RC shore excursions, which was charging $120 pp for the train we took for 8 euros pp. We get on the free shuttle to the port terminal and I assume we will walk but I then notice the other bus was that city bus that goes directly to the train for 6 euros, NOT a RC shore excursion bus….it was so frustrating. I understand RC wants to make money on shore excursions but in these busy ports with this busy time a year, just give us a damn free shuttle bus to the train station (or even charge a small fee.) we had a similar experience in La Spezia, as we were trying to meet up a guide 20 mins away at 9 am. We were sweating. 7:30 arrival, not 7. And 25 min walk to train station. And then book the right train ticket for your first time in Italy in under 5 mins. We got there…but others did not and I don’t blame them. 

Community- The sail away party, for instance…they have left no room for celebration or bon voyage…just a DJ and about three lines deep for dancing. It was my experience on Disney that absolutely everyone engages in this moment- it’s such a fun party and starts the cruise off with a feeling of togetherness. This left me thinking rather than there being tons of things to do, there is just a lot of “throw things up and see what sticks.” I guess there was a balloon drop? At midnight? Dude we just arrived and are jet lagged! 

The pool decks- always mobbed- even in the solarium, all the chairs have a towel on them at all times. It’s rude. I can’t imagine what a “perfect day” islands are like in the Carib- can they accommodate 6000 chairs there? The slides are ok..why is the dry slide ever closed?? Seems like a fun way to go down three floors, but we had to time it just right so we only did it once. 

Most people seem to prefer windjammer buffet to MDR, so why can’t we sit by the window if it’s free? Or upstairs? Things you probably have to fight for/ know in advance, we are not ones to compete like that. We don’t even like to order room service, so a plate of cookies out late night would be nice? Or for late night eats, why is the hot dog stand or the taco place EVER closed?? Seems to be easy to manage. We did eat at two specialty restaurants but the quality was not much better. We were looking for say, capital grille and we got Outback Steakhouse. We love Outback, it’s just not a “special, birthday level celebration” kind of place for us. And after budgeting for the cruise for months, I didn’t want to pay more for specialty meals. 

The rooms were spacious, the crew members were lovely…the management at the top is misguided. You can’t put this many people on a boat at once. Maybe I’m getting too old for this…because my morning coffee in Central Park was my only moment of peace for our two at sea days. Whichever redditor told us to book on Central Park level is my new best friend. It was quiet, we were forward so every time we walked aft we would walk through the park. That was very nice. 

I love people, I love a party…honestly, I do…this was like Black Friday at the mall in the 90s. ",0,1754307601.0,royalcaribbean,14,0.29,False

1mhazqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mhazqv/eureka_mignon_silenzio_50_vs_zero_65_all_purpose/,Eureka Mignon Silenzio 50 vs Zero 65 All Purpose [400 €],"Hi guys,

I am deciding between two Eureka Mignon grinders, the Silenzio 50 and the Zero 65 All Purpose.

I'm currently on a Graef CM 702 and need to switch, mainly because we just moved and I need a grinder that is quieter. Since I earn more money now, I also decided to upgrade to better quality.

Usage is for 1/6 Espresso (currently out of a De'Longhi Dedica Style EC 685.M, I plan to upgrade to a ""real"" espresso machine some time), 1/3 Bialetti New Venus, 1/3 Moccamaster and 1/6 Cold Brew. As you might already have guessed, I am single dosing - even more so, since I am switching between normal and decaf during the day.

I know that two (or even more) grinders would be better and that there are other grinders out there that might be better suited for my needs. I also know those two aren't exactly made for the same use cases, but they are the ones that are available to me and would match the other stuff in my kitchen. I also don't have the room to keep the Graef (or to get any other second) grinder.

What I am saying is: The choice is set between those two for use as an all purpose grinder.

If I get the Silenzio 50 I know that means I will have to change the dial on the Silenzio, i.e. to the Aro Espresso One. In that case I am also contemplating making a tilted base and getting a single dose hopper with bellows. Since I can get the Silenzio quite cheap, even the grinder and all those upgrades would still be less money than for the Zero 65 All Purpose.

On the other hand I would also be gladly willing to pay the (relatively small) premium to get the Zero 65 All Purpose.

The main reason I am considering the Silenzio 50 over the Zero 65 All Purpose is noise.

The Silenzio is being praised as very quiet in reviews. In a manual, I found a specification of 73 dBA. A Professional review at kaffeemacher.ch measured 78,9 dB for the Specialità, which as far as I know should be about the same as the Silenzio 50.

In a brochure from Eureka for the Zero 65 All Purpose, it says 57,5 dB (vacuum measurement) and 91,5 dB (measurement with coffee). The guys who tested the Specialità also tested the Mignon Libra 65 All purpose at 84,2 dB, but I don't know whether that one and the Zero 65 All Purpose have the same level of noise.

If that would be the case, it sounds like the Zero 65 All Purpose might be quite loud and not really an upgrade to the Graef CM 702 in that regards. I couldn't find data for it and don't have tools to measure it, but the ""bigger brother"" Graef CM 800 got tested at 85,7 dB by the guys who did the previously mentioned tests of the the Specialità and the Libra 65 All Purpose.

Can anyone confirm these figures or compare the Silenzio 50 to the Zero 65 All Purpose? Is it right that the Zero 65 All Purpose is almost 20 dB louder than the Silenzio during grinding?

Also: According to the description on Eureka's website while it was still listed, the Mignon Silenzio 50 is suitable for “All Purpose” use, i.e., for espresso, moka, filter, and even French Press/Cold Brew. Is this correct? Are there any practical limitations compared to the Zero 65 All Purpose model in this regard?

I am sorry this text got so long, but maybe someone can help me making a decision... Thanks in advance and best regards, Vincent",1,1754307349.0,espresso,1,0.99,False

# AUGUST 4th, 2025~China Is Choking Supply of Critical Minerals to Western Defense Companies

[China Is Choking Supply of Critical Minerals to Western Defense Companies](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/china-is-choking-supply-of-critical-minerals-to-western-defense-companies/ar-AA1JQ1qs?ocid=msedgntp&pc=HCTS&cvid=6890883908ce462db3ff4ea1fa61063e&ei=9)

[Lockheed Martin, maker of the F-35, has applauded Pentagon investment in non-Chinese magnet supplies.© Dean Lewins\/Shutterstock](https://preview.redd.it/2byds2yufzgf1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=740d474c7b18b6daba047a80dfc10be4d6d89f0c)

China is limiting the flow of critical minerals to Western defense manufacturers, delaying production and forcing companies to scour the world for stockpiles of the minerals needed to make everything from bullets to jet fighters.

Earlier this year, as U.S.-China trade tensions soared, Beijing tightened the controls it places on the export of rare earths. While Beijing allowed them to start flowing after the Trump administration agreed in June to a series of trade concessions, China has maintained a lock on critical minerals for defense purposes. China supplies around 90% of the world’s rare earths and dominates the production of many other critical minerals.

As a result, one drone-parts manufacturer that supplies the U.S. military was forced to delay orders by up to two months while it searched for a non-Chinese source of magnets, which are assembled from rare earths.

Certain materials needed by the defense industry now go for five or more times what was typical before China’s recent mineral restrictions, according to industry traders. One company said it was recently offered samarium—an element needed to make magnets that can withstand the extreme temperatures of a jet-fighter engine—for 60 times the standard price. That is already driving the cost of defense systems higher, say suppliers and defense executives.

The squeeze on critical minerals highlights how dependent the U.S. military is on China for much of its supply chain—giving Beijing leverage at a time of rising tensions between the two powers and heated trade negotiations. Defense manufacturers supplying the U.S. military rely on minerals that are mainly produced in China for microelectronics, drone motors, night-vision goggles, missile-targeting systems and defense satellites.

[\(Pending finance\) \~ NioCorp will produce Nb, Ti & TiCl-4, Sc, Tb, Dy, Ny\/Pr & more....](https://reddit.com/link/1mhax7o/video/2if6xsk0gzgf1/player)

While companies have tried to find alternative sources of these minerals in recent years, some of the elements are so niche that they can’t be economically produced in the West, say industry executives.

China’s Foreign Ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment.

In addition to the more recent export controls on rare earths, China has since December banned sales to the U.S. of germanium, gallium and antimony—which are used for things like hardening lead bullets and projectiles, and to allow soldiers to see at night

Some companies now warn of looming production cuts if more minerals aren’t forthcoming.

On Wednesday, the chief executive of Leonardo DRS said the U.S.-based defense firm is down to its “safety stock” of germanium.

“In order to sustain timely product deliveries, material flow must improve in the second half” of 2025, CEO Bill Lynn said on a conference call. The company is the U.S. subsidiary of Italian defense giant Leonardo.

Germanium goes into the company’s infrared sensors, which are used in missiles and other equipment. Lynn said that the company is looking at diversifying its supply chain while also finding ways to replace it in its products.

The Pentagon is requiring defense contractors to stop buying rare-earth magnets that contain China-sourced minerals by 2027. As a result, some companies have sizable stockpiles of magnets. But suppliers and defense companies often hold less than a year’s worth—some just a few months—of many other critical mineral stockpiles.

Drone manufacturers are among the most vulnerable, because many are small startups and have very limited revenue or supply-chain savvy, and never got around to acquiring large stockpiles of rare-earth magnets and metals, say some in the defense industry.

“I can tell you…we talk about this daily and our companies talk about it daily,” said Dak Hardwick, vice president of international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association, a U.S. defense and commercial aerospace trade group.

More than 80,000 parts that are used in Defense Department weapons systems are made with critical minerals now subject to Chinese export controls, according to data from defense software firm Govini. Nearly all of the supply chains for key critical minerals used by the Pentagon rely on at least one Chinese supplier, Govini said, meaning restrictions from Beijing can cause widespread disruptions.

Since stepping up export controls earlier this year, China has begun requiring companies to provide extensive documentation of how they will use the rare earths and magnets they import. Chinese regulators often demand sensitive information, such as product images and even photos of production lines, to ensure none of the materials go to military use, say Western buyers.

One Western company that supplies Chinese-made rare-earth magnets to both civilian and defense companies says its requests for imported magnets have recently been approved for many civilian purposes—but rejected or delayed for defense and aerospace.

In May, New Hampshire-based ePropelled, which makes propulsion motors for drones, received unsettling questions from its Chinese magnet supplier. The supplier sent Chinese government forms demanding drawings and pictures of ePropelled’s products and a list of buyers. It also asked for assurances that the rare-earth magnets China would supply ePropelled wouldn’t go toward military applications.

“Of course we are not going to provide the Chinese government with that information,” said Chris Thompson, vice president of global sales for ePropelled. The company has about 100 customers, including large American defense contractors and drone manufacturers in Ukraine.

So its Chinese suppliers paused shipping, and ePropelled had to delay some customer orders by one or two months—double the amount of time it usually takes to deliver its motors. The company sought alternative suppliers in the U.S., Europe and Asia, including buying magnets from vendors in Japan and Taiwan, although they too rely on rare earths from China.

The company also struck deals with startup magnet producers Vulcan Elements in North Carolina and Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earth. However, those startups won’t have supply ready for ePropelled until at least the end of this year and will need to build up alternative sources of Chinese-dominated minerals as they scale up production.

Metal traders say that because China demands to know the end user of rare-earth magnets and metals, it isn’t approving licenses for traders to stockpile.

The Department of Defense has awarded grants to expand production of niche materials, including $14 million in funding last year to a Canadian company to produce germanium substrates used in solar cells for defense satellites. In July, the Pentagon took an even bigger step when it agreed to pay $400 million for a stake in MP Materials, the operator of the largest rare-earths mine in the Americas, which is rapidly scaling up its magnet manufacturing capacity.

**The Pentagon didn’t respond to a request for comment.**

On an earnings call last month Lockheed Martin CEO James Taiclet called the MP Materials agreement groundbreaking and said it would help ensure the supply of magnets needed in its [F-35 jet fighters](https://www.wsj.com/business/f35-jet-fighter-tariffs-2b807ad3) and cruise missiles. But building up new supply will take time.

The Defense Department early last year established the Critical Minerals Forum, an effort in part to spur more mineral supply-chain projects in the U.S. and allied countries, including helping metals miners secure funding to increase their output of critical materials like antimony and germanium.

Defense companies that traditionally outsourced the purchase of critical minerals to sub-suppliers are now using their market heft to try to acquire sources of key materials themselves. Major defense companies “are starting to get more and more panicked as they go, because they recognize that they’re just not going to get the magnets, no matter what happens, unless they get involved,” said Nicholas Myers, the CEO of Phoenix Tailings, a Massachusetts startup that produces rare-earth metals.

Beijing is signaling that it takes its mineral export bans very seriously. Earlier this year, one U.S. defense supplier, the United States Antimony Corporation, tried to ship 55 metric tons of antimony mined in Australia to its smelter in Mexico. The load transited via the Chinese port city of Ningbo—until recently a routine practice.

But in April, while the shipment was being transloaded in Ningbo, China customs detained it for three months, prompting United States Antimony to ask the State Department and White House for help.

**The Chinese released the shipment in July, on the condition that it be sent back to Australia and not to the U.S. When it arrived in Australia, United States Antimony learned that product seals had been broken. It is currently working out whether the antimony has been tampered with or contaminated.**

“The shipping company, everyone who was involved, they’d never seen this happen before,” said company CEO Gary Evans.

Neither the White House, the Defense Department nor the State Department provided comment.

# AUGUST 4th, 2025~China Squeezes Critical Mineral Supply to U.S. Defense Industry

[China Squeezes Critical Mineral Supply to U.S. Defense Industry | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-Squeezes-Critical-Mineral-Supply-to-US-Defense-Industry.html)

https://preview.redd.it/1rvg2clfazgf1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=9de194e94a5c2ca796130e8fb79bd5ec299710a8

**China is restricting the supply of critical minerals to U.S. military manufacturers, the Wall Street Journal has** [**reported**](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-western-defense-industry-critical-minerals-3971ec51)**, adding that this has forced companies to delay order deliveries as they sought alternative suppliers.**

The supply restrictions have meanwhile inflated the prices of the critical minerals, the report also said. According to defense industry traders, some of these now cost five times as much as they used to, and in at least one case, a critical mineral cost 60 times as much as it used to before Beijing started to restrict supply.

China completely dominates the global market for critical minerals, putting Western defense manufacturers and their governments in a rather awkward position of depending on China for key raw material supplies amid tense bilateral relations.

China dominates refining for 19 of the 20 critical minerals that the International Energy Agency recently analyzed, holding an average market share of around 70%. “Three-quarters of these minerals have shown greater price volatility than oil, and half have been more volatile than natural gas,” the IEA said in May, noting that major risk areas include high supply chain concentration, price volatility, and by-product dependency.

What is happening right now with U.S. military manufacturers is real-time evidence of this price volatility. Some of these companies are starting to warn about the possibility of production restrictions unless supply improves. One of them, Leonardo DRS, recently warned it has tapped its “safety stock” of germanium. Unless supply of the critical mineral improved by the end of the year, the company would have to delay deliveries.

This suggests the U.S. might be forced to make some concessions to China—because some of these vital minerals for the defense industry cannot be produced economically in the West, the Wall Street Journal wrote. Even those that could be produced economically would take a while to build supply chains.

# AUGUST 4th, 2025~The stealth war: How China is quietly squeezing the lifeline of US military technology through 'magnets'

[The stealth war: How China is quietly squeezing the lifeline of US military technology through 'magnets' - The Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/the-stealth-war-how-china-is-quietly-squeezing-the-lifeline-of-us-military-technology-through-magnets/articleshow/123084346.cms?from=mdr)

[Representative AI Image](https://preview.redd.it/czcxxvax7zgf1.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e437e96132eec443e095d4f3fb0901cf71c4b2b)

China is tightening its grip on the minerals that power the Western world’s most advanced weapons, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. The controls aren’t loud or flashy, aren’t loud or flashy, but they’re being felt in boardrooms, warehouses, and weapons factories across the United States.

The Pentagon has already started to feel the strain. Missiles, fighter jets, radar systems, drones — all depend on a steady stream of materials like gallium, germanium, and rare earth magnets. And right now, that stream is being choked.

In one example, a US drone component maker had its shipments of key Chinese-made magnets held up for weeks. Chinese suppliers had suddenly begun demanding detailed information about where the parts were going and how they’d be used. Chris Thompson, Vice President of Global Sales at ePropelled, said the company refused.

“Of course we are not going to provide the Chinese government with that information,” Chris Thompson told WSJ.

As a result, the magnets stopped arriving. Production delays followed. ET has not been able to independently verify these claims.

# What these critical minerals are and why they matter

These minerals aren’t obscure. They're the building blocks of nearly every modern military system.  
Gallium is used in radar and satellite communications. Germanium is key for night vision and infrared imaging. Antimony is used in explosives and armour-piercing ammunition. Rare earth elements like neodymium and samarium are found in high-performance magnets, which power everything from missile guidance systems to drone propulsion and F-35 flight controls.

**Some, like dysprosium and terbium, are essential for heat-resistant alloys in jet engines. Others, like gadolinium, are critical for sonar and underwater surveillance systems.**

These materials aren’t just important, they’re irreplaceable. Substitutes either don’t exist or don’t work nearly as well.

And the problem isn’t just that China mines a lot of them. It’s that China processes and refines most of the global supply. Even when the raw materials come from somewhere else, they often pass through Chinese refineries before reaching the production floor.

# America’s arsenal is built on fragile foundations

This isn’t just a one-off problem. The deeper you look, the more it becomes clear: America’s defense supply chain is built on materials it doesn’t control.

Govini, a defence analytics firm, recently found that more than 80,000 parts used across Pentagon weapons systems rely on minerals now facing Chinese restrictions. In many cases, these supply chains include only one or two vendors, and nearly all of them are connected to China.

“We talk about this daily and our companies talk about it daily,” said Dak Hardwick, Aerospace Industries Association, as reported by WSJ.

Leonardo DRS, a US military tech supplier, warned it’s already down to its ""safety stock"" of germanium, a metal essential for missile infrared sensors.

“In order to sustain timely product deliveries, material flow must improve in the second half,” said Lenardo DRS's CEO Bill Lynn during a conference call with WSJ.

That’s the reality. Without these minerals, weapons can’t be built. Full stop.

# From rare earths to antimony: China’s weapon of choice

The control isn’t just about rare earths. It includes antimony, used in explosives. Gallium and germanium, critical for semiconductors and optics. Samarium, gadolinium, dysprosium, all found in advanced radar and targeting systems.

When China blocked exports of germanium and gallium in late 2024, the market barely blinked at first. But by April 2025, it expanded the bans to cover seven more categories of rare earths. Prices spiked. Delivery times stretched out. In one case, a western buyer was quoted a rate 60 times above the usual market price.

In another, US Antimony Corporation had a shipment of 55 tonnes of Australian-mined antimony blocked at Ningbo port. It sat for three months before being sent back, with seals broken and no clear explanation.

# The West is years behind, and China plans to exploit it

There’s only one operational rare earths mine in the United States: Mountain Pass in California. While it’s been scaling up output, refining remains a problem. Much of the ore it produces still ends up in China for processing.

MP Materials, which runs the mine, received over $400 million in US government funding to close that loop. But the gap between extraction and end-use is still wide.

Ukraine has emerged as a possible new source of rare earths and titanium, with the US pushing to support its mining sector as part of postwar reconstruction. But experts are blunt about the timeline.

“Developing mine sites and sufficient infrastructure in the war-torn nation will take time, potentially decades,” said Aidan Knight, an associate analyst from GlobalData, as per a report by US Critical Minerals website.

In the meantime, the Pentagon has invoked emergency powers under the Defence Production Act to fast-track domestic mining. DARPA is trying to predict global supply trends using modelling software. And companies like Charles River Analytics are being paid millions to map out alternative sourcing strategies.

Still, none of this is fast. And none of it changes the fact that in 2024, China produced 750 out of 760 tonnes of primary gallium worldwide. The US produced zero.

# Running out the clock

Time is now the biggest factor. The Pentagon has ordered contractors to phase out all Chinese rare earth magnets by 2027. Most firms have a few months of stockpiles, at best. For smaller defence suppliers, that’s not a transition, it’s a cliff edge.

This isn't the first time China has flexed its minerals. Back in 2010, it cut off rare earth exports to Japan over a maritime dispute. The move worked. Japan backed down. The message stuck.

This time, the target is wider. And the stakes are higher.

# No minerals, no missiles

The logic is simple. You can't build 21st-century weapons without 21st-century materials. If a missile guidance system needs gallium and there’s no gallium, that missile doesn’t get made. If a fighter jet needs neodymium magnets and none are arriving, the assembly line stops.

As per a report by US Critical Minerals website, Lewis Black, CEO of Almonty Industries, which mines tungsten, put it plainly, “We are trying to break that addiction \[to Chinese supply\] because… like all addictions, it is unhealthy. We cannot afford to go cold turkey because we are just not strong enough to do it.""

Until the addiction is broken, through new mines, new partnerships, and new infrastructure, Washington’s military ambitions will remain dependent on decisions made in Beijing.

Not just a trade problem. A strategic vulnerability.

# AUGUST 3rd, 2025~SSN(X): The New Navy Attack Submarine That Could ‘Break’ Russia or China in a War

[SSN\(X\): \~2040\~The New Navy Attack Submarine That Could ‘Break’ Russia or China in a War© SSN 774 Virginia Class Submarine Artist Rendering from U.S. Navy.](https://preview.redd.it/5z2g0kybkzgf1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=516b547110356b272aab02f0353b762266cdd1f6)

**Key Points and Summary -** The U.S. Navy is transitioning from its current Virginia-class Block V attack submarine to the next-generation SSN(X).

\-While the Block V is an evolutionary, versatile multi-mission platform serving as a ""bridge to the future,"" the SSN(X) is a revolutionary new design focused on ensuring dominance in a future peer conflict.

\-The SSN(X) is expected to be larger, faster, and the ""quietest submarine ever built.""

\-It will carry a more advanced payload, including hypersonic missiles, and act as an underwater ""mothership"" for unmanned systems, consolidating the roles of multiple submarine classes into one superior platform.

# SSN(X) Submarine Could Change Naval History

The U.S. Navy is currently undergoing a significant transformation in its undersea warfare capabilities, transitioning from the highly capable Virginia-class Block V submarines to the next-generation SSN(X) program. While both are [nuclear-powered attack submarines](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/a-u-s-navy-seawolf-class-submarine-will-be-out-of-action-for-5-years/), they differ significantly in their design philosophies and characteristics. The Virginia Block V is the culmination of decades of experience, while the SSN(X) is intended to redefine and revolutionize submarine warfare.

# Virginia-Class vs SSN(X)-Class: What’s the Difference?

The Virginia-class was developed in the post-Cold War era as a more cost-effective and versatile alternative to the Seawolf-class. [The Block V variant](https://submarinesuppliers.org/programs/ssn-ssgn/virginia-class/), the latest and most advanced, reflects a steady evolution of the class. It incorporates lessons learned from earlier blocks and adapts to emerging threats, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. Its design emphasizes multi-mission flexibility, modularity, and affordability.

Strategically, the Block V serves to replace the aging Los Angeles-class submarines and supplement the [Ohio-class](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/america-deploys-u-s-nuclear-submarines-after-very-dangerous-russian-threats/) guided missile submarines (SSGNs) with enhanced capabilities for cruise missiles. A key feature of the Block V is the Virginia Payload Module (VPM), which significantly increases its missile capacity and overall firepower.

**In contrast, the SSN(X) is an entirely new platform designed to ensure the next generation of American undersea dominance. It aims to combine the best attributes of the Seawolf-class (noted for its speed and stealth), the Virginia-class (known for its versatility), and the** [**Columbia-class**](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/the-navys-348000000000-columbia-class-submarine-nightmare/) **(recognized for its endurance and survivability). The SSN(X) is being developed with a** [**focus on peer conflict readiness**](https://news.usni.org/2025/07/10/report-to-congress-on-ssnx-next-generation-submarine-program)**, stealth superiority, and advanced sensor integration. It is designed to operate in contested environments against near-peer adversaries like China and Russia. While still in early development, the first SSN(X) is expected to be** [**procured around 2040**](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/the-navys-new-ssnx-submarine-summed-up-in-4-words/)**.**

After he walk out, i accidentally bump onto him, he then gave me the 'stare' again. I got scared and afraid and i didnt know what to do. My first action is to report to the management. 

After reporting to management, she (manager) called me to the office to check the CCTV. She then mention he didn't threaten nor attack me in any way and says is just a ""small matter"". The other manager says that is just an accident while the second time was my intention to bump into him as revenge. 

She later says if i made any reports like this again she will saman me and wouldn't layan nor care about my future reports. I apologised to her and the management staff but felt like not enough.

Admiral Hicks was slightly confused. “What are we going to do about the Rigallos?  It’s been over a hundred years. Is there any intel about them?”

Adam put what Sig-San’s team had gathered on the screen as well on the Admiral's and his assistant’s pads.  “As a nation, there are peaceful. Started as a huge importer of meat, products, but then started breeding Genur’s, that’s an elephant-sized cow, and Deniru, a horse-sized chicken.  They are also as intelligent as sheep, so not going for intelligence, more the quality of the meat. They are both delicious. But there are a few who seem to be hunting intelligent life. They have a name for them, Shaginac, and they hunt them. The government is spending a lot on bounty hunters, and they have their own crew hunting them as well.”  Adam said, as he looked around the room. The assistant was reading the intel on the pad and looked up.

“Yes?” Adam asked.

“They use humans as movie monsters? That’s going to make it difficult to interact with them.”

“I got a solution for that. Arus will help their media to paint a different light on humanity. It might take a few years, but he believes he can manage it. They are about to be flooded with positive Human-Rigallos media. And their colony is in serious need of updating when it comes to tech. They are one of the poorer kingdoms in this sector. So trade and aid will also help. They are well aware of their past and know why they got attacked. They call the war ‘the wake-up call.’ And I’m for giving them a chance. But it's your job to convince the Navy not to bomb them back to the Stone Age.” Adam said as he looked back at hicks, who smirked slightly.

“We are not the Nalos, we can give up on a grudge.” The Admiral replied, “Although I have another matter that I know they want to know the answer to. They offered you the whole senate?”

“Oh, that silly matter, yeah, just religious nonsense. Just tell them it was to ensure everything here won't go to hell.”

“How so? You would be their emperor.”

“And one mistake, and it all explodes. Do you want that? What do you think would happen if I don’t fulfill one of those stupid prophecies? Or they might think I take too long doing so? That is a shit show I don’t want. And as I told them, I’m not here to seek power.”

“Those who don't seek power tend to be the best leaders,”  Hicks replied, and Adam stared at him.

“Don’t you start, too.  And if I find out they voted because humanity tricked them into it, then I will… never mind.. just don’t mess with them.”

“You do know there are those back home who will want that done right? We still got Warhawks and expansionists back there. They won't understand why you would turn it down.”

Adam sighed, “I know it's your job to convince them it’s a bad idea. The last thing they want is a whole sector of religious fanatics who believe their emperor is supposed to rule the whole galaxy. They won't accept being ruled by Earth, just me. See the problem?”

“Ah, yeah. That’s an important point. I will do my best, but there are always some idiots.”

The rest of the meeting was just the standard updates, then Adam had to deal with five new diplomatic matters, unaware that he fulfilled a prophecy while doing so.  All he did was give them access to maid droids with a medical program and a cure for a deadly but, according to Hara, easy-to-cure disease they had been struggling with for centuries.   

On the weekend, he went fishing with the ‘boys’ and was baptized by Roks as the emperor of the galaxy by being thrown headfirst off the yacht into the ocean.  They all laughed about the stupidity of just handing away so much power and at Adam for not accepting it.

The following week, he worked hard with Knug and Min-Na to deal with Mugga Corps different attempts to sabotage the upcoming trials.

“The problem is not to drown them in lawsuits. It's time. It might take years.  I still have some cases that I started fifteen years ago. You have to understand that without ironclad evidence, it will take time.” Min-Na said as she sipped the coffee.

“So, we just give up?” Adam asked, a little frustrated.

“Heavens no, each trial takes uptime and can affect your stocks. One or two, even a hundred different cases, aren’t something to worry about. Especially if they are from consumers, it's only when they reach such a number that they are about three to five percent of your client base that the market notices. No, it’s when other companies sue, and if they get past the ‘bullshit’ phase, that the market notices.”

“The bullshit phase?” Adam said, confused, and Knug chuckled as Min-Na continued.

 “The pre-trial phase. It ends when a judge has gone over the rough arguments and agrees there is a case for court. Lots of cases get tossed out before you even get to trial.”

“Oh, yeah, that bullshit phase. Yeah, I heard about it. I just didn’t know it was a galaxy-wide phenomenon. So how do we get past this phase? They covered their tracks very well, from what I understood.”

“Yes, but we are going to spam them with lawsuits, and we are going under one of my hidden lawfirms. They won’t trace it back to us. They are offering their services to companies that pirates have attacked at crucial times for their growth,” She smiled. “We are talking about several hundred. Mostly small firms, some even had earlier made claims of copyright violations, but could not prove how they got hold of the research. That found of the pirate ship opened a floodgate of potential lawsuits. We are going to have some of them demand to interview the pirates you have in prisons to witness against them. Again, we are keeping you out of this. We will make a weak defense against it. On top of that, I have started to headhunt their best lawyers to weaken their stall.”

“So, they will be attacked by angry companies they screwed over, and we have our hands clean? That should break them.”

“Yes, it’s a slow death of a thousand lawsuits; most won’t go anywhere, but they will weaken their stocks.” She replied, and Knug continued.

“Which is where I come in. I have been buying up Mugga shares for a while, from companies that are not on the books. My sister’s friend owns them.  She had this genius idea of pretending to be a Mugga supporter and supporter of the belief that your Burimo. So they recruited her to spy on us, through my sister.  She and my sister have slowly been leading them into more and more trouble.  She feeds them irrelevant intel while finding out who she can feed false intel to.”

“Isn’t that dangerous? If all the intel coming from her is bad, then they won't trust her.” Adam replied. “We know they aren't beyond turning people into flesh droids to spy for them.”

“She is aware of the risk, and we have deliberately let people know we scan everybody as they enter work for just that kind. I lost some good men before they found that one out.”

“Wait, what? Why didn’t I hear anything about it?” Adam looked shocked at him.

“We all lost a few for a while, Sig-San told us that he would take care of it in a manner you would disapprove of, then Jork implemented the scans and it stopped,” Min-Na said and Adam mentally made a note to yell at Sig-San, but apparently it also had worked so maybe he should let it slide.

“Okay. I don’t want to know. What if they find out she is the one who feeds them bad intel? They might just kill her.”

“Oh, that is the genius part of it.  She only gives us the target, and Sig-San sends somebody to work on them and gives them the intel. It works as they sometimes get something that works, small losses for us as bait, and a big one for them when the trap falls.”

“Who came up with this plan?” Adam asked.

“Sida, my sister's friend. She is damn smart.” Knug said, and Min-Na chuckled.

“I think he likes her a little more than the average employee.”

“I appreciate her brains, she is one smart business woman, not bad looking either, but that’s besides the point. She is too strong-willed for me, we would kill each other within a year.” Knug said a little too fast, and Adam chuckled.

“If I remember Wossir’s customs, then you need your boss's permission to marry within the company. I approve. She sounds like a wonderful woman. I’ll even pay for the wedding.” Adam said with a slight grin, and Min-Na burst out laughing.

“Now you have to take her out to ask!”

Knug looked at them with a mix of shock and anticipation.

1mhaoms,https://i.redd.it/zag94q4klzgf1.jpeg,What/Who do I Believe?,"I had kidney stones that needed a stent last year.  First time I was ever tortured like this.  Now, I've had stones before without issue.  Some would pass before I even knew I had them.  But this time I was in so much pain I was kept overnight in the hospital from the ER visit due to continued vomiting.

I want to do whatever it takes to never ever go through that again.  My urologist office gave me a handout (included) last year of foods/drinks to avoid or limit and what is tolerable in moderation.  I changed up my diet entirely based on this...to a point.

When I went back for my yearly follow-up, I was greated by a different doctor.  I told him about the list that office handed out and he was confused.  I said I changed my diet because of it and that I want to never experience anything like that again.  He basically said there's no magic list that makes a difference in stone development/prevention.  He said the doc and nurse I saw last year are no longer there and that I shouldn't worry about what I eat or drink.  Some people are just more prone to getting them and diet doesn't really matter (the only person in my faculty I know if who got them was my uncle nobody else so idk if it's hereditary).   He said just Make sure I drink LOTS of water as that will break down what stones DO develop. 

My question is, do I look for a second opinion or is he onto something?  I remember when I was in the ER my nurse said to just enjoy life because there's nothing you can really do to prevent them, it's what you can do to help make them not grow large is the key.  He said the office main doc, who wants to make money for the office obviously, is pushing to have less and less stone related surgeries as they usually aren't needed and can easily be prevented so he can concentrate on other surgeries.",2,1754306380.0,KidneyStones,3,1.0,False

After that he went silent and deleted his profile without letting me know. Hence, I wrote him a letter and put it in his mailbox.

After several days he texted me, saying that he’s seeing someone (that didn’t work out in the end) but would down to meet for coffee. He rescheduled and we ended up watching movie at his place (we have been flirt texting before we met and he mentioned that the first time is just purely fuck and he didn’t get to know me).

So we ended up watching movie and fuck. I asked for another meeting up before leaving the country and we have had a coffee date. After the coffee we been to a walk and we walked back to his place (he’d asked me if I wanna go upstairs). We cuddle for a bit and I have to leave. Before leaving I told him how I feel (that I have never want someone, but would like to try things with him), he said that he doesn’t believe love at first sight and tend to know the person before going into a relationship.

# Best Fudge Bar Ice Cream 2025: Top Brands Reviewed

Fudge bar ice cream stands as a timeless classic, offering a simple yet satisfying treat that’s notably welcome during warmer months. Its appeal lies in the combination of a creamy, chocolatey interior encased in a refreshing, often slightly icy, exterior. With numerous brands offering their own take on this beloved dessert, discerning which ones deliver the best flavor, texture, and overall experience can be a challenge. This comprehensive review aims to guide consumers through the top fudge bar contenders set to dominate the market in 2025, providing detailed insights into each product's strengths and weaknesses to help you make the perfect choice for your palate.

## Key Features Analysis

**Rich Chocolate Flavor:** The intensity and authenticity of the chocolate flavor is paramount.The best fudge bars utilize high-quality cocoa and chocolate liquor to achieve a deep, complex taste. The richness should be apparent from the first bite, lingering on the palate without any artificial or overly sweet aftertaste.

The quality of cocoa used directly impacts the depth and complexity of flavor. Superior fudge bars will boast a pronounced dark chocolate flavor, balanced by sweetness and sometimes subtle hints of vanilla or coffee to enhance the overall experience. Lower-quality versions may taste overly sugary or have a muted, artificial chocolate flavor.

**Smooth and Creamy Texture:** An ideal fudge bar possesses a smooth, melt-in-your-mouth texture, both inside and out. the interior should be free of ice crystals, indicative of careful production and proper storage. The outer layer, whether it is icy or creamy, should complement the inner core without being grainy or overly hard.

The texture is greatly impacted by the manufacturing process and ingredients used. High-fat content and fine particle size contribute to a smoother mouthfeel. A gritty texture indicates improper emulsification or the presence of ice crystals, detracting from the overall enjoyment.**Balanced Sweetness:** The sweetness level needs to be carefully calibrated to complement the chocolate flavor. A fudge bar that is excessively sweet can mask the nuances of the chocolate, while one that is not sweet enough may taste bitter or bland.

Optimal sweetness enhances the cocoa flavor without being overpowering.The sugar used should be of good quality, avoiding artificial sweeteners or excessive corn syrup which can compromise the overall taste. A well-balanced fudge bar is a symphony of chocolate and sweetness, working in harmony.

**Clean ingredients List:** Consumers are increasingly conscious of the ingredients in their food. The top fudge bars will prioritize natural,recognizable ingredients,avoiding artificial flavors,colors,and excessive preservatives.A shorter, cleaner ingredients list is often a sign of a higher-quality product.

A clear and understandable ingredient list is a hallmark of a superior product. Avoiding artificial additives and prioritizing natural ingredients like real cocoa, milk, and sugar appeals to health-conscious consumers looking for a quality treat that doesn't compromise on health.

**Portion Size and Calorie Count:** The portion size should be satisfying without being excessive. The calorie count should be reasonable for a treat, allowing consumers to indulge without guilt. Smaller bars or those with lower sugar content are becoming increasingly popular.

A reasonable serving size contributes to a balanced dietary approach. Many brands are now offering smaller sized bars or bars with reduced sugar content to cater to the growing demand for healthier dessert options. Openness about nutritional data is crucial for informed consumer choices.

## FAQs Section

**Are Fudge Bars gluten-Free?**
generally, most fudge bars are gluten-free as they typically do not contain wheat, barley, or rye.However, it's crucial to always check the product's label for specific allergen information, as some manufacturing processes may introduce cross-contamination risks. Look for a certified gluten-free label for extra assurance.

**How Should Fudge Bars Be Stored?**
Fudge bars should be stored in the freezer at a consistent temperature to maintain their texture and prevent ice crystal formation. Keep them in their original packaging or in an airtight container to protect them from freezer burn and maintain their flavor. Avoid repeated thawing and refreezing, as this can degrade the product's quality.

**What's the Difference Between a Fudge Bar and a Chocolate Ice Cream Bar?**
While both are frozen chocolate treats, fudge bars typically have a denser, more fudgy texture made from a mixture of cocoa, milk, and sugar. Chocolate ice cream bars, conversely, are made with an ice cream base, resulting in a creamier and often lighter texture. Fudge bars also tend to have a more intense chocolate flavor compared to chocolate ice cream bars.

**Do Fudge Bars Contain Dairy?**
Most customary fudge bars contain dairy, as milk and milk solids are key ingredients to achieving the desired texture and flavor. However, dairy-free alternatives are increasingly available, often made with plant-based milk alternatives like almond milk, soy milk, or coconut milk. Always check the product label if you require a dairy-free option.

# Best Step Coffee 2025: Expert Buying Guide & Reviews

The world of coffee is constantly evolving, with new brewing methods and products emerging to cater to the discerning palettes of coffee lovers. Step coffee, also known as tiered brewing or multi-stage extraction, is gaining traction as an innovative approach to maximize flavor and aroma from coffee grounds. This brewing technique involves separating the brewing process into distinct steps, each designed to extract different compounds from the coffee. The goal is to create a smoother, richer, and more nuanced cup of coffee than traditional single-stage methods allow.

For those seeking the ultimate coffee experience in 2025, selecting the right step coffee system or equipment is crucial. this thorough guide will delve into the best step coffee options available, providing detailed reviews, comparisons, and expert buying recommendations to help you make an informed decision. We will analyze key features, core benefits, and address frequently asked questions to equip you with the knowledge you need to elevate your coffee brewing skills.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a step coffee system or device hinges on its ability to precisely control the brewing process and optimize extraction at each stage.

**Temperature Control:** precise temperature management is paramount for step coffee brewing. Different compounds in coffee grounds extract optimally at specific temperatures. A system with precise temperature control allows users to Target the desirable flavors and minimize the extraction of bitter or undesirable compounds. The ideal system should have a range of adjustable temperatures, typically from 195°f to 205°f, with consistent thermal stability throughout each brewing stage.

**Flow Rate Adjustment:** The rate at which water flows through the coffee grounds dramatically impacts the extraction process.A system capable of adjusting the flow rate allows users to control the extraction time and concentration of each step. Lower flow rates are generally preferred for the initial stages, gently saturating the grounds and extracting the delicate aromatics. As the brewing progresses, the flow rate can be increased to access deeper, richer flavors.

**Brewing Time Segmentation:** Step coffee relies on dividing the brewing process into distinct timed segments, each targeting specific flavor profiles. A system with programmable timers for each step of the brewing process enables users to customize their extraction based on their desired taste. This precision ensures that each stage is optimized for maximum flavor extraction without over-extraction or bitterness.

**Extraction Stage Filtration:** The ability to isolate the extraction from each step is a critical characteristic. Some step-coffee systems incorporate a series of filtration stages where the liquid is transferred after specific brewing times. This design ensures no further extraction occurs during a particular stage after the elapsed time. This ensures a well-defined final brew.

Key features of the Best Step Coffee systems include:

   Precise temperature control
   Adjustable flow rate
   Brewing time segmentation
   Extraction stage filtration

## Core Benefits

Step coffee brewing unlocks a range of benefits that elevate the coffee drinking experience beyond conventional methods.

**Enhanced Flavor Complexity:** by carefully segmenting the brewing process, step coffee allows for a more nuanced and complex flavor profile. The initial stages often extract brighter,more acidic notes,while later stages access richer,more chocolatey flavors. This layered extraction process yields a cup of coffee with greater depth and complexity compared to a single-stage brew.

**Reduced Bitterness:** Step coffee can considerably reduce bitterness. This is achieved by carefully controlling the temperature, flow rate, and extraction time for each step. By avoiding over-extraction of the undesirable bitter compounds, the final brew presents a smoother, more balanced flavor profile.the user can fine-tune these stages to avoid any excessive bitterness.

**Customizable Brewing Experience:** Step coffee empowers users to tailor the brewing process to their individual preferences. The adjustable parameters, that is, temperature, flow rate, and extraction time, for each individual stage allows for experimentation and personalized flavor profiles. This adaptability makes step coffee suitable for a wide range of coffee beans and roasting levels, so individuals can find the best match for their distinctive tastes.

## FAQs Section

**Can any type of coffee bean be used with step coffee brewing?**
Yes, step coffee brewing is compatible with most types of coffee beans. However, different bean varieties and roast levels will respond differently to the stepped extraction process. Experimentation is recommended to find the optimal temperature,flow rate,and brewing time settings for each bean.

**How does step coffee brewing compare to traditional pour-over methods?**
Step coffee brewing offers a more controlled and segmented approach compared to traditional pour-over methods. While pour-over can be highly customizable, it requires a greater degree of manual skill and technique to achieve optimal extraction. Step coffee systems automate the process, ensuring consistent and repeatable results while still offering a high level of customizability.

**Does step coffee require special filters?**
The filter type used with a step coffee system depends on the specific device. Some systems use standard paper filters, while others utilize reusable metal filters. The choice of filter can impact the final flavor profile, with paper filters generally producing a cleaner cup and metal filters allowing for more oils and sediment to pass through.

If I stopped drinking coffee tomorrow, what would the caffeine withdrawal be liked?","My family owned a restaurant when I was growing up, and we lived above it. I was allowed to drink/eat anything we had, but of course wasn't allowed coffee. Being forbidden fruit and all, I wanted coffee most of all.

At first I'd only drink 1 cup (with a shitload of sugar, 5-year old me did NOT like the bitterness), but by age 10 I was drinking about a pot a day. No more late night drinking, I just snuck cups here and there, or made instant on my own if I couldn't get to the coffee pot with my parents around.

Caffeine has been a constant presence in my system all through my formative years. I imagine my brain pretty much considers it a natural part of it's system by now. It doesn't really affect me like other people - for example, I can drink an extra large coffee an hour before bedtime and have no problem falling asleep.

Fan fic Ai made","Chat gpt presents a short, snappy, and witty *fanfic crossover* where **Midge Maisel finishes her last stand-up show**… and bumps into **Lorelai and Rory Gilmore** right as they're starting their journey. A perfect handoff between two iconic fast-talkers:

**INT. BACKSTAGE — CARNEGIE HALL — NIGHT, 1999**

*MIDGE MAIS﻿EL steps off stage, 70-ish, silver curls styled to perfection, still wearing heels no woman her age should be surviving in. The applause from her final show thunders behind her. SU﻿SIE follows with a tissue, sniffling.*

**SUSIE**  
You did it, Midge. The last one. No heart attack, no heckler, no wardrobe malfunction.

**MIDGE**  
I know. I was kind of rooting for a nipple slip—go viral before “viral” becomes a thing.

*They laugh. Just then, Midge bumps—literally—into a woman carrying two coffees and a pop tart.*

**LORELAI GILMORE** (30s, fast, fabulous)  
Whoa! Sorry! I didn’t mean to caffeine-tackle you. You okay?

**MIDGE**  
I’ve been tackled by male comics and shoes from Saks. You’re the softest impact I’ve had all week.

**RORY** (teens, curious)  
Wait, are you... Midge Maisel?

**MIDGE**  
Only when the check clears.

**LORELAI**  
We’re huge fans! I'm Lorelai, this is Rory. We're just about to start our own show. Small town, big coffee addiction, rapid-fire talking.

**MIDGE**  
Oh honey, I’ve made a whole career out of speaking faster than my mother’s disapproval. You’ll do great.

**LORELAI**  
Any advice?

**MIDGE**  
Always wear lipstick. Never date your manager. And if someone tells you women aren't funny—hand them your mic... *and walk away while it’s still hot.*

**RORY**  
You’re a legend.

**MIDGE**  
No, dear, I’m a *warning label with pearls.*

*They all laugh. The stage door opens. Lorelai and Rory step through it.*

**LORELAI**  
Your curtain call is our pilot episode. How poetic is that?

**MIDGE**  
Try not to trip over my punchlines on the way up.

*Fade out as Midge watches them walk into the future, sipping her martini, smiling.*

A divine entity had sent him into this world because it was being attacked by a force from beyond—and more or less everybody would die here or at best be enslaved. Leon stood on the balcony of Thalasson’s citadel. He was a Reincarnator.  Did he have to save this world? Well yes an no.

The island of Thalasson and its capital were surrounded by mana shields. The extinct humans of this world had built mana generators that recharged themselves. The shields would therefore never run out of power. It seemed he personally was safe. But not everybody else.

Leon turned around and walked through the unused, abandoned Senate chamber -made of marble and gold- of Thalasson, a relic of humanities culture and power. He continued even higher and reached his office—the office of the Consul of Thalasson, an absurdly large office with a big desk in it that somehow seemed in comparison small and meaningless.   
  
As the only human here, he was not just a consul with presidential powers, he was effectively the dictator of Thalasson. But since the only ""citizens"" were flesh golems and automatons, he didn’t feel like a true ruler. More like a lone survivor in a mechanized city.

He skimmed through inventory lists. In theory, he had a small army of security automatons. A decent fleet of ships. Even flying machines, not like the fighter jets of his former Earth, but they looked more like sci-fi star-fighters maybe because they were powered by magic and not by the mechanical technology he remembered from earth. And also he had golem-sized automatons built for combat and construction.   
  
What he lacked, however, were crew members and true companions. He had not been a politician or strategist in his old life but an engineer. Running an entire civilization alone seemed... daring, to say the least.

The problem was that the humans—brought down by a fertility crisis—had mentally castrated the flesh golems they created from human and elven DNA. They were unemotional. Passionless. With only minimal self-preservation instincts and average intelligence and reflexes. That made it impossible for them to use complex or Legendary magic.

A13 entered the office. A humanoid automaton who had helped him from the beginning.

""Master Fenno. I have brought the documents you requested.""That was his name—or rather, the name of this body—when he was awakened from cryosleep. Fenno Cavil, a member of Thalasson’s elite, had frozen himself to escape death while the automatons worked to find the cause of humanity’s fertility crisis. Remarkably, they had succeeded.

""Thank you, A13. Can we create new flesh golems the way I envisioned them? Smarter, with proper self-preservation instincts, better reflexes—to serve as effective soldiers, pilots, and mages—but still loyal?""

""Master. If you increase their autonomy, complete loyalty can no longer be guaranteed. However, we can still integrate a deep loyalty to you into their mental architecture. This should make rebellion effectively impossible. Additionally, we should deactivate the reproductive capability of the golems. Golems capable of creating more golems could become a threat to the world if something goes wrong.""

Leon did not want to ask how exactly A13 wanted to program loyalty into the new Flesh Golems. He was already overwhelmed by all he had to manage. ""I understand. Thank you, A13. Can we begin producing a batch of golems with the new specifications?""

""Yes, Master. I anticipated your wishes and have already prepared everything. However, only one of the two breeding factories is still operational. That limits our generation size to 500 units, which require two months of maturation before they are ready.""

""Begin the process immediately.""

""Understood. I have also come because an event requires your attention. Thirteen minutes ago, a ship emerged from a storm and is now drifting outside the island’s shield, in coastal waters. According to data from our spy birds, it is a war galleon from the Elven Kingdom of Evora. It shows clear signs of battle damage. Shapes were seen on deck, but there has been no activity. They are either dead or unconscious.""

""Do we have any small ship we can use to board it?""

""Small? No. But a light cruiser named *Solana* has just been fully overhauled. It is roughly the same size as the galleon and is ready for immediate deployment. However, the *Solana* only has a minimal crew of older flesh golems and a team of security automatons. I advise against going personally. You are the last remaining human.""

""I will go. I need to see the world beyond the shield with my own eyes. I’ve spent an entire week sitting at this desk, trying to understand how this world works and who the Legion is. I need answers—firsthand. Not just photos from those mechanical birds flying around the world for us.""

""Understood, Master. I will assign you a contingent of Senate Guard automatons for personal protection.""

""Thank you, A13. You should accompany me as well.""

""Gladly, Master.""

My Epic Quest, Weird Confessions, and the REAL Ways to Win Big—HELP!","Guys, I have a question (and maybe a weird confession)... How DO you actually get gift cards these days?! Is it just me or are there like, a million ways but also feels like I can never quite nail a method that works consistently? 

Don’t get me wrong—I LOVE gift cards.  
Starbucks, Amazon, PlayStation…something about those cards feels like someone handing you happiness in a rectangular package.
But every time I start searching “how to get gift cards” I kind of spiral down dozens of weird internet rabbit holes—am I missing some secret shortcut?

Here’s some stuff I’ve seen (and sometimes tried? maybe regretted?!):

- *Surveys*: I’ve spent HOURS answering questions about toothpaste.  
  That little notification saying “Congratulations! You earned 25 points!” gets old fast.
- *Cashback Apps*: So you spend money to get a little money back? Wait, is this a trick or am I genuinely saving (or just buying coffee I didn’t need…)?
- *Online Reads/Tasks*: Websites claim they’ll reward you for reading or watching ads,  
  but I usually get a headache clicking through, and BOOM—“This offer is not available in your region.” WHY?!
  
I even read on https://goodnovel.org/ somewhere that reward cards are “easy” to score, but I must be doing something wrong!

Has anyone ACTUALLY gotten a decent gift card from these things? I’m talking $10+, not just those shady “here’s a code, hope you like getting spammed forever!” ones.
 
Seriously! Sometimes it feels like you need a PhD in internet scavenging.

- *Buying Discounted Gift Cards*: Has anyone tried those “gift card marketplace” sites?  
Good deals or kind of sketchy??
- *Playing Games*: I tried the “play this app, get a reward!” thing and my phone battery didn’t survive the week.
  
I mean, all I wanted was a cozy cup of coffee at Starbucks paid for by my own gift card hustle. Instead, my screen time report just yells at me.

But! A secret hack I randomly saw is reading stories to EARN cards?  
Is this real or some “too good to be true” Internet myth? Supposedly places like https://goodnovel.org/ give you rewards for reading. Okay, I read anyway. This could be worth a bookmark, no?

Right now, I’m basically:

- Clicking random “earn points” offers
- Getting excited, then giving up
- Repeat

Is it just trial and error? Is there ACTUALLY a magic formula to earn legit, not-covered-in-viruses gift cards? Please—if you know it, I beg you to spill the tea. Tips, anecdotes, or just commiseration encouraged!

And if by some miracle, someone’s used https://goodnovel.org/ or other legit reading sites and gotten a REAL, working code—please confirm I’m not alone in this quest!",1,1754305069.0,LuxuryGiftsf,0,1.0,False
1mha946,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mha946/aita_for_cutting_off_a_girl_i_cared_about_because/,AITA for cutting off a girl I cared about because I got tired of mixed signals and no clarity?,"I met B last year and we hit it off naturally. Things felt mutual and light in the beginning, we spent time together, talked a lot, and everything seemed to flow. I developed feelings for her not because of how she looked, but because of how she made me feel calm, accepted and understood. I was clear about my emotions from the start, and I always tried to communicate with honesty and openness.

After a while, she started to distance herself. She said she felt anxious about being in a relationship, and that her friend (let's call her A), who we were both close with, told her she would feel uncomfortable if we were together. That felt off to me. At first, I thought she just needed time, but eventually I realized she was using A as a shield to avoid dealing with her own hesitations. She never told me directly how she truly felt, I had to pull things out of her. She acted like I already knew everything, but I didn’t. I just kept guessing.

When I ended things, I told her that I needed someone who knows what they want and I still stand by that. I didn’t want to be in a one-sided situation where I’m constantly reading between the lines. After months of spending time together, I think both people should have clarity about whether they want to move forward or not.

We stopped talking, and I found out later that A was apparently uncomfortable with our connection because I had “talked to one of her friends” before, which is not true at all. She never said that to me directly, and when I broke things off with B, out of respect, I also stopped all contact with A because I didn’t want to be around anyone who would talk behind my back or try to sabotage something real.

B never stepped up to take initiative or show me she wanted things to work. And over time, I stopped trusting that her reasons were genuine. I started seeing her behavior as avoidance more than anything else.

A few months later, we did finally meet for coffee. She admitted that she hadn’t been fair to me, and that I had treated her with nothing but respect. That moment gave me a kind of closure but it didn’t fix what had already been broken. Because no matter how many chances I gave, it always ended the same. She would initiate something… and then disappear.

That time, she told me she’d call me the next week to go running, something we used to do together, but she never did. She did send a message later, but it felt like she was still waiting for me to make the next move again, as if she expected me to carry the dynamic like before. But I didn’t want to anymore. I believe things like this should be mutual. I had done enough of the reaching out.

There were also moments that made me question her emotional maturity, for example, when we broke things off the first time, she told me she had ""tested me"" and that I had “failed the test” and would ""regret it"". That shocked me. I don’t believe in playing games or testing people. I just want open communication and emotional honesty. Later, she even contacted me suggesting we do a project together, which sounded great at the time… but again, nothing came of it. Just words without action.

She ended up at the same New Year’s gathering as me (through mutual friends), and the tension was obvious. It felt like she wanted to talk but still hadn’t done anything to resolve the things that mattered. I stayed quiet because I was exhausted by the idea of once again being the one to start the conversation.

I’ve realized now that I don’t want to keep showing up for someone who’s not showing up for me. It’s not about pride or ego, it’s about peace. I still care for her as a person. I just can’t keep investing energy into something that leaves me feeling confused and unseen.

**TL;DR:**  
Things started off great with a girl I liked. Over time, she distanced herself and blamed it on external reasons. I tried to understand, but she never communicated openly. I ended things, but she kept initiating contact without real follow-through. After several chances and no change, I’ve chosen to let go. I want mutual effort, clarity, and emotional maturity, not guesswork and one-sidedness.",5,1754305024.0,AITAH,2,0.86,False
1mha8v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1mha8v8/rushing_gold_mine_in_misery/,Rushing Gold Mine in Misery,"Holy guacamole, what a ride! This weekend I started playing Misery after some time off from TLD. My usual Loper stragety is to raw dog the climb to the gold mine asap and build my save from there. I reckoned it might be similar with misery cold-wise and the starting point in PV is excellent. Boy was I wrong. I died four times in the first night, sometimes not even reaching mountaineers hut.

This mode is excellent, finally I don't need to minmax my resources because I might need them sometime in the distant future, but the goal is actually immediate survival. Very immersive. Today I actually got to the Mine! The route was PV plane crash Site, the cellar of the burnt down house nearby, bunker near rope to TWM, Mountaineer's hut, Angler's Den, then raw dog the climb. I had to savescum twice, first time I went the wrong path from Angler's den and realized it too late. Then I ran out of stamina before reaching the ledge on the last rope climb. However, I finally managed the climb with no bedroll and no coffee/stim. I started from Angler's den with full sleep meter. Heat up in the cave near the first rope climb. Do the first rope climb. Sleep in the shelter until sleep meter is full. Disassemble shelter (I brought no cloth! Also had to rip apart my socks...), take second cope climb, build shelter and fire, sleep for as long as you fuel permits, empty your inventory of any fuel and burn it. Do the last climb. I almost didn't make it. Then untie the rope do the tired shuffle to the gold mine, descend and reach the gold mine in the first light of day. 

What a ride! I only had my two empty cans, a can of dog food, 20 matches and my clothes on me in the end. Starving, freezing, tired, with 30% condition left. Then I ate like a king, slept 10 hours and am now in a pretty comfortable place :)

 Then she started slapping my naked ass, and giving me the odd squeeze with her thighs, saying today is a lesson you need to learn, as you have been a really naughty boy, hasn’t he girls, and they all laughed. As she continued slapping my ass, I felt something wet being poured over my cheeks and running down my ass crevice, and she then started rubbing it into my ass, before she leaned over me and picked up her wooden hairbrush off the table, and  brought the hairbrush down on my ass. 
It stung as my ass was wet, and I squirmed and I glanced over at her friend and granddaughter, who were watching intensely, her granddaughter looked a bit bemused, while her friend seemed to have a serious fascination. After a dozen or so smacks on alternating cheeks, getting harder and harder, I said that fucking hurts, and she replied did I tell you to speak, and she started smacking my ass cheeks and inner thighs one slap of the brush after another. 
I again said fuck that hurts and she said I’ll teach you to fucking swear at me, you naughty little boy, and she slid the brush handle down between my ass cheeks, pushing it up my ass, in one slick movement, and I jumped and cringed, but as my ass was moist with whatever she had put on it, the brush slid in easily, and I said what the fuck are you doing, and she said I’ll show you, and she slowly pushed it in and out of my ass saying, don’t you ever, ever swear at me again. Then her granddaughter said it looks like someone is enjoying that, look at his fucking cock between your thighs, it’s like an iron bar, he obviously likes to be punished. 
Then as my neighbour pushed her brush in and out of my ass, and squeezed my cock and balls between her thighs, I lost all control, and without any warning I cum, and shot cum over her thighs, rope after rope, and I heard squeals of excitement from the friend and granddaughter. Then my neighbour pulled out her brush and said I’m going to let you up now, but you have got to stand in the corner for a while, with your shorts off, and as long as you're quiet and behave yourself I will let you know when you can rejoin us.
 And so I don’t know why but I did, with my ass sore inside and out, while the three of them chatted and whispered, and I listened to what I could hear, but I couldn’t hear it all, so I stared at the wall, then after a while, my neighbour walked over to me and said keep your shorts off and sit with us, and to my surprise, I was told to sit between her friend and granddaughter. Then my neighbour said you were a good boy today, so you deserve a treat, and nodded to her granddaughter, and said you wanted to, and she promptly grabbed my cock and jerked me off till I covered my own thighs with my cum, before I was dismissed and told I could go home.

Options include polyurethane, lacquer, and oil-based finishes, each offering different levels of durability and sheen. A properly applied finish ensures the table remains beautiful and functional for years to come.

**Size and Dimensions:** Live edge epoxy tables come in a variety of sizes and shapes,from small coffee tables to large dining tables. the dimensions of the table should be carefully considered to fit the intended space and accommodate the number of users.

# Best Soapstone Coasters 2025: Reviews & Buying Guide

Soapstone coasters are an increasingly popular choice for protecting furniture from moisture and heat damage.They offer a natural,elegant aesthetic while providing excellent functionality. This guide will explore teh best soapstone coasters available in 2025, highlighting their key features, benefits, and ideal user profiles, helping you make an informed purchasing decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and performance of soapstone coasters depend on several crucial features.

**Material & Construction:** The grade of soapstone used significantly impacts its durability and heat resistance.Higher-grade soapstone is denser and less porous, making it more effective at absorbing moisture and withstanding temperature changes. A well-made coaster will have smooth, even surfaces and edges, free from cracks or chips. The thickness of the stone also matters; thicker coasters tend to be more durable and offer better insulation.

The construction often includes a backing material,such as cork or felt,to provide a non-slip surface and further protect furniture from scratches. The quality of this backing material is also significant; it should be securely attached to the soapstone and resistant to wear and tear. Some coasters are designed with a slight lip or edge to contain condensation and prevent it from spilling onto the furniture.

**Absorbency:** One of the key benefits of soapstone is its natural absorbency. This allows the coasters to effectively soak up condensation from cold drinks, preventing water rings and other damage to tables and surfaces. the absorbency rate can vary depending on the quality and density of the soapstone. A good coaster will be able to absorb a significant amount of moisture without becoming saturated quickly.

Some manufacturers treat the soapstone to enhance its natural absorbency, while others leave it in its natural state. It's critically important to consider whether the coaster is treated or untreated, as this can affect its performance and maintenance requirements. Untreated soapstone may require occasional oiling to maintain its appearance and absorbency.**Size & Shape:** The size and shape of soapstone coasters are critically important considerations for both functionality and aesthetics. A coaster that is to small may not adequately protect the surface from larger glasses or mugs. Conversely, a coaster that is too large may look out of proportion or take up too much space on the table.Common shapes for soapstone coasters include round, square, and octagonal. The choice of shape is largely a matter of personal preference, but it's important to consider how the shape will complement the overall aesthetic of your decor. The thickness varies but averaging around 1/4 to 3/8 inches provides ample protection and longevity for general use.

**Heat Resistance:** soapstone is known for its excellent heat resistance,making soapstone coasters suitable for hot beverages as well as cold ones. The stone can withstand high temperatures without cracking or discoloring, protecting the surface beneath from heat damage.The heat resistance of the soapstone depends on its composition. Many commercially available sets are able to withstand temperatures experienced as high as 400 degrees Fahrenheit.

However, it's important to note that prolonged exposure to extreme heat may still cause some discoloration or damage over time. It's generally recommended to avoid placing extremely hot items directly on the coasters for extended periods. Always read the manufacturer's recommendations for safe usage.

## Core Benefits

Soapstone coasters offer a range of practical benefits for protecting furniture and enhancing the aesthetic appeal of any space.

**Protection Against Moisture Damage:** The primary benefit of soapstone coasters is their ability to protect furniture from moisture damage. Their natural absorbency allows them to quickly soak up condensation from cold drinks,preventing water rings,stains,and warping of wooden surfaces. This is particularly important for delicate or antique furniture that is susceptible to water damage.

using soapstone coasters ensures that your furniture stays in pristine condition, even when serving cold drinks on hot days. The prevention of water rings alone saves time and effort cleaning and maintaining furniture, extending its lifespan.

**Heat Insulation:** Soapstone is also an excellent insulator, making these coasters ideal for protecting surfaces from hot beverages. Hot coffee mugs, tea cups, and other hot items can leave unsightly heat rings or even scorch the surface of furniture. Soapstone coasters provide a barrier that prevents this damage, keeping your furniture looking its best.this is particularly useful for surfaces that are sensitive to heat, such as varnished wood or delicate finishes. The heat resistance capabilities extend the coaster's utility beyond cold drinks, making them a versatile and practical addition to any home.

**Aesthetic Appeal:** Unlike other types of coasters, soapstone coasters offer a natural, elegant aesthetic that complements a wide range of decor styles. The smooth, gray surface of the stone has a subtle and sophisticated look that adds a touch of class to any setting. Whether your style is modern, rustic, or conventional, soapstone coasters can enhance the overall visual appeal of your space.

The natural variations in the stone's color and texture make each coaster unique,adding to their charm. They are a functional accessory and a decorative element, contributing to the overall ambiance of a room.

## FAQs Section

**How do I clean soapstone coasters?**
Cleaning soapstone coasters is generally simple. For minor spills or condensation, wipe the surface with a damp cloth.For more stubborn stains, use a mild soap and warm water. avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, which can damage the stone. After cleaning, allow the coasters to air dry completely before storing them.

**Do soapstone coasters need to be oiled?**
Whether or not you need to oil your soapstone coasters depends on whether they are treated or untreated. Untreated soapstone may benefit from occasional oiling with mineral oil to maintain its appearance and enhance its absorbency. To oil, simply apply a small amount of mineral oil to the surface of the coaster and rub it in evenly with a soft cloth.Wipe off any excess oil. Treated soapstone coasters may not require oiling, but it's always a good idea to check the manufacturer's recommendations.

**Can soapstone coasters be used outdoors?**
Yes, soapstone coasters can generally be used outdoors.Soapstone is a durable and weather-resistant material that can withstand exposure to the elements. However,it's important to protect the coasters from extreme temperatures and direct sunlight,which can cause them to crack or discolor over time. It is important to bring the coasters indoors if they will be subject to any risk of freezing, as liquid retained in the pores of the stone could cause fractures.

You didn’t want her to think that just because you were ready now – you expected her to be there waiting for you to reach over. If you two were going to be okay again, it wouldn’t just be on your own terms, you want her to be ready to forgive you too.



Except the forgiveness doesn’t come.



You should have seen it - at breakfast, she was there, but not really. You asked her to go on a grocery run, one of her favourite things to do. She only smiles, but it doesn’t reach her eyes as she says no, thank you. And you understand, of course. Her terms too, not just yours.



You look forward to getting back with apologies, her favourite mochi, boxed macarons, and prawn dumplings– but you open the door to an empty home without a note.



Three days later, you decide it’s enough, and you finally know where to go.

Listener POV:



He broke your heart with words.



It wasn’t infidelity. It wasn’t a resentment thing, not abuse, not an attack. But the words hit a specific, tender area of your heart that was hurt in your younger years and was still healing.



He hit it square with his words. 



You felt something break. You’re unsure if the whiplash was because it was so sudden, or because you didn’t expect that part of you to still hurt, or because it was HIM. Him who had been so gentle, so understanding, so… reassuring that he wouldn’t hurt you.



But here you were.



You walk away, stay on your side of the bed, facing away from his. You hear him come in. You feel the ghost of his hand hover near your back, aching to touch you, but you don’t lean into it. You feel him withdraw and sigh a weak, barely-audible apology. His weight moves the mattress. You stay on each of your sides. It hurts all over again, but maybe you don’t want it. You’re not sure what you want. Do you forgive him? Let him back in? Or for once, do you choose yourself?



You wake up the next morning. His eyes are apologetic. You wait for him to say it. Instead you get an invite to the groceries.



Ah, sweeping it all under the rug, just like the parents did.



No. You’re not allowing it. Not this time.



As he leaves for the store, you find everything. You’ve always been half-packed because you always knew this day would come.



You always knew the other shoe would drop, You just wish being prepared for it made it hurt less.



It doesn’t.



You leave.

***~~“OK, ALMOND, WHAT’S YOUR PROBLEM?”~~***



I don’t know. But it’s OUR problem now.



Jokes! Usually these scripts do okay. And I don’t have access to therapy at the moment so instead of typing paragraphs on ChatGPT I’m just letting it out here, haha, then maybe have a VA verbalise it.



As always - I’m always happy to see fills for my scripts, but if you will tweak anything in my story, especially around plot, PLEASE REACH OUT FIRST! Minor changes in dialogues are fine, gendered flips are fine. But story wise, please don’t do any major changes without advising me.



**TLDR:**



**OK:** Monetisation / Gender flip



**NOT OK:** Changing plot without advising me.

  
Script starts after the break.

\[door opening, slow footsteps\]



Baby?



\[deep sigh\]



(softer) Baby?



\[listener does not move or answer.\]



Okay. Maybe you’re asleep. It *is* pretty late.



I won’t wake you up. You need sleep and rest too.



And maybe space because I was an asshole to you.



Babe?



\[listener gives him nothing\]



I love you.



\[sheets rustle\]



(whispers) I’m sorry, baby.



Gosh, I want to just reach out and–



\[rustling sheets as he reaches for listener\]



*Never mind. I might just push her away even more.*



Good night.



\*\*\*



\[yawns\]



Gosh. My chest feels heavy.



\[groans, stretching\]



Congrats on bringing this upon yourself, you asshole.



God. You knew she hated it when people lash out at her. You knew what her mum did to her, and you do the exact same?

\[rustling as speaker throws off his blanket.\]



I need to make this right. Maybe make her some breakfast? We have some of those mushrooms she likes. I can whip up an omelet or something.



\[door opens\]



That smells… amazing. Baby?



How long have you been up? (nervous)



Oh.



\[slow footsteps\]



I was hoping–



OH! Ok, ok! Hot pan! I’ll get out of the way…



That looks good honey… careful with the pan… yup… straight to the table then.



What did you put in here? Mmm. It makes my stomach grumble. (overdoing it)



Thanks for making breakfast, baby. Can I–



Oh. Yep. Yes ma’am, I’ll sit down.



Coffee? Uh… sure. The purple capsule, yes. I can make it for us instead if you–



Right. You’re already there. Ok. Anything I can help you with maybe?



Sit… Well. Okay.



\[coffee cup set down and chair pulled\]



Thanks for making this.



Hey, um, about last night. I didn’t mean to snap.



It’s not okay. I shouldn’t have snapped and said–



No, I need to say this. Please. I didn’t mean any of it.



I appreciate that you understand that I had a bad day. And you know how Andrew gets with me when something doesn’t go his way. But it isn’t a good enough reason to take it out on you and… basically call you an attention seeker.



What do you mean it’s fine?



You need me to… drop it?



Ok. But just for today, all right? I need to make it up to–



Right. Sorry.



(Optional Inner Monologue: *Maybe she just needs space. That sounds fair. I don’t want to push her further away. She seems really hurt. I could feel it.*)



\[pause. Fill with cutlery sounds of them eating. It’s awfully quiet.\]



Do we still have those dumplings you like?



The prawn ones? What about the soup dumplings?



Ok. I’m thinking of doing a Costco run today so just running over things. But you can always just point the things you want out like we usually do. That’s okay too.



What?



You don’t want to annoy me today so you won’t go…?



You’re not annoying me at all, sweetie.



Okay. \[*clears throat. He know’s that’s loaded. Improv if you need, VA.\]*  Um. I was thinking you could go with me, please? And we can grab pizza afterwards?



No?



But why?



Oh. OH. You have a call with your Europe counterparts tonight and you need to prep. I forgot about the reporting you’ve been doing the past few weeks...



\[clears throat\]



I’m sorry. We can go tomorrow instead, then?



No? I mean, yes we need to get detergent soon and we’re out of dishwasher tablets but…



\[sigh\]



Okay. I’ll go alone then. Anything else I could get? Your sparkling water’s nearly out too.



All right… but… are you sure you don’t want to come? We can do a speed run. 30 minutes tops? I just… with all my overtime and you preparing for that Europe call… I’ve just missed doing things with you. Normal things. And last night I know you were trying to spend time with me and I… um…



Yup. Sorry. You did ask me to drop it. I’m sorry.



These scrambled eggs are awesome, baby. Thank you.



\[finishes food, cutlery, chairs scraping\]



I’ll go in a bit then, best to avoid traffic. Maybe get petrol filled for the car too.



Are you… are you sure you don’t want to do a speed run? We can get a bag of that salted chocolate pretzels…?



Okay, sweetie. I understand.



\[sigh\]



I’ll get going then.



Anything you want… anything at all you think of, just text me and I’ll get it for you.



I love you.



\[footsteps, keys, door\]



\[car sound\]



\*\*\*



\[bags rustling\]



Oh my goodness, I CANNOT believe I finally got a hold of this steak she liked!



It’s been out of stock for months! I can’t wait to tell her.



\[keys into lock\]



BAAABE!



Babe! Wait. Did she get a nap? Gosh, she has that call she needs to attend, hopefully I can wake her up in time for it.



\[puts down bags on the counter\]



The house is quiet. I wonder what she’s up to?It’s so clean…? 



Babe! \[knocks on door\] Are you there?



\[more knocking\]



I’m coming in!



\[door opens\]



Wait. She’s not here either…



It’s too clean. What’s going on. Baby? **BABY?**



\[panicked, hurried footsteps around the house. Show worry and breaths being shorter.\]



Where are her shoes?



\[open bathroom door\]



Her hairbrush. Her tools. Makeup. Skincare basket. All gone. \[open cupboard and closets\] her clothes too.



Fuck. She won’t… she… she would have left a note, right?



\[denial. Improv as needed?\]



\[rings phone, voicemail message\]



Fuck.



\[rings phone, another voicemail message\]



Baby, I know I should have asked. I know I should have apologised better. But leaving? Not even a note?



\[deep breaths to steady himself\]



Please. Just call me back. I just… i just want to hear your voice. If you need space that’s okay, but I just want to know if you’re safe. Please.



\[voice cracks\]



I know I messed up, but call me back. Or at least text. I need to know you’re okay. I love you.



\[deep breath\]



I love you. I’ll wait for you.



\[beep. More breaths to steady himself. Footsteps.\]

\[clock ticking sfx. three days later - phone rings\]



\[click — phone connects\]



Hello? 



Oh my god. Is she with you? Hey, I—



...She's there?



Thank you. Thank you for calling. I’ve been out of my mind.



Is she okay? No, don’t tell me. Actually… wait, is she safe? That’s all I need to know.



Okay. Okay. I’ll come by. I’d dropped by your house out west the other day but…



The vineyard? You’re both at the vineyard in the valley then? Okay. Can you text me the address?



I won’t cause a scene. I just… I just want to see her. Talk to her, if she’ll let me.



Thank you. Seriously. Thank you.



\[click — call ends\]

\[car sound. Bags rustling as he takes them out of the boot. birds chirping as he enters the vineyard.\]



Good morning, sir.



Yes, I brought the goods. Smoked salmon. Spinach. Bacon, eggs… yes, I know I didn’t have to. But if I was going to make it right, I should start by NOT taking anything from your farm. At least not until your daughter forgives me.



Beautiful vineyard, by the way. She’d been asking me to come with her and visit…



But I’d been swamped with clients… and quite short with her, to be honest. 



I’m sorry.



I know I should apologise to her, but I need to say sorry to you too. I promised not to hurt your daughter.



Thank you. For calling me. For letting me know where she was.



Miserable? \[light, mirthless laugh\]



But she’d probably have been more miserable if she stayed.



That’s what I plan to fix today, yes.



\[door creaking open as speaker is led into the house/ kitchen\]



Thanks again. I’ll make breakfast and… yep, you’ll just be at the patio. Ok sir. Coffee at the carafe… pans and ladles here… alright. I shouldn’t take too long.



\*\*\*



\[cutlery sounds, plates being put away\]



Yes, sir. You can leave the dishes with me. Us.



\[clears throat as listener looks at him\]



Or just me. That works too.



You’ll do the dishes with me? \[hopeful\]



Yes. Okay. Thank you. 

  
Okay, sir.



\[her dad leaves. plates, cutlery, glasses, water SFX as they wash dishes\]



Hey.



Your dad called me, by the way. I didn’t trespass. Or force anything.



I’m hoping at one shot at redemption.



I missed you.



Even now that you’re standing next to me. I fucking miss you.



Don’t what?



I know you don’t want to talk to me. I wouldn’t either.



But I need to say this. And then you can tell me to leave. Or tell me how much I hurt you—honestly, I probably need to hear all of that. But I also want to understand why I came back home to find you gone.



Your stuff. Your shoes. Your skincare basket? All gone. Like you were never there. You deleted yourself from my life like one of those crazy line by line data imports you do at work.



Hey, I know I messed up. I didn’t just snap. I \*chose\* to snap. I let myself boil over, and I knew \*exactly\* where to hit. And I said it anyway.

All while knowing exactly what it was that you were afraid of. Knowing how much work we both put in to pull you out of your shell. To let your guard down. To trust me.

Only to drive the knife so deep you didn’t even put up a fight when you left.



\[turn off water\]



I KNOW! I know, okay? I know what I did. I know how I messed up. I know I made it feel unsafe for you to be hurt or be vulnerable or just… be. 



And then I shut it out. I saw you hurting.



I know. I know I hurt you and I’m…



I’m sorry. I’m so fucking sorry.



I saw you fold in. Shrink. I *didn’t* know what to say.



It was killing me, seeing you smile that morning like I didn’t just break something between us. You think I didn’t *feel* the distance? That it didn’t eat me alive?



I was scared! \[heavy breaths, pause\] I thought if I pressed, you’d pull further away. I thought I already lost you. I didn’t want to make it worse. 



I didn’t want to push and make you feel that I was hovering around because I was okay now and we were going to be good just on my terms. You were angry enough at me, rightfully, and I didn’t want to worsen that by pushing it. If we were going to be okay, it was going to be on **your** terms too.



I wasn’t shutting you out. I’m sorry. I should have communicated that better. I thought I was giving you space. I thought I was letting you breathe. And I know now that it came out as me shrugging you off, and it’s just one more thing on the list I need to make up to you for.



I… made you feel that your pain was a burden?



Fuck… that’s not…



I know I hit that tender bruise where your mum’s pain stayed and I’m so sorry I realised it too late. I made you feel small. Like she did. Like you needed to shrink for my comfort.



And you felt the only way to be safe was to leave. Honestly... I made it so easy for you to go.



Not because you don’t love me.



But because I made our home feel unsafe.



Then I came home after the grocery run thinking I could fix it with groceries and good intentions.



And you were gone.



You were \*gone\*, and it was like someone had punched a hole through my ribs.



I’m sorry. I don’t know what else to say except I’m sorry. Not just for snapping. Not just for brushing it off.



I’m sorry I didn’t ask. I should’ve asked. I *felt* it—I knew something cracked—but I convinced myself pretending it wasn’t broken would make it go away.



I should’ve said something. Anything. Even if it was messy. Even if it was wrong. And I’m saying it now because I *need* you to know—I don’t want to be the person who makes you feel like you have to disappear to be heard.



\[sfx of him reaching for her hand\]



\[voice softer\] Please tell me next time. Even if I don’t have the right words yet. Even if I get it wrong. I want to listen. I *will* listen. I won’t always know what to say—I *never* know what to say, actually—but I will sit with you in it. I’ll hold it with you. Even if it hurts.



I’m not here to ask you to come home if you’re not ready. But I need you to know that I’ve booked therapy. I’ve talked to Andrew and he’s letting me take the back seat with some of our clients.



I’m sorting this out. I’m serious about this, and I need you to know that.



If you need months of space or just this vineyard and the sun for a while—I get it. But if there was a chance… any chance at all that you could let me make it up to you…



You… you would?



I… of course I looked for you. Three days. All of those three days I’d been losing it. I even tried your boss. She told me to f\*ck off.



I mean, I deserved it. You’d been asking me to come visit and it’s completely on me when I didn’t know where this was.



Of course I looked for you. Our home didn’t feel like one without you there. I’d… I look for you in every room. Since the day we met, I’d been looking for you in every room, in every moment.



In every hour I’m awake. I notice when your voice goes quiet. I feel it when your smile doesn’t reach your eyes. I see you. Even when you try to vanish.



And I *hate* that I made you feel like I don’t. I hate that I let you carry it alone. I *will* look for you. Every single day of my life. Even when it’s hard. Especially when it’s hard.



And I’ll keep saying it. I’ll keep making it up to you. I’ll keep working so this mistake doesn’t destroy what we’d worked so hard for. I’ll keep choosing you. Looking for you. As long as you let me.



You will?



\[relieved sigh\]



Come here.



\[hug sfx\]



I love you.



I know I said it already. I just want it on record in case you disappeared again.



I missed you so fucking much.



\[fabric sfx\]



I know you’re not letting me off the hook just yet. And I’m more than happy to start the groveling now.



I can start? By... by helping your dad fill bottles at the cellar?



Right. On it, Ma’am. I’ll go right now. I’ll see you when we’ve corked the last bottle of shiraz.



\[relieved sigh, small laugh\]



\[footsteps\]



What?



Wait here? Why? Did you need me to–



\[listener kisses speaker\]



Oh. I don’t think I’ve earned that yet, but thank you.



\[speaker kisses listener this time\]



Yes. I’ll steal a bottle of shiraz for you when we’re done.



And then we… what? \[unable to believe what she said\]



Go… home? You’re coming home with me?



\[small sigh + laugh\]



No, no, of course I want you to!



This is more than I’d ever hoped for.



Thank you, baby. Now let me go so I can steal your bottle of red.



\[kisses, laughs, improv whatever\].

Memories work in interesting ways. Some from a decade past are clear and vivid and last week could be a fog. There are periods  time erased, however the past has shallow graves. It only takes a few words to bring everything back to the surface.

For me, it was my mother’s voice at the kitchen table.

“Do you remember your imaginary friend?” she asked, stirring her coffee, thinking back to what she thought was childhood whimsy.

And just like that, the name crawled out from the dark.

Mister Stranger.

It didn’t feel like a memory. It felt like waking up mid-conversation with something you’d forgotten you were listening to. Most people recall flashes from early childhood an emotion, a birthday, a toy. I remember him. And I think he remembers me.

He came during the year I was homeschooled. Lonely doesn’t even cover it. I had no friends, no playmates. My parents were good people, just… busy. I lived in silence, days swallowed by the buzz of a box fan and the creak of a two-story house.

Until he came.

It started with a tapping.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I was six. I remember it was past midnight. I crept to the window, heart thudding in my chest like a rabbit in a trap. I pulled back the curtain expecting wind or a branch or nothing.

But there were no trees near my window.

Only the long black beyond the glass, the moon hanging heavy above the distant woods.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Closer now. From the other side of the glass.

Then, a voice. Calm. Deep. Velvet-soft and serpentine.

“May I come in?”

I should have screamed. But I was lonely, and children will trust anything that speaks softly enough.

I cracked the window.

The night breathed in. I could smell moss and something burnt. I listened. But the voice was gone. So I shut it and backed into bed, heart still thumping.

The window creaked shut on its own.

That night, as I buried myself beneath the blanket, I felt breath on my neck.

“Don’t worry,” he whispered, right behind me. “I’ve got you.”

And I believed him.

Mister Stranger became everything to me. I never saw him then, but I felt him—hovering just behind the veil of sight, like looking at a star that vanishes when stared at. We’d talk. We’d play. He would tell me strange stories about roots that strangle and moons that bleed. I’d laugh, because I thought he was being silly. I was a child.

He taught me games.

We’d draw together. Symbols. Circles. Spirals that made my hand cramp as it spun over and over like it wasn’t mine.

“What is it?” I asked, giggling.

“Home,” he replied.

We covered the walls with the drawings. Pages and pages—odd marks and runes that made no sense to me, but made him hum with approval.

“They’re for your protection,” he said. “From the ones beneath.”

I didn’t ask what that meant.

I just kept drawing.

My parents found the pages.

They tore them down, threw them out with the garbage. Called them nonsense. Called me disturbed.

That night, Mister Stranger didn’t speak.

He had left me. 

And then the dreams came.

They were not dreams. They were burials.

Each night I was dragged—screaming—into the black soil. Hands with too many knuckles clawed at my limbs. I was pulled beneath the roots, into a place that pulsed like a dying heart. I’d wake screaming, soaked in piss and sweat, throat raw and lungs empty.

My parents let me sleep with them after the second night. It didn’t help.

Because even there they could save me in my dream. 

The last night of it all happened when they finally put me back in my room.

Mom tucked me in.

“Why did my friend leave?” I asked her, barely above a whisper.

“I don’t know, baby,” she said, brushing my hair back. “But you’ve got me.”

But her warmth wasn’t the same.

Her love didn’t reach as deep.

I lay in silence.

Then—

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I bolted to the window, heart pounding with joy and terror.

I flung it open.

“Welcome home!” 

They words echoed into the void as the night overtook me.

The forest was alive.

I don’t know how I got there. I remember the window, then darkness, then trees so many trees. Their branches twisted like antlers, blotting out the moon.

My legs bled. My feet were raw. My pajamas shredded by thorns and bramble.

I screamed for help.

No one answered.

Then came the footsteps.

At first, just one set. Then more. Dozens. Hundreds. All around me. Pattering through the underbrush like bare feet on wet tile.

I could hear in unison the gnarled growl of dozens of empty stomachs. 

They weren’t just chasing me.

They were herding me.

I ran. My breath ripped my throat. My lungs burned. I didn’t know where I was going—I just needed out.

I ran as the sharp claws of the forest reached and pulled at my clothing. 

The harsh bramble and thorns cut into my legs and feet. 

I ran, the skittering followed but I never saw my pursuers. 

The air grew colder. The ground steeper. My tears blurred the world.

I broke through the trees and fell—rolling down a hill, branches snapping against my back.

Then-thud.

I hit pavement.

A road.

I tried to scream for help, but only a rasp came out.

Then, in the distance, headlights.

Blinding. Barreling toward me.

I tried to rise. My ankle screamed in protest.

The light roared.

And just before it hit me—

I saw him.

Tall. Wrong. Strings for limbs. A body like a silhouette carved out of darkness. And a face, no face. Just a reflection. A mirror, twisting my own terrified face back at me.

Then nothing.

I woke in my bed.

Covered in mud. Burrs stuck to my skin. My legs bloodied and scratched. Pajamas torn. My feet looked flayed, like I’d been dragging them through glass.

But the room?

Pristine.

No mud. No trail. No open window.

Just me.

Shaking. Breathing. Remembering.

My parents panicked, they couldn’t explain my wounds, and the mess. Especially with the house showing no signs of it. They didn’t believe my story that I just appeared in the woods or especially that Mister Stranger saved me. But there was no explanation.

It was after that day he was gone, or he didn’t show himself to me. The days went by, I started public school, life moved on.

I had nearly forgotten of all of it until that simple question. 

But lately…

The tapping’s back.

Not at the window.

Inside my head.

Soft. Reassuring. Almost like it’s humming.

I keep telling myself I’m fine. That I just haven’t been sleeping well. That nothing is waiting in the dark.

But just now, after writing all this down, I went to splash some water on my face.

I looked up at the mirror.

And in the reflection of my pupil just a glint, just for a second I saw him.

Long limbs. Faceless. Twisting ever so slightly, like a shadow caught mid-dance.

And I don’t know what’s worse…

That he’s back…

Or that he’s always been there.

Watching. Waiting. Smiling with a mouth I’ll never see.

But somehow…

I think everything’s going to be okay.

He’s got me.

1mh9xst,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mh9xst/ex_girlfriend_came_back_then_changed_her_mind/,"Ex girlfriend came back, then changed her mind again","My ex and I were together for two years. We were very much in love and everything went pretty much perfectly until she left for a summer abroad. I’m not much older but I did a lot early, so I had just finished college while she was starting it. As a result, we were living more like adults than college kids. When she spent the time away, she realized that she had been missing out on a bunch of “college stuff” and she broke up with me. It was devastating, and I couldn’t understand why we shouldn’t be able to figure things out.

I never initiated conversation after she got back and moved her stuff out of my apartment. All the same, she found a reason to text me once a month. After 6 months apart, she called me to tell me that she missed me, and asked if we could talk in a month when the semester started. We met for coffee and she said that when she had called me, she wanted to get back together, but now that she had had time to think about it, she had a gut feeling that it wasn’t the right time. Understandably, this was crushing. She talked about how badly she wanted to make things work but how it just didn’t feel right. I was cordial and understanding. After all, I want her to be happy, and I also want to be with someone who wants to be with me. All the same, I was crushed. It would be one thing if she just didn’t want to get back together, but SHE reached out to ME. 

We’re talking again in a few days and I just don’t know what to do. I don’t think she’s vindictive and I don’t believe she’s a bad person. This was a thoughtless thing to do but I don’t know what to think. She doesn’t want to ask me to wait for her but she thinks she’ll be ready eventually. I know my friends hate her for it and think I should cut her off but it doesn’t feel that simple.

It hurts so bad to know that we both want to be together but she just can’t do it for some reason. What can I possibly say to figure this out or untangle things? I don’t want to “convince” someone to date me but I can’t tell if she’s lost or confused or something else. I want to trust her judgment but I can’t understand what she wants or why she can’t make it work.

I know that people’s first reactions will be to assume that she’s a cruel person who is teasing me along for her own purposes. I hope that you can believe me when I say that anything she’s doing, she’s doing without malice.",1,1754303910.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I decided on getting an espresso machine and grinder as a push present 🤰🏻, and I really want to get it right. Looking for an endgame-ish setup, something we won’t outgrow or feel like upgrading anytime soon.

What we’re after:

	•	Mostly milk drinks (flat whites, lattes)
	•	Aesthetics matter: clean, compact, preferably white/neutral wood tones
	•	Easy to maintain
	•	Reliable with good after-sales and servicing (we’re in Singapore)
	•	Something that doesn’t require constant fiddling, but still gives us room to grow
	•	We just did a coffee barista course and are excited to dive into the hobby!
	•	Previously used a Nespresso Vertuo… but it’s kinda depressing after tasting actual specialty coffee and now we can’t go back 😩

(Will be checking all three out in demo showrooms soon)
Should we wait for Fellow ES 1?

Grinders I’m looking at: Timemore Sculptor 064S, Mazzer Philos, Zerno Z1/2 (if I can even ever get one 😅)

Would love to hear thoughts from people with similar priorities or experience with any of the above! Which combo do you think would give us the best bang for our buck and keep us happy long-term?

Even when we tell them no they do it anyway.


Here are some examples:


-Went into the (closed!) kitchen and helped themselves to coffee, a whole box of cereal and 2L milk, leaving the dishes, including coffee machine dirty for us to clean in the morning


-going into the sauna and turned it on themsleves, even after we said sauna is at noon and it was currently 8 am. 
(he sat in the dark because the light switch is locked behind a box. it should have been our job to turn it on. He went into the only one whos buttons are not in said box) 


-flooding the bathroom so much that the room below suffered water damage, where parts of the ceiling fell off 


-stole pockets full of tea bags

1mh9v9o,https://youtu.be/qkWajBjCsp0,4 Very Scary TRUE RV Horror Stories,"# ""The Last Campers at Padre Island"":

I’d been driving my RV along the Gulf Coast for weeks, chasing the freedom of the open road. Late September brought me to a quiet camping spot near Padre Island National Seashore in Texas. The beach stretched out endlessly, waves lapping at the shore, and only a handful of RVs dotted the area. It felt like the perfect place to unwind.

As I parked my RV, a couple from the neighboring rig waved at me. They were in their fifties, with warm smiles that instantly put me at ease.

“Hi there! Quite a view, isn’t it?” the man called out, stepping closer.

“Absolutely,” I said, smiling back. “I’m just passing through, exploring the coast.”

“I’m James, and this is my wife, Michelle,” he said, extending a hand. “We’re from New Hampshire, doing a big cross-country trip for our retirement.”

Michelle nodded enthusiastically. “It’s been a dream of ours. Where are you from?”

“California,” I replied. “Just taking some time to see the country.”

We talked for a while, swapping stories about our travels. They told me about their favorite stops—Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon—and I shared my love for coastal sunsets. Their kindness made the remote spot feel less lonely, and I went to bed that night feeling grateful for friendly neighbors.

The next morning, I was sipping coffee outside when a gray Chevy truck with Utah plates rolled in. A man and a woman climbed out, scanning the area like they were looking for something. The man was tall and lanky, with a scruffy beard and tattoos crawling up his arms. The woman had bleached blonde hair and heavy makeup that seemed out of place against the natural backdrop. They didn’t look like campers, and their presence made my skin prickle.

Later that afternoon, as I read a book under my RV’s awning, the man approached me. His boots crunched on the gravel, and I tensed as he stopped a few feet away.

“Hey, pretty lady,” he said, his voice rough and his smile too wide. “You alone out here?”

I forced a polite smile, my pulse quickening. “Just traveling, but I’m meeting friends soon,” I lied, hoping to sound confident.

He raised an eyebrow, smirking. “Sure you are. Well, if you need anything, just holler.”

His tone felt more like a threat than an offer. As he walked back to his truck, he whispered something to the woman, and they both glanced at me. I decided right then to steer clear of them.

That evening, as I cooked dinner inside my RV, I heard shouting outside. Peeking through the window, I saw the suspicious couple arguing with James and Michelle. Their voices carried over the sound of the waves.

“You can’t just park here without permission!” James said, his face red with frustration.

“This is public land,” the man snapped back. “We do what we want.”

The woman stepped closer to Michelle, her voice low and venomous. “Watch your back.”

My stomach tightened. The argument ended abruptly, with the couple storming off and James and Michelle retreating into their RV, looking shaken. I thought about checking on them but hesitated, not wanting to get involved. I told myself it was probably just a misunderstanding and went to bed, though sleep didn’t come easily.

The next morning, I noticed the gray truck was gone. I let out a relieved breath, thinking they’d left for good. But when I looked at James and Michelle’s RV, their truck was still there, yet there was no sign of them. Usually, they’d be outside by now, sipping coffee or strolling along the beach. The stillness felt wrong.

By afternoon, worry gnawed at me. I walked over to their RV and knocked on the door. “James? Michelle? You okay?”

No answer. I tried the handle, but it was locked. Peering through the window, I saw their belongings neatly arranged—nothing seemed out of place. Maybe they’d gone for a hike, I thought, but doubt lingered. They hadn’t mentioned leaving their RV unattended.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. My mind replayed the argument, the man’s creepy smirk, the woman’s threatening words. Around midnight, I heard footsteps crunching on the gravel outside. My heart raced as I crept to the window and peered out.

In the moonlight, I saw two figures moving around James and Michelle’s RV. It was the man and woman from before—they were back. My breath caught as they pried open the RV’s door with a tool and slipped inside.

I strained to hear their muffled voices.

“Grab the valuables first,” the man said. “Jewelry, cash, anything we can sell.”

“What about them?” the woman asked, her tone icy.

“We’ll bury them later. Let’s move fast.”

Bury them? My blood ran cold. Did they mean James and Michelle? Had they killed them?

I grabbed my phone to call 911, but the screen showed no signal. The reception here was terrible, especially at night. I needed to get help, but the nearest town was miles away, and I didn’t know if I could leave without being seen.

Then, I heard footsteps approaching my RV. My heart pounded as I locked the door and ducked behind the bed, clutching a can of pepper spray I kept in my bag.

A loud knock rattled the door. “Hey, anyone in there?” the man called, his voice sharp.

I held my breath, trembling. He knocked again, harder, then tried the handle. The door shook but held firm. I heard him mutter something to the woman, then his footsteps retreated.

Peeking out, I saw them loading bags into their truck. They were stealing James and Michelle’s belongings. Then, my stomach lurched as they dragged two large bundles wrapped in tarps out of the RV. The shapes were unmistakable—human bodies.

I fought the urge to scream. I had to get out of there, but I couldn’t move until they were gone. After what felt like hours, they hooked James and Michelle’s RV to their truck and drove off into the night.

I waited a few minutes, my hands shaking as I started my RV’s engine. I needed to reach the police. But just as I pulled onto the road, headlights flashed behind me. It was their truck—they were back.

Panic surged through me. Had they seen me? Did they know I’d witnessed everything? I floored the gas, my RV lumbering along the dark, winding road. In the rearview mirror, I saw their truck gaining on me.

The man leaned out the window, shouting something I couldn’t hear over the engine’s roar. Their truck swerved closer, trying to cut me off. I gripped the wheel, my knuckles white, and swerved to avoid them, nearly veering into a ditch.

“Come on, come on,” I whispered, urging my RV to go faster. The road was narrow, flanked by dunes and darkness. If they caught me, I didn’t know what they’d do.

Suddenly, their truck pulled alongside me. The woman’s face was visible in the passenger seat, her eyes locked on mine. The man jerked the wheel, trying to force me off the road. I screamed, yanking my RV back onto the pavement, tires screeching.

Ahead, I saw the faint glow of a gas station. Hope surged through me. I pushed the RV to its limit, the engine groaning. The truck fell back slightly, but they were still too close.

I skidded into the gas station’s lot and stumbled out, running to the payphone. “I need to report a murder!” I gasped to the attendant. “At the beach near Padre Island!”

He stared at me, wide-eyed, and dialed 911. As I explained to the operator, I kept glancing at the road, terrified the truck would appear. But it didn’t.

Police arrived quickly, and I poured out the story—the argument, the break-in, the bodies. They took me back to the campsite, where they found bloodstains in the sand and signs of a struggle where James and Michelle’s RV had been.

Later, I learned the police caught the suspects trying to cross into Mexico with the stolen RV. James and Michelle’s bodies were found buried on the beach, confirming my worst fears.

That night changed me. The open road still calls, but I’m more cautious now, always trusting my instincts. The memory of James and Michelle’s kindness, and the horror that followed, lingers like a shadow, a reminder that danger can hide in even the most beautiful places.





# ""August Silence"":

I’ll never forget that August in 2021. My friends Kylen Schulte and Crystal Turner were out camping again, living their dream in their conversion van, a cozy home on wheels they’d decked out for their adventures. They loved the La Sal Mountains near Moab, Utah—a rugged, beautiful place with red rock cliffs and endless skies. Kylen, tall and radiant with her green eyes, and Crystal, petite and blonde with boundless energy, were newlyweds, married just four months. Their love was the kind you could feel, like a warm glow that made everyone around them smile.

A few days earlier, on August 13, Kylen texted me from their campsite. “There’s this creepy guy camped near us,” she wrote. “He’s been hanging around, staring too much. We’re thinking of moving spots.” I could sense her unease, even through the screen. Crystal chimed in on the group chat, joking but with an edge: “Yeah, this dude’s giving off weird vibes. Might pack up tomorrow.” I told them to stay safe and maybe head back to Moab if it felt off. Kylen replied, “We’ve got this, don’t worry. Just annoying, you know?” I laughed it off with them, but something about it stuck with me.

By August 16, I hadn’t heard from them. That wasn’t unusual—cell service in the mountains was spotty—but they usually checked in every couple of days. Kylen worked at the Moonflower Co-op, and Crystal was at McDonald’s, and they were good about letting friends know their plans. I called Kylen’s phone, but it went straight to voicemail. Same with Crystal’s. I tried not to panic, telling myself they were probably just out of range or their phones had died. But by August 18, the worry was too much. They hadn’t shown up for work, and no one had heard from them. I decided to drive up to their campsite and check on them.

The drive from Moab took about an hour, winding through desert roads with towering cliffs on either side. The beauty of the La Sal Mountains usually took my breath away, but that day, I barely noticed. My hands gripped the steering wheel, my mind racing with what-ifs. What if they were hurt? What if their van had broken down? What if that creepy guy had done something?

I reached the area where they liked to camp, a clearing near a creek off La Sal Loop Road. Their van was there, parked under a scraggly tree, its faded blue paint blending into the landscape. I felt a flicker of relief—maybe they were just inside, sleeping or cooking breakfast. I parked my car and called out, “Kylen! Crystal! You guys here?” My voice bounced off the rocks, but no one answered. The silence was thick, broken only by the faint rustle of leaves.

I walked to the van, my sneakers crunching on the gravel. The side door was slightly open, which wasn’t like them. They were careful, always locking up when they left. I peered inside, and my stomach tightened. The van was a mess—clothes tossed on the floor, a camping stove tipped over, their pet rabbit Ruth’s cage empty. “Guys, where are you?” I muttered, stepping back. Something was wrong. Very wrong.

I scanned the campsite, hoping to see them walking back from a hike. A narrow trail led from the clearing toward the creek, one they often mentioned for its peaceful vibe. I followed it, my heart thudding louder with each step. The sound of water grew as I approached the creek, its gentle flow a stark contrast to the dread building inside me.

Then I saw them.

In the shallow water, partially submerged, were two figures. Kylen’s long frame was unmistakable, her dark hair fanned out in the current. Crystal lay nearby, her blonde hair matted with blood. Both were still, their bodies riddled with gunshot wounds. Blood stained their clothes, pooling in the water around them. I stumbled back, a scream caught in my throat. “No, no, no,” I whispered, tears blurring my vision. This couldn’t be real. Not Kylen and Crystal, who were so full of life, who loved each other so fiercely.

I forced myself to breathe, to think. I needed to call the police, but my phone had no signal. I had to get back to town or find a spot with reception. As I turned to head back to my car, a sound stopped me cold—a sharp snap, like a twig breaking underfoot. It came from the trees behind me. My blood froze. Was someone there? The creepy guy they’d mentioned? The one who did this?

I stood still, listening. The rustling came again, closer this time, deliberate. Footsteps. My mind screamed to run, but my legs felt like lead. I scanned the trees, expecting to see a figure emerge, a gun in hand. “Who’s there?” I called, my voice shaking. No answer, just the crunch of leaves. I backed away slowly, my eyes darting between the trail and the woods.

Then, a figure stepped out—a park ranger, his uniform dusty, his face etched with concern. “Ma’am, are you okay?” he asked, his hand on his radio.

I nearly collapsed with relief. “No, I’m not,” I said, my voice breaking. “My friends—they’re dead. Over there, by the creek.”

His eyes widened, and he grabbed his radio. “This is Ranger Thompson, I’ve got a possible homicide at South Mesa, La Sal Loop Road. Need immediate backup and EMS.” He turned to me. “Stay here, don’t touch anything. Help’s on the way.”

But I couldn’t stay. The image of Kylen and Crystal’s bodies burned in my mind, and the thought that their killer might still be out there made my skin crawl. I stumbled back to my car, locking the doors as soon as I was inside. I sat there, shaking, trying to process what I’d seen. My friends, gone. Murdered.

I drove until I found a spot with cell service and called 911, my voice trembling as I explained what I’d found. The operator was calm, professional, but it did little to ease the horror. “Stay where you are,” she said. “Officers are on their way.”

Hours later, the campsite was a hive of activity—police, sheriffs, crime scene investigators. I gave my statement, recounting the texts about the creepy guy, the silence, the discovery. They asked if I’d seen anyone else, if I’d noticed anything unusual. I told them about the footsteps, the rustling, but admitted it was probably just the ranger. Or was it? The uncertainty gnawed at me.

In the weeks that followed, the investigation unfolded. The Grand County Sheriff’s Office identified a suspect, Adam Pinkusiewicz, who had worked with Crystal at McDonald’s. He’d been in the area when Kylen and Crystal were killed, and after fleeing Utah, he confessed to the murders before taking his own life. The details he shared matched what only the killer would know, and in December 2022, the case was closed.

But closure didn’t erase the trauma. Every night, I saw their bodies in that creek, their lifeless forms etched into my memory. The sound of those footsteps haunted me, even if it was just the ranger. What if it wasn’t? What if someone else was out there, watching? I stopped going to the mountains, once a place of joy and freedom. Now, they held only fear and loss.

Kylen and Crystal’s love was a light in the world, and it was snuffed out in a moment of senseless violence. I think of them often—their laughter, their adventures, their unbreakable bond. And I wonder, if they’d moved their campsite that day, would they still be here? I’ll never know. All I can do is hold onto their memory and pray they’ve found peace.





# ""The Night Big Blue Broke Loose"":

Sean and I had been planning this weekend for months, eager to escape the city and visit our friends’ house nestled in the mountains. Our RV, a 30-foot beast we called ""Big Blue,"" was our ticket to freedom, packed with cozy blankets, camping gear, and enough snacks to last a week. We were ready for trails, laughter, and a break from routine.

We pulled into our friends’ driveway just as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple. The driveway was narrow and sloped steeply down toward the street, flanked by tall pines and a scattering of gravel. We parked Big Blue close to the house, figuring it was secure enough for the night. We hauled out our bags, greeted our friends with hugs, and settled in for a warm dinner filled with chatter and wine.

After dinner, our friend Tom mentioned he needed to squeeze his car into the driveway. “No big deal,” Sean said, wiping his hands on a napkin. “I’ll just move the RV a bit further down.”

A knot formed in my chest. “Are you sure?” I asked, glancing out the window at the steep incline. “That driveway’s no joke.”

Sean chuckled, brushing off my worry. “It’s fine. I’ll just back it up a few feet. Won’t take a minute.”

I followed him outside, my unease growing as he climbed into Big Blue’s driver’s seat. The RV’s engine roared to life, a low rumble that echoed through the quiet evening. Sean shifted into reverse, and for a moment, everything seemed normal. The headlights cut through the dusk, illuminating the gravel path. But then, as he eased off the brake, the RV didn’t stop. It kept rolling backward, slowly at first, then faster.

“Sean!” I shouted, my voice sharp with panic. “Hit the brake!”

He fumbled with the controls, his face pale in the dashboard’s glow. “It’s not stopping!” he yelled back, slamming his foot on the pedal. But Big Blue kept moving, picking up speed as it slid down the driveway. Sean threw open the door and leapt out, hitting the gravel hard and rolling to a stop with a groan.

I stood frozen, watching in horror as the RV barreled down the slope. Its tires crunched over the gravel, the sound growing louder and more frantic, like a beast breaking free. The headlights swung wildly, casting eerie beams across the trees. I could hear the engine still running, a guttural growl that made my skin crawl.

Tom and his wife, Lisa, burst out of the house, drawn by my screams. “What’s going on?” Lisa cried, her eyes wide.

“The RV’s loose!” I shouted, pointing as Big Blue vanished around a curve in the driveway. “It’s not stopping!”

We sprinted after it, our footsteps pounding in a desperate rhythm. My mind raced with worst-case scenarios: What if it hit the street? What if it crashed into a car or, worse, a person? The thought made my throat tighten.

As we rounded the bend, a sickening crash shattered the air—a deafening crunch of metal against wood. Big Blue had slammed into a massive oak tree at the bottom of the driveway. The front of the RV was crumpled like a tin can, wrapped around the trunk. Glass from the windshield littered the ground, glinting in the fading light. The side panels were dented, and one of the headlights flickered weakly before going out.

For a moment, no one spoke. The only sounds were the hiss of the engine and the distant chirping of crickets. Sean staggered to his feet, clutching his scraped elbow. “Is everyone okay?” he asked, his voice shaky.

Tom nodded, his face ashen. “Yeah, but… look at that thing.”

I stared at the wreckage, my hands trembling. Big Blue, our home on wheels, was a mangled mess. The front bumper was twisted, the hood buckled, and the interior was a jumble of shattered dishes and scattered gear. It was a miracle no one had been inside—or in its path.

“What happened?” Lisa asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Sean shook his head, running a hand through his hair. “I don’t know. I thought the brakes would hold. I didn’t think…”

“You didn’t use the wheel chocks, did you?” I said, the realization hitting me like a punch. We’d been in such a rush to settle in that we’d skipped that crucial step.

Sean’s face fell. “No. I didn’t. I thought it’d be fine for a quick move.”

The weight of that mistake settled over us. A simple oversight had turned our weekend getaway into a nightmare. We stood there, staring at the wreckage, as the reality sank in: we’d come terrifyingly close to disaster. If the RV had veered into the street, if it had hit a car or a neighbor’s house, the outcome could have been catastrophic.

The next few days were a blur of phone calls to insurance, arranging a tow truck, and finding a place to stay while Big Blue was hauled to a repair shop. The damage was extensive—thousands of dollars in repairs, months before we’d see our RV again. But the real cost was emotional. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Big Blue hurtling down that hill, unstoppable, a 30-foot monster we couldn’t control. I heard the crunch of metal, felt the helpless panic of those moments.

That night taught us a lesson we’d never forget: never underestimate the power of an RV, and never skip the safety checks, no matter how small they seem.",1,1754303662.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

The last 4 weeks I have been following the no food contact plastic (NFCP) diet, as described in r/PlasticObesity. 

Https://www.reddit.com/r/PlasticObesity/comments/1ltqer6/a_low_food_contact_plastic_diet_lfcp_protocol/

Starting weight - 93.4kg (prior week low)

WK1: At-lib av. calories - 1,558 Kcal; Energy 2/5; Av steps - 4,172, other exercise - some gardening work;  Lowest weight - not recorded as away from home.

End weight - 91.8kg 

Total weight loss - 1.6 kg

Av protein 67g / 16%
Av carbs 210g / 50%
Av fat 63g / 34%


*Notes:*

- This is at-lib, no protein restriction, swamp - and weight was lost nonetheless!

- Energy / activity - energy relatively low, with 8-9hrs+ sleep and not much desire to do much, except in wk3. Tired after 10k steps. Less energy than when doing Kempner & eating 1,000kcal / day which is odd. I do think this is connected with the food I am eating and is something I'd like to monitor.

- Cravings - cheese & honey (not together!) Cheese &  contamination seems to be a mixed bag. From end of wk 2 onwards, I have tried a bunch of artisanal cheeses from local cheese shop and M&S - 30g of gouda made me very hungry, eating over 2000kcal one day, so did not have it again. 100-150g camembert, 50-60g gruyere & parmesan seem to have no effect, so stuck with them. Honey straight from honeycomb frame also fine (though honeycomb frame came in a plastic case) - 60-80g at once. 

- Cheating [i.e. eating potentially contaminated food produced by industry, on purpose, outside or above limits in the diet protocol] - currently runnning at about 3x per week. Cheats include: lots of patisserie bought fondant candy (1,900kcal for the day), entire 250g block of camembert a couple of times (1,600kcal for the day), small choux pastry (1,500kcal for the day), [gouda cheese, starting a day of elevated hunger] & pistachio cake (2,000kcal for the day), 1/2 danish pastry (2,150kcal for the day), organic wine - under 250ml / beer - 1/2 pint (under 1,400kcal for the day). 

- Eating out (additional to cheating) - there is no real control over how food is handled - but sensible guesses & choices can be made.  My go-tos are: 

> cook-your own (plain) food places like Chinese hotpot / Korean bbq; 

> plain meat + new or roast potato (not from bag!) + veg - like a good sunday roast in pubs;

> plain or broth-cooked rice & meat dishes in Indian / Middle Eastern cooking - biryani / pilaf

> generally staying away from sauces, dressings,  bread, marinades, salads, deserts or 'processed food' (pies, dumplings, sausages, pasta, etc.) that could have been bought in rather than made in restaurant.

- Intentional food testing - 10ml vinegar one morning resulted in 2,859kcal for the day (wk3) and 200g soured cream resulted in 2,700 binge on day 1 & 1,800 kcal the day after (wk4). I do not miss this level of constant hunger! All of this may be slowing progress as little weight loss in weeks 3 & 4 (1/3 of weight loss in weeks 1 & 2 without a serious increase in calories)


- But is it not just a calorie restricted diet? On the face of it YES, it looks like it, but I am NOT restricting calories. Believe it or not, this is how much I want to eat and what I want to eat, no willpower needed. And it's easy! Also, if it were just calories in and out, should have lost a bit more weight in wk3-4! 



*How does this compare to potato diet?*

SMTM's Potato diet, which I consider the gold standard of low contamination diets, resulted in an average weight loss of 10.6lbs (4.8kg) over 4 weeks vs this experiment 1.6 kg, a third. My previous rice+ fruit experiment (which should be very close to potato diet contamination wise) resulted in 1.1kg loss per week (assuming 4.4kg over same period). This tells me current diet is probably not that low-contamination as I'd like it to be. 


*What's next?*

My goal is potato diet results, with at-lib, non contaminated food & excellent energy levels. This is falling a bit short and the problems are obvious:

- Testing potentially contaminated foods & them turning out to be contaminated is not compatible with solid weight loss - so will need to stop that for now. 

- Cheese - I doubt it (or any dairy, really) is free of contamination - does it have more of an impact on energy rather than appetite, as long as not having high fat diary (cream / butter)? After eating blocks off cheese on repeat I must say it is losing its appeal, so won't mind cutting it off all together next month. 

- Eating out & drinking & deliberate cheating - Impact has been relatively low - so carry on with current 'whatever suits the social calendar' levels, but look into reducing it if fixing first two points does not do the trick.

Naturally, my phone took a dramatic dive...comedy gold, right? 😆 But here's the cute part: as it slipped, this charming guy, only an aisle away, dashed over to caatch it just before it hit the ground. I mean, talk about pergect timing!

We both burst out laughing, and he grinned, handing it back with a smooth ""Looks like I saved the day."" To which, I laughed and replied, ""My hero!"" 🙌

Turns out, he's as clumsy as I am, having done the dance of a thousand dropped iyems himself. We swapped funny stories aout embarrassing spills and agreed it's all part of our charm, really. 😊 Such a sweet, unnexpected moment that turned a regular grocery run into a delightful little highliight of my day.
