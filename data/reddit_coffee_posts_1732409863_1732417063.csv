1gyh33v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gyh33v/holidays_with_family_is_miserable/,Holidays with family is miserable,"Every holiday is so stressful for me.  My (41F) anxiety is through the roof every time.  My mom and sister just make it absolutely miserable for me.  My sister shows up late with Starbucks coffee in hand and sits and texts with someone while she is ""helping"" me cook, so it appears like she would rather be other people. She usually starts a fight with someone so she can storm off and leave right after we eat dinner and she takes a bunch of leftovers with her.  My mom has a separate property that is about 30 minutes from her house and about 45 minutes from my house.  She has 2 horses and a bunch of farm cats that she feeds.  She never rushes to feed all of them on Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Easter when I end up hosting Thanksgiving dinner.  My husband (43M) ends up watching the boys (well, sort of.  I end up having to yell for him to go look for them.) and I end up doing all the cooking by myself until my sister finally arrives.  I usually end up making a 30 lb turkey, 10 lbs of mashed potatoes from scratch, 5 boxes of stuffing (Stove Top now to save my sanity a little bit), croissants that roll up and bake yourself, and 2 pans of green bean casserole. Furthermore, my mom expects me to cook food for 40-50 people, so we have leftovers for days for us and her and my sister. There's usually less than 10 people that come.  My in laws come sometimes. My mom will pitch in on buying stuff but she won't pitch in to help on anything until the very end and then she acts like I'm a psychopath when she finally does show up hours later . She usually shows up about time for us to start serving lunch. My sister is the exact same way. She'll tell me she'll get there early and help me with the cooking but then she doesn't show up until 10:00 - 12:00pm.  We usually eat lunch at noon or so. The last few years I've been a witch and told them I'm not starting cooking anything until they get here. Then they get upset because they want to look at the Black Friday ads and go Black Friday shopping that night.  My mom has tons of stuff in her kitchen (think hoarder) so there would be no way to do it at her house.  Table is covered with crap and counters are covered too. There is literally no room to cook or to eat dinner. It is plenty big enough but she just has too much stuff everywhere.  My sister also lives with my mom so she can't host.  I end up beating myself up because I think to myself how many more holidays will I have left with my mom. She's 66 years old.  My sister is 33 years old.  I just hate the holidays.  I have a special needs child who is autistic and kinda verbal but still requires a lot of help. He is 9 years old and not potty trained.  We also have a 6 year old too.  My mom always insists upon having my husband go with her to the farm to help with the animals. She goes every other damn day by herself but on the holiday she expects someone to help her. What would you do?  I would love some advice.  ",1,1732416926.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False
1gyh2oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1gyh2oi/i_have_such_a_hard_time_making_friends_that_i/,I have such a hard time making friends that I allowed the one friend I managed to keep to harshly put me down ,"(Yes I posted this in the mental health subreddit but realized it may be better for this subreddit)

I‚Äôm an early twenties female. I‚Äôve struggled with my mental health from a very young age, a lot of it stems from bullying and unhealthy family dynamic. 

I‚Äôve always had a hard time making friends since I have anxiety and am a little on the spectrum. 

A few years ago, I became friends with this girl online and we started chatting regularly since we couldn‚Äôt meet up all the time due to us living 2+ hours away and me being busy with college.

She could be really nice to me when I showed her my art and told her how school was going. I even used to confide to her about how hard it is for having to live at home with my emotionally immature and controlling parents

I started noticing problems whenever I would post anything on my social media, she would text me right after seeing it and tell me things she found wrong with what I posted. I‚Äôve told her I have no interest in becoming an influencer like she does, and I know college isn‚Äôt always for everyone, but she‚Äôs always telling me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you want to get so good at social media that you won‚Äôt even need school anymore?‚Äù I‚Äôm pretty low key on social media like I‚Äôll post a picture of my coffee even if the background is just the coffee shop parking lot, but she keeps telling me not to post anything unless I run it by her. 

Things started really bothering me when I would reach out to her to seek support about stress from college or my home life, and she starting telling me that she can‚Äôt entertain any negativity at all because it doesn‚Äôt align with her goals of making it big as an influencer. She told me that me choosing to get a degree in order to later build a career is a much smaller destiny than hers. When I expressed frustration about my mother refusing to communicate with me, my friend said I should acknowledge that I‚Äôm the problem for being upset and childish all the time and nobody wants to put up with that 


Yes, I do have depression and anxiety that affects my mood and outlook, but I still found her comments to be really hurtful. At the same time, I‚Äôm aware that I have difficulty making friends so maybe her harshness is just something I‚Äôll have to deal with if I want to keep a friend around. It‚Äôs not like I can probably do any better, believe me I‚Äôve tried. Yeah I see other young people who have friends they enjoy spending time with or seek support from, but maybe I‚Äôm just incapable of finding that. I remember around last week I was so close to just breaking down and crying and when I texted my friend that I was in a bad place needing someone to talk to she just sent me a screenshot of her notifications saying she had more important things to look at. 


Everyone says to reach out to others for help, but when I do I‚Äôm pushed away and told I‚Äôm the problem. Yeah I see other young people who have good friends they enjoy spending time with or seek support from, but maybe I‚Äôm just incapable of finding that and should take what I can get

I remember being maybe 10 and wondering why I looked different than everyone else. I wondered why my siblings looked different than me. I wondered why my mom would call me names. I didn't want to be like that. Everyone wants to be normal, accepted. Sometimes I felt not worthy of love.

I remember desperately trying to figure out how to lose weight. Commercials about weight loss and health class were my entire understanding of our bodies and weight. It consumed me.

It wasn't until I was 12 that I learned that it doesn't only matter what you eat, but how much.

I remember staying at my dads house for the weekend and challenging myself to only drink juice. I did it. I felt awful. Yet, there's a special kind of accomplishment you get from deprivation. You feel better than those around you, like your mind is stronger. I got  back to my moms and felt dizzy. My first hunger pains. I ate a bagel and felt as though I walked 100 steps in the wrong direction. That everything I wanted for myself was unattainable. 

It wasn't until a year later that I first purged. I had spent a year obsessing about weight loss and working out. Progress wasn't easily made back then. I would break so easily and binge.

It's odd how parents seem to pass their eating disorders to their children. I've always felt judged by my mom. She is prideful.

Fast forward to 15. I had joined some programs at school in which I made friends who loved fitness and health. I started going to the gym every day. I think I weighed about 180 pounds back then. I'm 5' 9"". I would take photos of myself and just tear myself to shreds.

I found some forums that detailed how to lose weight. CICO. I got serious. I would wake up at 4 or so to run. I would fast for as long as I physically could. Lots of black coffee and youtube eating challenges.

I think I dropped down to about 130 lbs by the time I was 16. People noticed. Girls noticed. I loved the attention. This is what I had always wanted. But after so much time spent obsessing over my your image, you can always find something you don't like about yourself.

My weight changed with the times, I would swing between about 170 and 130 lbs over the next few years. Lots of binging, lots of deprivation.

Im not sure what I hope to accomplish with this post. I've always wanted to just start posting whatever was on my mind. Now I guess I can do that.

I'm 22 now, I've been in therapy for my relationship with food over the years. Every time I feel like I'm getting better something happens in my life that makes me slip back into old habits.

I've gone through a breakup recently. I let it consume me. I'm back in hell.

Why do I do this to myself

Control I guess.

I think I'm usually a better writer than this but I just woke up after drinking all night. I puked 5 or 6 times last night.

Maybe I'm just spiraling.

My friend invited me over to play some guitar. I'm gonna do that now. I regret this post already. I'm going to need to rewrite it when I'm in my mind.",1,1732416395.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

**When:** August 23‚Äì27, 2024  
**Who/Why:** My friend and I attending a mutual friend‚Äôs wedding (not at Four Seasons)  
**Room Type:** Golden Oak View Room  
**Booking Method:** FSPP (I've used Nick at Live Luxe Travel Co.)

[Four Seasons Orlando at Walt Disney World](https://preview.redd.it/up07v28mhr2e1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8d10e91a18df34746a65263a1efb74188e1a870)

**Service: 10/10**

The service at this property was impeccable from start to finish. Months before our stay, the concierge team was extremely helpful in planning and accommodating our needs. Despite the large size of the property (443 rooms), I always felt welcomed back by staff members, which added a personalized touch to our experience. Special shoutout to the housekeeping team! I scheduled housekeeping and turn-down services through the app, timing them during breakfast and dinner on our non-park days. They consistently completed the service without fail, even with 443 rooms!) I also appreciated the thoughtful postcards left at turn-down. The poolside service was outstanding‚Äîattentive and accommodating without being intrusive.

**Property: 10/10**

The property is stunning and located within the beautiful Golden Oak community. The landscaping is meticulously maintained; throughout the day, staff could be seen trimming bushes, planting flowers, and keeping everything spotless.

The pools, including the lazy river, was a big highlight. The spa is expansive, featuring an outdoor hot tub and a spacious co-ed relaxation room. While we didn‚Äôt use the dedicated kid and teen areas, they looked impressive and well thought-out for families.

[Lazy River](https://preview.redd.it/upwbh9d5hr2e1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49bca7471e883140969fed57b3654723eec269a1)

**Room: 10/10**

Our Golden Oak View Room was spectacular. We used the pull-out bed, which the housekeeping team set up every night. The room was spacious and comfortable, with the added bonus of no minibar‚Äîno overpriced snacks and drinks cluttering the space (they were instead located elsewhere at each restaurant lol)!¬† Our view included the Golden Oak residences, the parking lot, and some nearby construction. While not ideal, it didn‚Äôt bother us since we were only in the room during mornings and evenings. We also had a construction view credit, which was more than made up! If I had to nitpick, the barn-style bathroom door isn‚Äôt my favorite. It‚Äôs trendy, but for a family-oriented property, a door with more privacy would be better.

**Food: 9/10**

The food across the property was fantastic, with Capa standing out as my favorite dining experience. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of the options we tried:

* **Capa:** The signature rooftop restaurant. The dessert was especially memorable‚Äîabsolutely delicious! I don't remember what it was, but picture below (lol).
* **Ravello:** Offers a breakfast buffet or √† la carte options in the morning and serves Italian cuisine in the evening. Both were great. This is also where they have the Goofy breakfast once or twice a week.
* **Lickety Split:** A coffee and ice cream (gelato?) shop. The macarons are a must-try!
* **PB&G:** Perfect for lunch. My friend loved the fish tacos, and I enjoyed the popcorn shrimp (a starter that easily works as a meal).
* **Plancha:** Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt get a chance to try this one.

**Overall Experience**

This was a spectacular stay. As someone who has always stayed at Disney-owned properties, I was initially hesitant about the lack of constant on-site park transportation. However, the motorcoach service was reliable and convenient, with regular stops at all four parks. I‚Äôd return to the Four Seasons Orlando in a heartbeat‚Äîeven for a trip focused entirely on the parks.

**Tips**

**1. Plan for park transportation:** The motorcoach service works well, but if you're rope-dropping a park, consider using Uber/Lyft for more control over your timing. Just factor in a little extra time for drivers to navigate the entrance process.

**2. Maximize breakfast credits:** If you have leftover breakfast credits or want a quick bite before heading to the parks, stop by Lickety Split (opens at 6:30 a.m.) for grab-and-go items. These can be stored in your room fridge for later.

**3. Book with a Four Seasons Preferred Partner:** I've used Nick at Live Luxe Travel and him and his team are spectacular!

-------------------------------------------------------------------

When living in a small space, maximizing your surroundings is essential. A wall away loveseat recliner is an excellent choice for compact living areas, offering comfort, versatility, and style without overcrowding your room. This type of loveseat recliner is designed to fit snugly against the wall while providing ample seating and relaxation options. Here are some notable benefits of incorporating a wall away loveseat recliner in your small space.

### Space Efficiency

One of the most significant advantages of a wall away loveseat recliner is its space-saving design. Traditional recliners often require extra space for full reclining. The wall away model is specifically designed to be positioned close to the wall, making it ideal for smaller apartments or rooms. You can enjoy a comfortable seating arrangement without worrying about obstructing pathways or squeezing around furniture.

### Versatile Functionality

This style of recliner is not just a mere seating option; it also showcases multifunctionality. Many wall away loveseat recliners come with built-in storage solutions, such as hidden compartments or cup holders. This feature allows you to stow away essentials while keeping everything easily accessible. Whether you want to use it as a cozy reading nook or a place to unwind after a long day, its adaptability suits various activities.

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/wall-away-loveseat-recliner  
  
### Enhanced Comfort

Even in small spaces, comfort should never be compromised. A wall away loveseat recliner typically features cushioned seats, ergonomic support, and adjustable reclining positions. You can easily find a loveseat that meets your preferences for lumbar support and cushion firmness. After a busy day, sinking into a recliner that hugs your body can significantly enhance your relaxation experience.

### Stylish Design Options

There's no need to sacrifice style for space when choosing a wall away loveseat recliner. These recliners come in various materials, colors, and designs, allowing you to find the perfect match for your decor. Whether you prefer a contemporary leather look or a cozy fabric finish, you can easily integrate it with your interior design. A stylish loveseat not only serves a functional purpose but also acts as a statement piece in your room.

### Selecting the Right Fabric and Color

Choosing the right fabric and color for your wall away loveseat recliner can significantly affect your space. Here are some suggestions:

- **Color Coordination:** Decide on a color palette that complements your living room decor. Neutral colors like gray, beige, or taupe can create a serene atmosphere.

Lighting plays a crucial role in highlighting your wall away loveseat recliner:

If you‚Äôre looking for a bond that‚Äôs as wholesome as it is exciting, we might just be a great match!

Oh, and I‚Äôm clean, ddf, and experienced, so you can feel at ease.

What I love most is learning about other cultures, hobbies, and perspectives; meeting new people always fascinates me.

The sore throat and the mouth sores‚Ä¶I thought it would never end, and it hasn‚Äôt yet. This has been my experience with it as a working EBF mom:

(I will also state I also have a sinus infection with this, and had congestion the whole week before I realized I had HFM)

Day 1 - I had an ungodly headache in the middle of the night. Woke up drenched in sweat. No temp. Went back to sleep after taking some Tylenol. 

Day 2 - Got up and went to work. I was ungodly tired, but I always am (my baby doesn‚Äôt like to sleep through the night and that‚Äôs ok). Got home and ate dinner. Developed a fever of 100. Took Tylenol and a shower. Went to bed. Woke up drenched again. More Tylenol. Back to sleep. I thought it was from my sinus infection. 

Day 3 - Woke up on my own super early. Drank coffee. Got a little energy. Took baby on a walk. Fever came back. Knocked me out. Got home. Napped for 2 hours. (I never nap). Took covid test. Negative. Ate. Fever came back at 99. More Tylenol. Back to sleep. 

Day 4 - wake up and throat is killing me. Popped cough drops all day. Still think it‚Äôs from sinus infection drainage. I mostly lived life as normally as possible just with a throat that is on fire. Bed time I remember telling my husband ‚Äúmy mouth is on fire‚Äù sleep. No fever. No chills. Body aches start. My tongue got like ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know another way to explain it. 

Day 5 - Woke up and went to work. Wore a mask just in case. Went to little clinic during break. God antibiotic for sinus infection. I kept telling the doctor ‚Äúmy throat hurts so bad that my mouth is on fire.‚Äù Strep test negative. He tells me not to go to work for a day and try to sleep the next day. I got home and nap. We take baby to doctor for checkup. We leave there and my hands start breaking out. By the time we get home my feet feel like needles are stabbing my feet. The pain between the toes was rough. 

Day 6 -  I wake up with what feels like lie bumps all over my tongue. I‚Äôm texting friends saying this isn‚Äôt just a sinus infection. What if this is HFM. So I go back to Little Clinic and she diagnosed me With HFM. No more fever. Throat is burning. She gives me some lidocaine mouth wash and tells me good luck. 

Days 7-9 - mouth is on fire. Ulcers everywhere. Roof of mouth has red sores all over. Each day more pop up. They were all over my tongue, gums, roof of mouth, inside my lips, and the back of my throat. I had probably 15 under my tongue. Like I said MISERABLE. Throat is still on fire. I can hardly eat. Cold soup and apple sauce became that only thing I could get down. 

Day 10 - no more sore throat. Mouth pain is still horrible. More sores. Every now and then I get a sharp pain in the side of my throat. Ice water is saving me. 

Day 11 - woke up with new sores in my mouth. Tongue is so swollen from all the sores. It‚Äôs miserable to eat, but I force myself bc I‚Äôm still EBF my baby and have to make sure he is getting what he needs. Water. Water. Water. Mouth rinse helps in very short bursts. I usually save it for when the pain gets excruciating. No more rash on hands. 

Day 12 (today) - spitting blood from the mouth sores when I brush my teeth. About the same as yesterday. I‚Äôm not at tired today as I have been for almost 3 weeks now. Mouth feels swollen from everything. Salt water rinse burns like the devil but I push through. Tongue feels fuzzy again. Lips are burning. Not sure if it‚Äôs bc they are chapped or if they are about to break out in sores. Stay tuned. Mouth is still really swollen. I keep praying I wake up tomorrow able to eat normally. 


How‚Äôd I get it? It had to be from my baby. I don‚Äôt think I realized. He got a mild fever and diarrhea about a week before my day 1. He got a diaper rash the next day. He‚Äôs also cutting 4 teeth, so I assumed it was all related to teething. Hindsight. I bet it was HFM. 


I wanted to share my experience for those who may be 7 days in with no end in sight. Progress is progress. The mouth was the worst part for me!  I don‚Äôt think my supply has been affected by HFM other than I‚Äôm just not drinking as much water. I have steroids I could take, but with me EBF I don‚Äôt want to risk it. I‚Äôd rather power through than risk it. ",4,1732414908.0,beyondthebump,0,1.0,False

On March 3rd, 1868, Mrs. Temperance Wood twisted her bedsheet into a rope, tied a noose, threw it over a rafter of her 5th Avenue manor, climbed atop her mother‚Äôs favorite chair and stepped off.¬† Her cold body was found hours later - found, unfortunately, by Miss Alice Newberry, Temperance‚Äôs twenty-year-old cousin, recently arrived in Manhattan from London and residing within the household. ¬†

Temperance‚Äôs husband, Dr. Clarence Woods, was overcome by grief.¬† A devout Methodist and son of a minister, Dr. Woods publicly expressed disbelief his beloved could have despaired so.¬† To those close to him, however, he revealed his wife had been experiencing frightful delusions in the weeks preceding her death.¬† Mrs. Woods - previously a great lover of animals - developed a strange phobia of dogs, crossing the street or fleeing whenever she happened upon a canine.¬† Then, she began seeing black dogs in the shadows, gnashing their teeth and growling menacingly.

The extent of Temperance Woods‚Äô madness became achingly clear upon discovery of her diary.¬† Pages had been torn out, seemingly at random, but her last entry - penned by an unsteady, trembling hand - was a nightmare-scape worthy of the Book of Revelations.¬† The black dogs followed her everywhere, she wrote.¬† The black dogs were blasphemous things: they stood on two legs, like men.¬† Goat-like horns erupted above their flopping ears.¬† Their eyes glowed like the fires of the Adversary. ¬†

Her last written words, nearly illegible, struck fear in the hearts of the New York police investigators.

*I shall return as a spook to haunt the deformed hag Kate McCleester, who pushes her cart down Mulberry Street.¬† For it is her witchery that so doomed me to my fate!*

Her room was searched, and one of Kate McCleester‚Äôs misshapen jars of cold cream was found amongst Mrs. Woods‚Äô belongings.¬† The opaque cream had an odd, pea-colored tinge to it.¬† Dr. Woods, grief once again inflamed, went on a war path.¬†

Sadly for the doctor, his fiery accusations came to naught.¬† A platoon of coppers found Kate McCleester - an impoverished cripple of the notorious Five Points slum - and confiscated her cart, on the (accurate) grounds her wares were stolen property. Her misshapen jars of cold cream were tested in every way conceivable, and no poison was detected.¬† Dr. Woods claimed his late wife‚Äôs bowels, upon autopsy, had been riddled with an odd green sediment.¬† But Dr. Aaron Cogg, the physician who‚Äôd performed the procedure, refuted this account.¬† He stated Mrs. Woods‚Äô organs were largely normal for a woman her age. ¬†

He also noted that Mrs. Woods had been pregnant.

\*\*\*\*\*

A perusal of the limited records available suggests James McCleester arrived in Manhattan around 1845.¬† Roughly two years later, in 1847, Mr. McCleester‚Äôs family arrived to join him.¬† They are reported as: Ann McCleester, aged 35.¬† Katherine McCleester, aged 12.¬† Kendra McCleester, aged 10.¬† Michael McCleester, aged 8.¬† William McCleester, aged 6.¬† Arthur McCleester, aged 4.¬† The family hailed from County Kerry, Ireland. ¬†

Ann‚Äôs sister, Molly O'Doul, had been something of a healer in their hamlet.¬† She‚Äôd fixed broken bones and cared for the infirm - but also assisted young girls desperate to make a pregnancy go away quietly.¬† As well as married women with a desire for the same of their drunken brute husbands.¬† She‚Äôd cultivated a reputation for witchcraft amongst the pious town gossips - perhaps even necromancy; communion with those fiends hidden beyond the veil. ¬†

James McCleester, a skilled carpenter, found some success in New York.¬† After summoning his family to the New World, he provided them a life that made them the envy of their fellow Kerry brethren.¬† The McCleester clan lived in an apartment amongst the Germans on Rivington Street.¬† The boys attended grammar school, while Kate and Kendra became pupils of the Miss Julie Clay Academy for Foreign Born Girls, a small institution in the Eleventh Ward that purported to provide an English-style finishing school education at a bargain rate.¬†

The family lived happily until 1850.¬† That year, rough scaffolding collapsed beneath James McCleester‚Äôs feet.¬† His head split open on the hard dirt.¬†

After James‚Äôs death, his widow and children were plunged into the harsh existence intimately familiar amongst their countrymen.¬† No longer able to afford their apartment, the family relocated to a room on the third floor of a wooden tenement building on Mulberry Street, in the middle of the infamous Sixth Ward.¬† Kate found work as a seamstress; Michael and Willy, as newsboys and street-sweepers.¬† In 1852, Arthur joined his brothers‚Äô operation and Ann followed her daughter to the workshop.

Kendra, however, continued her schooling at the Miss Julie Clay Academy.¬† The McCleesters frequently fell asleep with empty bellies, but Kendra never missed a tuition payment.¬† This aberration can be understood under one overriding condition: Kendra McCleester was beautiful.

Kendra wasn‚Äôt the comeliest girl in her small country hamlet.¬† She wasn‚Äôt the most delectable creature trawling a Tenderloin District dance hall.¬† No.¬† Kendra possessed a beauty that rivaled the sculptures of ancient Greece; the marvels of the Renaissance masters.¬† Her form was nymphlike and willowy; her hair, a shining river of golden curls.¬† Her green eyes sparkled like emeralds over high cheekbones, a delicate patrician nose, and plump lips the color of cherries.¬† A beauty so singular and radiant, she would have her choice of suitors - suitors who could pluck her from her life of poverty, her family clinging to her ankle. ¬†

Ann McCleester, a woman with an eye for investment, refused to risk her daughter‚Äôs pale skin to the wrath of the beating summer sun, or her slender fingers to the maw of a Singer sewing machine. ¬†

Kendra did contribute to the family's finances in her own way.¬† On warm nights, she and Kate took to the crowded streets of Five Points, buckets of hot corn under their arms.¬† Kendra - possessed of a voice rivaled only in beauty by her cotton-clad form - sang Irish hymns to lure customers.¬† It was said Kendra could quell an alehouse brawl, tame the meanest of the Sixth Ward bullies, and stop a riot in its tracks with her angelic voice. ¬†

Kate, aware of the danger faced by a woman alone, took to dressing as a man and posing as Kendra‚Äôs brother. She was extremely convincing, former student she was of Rebekah Kleiner - the notorious fence, confidence woman, and mistress of disguise, whose Germantown dry goods store was then a bastion of the underworld.¬† Mrs. Kleiner had also taught Kate the art of pickpocketing.¬† As Kendra hypnotized the bruisers and gamblers with her siren song, Kate slipped soundlessly through the crowd, relieving the men of their ill-guarded belongings. ¬†

Tales of the beautiful Hot Corn Girl traveled beyond the filthy, diseased streets of the immigrant neighborhoods to the mansions of Fifth Avenue, where they found a certain Lewis Van Wooten, son of Jakob Van Wooten, the materials and real estate magnate whose family owned half of Brooklyn.¬† Lewis fancied himself as an amateur anthropologist, and embarked on occasional - proctored and guarded - trips to the Lower Wards, where he observed the habits of the ignorant, filthy and destitute. ¬†

He got it into his head to find this legendary goddess of a hot corn girl - a pursuit towards which no expense was spared.¬† Lewis fell in love with Kendra McCleester at first sight.¬† She became equally enamored with the handsome young gentleman.¬† He escorted her to the opera, bought her beautiful European garments, instilled in her a taste for wine and sweets.¬† The hot August of 1855, Lewis Van Wooten proposed.

He‚Äôd take her away, he swore to Kendra.¬† Her life in the slums would be forgotten - but her family would not.¬† Lewis promised he‚Äôd find Ann and Kate well-paid work as personal attendants for two of his many female relatives.¬† He‚Äôd send the boys to the finest academy in Manhattan.¬† In one month‚Äôs time, he promised his beloved, he‚Äôd come with a carriage to collect her and her kin. ¬†

On August 28th, 1855, seven days before Lewis returned to retrieve his bride, a fire broke out in the McCleester‚Äôs tenement.

Kate and Kendra lay closest to the window.¬† They‚Äôd remained awake long after nightfall, giggling about flowers and horses and wedding dresses.¬† Kate awoke first, nostrils singed by smoke, and found the walls of the family‚Äôs abode torn apart by angry red flames.¬†

As fate would have it, a cart from the nearby dry goods shop sat in front of the window, loaded high with fabric and sacks of grains.¬† Woken by her sister‚Äôs frantic shaking, before she shook the sleep from her head, Kendra must‚Äôve felt herself fall - as Kate pushed her unceremoniously out the window.¬† Kendra landed rough, atop the cart, but out of further harm‚Äôs way.¬† She picked herself out of the assorted detritus that broke her fall.¬† Seconds later, she heard a thud. ¬†

A smoking creature of nightmares, charred black and red, arose from the same dry goods cart.¬† Kendra screamed as the creature revealed itself to be Kate, with twelve-year-old Arthur‚Äôs blistering body cradled in her arms. ¬†

Arthur McCleester perished before dawn broke.¬† His brothers, and Ann, had already succumbed to smoke and flame by the time Kate found them.¬† Kate herself, unmercifully, survived.¬† The fire melted the right side of her face, leaving a wrinkled mass of scar tissue that resembled uncooked bacon and a blinded eye welded closed.¬† Her right arm had to be amputated above the elbow, her flesh reduced to moist char the consistency of mud.¬† Forever after, even during the hottest days of summer, Kate wore ankle-length skirts and shawls to hide the extent of the abuse the fire had done to her body.

We don‚Äôt know whether Kate thanked God she was able to save one sibling, or if she resented Kendra for her untouched beauty.¬† Kendra may have revered Kate as her savior, or recoiled in fright from the monster who was once her sister and closest confidante.¬† We don‚Äôt know if the two cried together for their lost mother and brothers, or if Kate cursed her more-beloved younger sister for the fortune that had favored her since birth. ¬†

We don‚Äôt know how the sisters‚Äô relationship ended.¬† But a week later, Lewis Van Wooten returned to the Sixth Ward in a carriage drawn by white horses.¬† When Kendra McCleester left with her fiancee, she left alone.

\*\*\*\*\*

Sometime during the post-war years, around 1865, Methodist minister Peter Woods heard the Almighty whisper in his ear.¬† For one week each month, the good reverend would forsake his respectable Fulton Street church.¬† He‚Äôd travel, with a dispatch of disciples, to the bowels of the Sixth Ward, where he‚Äôd hold daily sermons and save the souls of the wretched thieves, prostitutes, and river pirates in the main room of Dropper Wallace‚Äôs dance hall.

Dropper Wallace was an odd choice for a business partner.¬† A compact, big-bellied fellow with a crooked nose and scarred-up fingers - souvenirs of decades spent bare-knuckle brawling - the closest Dropper had ever come to religion was taking the Lord‚Äôs name in vain.¬† His dance hall hussies were infamous for, at Dropper‚Äôs direction, feeding Johnnies cheap whiskey laced with chloroform, then selling these unfortunate marks to the Blue Bell Dogs gang for three dollars a pop.¬† The poor wretch, if he woke at all, would wake to find himself Shanghai‚Äôd, onboard a ship halfway to South Carolina.

But Reverend Woods offered Dropper two dollars a day for the exclusive use of his establishment, and two clams was two clams.

A handful of beggars and bullies from the neighborhood did filter in, by accident or out of curiosity, while the good Reverend preached.¬† Those who stayed cackled and jeered in amusement at all the wrong parts of the Bible - David‚Äôs lusting for Bathsheba, or Lot and his daughters in the cave.¬† Only a precious few earnestly took to Reverend Woods‚Äô teaching.¬† One of that precious number was scarred, scrawny, filthy cripple Kate McCleester.

\*\*\*\*\*

The tenement fire had been a master thief, one that put even the wiliest Five Points gip to shame.¬† In minutes, the fire had stolen from Kate McCleester all she‚Äôd ever had, and all she ever would.¬† It stole her family.¬† It stole her profession - down one eye and one hand, she couldn‚Äôt operate a Singer machine or pick a pocket.¬† It stole her beauty.¬† Though she paled beside her sister, Kate had been a handsome woman in her own right, with a quick wit and sturdy, child-bearing hips.¬† After that terrible night, Kate would never bear children.¬† It became a joke amongst the Five Points youths: that Kate McCleester‚Äôs female parts had been‚Ä¶ welded shut.¬† Cauterized.¬† But no one could say for certain, because any man who caught sight of Kate with her clothes off would immediately turn to stone. ¬†

For months after Kendra‚Äôs departure, Kate wandered the streets, crying in pain, surviving off coins dropped by charitable citizens moved to pity by her ugliness and tears.¬† Finally, she became desperate enough to seek out the assistance of Rebekah Kleiner. ¬†

Rebekah told everyone who‚Äôd listen she‚Äôd offered Kate a floor to sleep on - free of charge - but Kate‚Äôs pride wouldn‚Äôt allow her to accept such charity.¬† Everyone who‚Äôd listen knew Kate‚Äôs refusal of Rebekah‚Äôs generous offer had less to do with pride than the well-known fact Rebekah never did *anything* out of charity.¬† But Kate did enter a business relationship with Mrs. Kleiner.¬† She‚Äôd pay a wholesale rate for bits of fabric, jewelry, and assorted odds-and-ends from the Kleiner Dry Goods shop - items liberated, by Rebekah Kleiner‚Äôs army of child pick-pockets, from careless newcomers at the ferry terminal.¬† Kate would then load her wares into her cart and walk the streets of Manhattan, selling to businessmen and aristocrats and criminals and anyone else whose heart softened at the pathetic sight of her. ¬†

\*\*\*\*\*

Reverend Wood believed he‚Äôd caught Kate McCleester‚Äôs Irish Catholic soul, and he paraded her around like a trophy.¬† His flock, more observant, believed Kate‚Äôs interest in Protestantism was considerably less than her interest in Reverend Woods‚Äô handsome thirty-year-old physician son.

Dr. Clarence Woods accompanied his father to Five Points, where he‚Äôd bandage wounds and dispense ointments.¬† He thought he may write a book about the distinctive physical characteristics of the criminal immigrant class, and his father‚Äôs venture provided him a ripe opportunity for research.¬† He‚Äôd successfully swallowed his distaste for Kate‚Äôs scarred, lopsided face, and kindly took the time to ask questions about her life.¬† Kate, who‚Äôd spent years courting only pity or scorn, lapped up Clarence‚Äôs kindness like a kitten laps a bowl of cream.¬†

She told him tales of her Aunt Molly O‚ÄôDoul, the village midwife around whom rumors of dark sorcery and otherworldly communion circled like flies around dung.  Molly had been an ugly wench: rough and bony, with a beak of a nose and mismatched eyes.¬† But she must‚Äôve cooked herself a potent love potion, because her bed was seldom empty: she procured the amorous attentions of men traveling through town, at least one of whom brought her ‚Äòround the family way, not that he stuck about long enough to find out.¬† The whisperers in the churchyard suggested Molly O‚ÄôDoul did not birth a human child, but a furry black beast that gnawed at her breast with canine teeth.

Kate was likely attempting to stir Clarence Woods‚Äô loins with her talk of depraved copulation.¬† Clarence urged on her yarn-spinning to another end altogether: she proved a goldmine of the sort of provincial blathering he hoped to include in his book.

When Kate McCleester learned the quiet, dark-haired beauty who accompanied Clarence to sermons was his wife and the daughter of prosperous Westchester farmers, Kate embarked on a strange campaign to befriend the sweet young woman.¬† Temperance Woods, a sympathetic and delicate creature, treated the dirty cripple with cordiality matching her husband‚Äôs.¬† The attendees of Reverend Wood‚Äôs sermons - witnesses to Kate‚Äôs evolving relationship with Clarence and Temperance - couldn‚Äôt decide whether Kate was so delusional as to believe she could tempt Clarence away from his lovely, pious bride, or if she simply resented the pair for enjoying the marital bliss she‚Äôd forever be denied. ¬†

One cold Sunday, Clarence Woods allowed Kate to lead him to a secluded spot in the bowels of the dance hall.¬† Ten minutes later, young Dr. Woods‚Äô voice cut through the walls to the assembled congregation.

‚ÄúYou distasteful wretch!‚Äù He screamed.¬† ‚ÄúGoodness and holiness cannot exist in such a hideous monster as you!‚Äù

Dr. Woods reappeared, red-faced and sweating.¬† In front of his dumbstruck father and the sniggering flock, he clutched Temperance‚Äôs hand and lead her away.¬† The two never attended a sermon in Five Points again.¬† By nightfall, the whole Sixth Ward knew Kate McCleester had propositioned the minister‚Äôs son - and been spat out like sour milk. ¬†

That, it was later agreed, was the night Kate McCleester broke. ¬†

Paddy Goode watched her slip a coin to a lieutenant of Rebekah Kleiner, before he led her to a back door of the dry-goods shop.¬† Red Mary, a street-walking owl who found customers amongst sailors along the East River, swore she saw Kate take a wrapped package from a shifty-looking river pirate.¬† And The Mags - a trio of feral waifs under protection of the Blue Bell Dogs gang - reported witnessing Kate, alone in the burned-out former gambling hall that was her occasional home, madly stirring some concoction in a metal pot. ¬†

The Mags swore, upon their dead mothers‚Äô graves, whatever Kate had in that pot glowed with an unnatural light.

The next day, Kate obtained a crate-full of misshapen glass bottles and jars.¬† She began selling, along with her pilfered trinkets from Rebekah Kleiner‚Äôs shop, off-colored white cold cream, tonic for sore throats, and a blue-colored something she swore cured the barrel flu with only a drop. ¬†

Four weeks after that, Temperance Woods was dead. ¬†

She wasn‚Äôt the last.

\*\*\*\*\*

Gabe Callahan was the best safe-cracker east of Philadelphia.¬† If you asked Gabe Callahan, he was the best safe cracker in the country.¬† He told tales of bank vaults cleared in San Francisco, Chicago, and New Orleans.¬† He swore he was a wanted man in six states - but, thanks to Rebekah Kleiner‚Äôs disguises, his wanted posters looked like six different men.¬† In fact, his disguise had been so convincing New Jersey authorities were convinced he was a black man.¬† And Boston thought him Chinese. ¬†

Gabe liked to talk.¬† But, despite his tendency to inflate his own infamy, he'd proved a valuable addition to any criminal enterprise.¬† He sworn his allegiance to the Blue Bell Dogs and to Jig Cleary, the gang‚Äôs leader.¬† Gabe had impressed Jig Cleary, and Jig was not an easy man to impress.¬† A burly bruiser who stood over six feet tall and weighed at least two hundred pounds, Jig earned his moniker because he - pistol in hand - enjoyed forcing beaten opponents to dance a little jig before he thoughtlessly dispatched them with a bullet or a hard knock to the back of the head. ¬†

Gabe, orphaned young, met Kate McCleester when they were both fifteen, both students of Rebekah Kleiner‚Äôs Sunday school for young pick-pockets and sneak-thieves.¬† Gabe had been a criminal prodigy.¬† He masterminded the successful heist of the Bank of Savings on Chambers street - with nary an ounce of blood spilled - before his eighteenth birthday.¬† But the young maestro was not without his Achilles heel. ¬†

Once, Gabe attempted to snatch a police officer‚Äôs copper badge from right under his nose as he sipped coffee at Rona‚Äôs Cafe - earning himself a sound thrashing by nightstick.¬† A gang lieutenant, Frank Greely, carried the foolhardy youth to Hearn‚Äôs Greengrocer, the Blue Bell Dog‚Äôs unofficial clubhouse, and tended his wounds.¬† When Gabe recovered his senses, he confessed to the older man that his unwise choice in marks was inspired by the desire to impress a certain Moira Doolan, the lovely fianc√© of a notorious police captain.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd do best to watch yourself around broads,‚Äù Greely warned.¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be the death of you.‚Äù ¬† ¬†

A rumor was stated, through the Five Points gossip channels, that Gabe and Kate McCleester were affianced.¬† The two young criminals delighted in ribbing and challenging each other.¬† They‚Äôd compete over who could break into a shop faster, or whose bounty would command the greater compensation from Rebekah Kleiner.¬† However, it‚Äôs unlikely Kate harbored any intention to marry Gabe.¬† For if her sister married Lewis Van Wooten, and Van Wooten - as promised - found Kate a position as a ladies‚Äô maid, she could‚Äôve snared a mate of much higher status than a scrawny Five Points gangster.¬† A young tradesman, perhaps.¬† Or a clerk or bookkeeper.¬† But after the fire - after her sister‚Äôs abrupt departure - Gabe Callahan became Kate‚Äôs last remaining option.

As it turned out, she was left with no options at all.¬† Gabe, horrified by her monstrous appearance, wanted nothing to do with his childhood fancy. ¬†

\*\*\*\*\*

Four months after Temperance Woods‚Äô death, Gabe Callahan became terrified of dogs.

One night, he‚Äôd stolen away to St. Bridget‚Äôs Church, by the Seaport, with Frank Greely and James Shannon.¬† The priest there had been Jig Cleary‚Äôs childhood confessor back home in Sligo.¬† Out of lingering affection, he allowed Jig‚Äôs companions use of a hidden compartment behind a portrait of St. Michael fighting the dragon for‚Ä¶ well, the gangsters never specified their exact need of a discrete stashing spot, and the priest wisely didn‚Äôt ask questions to which he didn‚Äôt desire an answer. ¬†

In actuality, the Blue Bell Dogs didn‚Äôt use the compartment for much - only short-term storage of goods, when they had them, too conspicuous to fence immediately.¬† That night, they‚Äôd been sent to retrieve a ruby pendant liberated from the safe of an Astor cousin, a love token for his Swedish mistress. ¬†

Stray dogs slept in the church yard, as the priest had a soft spot for the creatures.¬† The Blue Bell Dogs typically ignored their animal namesakes.¬† But, as the trio moved stealthily through the dark graveyard behind the church with the ruby pendant, Gabe Callahan let out a violent cry.

‚ÄúThe dogs!‚Äù He shouted.¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the size of horses!‚Äù

His two compatriots found him thrashing about, knife in hand, engaged in shadowboxing with a mangy brown mutt.¬† They disarmed their companion and dragged him away, desperate to quiet him before they drew the attention of the coppers - or worse, marauding river pirates.¬† Gabe insisted the three had been stalked by a monstrous black dog with jaws like an alligator‚Äôs, a ram‚Äôs horns sprouting from its head.

Soon, Gabe had been all but pushed out of gang business, and for good reason: his fits of delusion became more frequent, and more dramatic.¬† He could be found wandering the docks of the East River, lunging at the air with his dagger and screaming curses about ‚Äúthe black dogs with human arms and yellow teeth.‚Äù¬† He almost met a bloody end at the hands of the Mud Ghouls gang, river pirates who took offense to his yelling his head off outside the hiding-holes where they lurked, stalking ships at the docks. ¬†

Gabe was saved, however, by a patrolling police officer named John Staub, whose presence prompted the pirates to scatter.¬† Staub, an ambitious young man hoping to advance his position within the police force, spent most of his evenings pacing the docks.¬† On July the 5th, the day after Independence Day, he watched Gabe sprint towards the water, howling like a banshee.¬† He started after the disturbed man, but couldn‚Äôt catch him before he disappeared below the dark, murky waters.

An hour later, Officer Staub pulled Gabe‚Äôs cold body off a pile of discarded timber, where it had washed ashore like wreckage. ¬†

News of Gabe Callahan‚Äôs death seized the Sixth Ward in its mighty maw and didn‚Äôt let go.¬† Five Points dwellers recalled the tale of Temperance Woods; her husband and father-in-laws‚Äô insistence she‚Äôd been poisoned.¬† Those sober and of reasonable intelligence connected the two demises - the pious beauty and the thieving gangster.¬† Both died at their own hands.¬† Both were haunted by monstrous black dogs.¬† And both incurred the vengeful, jealous wrath of Kate McCleester.

\*\*\*\*\*

Whenever Dropper Wallace‚Äôs dance hall wasn‚Äôt being utilized as a makeshift church for Reverend Woods, it existed as an establishment called The London Owl, a den of pleasure.¬† Wallace employed only the most beautiful and charming girls to serve as paid companions to his wealthy clients.¬† He paid the procurers better than other proprietors; they allowed him first pick of their stock: young women, lured to the city with promises of money, love, or adventure; destined for betrayal, brutality, and destitution.¬†

Once, Dropper Wallace had his sights set on Kendra McCleester.¬† He promised a princely bounty to any procurer who attained the beautiful Hot Corn Girl; he knew, once his lustful clients were teased with a glimpse of the angelic beauty, he could name his price.¬† The thugs tailed Kendra to and from the Miss Julie Clay Academy, waiting for an opportunity to snatch the pretty girl like wild game.¬† But Kendra never strayed from well-populated streets unless escorted by her brothers, a trusted friend like Gabe Callahan, or her sister Kate, whose skill with a knife rivaled any man. ¬†

One afternoon, Kate McCleester appeared on the doorstep of The London Owl and insisted the hired goons take her to Dropper Wallace.¬† He received the young woman in his office, where he'd busied himself counting the money his girls had charmed out of their nightly companions and stacking it in his safe.¬† Kate implored Dropper to let her sister be.¬† Kendra, she explained, was being courted by a young man who wished to marry her.¬† As a trade, Kate offered her own services as a lady of the night.¬† She could make more money separating men from *their* money than she could as a sweat shop girl or a pickpocket. ¬†

Dropper considered Kate‚Äôs offer.¬† Then, he undid his trousers.¬† If Kate desired employment at his establishment, she needed to prove to him she could perform her duties to his satisfaction.

After Dropper had been satisfied, he laughed in Kate‚Äôs face.¬† He had no use for a plain Irish peasant.¬† Kate should scurry along now and secure herself a husband while she still could, before the scant womanly charms she did possess withered away with age.¬† She was already twenty years old.¬† Practically an old maid. ¬†

September of 1868 was an unseasonably cool one in Manhattan.¬† At The London Owl, coquettes-for-hire in short dresses sat at golden tables with their paying paramours of the night, watching a traveling French burlesque troupe kick higher than their heads.¬† Scarlet, a red-headed German girl, poured another glass of Italian cabernet for Iron Jaw Patrick McDonald, the leader of The Thumper Crew, a Bowery gang specialized in thuggish enforcement for hire. ¬†

Iron Jaw revealed, barely concealed glee in his voice, he‚Äôd seen two of the three Mags lurking about like Irish alleycats.¬† The Mags, three orphaned girls all called Maggie, lived as wards under the protection of Jig Cleary.¬† Jig provided them sustenance and shelter; they provided him with their earnings from pickpocketing and flower-selling and street-sweeping, and information gleaned from networks of street boys and girls who pursued similar employment.¬† Iron Jaw had caught sight of the blonde Mag and the red-haired Mag spying on Dropper‚Äôs marks; he didn‚Äôt know what had become of their raven-haired third, but he knew the presence of two Mags signaled Jig Cleary planned to claim a portion of Dropper‚Äôs nightly earnings, by threat or by force. ¬†

Delilah, a sensuous quadroon who‚Äôd migrated north from Mississippi after the war, fed sliced oranges to Ned Worther, a New York Commissioner of Sanitation.¬† Or Commissioner of Safety.¬† Delilah didn‚Äôt know, and Ned didn‚Äôt, either.¬† A loyalist of Tammany Hall, his sole job duty was the prompt collection of bribes.¬† He regaled his comely companion with a tale of heroism and civic duty: the New York City police force, supported by Tammany Hall, had busted up a gang of pirates looking to rob a brig called the Sunshine Jane, docked in the East River.¬† The hero of the day had been a young officer named John Staub, who‚Äôd silently stalked the Mud Ghouls for months and planned the entire operation.¬†

Sally Joan, a Westchester farm girl with a halo of auburn curls, massaged the chest of Andrew Darlington, heir to a timber fortune. They watched the French dancers finish their set with a rowdy shaking of their breasts. ¬†

The music stopped.

Scarlett dropped her bottle of Cabernet.¬† It shattered across the floor, splattering Iron Jaw McDonald with red wine.¬† She leapt from his lap and stood stock-still, her face a mask of horror, one finger pointing towards a dark corner. ¬†

‚ÄúThe dog!‚Äù¬† She cried.¬† ‚ÄúThe black dog!¬† He‚Äôs staring at me.‚Äù

Delilah let out a wail.¬† ‚ÄúThe black dog has horns, and he‚Äôs grasping for me with human hands!‚Äù

Sally Joan strengthened her grip on Andrew Darlington until she practically strangled the man.

‚ÄúThey speak!‚Äù¬† She screamed.¬† ‚ÄúThey serve the Lord of the Day!‚Äù

‚ÄúThe black dog is standing on two legs!‚Äù Another woman added.

‚ÄúThe Lord of the Day desires us as his brides!‚Äù¬†

And then, the men of the London Owl saw what the women saw.¬† They saw great dogs, the size of elephants, standing on filthy hooved feet.¬† They saw their hands, five-fingered like those of a man, beckoning.¬† They looked into the black dogs‚Äô glowing eyes; their ram-like horns, their matted fur. ¬†

With a cacophony of screams, the girls fled the brothel, tearing at their clothes as they went.¬† The French minxes and their musicians, confused, dashed out after them.¬† The customers - not wishing to lounge around a prostitution den infiltrated by monstrous black dogs - followed the women.¬† The London Owl staff, watching their paychecks walk out the door, gave chase.¬† Finally, even Dropper Wallace was drawn from his office and into the street; he barked and threatened as the women, in various states of undress, clasped hands and, still wailing, began to dance. ¬†

The men, simultaneously aroused and repulsed, fell into a state of reverie.¬† Some swore, later, they saw giant horned-and-hooved dog men, bodies covered with black fur, writhing and twirling along, human hands pressed against the girls‚Äô gyrating bodies.¬† This fantasy was crushed by the arrival of Jig Cleary and seventeen Blue Bell Dogs, summoned by The Mags, armed with brick-bats.¬† Lured by the promise of delusion and disarray, Jig intended to exploit the situation for all it was worth. ¬†

It‚Äôs said that Iron Jaw McDonald took down three Blue Bell Dogs with only his belt as a weapon.¬† That a giant black wolf walking on two feet lifted Dropper‚Äôs bullies, one by one, and smashed their heads against the hard dirt ground.¬† That Jig Cleary beat Dropper to death on the floor of his own dance hall, splattering his brains into every nook and sinful cranny.¬† That Jig Cleary himself fell when a counterfeit Roman statue toppled from its pedestal and landed on top of him.¬† That the police, when they arrived to break up the brawl, found men lying in pools of their own blood, exsanguinating from gashes that resembled the bite of an African lion.

Apparently, one rascal or another had managed to rob The London Owl - Dropper‚Äôs safe was found open and empty.¬† Jig Cleary survived his injuries, but he was never the same.¬† His mind regressed to that of a child.¬† He took to wandering the streets of the Sixth Ward, earning the pity and disgust of travelers by begging them to locate his mother. ¬†

This time, even the simple and drunken denizens of Five Points could draw a straight line between Kate McCleester and the monstrous black dogs of The London Owl.¬† On the streets, people discussed Kate‚Äôs Modus Operandi - had she, a transient who lived between abandoned buildings, managed to cook up a poison so potent it drove its victims to madness and despair, while remaining tasteless and undetectable?¬† The name of Molly, Kate‚Äôs medicine-woman aunt, danced about the lips of every Kerry migrant.¬† Was Kate, in fact, a witch out of sixteenth-century delusion, who could unlock the gates of the underworld and command its fiends to do her bidding?

Then, the gossips began to speculate over Kate‚Äôs next target.¬† She aimed her witchery at those whose beauty she coveted, or who had betrayed her in some fashion.

Speculation was barely necessary.¬† Only one woman satisfied both criteria.

I honestly have a hard time introducing myself sometimes. This is one of those sometimes. So I'm going to yap hahaha 

Random information ahead... 

I'm an awkward person. I come off as things I am not. I am quirky. 

I'm very homey is what I like to think. I enjoy cooking, I like poetry, artsy things and design. I love siteseeing and walking around aimlessly. 

I have two favorite cafes I frequent in the city I live in. Funny that I'm always at those places but never actually order coffee. Coffee has been off my diet ever since I started taking some of my medicines.I order teas, spicy drinks, and freezes.
I love strawberry things and cinnamon things. And as I am typing this ofcourse I started craving something sweet.

I recently invested in a little journal that could fit in any of my bags. I'll be using it to write down interesting thoughts. I think I'm going to really enjoy making writing a habit again. 

I have also been into styling lately. I was never the girl to be so aware of what she looked like and how she presented herself. I only got into expressing myself through what I wear in college. Some of my favorite things to wear are long skirts, dresses and quirky jewelry. I'm still building up the confidence to be more expressive. 

Oh! I have an interesting shoe collection!   
I've got a pair of sparkly loafers, sparkly sneakers, heels that are too high for my own good and a bunch of other stuff. I'm surprised I've got such an interesting collection when I have a hard time finding shoes where I live. Feet big. 

Anyway that's enough yapping... 

I hope that was entertaining! Bye for now.

Look, I get it. Losing all of your stuff sucks ass. But food poisoning isn‚Äôt a great alternative. 

First, remove EVERYTHING. Even the sealed bottles of sodas or whatever. 

If you want to try to claim a loss through insurance, photograph all items from the fridge and freezer. Photograph the inside of the fridge and freezer, with closeups on suspected mold and leaks. 

Before cleaning, turn off the appliance. Cleaning in the cold sucks and you‚Äôre wasting power. 

Take out shelves, drawers, organizing bins, etc. and wash them. There is likely mold growing in spots you didn‚Äôt know existed. 

Personally I spray them down in the bath/shower. If that seems icky, just don‚Äôt set the shelf or drawer down inside the bath/shower. When wiping out the interior, get every annoying nook and cranny. 

For the interior of the fridge and the shelving & drawers, you can use dish soap. Some folks may wanna try bleach. Just be careful of steamy bleach fumes when using hot water. 

For persistent bad smells, you can try vinegar and water. Other options are activated charcoal, coffee grounds, and baking soda. 

Let everything dry before turning the appliances back on and proceeding to re-stock. 

You absolutely MUST toss:

- meat
- dairy
- eggs
- cheese: soft, block, shredded, all of it. 
- Tofu and meat substitutes 
- Alternative milks

- Alcohol: The kind of alcohol I‚Äôm assuming you have in your fridge is Bailey‚Äôs and those pre-made cocktails. If you can promise me the seal was not broken, wash the outside of the container and keep it. Otherwise, don‚Äôt chug that Bailey‚Äôs. 

- baked goods

- Baking ingredients: flour, opened flaxseed, opened wheat bran, etc

- Pickled items that have been opened/jar seal is broken

- Fruits and veggies: considering the e-coli recalls going on right now, it‚Äôs not worth risking!

- Condiments: yes, even your ketchup. Even your opened bottle of A1 or hot sauce. 

- Medicine: This is the difficult one. If you need to get a medication replaced due to a lack of refrigeration, photograph the medicine, keep the prescription label, contact the pharmacy for disposal instructions, then call your doctor. This is also valid for veterinary medicine.

- Pet food

‚ÄúI heard you can still keep‚Ä¶‚Äù

Yes those things exist. But if any of it was opened, or isn‚Äôt airtight, this might not be worth the risk. Especially since by now the risk of mold is upon us.

‚ÄúWhat about weed?‚Äù 

Unless the seal was still intact on the jar you got your flower in, I personally wouldn‚Äôt smoke it if it was left in the fridge or freezer. Also I smoked all of my weed while the power was out because I was so bored. ",6,1732413949.0,eastside,2,0.75,False

The days stretch before me, not as a blank slate, but as a canvas already painted, layered with memories, emotions, fragments of life lived. How strange it is to live twice through pain: once in the moment, sharp and searing, and then again in the quiet cruelty of recollection. To write is not to escape, but to make peace‚Äîto sit beside these feelings, these specters of what was, and give them a voice.

They come, as they always do, without warning or permission. In the morning, as I sip my coffee, there they are, pulling at the edges of my thoughts. In the bath, they float up, unbidden, with the steam. During conversations, they whisper over the words of others, drowning them out, stealing my presence, my now. They are with me at the streetlight, just before the abrupt, jarring horn of the impatient driver behind me. They linger as I speak on the phone with clients, their obliviousness pressing against my own quiet discontent.

And when I speak with my son, they remain, lingering in the shadows, nudging my words. And I wonder, is this really me speaking, guiding, or is this anxiety made into words? 
Every interaction with him feels like an echo of something unresolved within me, as though I am nurturing not only the boy before me, but also the child I once was. His laughter, his worries, his questions‚Äîeach stirs something in me, a quiet reckoning between who I was and who I am.

They are even with me when my eyes close for the night. They seep into my dreams, taking shape as long-buried memories, unbidden and unwelcome. Resurrected to haunt me, to remind me, to keep me chained to the past. I wake heavy, as though each memory is a boulder that has pressed against my chest through the night, leaving me gasping for the lightness of day. But morning does not bring reprieve.

These companions of mine‚Äîalways whispering, always present‚Äîrefuse to be ignored. And so, I write. Not to silence them, but to give them shape.

In the spring of 2019, I (F, now 35) started psychotherapy with a licensed phychologist (M, now about 46) who has a PhD in therapeutic hypnotherapy and practices CBT and EMDR. It was initially remote, then I moved back to my home country and chose to build a life for myself in the city where he lived.

From the beginning, there was some tension ‚Äì I felt that he was into me and that he was a rather emotional person. It also rapidly became clear to me that he very much defines himself as a psychologist; he works non stop and his career as a therapist and teacher is really his life.

The se*ual tension between us plateaued around 2020-2021. I thought it was part of the process, but I also really struggled with coming to terms with the idea that I was just projecting something unto our therapeutic relationship, as he often would share rather specific personal information (such as that he had an ex girlfriend with my name and former career choice). It had come to the point where I once asked him about his relationship status and got mad at him for not being married or wearing a ring when it became clear that he was in a loving relationship with the mother of his daughter. He was visibly very much in love with her.

At the end of 2021, I started seeing someone and the tension with my psychotherapist dropped immediately.

My companion started therapy with him a few months ago, while I was planning on seeing another therapist as I felt that I needed a different kind of help to move forward (turns out I have ADHD and probably am autistic, neither of which he was able to find out). Meanwhile, my relationship with my boyfriend ended (although we remain close).

Before my last session, my psychotherapist wrote to me that he had a dream about me and asked if I was ok. He seemed concerned. When we met, he explained that he dreamt that we had sexual intercourse in his office and that I had a serious accident when I left (there were no more details except that the intercourse was enjoyable for both).

When I confronted him about telling me this dream, he was kind of dismissive: 'oh it's just a dream', 'if I'd known it would be a big deal, I wouldn't have told you' and 'I was just being impulsive, you know I have ADHD'

I went on with the session, which was supposed to be our last; at some point I asked him how things were at home and he said that his relationship was ending, that he would be moving out shortly; that he had done what he always advised his patients against, ending his marital relationship within months of one of his parents dying. I immediately had vertigo; he wanted to proceed with EMDR, but I told him that I was totally into him, that we really had experienced a major love story and that I couldn't be his patient anymore now that we were both single; to which he replied that an intimate relationship between us would be ince*tuous, and he seemed in shock. I told him we could always grab coffee as friends one day and gave him homemade cake I'd brought for him.

Since then, I've whatsapped him to compliment him on his work and tell him that I was there for him if he wanted to talk. He just replied that that would be inappropriate; in the end I angrily told him that he was protecting himself from me now way more that he ever protected me from him in our sessions, and asked for some explanation ‚Äì he left my message on unread for 5 days before finally expressing that I was misunderstanding transference, that he had no availability for facing my aggressiveness. that he had always supported me throughout conflicts with my loved ones (which instances he listed) as well as his need for peaceful closure.

That still holds true to be honest, I was still rather sleepy and still got distracted. However, I skipped my usual routine of waking up at like 7 and taking it then waking up at 9 since I wanted to try waking up at around 8:30 to take it with breakfast to see if that made it better. I kept falling back asleep and the next time I woke up, it was nearly 4pm‚Ä¶ and I could barely bring myself to stay awake or focus when I attempted to study later on. Realised that it has been helping me, and moving out of that routine for one day really showed me how fucked things were for me. The one thing I have noticed though is the lack of hunger. I‚Äôm not eating out of boredom and I can just ignore the fact that it‚Äôs lunchtime sometimes. On my first day I was up from 8-3am on just 2 soft boiled eggs and a coffee lol. I‚Äôve been eating around one ish meals in the evening every time I take vyvanse, along with a bit of snacks.

I‚Äôm not exactly feeling the ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù that a lot of people here feel on this drug, but I can see that what I thought was my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù was actually me really being helped out.

I don‚Äôt know if I need a higher or lower dose,,, I‚Äôm thinking of getting my thyroid checked though because my hypersomnia is kind of insane. I only really get up sometimes because I ask my partner to wake me up and have a conversation with me in the morning to get me up and about.

I guess it‚Äôs also because I‚Äôve lived with awful executive functioning for so long that I‚Äôm still breaking out of a lot of those habits. My cognitive abilities and processing speed have not suddenly increased unfortunately, but I didn‚Äôt expect that really. It‚Äôs been years of being treated for the wrong thing.

Safety concerns = no lattes, no cappuccinos, no mocha frappes. üçÆ A total 13,500 stores affected = $193M in financial black holes. But wait‚Äîit gets worse. If they don‚Äôt fix this fast, this could be McDonald‚Äôs ice cream machine scandal 2.0‚Äîwith espresso.

The Drama
You know how they‚Äôre always like, ‚ÄúSorry, the ice cream machine‚Äôs broken‚Äù? Well, now the espresso machines are dead too. McDonald‚Äôs had to RIP them out of every U.S. location because of some ‚Äúunspecified safety concern.‚Äù I mean, who‚Äôs getting hurt by a cappuccino? Karen‚Äôs third-degree burn from asking for ‚Äúextra hot‚Äù? üî•‚òï

The Numbers
Here‚Äôs where it gets wild, fam. McDonald‚Äôs serves 27.2M customers a day in the U.S.:
	‚Ä¢	810K espresso drinks lost per day = $2.4M/day in lost sales.
	‚Ä¢	People skipping meals because no coffee = another $1.2M/day gone.
	‚Ä¢	That‚Äôs $153M in lost profit if this drags on for 60 days.
	‚Ä¢	Oh, and replacing the machines? Another $40.5M.

Total burn? $193M. That‚Äôs nearly **13% of their quarterly

1gyfp12,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/1gyfp12/speakeasy_how_a_pharmacist_built_an_aipowered/,SpeakEasy: How a Pharmacist Built an AI-Powered Multilingual Conversation App,"https://preview.redd.it/37qn4x0x7r2e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3f7cae7b2b0313617b6f8aa8244233402eb6d53



**Background**

Hello! I‚Äôm the sole developer of **SpeakEasy**, an app designed to help users practice conversations in various languages, including English, with the help of AI. My professional background is completely unrelated to language learning or programming‚ÄîI‚Äôm a pharmacist in South Korea. However, I‚Äôve always been passionate about learning English and previously studied programming languages like C, C++, and Python in depth. I‚Äôve long dreamed of creating an app to aid in language learning.

In August 2023, I had a one-week summer break from work. With some free time after dropping off my child at daycare, I decided to dive into programming. At the time, AI-assisted coding with tools like ChatGPT was trending, so I challenged myself to develop the app entirely on my own, with substantial support from AI.


**Considerations Before Development**

The most critical factor I considered before starting development was **maintainability**. As a solo developer, I knew maintaining the app would be challenging, so I aimed to build it with a manageable and well-structured design from the start. The last thing I wanted was to create spaghetti code, which I had struggled with in past projects, ultimately abandoning them due to unmanageable bugs.

To address this, I organized the project using the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture and frequently relied on ChatGPT for refactoring suggestions. Instead of managing a dedicated server, I opted to use cloud services whenever possible. Additionally, I implemented aggressive caching mechanisms to reuse data fetched from the server, minimizing unnecessary requests. For example, when users upload profile pictures, only compressed thumbnail versions are displayed. This approach has kept operational costs negligible, even with over 1,000 active users.


**Initial Features**

At the start, I planned to include a wide range of features in the app. Here‚Äôs the development sequence:

1. **AI Conversation Practice in English**: Similar to [Character.AI](http://Character.AI), but with a unique twist‚Äîusers interact only through spoken language (no text input). The AI evaluates their proficiency in real-time and awards experience points based on their performance.
2. **Flashcard Feature**: Designed for vocabulary learning.
3. **Random Voice Chat**: Allows users to connect and chat with random individuals via voice. I used an external API for this.
4. **Real-Time Chat**: Text-based instant messaging.
5. **Community Forum**: A space for users to interact and share ideas.

I managed to implement all of these features within approximately four months.


**Shifts in Development Direction**

After completing these initial features, I reflected on the app‚Äôs direction and made some significant changes. Here are a few noteworthy adjustments:

1. **Removal of Random Voice Chat**: This feature was removed to comply with Apple‚Äôs app review guidelines. It‚Äôs a decision I still regret, as it was a feature I was particularly excited about.
2. **Expanding Beyond English**: Initially, the app focused exclusively on English conversations. However, I decided to enable practice in every language globally. This was a bold move because it risked diluting the app‚Äôs original purpose. While I‚Äôm still analyzing the data, I‚Äôm continually evaluating whether offering AI conversation practice in all languages is the right approach.


**Link**

You can find the app on the App Store and Play Store via the links below. Although it‚Äôs still a work in progress, I‚Äôm eager to hear your honest feedback and suggestions as I refine its direction.

He works graveyard shifts a hospital. He's not medical staff, he cleans the rooms. Anyway, I just don't think that it's good for him, or at the very least the hours aren't. Im sure the pay is great but he''s always tierd and sometimes stays up 24 hours (or more) just to keep up with his social life. No one pressures him to, he chooses too. He chugs coffee and thinks that fixes it but then he just crashes hard. 
Another thing I'm worried about is his potential. He has an insane amount of creativity. You mainly see it in his minecraft builds. I know that minecraft builds aren't anything huge but his really are amazing. Plus he's always got these really cool ideas of stuff that he wished mojang would add to minecraft, to wich I'd normally reply ""you know dude, if you put all these ideas into a game of your own, I think it'd be something great."" I always tell him how great his design skills and ideas are but he just says he's no good at translating his minecraft build skills into 3d modeling and he's doesn't know the first thing about making a game so there's really nothing he can do with his skills.
But I think he's wrong. I just don't know what to suggest to him cuz I don't know anything either. Seeing him constantly tierd from a job where he can't use his creativity kills me.

1gyflew,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gyflew,Pine Valley Tagaytay,"ü¶¢ During my recent trip to Tagaytay, I visited Patio Espresso, a charming coffee shop tucked away in a compound that also features a separate restaurant and event space. I ordered my go-to, an iced Spanish Latte priced at 120 pesos, and I have to say, it was a delightful experience. The coffee was perfectly balanced, and I didn‚Äôt have the usual sore throat that sometimes accompanies iced drinks. Every sip was just right, making it worth the price, and I‚Äôd definitely go back for another round.

üß∏ I also had a chance to try my friend‚Äôs cinnamon roll, which was 85 pesos. While I‚Äôm not usually a fan of cinnamon rolls, especially with nuts, I could still appreciate the value. It‚Äôs a decent-sized portion for the price, so if you enjoy that sort of thing, you‚Äôd probably like it.

‚õ≤Ô∏è As for the location, it‚Äôs somewhat hidden, adding to its charm, but it‚Äôs definitely a place that shines in the evening when the lights give it a whole new vibe. I‚Äôd recommend visiting at night for the best experience. Also, a heads-up: even at 2 PM, the breeze in Tagaytay can be chilly, so don‚Äôt forget your jacket. The venue itself is cozy with a lovely fountain and ample parking space, making it a pleasant spot to relax.

ü§ç Overall, I‚Äôm glad I found this place, and it‚Äôs one I‚Äôd happily visit again for a peaceful coffee break in Tagaytay.",2,1732412165.0,ITookAPicturePH,1,1.0,False

Thoughts? ,"Hello every body! It's been a while since I posted in this subreddit. I'm currently no longer actively dating, but it was due to my current encounter with my last hinge connection. 
I know, the title makes me sound like I'm an asshole. 
But, I had to make the difficult decision to cut off a strong connection I had due to his depression, and lack of us seeing each other. Whether it was an excuse or not, I will not know. 
We began talking on hinge at the end of September. He was actually my strongest connection on there and we had a lot to talk about, and best of all he lived in my area. The problem was, he just moved back from living in a different country and he was unemployed. He expressed that to me early on so I had no expectations and often times on our dates, I had offered to pay but he refused. 
As we began talking, things were progressing naturally. The only denominator was why hasn't he brought up meeting? 
Before we officially met 2 weeks after texting, i had offered in between this time frame that we go get coffee, or we can meet somewhere. 
he insisted that he likes following traditional male roles and for our first date, wants to pick me up. 
we had our first date, and it was fine. i was incredibly nervous, and i figured first date nervousness was huge into play. he was really quiet. 
one week later, we had our second date. 
another week later, our third. 
and about two weeks was going by and he has not mentioned any date or seeing me. and he expressed to me that he ""has to be forced"" to leave the house. and this was a bit of an uncomfortable conversation as I asked him, ""are you just not as interested in me because we don't see each other enough for living in the same area?"" And he ended up stating as well that he is a slow burn type of relationship guy. 
And after he was called out, then he made plans with me. 
Again, another two weeks go by and nothing. His texting with me began to become less, and I had already considered the possibility that he is dating others. And I get it, but I expressed to him that I wanted it to lead into a relationship, to which he agreed and said he wanted the same. 
But within this last week or so, the texting was almost non existent. And I had asked him if he was okay, to which he responded no. His depression is getting the best of him, he misses the country in which he lived, and he is sick of being unemployed. 
So, I made the decision to tell him due to his mental health, I wish him nothing but the best but I do believe we are in different stages with different expectations. 
For the record: I would invite him to see me as often as I can. I invited him to bars, movies, drinks, and even to go to a rave with me next weekend. He declined all. I had also invited him to my work vacations where I had rooms payed for if I want to have somebody else come with me. 
Our relationship turned purely sexual over text incredibly fast. 
I honestly think he wanted to keep his options open, but this is also my very first time putting my foot down. I'm a firm believer that if you don't have time to dedicate to somebody else, don't date. ",3,1732412126.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

Our Lelit coffee machine has started tripping the RCD. It only does it intermittently, maybe once a fortnight.
It only happens when we press the steam button. 
I'm almost certain it is a Neutral to Earth fault, as it will still trip the RCD even when the switch on the machine is off. For example, when it is in fault condition, I'll switch the machine off, plug it back into the outlet and the RCD instantly trips. 
I have also noticed that when I use the blind filter to clean the machine, water starts coming out of the grinder outlet and other small holes above the group head. So clearly there is a leak somewhere and it is shorting Neutral to Earth.

Basically a red flag in a man,"So I was dating my gf now ex for more than a year and a half at this point and she switched majors to psychology, she met this tutor who helped her with her coding for a class. Then next semester he decides to take classes that she has to be with her even though he was 2 years more advanced in the program. 

She starts doing projects with him because he his a friend now and helped her and whatever, but he starts to be touchy and laying on her all the time, putting his arm around her when they have like meetings for the projects and stuff.

She tells me about it, and I told her to tell him something if she was uncomfortable like she said she was, but I guess she didn‚Äôt. 

Anyways, he starts being closer to her opening up about somewhat trauma that he has and my ex had too in her childhood so they talked about it. This guy started buying her coffee all the time and would complain to my ex about getting rejected by some girls he went on dates with because they were looking for assholes and how he was one of the ‚Äúnice guys‚Äù and my ex told me how true it was wtv. 

Me and my ex had a fight because of her lying and she went to complain to him about me, and he started telling her how much better he would treat her.

Then things went back to normal she invited him and her 2 other friends to go to the bar, and while we were at our place he started literally being jealous and would notice him get angry when my gf at the time would kiss me or something. He couldn‚Äôt even look at me in the eyes or talk to me when I asked him anything or tried to have a conversation. Then we went to the bar and he started doing cocaine (he told his buddy and I heard him). I noticed him being touchy with my ex and didn‚Äôt say anything but I asked her about it later.

 A month goes by, he calls my ex at 3am (she told me she didn‚Äôt respond), but I found out she lied again, she told me he broke his arm and was in the hospital drunk, telling my ex about his feelings for her. She said he was acting weird and creepy and they didn‚Äôt talk for like a month I believe, then I went on a work trip for 3 weeks, all was good came for 8 days then left for another 3 weeks, but by week 1 she started being rude with me and cancelled plans, then on the next weekend she travelled 3 hours to go see her friends, they all went to eat pizza, then the next day they went to the bar with friends, the guy started being possessive of her so bad that she texted me that she was somehow freaking out, I told her I would pay her a cab to go home, she pulled some excuse, said she would call me back later. She got home at 2 am, called me started saying how weird he was and harassing her and stuff then undressed herself and talk how I was the man of her life etc. 

In the morning I wake up we were supposed to call each other again, and she‚Äôs at this guy‚Äôs house. I keep asking her where she was (I knew) and she would send me bikini pics, but said nothing. Then she admitted and said he just couldn‚Äôt resist her last night because he was drunk, so I asked her why would she go there and not respect our relationship then. She went on a rant of how good he was to her and how nice he was. I didn‚Äôt respond to her then at night I tried to talk to her again she said she was busy, she went on a date at the beach with him, so I said I was done. 

She started calling me insecure, name calling me etc. When I literally told her why was she complaining about him harassing her then going to his house, also she was basically disrespecting the relationship at this point.

So yeah I guess, she cheated and they have been together for 5 months now. 

Is it not a red flag how possessive and jealous this guy was like do woman actually like that? I used to say stuff like ‚Äúall woman like assholes, I am a nice guy‚Äù when I was like 16. How the hell is he a ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù acting like that? This would signal to me that he would be incredibly jealous and manipulative if I were with him in a relationship. 

I talked to a therapist about what I could do better for my future relationship, and what she has done the whole 2 years, her lying and stuff and she said it‚Äôs because she grew up in a chaotic household as a child, so she likes to create this environnement and the reason she ‚Äúmicro cheated‚Äù and lied a lot during our time.",1,1732411691.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

We would be able to go down to one car, which would make it more affordable since for 2 years it will primarily be my salary paying the bills(I make between 110-120k) and I save time / money from driving downtown and to the airport by taking the UP express.

1gyfcfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gyfcfu/is_this_too_direct/,Is this too direct ,"So here‚Äôs my story. 48(M). Recently started dating after a cordial divorce. I‚Äôve been on several 1st dates and a handful of 2nd and 3rds. I‚Äôm a monogamous guy, not looking for casual hookups, but also trying to find someone to vibe with that I‚Äôm also attracted to. Doing a bit of online dating right now, and I recently met a 35(F) and have been on an initial meet up over coffee and a recent dinner date. Conversations both times went well. I‚Äôm really attracted to her and she‚Äôs made comments to me making me think the feeling is mutual. I usually have a pretty good read if a woman is into me. If I initiate a physical touch and they respond, or if they lean in when I‚Äôm talking to them, stuff like that. The non-verbal cues. This girl is much tougher to read. Her nationality is Cambodian and when I shared this story with my friend, he jokingly relied, that Asians are typically very good at poker. So here‚Äôs my ask of the group, I asked her out tomorrow for a meet up while we are both out running errands. If I‚Äôm not picking up a vibe, is it too aggressive to ask a comment such as, ‚ÄúI find you really attractive and really enjoy spending time with you, but I‚Äôm having a really tough time reading if you are interested in me‚Äù? If you disagree with that approach, what would you do. 

*a bit of extra context, the first time I met her, she made a comment that most guys typically appear normal until the 5th or 6th date, so I‚Äôm assuming she may have had a couple bad situations recently where new relationships may have quickly turned sour ",1,1732411390.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1gyf95q,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1gyf95q/trip_report_extremely_last_minute_winter_escape/,Trip Report: Extremely Last Minute Winter Escape (10 Days),"Has anyone else planned a trip with short notice? Definitely a fun rush!!! Overall I think Japan has so many options (lodging, good restaurants, etc) that you'd be okay not pre-booking or planning anything.

For context, I got a new job and immediately bought a ticket with all of my points since I had some free time. I only had one week to figure out my itinerary but I've spent a lot of time in Japan, especially Tokyo, so I wanted to focus on new sights. Luckily, my family in Tokyo let me stay with them, which took a huge load off!

Let me know what you think! Nearly everything was part of my itinerary. Looking it over now, I would've splurged on nicer food and done a side-trip to Kawagoe or Ito. I think I need at least a few nights to explore the Izu peninsula on my next trip, though :)

Day 1: Arrived and had a late konbini dinner (ideal start).

Day 2: Tried to get my shopping done early in Harajuku and Shibuya but the stores all seem different now. Ended up going to Shimokitazawa for Hakko Department (amazing) and vintage clothes (major dud).

Day 3: Went to a glass art workshop that I booked online - 10/10! Later drank around Ikebukuro and shopped more.

Day 4: Visited a friend in Machida, a totally unplanned day but a new area for me.

Day 5: Went to the the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation aka Miraikan. This was a sleeper hit! I'm still thinking about some of those crazy AI creations. Also hit up Toyosu Market and had some sushi at a famous standing-only spot.

I originally wanted to do an Ito day trip but it would've been a 14+ hour day... So glad I didn't right before going to the mountains!

Day 6: Tokyo to Hakuba via super-comfy bus that I booked before. Drank a chuhai and passed out for most of the ride. The town was cute and I loved my lodge called Guest House Japan! I'm so glad they had availability and were affordable, highly rec. It's so homey and the large tub is really relaxing once you accept that you're sharing it with everyone else. The owners spoke great English and drove me to/from the bus station among many other kind gestures.

Day 7: Attempted some snowboarding. Lift tickets could be purchased on site and there were lots of rental shops, so I didn't have any issues with reserving last minute. Finding restaurants with open spaces for dinner was impossible though, which I guess is the norm in resort areas. I didn't mind eating on the mountain or having konbini meals.

Day 8: More snowboarding, more konbini meals. The lodge included a wholesome breakfast with juice, coffee, bacon, scrambled eggs, toast, fruit, and a yogurt cup.

Day 9: Tiny bit more snowboarding, then headed back to Tokyo. It was snowing a bit throughout but mostly pretty icy and I was banged up by this point.

Day 10: Crazed last day of shopping. Went to a fancy yakiniku spot for my last dinner and had tons of wagyu.

Day 11: Flight back home!

You know that feeling when you're deep in code and suddenly get bombarded with 20+ PRs to review, each needing documentation updates? 
Yeah, that was my every Monday morning nightmare.

Spent last weekend building an AI assistant that:

Checks PR quality before it hits my inbox
Auto-generates documentation updates
Flags potential issues in the code
Updates our API docs
Sends actually helpful feedback to junior devs

The results are pretty sweet:

PR review time: 45 mins ‚Üí 12 mins
Documentation is actually up to date (shocking, I know)
Junior devs get feedback faster
I can finally focus on actual coding
My coffee is hot again (because I can drink it before it gets cold)

Favorite moment: One of our juniors asked who the really detailed senior dev was that kept helping them. It was the AI all along lol

Stack I used:
GPT4o for code review
LangGraph for workflow
MemGPT for context
Pinecone for storing best practices

1gyeya5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gyeya5/i_work_as_a_security_guard_in_a_secret_government/,"I work as a security guard in a secret government facility, and this is what happened (Part 1) ","Buster growled softly, baring his teeth at me as he stood in defiance. His stance rigid and unyielding, his tail stiff, and ears pinned back - he watched my every move with alert eyes.

My 3-year-old German shepherd had intuitively figured out the prospect of an upcoming bath when he saw me reach for the towel, and decided to give me a hard time over it.

‚ÄúI know buddy. I am not happy about it either. But I will make it quick. I promise,‚Äù I tried to reason, holding up both hands to reassure him.

‚ÄòBut it‚Äôs not even been a week‚Ä¶‚Äô I could almost imagine him saying those exact words to me when he growled back in protest.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right...But listen, man. You‚Äôre dirty. I can feel your presence from here,‚Äù I said, standing ten feet away and pretending to cover my nostrils with my finger.

Buster, of course, didn‚Äôt care and continued to defy without hesitation.

I put my hands on my hip and sighed. My glance immediately shifted to a hose attached to a tap outside my quarters.

‚ÄúTell you what. I‚Äôll make it worth your while. You don‚Äôt mind the jet spray, right? In fact, you even tolerate it sometimes,‚Äù I said, pointing to the hose located only a few feet away.

‚ÄúHow about a little cooperation now, and I‚Äôll make you your favorite meal a little later?‚Äù I asked him, while reaching out to pick a can of chicken liver from the kitchen.

As I dangled the can in my hand, I could see it slowly chipping away at his resolve, his mind grappling with the pros and cons of my new proposal.

A moment later, Buster barked at me twice and slowly made his way out of the house. He sat by the garden tap, ready to receive his bath.¬†

I took a handful of lotion and began to rub it against his torso to remove all the muck and grime that was sticking to his body.¬† We had been quite busy lately, guarding the base and conducting multiple patrols along the perimeter every day. The rain a few hours ago certainly didn't help matters, with Buster leaping over puddles of water and actively rolling in the mud to escape the desert heat. I had to use a brush to remove the layers of dirt that had caked all over his body.

It‚Äôs been a strange week, to say the least. The days were busy but peaceful, while the nights brought scattered, random sounds. Their origins were a mystery, as they appeared not to originate from the base. But I wasn‚Äôt too worried about it, not yet anyway.

There is an air base located a couple of hours away from the facility, and it wasn‚Äôt unusual for them to conduct sorties at odd hours in the night. I assumed they were probably testing out some new technology. ¬†

My colleague Joe thought the same thing as well. But we couldn‚Äôt take any chances, and we both had a job to do. So we conducted regular patrols around the base just as a precautionary measure.

But deep down, I felt something nagging at me, like I was being watched by someone or something. I couldn‚Äôt exactly put it into words.

For a second, I wondered if Buster too felt the same way when I saw him suddenly lift his head up, listening intently with his ears up in attention.

I quickly turned back to check if there was anybody standing behind me, but I found no one. When I turned around to face him again, I saw him looking up at the night sky, his gaze focused and unwavering. ¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it buddy? You see something?‚Äù I asked him as I cleared away the foam from his face. Moments went by slowly. And then, just like that, as if nothing had happened, he put his head down and began pawing my leg, urging me to finish his bath. I sighed again and turned on the hose, to wash off all the soap.

He finally looked presentable and I have to admit, his coat glistened beautifully under the moonlight.

Before I could reach for his towel, Buster swiftly moved in to close the gap between us and looked me in the eye dead serious. He then shook his body vigorously, much like a wet dog trying to rid itself of wetness, and trotted off without bothering to look back.

I laughed out loud as I sat there, drenched in water. I knew I should have seen that coming. However, my smile quickly faded, as it also reminded me of Jessica, my ailing wife.

Before another thought could take shape in my mind, I heard a familiar voice blare across the radio.

‚ÄúMike, I need you down here. Get to the post quick.‚Äù

It was my colleague Joe and I replied back in the affirmative. I quickly grabbed my gear and signaled Buster to follow after me.

When I reached the post, I saw Joe standing there armed with his rifle. As a seasoned war veteran with two tours under his belt, Joe was a dangerous man and not to be trifled with. But he was also compassionate and wise beyond his years.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up Joe?‚Äù I inquired, as I approached him near the entrance of the base.

‚ÄúI am not sure yet.¬† I thought I heard something at a distance. It could well be nothing.‚Äù he replied, after a brief pause.

‚ÄòWell, we‚Äôve had a lot of that going around all week‚Äô, I thought to myself.

He then turned around to look at me. ‚ÄúI want you to run a perimeter sweep first. Then go on patrol again. Take Buster with you‚Äù he said, before heading back to his post.

I started the jeep and drove out towards the perimeter. The engine hummed softly as I navigated the rough terrain, with Buster sitting alertly beside me. After finding nothing suspicious during my initial sweep, I decided to broaden my search radius.

A mile into the drive, Buster suddenly started barking, prompting me to stop the jeep immediately. He leaped onto the ground and dashed towards a boulder located a short distance away. I picked up my rifle and cautiously followed after him.

When I reached the spot, I keyed the mic attached to my shirt and said, ""Boss, you need to come see this.""

I knew he wasn‚Äôt going to be happy about leaving the guard post unmanned, but I thought he would prefer to come and inspect this himself.

Joe arrived ten minutes later, parking his vehicle next to mine. He walked towards the boulder overlooking a small pond, and switched on his torch to get a better look at the skeletal remains of an animal dumped nearby. Three other animal remains lay next to it, all appearing to be in a similar condition.

‚ÄúThese look like coyotes, probably stopping by to drink water from the pond before they were killed,‚Äù he observed, his voice expressing concern. ‚ÄúDid you find them like this?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes‚Äù, I replied. ‚ÄúAnd they weren‚Äôt here when I drove through the same place this morning. I thought it was quite odd to be honest, to find four of them out here all at once in the middle of the desert, that too at this hour.‚Äù

Joe simply nodded in agreement.

‚ÄúWhat sort of creature do you think did this Joe?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean it must have a ravenous appetite to chew every sinew of flesh from the bone, and lick it this clean.‚Äù I said, leaning in take another look.

‚ÄúDo you think it could be the Chupacabra or something similar?‚Äù I continued, knowing fully well my question was a bit far-fetched, but I had to still get it off my chest.

Joe finally stood up, switched off his torch, and looked around the vast open desert in quiet contemplation.

‚ÄúThis is in fact the fifth sighting in less than a week, Mike, and all have occurred in close proximity to secure government installations. The one before this was even stranger, and happened near a military base, where an old buddy of mine continues to serve.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe told me in that instance, the remains belonged to a dog. There were no signs of flesh or connecting tissue from the nasal region to the abdominal section, while the region spanning from the abdominal cavity to the tail bone was left fully intact. The whole thing was carried out with surgical precision, and drew morbid praise from even the medic back at the base.‚Äù

""But how is that even possible? What are you suggesting, Joe?"" I asked, surprised by the tone of my own voice and my inability to hide my disappointment upon hearing about it for the first time.

‚ÄúThis is not a hunt for prey, Mike. This is a hunt for attention. Somebody is trying to make a point. And I‚Äôd say they are accomplishing their objective.‚Äù Joe said.

When we got back to the base, Joe updated the command centre about the new developments. I headed back to my quarters and lay down on my bed. The exhaustion washed over me and I immediately drifted to sleep.

*I looked at my Mickey Mouse watch. The time was 5:36 PM. I was licking my ice cream while sitting next to my mom in the car. To my right, was my 4 year old cousin Henry who was fast asleep on his mother‚Äôs lap.*

*In the front, my dad was driving the car with his brother seated next to him. Then a truck from the opposite side suddenly came in our lane, and rammed into our vehicle causing it to turn turtle.*

*With great difficulty, I managed to extricate myself and pulled my cousin out from the wreckage as well. And then suddenly, the car exploded and went up in flames‚Ä¶.*

I opened my eyes and realized I was still in bed. The same dream had come and gone a thousand times before. It has become a constant part of my life ever since I was a 9-year-old kid.

I slowly got off the bed and found my head hurting. I had barely slept since last night‚Äôs excitement, and my mood was already beginning to turn foul.

Buster was already awake. I gently patted him on the head as I walked into the kitchen to put a kettle of water on the boil, and turned on the TV.

My attention immediately shifted towards the news. There was a nuclear explosion in Russia in a small town that was just a couple of hours away from Moscow. The details regarding the explosion were still shrouded in speculation.

‚ÄúJust the kind of news to start the day,‚ÄùI groaned as I reached for a nearby chair in the kitchen.

‚ÄòBut what could have caused this?‚Äô I thought to myself a little later, and hoped the damage there was minimal.

I then looked at the clock and set about getting ready for work. I showered, ate my breakfast, and was out the door by 8, with a hot cup of coffee in hand. Buster raced ahead to get to the guard post.

Joe had already completed his shift, and was waiting for me to relieve him of his duties. We high-fived as usual, and he began to walk back to his quarters. I settled into my chair, and made an entry in the logbook.

My name is Michael Armesto, a 30-year-old security guard working for a secret government installation located in an obscure area in the hot Nevada desert. The facility is centered around a medium-sized building occupying 7,000 square feet of space.

A 10-meter-high wired fence had been erected around the base to provide added protection. There was nothing else around the facility for miles, with the exception of a few boulder fields and mountains in the distance.

For over 5 years now, my colleague Joe and I have been working in shifts to ensure the guard post is manned at all times. When compared to other secret government bases, the security requirements here are not as stringent. And yet, neither Joe nor I ever had any clue about the kind of work being done here.

Every day, like clockwork, a bus carrying 25 people would arrive at the facility at 9:00 AM sharp. I had to open the gates to let them through, once the customary security checks were performed.

These people always wore lab coats and looked like scientists. They would work in the facility until 5:00 PM, and leave by the same bus at the end of the day. In all that time, they never once smiled or waved at me. It was as if their bosses had strictly informed them to not even initiate eye contact with people outside their circle.

Anyway, I never took offense to any of that. My job was to provide security to the facility, and I was doing that to the best of my ability.

As I sat back in my chair, ready to take another sip of coffee, my phone began to ring. It was from the hospital, and I answered it. A minute later, I called Joe and asked him to stand in for me. He immediately understood.

When he arrived at the guard post, I apologized for the inconvenience and Joe simply nodded with a reassuring smile.

As I was about to climb into my jeep, I pointed my finger at Buster and said, ‚ÄúSTAY.‚Äù.

‚ÄúTake him with you Mike. She will be happy to see him‚Äù Joe said quickly intervening.

‚ÄúBut Boss, I don‚Äôt want to leave you here alone after last night.‚Äù I protested.

Joe waved his hand dismissively. ‚ÄúGet going Mike. That‚Äôs an order.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt worry about me. I‚Äôll be fine. Go see Jess and tell her I am rooting for her,‚Äù he said, before walking back to the guard post.

I put a leash on Buster and climbed into the jeep with him. I started the vehicle and began driving towards the city to check on my wife Jessica. She was receiving treatment for lung cancer at St Mary‚Äôs Hospital, which was a 5 hour drive from the base.

Jess had never smoked once in her life, and for her to go through all this hardship really broke my heart. I would have normally liked to stay by her side during this crisis, but I could not afford the cost of treatment on my own. Thankfully, the insurance from my government job so far helped me cover most of the medical expenses.

After arriving at the hospital, I headed straight to her room and found her with tubes attached to her mouth. She was heavily sedated and looked like she was in pain.

Buster was standing by the door looking glum. He could see that Jess was unwell. Buster came into my life as a surprise birthday gift from Jess, and he has been a part of our family ever since. The people working at the hospital regularly allowed him inside the premises, knowing fully well that his presence always helped to uplift her spirits.

I came to know from the doctor that Jess had suffered a heart attack due to long term COVID complications. While she was stable and out of danger for now, she did need to undergo an emergency surgery within the next 3 days. The surgery alone would cost $30,000, and that was not covered by my insurance policy.

I pulled Buster by the leash to tell him it was time to go, but he kept resisting. He wanted to sit by her side for some time, even though she was unconscious and unable to acknowledge his presence. So, I too pulled up a chair and sat beside him. It immediately brought back happy memories of our marriage.

We used to spend our summers going on long drives, visiting natural parks, or idly sitting by the beach, enjoying good food and playing all kinds of sports. Jess and I would also often embark on scenic routes, with no particular destination in mind, allowing the road to guide us towards hidden gems.

Whether it's a visit to a historic village or a hike through a lush green forest, all the shared experiences helped strengthen our bond as a family.

The two of us also enjoyed using Buster to pull pranks on each other. Whenever Jess gave him a bath, she would command Buster to go ‚ÄòShake‚Äô in front of me and I would get drenched in water, leading to fits of laughter all around. It was one of her favorite pranks.

So when I saw my wife on the bed with tubes attached to her mouth, I got the reality check I needed. I stood up from my chair and yanked harder at his leash; he didn‚Äôt resist this time and followed after me.

I walked out of the hospital feeling a bit dazed. As I started to drive back to the base, my mind was busy trying to come up with solutions. I had only $2000 in my bank account, and that clearly wasn‚Äôt enough.

‚ÄòMaybe I could contact an official from the government and apply for a loan?‚Äô I thought to myself. I kept driving while mulling on the best course of action.

Then, at a certain point, I suddenly snapped to my senses and immediately stopped the car. I had been driving for over 4 hours now. It was 7 in the evening, and night had already fallen.

Yet, I could not spot the base in the distance. Usually, by this time, the floodlights would have been turned on, and the facility would be easily visible for miles.

Instead, all I could see up ahead was pitch-black darkness. Something was wrong.

I tried calling Joe on his phone, but he was unreachable. I pressed the gas pedal and drove as fast as I could.

When I finally reached the facility, the situation looked much worse than I had feared. The entrance gate was left half open, with no one manning the guard post. The entire building just sat there in the darkness with no power. I tried calling on Joe‚Äôs number again. No response.

I then called Joe‚Äôs boss, who was stationed in Carson City, to inform him of the situation and possibly request reinforcements. He was unreachable as well.

‚ÄòWhat on earth is going on?‚Äô I asked myself. This was completely bewildering on so many levels.

I slowly drove up to the base, and stopped the jeep a short distance away from the front gate. I wanted to be able to make a quick exit, if things turned hostile. I took a torch light from the dashboard and unfastened my sidearm from the holster. After getting down from the vehicle, I softly whistled towards Buster to follow me.

When I walked past the gate and checked the guard post, I saw a body lying face down on the floor. From a distance, it was difficult to identify the person clearly, but as I got closer I recognized Joe‚Äôs uniform. I ran towards him and turned him around and got the shock of my life. I stumbled back in fear and hit the floor hard.

I don‚Äôt know what they did to Joe.

But he was lying there dead! Very dead!

It was like he had been zapped or electrocuted. The only thing that was remaining of him was his skeleton. Not an ounce of flesh was visible on his body. And yet his uniform looked in pristine condition.

‚ÄòHow is this even possible?‚Äô I asked myself.

It immediately reminded me of the dead coyotes I found on patrol the previous night.

‚ÄúCould this all be somehow related? Was this an execution? And was this carried out be the same group of people?‚Äù I wondered.

Joe‚Äôs rifle was still there, leaning against the wall. I holstered my sidearm and picked up his rifle. I checked the magazine. He hadn‚Äôt fired a single shot.

I then turned on the tactical light and started moving towards the government facility. No one could enter this building until they had a high level of clearance, and every person who had clearance, was issued an electronic key card to gain access. So I was shocked to see the door was left ajar here as well.

Before entering, I headed back to check the junction box. The darkness was making me paranoid and I wanted to see if there was anything I could do to fix it first. When I reached the box, I discovered that the power had been deliberately shut down.

I turned it back on, and the entire place lit up like a Christmas tree.

But the whole facility wore a deserted look. The bus that was usually used to ferry the scientists was still parked at the parking lot.

I doubled back towards the entrance, and slowly entered the building with my rifle pointed forward. This was the first time I was setting foot inside the facility. And if this was supposed to be a top research lab, I wasn‚Äôt seeing any signs of it.

The place had been hastily evacuated. There was not a single soul in sight. All I could see was waste paper and computer cables strewn across the floor. Everything else had been cleared out.

Buster then took off on his own, and dashed towards the far end of the building. Something had caught his fancy and I followed after him. He stopped against a large couch and started barking at me.

I looked down and could see something metallic hidden underneath. I stretched my hand to retrieve an aluminum briefcase with blood stains all over it. Someone was obviously holding onto it for dear life, and then tossed it underneath as a last ditch attempt to prevent it from getting into the wrong hands.

‚ÄòDid the scientists manage to escape? Or did something bad happen to them, like it happened to Joe?‚Äô

‚ÄòCould the nuclear explosion in Russia have something to do with this?‚Äô

‚ÄúAre the two countries about to go to war? Is this to be viewed as an escalation,‚Äù I wondered.

A hundred questions were going through my mind now, and I had answers to none of them.

I decided to get the hell out of there as quickly as possible. I saw no point in staying, now that Joe was dead and the facility had also been cleared out. I ran back to my jeep, tossed the briefcase in the backseat, and began my drive back to the nearest city I could think of.

Twenty minutes into the drive, I began to get curious about the briefcase, and I had to stop the car to take a look. I switched on the light in my vehicle and opened the briefcase. There was some kind of a telescope inside.

On its base, it bore the insignia of a bright burning Sun with a single eye at it‚Äôs center. It also had a name tag attached to it that was labelled Korelo ZX4 ‚Äì 1969.

The telescope in itself was a strange looking contraption, the likes of which I had never seen before. It was the size of a camcorder, and comfortably fit within the palm of my hand.

There were two identical knobs on either side of the device. The one on the left moved freely clockwise or counter clockwise. It felt similar to those old radio transistors, where you could switch back and forth between stations.

The knob on the right looked the same but had a small pointer attached to it. It had limited range of motion and worked like a switch. Close to the pointer were 3 printed dots, one larger than the other in ascending order. I guess this signified the 3 levels in which this device functioned.

I held the telescope gently in my hand and peered into the eyepiece. With the moon being the only source of light in the desert, I could hardly spot a thing. I then turned the knob on the right, and the device immediately roared to life. I could even feel it mildly vibrating in my hand.

As I peered into the eyepiece again, I now had clear vision of the space all around me. A green display had opened up and was providing clean imagery with stunning levels of detail. I slowly started to turn the knob on the left, and the telescope began to zoom in and out.

I could now clearly see the creatures of the desert ‚Ä¶.miles away‚Ä¶ coming out their holes ‚Ä¶looking for prey. Their heat signatures capturing perfectly‚Ä¶ the contours of their own bodies as they moved swiftly across the sand.

As I kept zooming in further, I could also spot the local diner of the nearest town that was more than 50 miles away. I could not only figure out the make and model of cars parked in front of the restaurant, but also read the number plates on them.

And then I looked upwards, pointing the telescope at the night sky, hoping to see the stars a little more clearly. And suddenly everything became obscure. It was like staring at a blank wall.

I moved the telescope away looking confused. Everything looked normal. There was an abundance of stars scattered across the sky, and there were hardly any clouds. I looked into the telescope again, and started zooming back, and my heart suddenly skipped a beat.

Thousands of feet high up in the sky, a large spaceship was hovering mid-air. It was big enough to accommodate an entire football field. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I just kept staring at it for several moments.

Then I slowly began to pan the telescope across the skyline, and soon realized that I was in for an even bigger shock! There were at least two more spaceships thousands of miles away. Make no mistake. They were clearly visible as the one I was standing in front of.

‚ÄòOk Mike, What else you got?‚Äô I said out loud to myself.

I then turned my focus back to the ship in front of me, and turned the right knob again.

The second dot got highlighted on screen, and the telescope suddenly zoomed in to reveal the insides of the spaceship.

The unfolding images were a little grainy but still definitive enough to provide sufficient visual quality. It was like an X-ray, CT scan and MRI all rolled into one. As I kept adjusting the left knob to get a clearer visual, I could see a large workstation occupying most of the space inside the ship.

Close to the panel, two people were standing and conversing with each other. They did not look human at all. In fact, they looked like aliens!

By this point, I was already sweating even as the cool winds of the desert were hitting my face, and ruffling my hair. I continued to stare into the telescope completely transfixed. I turned the right knob one more time.

The last big dot got highlighted on screen, and then I suddenly started hearing weird noises. Buster who was keeping silent all this while, let out a soft howl and dug his face into the sand. But the noises didn‚Äôt stop. It sounded odd and animal like. Like the garbled speech of someone attempting to speak with a mouthful of water. I realized I was now eavesdropping on the aliens talking amongst themselves.

I think they figured this out as well. Because one of them abruptly stopped speaking, and walked towards a work station, and then punched something on the console.

In a matter of moments, the other alien turned around and took a step forward in my direction. It looked like he was peering down at me, fully aware of my existence. A wry smile appeared on his lips, and I felt a shiver go down my spine.

I immediately switched off the telescope, put it back in the briefcase and ran towards my jeep. Buster followed after me. I decided to get to the nearest town and drove as fast as I could.",19,1732410189.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

1gyewj4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gyewj4,Thickened cream layer efficiency ,"Hi all, gotten into coming up with cocktails recently and I‚Äôve ended up making a lot of the seasonal specials at the pub I work at. 
For Christmas we're having a tirimasu cocktail that has a thickened chocolate cream on top - floated a bit like an Irish coffee.
Wondering if anyone has suggestions on getting this to work with an ISI gun? Had a go earlier with a cartridge that was waaaay too strong (22g instead of 8g) and ended up with a very overwhipped, solid cream. 
Is it possible to use an ISI gun to get something more similar to a smooth, thickened layer you'd get just from lightly shaking the cream?
Seems to me if it is then this might be much more efficient if we end up making a lot in one go.
I've added pictures of what it's *supposed* to look like achieved by shaking the cream until thickened, and one of the (not total disaster) of the very overwhipped cream. 
Thanks for taking the time.
TL/DR: thickened yet 'runny cream' as opposed to solid whipped with an ISI gun?",2,1732410047.0,cocktails,0,0.75,False

1gyev9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gyev9u/my_manager_treats_me_like_im_mentally_disabled/,My manager treats me like I‚Äôm mentally disabled ,"Firstly I want to apologise for the phrasing in the title, I‚Äôm really not sure of the best way to explain how she‚Äôs treating me and that was the only way that came to mind. If anyone has a better phrasing to use I‚Äôm all ears!

I (F32) started working at a small local caf√© recently after 16 years in retail.

Everyone treated me ‚Äúnormally‚Äù (for lack of a better phrase) except for my manager, for the purpose of this post we‚Äôll call her Diane.
I have no idea why, but she treats me like I‚Äôm learning disabled.

For a bit of background, I worked at a big retailer from the age of 16 until earlier this year when I asked for time off to look after my son (he had an operation and was unable to walk) and they denied my request due to staff shortages. My son comes first so I made the decision to leave. 

I am by no means stupid - I worked my way up in the retailer to department manager (I know that doesn‚Äôt necessarily take brains but still) I got good GCSEs, and started at university but I struggled with being a single parent, working and studying so that‚Äôs gone on the back burner. 

What I am, is extremely anxious. My mental health has been particularly poor recently due to many things - my mum has been getting gradually more poorly over the last year and has been hospitalised numerous times and I‚Äôm trying to care for her, and for my son who is still recovering from his operation, as well as learning that I may have a genetic condition that predisposes me to many different types of cancer. Point is, it‚Äôs been a rough year. 

I started this job as a stop-gap while I try to find something a bit more permanent that works around my son and my mum. I had been warned about the culture of this particular place but beggars can‚Äôt be choosers. 

 Since starting, Diane has been gradually more and more awful to me. Some examples are-

- after just over 3 weeks there, with next to no training, she announced to the whole kitchen that I was bad at numerous things and I need to fix them. I‚Äôd like to point out that all these things that I was bad at also weren‚Äôt being done by my direct line manager or most of the other members of staff either, but no one else got a dressing down.
- while at the cafe wrapping cutlery, she slapped my arm and pointed to a customer that had literally that very second out down their cutlery and finished eating so I could clear their table.
- she asked a 16yo member of staff to get me (whilst I was making coffee for customers) so she could show me how to stack tins of beans on a shelf (I WORKED IN RETAIL FOR 16 YEARS)
- she guided me to the sink to show me how she put the cutlery in a plastic tub so they don‚Äôt all go to the bottom of the sink, why that‚Äôs an issue I don‚Äôt know.
- she shouted at me for sighing in front of all the customers in the caf√© AND the kitchen staff (it was extremely busy, we were short staffed and I was getting overwhelmed. Sighing helps me to regulate. 
- she ‚Äúhelped‚Äù in the cafe (she‚Äôs usually in the kitchen) and lost some tickets, so customers didn‚Äôt get their drinks and started to complain. That was my fault of course. 
- we aren‚Äôt given breaks. I‚Äôm lucky if I get a couple of minutes to have a vape.

There are more things but those are what I can remember off the top of my head. 

Another 16yo colleague noticed the difference in the way she treats me compared to her and my other colleagues. 

The only reasons I can think of as to why she would be treating me like this is that I am 1) fat, and 2) she genuinely believe I‚Äôm not all there up there. 

There‚Äôs no point to this really, I just needed to vent about things because it‚Äôs shit and I‚Äôm sad. It was long so if you made it this far, thank you for reading.",1,1732409948.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False
