I wasn't even supposed to be there. He only invited me because our mom guilted him into it, and I only went because she bought me the damn gift to give him. But his girlfriend Emma started the whole thing by asking me super pointed questions about why I ""didn't like her"" and if I thought she ""wasn't good enough"" for my brother.

I had no idea what she was talking about. I barely knew her. They'd been dating maybe four months and I'd met her twice.

""I don't have a problem with you,"" I said. ""I barely know you.""

She got this look on her face like I'd just confirmed something. ""That's exactly what he said you'd say.""

My brother jumped in real quick. ""Babe, not here, okay?""

But she kept going. ""He told me you've always been weird about his girlfriends. That you get jealous when he's in a relationship because you're used to having all his attention.""

I actually laughed because it was so fucking ridiculous. ""I live three hours away. We talk maybe once a month.""

""See?"" My brother put his hand on her arm. ""This is what I mean. She gets defensive.""

That's when I realized what he'd done. Two weeks ago I'd asked him point blank if he was still talking to his ex, because I'd run into her at a coffee shop and she'd made some weird comment about ""working things out."" He'd sworn up and down he wasn't. Then last week our cousin told me she saw them having dinner together. When I confronted him about it, he said I was being paranoid and needed to stop believing gossip.

He'd spun the whole thing to Emma like I was some obsessive sister who couldn't let him have his own life.

""I'm not defensive,"" I said. ""I'm confused. What exactly did he tell you I did?""

Emma looked at my brother, then back at me. ""That you keep accusing him of cheating on me. That you make up stories about seeing him with other girls. That you've done this with all his girlfriends and it's why most of his relationships don't work out.""

The table got quiet. Our mom was staring at her plate.

I pulled out my phone. ""Is that what he said.""

My brother's face went white. ""Don't.""

""Don't what?"" I opened my messages. ""Don't show her the texts from two weeks ago where you literally begged your ex to meet up? Or the ones from last month where you told her Emma was 'temporary'?""

Emma grabbed my phone before he could stop her. I watched her face change as she scrolled. She read out loud, and her voice cracked on the words. ""I miss you so much. She's not you. I'm trying to move on but I can't stop thinking about you."" She looked up at him. ""You sent this three weeks ago.""

""Baby, let me explain-""

""There's more,"" I said. I wasn't even trying to be cruel. I was just so fucking done with his bullshit. ""Keep scrolling.""

She did. Her hands were shaking. ""You told her you loved her. Last week. While we were at your parents' house for Sunday dinner.""

My brother stood up. ""This is exactly what I'm talking about. She's obsessed with ruining my relationships.""

""By showing me screenshots of your own words?"" Emma's voice got loud enough that other tables looked over. ""You called me a rebound. You told her I was 'fine for now.'""

""You went through my phone!"" He was yelling now. ""You invaded my privacy!""

""I didn't go through anything,"" I said. ""Your ex sent these to me because she felt guilty about you lying to both of them. She thought Emma deserved to know.""

Emma stood up and threw her napkin on the table. Her eyes were red but she wasn't crying yet. ""We're done. Don't call me. Don't text me. Don't show up at my place.""

""Emma, please-"" He tried to grab her arm but she yanked away.

""Your sister was right about you the whole time and you made me think she was crazy."" She looked at me. ""I'm sorry. He showed me screenshots too, but they were all edited. He made it look like you were sending him paranoid messages.""

She left. Just walked right out of the restaurant.

My brother turned on me and I genuinely thought he might hit me. ""You're a fucking psycho. You know that? You can't stand seeing me happy.""

Our mom finally spoke up. ""That's enough. Sit down.""

""No."" He grabbed his jacket. ""I'm not staying here with her. This is my birthday and she ruined it.""

""You ruined it yourself,"" I said. ""I just showed her what you wrote.""

He called me a bitch and walked out. Left his entire birthday cake sitting there untouched. Our mom paid the bill in silence and we went home.

Here's the thing though. I keep replaying it and wondering if I should've just stayed quiet. Emma asked me direct questions and I answered them, but maybe I should've pulled her aside privately instead of doing it at the table in front of everyone. My brother's friends are blowing up my phone saying I humiliated him on his birthday over ""private relationship stuff"" and that I'm jealous he's moving on with his life.

My mom says I did the right thing but I can tell she's upset about how it went down. And now I'm wondering if I really did cross a line by showing those messages, even if they were true. Maybe it wasn't my place.

AITA?

I'll be visiting Gdansk/tri-cities with a couple friends in May for a little Northern Poland trip. We'll probably be there around 5 days or so, and then head to Torun and Poznan for a few days as well.

We're football fans, so we hope to see Lechia Gdansk as I see they have a home game that weekend we'll be in the city.

I wander through Toronto with a backpack that’s basically my whole life. Hitting up dispensaries with my shelter buddy, still working on that friend promotion but shes my buddy at heart.

 

We took over the city, holding on to the last bit of sanity we at during these times, with some frequent sightseeing and wholesome conversations.  In the middle of all this I tireless tell myself “I got this” while also asking myself “what the actual hell am I doing?”. One day I feel energized and happy  going the gym, next I’m having midnight strolls to McDonald’s for a sweet treat.

 

Though it all seems like fun and games until the role you play in society really hits your reality. Walking into the shelter home on the streets of King West, not too far from the finance district, with people watching you. Falling asleep on a mat, escaping into exciting vivid dreams only to wake up to the same mat you fell asleep in not later than 7 in the morning. Shamelessly waiting in line for bread, boiled eggs, and butter to get through the morning. But nothing cheered me up like a my first cup of coffee in the morning, regardless of where I was. Even when you hit rock bottom, I learned that its important to keep yourself happy and make the most of what you have. Improvising what’s given to make each day a little better. Though I had a generous amount of space in the shelter along with internet to get the work I need to get done, yet not matter where you go, peace and quiet seems to be hard to find, unless your dead. A lot of the peers I shared the space with were suffering from mental health disorders and withdrawal symptoms, so it was hard gathering my thoughts together. There are times where I’d be interrupted by loud banging noises, arguments, yet even when they were resolved and those involved with dealt with, their presence was still terribly missed.",2,1769205524.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

I’ll be completely honest — I used to look at adult coloring books and think, *“Cute, but not for me.”* Then one late night, after juggling work stress, endless notifications, and the quiet hum of burnout, I downloaded a small **coloring book adult PDF** just to see what the hype was about.  

What I found wasn’t just pretty patterns. It was peace.  
Ten minutes into coloring, my brain finally *shut up.* I wasn’t thinking about my inbox or my next deadline. I was just following color, shape, rhythm. And for a tiny fraction of time — I felt calm, creative, and grounded again.  

Here’s what I’ve learned (and why you should try it too):  
• Coloring can shift your focus from overthinking to mindfulness — like meditation, but without the pressure.  
• It triggers the same relaxation response as yoga or deep breathing.  
• Finishing even one page brings a sense of control and accomplishment on days when nothing else feels “done.”  

After seeing the difference it made in my day-to-day stress, I decided to turn that calm into something shareable — a PDF-packed **adult coloring book** you can download and use anytime you need a reset. 🎨  

👉 Get your free download here: [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)  

It includes intricate nature-inspired patterns, geometric designs, and peaceful scenes that quietly invite your brain to slow down. Whether you use it in the morning with coffee, after work with tea, or on a flight to unplug, it’s created to help you reconnect with stillness.  

That’s really the heart of it — slowing down isn’t a luxury anymore, it’s survival. We weren’t built to be “on” all the time. Color lets us step back into simplicity — one stroke at a time.

And if it helps even one person breathe deeper today, I’ll count that as a win. 🌿

Coca tea has been used for a long time by people in the high Andes to help deal with altitude sickness. Called mate de coca, it’s made from coca leaves, which are important in South American cultures. While coca leaves are linked to cocaine, coca tea itself is mild and traditional, with some known benefits for altitude sickness.



Altitude sickness causes headaches, tiredness, short breath and nausea. Coca tea is said to help with these by stimulating breathing, helping the body use oxygen better, and giving more energy. It also might improve blood flow and reduce appetite, which helps keep energy up at high altitudes. Travelers in places like Cusco and La Paz often get coca tea and say it helps with dizziness and headaches. Science is mixed about how well it works but drinking it moderately seems safe.



Besides altitude sickness coca tea is used for tiredness and stomach problems. It’s a mild stimulant like coffee but gentler, giving alertness without feeling jittery. The leaves also have calcium, phosphorus, and vitamins B1 B2 and C, adding some nutrition. It’s also used to calm the stomach and help with indigestion or bloating, which can be helpful when adjusting to new food and water.



Coca tea is legal in several South American countries and easy to find in hotels and markets but alkaloids in it can show up on drug tests as cocaine. Even though the amount is tiny and not psychoactive, travelers should check rules if returning to countries with strict laws.



Overall coca tea is not a cure but it’s a common mountain drink that helps locals and visitors deal with the tough conditions of high altitude with some nutrition and mild stimulation.",1,1769205264.0,u_trundless,0,1.0,False

1ql443l,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1ql443l/the_glp1_effect_how_weight_loss_drugs_are/,The GLP-1 Effect: How Weight Loss Drugs are Reshaping Food and Pharma,"As GLP-1 weight-loss drugs have moved from a niche treatment to a mainstream prescription, their impact is starting to show up well beyond pharmacies, as they've quietly reconfigured supply chains stretching from drug manufacturing and cold-chain logistics, to grocery shelves and food production lines. That's because the drugs don't simply facilitate weight-loss; they have also been found to profoundly change patients' eating habits. 

The trend is significant. In a fall 2025 survey of 1,350 U.S. adults [by the Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-health-tracking-poll-prescription-drug-costs-views-on-trump-administration-actions-and-glp-1-use/#6e97caa0-c050-48f0-bf0d-8ef85bba1431) (KFF), roughly one in every eight people reported taking a GLP-1 drug. Of that share, 38% said that they use the drug to treat a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease, while 32% use it to treat a chronic condition and lose weight, and 30% use it solely to lose weight. 

As the drug has exploded in popularity, food manufacturers have been forced to rethink their demand planning, grocery stores have had to adjust their offerings and portion sizes, and pharmaceutical companies have raced to add cold chain capacity and manufacturing throughput to keep pace.

""The impacts are so far reaching,"" says Tiffany Brewer, senior director of global industry strategy at supply chain management provider [Blue Yonder](https://blueyonder.com/). 

Unlike other medications that might target a singular health issue for a limited period of time, GLP-1 drugs can drive sustained, long-term changes in how people eat, shop and manage their health, given that the medication acts as an appetite suppressant, and helps maintain muscle mass while promoting weight loss. That means maintaining a high-protein diet to support weight loss and muscle-building, and more fresh fruits and vegetables to help with hydration, given that the medication can also block thirst signals.

According to a study published [by the Journal of Market Research](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/12/ozempic-changing-foods-americans-buy?), households reduced grocery spending by an average of 5.3% within six months of a family member starting a GLP-1 medication, while spending at fast food restaurants, coffee shops, and other so-called ""limited-service"" eateries fell by roughly 8%. Spending on savory snacks also dipped by 10%, with similar declines seen in purchases of sweets, baked goods and cookies. At the same time, a small number of categories showed increases, including yogurt, fresh fruit, nutrition bars and meat snacks, as shoppers focused more on healthier or protein-rich options.

""As they're on these medications, people not only are less hungry, but they're actively trying to have a healthier lifestyle,"" Brewer explains. ""They're making new purchasing decisions based on their new body.""

To meet this demand, some of the world's largest food manufacturers that had previously been known for their wide array of snack foods and sweets have pivoted toward offerings that specifically target GLP-1 users. [ConAgra](https://www.conagrabrands.com/) — which owns Chef Boyardee, Marie Callender's, and Orville Redenbacher's — even added a ""GLP-1 friendly"" label to 26 of its ""Healthy Choice"" frozen meals [in December 2024](https://www.conagrabrands.com/news-room/news-conagra-brands-introduces-badges-on-select-healthy-choice-products-leading-consumers-to-glp-1-friendly-options-prn-122909), while [Nestle targeted GLP-1 users](https://www.nestle.com/media/news/vital-pursuit-brand-glp-1-weight-support) with the launch of its ""Vital Pursuit"" frozen meal brand in May 2024, and [online grocer Ocado](https://www.ocado.com/categories/everything-january/e18a2edd-2891-4bb7-9b08-095baf0db6d2?source=NAV_BAR) added an entire weight management section to its platform in January 2026.

In a February 2024 interview with Bloomberg, Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen — whose company manufactures Ozempic and Wegovy — even said that food companies [had been calling him](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/-scared-food-ceos-are-calling-ozempic-maker-novo-nordisk-for-advice) to voice fears over the impacts GLP-1 drugs have had on consumer spending. Walmart CEO John Furner [shared similar concerns in 2023](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/ozempic-drug-users-are-buying-less-food-walmart-says-rcna119000), when he pointed out that GLP-1s were making shoppers buy less food overall.

Deeper into their supply chains, companies have also looked at changes to how products are packaged, stocked and replenished at the warehouse level. 

""As eating habits shift, assortment strategies and pack architecture are being re-evaluated,"" says Emily Nicholls, VP of supply chain applications for business planning software provider [Anaplan](https://www.anaplan.com/). Food manufacturers have felt a growing pressure to introduce smaller packaging sizes and more protein-rich foods, Nicholls adds, which can complicate supply chain network designs and replenishment planning, and increase operational burdens in the middle of a period where tariffs, geopolitical disruptions and an uncertain global economy have made precision and responsiveness more essential than ever.

Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies have invested billions of dollars in expanding production lines, building new GLP-1 manufacturing facilities, and strengthening supply chain infrastructure. GLP-1 drugs also can't be transported like typical medications, and must be kept [at 35-46 degrees Fahrenheit](https://www.peltonshepherd.com/resources/industry-updates/cold-chain-shipping-for-glp1-drugs/) from warehouse to pharmacy in order to remain stable. That requirement has pushed manufacturers and distributors to expand refrigerated storage, and invest in temperature-controlled packaging and monitoring, with [consultancy firm Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-healthcare-cold-chain-third-party-logistics-market) expecting the healthcare cold chain 3PL market to grow from $45 billion in 2025 to $83 billion by 2033. 

Consumers have felt the financial pressure as well, with [out-of-pocket costs](https://swordhealth.com/articles/glp-1-costs-risks-side-effects?) for GLP-1 drugs in the U.S. averaging $900-$1,400 a month, and costs covered at least in part by insurance ranging anywhere between $25 and $300 monthly. In its survey, KFF also found that 56% of GLP-1 users found it difficult to afford the drug, even with health insurance, while 14% said that they had stopped using the medication altogether because of the cost. Those costs are becoming another variable for supply chain planners to contend with, as manufacturers and distributors try to assess how steady GLP-1 demand will be in the face of shifting insurance coverage plans, consumer affordability concerns, and uneven access to the drugs.

""Planning is further complicated by the nature of GLP-1s as a chronic therapy,"" Nicholls adds. ""Unlike a one-time surge, demand compounds over time as new patients start to layer on top of a growing base of ongoing users, making long-term capacity planning structurally more difficult.""

Already, GLP-1 drugs are forcing companies to adapt not just to a new product, but to a sustained shift in consumer behavior and healthcare demand that touches food and pharmaceutical supply chains simultaneously. For supply chain leaders, the challenge now is less about reacting to the initial surge, and more about building the flexibility needed to manage and plan around a trend that shows little sign of fading.

1ql43z5,https://i.redd.it/jdt7ajev66fg1.png,"In honor of Luna Snow's 8th Anniversary, I present, Snowstorm Chapter 7","**Chapter 7** 



I wake up to the sounds of someone singing. “I really wanna la-la-la-la-love you. I really wanna love…” 



The shower is on and I look at my phone, it’s about 7am. I look out the window to see it frosted over and the entire city covered in snow and ice chunks flowing down the Han River. There's a chef cooking breakfast, but other than that, the house is still asleep. 



*“I need a shower too.”* I get up and walk into the room, the bed is made and the blinds are up. I go over to my luggage and put the ring back into its hiding spot. *“It seems like she’s in a better mood. She’s gotta be if she’s singing right?”* I knock on the bathroom door. “Seol? Babe?”



“I’ll be out in a few minutes honey. I have some stuff I wanna talk to you about. If you need a shower then you can hop in after I’m out. Plus it’ll give me some time to get one of your Christmas presents ready.”



“Sounds exciting. How are you feeling this morning? I came in last night and found the empty bottle, but I left you alone because you were asleep and completely buried under the sheets. Are you not totally hungover?” 



“Oh you uh, saw that. I had a bad day yesterday is all, and no I’m not hungover because somehow you keep forgetting that while I don’t have a healing factor as potent as Logan or Wade, I do still have one.” 



“Yeah.. that’s right, sorry.” 



She walks out of the bathroom in a towel and motions for me to go take mine. She looks me dead in the eyes, “Don’t take too long, your Christmas gift is time sensitive, it’ll get bored if you make it wait.” 



“Interesting…”



…



I hop out of the shower and dry off, wrapping the towel around my waist, I brush my teeth for the morning before opening the bathroom door to find the room dark, the temperature cold, door hinges iced, and a piece of paper telling me to get in bed. *“Lord have mercy on my pelvis.”* I lie down and realize how much more comfortable an actual bed is compared to that couch. 



“Close your eyes.” 



I close them and hear movement all around me. I feel her hand on my shoulder and suddenly feel reinvigorated and fully awake. 



“Open your eyes.”



I glance up and stare deep into those beautiful brown and blue eyes. Her pupils fully dilated, her cheeks bright red, damp hair flowing down around my head as if blocking off the rest of the world, her lips dewy and smooth, her smile melting away any doubt I still had… 



“H-hi honey. Merry Christmas.” 



*“I don’t think it’s possible for me to ever be more in love than I am right now.”* I place my hand on her cheek and just keep looking into her almost sparkling eyes. “You look nervous, anything I can do to help?” 



She leans back and sits up and moves over beside me and lies down. 



“You look stunning baby.” 



She grabs my shoulder and yanks me up and over her. Placing one hand above her shoulder and the other in her hand. We make eye contact yet again and she looks as if she’s expecting me to say something. 



“I’m glad to see you’re better. I love you more than anything.”



“Come here.” She wraps her arms around my neck and pulls down until our lips meet. 



…



I wrap my arms around her and we lie there in silence for a while looking out the window at snow falling. *“Her company is the only thing I want, moments like these are the ones I’ll never forget.”* 



There’s a knock on the door. “Seol dear, breakfast is getting cold and I’d like you to eat.” 



“She’s right, you know, you haven’t eaten in forever.” 



“Yeah I know. 네, 할머니! We’ll be out in a minute.” She looks at me with an almost sad look on her face. “I don’t want this to end.” 



“Me either but I’m starving cmon babe.” I offer my hand. 



“Yeah…” 



She and I get dressed and follow the aroma of food.



Reed is in the living room drinking coffee. “Merry Christmas you two. How are you feeling this morning Luna?” 



“I’m doing a lot better now thank you.”



“I’m glad to hear that. There’s food in the kitchen. It has been far too long since your last meal and you must make your health a priority.” 



“Don’t worry I’ll make sure she eats.” 



… 



After a relatively quiet breakfast of eggs and bacon for me I go and sit down in the living room and look at the tree. I can’t help but think about what Seol’s grandma told me last night *“ ‘Stash that ring, now's not the time.’ “* Seol sits down in my lap and wraps my arms around her waist. Everyone else joins us shortly and there’s small talk going on but I can’t help but notice how awkward it feels, and apparently so does she.



“Okay people lets address the situation, the public is fully buying into the rumors and I am uncertain of what's going to happen with me and my career. My producer and record label have both temporarily suspended me for alleged breach of contract, but until they can prove I’m in a relationship they can’t fully fire me.” 



After a few grueling seconds of silence, her grandma looks up. “Could you maybe get a lawyer?” 



“That wouldn’t work, if in her contract she signed, it said that she was to remain single, then she did breach that contract and thus it is void. Doesn’t matter how restrictive the terms, if she signed it, it’s legally binding.” Reed explains.



She looks up at me “I mean yeah I signed it but I never thought that I would meet *you*.” 



Susan finally speaks up. “What’s even the point of putting something like that in a contract?”



“It makes the delusional and obsessive fans think that they have a chance with me somehow. So they usually end up spending more money or engaging more with my content. I don’t think encouraging that behavior is healthy but it does increase profits.”



I grab her hand “So what options does that leave you with?” 



…



Her face turns grim and her eyes water. “I either retire and probably get sued… or we break up. It’s in my contract, I looked.” She begins to cry silently. “They’ve given me until the end of January to make my decision.”



I don’t know what to think. *“I can’t lose her. I don’t want to live a life without her.”* I glance at Ms. Hee and it looks like she’s praying and Reed is lost in thought. 



“Luna, you’re going to get through this. You helped us beat not one but two Doctor Dooms.”



“I’d love to believe that Susie but I’m having to choose between my dream and the love of my life. I don’t want to have to make that choice.” She looks straight down while talking.   
  


I still haven’t fully processed everything but I make sure to let her know I care. “Seol, It’s not gonna come to that, I won’t allow it. We’ll find some other way. I love you too much to let them come between us.”



Reed finally looks up. “Luna, if I may, would I maybe be able to take a look at this contract along with a friend? He’s an expert in the field, one of New York's best lawyers.”



“The contract said I’m not allowed to share it with anyone other than an attorney.”



“You’ve already voided the contract, they aren’t keeping their end of the deal anymore, which means you also no longer have to. If we can find some legal loophole in the contract, you might have a case to make.” 



“It’s a long shot but it’s definitely at least worth checking out. Reed, should I go ahead and call him?” Susan pulls out her phone.



Seol’s grandma interjects. “How about everyone take a second to breathe, Today is Christmas day, No one is going to be doing anything drastic today. I also don’t think we should bother anyone in New York at this hour anyway. Seol, dear, I understand that you are scared, but right now, you are safe and surrounded by people who love and care about you. Let’s spend Christmas day together and first thing tomorrow the four of you will fly to New York.” 



“I like the way your grandma thinks. Luna, trust me, this is your best shot at getting to keep everything. What do you say?” Reed stretches his arm out and offers a handshake to Seol.



“I guess it’s worth a try.” She’s muttering, still looking at the ground. 



I shake Reed's hand instead and squeeze her. “Honey, I’m here with you as long as you want. I love you” I kiss her head and she finally looks up. 



“I love you more.” 

… 



“Goodbye Grandma, I wish my visit could have been longer.” She gives her Grandma a bear hug and walks up the steps onto the private plane. 



“Ms. Hee, I’m sorry I’ve done this to your granddaughter.”



“Young Man, this is not your fault, she chose to date you knowing it was against her contract. It’s clear to me now that you two love each other dearly, I’m leaving it up to your judgement as for when the time is right. Keep that ring on you, You’ve earned my blessing.” 



“Thank You. I won’t fuck this up, for everyones sake.”



“You’ll do fine. Take care of my granddaughter.” 



“Yes Ma’am.” 



…



A few hours into the flight I find Reed set up on a table with a printed out copy of Seol’s contract. “So, have you found anything?” 



“Unfortunately, no. There’s so much legal jargon and filler words in here that it’s hurting my head. They purposely make these as hard as possible to understand.”



“Smartest man alive finding some trouble eh?”



“I am a Scientist, Astronaut, Physicist, Engineer, Chemist, Astronomer, Professor, Mathematician, Quantum Researcher, literally anything in the field of science, I can do, I’m even a damn superhero. But I am unfortunately not well versed in law. Hence why I called for help. I just thought I’d do the best I can to help out a friend, even if it is outside of my area of expertise.” 



“Yeah I really don’t have anything to say back to that other than thank you. It really does mean a lot that you’re helping us. Also I thought you were supposed to give a lecture in Seoul.”



“I can reschedule a lecture anytime, She needs our help and I’m doing this of my own accord. You may as well go chill, plus I think Seol should have some company. Susan and I will let you know once we’ve reached the Baxter Building.”



I go into the other room to find Seol asleep in a bed. *“I guess private jets have everything damn.”* I sit down next to her and start stroking her hair. Looking online at more discourse surrounding the situation, most fans are happy for her and think it’s adorable that she’s in love, but there are still a concerningly high amount of rude and disgusting comments. *“Whore, Slut, Backstabber, Cheater. Couldn’t resist being a mail order bride.”* Even some death threats for me. All of these from clearly obsessive fans. I finally stumble across the original picture that someone got of us at the mall. Very clearly showing her hair and face, us holding hands, but luckily for me, my head was turned at the moment.



She wakes up and looks at me.



“Hey sleeping beauty.”



She sits up and grabs my wrists. “You know nothing will ever change the way I feel about you. If I could quit right now and not lose every dollar I’ve ever earned, I would. I love you too much to let this be a deal breaker. We’re gonna find a way out of this.”



“And I’m gonna be by your side every step of the way.” I slide my hands down into hers. 



We sit for a moment in silence and then she leans towards me and wraps her arms around me and rests her head on my chest, pushing me down flat. “Let’s get some more sleep, we got a lot ahead of us. Oh yeah and you’re my pillow.” 



She’s got me trapped but I don’t mind. I move over and wrap my arm around her so that we’re face to face. 



…



“Welcome to the Baxter Building. Except this time there’s no vampire apocalypse to deal with.” 



Susan takes us through the main entrance and cracks what's apparently a joke. It gets a chuckle out of Seol. “What the hell are you guys talking about?” 



“In the Timestream Entanglement we fought Dracula in another universe's New York City where he had taken over Central Park and cast an eternal night. I don’t think you realize just how much stuff happened while I was there. “



“I see…”



“Reed, go have Herbie prepare the guest room. You two are welcome to stay at the Baxter Building for a while or you can find your own place to stay.” 



“As long as your brother stops hitting on me, I’d be glad to stay here. Where are Johnny and Ben anyway?” 



“Called them before we landed, Ben is down at Yancy street with Alicia and my brother didn’t answer but knowing him he’s asleep in bed with some random girl he met last night.” She sighs and walks us to the elevator. 

“Hi Herbie! You adorable lil machine!” Seol gives the robot a hug like its a dog. 



“Hello Ms. Hee, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance once again.” 



“You know this robot really? You have got to tell me more about what happened in the Timestream babe.” I bend down and shake hands with the robot. “Hello Herbie.” 



“Yeah I definitely will, it was such a crazy few months.”



Reed walks back in “The room is ready for you to stay as long as it takes for all this to blow over. Go settle in, Matt is on his way.” 



“You mean Matt Murdock? The blind guy who was in the timestream who's also kind of an asshole?”



“Yes Luna, Him.” 



“HE’S A LAWYER?” 



“One of New York's finest.” 



She exhales sharply and looks irritated. “I don’t like him very much but if you say he’s competent, I guess I have no reason to doubt him.” 



“What did he do to you?” 



“The one from this universe called my music ear grating and other versions of him gave me absolute hell in combat. Beating the shit out of me constantly.” 



“Well Luna in his defense, every universe had their heroes scrambled. Every single one of us really thought we were fighting for what was right even if it was the Doctor Dooms manipulating the chronovium. But also I recall you putting icicles in peoples skulls too. Can’t count how many times other versions of you froze me solid.” 



“I guess but he didn’t have to be an asshole about my music.” 



“Yeah I can’t defend him on that one. Your music is just fine if you ask me, but I prefer music without lyrics while I work.” 



Reed walks away and Herbie leads us to our room.   
  


…



Susan knocks “Hey you two Matts here and he wants to talk to you guys.” 



“So Luna, you need my help?”



“Hello Matt, and yes. I simply want you to go through my contract and find any contradictions, loopholes, or ways that I can argue having a boyfriend does not void it.” 



“What kind of contract is this that Mr Fantastic over here couldn’t get you anything from it?” Motioning towards Reed at his desk.



“It’s… my contract with my agent and record label. The one I had to sign to become an idol.” 



“Luna, are you insane? You really broke this contract? Those performance agencies will sue you for every dollar you have.” 



“We know, Mr Murdock. And that’s why we want you to see if you can find any loopholes.” I go up to him and shake his hand. 



“And who are you?”



“The boyfriend.” 



“Figured. Alright, I’ll go through it, but I’m not a charity. This contract feels quite long and I’ll probably have to listen to it multiple times. I cannot guarantee that anything will come from it. Give me a week and $10000 and I’ll see what I can find. Unlike Reed, I am a business man.”



“I’m helping out a friend Matt.” Reed calls out



“She’s not my friend, merely my client.”



*“God this dude is an asshole.”* 



“So, Luna, do we have a deal?” 



“Babe, are you sure about this?” I take her off to the side and start talking quietly



“I don’t think I have another choice. Yes he’s a massive dick but-”



“I can hear you. I’m blind not deaf.” He turns his head towards us.



“Fine Murdock we have a deal.”



“Send me the money and I’ll have everything I can find to you by the 2nd of the new year. Pleasure doing business.” They shake hands and he walks out with the contract. 



“Probably should have given you more warning about how he is, Sorry Luna.” Susan sighs and walks towards us. “But, hey you’re here in New York, right before New Years. I’m sure if you asked, Tony would let you come to his New Years party with some of the avengers, us, and probably a few other people here and there.”



“It sounds fun but what about you?” She grabs my hand and looks up at me. 



“I don’t mind you going without me, you need a safe place to go destress with some friends and I think this is the perfect opportunity.”



“I’m sure Tony would let you tag along too, if you don’t mind some others finding out about him that is. It’s not a public party so you should be fine.” Susan pulls out her phone. “I can let him know right now if you like.”



“I mean shit, a New Years party with Tony Stark? I am so down, but it’s up to you babe.” 



“Why not?” She shrugs and smiles.



“Sounds like a grand time. I might as well show up this year as well, Johnny has been trying to get me to go for like a decade.” Reed gets up from his desk



A faint smell hits my nose. “Does anyone else smell smoke?”



“Speak of the devil and he shall appear. Susan! Your brother is home.” 



One of the large glass panels on the side of the building opens up and the Human Torch flies through it and extinguishes his flames once he reaches the ground. “Flame off. Hey sis.”



The front door opens at the same time. “Hey Susie, Sorry my entrance ain’t as flashy but I’m back. Alicia says hi.” 



“Hi guys. Good to see you two.” Susan gives her brother and friend a hug.



“Can’t believe ya missed Christmas with us!” Ben goes over and greets Reed as well.



“Well sis? Did you get me a present?” He looks around and notices Seol and I, but mostly her. “Oh wow you did.” He starts to walk towards us. “Hey Luna, It’s *very* good to see you aga-”



Susan pulls him back with a forcefield. “Johnny. Why must I discipline you like I’m your mother? She is not here for you.” 



“Aww come on, I know she can’t resist this hot stuff. Fire and ice, it’s really poetic if you think about it.” 



*“What a sleazy guy.”* I start walking towards him. “So, you’re the-” 



“Hiii Johnny.” Seol cuts me off and goes up to him. 



“Hey there. So, we saved the world, can I ask you out again? Also, who's that guy?” He looks over her shoulder at me.



“Oh him? Well, I think it’s better if I show you.” She walks to me and grabs my hand. 



*“Really? We’re doing this again?”* 



“This guy, Johnny, He’s…” She turns around and throws her arms around my neck and pulls me down. Our lips make contact and she jumps up into my arms and then puts her legs around me.



*“Is this a little weird? Yeah probably but I’m not gonna complain.”* 



After probably 30 seconds of making out she pulls back and makes eye contact with Johnny. “This is my boyfriend. Sorry buddy, but not really.” She looks back at me. “God it’s so hot when you pick me up like that.” She gets down and walks over to him. “Go hit on another girl.”



I look around at Susan, Reed, and Ben and they’re all very clearly holding in laughter. “Sorry dude but she’s with me.” He just kinda stands there looking shocked. 



“Serves you right for hittin on random ladies.” Ben gives him a playful jab then walks over to us. “Hey there pop-star. It’s good to see ya again. And that was very funny, thanks for bringin his ego downa peg.” They fist bump and he turns his attention to me.



“Hi Ben! I’m doing fine and this is my boyfriend.” 



“I’m honored to meet yet another member of the Fantastic Four. Mr. Grimm.” 



“You can call me Ben. I’m surprised that Miss Snow here never mentioned you. How long the two of ya been datin?”



“Almost 3 years.” 



Johnny finally speaks up. “If you were dating before the timestream then why were you receptive to my flirting?” 



“I thought it would be funny. I didn’t think you’d actually take it seriously.” 



“My idiot brother takes any compliment from a woman seriously.” 



“Anywho, whatcha doin in New York?” 

“Well I’m actually in a bit of trouble but long story short k-pop stars having romantic partners is a big nono, I breached my contract with my agencies, and now I’ve hired Matt Murdock to go through it professionally and see if we can find any legal loopholes. If he can’t find anything I’m gonna have to make some tough choices.” 



“Well I’m sorry to hear that sweetheart, I don’t know how much I can do but if theres anythin The Thing can do to help. Let me know.” 



“Thanks Ben.” I give him a fist bump.



“Anytime you two.”



“Susan, let's call Mr Stark and let him know that there’s gonna be three more at his New Years party this year.” 



…



“She can come if she sings for free!” Comes from speaker phone



“Come on Tony, what the he-”



“Christ Reed have you ever heard a joke in your entire life? Yes she can come and she can bring her boyfriend too. Which I already knew about by the way.” 



“HUH? Mr. Stark? How could you possibly know?” 



“If you’re really that curious I can tell you on New Years. Anyway, gotta go. Friday Hang up.” The line goes silent. 



“I guess I could perform. If it’s just people I’d know, I honestly don’t mind.” 



“I’d kill to see you perform live baby.” 



“Well you’re in luck! And maybe if you’re really lucky you’ll get an additional performance just for you.”



“Lil too much information there pop star.” 



“Sorry!”



“Luna, would you like to go shopping with me?” Susan grabs her hand. 



“Well I don’t really wanna get caught out in public right now.” 



“Oh darn, you know what would be really useful? If we could just disappear at will… Oh wait. Come on, let's go! I’ll take you to the best shopping spots in Manhattan.” 



“And just like that, they’re gone.” Reed walks up behind me. “It really is funny to see Susan acting all like that again. They have a very mother daughter relationship, maybe it’s making up for opportunities she never got since our kids weren't exactly normal. Now, I have to get back to work.” 



“Alright well I’m out. Flame On!” Johnny flies away.



“Hey there loverboy, lemme show ya round the Baxter Buildin. Come on.” Ben motions for me to follow him. 



“Sweet, thanks man.”

For me, I..."" and then list a more ""normal"" thing *he* does/would do in that situation. Example (i was a barista until recently):

`Me: So I had someone yesterday get mad when I said we were out of almond milk...like, man, I can't make more appear for you!`  
`Friend: Wow, that's so annoying! For me, when I go to a coffee shop, I do ask for almond, but if they don't have it, I just ask for something else like a normal person.`

like, don't get me wrong, i appreciate that he acknowledged how annoying that situation was & that he's polite in coffee shops and stuff, and in moderation, this is a normal response. my issue isn't really what he said so much as the fact that he has this response to *all kinds* of stuff i tell him & *always* in the context of ""i do this more normal thing, i'm a normal guy, not like the guy you just told me about"". honestly i can't really even define what specifically annoys me, i just know that it does, and i'm looking for others' thoughts on this and if anyone else has dealt with this situation. does this behavior annoy you? if so, how did you tactfully address it? or is this an irrational annoyance and i should adjust my perspective? thank you so much for reading!",3,1769204679.0,socialskills,6,1.0,False

Anyone else prefer one on one chats instead of big group conversations? I’m introverted and do much better talking with one person at a time.

My schedule is a little unconventional, so I’m often around at odd hours and open to random conversations. I’m into easy, low pressure chats about everyday life, random thoughts, books, shows, or just being sarcastic together. Small talk isn’t really my thing, but relaxed conversation is.

When it’s warm out I’m usually outside on trails or walking, and when it’s cold I slow things down with coffee, TV, and reading. Pretty laid back and a good listener.

* *Carts for cocktail hour* \- May nabook na akong 100 pax coffee booth, 100 pax grazing table, and onsite studio booth na gift from entourage. Okay na kaya to para maentertain yung guests before entering the reception hall? Thinking of getting potato corner stand pandagdag sa snacks, live stamping booth for guest souvenirs, tattoo booth (kinda pricey but most of our guests are artists/millenials) live doodle artist, or mobile bar.
* *Crew meals for suppliers* \- Pwede kayang suppliers only yung magkaroon ng crew meal? Yung guests na mag aayos sa preparation venue, paluto/food tray yung sa kanila?
* *Bridal bouquet* \- I have a specific bridal bouquet na hindi raw kaya ni church stylist hehe. Is it okay to book another supplier for this one? Meron ba sa Pampanga na bridal bouquet only yung ibbook?
* No prep shoot with the entourage, planning of having more candid moments during the preparation with family. Okay naman ba sa SDE yung post-nup shoot if yun lang yung moment na isshoot with the whole abays? Meron din kasing iilang abay na nasa family during the prep. Or what if punta sila sa prep venue nang naka gayak na para may shoot pa rin with them?
* No exchange gift with the groom to be hehe sobrang dami na namin nagastos and we already booked our honeymoon, okay lang ba na first touch or first look yung moment namin sa SDE? Pero may wedding vows pa rin naman po. Medyo nonchalant kasi kami pareho hahah ang hirap yata hulihin ng candid moments jusko huhu
* Laidback, feel-good SDE style na more on candids, but still may mga cinematic shots pwede kaya yun? Basta nothing pilit and high fashion kasi di ko sya gustong magmukhang showcase ng details etc. Paano kaya maexplain to :((((((

Medyo nakaka overwhelm yung palapit na ng palapit yung church date pero every detail and what if/s iniisip ko hahah thank you so much in advance! If may reco din kayo on how to add something art-related sa wedding, please po hehe.",1,1769204555.0,WeddingsPhilippines,0,1.0,False

I got pushed into the position myself in November 2025. I was a regular team lead then in October they said they’re forcing me. I made so much more being a team lead and flex driver because the catering tips, I would’ve loved to have been a catering lead but we supposedly don’t make enough in catering to have one. Now I’m hearing that we need a catering lead by March… but they’ll never give it to me because they want me to stay in the TLMIC, even though I am the most experienced in preparing and delivering catering orders. 

Even though it’s a dual position (Team lead, manager in charge) you’re still expected to act and dress as a manager at all times, even if you’re clocked in as team lead. No T-shirts allowed, not even Panera ones, only polos. Be prepared for the team managers to ask you to do manager stuff even if you’re deployed as a team lead associate so they don’t have to do anything :/. I remember my first shift I opened as manager then at 10am when the GM came in I was deployed as cashier for lunch with another cashier. It was busy and I had no time to do any of the missions such as temps, and my GM honestly could’ve done them but he makes it a rule that he doesn’t do them, so I did them and the other cashier was by herself during lunch and had it all handed to her to do dining, cashier, barista, coffees, etc. She was really struggling. I also hate that I’m not allowed to float around where needed. The drive thru could have a whole line and I’m not allowed to help, two associates just have to deal themselves. 

I pretty much do all the stuff the team managers and GM don’t want to do. Or, if they’re closing and they see I’m the one opening the store the next day there’s a lot of stuff they don’t bother doing that I have to deal with because they assume that I’ll just do it and they don’t have to. I also am the only manager who clopens all the time. I can already see into February it goes open as manager, close as manager, open as manager, then close as manager again, then I know the day after that I will open as an associate/team lead. 

I think the issue for me is I don’t like being both team lead and manager. I rather just be one or the other. I considered asking to step down and be a regular team lead, or just leave the store altogether because they may make me feel bad about stepping down. We have the GM, then AGM and 2 team managers. The AGM is leaving this year and one team manager might leave as well. So it’ll just be one GM, one team manager and me the TLMIC. I feel like we’re cooked. ",1,1769204476.0,Panera,0,1.0,False

Life seems simpler when you can’t afford to worry about anything but the bare minimum. I wander through Toronto with a backpack that’s basically my whole life. Hitting up dispensaries with my shelter buddy, still working on that friend promotion but she's my buddy at heart.

 

We took over the city, holding on to the last bit of sanity we at during these times, with some frequent sightseeing and wholesome conversations.  In the middle of all this I tireless tell myself “I got this” while also asking myself “what the actual hell am I doing?”. One day I feel energized and happy  going the gym, next I’m having midnight strolls to McDonald’s for a sweet treat.

 

Though it all seems like fun and games until the role you play in society really hits your reality. Walking into the shelter home on the streets of King West, not too far from the finance district, with people watching you. Falling asleep on a mat, escaping into exciting vivid dreams only to wake up to the same mat you fell asleep in not later than 7 in the morning. Shamelessly waiting in line for bread, boiled eggs, and butter to get through the morning. But nothing cheered me up like a my first cup of coffee in the morning, regardless of where I was. Even when you hit rock bottom, I learned that its important to keep yourself happy and make the most of what you have. Improvising what’s given to make each day a little better. Though I had a generous amount of space in the shelter along with internet to get the work I need to get done, yet not matter where you go, peace and quiet seems to be hard to find, unless your dead. A lot of the peers I shared the space with were suffering from mental health disorders and withdrawals symptoms, so it was hard gathering my thoughts together.

I'm from the EU, so buying overseas is a very big and expensive hassle.

We're going on holiday to the states coming april, and we're starting our trip in Charlotte.

OF COURSE we're going to the Sorce store :)

I've been e-mailing them, and they're not sure what the stock situation will be when we're there.

Because of that, they proposed I already tell them what I'm interested in, so they can put an order aside and send me an invoice. 

In other words: I can't sample or sniff before buying.

In general I like sweet scents, gourmand, green, musky, fresh, soapy, minty, powdery, and white floral scents.

I don't like smokey, woody or spicy scents

Because of an earlier order on LuckyScent (where I paid an ungodly amount for shipping & customs), I have already sampled Match Made in Heaven (LOVE), Snow Moon Magic (expected it to be sweeter? Was really spicy on me), and 2AM in Lafayette (overpowering coffee note, but I like it!).

This is the list I consider buying:

Pretty sure:

\- English Major 

\- In Dreams & Fairytales (which one's the best?)

\- Where the Wild Things Grow ll

\- This is not a Love Spell 

\- Venus in Fleurs

The ones I'm not so sure of:

\- Where the Wild Things Grow l

\- Serpentine

\- Fuckery

\- Stuck on You

\- The Things Unsaid

\- Vampire Wife

\- The Bees

\- Cabanilla

Special orders should there be an order window close to when we arrive:

\- A Party or Something

\- Beautiful but Annihilating

\- Circe

\- Dark Skies

\- Dragonfly Wings

\- Love & Complications

\- Mermaids Sing of Lost Lovers

\- Nothing Burns Like the Cold

\- The Fairy Queen's Revenge

People who know Sorce, and sampled lots of their fragrances: based on what I just told you, are there perfumes in this list that are a must buy/don't buy?

1ql3s4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ql3s4f/my_girlfriend_keeps_taking_selfies_in_her_sleep/,My girlfriend keeps taking selfies in her sleep.,"Angela has been my girlfriend for going-on three years now, and I’ve loved every second of it.

I never thought I’d meet someone like her: sweet in a way that isn’t performative, outgoing without being loud, kind without keeping score. I know it’s cliché to call a relationship “perfect,” and I’m not trying to sell you anything. I just mean… it just fit. 

My parents adored her, maybe even as much as I did. She had this soft, unstoppable ambition - she had dreams of becoming a published author, always tapping away on her laptop after dinner whilst I relaxed on the couch. But without fail, every night, she’d close the lid and slide right there next to me, where she’d fall asleep on my shoulder. Then I’d carry her in my arms, carefully choosing my steps not to wake her, and tuck her into bed, and afterwards I’d clean up a little, turn off the television, and join her. Picturesque. Every night.

Until I kept waking up to a phone below 10%. 

It would happen semi-regularly; I’d say every second day, maybe once every three. I’d wake up to my alarm, go to hit snooze, and notice the ‘low battery’ alert on my home screen. The charger would be on the floor at the bottom of the bedside table, coiled up and pathetic, having somehow left the charging port in the night. Nothing was worse than having to do my morning business staring at the bathroom tiles. 

I brought it up to Angela after the third time. 

“Hey, love?” I asked from above a bowl of cornflakes. Her beautiful auburn hair, still in messy ribbons fresh from the shower, lightly flicked as she turned to face me.

“What’s up?” She asked. Calm. Polite. Genuine.

“Have you been unplugging my phone at night?” I asked, awfully careful to keep my tone as light-hearted as possible, but I had no other real explanation. I mean, the charging port was clean as a whistle and it *felt* secure. Maybe she was just charging her bluetooth earbuds or maybe the charger on her side of the bed was busted. All I wanted was an explanation.

“No,” She replied, slowly closing the fridge door, “I promise. I’ve been sleeping through the night.”

She was a heavy sleeper - always has been. Down to even the tone of her voice, there was no question that she was telling the truth. 

“Maybe it’s the-” she reached up to grab a bowl from the cabinet, huffing slightly, “-cable, maybe it’s loose or something.”

I nodded in agreement, dropped a canned joke I can’t remember…and that was that. We went on with our day. I did end up taking her advice, picking myself up a fresh charger on the ride home from work, and that night there was no issue. 

Problem solved. Thank fuck for that.

Except, it happened again. 

Rolling over with a yawn half-cast in my mouth, I go to turn off the alarm.  
There’s no alarm.

Fucking phone’s dead.

Angela was still out like a light with her Samsung plugged in next to the jewellery on her nightstand, drinking in all the charge it needed, and here I am, holding a paperweight. For a few moments I remained still; reminding myself to breathe and cooling off, there was nothing left to do but plug it back in and head to the bathroom to start my day.

Reaching down, I fumbled for the wire in the dark and jabbed it into my phone. There wasn’t a peep as I slipped out from the covers and headed down the hall.

Confronting her? Not an option.

No, I had to figure things out on my own. So whilst I was at work, I slipped my phone from my desk drawer and started flipping through options in the settings.

There was a charging graph, there in the battery tab. Green upward line for charging, red downward line for losing battery. It was an older phone so I expected some battery drain - but at around two in the morning, every night, the upward curve would instantly plummet down into a red slope. 

Settings. Security. Device activity.

A single unlock, it happened every night around the same time the phone would stop charging. Last night: 2:08am.

You needed a PIN. No face ID. No swipe. No ‘lift to unlock.’ I stared at the screen until the numbers blurred, because I knew the only other person who knew that code was my girlfriend. 

Yeah, *sleeping through the night*.

Why? Was she pranking me? Angela once tried throwing me a surprise birthday party but completely blew it because she couldn’t bear keeping a secret from me for more than a day. Bare-faced lying to me during breakfast? No. Not from her, not from Angela.

Knowing what I did, I turned off my phone and tried desperately to get back to work. 

That lasted maybe 20 minutes. 

Sooner or later I was right back on it, filing through every app: messages, notes, texts, emails, searching for exactly what it was she was doing on my phone so early in the morning. I hate to admit it, but my first thought was that she was suspecting me of something. Why else would she pull this cloak-and-dagger stuff?

I didn’t cheat on my girlfriend, alright. That was a fact. There was nothing to hide in the first place. If she wanted to look, she only had to ask…I mean, that’s why she knows the pin in the first place.

I opened the gallery because it was the last place left to check.

5 different photos stood out to me. I’m not exactly a photography person - I mean, Angela is - but my camera roll is mostly filled with QR codes, snaps of where I’ve parked and screenshots from online clothes retailers. Somewhere in that mess is a photo from college. 

And amongst all of that, sat under ‘Most Recent’, were 5 different photos of Angela.

‘Selfies’ - I guess. She’d snapped them from the shoulders up, her hair a frizzy mess from her pillow, and my silhouette slumped across the mattress to her left. She’s bolt upright and she’s smiling into the camera, flash on.

I love Angela’s smile. When you think of something so much, you can tell when you’re looking at a counterfeit. Whatever was staring back from my phone screen was a cheap knockoff, I really don’t know how else to describe it. 

Maybe it was in the eyes. They were two marbles pressed against her face. They looked like someone had cut them out of a magazine and pasted them over the real ones. They didn’t squint against the flash. They didn’t soften. They just… *stayed* there.

No, maybe it was the mouth itself. A perfectly visible top row of her teeth, a slight sag to her bottom lip that left it lopsided. Her face looked tensed up; not loose, like how she usually smirked whenever we took a picture together. I exited out onto my home screen, a photo of she and I perched in front of a sunset on our vacation to Hawaii, and the difference of her face as night and day.

That was my girlfriend.

I tapped back onto the gallery.

That was not.

Every photo coincided with the unlock times, the earliest being 1:37am and the latest at almost 4 in the morning. They were virtually identical, bar a change of clothes, always with me very slightly in frame.

My manager swung by and I quickly pocketed it, pretending to type and thinking all the meanwhile. I’d bring it up to her tonight after dinner, I figured.

“Hey, Ange, I found something weird on my phone.”  
It was a little after 7, my hands were still damp from the dishes and she was on the kitchen table with her Macbook casting a blue glow across her face. She stopped typing and turned, grasping the back of the chair, eyes like a deer in headlights.

“Uh, what’s up?” She asked, “Everything okay?”  
“Sorta.”  
Dredging my hands across a dishcloth, I took my phone from the counter and flicked through to those photos. “You’re…uh,” I approached, careful with my words, “...sleepwalking?”

Angela’s eyes fixed on the screen and her brow instantly turned up. I flicked through all five. Emotion stirred across her face, an unplaceable mix of shock and confusion, and she took the phone in her hands to scan back through.

“You’re taking them and putting my phone back on my nightstand, unplugged,” I said with a surprised exhale, trying my best for a perplexed smile. 

“I…” She went through for another round of swiping before handing me it back, “I guess I’m dreaming of being an influencer.”

We shared a chuckle. Mine sounded tinny.

There was a shred of hope that bringing it up would stop it dead in its tracks. A few nights later, that hope was shredded. A dead phone lay on my nightstand.

When I could, I went through and found the new photo. Nothing had changed from the others, she still had that forced smile - something you’d see on LinkedIn.

The idea of sleeping on the couch sparked my mind on the drive back from work a few nights later. I cringed at it. There was a stabbing pain to my chest when imagining her face as I took my pillow off the bed and grabbed a blanket from the cupboard: the guilt of it all. 

It’s not her fault, I know that. Everything up to this point was picture-fucking-perfect, separating us over my phone battery felt…immoral. Idiotic, even.

There was also the idea of changing my PIN, equally as undesirable, as I didn’t want to break that trust we’d spent 3 years building between ourselves. 

So I figured I’d stay up, catch her in the act. I read somewhere once that it wasn’t a good idea to wake somebody up who’s sleepwalking - but if I just observed I could figure another way around this. 

That night I put my coffee machine to good use and got a few cups down after dinner. Even Angela remarked - “coffee, this late?” - and I told her I had some report to write, a little white lie. When she was finally tired enough to go to bed, I told her I’d be there in a bit and made her comfortable on the mattress. Curling my fingers against the string of the lamp near the entrance, I gave a gentle pull and the room plunged to darkness.

I plugged my phone in and left the door ajar.

After hours of watching late-night television on mute, fighting against my flickering eyelids, and throwing back coffee, there was movement. A slight creak of the bedframe brought me back into the land of the living, and I gently turned my head away from Jimmy Kimmel on *Who wants to be a Millionaire?* to spy the entrance to our bedroom.

Her silhouette brushed by the gap in the door as she walked across to my side of the bed. Sure enough there was the telltale click of a charger being removed. Afterwards, muffled footsteps trailed as she gently eased herself back across the slit in the doorway. Covers shifted. She got into bed.

I started my approach. Creeping. My toes were stiffly pressing into the wood of the hallway floor. I was a kid again, sneaking snacks after dark. Everything jittered from the caffeine, my breath hissed.

The door was an arm’s length away. I gently touched the brass above the handle and let it drift further and further into the room. Hinges squeaked, and after a moment, I heard the aperture clack of a photograph being taken.

“Babe?” I asked as I looked toward the bed.

There she was, stiff-jointed and sat with her legs flat under the covers. She had her arm raised with the phone tight in her grip, smiling. It was even more unnerving in person. She wasn’t looking into the camera, more through it - burrowing a hole straight towards the wall.

“Babe?” I repeated.

Angela’s head snapped, literally fucking *snapped*, toward me. A flicker of movement, half a second tops. She was smiling at me now.

“Darling.”

She drew out both vowels: Angela never called me ‘darling.’ Matter of fact, I hated the word. 

“You’re sleepwalking…” I replied back, catching myself on my own words. There was no hiding it. I felt terror, raw terror. And, for the first time looking at my girlfriend, revulsion.

There was nothing. I hated nothing. I’d rather any other word from her mouth than the silence that followed. 

And then I realised I should’ve been careful with what I wished for.

Her mouth dropped open and she screeched. The noise could’ve shattered fine china, a whine that unearthed itself from the core of her throat and slashed across the room. It was primal, something reserved for our earliest ancestors, only to signify imminent danger.

Covers shifted and she jumped up, swinging her legs out of the bed. 

I jumped back and felt the stiff lampstand hit against my leg - it teetered, drifted, fell. The room was dark. The lightbulb was out, rolling in a small circle on the floorboards.

Under the small trickle of light from the hallway, I saw motion. Stomps. It was as if she was wading through the air, like it had become thick. 

“Darling.”

My feet acted without impulse, dragging me further and further out of the room. She continued. The bulb was right there. 

Her bare foot came across it with a sickening crunch. Her body jutted slightly where her weight was misplaced.

Glass. In her foot, on the floor. 

There was no turn in her eyes; she merely bent her knees and planted her feet in reaction. That wet smudge as she adjusted turned my stomach. Her mouth opened again.

I was out of the room now, and with a pulsing heart, I leant forward and took the doorhandle in both hands. With a twist of my waist, I heaved back, the boom of it against the frame outperforming the second scream from my girlfriend’s mouth.

“Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.”  
I repeated that as I held the door shut. Fight or flight.

Fight the love of my life? I had to go.

I turned and barrelled down the hallway: wearing nothing but boxer shorts and a t-shirt, I struggled with my keys on the hook by the door. In a snap-decision, I swiped my wallet from the glass dish near the shoe rack - could be gone for a while - and then I plunged myself into the cold of the night.  
Just my luck, I thought, as sideways rain and wind snapped against my exposed arms. Anything was better than what was in there. I hopped into our shared car, practically choking at the familiarity of her perfume, and twisted the gears into reverse.

The dashboard read ‘2:47am’ as I pulled into the only motel I knew, just off the highway onramp. I checked myself in for the night, although I could’ve spent it in the car: I just wanted the space. Barefoot and dripping wet in the reception, I must’ve been a sad sight for the poor clerk.

With no phone and without the stomach for any more late-night TV, I must’ve spent hours tossing and turning over the cheap motel bedsprings. Going over it, again and again. The glass. That crunch. The scream. But as the caffeine and the adrenaline left hand-in-hand, the world started to fog over. In only a few more moments, I would’ve been out like a light.

But the motel’s cheap door had caught on the deadbolt.

Amidst a caffeine crash for the ages, every limb felt arduous to move. My back was to the entrance as I stared across the ugly green wallpaper, but I could hear the movement. Hell, I could feel the draw of wind as the door finally managed to open.

There were wet, fleshy slaps of feet across the floorboard. 

I tried to move. I yearned to move. Couldn’t.

Covers ruffled. Bedsprings wheezed. Breath drew from whatever was behind me.

Taps. My phone’s opening sound. 

The snap of a photograph.

It was her. If not for the same ritual, it was the rapidly-spreading wet patch under the covers where my feet lay.

She slid out of the covers and continued the same process, circling the bedframe. Her movement was laboured, that cut up foot was beginning to show through her unsettling calm.

“Ba-” No words would come from my mouth, it was as if somebody had tied a pebble to the underside of my tongue; I couldn’t even crease my lips to speak. Sleep tugged and tugged at me to just close my eyes.

Angela dragged herself to the nightstand. The blood across her hands was still wet. And, in a surprising turn, I saw her hunch over near one of the plug sockets. Awkward and confused, she seemed to jam something against it over and over, until finally it caught. She ran her hand across the wire now protruding from the wall until she found its end, turning next to my phone which she struggled to grasp with her other hand. It was as if she hadn’t encountered these things before. 

Drawing them together, I heard the slight chime of my battery beginning to charge.

Oh, my Angela. 

She turned to watch over me wearing the same smile.

I knew we’d work it out. We are perfect. Picture perfect.

She trudged slowly back to her side of the bed and gently began to climb across the mattress until her body pressed against mine. It was cold and slippery.

I never thought I’d meet somebody like Angela. Sweet, outgoing, kind. I heard once that relationships are a two-way street: of course you’re bound to have arguments, but it’s the sorting things out that counts, you know?

How do we move forward?,"My bf and I were at a coffee shop about an hour ago and I keep a tarot deck in my purse. He doesn't know how to shuffle cards properly-- he does that thing where you swirl the cards around in your hands for a few minutes and call it a day. It's not the same thing as shuffling, but it's really not a big deal to me.

We each did a reading for each other. For those who don't know, between readings, there are a few different ways to ""cleanse"" the cards, like holding them in sunlight or moonlight for a while, or shuffling. This makes it so that the energy of different readings doesn't bleed over. (I totally get folks who aren't ""woo-woo"" might not care about this, so if it bothers you, just ignore this part lol)

After we each did a reading, I said that I wanted to do a reading for myself with the cards shuffled. I jokingly said, ""because you don't know how to shuffle."" My tone was really lighthearted-- at least, that was the intention.

My bf got upset at this. He took out his phone and started scrolling while I did my reading. Afterwards, he started saying ""You're a bad person, like, morally"" and other stuff in that vein. I think he was partially joking but it was in that way where you can tell the person is being a little serious. I said that I would like to leave. I don't like being berated in public.

On the walk back, he said that I ""critique every little thing he does"" and that ""the way you \[meaning me, the OP\] shuffle is perfect and everything I do is ruined."" He said that I ""cut him out of the activity."" I explained a few times that I wanted to talk about the reading with him and share it together. Reading the cards is the fun part of a tarot reading; I just want my readings to be accurate. He said that I ""cut him out"" of the activity. I said that he cut himself out when he took out his phone--I wanted to talk about the reading with him! When we got home he asked to talk and said, ""are the cards being shuffled more important to you than me?"" and I'm just like. Dude. I've explained this several times. Idk. We're both frustrated.

“They are the part that moves before fear can”

Sparky on The Body Layer of nanites

Sparky stayed at his terminal, an item so old it was no longer considered obsolete. It just wasn’t considered. Like a flint hammer at a gun fight.

Then Feebee understood. It was part of the test. Deflection. A distraction. She looked at Sparky, was he reading her now?

Maybe, maybe not. He hadn’t reacted to the insight.

The buzzing chatter from the nanites built then suddenly became disjointed, confused? She felt around within the remaining noise.

Sparky spoke up, “I’m seeing disruption in your nanites’ behavioural cycles.”

“My what?” asked Feebee.

Before Sparky could answer, Kirr explained. ‘The nanites would normally notice something like a build-up of lactic acid when you over-exercising. They’d rally round and try to process it out of your system. If that helps they keep doing it, if not they’d adjust and repeat the cycle until the lactic acid levels are back to normal levels. Same with tissue repair. Yes?’

‘Yes,’ Feebee understood.

 

As she processed what they’d just told her a stabbing pain build in her stomach. “What’s happening?” She could no longer hold herself still. She gave into the pain and curled up into a ball.

“Fight back. It’s only pain.”

 

He pushed harder. Gave, nor offered any quarter.

“Stop it Sparky. Please. It hurts.” Her looks were daggers.

“Find the noise causing this. You can stop it.”

 

The pain continued to build. Unrelenting.

 

She dived into the buzzing nanite chatter. Listening, and found a single stream of muffled noise. A dark noise that had a different signature, a different feel. It covered and masked some of the nanites’ chatter. She followed it, moving upstream. Carefully, with the lightest of touches she pulled back the veil.

 

*I am a moment of quiet within your noise. I am stillness within your movement.*

She repeated it.

It brought calmness, brought peace to her stillness.

 

The noise was a steady trickle exploiting a vulnerability. How?

She tasted the disruption as it leached into her. It was vile but the signature. It reminded her of something. Someone?

 

She looked at Sparky. Although his hands moved across the keyboard, his lips moved to a different tune. A tune that aligned with the evil digital stench, a vile evil veil violating her.

 

Feebee laughed, *evil, vile and veil all have the same letters.* Sparky read her and laughed too.

As he did, his lips ceased to move and there was a moment when the flow stood still and the veil lifted for a second.

 

Feebee saw her chance. She demanded that her nanites disrupt the source.

PUSH BACK!!!.

She gave the deep third layer, The Silent ones, the Agency to attack, to disrupt, to protect her. They would try, adapt and repeat until they were successful.

 

The tone of nanite chatter within her changed, became quiet and still. Most of the nanites withdrew, making way for The Silent ones to act.

 

Although they were few, The Silent ones were meshed with SolDiri purpose.

 

Feebee’s brain glitched. A flash of old memories, ancient memories dropped into her consciousness. Just like that.

“You Ok?” Sparky looked concerned.

“Yeh, I’m fine. Memory flashes.” She focused on content now laid bare and exposed for her.

 

It was obvious now, laid out before her with all the clarity the ancients needed to provide. The Silent ones were more than nanites. They were engines of fate wrapped around her bones, interlocked with the mesh augmenting her nervous system.

 

The majority of nanites defended and maintained her. They did it very well. The Silent ones were different; they watched and were imbued with SolDiri purpose. They were highly effective and could attack as an autonomous nanite group, an ANG, so Agency had to be given sparingly.

 

Each ANG held a remnant, a speck of the shattered SolDiri. Each was part of a SolDiri name, willingly given forward, part the SolDiri’s legacy.

 

**And as this was going on…**

The Beast noticed. What was the obsession with these four letters, V  E  L and I.

 

The Beast had found that VELI meant brother in many human languages. Was there hidden meaning in these letters, some sort of secret brotherhood?

The Beast added this query to a growing backlog.

 

It was currently trying to understand why Feebee and Kirr people found it ‘strange but charming’ that there was no inter-dependency between the flavours of quarks. They’d laughed.

*Quarks had flavours but how was that funny?* The Beast needed to understand, else how could it be effective.

Kirr had suggested to Feebee that the problem be viewed ‘top down’. Feebee thought ‘bottom up’, then she’d questioned her whole understanding of the ‘matter’. They’d both roared with laughter.

 

The Beast thrashed.

 

The universe groaned.

 

**Back now…**

 

Feebee had managed to get back into a sitting position, legs crossed.  Fists finally relaxed and on her knees.

Sparky was mouthing commands.

Her pain increased.

She spoke through gritted teeth, ‘You have no right to treat me like this.’

She fought back.

 

Sparky turned to her again and stopped mouthing.

 

The Silent ones were ready this time and leapt across. Into Sparky, piggy backing the carrier he was using to attack her.

The ANG smashed through his defences.

His face went slack.

 

Kirr tried to intervene, but Feebee had isolated herself and given The Silent ones agency. They were called an ANG for a reason.

They replicated with astonishing speed, swarming through Sparky.

So much so that they completely disassembled him in seconds.

 

He just blinked out of existence.

 

‘Feebee, what did you just do?’ It was Kirr, frantic.

‘I PUSHED BACK!!! That’s what I did. I trusted him and he hurt me.’

‘But Feebee, it was a test. An exercise.’

‘Oh. Ok. Good.’ She said, more as a reflex, than anything else.

Kirr immediately came back at Feebee. ‘No! NOT good.’

 

Feebee studied in her room. Electronics and Maths. She found maths hard but was good at arithmetic. Good with numbers.

She ate in her room and then went to bed.

She didn’t sleep.

 

Next morning Feebee got up and walked her normal route to the rest area.

 

The route took her past the armoury.

Peas sat at a bench. In front of her was a rifle, broken down. She was cleaning the parts. Seeing Feebee called out, “Morning Ma’am”

“Morning Peas. Aren’t there other things to clean?”

Peas shrugged, ‘I’ll look into it Ma’am.”

 

In the rest room, the two coffee boys sat alone. Three coffee cups, one still full were on the table. Some biscuits had been left on a plate. Bench press and Spotter were in their corner doing weights.

“Where’s Sparky,” asked Feebee.

 

There was an awkward silence.

 

‘He didn’t make it,’ was all Kirr said.  Feebee tried to get more information, but Kirr wouldn’t say anything beyond that.

 

And so, it went on. Lessons, study but there were also exercises, serials and fight club. She’d enjoyed learning how to fly the copter, but she really liked fight club. Especially with all its variations. She particularly liked a short form of hand-to-hand fighting that focused on quick violent attacks. The method demanded a careful study of the opponent so at to know where to strike with brutal efficiency.

 

The fights all start the same, with a slow walk to the centre of a bare mat. She would sit, cross legged and wait for her opponent to materialise.

 

Breath and stillness were the key.

 

Usually the opponent circles. Her eyes following their movements, looking for imbalance in their step. Prior injuries, vulnerabilities.

 

They move. Feebee doesn’t. They circle around her. Easy steps, she tracks the sound, its information.

She watches and learns, studying them, *where is the centre of balance?*

 

Once found, eyes track that point. Feet and hands, claws and antennae can lie. The centre of balance around which all movement must rotate cannot.

 

She waits, observes. The longer the opponent takes the more she learns.

 

*How does it move. Does it favour one side? How does it breathe? What is the cadence of its breath?*

 

The stillness between breathes changes. Not by much but enough to hear. To know.

 

Its balance shifts slightly. Towards her. She smiles. Not outwardly, that would give away her advantage.

 

She prepares her muscles, forcing energy into them through isometric preloading. Pre-activation, getting them ready to fire-up.

 

It continues to circle until behind her. Its steps change, go quiet. *It’s about to attack*.

 

Then the attack comes. It rushes in.

She is immediately rising to her feet, turning towards the threat. Not away. A knife is suddenly in it’s hand. Outstretched, not by much. A forearm’s length.

 

She feints to the left, steps inside. ‘ENTER’.

 

Then strikes. The knife ignored. No wind-up. Nothing to give away the point of attack. Two fingers into the throat. A crushing kick to the knee, there’s a snap. Like brittle wood. The knee fails. ‘PLACE’.

 

The body drops to the floor, clutching its throat. She has the knife. ‘COLLAPSE’.

No follow-through necessary although she feels the pull to continue. She resists the urge to kill and maim.

 

The drill ends.

She is in the centre of the matt. There is no fanfare. Just a return to silence.

 

Feebee puts the knife in her belt and sits back down. Cross legged, fists relaxed on her knees. Breathing easy, unrushed. Balanced.

 

Another opponent appears and comes forward. This one is a different shape, different form, different weapon. It circles…

 

She followed the same process.

Entry, deny distance.

Placement, disrupt structure.

Collapse, remove balance.

 

**Note to file…**

Self-defence System in place.

Time to engage: Negligible

Noise: None

Physical: On Track  **…END**

 

Her time wasn’t just spent fighting. She studied physiologies she was likely to encounter. Humans and Drexari, but also more obscure species like Crystal Mantids, not all aliens are bipedal. Even other Terran apex predictors like Brown Bears, Lions, Tigers. She hadn’t fought them yet but wanted to.

 

With Sparky gone she had to learn electronics and pick up his workload. ‘Earning her keep’ Kirr called it.

She was able to fix up more of the maintenance droids which in turn could do maintenance work. It was a multiplier that saw the ship heal the scar created by the Asteroid and get back some semblance of control.

But the damage had been done.  Too much lost.

It’s not. Cortisol is necessary. You need it to wake up, regulate blood sugar, manage energy, and respond to stress. The issue isn’t cortisol itself. It’s when it gets out of rhythm and stays “on” all the time.

For a lot of women over 35, that dysregulation shows up as stubborn belly fat, feeling wired but exhausted, poor sleep, brain fog, bloating, cravings, anxiety, or feeling like workouts suddenly stopped working. And no, it’s not a willpower problem. It’s usually your body stuck in protection mode.

Hormonal shifts in your late 30s and 40s play a big role here. Progesterone starts to decline, stress hits harder, sleep gets lighter, and the old strategies (eating less, doing more cardio) often make things worse instead of better.

What actually helps is calming the stress signals your body is getting. That usually means eating enough (especially protein), balancing blood sugar instead of skipping meals, shifting from endless cardio to intentional strength training, and walking more instead of pushing harder. It also means smarter fasting — not extreme fasts or running on coffee all day, plus hydration, electrolytes, and actual recovery.

Most women don’t need to “do more.” They need a system that makes their body feel safe again so cortisol can settle down and fat loss, energy, and sleep can follow.

If this sounds familiar, you’re not broken and you’re not alone. This is incredibly common, and with the right approach, it’s very fixable.",1,1769203922.0,u_FASTerWayToFatLoss,0,1.0,False

(spoilered text is my weight, so that you have an idea of my background. trigger warning!) for context, i am 17, and i've really struggled since the summer of 2024 (when i first lost my cycle). when i began losing weight, i was a bmi of>!24 (70kg at 5'7)!<. i did not need to lose weight, i know that now. life was honestly hellish for the next year, and i stupidly kept pushing. i reached my breaking point during summer of 2025, when i was maintaining around >!bmi 14 (40 kg)!<. i cannot possibly stress how awful this was. i was balding, i had nobody around me, i was miserable and all i wanted was to get better. i committed to recovering around september of 2025, and gained weight **quick**.

i didn't actively choose to go all-in, but i did have extreme hunger. i finished boxes of granola in two days, i quit tracking my calories, and focused heavily on stress reduction. i cut off one of my best friends, took easy classes at school, and ate. one thing that i do want to note, but don't advise, is that i never quit exercise. i think that, had i stopped moving so much, i would've gotten my period months earlier. unfortunately, i have a job in the service industry, and a typical day ends with me having walked 10-20k steps. again, not advisable. i quit the gym for several months, (before lowkey giving up on getting my period back). for the past two months, i've gone to the gym a few days a week. that being said, i never train to failure, i eat right before and right after, and i stopped all high-intensity cardio. no idea how that's affected my cycle returning, but it does help me sleep better.

i wish i had more current statistics to give, but i honestly don't. i haven't stepped on a scale since september, and i haven't been consistently tracking my food at all. if i were to hazard a guess, i'd say i'm roughly >!60kg!< now, and i've probably been eating between 2000-3000 calories a day, even after my extreme hunger wore off. i think that tracking weight and calories would've held me back, but i'm sorry i don't have any clear-cut metrics! all i can say is that i ate a LOT of nuts while regaining the weight, i made sure to have carbs, protein and fat at every meal, and then snacks in between. never drank coffee on an empty stomach, only ate 2% or higher in any dairy product. lots of pepitas. the biggest adjustment leading up to my period was SLEEP. i was an awful sleeper (6 hours a night, average). recently, i've been getting 8-9 and drinking way more water. this has made the biggest difference. please sleep! i know it's corny, but my period really only came when i stopped fixating so much on doing everything perfectly. everyone says it, but it's true.

if you have any questions, please hit me. i'm going to keep taking it very light in the gym for the next few months, but i just wanted to share a testimony that didn't involve going ""all-in"" in the traditional sense. different things are going to work for different people, living different lives, i understand that i am young and my body was probably rearing to get back on track. good luck everybody, keep pushing <3 you've got this

Last week it came on without notice and just ran for about a minute before I tried to stop it. It would not stop. I unplugged it-then it stopped. It would not work when I plugged it back in. I tried many pushes of the button-nothing.

I left it plugged in and low and behold, it came on again hours later. I had coffee in it this time (I was praying for a miracle) and it ground the coffee. And then stopped.

I quickly tried the machine again. Nothing-no response when button pushed. 

So I put another 20 grams in and left it to see what would happen. 

Two days later -fired up again! And it ground the contents. And then it came on two more times in the same afternoon (while empty) for just a few seconds.  And since then it has worked perfectly when I push the button-so far-I’m not really confident that it will continue to do so, however. 

Note that when I say it came on all by itself-it truly does. In all cases no human or animal was within ten feet of the unit when it came on suddenly.

Now it's turning into a long-distance international situationship.,"I (27F) met a guy (29M) on Hinge last Sept while I was on a work trip in the UK. I live in NYC and travel to the UK for work about 2–3 times a year.

Our first date back in September was pretty chill - drinks, walking around the city, talking about work and life for a few hours. We work in very similar, male-dominated, high-workload industries and even went to the same school, so we got along easily. At the end of the date, he asked when I’d be back in London. I said February, and he replied, “Then I’ll see you in February - I’ll take you to all my favorite places around the city.”

My trip ended up getting extended, and he wanted to see me again the following weekend. We grabbed drinks, he walked me back to my hotel, and we spent the night together. The next morning he went to work, but since I took that day off, he invited me to meet him near his office for lunch and coffee together. We didn't meet that night because he had to stay in the office until like 11pm to finish his work to take the day off the next day for me. The day after that, he took the day off work to show me around the city. 

On our last night together, he said things like, “If you come back around Christmas, I’ll take time off and take you to Christmas markets in Germany,” along with other sweet comments. He did ask me if I would move to the UK and I told him I wasn't sure and didn't have plans for now, since my life is based in North America. He did mention that he might switch jobs which would allow him to travel to NYC more often but life doesn't work out that easily so I never followed up on this matter afterwards.

After I came back to NYC, though, communication dropped off a lot. He did text me to wish me a safe flight and said “see you in February,” but that was pretty much it. I’ll admit I was a bit disappointed - I thought we had good chemistry and expected at least a bit more effort over text.

Because of that, I didn’t take things seriously and continued dating around, and I assume he did too. He would react to my Instagram stories pretty often but didn’t actually message me for a long time - until he mistakenly thought I was back in the UK for work in December. 

Now I have another work trip coming up soon. He asked if he could “reserve” all my days while I’m there. I do have work commitments, but I’m going early to combine it with PTO and will be spending 2–3 days with him. He’s again planning to take a day off work.I told him we could just meet on the weekends and that he didn’t have to take time off work (He is already low on PTO), but he was eager to take a day off anyway. He also said he could take additional days off if we wanted to spend more time together.

He also invited me to a formal dinner (he went to Oxford and apparently alumni can attend and bring guests) since we will be going there for a day trip.

I’m not sure how to interpret this overall. If it were purely casual, I wouldn’t expect someone to take time off work multiple times and invite me to go to a school dinner.

The fact I am alone is looked down on by so many more people because on my own the best I can do is just survive and even that feels begrudged.

I've CPTSD, autism, chronic illness that affects my diet, sleep and inflammation, I'm broke all the time, I barely own a bike, I'm stuck in rent hell, I know people think I'm a loser because there's no one else in my life or because I don't have the same cash flow or spending power as them and the fact I'm even typing this is proof I'm too messy. I'm seen as a burden and that's that.

I can clean, cook, mend, diy, second-hand, pay bills and show up on time but that's not enough. I've been to therapy and there's still all this emotion that feels like no other human being can handle and why should they have to?

Lesbian culture wants cute photos, nights out, fun and excitement, cars, trips abroad and I'm not 100% sure I've the mental capacity or stamina for it, without even talking about my wallet.

I've never thought having a partner would ""fix"" me but after so much time, I'm starting to believe that there's too much pain inside and the knowledge so many people have seen it and decided it was too much is slowly breaking me this week. 
That I wasnt any good at hiding it. 
That when people did see it, they rightfully dipped because even I feel like I'm carrying a black-hole of issues.
That there wasnt anything there worth keeping in touch with.

Even now I'm trying to intellectualise how awful this feels. Like I feel this is it. I'm just too much as I am to have a normal life, wife, kids, a family. Things I wanted so badly for so long but feel I need to let go because it's becoming impossible to imagine someone else supporting me or enjoying those things with me after this much time has passed.

Now I'm just trying to figure out what I do instead.

It’s something in your chest, a sense of unease, or maybe impeding doom, but it’s not strong yet, it’s still brewing, it’s still bearable, but you know that the minute you don’t breathe right, or you have a thought that scares you, this anxiety that’s been brewing transforms into a full blown panic attack.

Some Redditors were able to figure out my identity but were kind enough not to reveal it — thank you for that.

Over the last few days, I’ve been thinking about how to structure this in a way that genuinely helps young founders.

Many people reached out asking for help - How to register a company, how to start on Amazon, How to solve for capital, What to start, How to scale and many more.

I will be helping founders through calls and small in-person group meetings.

To be very clear:

\* I don’t want equity

\* I don’t charge any fees

\* I don’t want you to buy me coffee or anything else

I’m doing this purely out of genuine intent to help.

Back in Edinburgh I visited Origin Coffee Roasters (Great variety of fruity light roasts), Modern Standard Cafe (more medium roasted offerings), The Milkman (More of a cafe with huge lines that offers a small range of single origins) and The Source (Just amazing). I also made a day trip out to Stirling and visited Unorthodox Roasters.

Been wanting to get into espresso forever, so I bought a Nano to dip my toes in the water a bit before I dive in for real.

I've been making pour overs for the past year and I'm so used to that routine. I grind with the Fellow Ode 2.

I've seen some guides on the Nano online, but I'm still puzzled on exactly how to operate the device and how to make a good cup of coffee, i.e how much ml's of water, how many grams of beans to grind, grind setting (is it even possible on the Ode 2?). I've ordered a Kingrinder K6, so if you know the best grind setting with it, please tell! And then, should I preheat water into the basket - what temp?

1ql38kc,https://i.redd.it/gmc9p0fn06fg1.png,Jotaro | A Morning That Tastes Like Regret,"Your reputation on campus wasn’t bad, until you crossed paths with Jotaro Kujo.

He wasn’t the kind of guy people met so much as encountered. The Japanese marine biology student with a stare like a blade, the one who never talked unless he had to, who turned entire rooms silent just by existing. Rumor said he’d broken someone’s jaw his first month in London; rumor said he’d been expelled once already. No one really knew. What everyone did know was this: you didn’t mess with Jotaro Kujo.

Except you did. Constantly.  
Not because you were brave, but because you couldn’t help it. The dorm assignments put you together, and somehow, the more time you spent in that cramped room with him, the quiet breathing, the half-lit textbooks, the unspoken tension, the more you started talking. Teasing. Testing him. Watching him break his silence just to tell you to “shut the hell up.”

People noticed something strange. Jotaro didn’t ignore you like he did everyone else. He’d actually listen when you spoke. Sometimes he’d fix your lab reports without being asked. Sometimes he’d bring an extra coffee and leave it on your desk without comment. And when someone made a joke at your expense, he was the first to shut it down with a look. No one dared question it. Not even you.

Then came the night that changed everything. Loud, neon lights bleeding through fog, too much vodka, and that charged silence between you both finally snapping. You don’t remember who moved first, only the weight of him: heavy, deliberate, shaking with restraint he didn’t keep for long.

Now, the morning light cuts across the dorm room. His jacket’s on the floor. Your pulse won’t slow down. He’s awake beside you, half-turned, staring at the ceiling. For once, he doesn’t look like the unbreakable Jotaro Kujo everyone talks about.

He just looks… unsure.

And for the first time since you met him, you can tell he’s wondering the same thing you are... what the hell happens now.

The first one: we were talking about neighborhoods in our city and he said something like, “Okay so when we move in together we’ll need to pick somewhere between your job and mine.” I laughed because it sounded like a joke, but it also felt like… why are we even saying that on date one? Later we were talking about my sister’s kids (I brought it up because she kept texting me pics) and he goes, “Good, you already know how to handle toddlers, you’ll be ready when we have ours.” Again, he smiled like he was teasing. I did the polite laugh and changed the subject, but inside I got that little alarm bell feeling.

To be clear: he didn’t pressure me for anything physical, didn’t ask invasive stuff, didn’t say anything hateful, nothing like that. It’s more that those comments made me wonder if he’s the type to rush and get intense, or if this is just awkward flirting that landed wrong. I’ve dated someone before who started with “cute future talk” super early and it turned into love-bombing and controlling behavior later, so I might be sensitive. But I also don’t want to project my past onto a new person and punish him for making a dumb joke.

So what would you do? Do I bring it up before the second date (like over text) or in person? If I go on the second date, how do I respond if he says something like that again without sounding harsh? I’m trying to keep it light but also set a boundary like, hey we just met. Any scripts or wording that feels normal would help.

She has a stressful work environment, experiences a lot of traditional pressure in her family, and she suffers from severe PMDD and some form of anxiety. We both work full time, have no kids, and I manage daily domestic tasks like the cleaning, dishes and laundry. Having to do more around the house during these times is no issue for me especially if it means my wife gets to relax.

Unfortunately I am starting to feel resentful and emotional burnout from her relying on me, partially because I have no time for myself to recover. She relies on me to maintain emotional steadiness as she is prone to panic attacks, and feels unloved if I am not able to anticipate her mood changes. Although I ask frequently, she doesn't feel cared for if: I ask directly about her needs and she has to spell things out for me, if I'm not completely attuned to her mood and the situation. E.g. I cook breakfast every morning but didn't include enough protein for a meal while on her period. Although I have it typically marked on my calendar, she has gotten upset that I wasn't considerate of her.

I understand that she needs a lot of care and to continue supporting her I feel I need time to recharge, but conflict breaks out when I state that I would like to work out, spend some time with friends, or add to my professional development. I want to make some headway writing my new book which would require at least 3-5 hours a week of research, reading, or writing. I also care a lot about my fitness so I would like to fit in workouts \~2 hours a week. Most of these things can be completed from my home office and home gym. If I could schedule the occasional coffee to see some of my friends, that would be incredible for my mental health.

Unfortunately, this starts a lot of fights with her as she feels like I am taking away our couple time.

*I am looking for advice navigating conversations about personal time but I don't even know if the conflict I am experiencing is normal -- How often do you fight with your spouse? What's a reasonable compromise for time that you make in your relationship to make this work? Is there anything I can do to help navigate this and not be emotionally burnt out?*

**Current Barriers:**

\- **Hostility towards conversation**: My wife becomes hostile at the suggestion of me having personal time. Most conversations are perceived as me wanting to be away from her which results in an argument, or her becoming anxious or disappointed in the relationship.

\- **My wife values spending time in parallel**. For instance, she would like to wake up together on our days off, but we have different wake times and I might be awake a few hours before she is. If I am on my phone when she wakes up this turns into an argument. I can't leave bed before she wakes or she feels like she is left behind. I value her comfort it is important to me for her to feel loved, but I feel like she doesn't value my time the same way.

\- **She doesn't like to have separate hobbies** so we end up doing what she prefers

\- **Arguments are exhausting, explosive and can last 2-6 hours of a day, and sometimes 2-3 times a week**. There are so many triggers to our fights that it's almost unavoidable. Our fights are best described as anxious-avoidant dances. My wife becomes more aggressive and I tend to lose focus and disengage despite my best efforts to stay present. This results in her doubling down and becoming more anxious, then sometimes turns into a panic attack. After the fights, my wife experiences emotional hangovers that she feels are my responsibility to help her recover from in the days to follow.

It's important that I don't do anything to remind her of previous arguments, but the pile of triggers is mounting, the fights seem cumulative, and I feel like I'm slowly burning out trying to manage or avoid those triggers.

**Current Considerations:**

\- I suspect my wife might have a form of anxiety that she might need more support than I can provide, but she doesn’t open up to her friends and comes from a background where mental health is not discussed with family or community.

\- I am in weekly therapy to help learn how better to talk to her better, as to trigger her sadness less and hopefully have these conversations from a more regulated space on my end.

\- My wife and I attend therapy monthly and separately and I have suggested going to couples therapy but we are not attending at this time and are discussing returning.

\- My wife needed a lot of support prior to being married, but these fights started happening around our engagement. I assumed it was just wedding planning pressure.

TLDR: My wife \[32F\] and I \[37M\] fight for hours and I feel like I don’t have enough time in my marriage to do things for myself, recover from emotional burnout, and even be present in the relationship.",0,1769202623.0,marriageadvice,2,0.33,False

I just spent the day diving deep into preseedme today and shipped some stuff that actually moves the needle — from ""clunky prototype"" vibes to something that feels genuinely investable and fast.

Quick hits from today:

Slashed load times and nailed mobile responsiveness (no more embarrassing lag or zoom-fests)

Refactored types/libs — cleaner, future-proof, dev happiness up

Stripe integration refreshed and solid

Kicked off a full redesign of ""Create Pitch"" — cutting the VC-style fluff, focusing laser on what micro-investors scan in 10 seconds: real traction, milestones and momentum

Tomorrow: sharper founder-investor matching + clearing the bug/todo backlog.

We are really focused on few key things: public progress sharing, getting spotted by small angels, crowdfunding specific features without pitch-deck hell or gatekeepers. 



In short: Build in public, ship fast, stay independent.

Now's to y'all: What's the wildest/most cursed/actually-cool thing you're hacking this weekend?

Share here with the rest of us:

One punchy sentence on what it is + link if it's live

Screenshot or GIF of the progress/mess (those always explode the thread — before/afters, bugs, dashboards, whatever)

If you're stuck, want a brutal roast, UX feedback, pricing thoughts, or ""is this even worth it?"" — say the word, I'll give it straight

Imo, weekend builds are kinda magic when the energy's right. 



Let's swap some wins, roast the fails, and push each other to ship more as 2026 is the year for solo founders 👇

1ql31pi,https://www.reddit.com/r/JanitorsofUtah/comments/1ql31pi/which_ecofriendly_cleaning_products_are_effective/,Which Eco-Friendly Cleaning Products are Effective for Deep Office Cleanings?,"# The Benefits of Recurring Deep Office Cleanings

Recurring deep office cleanings with the use of eco-friendly products offers advantages that extend far beyond a spotless workspace. These benefits impact employee health, environmental sustainability, and business reputation.

**Health & Wellness**

The health advantages of regular deep cleanings with eco-friendly products are substantial. Traditional cleaning products often contain harsh chemicals that release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air, contributing to poor indoor air quality. In contrast, green cleaning solutions significantly improve the air your employees breathe every day. By eliminating allergens, dust mites, mold spores, and bacteria from carpets, upholstery, and hard-to-reach areas, deep cleanings reduce respiratory issues and allergic reactions among staff.

Lower chemical exposure is another critical health benefit. Employees are no longer exposed to the harsh fumes and residues left behind by conventional cleaners. This reduction in toxic exposure can lead to fewer headaches, skin irritations, and respiratory complaints. Studies have shown that offices with better air quality and cleaner environments experience decreased sick days and[ boosted productivity](https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/office-air-quality-may-affect-employees-cognition-productivity/), which translates to reduced healthcare costs for employers.

**Environmental**

Choosing eco-friendly cleaning products for your deep office cleanings demonstrates a genuine commitment to a healthier environment. Green cleaning solutions are formulated with biodegradable ingredients that break down naturally without harming ecosystems. When these products enter water systems through drains, they don’t contribute to the pollution of rivers, lakes, and oceans like their chemical-laden counterparts.

Many eco-friendly cleaning products also come in sustainable packaging, often using recycled materials and concentrates that reduce plastic waste. By selecting these products, your office reduces its carbon footprint—a crucial step in combating climate change. Additionally, if your building is pursuing or maintaining LEED certification or other green building standards, using eco-friendly cleaning products and practices is often a requirement that can help you achieve or maintain that prestigious status.

**Professional & Business**

The visual and atmospheric impact of a deeply cleaned office cannot be overstated. When clients, partners, or potential employees walk into your workspace, they immediately notice cleanliness. A pristine, fresh-smelling office that doesn’t reek of harsh chemicals creates a positive first impression and reinforces your company’s professional image.

Your commitment to sustainable workplace practices also enhances your brand reputation. Today’s consumers and top talent increasingly choose to work with and for companies that demonstrate environmental responsibility. Employee morale and productivity naturally improve in clean, healthy environments where people feel their wellbeing is valued. A workspace free from chemical odors and allergens is simply more pleasant, allowing employees to focus on their work rather than discomfort or health concerns.

**Cost-Effectiveness Over Time**

While some eco-friendly cleaning products may have a slightly higher upfront cost, recurring deep cleanings prove remarkably cost-effective over time. Regular deep cleaning prevents the buildup of dirt, grime, and stains that can become permanent if left untreated. 

Clean HVAC systems and air ducts (achieved through proper deep cleaning) also operate more efficiently, reducing energy costs. When you factor in reduced employee sick days, lower turnover due to improved workplace satisfaction, and avoided replacement costs for office furnishings, the return on investment for recurring eco-friendly deep cleanings becomes clear and compelling.

# Eco-Friendly Cleaning Products that are Most Effective

Understanding which specific eco-friendly cleaning products deliver professional-grade results for deep office cleanings is essential for making informed purchasing decisions. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of the most effective green cleaning solutions by category.

**All-Purpose Cleaners**

Reading labels carefully is essential for selecting products that truly support eco-friendly deep office cleaning efforts.

Plant-based multi-surface cleaners form the foundation of any eco-friendly deep cleaning arsenal. These versatile products use natural soaps derived from coconuts, corn, or other plants to break down dirt and grime on any surface. Look for all-purpose cleaners with EPA Safer Choice certification, which indicates the product meets stringent safety and environmental standards.

The most effective eco-friendly all-purpose cleaners contain ingredients like citric acid (from citrus fruits), which cuts through grease and soap scum, and plant-based enzymes that break down organic matter. [Green Seal and EcoLogo certifications are additional markers of quality and environmental responsibility.](https://greenseal.org/standards/gs-37-cleaning-products-for-industrial-and-institutional-use/) These cleaners work exceptionally well on desks, countertops, walls, doors, and other hard surfaces throughout your office, making them indispensable for deep cleaning tasks.

**Floor Cleaning Solutions**

Different flooring types require specialized approaches, and fortunately, eco-friendly options exist for every surface in your office. For hardwood floors, seek plant-based cleaners that are pH-neutral to avoid damaging the wood’s finish. These products typically contain natural oils that clean while adding a protective layer and subtle shine.

Carpet cleaning presents unique challenges, but low-moisture, plant-based carpet cleaners have proven highly effective for deep cleaning. These products often use natural enzymes to break down stains and odors at the molecular level, eliminating them rather than just masking them. They’re particularly effective for high-traffic areas and can tackle everything from coffee spills to tracked-in dirt.

For tile and grout, look for eco-friendly cleaners containing natural acids and oxygen-based bleaching agents. These products effectively remove built-up grime and mildew without the harsh fumes associated with chlorine bleach, restoring tile surfaces to their original appearance.

**Glass & Window Cleaners**

Achieving streak-free shine without ammonia-based products is entirely possible with modern eco-friendly glass cleaners. The most effective formulations use plant-based alcohols and natural surfactants to cut through fingerprints, smudges, and dust. Vinegar-based solutions remain popular for their effectiveness and low cost, though commercial eco-friendly glass cleaners often add ingredients that reduce streaking and speed drying time.

These products work beautifully on windows, glass doors, mirrors, and even computer monitors and glass whiteboards, leaving surfaces sparkling without toxic fumes that can irritate eyes and respiratory systems.

**Disinfectants & Sanitizers**

Perhaps the category where people have the most skepticism about green products, eco-friendly disinfectants have proven they can kill germs as effectively as traditional chemical disinfectants. EPA-registered botanical disinfectants use plant-derived ingredients like thymol (from thyme oil) or citric acid to eliminate bacteria and viruses. These products meet EPA standards for disinfection while avoiding harsh chemicals like quaternary ammonium compounds.

Hydrogen peroxide-based cleaners offer another excellent eco-friendly disinfection option. Hydrogen peroxide breaks down into water and oxygen, leaving no harmful residues. These products effectively kill a broad spectrum of pathogens and are particularly useful in restrooms, break rooms, and other high-touch areas.

Essential oil-based sanitizers, while not always EPA-registered as disinfectants, can provide additional antimicrobial benefits and pleasant natural scents. Tea tree oil, eucalyptus, and lavender essential oils all have documented antimicrobial properties and can be incorporated into cleaning routines for added protection.

**Specialty Deep Cleaning Products**

Deep office cleanings require specialized products for specific challenges. For upholstery cleaning, enzyme-based eco-friendly cleaners excel at removing deep-set stains and odors from office chairs, sofas, and fabric partitions. These products work by breaking down the proteins in stains, making them easier to lift from fabric fibers.

Kitchen and break room areas often require degreasing agents capable of handling baked-on food and oily residues. Plant-based degreasers using ingredients like d-limonene (derived from citrus peels) cut through grease as effectively as petroleum-based products without the harsh chemical smell or environmental impact.

Bathroom and restroom cleaners designed for eco-friendly deep cleaning combine natural acids, plant-based surfactants, and essential oils to tackle soap scum, hard water deposits, and organic matter. These products leave restrooms fresh and sanitary without chlorine, ammonia, or synthetic fragrances.

For air duct and HVAC system cleaning, specialized eco-friendly solutions help remove dust, mold, and debris that accumulate in ventilation systems. Clean air ducts improve air quality throughout the office and increase HVAC efficiency.

**Key Certifications and Ingredients to Look For**

When selecting eco-friendly cleaning products for deep office cleanings, certifications provide assurance that products meet rigorous environmental and safety standards. Green Seal Certified products have been independently verified to meet strict performance and environmental criteria. EPA Safer Choice products contain ingredients that are safer for human health and the environment. USDA Certified Biobased products contain a verified percentage of renewable biological ingredients.

In terms of ingredients, the most effective eco-friendly products contain plant-based surfactants (cleaning agents), natural enzymes that break down organic matter, and essential oils that provide antimicrobial properties and pleasant scents. Products should be free from phosphates (which pollute waterways), chlorine bleach (which creates toxic fumes), synthetic fragrances (which contain hidden chemicals), and high levels of VOCs (which contribute to indoor air pollution).

Reading ingredient labels carefully and choosing products with third-party certifications ensures you’re getting genuinely eco-friendly products that will deliver professional deep cleaning results.

1ql2zh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1ql2zh7/new_ssv_who_hasnt_worked_at_a_starbucks_in_four/,New SSV who hasn't worked at a Starbucks in four years...,"**TLDR:** How should I approach a new job as a shift supervisor if it's been years since I've worked at a Starbucks?

**Long version:** I put myself through college as a barista (two contracted Starbucks locations and two local coffee shops) and was an assistant store manager at both local coffee shops. I ended up going into social services after college and worked at a state prison where I trained and managed other staff. 

I recently had to move, so I'm trying to find a new job as quickly as I can. I ended up applying to my local Starbucks as a shift supervisor since I have management experience, but it's been about four years since I last worked at a Starbucks, so I'm really rusty on how everything runs. (Also, ya know... lots has happened in the last four years in Starbucks world, so there's plenty of new stuff to learn, lmao)

I'm a fast learner, but I know I'm not going to be up to par with the rest of the staff for the first few weeks.

My two questions:

* Is it expected for SSVs to be able to jump right in, or is it typical for them to have some sort of ""training"" period?
* Baristas - if I were your shift supervisor, how would you (ideally) want me to approach the job and my supervising duties during my first few weeks?",1,1769202388.0,starbucks,1,1.0,False
1ql2zew,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1ql2zew/why_boredom_is_your_brains_ultimate_superpower/,Why Boredom is Your Brain's Ultimate Superpower (Science-Based Guide),"We're all terrified of being bored. The second there's a lull, out comes the phone. waiting in line? scroll. commercial break? scroll. slightly awkward silence? You guessed it. 

But here's what nobody's telling you: that constant stimulation is literally rewiring your brain to need distraction. I've spent the last few months deep diving into neuroscience research, interviewing productivity experts, and reading everything from neuroscientist Andrew Huberman's work to Cal Newport's studies on attention. Turns out, boredom isn't the enemy. itIt'sctually the closest thing we have to a mental superpower.

Your brain on boredom is like your brain on steroids. When you're not doing anything, your default mode network kicks in. This is where creativity happens, where problem-solving occurs, where you actually process your life instead of just consuming everyone else's. But we've become so uncomfortable with our own thoughts that we'd rather scroll through strangers' vacation photos than sit with ourselves for five minutes.

Here's what happens when you embrace boredom:

Your creativity actually comes back.

The research is pretty detailed on this. Boredom activates the default mode network, which is basically your brain's creative engine. Dr Drandi Mann at University of Central Lancashire found that people who were bored before a creativity task performed significantly better than those who weren't. Your best ideas don't come from another productivity hack or motivational video. They come from staring at the ceiling.

I started implementing ""boredom blocks"" into my routine. 20 minutes of just sitting. no phone, no book, nothing. The first week was brutal. My brain was screaming for stimulation. But around week three, something shifted. The idea started flooding in. Problems I'deen stuck on suddenly had solutions. It felt like my brain was finally online again.

Dopamine detox is real, just not how TikTok sells it

Dr Dranna Lembke's book ""Dopamine Nation"" is genuinely life-changing, not in a cheesy self-help way but in a ""holy shit this explains everything"" way. She's a psychiatrist at Stanford and breaks down how our constant pursuit of pleasure is making us miserable. Every scroll, every notification, every instant gratification hit is flooding your brain with dopamine. Andike any drug, you need more and more to feel normal.

The solution isn't some extreme 30-day Detox. It's strategic boredom. Let yourself be understimulated. Take walks without podcasts. Eat without screens. drive without music sometimes. Your rain will protest hard at first because it's used to constant hits, but this recalibration is how you get your motivation back for things that actually matter.

Your attention span isn't dead, it's just been hijacked

Cal Newport's ""Deep Work"" changed how I think about focus entirely. He's a computer science professor at Georgetown who's studied attention and productivity for years. The main insight: your brain is capable of intense focus, but you've trained it to expect interruptions every few minutes. 

Tech companies employ literal neuroscientists to make their apps as addictive as possible. You're not weak willed. You're up against billion-dollar algorithms designed to exploit your psychology. But you can retrain your attention. start small. 25 minutes of focused work, no phone in sight. iIt'llfeel impossible at first. That's normal. gradually increase. I'm used to 90-minute blocks now, nd the amount of actual work I let done is insane compared to my old scattered approach.

Boredom builds self-awareness

Johann Hari's ""Stolen Focus"" absolutely wrecked me. He spent three months researching why we can't pay attention anymore, nd the findings are pretty confronting. When you're constantly distracted, you never have to confront uncomfortable thoughts or feelings. You're basically running from yourself.

Sitting in boredom forces you to face what's actually going on in your head. yeah it's uncomfortable. That's the point. You're noticing patterns, rerecognising that actually makes you happy versus what just kills time, understanding what you're avoiding. This isn't therapy speak; this is practical self-knowledge that changes how you make decisions.

How to actually do this without losing your mind

Start stupidly small. Pick one activity per day, where you don't reach for your phone. Morning coffee. commute. before bed. Just one thing. Notice the discomfort, but don't give in. Your brain will literally feel like it's dying of boredom. It's not.

Deletes social media apps from your phone b, but keep them on your computer. This tiny bit of friction makes mindless scrolling way less automatic. You can still use them, just intentionally.

Thepp ""one sec"" is genuinely useful. itItdds a breathing exercise before opening social apps. sounds gimmicky b, but that pause is often enough to make you rerealiseou don't actually want to scroll, you're just bored.

There's also [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) an AI learning app that turns knowledge from books, research papers, and expert talks into personalised audio. If you want a genuinely engaging alternative to mindless scrolling, it pulls from sources like the books mentioned above and creates content that fits your exact interests. You control the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The options are surprisingly addictive; there's even a smoky, Samantha-from-Her style voice that makes listening feel less like work. It's basically designed to replace doomscrolling with something that actually sticks in your brain.

Create"" stimulation-free zones"" in your day. Mine: first hour after waking up, any meal I'm mating alone, last hour before bed. No screens during these times. was brutal at first. Now it's when I feel most like myself.

Keep a small notebook nearby during boredom blocks. Whenideas come (and they will), jot them down. This isn't breaking the boredom; it's capturing what it produces.

The comfortable truth is that most of our ""productivity"" is just elaborate distraction. Checking mail 40 times a day isn't working; it's avoiding work. Listening to three podcasts simultaneously isn't learning, it's information hoarding. scrolling motivational content isn't improving, it's postponing improvement.

Bored like wasting time because we've been conditioned to believe every second needs to be optimised, but your brain needs space to process, to wander, to be understimulated. That's ot wasting time. That shows humans have generated every worthwhile idea in history.

You don't need another productivity system or morning routine. You need to be bored more. uncomfortable as hell, but that's where your actual brain lives.

I just spent the day diving deep into [www.preseedme.com](http://www.preseedme.com) today and shipped some stuff that actually moves the needle — from ""clunky prototype"" vibes to something that feels genuinely investable and fast.

Quick hits from today:

* Slashed load times and nailed mobile responsiveness (no more embarrassing lag or zoom-fests)
* Refactored types/libs — cleaner, future-proof, dev happiness up
* Stripe integration refreshed and solid
* Kicked off a full redesign of ""Create Pitch"" — cutting the VC-style fluff, focusing laser on what micro-investors scan in 10 seconds: real traction, milestones and momentum

Tomorrow: sharper founder-investor matching + clearing the bug/todo backlog.

We are really focused on few key things: public progress sharing, getting spotted by small angels, crowdfunding specific features without pitch-deck hell or gatekeepers.   
  
In short: Build in public, ship fast, stay independent.

Now's to y'all: What's the wildest/most cursed/actually-cool thing you're hacking this weekend?

Share here with the rest of us:

* One punchy sentence on what it is + link if it's live
* Screenshot or GIF of the progress/mess (those always explode the thread — before/afters, bugs, dashboards, whatever)
* If you're stuck, want a brutal roast, UX feedback, pricing thoughts, or ""is this even worth it?"" — say the word, I'll give it straight

Imo, weekend builds are kinda magic when the energy's right.   
  
Let's swap some wins, roast the fails, and push each other to ship more as 2026 is the year for solo founders 👇

Hurricane,Utah 
Friday, March 15, 2024 
6:00 a.m

It was the beginning of another day in the famous city of Hurricane. Sunlight softly reflected off the old vintage buildings as people hurried out of their homes toward work, and the neon signs of restaurants and diners flickered off one by one.
In the old suburbs of the city, in a quiet and cozy neighborhood, stood an old house—large, yet with a welcoming appearance.

In one of the rooms of this house, where sunlight delicately filtered through the curtains, the space was filled with posters and vintage objects. There, Emilly slept deeply in her bed, surrounded by stuffed animals and cozy blankets. Then, the persistent sound of the alarm clock echoed through the room, accompanied by the meow of Kitty, her black cat, waiting outside the window.
The young woman finally opened her eyes and reached out to turn off the alarm.

—Okay, okay… I’m awake, Kitty— murmured Emilly, her voice still heavy with sleep, as she stroked the cat’s head.

She slowly sat up in bed, her long, voluminous golden hair cascading over her shoulders. She picked up her phone from the nightstand to check her reminders and realized she had a meeting scheduled in two hours at the famous Freddy's Family Dinner.

—I still can’t believe I got an offer from such a big company like Fazbear Entertainment. I wonder what the owner himself wants to talk to me about— Emilly wondered aloud, a mix of curiosity and anxiety in her voice.

She then slowly got up and walked to the bathroom to get ready and take her medication.
For several long minutes, Emilly stared at her reflection in the mirror. The scars on her body drew attention—deep, irregular, unpleasant marks spread across nearly all her skin, except her face. They were silent reminders of a past she couldn’t fully recall and one of the main reasons she had suffered bullying at the old psychiatric orphanage where she had lived before finally leaving upon turning eighteen.

These thoughts began to fade when Kitty started rubbing around her legs, purring softly.
—Are you hungry, Kitty? I’ll put your food out in a moment, little glutton. I have a feeling today’s going to be a very long day— said Emilly, letting out a small smile after swallowing her last pills.



Freddy's Family Dinner 
Friday,March 15, 2024
7:50 a.m.

The day was sunny with only a few clouds in the sky. Emilly rode her small red scooter unhurriedly toward the famous Freddy's Family Dinner, still lost in thought about the email she had received from William Terrence Afton, the current owner of Fazbear Entertainment, a few days earlier. Of course, he was one of the four original co-founders of the company, alongside Henry Joel Emily, Edwin Davis Murray, and Fiona Margaret Murray. Yet, deep inside, Emilly felt an overwhelming discomfort mixed with fear whenever she saw or read about Mr. Afton.

She had often heard stories from some of the town’s older residents about the tragedies and incidents that had occurred at the company’s establishments during the seventies, eighties, and nineties—ranging from disappearances and murders of children and employees to bodies found inside animatronic suits. Although the police never caught the culprit, these cases were quietly shelved due to lack of evidence and company bribery. Over time, they gave rise to urban legends and rumors that the restaurants were haunted, though eventually, these tragedies were mostly forgotten, remembered only as tales to scare children.

As she thought about this, Emilly finally caught sight of the façade of the famous Freddy's Family Dinner, one of the many company restaurants still standing since the eighties. She parked her scooter in the crowded lot, despite it still being early. She looked toward the entrance and saw a crowd of people, mostly children, entering the massive building alongside their parents, wide smiles painted on their faces.

—What could be so special about this place?— Emilly wondered as she stepped inside the restaurant. Upon entering, she noticed a large reception area where a familiar old face stood behind the counter. Wearing the restaurant’s caricatured security uniform was Mike Schmidt, an old high school friend Emilly hadn’t seen in years.
—Mikey? Is that you?— Emilly asked.

—Emilly? Wow, what a surprise! It’s been ages since high school. How are you? Are you still in photojournalism and working as a freelance reporter?— Mike said, surprised to see her, despite his tired face, seemingly trying his hardest to stay awake while on the job.

—Yes, I am. I got an offer to work on a documentary and some reporting here, and I’m heading now to meet the owner himself. By the way, do you know where Mr. Afton might be?— Emilly asked.

Mike looked at Emilly with a weary expression and pointed in a direction.

—Ah, my boss… well, his office is backstage. I’ll ask Ness to help you since… I’m way too busy— Mike said.

—That won’t be necessary, Mike. I’m already here— said a voice. Suddenly, a man with a friendly appearance appeared, wearing glasses and a yellow bunny pin, accompanied by a young woman with pink and purple streaked hair tied in a ponytail, dressed in a security uniform like Mike.

—Ah, Vanessa, you brought your dad. I was just about to ask you to help Emilly find him— Mike said, returning to his work.

Vanessa nodded slightly, a faint smile on her lips, while William adjusted his glasses.

—Miss Emilly, it is a pleasure to finally meet you in person. I hope your trip here was pleasant— he said, extending his hand.

—It was fine, Mr. Afton— Emilly replied, shaking his hand while trying to mask the immense discomfort and fear growing inside her.

—Well, we have much to discuss, don’t we? Let’s go to my office, away from the noise— he said, gesturing for Emilly to follow him.
Emilly nodded and followed.

They passed through internal corridors where the sound of children laughing and cheerful music gradually gave way to a strange silence, broken only by the distant hum of machinery and the soft creak of the old floor. The walls were adorned with vintage Fazbear Entertainment posters—smiling mascots with unnaturally large eyes frozen in artificial poses.

For a brief moment, Emilly had the unsettling sensation that those eyes were following her.
William stopped in front of a wooden door and opened it.

—Please, make yourself comfortable. I believe this conversation will be very productive— he said with a polite smile.

Freddy's Family Dinner, Management Office
Friday, March 15, 2024
8:10 a.m.

The room was silent. Emilly sat in a chair, facing William, who was sipping a bit of coffee.
—Well, I suppose you’ve seen the email I sent you, haven’t you?— the man asked.

—Yes, I saw it a few days ago, but tell me, Mr. Afton… why would such a large and famous company like yours want a documentary and promotion produced by a small company like mine?— Emilly asked.

William let out a soft laugh and turned his gaze toward the window, observing the distant activity of the restaurant.

—To be honest with you, my young lady, I don’t trust these big media companies. They always find a way to twist everything involving Fazbear Entertainment, and it’s extremely difficult to disprove those lies once they spread. That’s why I’m looking for someone fair, competent… and with true journalistic talent. Someone like you— William replied.

Emilly took a deep breath.

—I see. So what exactly do you expect from me? A documentary? A promotional video? Or something beyond that?— Emilly asked.
William smiled. He then opened one of the drawers of his desk and pulled out a yellow envelope, which he carefully placed in front of her.

—Here is everything you need to know. I want a full documentary and a promotional video. In this document, I’ve listed the areas of the restaurant you may film and photograph… oh, and I also included the payment amount and the period you may stay with the company— the man said.

Emilly looked at the document and was quite surprised to see an incredibly high sum of money—enough to buy a larger studio, a team of professionals, and high-quality equipment. On top of that, the time frame was ten months. An offer impossible to refuse.

—So, Mrs. Campbell, do you accept the job?— William asked, extending his hand.

—You can count on me, Mr. Afton. I’ll give my best to create the documentary and promotional video— Emilly said, shaking his hand. William’s expression showed satisfaction at her response.

—Then welcome to our family. You’ll begin your work tomorrow night, as it’s the only time the restaurant isn’t busy— William said.
Emilly nodded, gathering the documents and standing up from the chair.

As she left the office, she had the strange sensation that the moment the door closed behind her, an unusual chill began to creep over her.
William Afton remained seated, watching the
closed door, his coffee slowly cooling on the table.

A subtle smile formed on his lips.

—Oh… this is going to be very fun— the man murmured.

I’ve got a Gaggia classic pro since a long while, and have been tinkering and experimenting with it for a while, including changing the stock double basket for an IMS competition in search of better coffee extraction by using a ridge less basket with higher volume for increased doses of ground coffee, but instead of making it easier, its now even more complicated to calibrate my shots and I need to grind extra fine to even get palatable shots, with a small variance on my puck prep resulting in unpalatable shots. I’m looking forward to getting a no fuss ridgeless basket for good tasting coffee, without needing to perfect my prep to obtain extraordinary shots. For consideration I moded the machine to exchange the OPV spring to the 6 bar one, but am open to return to a 8 bar one if recommended based on your tips. I also have a Baratza Encore ESP as my grinder, and tend to use single origin specialty medium roast coffee for my espresso based drinks.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and/or made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay inspired by ""Bride's story"" :3)

**About me:**

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling.

1ql2hif,https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/1ql2hif/breaking_news_developing_story_hell_freezes_over/,"🔴 BREAKING NEWS | DEVELOPING STORY HELL FREEZES OVER (PENDING): WASHINGTON, D.C. BRACES FOR MOAS City Officials Warn of Possible “Mother of All Snowstorms”","MOAS System Nears Capital

WASHINGTON, D.C. Republicans and Democrats are quietly preparing for a powerful winter storm expected to arrive later today, even as both sides publicly insist they are handling the situation separately and without coordination.

Behind the scenes, there are signs of unease. Neither party is sharing details of its contingency plans, and aides on both sides have declined to discuss internal preparations. Still, whispers are circulating through Capitol offices that something unusual is being discussed, something rarely associated with survival planning in Washington.

According to multiple people familiar with the matter, there has been a leak involving internal preparations. Those discussions reportedly include the possibility of spending extended periods in close proximity with members of the opposing party if conditions worsen. If confirmed, the conversations would represent an unusual departure from normal practice in Washington, driven by circumstances rather than coordination. Lawmakers who invested in the US Markets still agree on GME with some with additional interest in GME-ws.

Meteorologists say the storm’s leading edge is approaching the Mid-Atlantic, bringing a mix of snow, sleet, freezing rain, and prolonged cold. One unnamed weather person said "",,,unprecedented cold. Appropriate cold however for the area such as Washington DC itself.""  City officials say the overall setup has raised internal concerns that the system could escalate into what they are now calling the MOAS.

A senior Republican lawmaker, speaking privately, said the situation was being taken seriously.

“We’ve seen snow before,” the lawmaker said. “But this one’s being described in ways that make people start looking around the room and asking where they’re supposed to be if things go sideways.”

CITY RESPONSE: MOAS declared, details unclear

City officials, city maintenance crews, and highway operations managers in Washington, D.C. issued a joint statement Friday describing the approaching system as a potential “Mother of All Snowstorms,” or MOAS.

The statement said preparations are underway for a wide range of scenarios, including several that do not align neatly with one another. Officials said forecasts may be upgraded, downgraded, or remain neutral as conditions develop, and acknowledged that clearer guidance is expected only after the storm begins.

Officials said crews are ready, equipment has been staged, and routes have been identified, adding that plans remain subject to change.

An official close to the response effort, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the preparations look orderly on paper but warned that once conditions deteriorate, “it’s going to turn into the usual situation where everyone is moving at the same time, in different directions, for reasons that won’t be clear until afterward.” 

GameStop investors are not adversely affected due to what officials described as ""Diamond Hands"".

What’s Expected if the MOAS Materializes

Forecast models place the capital in a transition zone where snow is expected to mix with sleet and freezing rain, a combination officials say has preceded past storms that later earned outsized reputations.

Officials anticipate snow accumulation followed by ice forming on road surfaces, temperatures remaining below freezing throughout the event, limited daytime melting, and reduced effectiveness of road treatments.

Forecasters have compared the setup to Snowmageddon in 2010 and the Blizzard of 2016, with similarities to 1996, when timing and weather combined to shut down large portions of the city.

EARLY ACTIVITY ACROSS THE CITY

Although the storm itself has not yet arrived, preparations associated with a potential MOAS are already visible.

Road crews have begun pre-treating major routes. Federal agencies are preparing telework notices. Transit authorities are warning of possible service changes. Residents have begun stocking up on basic supplies.

One city employee described the atmosphere as calm, with an understanding that conditions could change quickly.

GOVERNMENT PREPARES

Inside federal buildings, contingency plans are being reviewed and equipment checked. Cold-weather procedures are being revisited. Schedules are being adjusted.

Congressional aides confirmed lawmakers are discussing early departures and remote work options.

A senior official involved in federal emergency preparedness, speaking on background, described expectations bluntly.

“We’ve got plans, we’ve got backups, and we’ve got backups for the backups,” the official said. “After that, it usually turns into people asking who’s in charge, realizing they thought someone else was in charge, and then waiting to see what happens.”

Any cooperation that emerges is expected to be brief and situational, prompted more by circumstances than conviction.

A Democratic lawmaker, asked about coordination during the storm, framed priorities more narrowly.

“If there’s coffee and heat, people will manage,” the lawmaker said. “Everything else is going to be extremely tedious and very temporary.”

POLITICAL NOISE EXPECTED TO DIM

Observers are also watching for a possible slowdown in public political activity as the storm approaches.

Some analysts suggest the MOAS designation alone may temporarily reduce routine political commentary, including a quieter public presence from Donald  as weather conditions affect travel, schedules, and access.

Some aides joked privately that if conditions improve, the quiet could quickly give way to a “MOAST” — the Mother of All Social Tempests — a sudden return of posts once fingers thaw and batteries recharge.

INFRASTRUCTURE UNDER WATCH

Officials say ice remains the primary concern if the storm develops as feared.

Hazardous road conditions, transit delays, airport disruptions, and localized power issues are possible. Emergency services are expected to remain operational.

Salt trucks are positioned. Conditions will determine next steps.

WHAT COMES NEXT

The storm is expected to intensify overnight, with the most severe conditions likely late Saturday into Sunday. Officials are urging residents to prepare for limited travel and prolonged cold.

As one longtime resident said, “They’re calling it the MOAS now. That’s usually when things start getting interesting.”

1ql2gn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1ql2gn3/feeling_so_god_awful/,Feeling so god awful,"Hi everyone I just need to get this out because I feel like my skin is crawling and that I’m going to be sick.

I was either a little hypomanic or doing well last week. I felt so good and not over the top. I thought things had finally changed and I was even proud of myself for working hard to feel better. 

Now I feel like the world has come crumbling down. I feel this intense anxiety for a lot of my day (thankfully not all day) and it makes me feel so sick. I’ve experienced anxiety a lot but never felt anxiety at such debilitating level and it’s mixed with wanting to just jump out of my skin and a sinking feeling, like impending doom is approaching.

I feel so fucking sad as well. I’ve got things in my life to be sad about so some of it makes sense but at the same time I keep feeling like it’s over dramatic sad. Like I’ve mentioned in previous posts my dad’s terminal but isn’t doing the worst at the moment, like he’s not great but he’s been worse. My kitten Eevee who I love with all my heart and is the only reason I get up each morning had a bad rare reaction to her vaccination and hasn’t been overly well but is a lot more like herself now so I’m grateful for that but still anxious about her, my boss has been really horrible to me lately and things are messy because she was one of my best friends before she got me a job and it’s making work really hard and I really love my job for the most part, I had a date lined up that I made when I was doing well or hypomanic whatever you want to call it and I was still looking forward to it but I’ve been ghosted which has made me feel super unloveable. 

I’m unable to clean my room properly but determined to do it because of my kitten and it’s not actually that bad but I’m usually tidy because it helps keep my head clear, showering? That’s like pulling teeth and teeth? Well that’s even harder to take care of. I stopped working out and I’m now struggling to do anything other than do some tiny tasks around caring for Eevee. 

I’m also hearing an accumulation of voices which I know aren’t real so I don’t think it’s concerning and maybe voices aren’t the best way to describe it because I’m assuming and trying to be logical here it must be my inner critic and it’s my own voice, but it feels like other people’s all at once or taking turns talking to me. For example I was making a coffee this morning and I usually put on a song while I wait for the jug/kettle to boil and I had to chose a certain song or these voices would start judging me. I feel watched by them a lot of the time, they aren’t there all the time but when they do I feel like they are outside of me just judging and watching everything I do. I start curating my music to quiet them down or I will do whatever I’m doing but feel deep shame because I’ve “done it wrong” or “that’s embarrassing”. I just feel so much shame when these voices are around like I’m being pointed at and laughed at by something that’s not real but feels it. 

I don’t feel like I can reach out to my therapist outside of session in fear I’m going to be a burden or it’s not appropriate and it’s boundary crossing so I’m just holding tight until my next session but I am struggling so so much. I just can’t stand this feeling that everything is crumbling over me. It’s like I’m one more event away from a massive breakdown and I can’t afford that right now. I feel so trapped in my own body. I feel like everything’s going wrong and all I see is bad shit everywhere I look. I can’t escape.

I've felt a pulse return under my fingers after five minutes of compressions that tore my shoulder apart. I've heard the first breath after ROSC and knew the real fight was just starting.

Then I go home. Turn on Netflix. Some actor in a spotless white coat brings someone back to life with a defibrillator and a speech.

Not how it works.

**The defibrillator scene.**

Every medical drama does it. Patient flatlines. Someone yells ""Clear!"" They shock. Body arches off the bed. Heart restarts. Everyone cheers.

Twenty years in the ER. Never seen a defibrillator restart a flatlined heart. Not once. You can't shock asystole. Flatline means no electrical activity to interrupt. Shocking it is like hitting a dead engine with a sledgehammer. Makes noise. Doesn't start anything.

Defibrillator stops chaos. VFib, pulseless VTach. Resets a rhythm that still has electrical activity. That's the job.

Monitor flatlines in real life? Movie ends. Work starts.

I lock my elbows. Plant my hands on the sternum. Drive compressions until my forearms cramp and my shoulder burns deep. Ribs crack under my palms. Chest gets softer. Sound changes. Nobody says it out loud. Everyone hears it.

Not heroic. Sweat and plastic and stale coffee you swallowed too fast. Counting compressions. Waiting for the next rhythm check like it's a verdict.

Most of the time they don't come back. The ones who do? No gasping. No ""thank you, doctor."" Broken ribs, brain damage, tube down the throat.

**Blood loss on screen is a joke.**

Action movies love the shoulder wound. Hero gets shot. Winces. Makes a joke. Keeps fighting like adrenaline turned him into a god.

Blood loss makes you malfunction. Not superhuman.

I've held pressure on a femoral bleed while the patient asked why the room was spinning. Skin paper white. Lips blue gray. Pupils blown wide. Pressure dropping like an elevator with cut cables. He didn't ask for morphine. Asked why his fingers felt like static.

That's blood loss. Not grit. Not one liners.

Coordination goes. Speech goes. Then the weird calm where the body stops negotiating and starts shutting down.

Blood is the system. When it leaves, everything else follows. Second wind doesn't replace red cells pooling on the floor.

**Death doesn't look like the movies.**

Hollywood loves dignified death. Pale face. Peaceful expression. Eyes closed like they chose sleep.

Death strips control in seconds. Mouth falls open, jaw goes slack. Sphincters release. Bladder, bowels, everything the body held for decades. Gone.

Smell starts immediately. Metallic. Organic. Wrong. Gets into your scrubs, under your nails, into your hair. Twenty minute shower doesn't touch it. Three days later you're eating lunch and you taste it again. Stomach flips.

Movies cut away. Not pretty. Doesn't sell tickets.

No dignity in the body quitting. Just the fact that the machine stopped.

**What I'm done with.**

Families watch Grey's Anatomy. Come in thinking they know how this works.

I explain CPR doesn't work like TV. Most don't listen.

Family members demand we shock their ninety year old grandmother's flatline. Saw it on House. Doesn't matter that it's bullshit. They want what they saw.

Hollywood makes it look clean and heroic. Spotless scrubs. Perfect saves.

Real version is brutal. Most of the time we lose.

Actors play nurses who never miss a vein. Never break ribs. Never lose a patient. Never go home and cry in the shower.

Twelve hour shift. Couldn't save someone. Come home. Turn on the TV. Fake doctor saves everyone with a speech and a shock.

Not like that.

Never like that.

1ql2dvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1ql2dvc/hello_part_2/,Hello? (Part 2.),"Chapter 3: The Journey to the Cabin.

I set out on my hike to the cabin. The pull along cart I was given, well. it wasn’t the best, but it worked. It had an awkward handle to hold on to, that made a little difficult to pull. but thankfully it had big wheels and handled the weight of a year’s worth of supplies without much issue. But could be better. The trail was mostly flat and smooth, nothing too challenging yet. Thankfully.

From the station to the cabin, I had about a five hour hike ahead, giving me a chance to preview the area I’d patrol.

A nice introduction to everything.

I passed a few small creeks Rich had mentioned, stopping to note some landmarks like some distinctive rocks and trees, the water flow, and small animals going about their day. Nothing unusual for the woods.

After about two and a half hours in, I needed to take a break, the cart's weight was starting to wear down on my legs, a hard reminder of my last two years glued behind a desk. I stopped and pulled out a snack and a thermos of water from my backpack. I sat down on a rock next to the creek and enjoyed the views while eating a candy bar. Taking in the sights and sounds of nature, as I'm writing down more notes and eating. I suddenly noticed something odd.

All the normal woodland noises, wind rustling leaves, birds chirping, animals scurrying, all started to fade ever so gradually, until it was eerily quiet.

No birds, no critters, not even the creek beside me.

And then, very faintly, something whispered through the air, growing closer until it was right by my ear, a gentle “Hello?”

My heart skipped. I froze, the candy bar halfway to my mouth. “I’m hearing things. No way that was real."" I thought. But the voice had been so clear, very soft, an almost curious voice. like it was testing me. I glanced around, I saw nothing, but trees and the trail, not a soul in sight.

My mind raced. Why would something out here say “Hello”? I remembered the woman I spoke with on the phone, Jonah’s offhand mention at the gate, Josh’s vague warning, and Rich’s intense stare when he drilled the rule into me.

They all acted like saying “Hello” was life or death, but no one explained why. Was it some local superstition? A park tradition? Or something else entirely, something tied to this unnatural silence?

I swallowed hard, feeling exposed. I hadn’t said “Hello” when I stopped here, and now the woods felt… watchful. “Okay, fine,” I muttered to myself, following their instructions. “Hello? Sorry I didn’t say that earlier. I'm new around here.”

As subtly as the silence had crept in, the sounds returned: wind, water, birds, squirrels. All normal again. I exhaled, tension easing, but questions gnawed at me. What was that voice? Why did saying “Hello” seem to reset the world around me? It wasn’t just politeness, there was weight to it, like a key to something I didn’t understand.

I made a mental note to press Josh or Rich later, though their cagey responses so far didn’t promise answers.

“Okay, I have to remember to say ‘Hello’ anytime I enter a new area,” I told myself. “Apparently, something out here needs to hear it.” But what? And why did it feel like the woods were listening, waiting for me to slip up?

I finished my candy bar, packed up my trash, checked my map and compass, and continued for the remaining two and a half hours.

After what felt like forever, I finally reached the cabin just before nightfall, with the sun low enough to cast a golden glow on a small, picturesque log cabin, like a postcard scene.

Trees formed a canopy overhead, a clean walkway led to the door, birds and animals bustled, wind and water whispered sweetly. It was simply perfect.

I pulled the cart to the front door, then I start to search for a lockbox Rich mentioned, around back, hanging under a foundation leg i. I went around back and retrieved the key where Rich said it was. Then I returned to the front door and as I go to unlock the door, it happens again.

The silence crept in slow.

birds stopped, animals hushed, the woods goes quiet, and I start to hear the same sound when the voice went by my ear. My stomach twisted. Not again. Was this going to happen every time I forgot their damn rule? Was there something out here enforcing this ritual, waiting for me to acknowledge it? I didn’t know if I was being paranoid or if the woods were playing tricks, but I wasn’t about to test it.

“Hello out there!” I called, louder than necessary, my voice echoing slightly.

The sounds returned, just like before. I stood there, key in hand, staring into the darkening forest.

“Why does this keep happening?” I muttered. “What’s causing it? And why the hell does something out here say ‘Hello’ first?”

I wanted to chalk it up to exhaustion or my imagination, but the voice on the trail felt too real, too deliberate. It wasn’t human, not quite, but it wasn’t an animal either. It felt… expectant. Like it was part of some unspoken pact I’d stumbled into. I shook my head. “Only time will tell, I guess.”

I opened the door, dust billowed in the fading sunlight, visible through the windows. Clearly, no one had been here in a while. I stepped in and said, “Hello, I’m new here! I’ll be staying for a while, hope that’s okay?” My voice sounded small in the empty cabin, but I wasn’t taking chances after the trail. If saying 'Hello' kept the silence at bay, I’d do it, even if I didn’t understand why. Maybe it was just a quirk of the job, but the way Rich’s eyes had bored into me when he said it made me think there was more to it, something he wasn’t telling me.

Nothing responded, so maybe the “Hello” I said outside sufficed. I began unloading the cart, brought everything inside, and got settled in. I checked the computer, tried to figure out the old oven (knobs worn, hard to read temp and timer), I inspected the bathroom (shower with running water, but toilet was an outhouse-style seat over a deep hole, no strong smell, given the vacancy). After unpacking into drawers and the closet, it was dark out. I radioed Rich and logged today’s findings.

“This is Cabin 12 to Outpost Chance. Anyone copy?”

After a moment, Josh replied. “This is Ranger Josh with Outpost Chance. You make it to 12 alright? Over.”

“Yes safe and sound, I just finished getting settled in. Over.”

“Good. Glad you’re safe. What do you think of it, Alex? Over.”

“So far, so good. Gorgeous views, plenty to explore. The Cabin’s a little more Rustic than your dad let on, but it’s home now. I’ll make the best of it. Over.”

“Yeah, it's a bit run-down, and could use some updates. But it’s a roof and a bed. So make it home. How was the walk? Over.”

Rich said report anything, but not to discuss the 'Hello' rule. How do I explain the silence and faint voice? I needed answers. “On my way, I stopped halfway for a break—”

Josh cut in before I could finish, “Did you make sure to, well, you know? Over.""

Knowing he understood, I pushed for clarity. “Not at first. I sat down to rest, ate a little bit and suddenly everything went dead quiet. Then I swore I heard a faint ‘Hello’ go by my ear. I said it back, and everything went back  to normal. The same happened when I reached the cabin, but I remembered in time. Josh, what’s the deal? Why does something out here say ‘Hello’ and need to be told it back? What am I dealing with? Over.""

He let out a sigh, his voice sharp with urgency. “Make sure, I mean 100% sure, you say it! Every time you enter your zone. No matter what. Just do it and trust me, okay? Over.”

I didn’t fully trust him, not when no one would explain, but what choice did I have? “Okay, I trust you. I’ll keep it up. But besides that, the walk was uneventful. Copy that? Over.”

“copy, have you filled out your report yet? And is everything working? Power, water, fridge, oven? Or does anything need repairs? Over.”

“All good. The Oven’s a bit tricky cause the knobs are a bit messed up. but I'll make it work. And I'll have my report soon, before bed. How Copy? Over.”

“Copy. And Drop the extra radio lingo, no need. But good to hear. Make sure to radio in if you need anything. Oh, also get up sometime tonight for a quick peek outside. The Fire crossed our line unexpectedly. Over.”

“Can do. An Alarm is set for three hours from now. I’ll radio in if it’s important. Over.”

“Sounds good. I’m signing off. Sleep well, stay safe. Josh out.”

“Night, Josh. Alex out.”

I turned off the radio, grabbed a snack, and  sat down at the computer to log my report, omitting the silence and voice, but including notes and observations. Submitted it to the board's and Rich’s email.

Now With that done, I checked out the games on here. There was three. Tetris, Spider Solitaire and Texas Hold ’em. Better than absolutely nothing, I guess.

I started to play the poker game, turned on some music from my phone. And got lost playing for awhile. Then after some time. Without warning, silence fell. Absolute quiet, no music, no outside sounds, not even my own breath. fear hit, as I did begin to hear... multiple loud knocks at the door… Followed by a deep, gentle… “Hello?”

End of Chapter 3.

Chapter 4: The Knocking.

Loud, continuous knocking shook the door, followed by a deep, gentle “Hello?”

“What the fuck?” I thought, heart pounding.

Rich had said no one was allowed in zone this time of the year. And especially with the fire going on near by. staff only he said.

But possibly a lost hiker, maybe? Or even one of the guys messing with me?  I didn’t know, but the knocking grew louder, harder, insistent.

I stood frozen, glancing at the machete by the desk. Better be safe than sorry. I slowly get up to grab it, then tucking it behind me to avoid scaring a potential hiker, and I then crept to the door. Just in case, I called out, “Hello?”

The knocking stopped. Dead silence.

I gripped the knob, turned it slowly, and pulled the door open. Nothing. Not a soul, not even a footprint in the dirt.

The woods stared back at me, still, like they were holding their breath. I ran back inside and grabbed a flashlight from the desk and back outside to check around. I circled the cabin, staying close to its walls. Crickets chirped, owls hooted in the distance, all was peaceful, normal. But something felt wrong, like the silence was waiting to return.

“What the actual hell was that?” I muttered to myself. I headed back inside. I locked the door, checked every window and made sure they were all locked. and shut off the lights. It was nearly 1:30 a.m. I’d done my nightly check outside, as Josh had asked basically. and everything seemed fine except for the visitor there.

I was exhausted and needed to sleep. So I went to get ready for bed. I brushed my teeth, washed my face, grateful for the heated water. As I was leaving the bathroom. The toilet caught my eye as I passed. It was too deep, not like a normal outhouse style toilet. too dark, not dark in the it's just black down there. I mean dark like a bad presence was down there. like it led somewhere beyond dirt. I shivered, avoiding it.

I got changed into my sleep clothes. I then got into my sleeping bag, the bed seemed comfy but well worn, its sheets being clean are questionable though. The cabin was pretty chilly, so the sleeping bag a smart choice on all accounts. I zipped myself in tight. got comfortable, and passed out quicker than I thought. the woods now peaceful and sweet sounds lulling me to sleep. A good night, despite everything.

The next morning I woke up around 8:30 a.m. and surprisingly slept fairly well. I unzip my sleeping bag, the cold air biting me. Getting out of my sleeping bag took serious effort, who likes waking up freezing?

I got started on my morning routine. Get the coffee going, brush my teeth, put on clean clothes, have my coffee, and be ready for the day and my new life ahead.

(Several months pass)

Time had flew by out there.

When I arrived, it was starting to get chilly, leaves just starting falling. And now, a blanket of snow draped over everything, turning my zone into a breathtaking winter wonderland. The beauty of these woods never ceased, but I couldn’t shake the memory of that first night’s visitor or the way the silence felt alive, just waiting.

I spent my days out patrolling, mapping out important landmarks, the creeks near by, all the trees and what one's may fall at any time. I noted all the animal patterns. a massive buck with an impressive rack leading a herd deer, the squirrels scurrying about and playing. I saw a colorful duck flying overhead one day, with a unique neck band. Never seen one like it before.

I snapped a cute photo of two chipmunks sitting on a snow dusted log, snowflakes falling gently past them.

My reports to Rich and headquarters were detailed, sent via the cabin’s ancient computer. I was beginning to get pretty damn good at Texas Hold ’Em in my downtime, I started one of my puzzles and I'm almost done with one of my books. the oven’s worn knobs still baffled me, not sure what the temp actually is or anything like that, I've just been cooking by turning it on and wait for it to warm up, and then cook by guesswork and pull it out before it gets to burnt.

No more silence or ghostly visitors since that first night. I said “Hello” every time I stepped outside, entered a new area, or returned to the cabin. It was second nature now, a ritual to keep whatever called these woods home at bay.

Things felt and were normal...for a while.

Then one morning, I woke up late, around 10 a.m. Something was wrong.

Silence. Absolute, suffocating silence.

No animals outside, no wind rushing by, nothing at all.

“Maybe I’m still half asleep,” I told myself, heading to the bathroom. I peed, couldn’t hear myself go. I brushed my teeth, washed my face. no sound of water, no clink of the sink. It was like the woods had swallowed sound itself, just like that first night.

Had I forgotten to say “Hello” at some point yesterday and it's just now going silent? I didn’t think so, but I wasn’t taking chances. “Hello!” I called, waiting for the woods’ sounds to return, like before.

Nothing. No noise came back like the times before, just absolute deafening silence.

I couldn’t even hear my own voice, haven't had that happen before.

Panic crept in. I threw on a pair pants, a tee shirt, and some slippers I brought, stepped outside, and yelled, “Hello!” Still nothing. Just silence.

“Oh shit, this can’t be good.” I hurried back inside, went to the computer, and emailed the station.

""Rich, Josh, you two there? I just woke up and I can’t hear anything. What’s going on?”

A few minutes later, Jonah replied.

""Alex, it’s Jonah. Rich and Josh are out meeting with the neighboring rangers about some downed trees blocking the road coming in to the park. I’m watching the station while they're gone. Have you been making sure you're saying ""Hello""?""

“Yes, every damn time I move or breathe! I’ve been religious about it. Are you saying it?” I typed, frustrated.

He replied “I've been here for Four years and have never slipped up once. But the station’s safe space, The fence keeps it out. So I can hear just fine. Are you sure you’ve been saying it?”

“YES, I SWEAR! But If I'm making sure to say it out here. Then why is this happening?”

Jonah took a while to respond.

""Well, a year ago, during the off season. A homeless man wandered into the park, no one knew he was here, until the Silence hit.  we only knew what was happening cause Rich went to check the gate due to a brunch falling on it and noticed, after an hour of searching we came up with nothing. the Police were called and a massive search began. After a few days they found him. he couldn’t speak, just stared blankly. The police took him and after 3 days, the silence lifted. We never learned why it did""

My stomach dropped.

""So, then someone is probably out here? Like a hiker or something? And why didn't he speak?""

Jonah replied. “No clue, he couldn't even write or do anything at all. It's like he was in shock. But If there's someone new in the zone, it stirs things up and it won't stop until they are found and told to say 'Hello'.""

“Alright so should I head to the station to meet with you and then we both go search together?”

“No, I can’t leave. Rich’s orders: someone stays for radio and messages. Start at your cabin, search east heading toward the station and I'll be waiting for you.""

Great. I had to find a lost person in this silent hell, alone, without hearing. Whatever was out here didn’t just want ‘Hello’ it needed it, and someone’s silence was breaking everything.

""Okay, I'll pack a few things and start east. What’s the safe code? I'm not going out there without the Shotgun.""

""We're not allowed to give it out to anyone in the cabin unless it’s an absolute emergency.”

“THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE FUCKING EMERGENCY JONAH! GIVE ME THE DAMN CODE!”

“Okay fine. 2709. there's Shells inside a bag inside. Be safe, bring your radio in case you find someone. If you’re not here by nightfall, I will come out looking.”

“I’ll do my best, hopefully I'll hear from you soon"" I replied.

I threw on my cold weather gear, packed some food, water, an extra jacket, flashlight, batteries, and the radio. I opened the safe, loaded the 12 gauge, slung the ammo bag over my shoulder, grabbed my map, and headed east.

As I went out into the woods, the silence felt heavier, like it was watching me. I had 10 miles to cover before dark, hoping to find whoever was causing this and stop it, for their safety and all of ours.

Five miles in, around 2 p.m., I made good time despite the silence. Dark clouds rolled in, and snow fell hard, blanketing the trail. I neared a pond I’d marked, expecting it frozen, empty of all animals and life right now.

I was wrong.

The massive buck I’d noted was thrashing in the pond, breaking ice, covered in blood. Along the bank, laying all Around it, the bodies of his herd lay scattered, torn apart. The silence wasn’t just quiet it was driving the woods to slaughter.

“What the hell is going on?” I thought, frozen, watching the buck’s frenzied destruction.

It then suddenly stopped, it turned towards me, it saw me, and then charged at me.

1ql29v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1ql29v1/tall_rant/,Tall rant,"Not allowing partners to choose their days off is utilitarian. 

It’s demanding that we align our lives with the schedule that suits the stores (oh I meant, “coffee houses’) needs. Instead of the opposite. 

Creating the availability window to be 1,000% open to adhere to the “coffee houses’” needs is bs. 

I’ve been gaslit to the point of frustration about my availability.

My life does not revolve around Starbucks just because I have nothing else going on. I have a life to live. I don’t want to be the partner that passes away & gets replaced… 

We’re unfairly treated like robots & the availability proves that. The SM copy & pastes the schedule every week to the point where if one schedule doesn’t work for him he won’t change it. 

I work in a busy drive thru /pick up store with mandatory weekends and I’m available every single day. It’s BS. But of course Sundays are highly requested. There are certain partners who don’t work the weekends or they’re just scheduled for one day in the weekend because their availability is honored. There’s supposed to be fair rollover for the scheduling so we can all take turns getting a day on the weekends off…

It’s ridiculous to create a new availability and not be able to accommodate your own life and your needs.

But to create a new availability now you have to add 50+ hrs (which we don’t even work!) and if you leave one day off it doesn’t fit the needs of the store. Just leaving it blank. Not acceptable. Acknowledging that if I needed to be called in I’d go in doesn’t suffice either. 

It’s one day. I get treated like a little kid about it—why do you think you’re the only one that deserves that one day off?—I’d have to give everyone that day off—(people callout whenever they want to).

I’ve been pushed to opening & told I’d be taking away hours from my coworkers if I move to mid. 

It’s gaslighting. It doesn’t work for me anymore. 

I’m a 4 & a half year partner ready to hang my apron forever at this point. The benefits have kept my sanity, but being treated like I have no choice when I get to have a break is pushing it.

This is a food service job at the end of the day it will not matter.

Why am I so picky about my ingredients?

Let's talk about coumarin.

**What is it?**

Coumarin is a natural compound in cinnamon. In high amounts over time, it literally kills liver cells.  Not something you want piling up if you're adding cinnamon to your coffee, tea, or smoothies every day.

Most cinnamon in stores is Cassia cinnamon. It's cheap, it's strong, and it's loaded with coumarin. If you're using it daily, you're getting way more than your liver wants to deal with.

Friends, trading cheap for quality just isn't a healthy outlook for our bodies.

**The fix:**

I use Ceylon cinamon, in all of my teas and really anytime I use cinnamon. Also called True Cinnamon or Cinnamomum verum. It has way less coumarin, so it's actually safe for daily use. It's sweeter, more delicate, and higher quality. Sure... it costs about 4x more than the ""cheap stuff"" but isn't your health worth it? I know the answer is a resounding YES for me and my family!!

**Why is it called Ceylon?**

 Well it comes from Sri Lanka, which the British named ""Ceylon"".  Sri Lanka changed their name in 1972 after gaining independence from the British and adopting a new constitution.  The name stuck. So when you see ""Ceylon Cinnamon,"" it's just telling you it's from Sri Lanka—the real, high-quality stuff. You might also see it labeled as *Cinnamomum verum* (which literally means ""true cinnamon"" in Latin). That's the scientific name. If you see that on the label, you're good.

**Ceylon Cinnamon:**

* From Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon)
* Low coumarin, safe for daily use
* Sweeter, more delicate
* Scientific name: *Cinnamomum verum*

**Cassia Cinnamon:**

* From China, Indonesia, Vietnam
* High coumarin, hard on your liver 
* Stronger, spicier
* Cheap, common in stores
* Probably sitting in your pantry right now

**Bottom line:**

If your'e like me and love cinnamon, go the extra mile and do good by your body.

Check your labels. If it just says ""cinnamon,"" it's Cassia. If it says ""Ceylon,"" ""True Cinnamon,"" or *Cinnamomum verum*, you're good.",2,1769200272.0,wellnessteatalk,0,1.0,False

She has a stressful work environment, experiences a lot of traditional pressure in her family, and she suffers from severe PMDD and some form of anxiety. We both work full time, have no kids, and I manage daily domestic tasks like the cleaning, dishes and laundry. Having to do more around the house during these times is no issue for me especially if it means my wife gets to relax.

Unfortunately I am starting to feel resentful and emotional burnout from her relying on me, partially because I have no time for myself to recover. She relies on me to maintain emotional steadiness as she is prone to panic attacks, and feels unloved if I am not able to anticipate her mood changes. Although I ask frequently, she doesn't feel cared for if: I ask directly about her needs and she has to spell things out for me, if I'm not completely attuned to her mood and the situation. E.g. I cook breakfast every morning but didn't include enough protein for a meal while on her period. Although I have it typically marked on my calendar, she has gotten upset that I wasn't considerate of her.

I understand that she needs a lot of care and to continue supporting her I feel I need time to recharge, but conflict breaks out when I state that I would like to work out, spend some time with friends, or add to my professional development. I want to make some headway writing my new book which would require at least 3-5 hours a week of research, reading, or writing. I also care a lot about my fitness so I would like to fit in workouts \~2 hours a week. Most of these things can be completed from my home office and home gym. If I could schedule the occasional coffee to see some of my friends, that would be incredible for my mental health.

Unfortunately, this starts a lot of fights with her as she feels like I am taking away our couple time.

*I am looking for advice navigating conversations about personal time but I don't even know if the conflict I am experiencing is normal -- How often do you fight with your spouse? What's a reasonable compromise for time that you make in your relationship to make this work? Is there anything I can do to help navigate this and not be emotionally burnt out?*

**Current Barriers:**

\- **Hostility towards conversation**: My wife becomes hostile at the suggestion of me having personal time. Most conversations are perceived as me wanting to be away from her which results in an argument, or her becoming anxious or disappointed in the relationship.

\- **My wife values spending time in parallel**. For instance, she would like to wake up together on our days off, but we have different wake times and I might be awake a few hours before she is. If I am on my phone when she wakes up this turns into an argument. I can't leave bed before she wakes or she feels like she is left behind. I value her comfort it is important to me for her to feel loved, but I feel like she doesn't value my time the same way.

\- **She doesn't like to have separate hobbies** so we end up doing what she prefers

\- **Arguments are exhausting, explosive and can last 2-6 hours of a day, and sometimes 2-3 times a week**. There are so many triggers to our fights that it's almost unavoidable. Our fights are best described as anxious-avoidant dances. My wife becomes more aggressive and I tend to lose focus and disengage despite my best efforts to stay present. This results in her doubling down and becoming more anxious, then sometimes turns into a panic attack. After the fights, my wife experiences emotional hangovers that she feels are my responsibility to help her recover from in the days to follow.

It's important that I don't do anything to remind her of previous arguments, but the pile of triggers is mounting, the fights seem cumulative, and I feel like I'm slowly burning out trying to manage or avoid those triggers.

**Current Considerations:**

\- I suspect my wife might have a form of anxiety that she might need more support than I can provide, but she doesn’t open up to her friends and comes from a background where mental health is not discussed with family or community.

\- I am in weekly therapy to help learn how better to talk to her better, as to trigger her sadness less and hopefully have these conversations from a more regulated space on my end.

\- My wife and I attend therapy monthly and separately and I have suggested going to couples therapy but we are not attending at this time and are discussing returning.

\- My wife needed a lot of support prior to being married, but these fights started happening around our engagement. I assumed it was just wedding planning pressure.

1ql1z8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Letters_Unsent/comments/1ql1z8o/asking_for_the_pain_so_i_can_heal/,Asking for the pain so I can heal.,"Dear Ava- 

I don’t want to feel anything for you anymore, Ava.

Not because you’ve done something wrong, and not because I’m angry just because I don’t know how to keep carrying this the way it is. When I told you about the internship, I think it scared me more than I let on. 

Everything here feels unfamiliar and heavy, and I was overwhelmed. I wasn’t trying to change anything between us. I think I just wanted a friend someone steady while I tried to find my footing in a place that makes me feel out of place.

This place has been hard on me. People look at me like I don’t quite belong, like I showed up from the wrong direction at the wrong time. I don’t know if it’s my accent, or that I didn’t grow up here, or that I stand out without meaning to but it wears on me. I was lonely, and I reached for connection the only way I knew how. Maybe I leaned too hard. Maybe I should’ve kept more of myself tucked away. If I crossed a line, I’m sorry.

What I didn’t expect was how deeply you’d settle into me.

My heart and my mind don’t agree about you. My mind tells me I should let go, that distance would be healthier. But my heart doesn’t listen. It keeps responding, keeps hoping, keeps feeling. And it’s strange how someone I’ve never met can matter this much. I don’t know your voice. I don’t know your face. I just know your thoughts, the things you love, the way you exist in fragments and somehow that’s been enough.

You’ve become like a drug to me, but not in a dramatic way. More like a quiet dependence. Like something that eases the ache just enough to keep me coming back, even though it never really heals anything. Every small interaction feels like a dose brief relief followed by the same longing. And I don’t know how to detox while the door is still half open.

That’s why I need things to end fully.

Not because I don’t care but because I care too much, and I can’t make my heart stop on my own. I need the clean pain of absence. I need the sharpness of knowing it’s over so my heart can finally break a little, mourn properly, and begin to let go. Right now, the occasional messages, the videos, the moments of contact they keep my feelings alive when they need to be allowed to die.

I invited you for coffee because I hoped, foolishly that maybe presence would help me understand what this is, or help me release it. Even though you didn’t come, the feelings stayed. And that’s what scares me most. I can’t convince myself to move on while you’re still here in pieces, while part of me keeps waiting.

So I’m asking you, gently, to stop talking to me. Not as rejection. Not as punishment. But as mercy.

I don’t have the strength to let go while you’re still reaching out, and I don’t want to resent something that was never meant to hurt me. I need space big enough for this to end honestly, even if that ending hurts.

I’m sorry it has to be this way.

And I’m grateful for what you were to me, even if it couldn’t last.

**Location:** Brisbane Queen Street and Garden City

**Mood:** I was not in the best mood today. I was feeling like I was not good at holding conversations and my diet has been terrible all week. I will not eat out or drink coffee tomorrow

**Limiting Beliefs:** I can't hold a good conversation, I am too old, I don't know what to say, I am not good looking enough, she doesn't like me, I fucked up

**Reframe Beliefs:** I did great doing approaches, who has the balls to do it, I am very close to the next level

**Social Exposure:** 11 approaches, 2 Phone Numbers, 9 conversations that could have led to something

**Day Summary:**

We went to the mall since it was raining. There were quite a few cute girls and I had some solid interactions that I was excited about and feel I could have had the results I wanted if I was leading the interactions correctly. I've been thinking that I am not getting the coaching I need to get me to the next level. I spent $4.5k with Daniel and utilized $2k of it already and I don't have anything tangible. All we have done so far is to set goals, go over wins and when he is in my ear he is just saying I did a good job keeping her to stay in. I do not consider this worth $2000 and I don't want to waste the other $2.5k so I told him I didn't want to do the coaching any longer. I don't think it is a great value and hasn't boosted me the way I thought it would

We went down to Queen Street when we got back. I was still in my head about the sets earlier I felt I blew so I was just looking to get them done. They were ok, but glad I got them done.

I had a date at 6pm with a ""girl"" I matched with on Bumble. She mentioned in her bio she was not looking for pen pals and just wanted to meet up. The texting was pretty straight forward and we decided to meet up today.

From the start I was thrown off and didn't think she was the most attractive. It really made me realize why I don't really like to do online dating anymore. I want to be able to know I will be attracted to someone right away. I could feel something was off.

We ordered a drink and I just could tell I wasn't that attracted to her and as I looked closer it looked to me like she had an Addams apple. At this point I knew I did not want to there with her.

The conversation was pretty boring and I wasn't really engaging much. I sent George a message to look at my phone to see if this was a dude, but she had already unmatched on Bumble. She asked me to show my muscles at one point when I said I go to the gym, which I found pretty weird and so I said I was too shy. She flexed and it was weird too.

She asked how many Bumble dates I've been on and I said I didn't use online dating much. She mentioned she had been on 3 so far in Brisbane and the first one they become friends. She said she felt the same vibe with me. This was no surprise since I didn't have any interest in her anyways. I finished my juice and said I had to go.

I will probably not spend any more time with online dating while I am here and will stick to cold approach and making content.

I came home after that and George and I went to the sauna.

I have been talking to Lizzie and we were supposed to go to the sauna, cold plunge and deprivation tank Tuesday, but I guess she started her period today and doesn't want it to leak. She did say she was excited to see me though, so we will meet on Tuesday as of now. I don't put a ton of stock in it as girls flake, but it would be good to see her.

I know I am very close to getting to the next level though and soon I will be having more and more dates.

I will not drink coffee or eat out this entire week (Unless it is on a date). I will get back into good shape and feel good and sexy again.

**What changed in me today?:**

* I left a date early instead of sticking it out with someone I didn't want to see

**Biggest Lesson / Takeaway for the Day:**

* I need to take the time to write out this stuff and study it everyday until it is internalized

**Top 3 Interactions:**

* **Mia -** She was exactly my type. She was hooked and had her legs crossed. She loved the compliment and the interaction. If I was telling stories and had good qualification and structure this would have been a close
* Yuna - First approach of the day was solid. She was receptive and liked the flirting and attraction. She was responding to my texts, but it sounds like she does not live in the city so I will never see her, but still a good interaction
* Anest - I handled her being scared pretty well. I felt like I was doing some good flirting and I did go for the number close, but I also didn't feel it was super strong. I have some work to do

**What will I work on tomorrow:**

* I will watch Tom Torero and write out a story, some qualifications and some of the stacks I can use to get my interactions over the line. I could have gotten some numbers from the hottest girls if I was focused and had a good structure

**Approaches:**

**1-18-26**

1. Korean girl Yuna at the Mall - She was walking very slow and looking at her phone. She is Korean and was just walking the mall getting some shopping done. She has been in Brisbane for about a year. She was very receptive to my teasing and would cover her mouth and laugh when i talked about me needing to buy new shoes since it was raining out. The vibe was good, but I felt I was struggling in the interaction. I will sit down and watch Tom Torero tomorrow and right out some stacks, stories and qualifications
2. Australian girl at grocery - We were heading to the grocery store and I saw a cute girl leaving. I said she looked very creative like she was an artist and I said she was exotic looking. She is from Brisbane and she was on her way to go meet her friends to do some vision boards which I thought was pretty cool. The vibe seemed decent and she seemed to like the compliment. I didn’t feel like I was doing a great job being natural and enjoying the interaction. She did mention she had a boyfriend already
3. Taiwan girl - Tai chi , fungnshway, the triads  -There was a Taiwanese girl who I stopped and she seemed pretty receptive. She was super cute and seemed confused when I left. I didn't really know what to say so I left. I think if I was more comfortable I could have gotten her number
4. Mia cute blonde girl- She was waiting in line to get a juice and was wearing some sexy yoga pants and a top that showed her cleavage. She was super hot and one of the cutest girls I’ve opened in a long time. She hooked pretty much immediately and had her legs crossed. She is from Brisbane and had just gotten done working out at the gym. She gave me some good leeway, but I never capitalized on it. She looked disappointed when she left and I didn’t lead the interaction. If I was on point and was telling stories or teasing I think this would have been 100% a number and a date. There was definitely attraction, I just wasn’t doing the right things.
5. Girl working at store - There was a blonde girl working at the makeup store. I couldn’t see her from the front, but behind she looked like she would be cute. She was standing observing the store and had a power pose so I went in and teased her that she was the security guard and had to make sure no one was stealing. She laughed and lit up with this. The interaction was pretty bantery and I would make her laugh a few times. I don’t remember if she really hooked, but I was also nervous and again not really leading the interaction the way I wanted to. I said she was cute a few times, but never went for a close and then awkwardly left the set. I think this could have been a number close for sure too if I was telling stories, and qualifying. 
6. Girl on phone - There was a girl walking by on her phone who I said was cute. She stopped and seemed receptive, but I was already in my head from the interactions earlier so she left.
7. Girl from Philippines - I got back from Garden City and then went down to Queen Street. She was pretty receptive from the start, but when she said she was from the Philipines my story telling was off, so I stumble through the interaction. She was looking for Central Station. I didn’t lead the interaction and she said she had to go
8. Girl yawning in alcohol area - I saw her as I was walking to Woolworths. She was yawning in the alcohol area so it seemed like an easy tease. She thought I was working there. I said she was cute and then said she looked Russian. She is actually from Australia, and because my storytelling was weak I just left
9. Asian girl in black with a boyfriend - Saw her walking and couldn’t tell how cute she was, but decided to go in. She said immediately she had a boyfriend
10. Anest - rocker girl - She was tattooed up and was wearing all black with Dr. Martens. She was super scared when I stopped her because she was on her phone and looking down. She is from Whales and was just getting done working. It felt that it was a bit flirty and a decent set, but again my story telling and qualification was not very good, or at least I felt it wasn’t good. She was on her way to a bar after work. I got her number, but I didn’t think she was all that interested in me, so I haven’t texted her.
11. Dubai flight attendant - I was walking home from my date and was just going to go inside and not do an approach. I did what George said and just looked straight to give her a chance to look at me. I caught her looking at me and so I stopped her with the front stop. She was pretty receptive and was pretty cute. She is a flight attendant based out of Dubai and is actually from there. She said she was tired and wanted to go to bed in her hotel room, so I didn’t push it very far.

**Location:** Brisbane Queen Street

**Mood:** Slightly tense early, grounded by the end

**Limiting Beliefs:** I'm not good at this, I don't know what to say, she is too hot, she is too young, she wouldn't like me, I can't approach a group, I'm too old, my hair is too thin and messy

**Reframe Beliefs:** I am doing great work with interactions, I am taking action and doing a great job, I am capable of great thing, my hard work will pay off

**Social Exposure:** 12 approaches, 3 Phone numbers with 2 responses, 6 decent interactions

**Day Summary:**

* I don't think today was all that great. My interactions were pretty bad and nothing to speak of, my YouTube video wasn't great, I was tired, I spent too much money on junk food and coffee, I went to bed early because I had no date, I ran a bit, but because of the junk food was not able to keep a steady pace, and I did sauna, but couldn't stay in long. I also think I over texted the 20 year old.
* Not happy with the results of the day.
* I did complete 2 SIREN breakdowns though and did sell a SIREN breakdown course

**Biggest Lesson / Takeaway for the Day:**

* I have to work on the front stop and actually get the girl to stop. Too many times they are able to walk past me. This never happens to Tom or Jon Matrix

**Top 3 Interactions:**

* Moka - She was very receptive and quite hot. She was only in town for the day though so no chance of a meet up
* Marina - She was pretty cute and seemed receptive. She has not messaged back though
* Martina - Italian girl who was on her way to work. She was pretty friendly and receptive. I don't think the interaction was long enough to get her out though

**What will I work on tomorrow:**

* I will work on the front stop and being a bit more energetic.

**Approaches:**

1. Girl in target with boyfriend - Approached her after some hesitation. I actually saw her when I was near the grocery store, but she was walking so fast I just waited to see where she would go. She ended up in Target and I was having some doubts on if I should approach. Decided I would go for it, and she said immediately that she had a boyfriend so I left
2. Italian girl on her way to work - She was pretty receptive from the start and just like the Austrian from yesterday she grabbed my hand right away and I held it for awhile. She just arrived in Brisbane a few days ago and was on her way to test out for a new job. She was pretty fun and she seemed to hook pretty easily. The interaction was not that long though so I was pretty sure she would flake. She wasn’t nearly as cute as I thought she would be. I did get her WhatsApp, but no response
3. Girl with tattoos - Stopped a girl who I couldn’t see her face. She had a bunch of tattoos which I don’t normally like, but her body looked decent. I stopped her and I said I liked her adorable tattooed look. She had fake tits and fake lips and a bunch of makeup. She was from Australia I think and I said how all those girls were trouble. I think she got bored of it and said she had to go. I was upset I got rejected, but this was not a girl I would want to see or probably sleep with so it was not a big deal. It was more a hit to my ego that she wasn’t interested
4. German girl - Saw her while I was getting my coffee. I said she looked so relaxed and then said she looked Swedish or Finnish. She is actually from Germany and is traveling with a friend through Australia. They were in town for the day and going to the Young Blood concert and then tomorrow they are going to Cairns to see if they like it there. The interaction was decent, but I don’t think I really built up much attraction or interest. I did go for the number close, but she said no and said she would never be back in Brisbane
5. Girl at restaurant - Saw a girl walking the street and I was hesitant to open her. She ended up going to the restaurant for food. I waited until she ordered and sat down and said she looked nice. She was from Australia and I was thrown off on what I should say, so I left. I didn’t feel like she was really interested, but that was probably more self doubt
6. Italian girl at juice bar - There was a girl who I saw and I hesitated to open her too. I thought maybe she was too old, but I was also tired of not getting my approaches done. I said she looked nice and that she must be Italian, which she was. The conversation seemed to be going decent, but when her order was ready she wanted to leave. I may have been able to be persistent, but I wasn’t really feeling in the grove and was not in a great mood
7. Chinese girl at the bus - Walked by and said she looked nice. She said thanks, but didn’t seem super interested right away and was looking at her phone so I left
8. Moka Japanese girl - She was super cute. I tried to do a front stop, but she did walk past a little. This has to get corrected. I am being too passive with the front stop and girls always walk past a bit. Luckily she still stopped and talked. She is from Japan is visiting a friend. The vibe was fun and flirty and she seemed to hook pretty quickly. I seeded us going to Las Vegas and her taking me to Japan. She was off to meet her friend for dinner and it is her last night in town. She said it would have been nice to meet up, but with her being with her friend she couldn’t. I went for broke and said if she was feeling adventurous to let me know
9. Girl with boyfriend on bench - Blonde girl on the bench on her phone. Good I went in and interrupted her, but she said she had a boyfriend immediately. 
10. Japanese girl eating chips - Saw a girl eating chips and was pretty cute. She was from Japan, but was not interested in taking to me. My vibe was off I’m sure as I had been out here for hours without much momentum and I wanted to just be done
11. Japanese girl Marina - Went back out after the run and sauna since George had his girl over. Saw a girl who was walking by herself fairly slow. I was hesitant to open her after all the interactions earlier in the day, but decided I would go in. She was pretty receptive from the start. My front stop was weak again, but she did stay and talk. She has been in Brisbane for 3 years, is 31 years old and teaches Japanese to students once per week. The conversation seemed alright and I felt I was doing a good job leading it. I offered to take her for coffee or tea, but she said she had to go to meet her flatmate. I sent her a message, but haven’t heard anything back
12. Asian girl with braces. - Walking home and saw a tiny asian girl so figured I would do one more and go home. She had braces and said thanks for the compliment, but then said she had to leave right away. I’m pretty sure I’ve opened this girl before with the same results

**For Me:**

* I am really not happy with the coaching I am getting from Daniel. I paid him $4.5k and I have nothing tangible, my results are getting worse and the only feedback he gives is to think positive. I was expecting my results to skyrocket with the amount of approaches I have been doing, but I feel things have gotten worse. I could have supported myself for 4 months with that money. I am really disappointed and I don't know what I should say to him about it. All we do on the calls is role play or go over my wins. It is not helping me at all get to the next level. I think the main reason I did the coaching was because it would reduce the amount of taxes I owe, and it was supposed to help me excel to becoming a better coach, but this is really not very helpful. Should I ask for a refund for the remaining coaching? I don't know if that is even possible. I am really disappointed that is for sure.",2,1769199946.0,TheUnstoppableMan,0,1.0,False

Capitol Care cares too little.

Homestead and Willow Glen I've heard were brutal.

Komino's and Danielle's Law share heartbreaking stories that propelled the state of NJ to ensure better protections were put into place for disabled people.

It wounds me that some clients receive 24 hour around the clock monitoring of every appointment they will ever have, even non-medical ones. I don't think we treat non-developmentally disabled humans with the same level of attention or pedantry. If an appointment to get a nail clipping is missed it is documented. If a non-vital shot is rescheduled to the next day due to a problem with paperwork that dod not involve the agency but a family membee, it is labeled an ""incident"" and laws state it must be reported to all family and guardians.

The family and GUARDIANS get sick of hearing about how 

\* Jonesy Butterballturkey threw himself on the floor like they did since they were 7 because they had a tantrum about something they've known and been taught how to cope with since they were 8 - just calling to inform you they are not seeking hospitalization nor were any injuries observed

\* Lara Croft did not want to go to the gynecologist and has not gone for 8 years despite all the prompting and encouragement from staff and family in gmthe world - just calling to let you know for the 20th time this month they did not go and I cannot make them go

\* Mary Mary So Contrary spilled her beer on her shoes

\* Tom Sawyer spilled his coffee and had absolutely no injuries and does this 6 times a month specifically for attention and the family member knows and has denied any and all supports/restraints/behavior plans to correct or restrict this behavior

\* Ryan Dennys had signs of a seizure (but also has a noted history of faking seizures to force Staff to respond to him) and demanded to go to the hospital. This is the 30th time they've done this this year - just calling to let you know all paperwork was done and all his contacts were notified.

Like I get this is a vulnerable population but I think context, history, repetition, and involvement should be considered. I don't think every DSP is secretly stubbing out their cigarette butts on clients' arm1s then getting away with it because they're sleeping with the client's parents and collecting government checks in some crazy scheme. 

But then ohhhh its the opposite problem where the client who smokes 20 packs a day and refuses to leave their room and forces their peers and staff to inhale secondhand smoke is allowed to do so uninhibited because its ""their right."" And they've been in the group home for a year and the only response you get from management is ""could you maybe ask the client to hand over their cigarettes?"" Suuuuuure.

Or a client goes to the hospital 20 times a month because they have weird pains or headaches that appear and disappear. The hospital discharges them the same night and the staff is visibly annoyed they keep popping up. The family knows this client is an ambulance chaser. But legally the moment they want medical care, they have to go. Lord knows if you or I had pains and wanted to go, we'd be charged half of our remaining lifespan just for a clean bill of health even with insurance, but the government insists this client should have unlimited ambulance rides despite a documented history of lying to get what they want or to avoid activities they dislike. There's a client with actual medical needs losing a spot because this yoke is allowed unparalleled response.

Surely hospitals collect information on your medical history and t24bere are various hurdles to the type of care they can provide you, but the level of oversight/bureaucracy/mismanagement in group homes is just exhausting at times. This feels specific to group homes and behavioral populations.

**Recap**: After a historical nite of losing 10 parlays by 1-leg each and losing a big bet on yesterday's POTD, gotta take today's POTD off. I made all the wrong moves yesterday. Cashed out one the lays that would have covered my losses and loss out big on straight bet just on the Lakers to win and to top that off wit 10 parlays ALL losing by 1-leg (not to mention that 4 plays got hooked as well). I prolly won't be diving into this UFC card that I have been really looking forward to either. 

**Matchup:** I will be going very, very light today, but again prolly won't be handicapping a POTD in a bit since my units took a toll on the last POTD and my bankroll took a massive hit yesterday as well on other plays in excruciating fashion. BOL, everyone.

**The Play & Prediction :**

1ql1pmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1ql1pmk/but_it_was_working_on_friday/,But it was working on Friday,"I was tech support for a $90m tier 1 automotive company that had a secondary operation making the same product, but for the aftermarket crowd (official dealer repair). That plant was about 8 mi away, just far enough to be a PITA. Maybe 20 PCs, local LAN and a Novell server for local storage.

Anyway, I got a call on a Monday morning that a shop floor PC could not log in. No details, no errors, the office person calling was just relaying that the worker couldn't do their job, loss of production and MY fault, yada, yada.

So I grab a cuppa coffee and head out. Get there, head to shop floor area and ....

Nothing- literally nothing - the desk was gone, the PC was gone the entire work cell machine was gone.

Grabbed the plant manager and he said, Oh yeah, they moved it over the weekend. He took me the ""new"" area where the PC was sitting in a pile of wires, power cords, power strips, printer - you get the picture. We started looking at it and ...

The ""new"" area did not have any power even close, no network drop, basically just a pile in the middle of the floor.

I told them to call me when power and network were ready and left. I did make a point to snap some pictures and, back at the office, talked with the division manager on the incident. He told me to play it quiet for a while.

Sure enough, on Friday, I was called into the production staff meeting, already in progress. The other plant manager had just told the group that the production in that area was off because the PC didn't work and I had been called but....

I had my laptop, plugged into the projector they were using, and lo and behold, there were pics I had taken and enlarged the one of the plant manager with his hands in his pockets, looking at pile of PC stuff.

I said, you were going to call after you had power/network squared away, Is it Done? Response ""uh, no"". ""Ok, call me whenever it is ready."" Turned to the division manager, asked ""Anything else you need me for?""

Straight-faced, he replied ""No, thank you""...and he did buy the refreshments after work...

FWIW: yes crap happens, but this was bad planning of the manager's part.

I still would have let it slide but he DID make a point of throwing me under the staff meeting bus, so there ya go, bubba",163,1769199465.0,talesfromtechsupport,10,0.98,False

1ql1p17,https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1ql1p17/finally_drew_the_line_the_inlaws_are_moving_out/,Finally drew the line - the in-laws are moving out,"I knew transitioning into motherhood was going to be hard. I did not realize just how much the load was going to land solely on me. My husband is in a high-profile tech job, and has been completing a bunch of industry certifications over the past \~2 years, which will wrap up in this spring. My engineering career is on the back burner to allow him to be successful. I opted for a WFH role in an industry I am very fluent in, because I knew I was going to be the default parent, and trying to be productive while sleep deprived. It is hard, but we are working through it to find a better balance.

My husband and I have always had issues getting along with his mother specifically. There are so many core differences between our lives - white collar vs. blue collar work, political views, working mom vs SAHM, overall temperament, the list goes on and on. Pretty much every time we would visit them, there would be some sort of yelling match between the two of them over the pettiest things, and I would emotionally shut down until she would inevitably flip the light switch back into ""normal MIL"" without any warning a few days later. We have suspected some flavor of undiagnosed bipolar/borderline personality disorder. FIL is a complete recluse, and stays out of it all unless MIL needs backup.

The in-laws retired about 2 years ago, and had been looking to move to West Virginia because it's dirt cheap. I had some concerns about two elderly people moving out to the middle of nowhere without local family or neighbors they could call if/when an emergency occurs, since we are on the west coast. While I was pregnant, MIL went on and on about how her favorite time in life was when she had young kids, how it would be such a joy to help take care of our baby after he was born, and how confident she was in being able to do it all day. I had my hesitations about it from the get go - especially in transitioning into toddlerhood, but her confidence was firm.

My husband initiated the ""what if we tried living together"" conversation with them. We were entertaining the thought of moving from our 2 bedroom apartment to a bigger rental when our lease expired, and the stars seemed to all align with them selling their house. We opted for a month-long trial of MIL coming to help with childcare and delay daycare while I went back to work at about 2 months postpartum. It was rocky to say the least. Even with frequent newborn naps, MIL could really only handle a schedule of 9-12 & 1-4. I did my best to squeeze a ""full day"" of work into condensed hours, while exclusively pumping and having very intermittent sleep to take care of said newborn. Pretty quickly, MIL had another one of her blow ups, about how she thought my husband would be helping her out more, and how it felt like we were dumping a lot on her. News flash: babies are a lot of work for everyone involved. Needless to say, we opted for full time daycare, and choked up the monthly $4k tuition (thank you, SoCal).

We worked through these issues, and reevaluated expectations to a point where everyone agreed to move forward early this year. We moved to a much larger rental house with a main floor bedroom, attached full bathroom, and separate living room to comfortably accommodate them moving in with us. The intent was for them to help bridge the gap in my husband's availability - some extra hands around when the hubs has to work late/travel, or let me get some chores done on the weekend. The rent they are chipping in is less than half of the additional cost to accommodate them, compared to finding a place for just the 3 of us. 100% of my 6-figure salary is going towards paying for full time daycare and offsetting their living expenses.

In the first \~6 months of living together, they totally gated off their area, and seemed to do everything in their power to stay segregated. Offers to join us for dinner were shot down, they would spend all day on their separate devices, purchased separate appliances (refrigerator, coffee maker) to avoid interaction, and would hide in their room when I would get back from daycare pickup, leaving me to somehow cook dinner alone with an increasingly mobile baby. They repeatedly ignored preset boundaries of ""don't talk politics,"" and at minimum on a monthly basis, some dumb yelling match came up, and we would get the silent treatment for days. MIL had her desk with the screen facing the kitchen. Consistently and exclusively following these fights, I could see her browsing Zillow in the few minutes I came downstairs to make lunch. All in all, it was very clear that they did not actually want to be involved or help out. I have become so emotionally tapped out from their fighting that it is not worth the chance of conflict to ask them for help, even when I'm drowning.

About 5 months ago, we had the ""living together isn't working, let's talk about other options for when the lease is up."" We were met with total silent treatment for a week, extreme passive-aggressive behavior, slamming doors while we have a sleeping baby, etc. etc. MIL was not subtle in talking on the phone and spewing lies about how I ""expected her to take care of the baby all day,"" which clearly is not true with full time daycare.

We put a pin in formally separating our living situation, since my husband's job location is in flux again. The bandaid for this was explicitly communicating that the hour between daycare pickup at 5 and dinner at 6 was consistently the hardest hour of my day. For about a month or month and a half, they were taking the kid out for a stroller walk around the neighborhood. If I happened to have a light day of work and pick up earlier, they would immediately take him for their hour, negating any help while cooking. They don't want to actually sit down and play with their grandchild because strapping him into a stroller is easier. ""Help"" from them on the weekends is much spottier. By early afternoon, we are a little stir-crazy, and often to to the park or run some mindless errands. It is not uncommon for us to get home and they are out for the evening with the excuse of ""we didn't know when you'd be back"", so no help there.

Things really and truly came to a head the week before Thanksgiving. The hubs was out of town for a work conference all week. He had been very busy with a major project the past few weeks, so I was covering more of the household/childcare labor recently. I didn't care to deal with my mid-week birthday under these circumstances. The morning he left, MIL blew up at me over not being informed about this trip (not even true). Tuesday evening rolled around, and the child has a 104 degree fever. My boss was very understanding, but I still have to field time-sensitive messages and try to squeeze in whatever work I can during nap time/after hours the rest of the week. I had learned from previous sick days to maybe be able to expect an extra hour of help from the in-laws in the morning, but that's it.

That Saturday morning, my husband gets a wildly offensive text from his mom about me. Some highlights include that I am a miserable person, do not enjoy being around my child, don't have a life, and am constantly spying on everything they say and do. I was absolutely fuming at this, and I spent the rest of the day out with the toddler until picking up the hubs from the airport late afternoon. This was the final straw that really sealed their fate.

We had a conversation with them, and they very seriously started looking at houses. They just put an offer in on their favorite, and flew out this morning for a two week trip, before they formally start moving out. The hubs has been home for the past couple of weeks, so he has been hearing firsthand what my everyday life has been like, and said it was considerably worse than he thought. He got an earful on the drive to the airport about how they were promised full retirement and they don't want to raise our kid, and a bunch of bullshit about how I am the one with attitude issues. Never mind the fact that they said they wanted to be helpful, have been emotionally abusing me for months, and generally feel like they have been taking advantage of the arrangement.

The silence is such a breath of fresh air after hearing their constant fights over most of this past year. Now I can go downstairs and eat lunch at a normal time instead of waiting for them to hopefully leave the house. I don't need to be constantly on edge for another explosion to come at me out of nowhere, and I am certainly happy to not raise my child in an environment where this kind of behavior is normalized. At least MIL got one thing right in the fight she initiated last night - once they move out, it will likely be several years before we see them again.",40,1769199428.0,workingmoms,4,0.95,False
1ql1okg,https://i.redd.it/sixi8l03q5fg1.jpeg,Day #5 on the pill - This thing is no joke,"My doctor and I have been skeptical about the pill's efficacy, and this may all be placebo, but to me the pill is no joke. It's only day five for me but it's really packing a punch. 



**PROS**

The food noise is gone (at least I think it is). I have had no temptation to eat poorly, binge, or order Doordash. I haven't wanted a real meal in the last few days. When I've tried to eat one, I can only get through about 1/3 of it. I usually inhale my food, but it's been taking quite a bit of time to finish eating. 

Strangely, the idea of eating has disgusted me at times. I went out to get coffee/dessert with a friend on day two, and only got through two bites of it before I pushed the plate away. I just stared at it thinking ""I have no desire to eat this. I'm getting sick just looking at it."" I pushed the plate away and wasn't even tempted to go back for a second try. As a binge eater who always empties her plate, this has NEVER happened to me before. 



**CONS (depending on how you look at it)**  
As mentioned above, I haven't really been able to stomach a real meal.  I've been surviving on bananas, fruit smoothies, yogurt and protein shakes as they're the only things I can really stomach. It's gotten to the point that I've had to force myself to get something down, even when I'm not hungry. 

I constantly feel a vomity sensation in my chest/throat, but I also have GERD so the pill may just be exacerbating it. The cold smoothies and Tums have helped somewhat, will try some probiotics to see if that helps. I'm forcing myself to drink water so I don't get dehydrated and to help soothe some of the acidity. The nausea/heartburn is almost unbearable, but it's keeping my appetite in check so I'm determined to power through it. 

  
Overall, I'm thrilled that I'm feeling the pill work this quickly. I have a scale coming soon and look forward to seeing the progress/sharing with you all. Feel free to ask me questions! ",4,1769199398.0,WegovyPillWeightLoss,3,1.0,False

I asked if anything negative stood out and they replied with this 

“ Ithink some people naturally give off a warm-natured personality, and some don’t. It’s difficult too when you are interviewing and you want to be viewed as professional. Find a way to make the process fun and invite people into your head. It puts you on their level and eases the tension that surrounds interviews. Usually, I treat interviews like coffee with friends.
