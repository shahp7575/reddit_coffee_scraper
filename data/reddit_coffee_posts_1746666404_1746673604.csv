1khg1ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbancarliving/comments/1khg1ju/tipsmy_account_what_i_learned_so_far_from/,(Tips/My Account) What I learned so far from carliving in Cali!,"Twoish months in. First few weeks sucked ass.

I'd wake up and, once that hazy transition between being asleep and awake wore off, I'd remember, damn, I really live in my car now, what the fuck has my life become? I'd dwell in that mood of not belonging daily and project it everywhere, like, oh, everyone knows and is judging me and I can't stay in one place for too long and I have to be extra careful and extra kind and yada yada. I was about as paranoid as cat on crack lol.

It hasnt gone away completely, but I definitely got used to it once I found a routine and some sleeping/chilling spots to rotate between. Here's my routine in case anyone is curious.

First things first, when I wake up in the mornings, I doordash until the library opens. I stay at the library from opening (9amsish) to closing (5pmish). This is where I get all my productive shit done and out of the way. I put my electronics to charge, write, read, study, apply for jobs, read some more, take a snack break, read, and boom, closing time. I end up chilling in my car in the library parking for an hour or so after closing to kill time and what not. After that, I drive to a nearby river and connect with nature, clearing my head, going for a walk, taking a swim, fishing, chilling in my car, and doomscrolling haha. And when the sun sets, it's time to either DoorDash some more or drive to Planet Fitness to workout, shower, and, again, charge my electronics. Finally, I drive to either a rest area or residential area where my car can blend in and I hit the hay. I found rest areas to be the most comfortable.

I make sure rotate libraries, rest areas, residential areas, gyms, and rivers. I don't really have to, but 1) I live in an area with many in close proximity and 2) it just makes me feel less paranoid and at ease.

Dreaded encounters with the cops usually only happen when I'm parked in a public parking lot or when I'm driving at night. If I get approached or pulled over I either tell them 1) I'm doordashing and waiting for orders to come in and I show them the app, or 2) I tell them I lost track of time after shopping or eating, and I keep a souvenir from a nearby restaurant or grocery store, usually a bag pulled from the trash or a meal I bought just to subtly show them I'm here for a purpose. I avoid cop encounters by not driving for too long or by not parking at public parking lots and instead doing what I mentioned in my daily routine.

For food, I live in Norcal and found shopping at Grocery Outlet and Dollar Tree is the best option for cheap and somewhat healthy food and drinks. Grocery Outlets often have great deals too. Yesterday, I found $0.79 Chamberlain coffee cans with 70ish MG of caffeine, a small $0.79 ham packet, a $1.10 water gallon jug, $2 Ghost Protein cereal, and a ton of other shit.

What else, what else, hmmm...

On keeping my car clean: I keep a scrub brush for the carpets because I dont wanna keep paying for vacuum hoses; I keep a trash bag in the backseat; I give my car free washes with gas station squeegees when pumping gas; I keep all my bags and clothes and belongings and whatnot in the trunk, out of sight, so no one suspects I live in here; I wet a rag and add a bit a soap to clean the dash boards and plastic upholstery; this isn't really necessary and they are a bit expensive (like 4ish dollars) but I keep a fabric spray on me at all times to spray the seats and headliner and keep my car smelling clean because little shit like that goes a long way for my mental health... also because a cop once pulled me over for having a fucking scent tree hanging on the rear view lmfao.

On keeping good mental health: I vent via my creative writing from time to time; I found having a purpose, a goal to chase, and pursuing it relentlessly helps me when I'm feeling down, and that goal is writing for me; I turn my phone off and spend time in nature, jumping in cold river water is like a mental reset fr fr, being surrounded by trees and smelling fresh cold oxygen is also great, stepping barefeet in grass or sand or slimy underwater pebbles/rocks is grounding; working out helps me feel good about myself; eating reletively healthy goes a long long way, trust me, that mind and body link is real, you are what you eat. And, overall, I try to spend as little time in my car as possible.

On my sex life because why not and I did see a few discussions about it: Yes, I'm sexually active, not as much as pre-carliving though. Yes, I fuck in my car. Fuck buying motels, I'm too broke for that lmfao. Also, carplay is not unheard of, especially if it's a one night stand late at night, you'd be surprised how many people are down for car sex, though, tbf, I am still young so that may be a factor. I sell them with a late night car drive where we listen to music and chat and vibe and then we find a place to park/sightsee and one thing leads to the back seat and boom. Limited positions though hahaha. So, yeah, carplay. I just don't tell them I live in my car and I keep myself clean/presentable ofc.

On hygiene: I shower at Planet Fitness and when I can't, I shower in the river lmfao. When I don't feel like showering, I clean myself with Dollar Tree washcloths. I pee and shit in fastfood restaurants (some are closed, but if I ask kindly and tell them I'm a doordasher, they give me the code), public restrooms (rivers, rest areas, and parks have public restrooms), and at Planet Fitness. I've never needed to shit late at night, but if I did, a 24-hour Planet Fitness or an always open rest area restroom would be the best bet. Use baby wipes btw! It's much cleaner! Obviously, I keep all other essentials like toothbrush, floss, deodorant, conditioner, soap, etc. I do my laundry at the laundromat, but tbh, I'm tempted to try washing my clothes old fashioned style in the river to see if I can save money, idk.

Uhhh, what else... Yeah that's all I can think of for now. Hope this helps anyone!!",1,1746673318.0,urbancarliving,0,1.0,False

These type of posts helped me a lot in planning my trip, so paying it forward! 6 day solo trip from 4/29-5/5
Day 1: Landed 4/29 about 12pm dropped off luggage and made my way to OSJ. Did Castillo San Felipe del Morro. Absolutely beautiful! Went back to hotel for lunch and check in—stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn San Juan Condado. Got freshened up and went to dinner at Santaella. The quesadilla appetizer was AMAZING. 
Day 2: Scheduled a tour of El Yunque that was unfortunately cancelled, I’m assuming because of weather as it rained on and off the whole week I was there. Pivoted and did the Museo de Arte Puerto Rico. If you’re an art enthusiast even a little bit, I highly recommend! Absolutely beautiful and so much to see. I was there about 2 hours, I probably could’ve spent another two just taking everything in. Had lunch at Bebo’s cafe and was probably the best I had the whole trip. The pernils were out of this world! Spent the rest of the evening at the pool at the hotel enjoying the beautiful weather.
Day 3: booked an early ferry to Vieques, took an  uber to Ceiba—ferry was a very straightforward process. After arriving in Vieques, picked up my jeep rental and grabbed some breakfast at Kristy’s cafe. I highly recommend renting a jeep for getting around the island, I couldn’t imagine trying to get around without it. The roads are super uneven and tough to drive on, it would have been extremely difficult in something else. It was raining most of the morning, but once it cleared up a bit I headed to Sun Bay Beach. It was nice, stayed for a bit and swam and hung out, then moved to Playa Caracas. Caracas was absolutely stunning, definitely the most beautiful beach of my stay. After I checked into my hotel Old Crow Hotel and Suites. Super centrally located and beautiful property, a nice kitchenette that would have been helpful if I was staying longer and a whole patio with a Mountain View. I did dinner at Duffy’s and did the bio bay tour. Not only was the bio bay really cool but it was also incredible to see the sky with no light pollution as well. All the stars were so bright. 
Day 4: had a somewhat early ferry, so checked out of Old Crow and dropped off jeep. Got a pastellito and coffee at Panaderia Lydia by the ferry station that was delicious! After the ferry I was able to easily get an uber to El Conquistador. They allowed me to check in early (around 12pm when check in is 4) and I had made a reservation for a massage at the spa. Super relaxing and enjoyable! That night was unfortunately rainy again so I got some room service and just enjoyed an evening in the room. 
Day 5: woke up early for breakfast at Ventanas on the property and took the funicular to the water park. Despite it being small I spent several hours there taking turns relaxing on the beach chairs/the infinity pool and taking the slides down and going round and round the lazy river. Then I moved to the main pool area and enjoyed the hot tub and the big pools and swim up bar. Then had a dinner at Sicilia with some pasta! 
Day 6: got a small breakfast and then took the ferry out to the private Palomino Island and enjoyed a full beach day there. The water was lovely and thankfully had a full day of sun. I wanted to get out of the resort to do Estación for dinner but unfortunately couldn’t secure a ride, so just did dinner by the pool. 
Day 7: checked out early and stored luggage at SJU in order to spend a few more hours in OSJ prior to my flight around 1pm. Got some breakfast at La Mallorca and just strolled around the town to see the architecture and a few more beautiful views. 

Just wanted to thank the kind regulars of this sub that helped me plan such a relaxing trip with tons of amazing things to do! I can’t wait to go back! ",1,1746673259.0,PuertoRicoTravel,0,1.0,False

But grabbing me at the drive thru window and telling me I am unappreciative of the work you and thousands of other nurses do was out of line. This is simply a reminder that the baristas WILL BE PUNISHED if we comp a coffee with (corporate words, not mine) “no Starbucks approved promotion.” It is not the baristas fault. If you are mad, which again I completely understand, message Starbucks. Call them out online. Don’t verbally, physically or in any way hurt a barista who is just trying to get a pay check over a free tall coffee. I want to stress that I don’t think every nurse would be this passionate/violent about the false advertising, I just want you to know that your average Starbucks barista has almost no say in the matter and doesn’t want to ruin your day, they simply don’t want to be written up or even fired over this topic.

# Why Thoughtful Matters: Avoiding Generic Last-Minute Mother’s Day Gifts

Photo by [RDNE Stock project](https://www.pexels.com/@rdne)

Mother’s Day isn’t just about giving a present — it’s about showing appreciation in a way that feels true to your relationship. While it’s tempting to grab flowers or a mug at the last minute, these fallback gifts are often forgotten as quickly as they’re unwrapped. The [best last-minute Mother’s Day gifts](https://amzn.to/4d3yQlQ) don’t have to be expensive or elaborate. What matters is the thought behind the gift, especially when time is short.

# The Problem with Rushed, Generic Gifts

Choosing a quick, standard gift — like grocery store flowers or a generic gift card — can unintentionally send the message that you ran out of ideas or simply forgot. No one wants Mom to feel like an afterthought. Gift-giving is a form of communication, and generic choices usually say, “I didn’t have time.”

* **Forgettable:** Mass-produced gifts don’t stand out. They usually gather dust or get re-gifted.
* **Impersonal:** A gift that doesn’t reflect your mom’s interests feels empty, even if it’s practical.
* **Lost Meaning:** The real value in a gift comes from the story or emotion attached. If you grab something in five minutes, there isn’t much to remember or cherish.

As highlighted by researchers in [“The hidden meaning of Mother’s Day gifts”](https://chicago.suntimes.com/other-views/2024/05/10/mothers-day-gift-daughters-moms-psychology-hidden-meanings-chih-ling-liu-robert-kozinets-the-conversation), even well-intentioned quick gifts can come off as generic if they don’t show real effort or connection.

# Why Thoughtful Choices Make an Impact

A thoughtful gift — no matter how quickly chosen — shows you pay attention. Moms can tell when you’ve picked a present just for them. It’s less about the dollars spent, more about the time and heart.

* **Shared Memories:** Items that reflect an inside joke or favorite tradition stand out.
* **Practicality with a Twist:** Useful gifts, like kitchen gifts for mom, are stronger when they clearly suit her needs or hobbies.
* **Personal Touches:** A quick customized note or photo print adds warmth to almost anything.

Even if you only have a couple of hours, you can find [unique Mother’s Day gift ideas that feel special](https://amzn.to/451v2zz). Many curated lists of practical Mother’s Day gifts focus on items that combine utility with a dash of personalization, so you don’t have to sacrifice meaning for speed. Check out these [“practical Mother’s Day gifts that are useful and thoughtful](https://amzn.to/3GJsITW)” for inspiration.

# Striking the Balance: Quick But Meaningful

If you’re tight on time, it’s still possible to hit both speed and significance. Here’s how:

1. **Think About Her Interests**: Jot down what she loves — gardening, coffee, baking, reading — and start there.
2. **Add a Personal Note**: A handwritten card changes even a simple gift into something memorable.
3. **Choose Quality over Quantity**: A single, well-chosen gift means more than a pile of stuff.
4. **Include a Shared Experience**: An IOU for breakfast together or a walk in the park can be more meaningful than a physical present.

For last-minute Mother’s Day gift ideas that check every box, browse curated guides like the [“best last-minute gifts”](https://amzn.to/3EYuQqg), which highlight presents you can buy today and get tomorrow — without feeling rushed.

Putting care into even a quick mothers day present sends the message that Mom truly matters. This is the heart of the search for the best gifts to get your mom and what makes the best first time mom gifts so personal. Thoughtful beats rushed — every single time.

1khfjti,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/1khfjti/solved_question_from_one_of_archived_reddit_posts/,Solved. Question from one of Archived reddit posts that went unanswered,"A client dropped coffee on the laptop and tried to clean it with a paper towel, but now the client is having problems with the cursor. You turn off the device to limit damage. What is the next thing you should do to continue troubleshooting the issue?

a. Quickly back up the data.

b. Remove the battery

c. Replace the keyboard

d. Let it dry for 24hrs

The correct answer is d. Let it dry for 24hrs.

After turning off the device to limit damage from the coffee spill, the next step is to let the laptop dry completely for at least 24 hours to prevent further damage from moisture. This ensures that no residual liquid causes short circuits or corrosion when the device is powered on again.

Here’s why the other options are not the best next step:

a. Quickly back up the data: Backing up data is important, but powering on the device before it’s fully dry could cause further damage, making this step premature.

b. Remove the battery: While removing the battery can help prevent electrical damage, it’s not always feasible (e.g., many modern laptops have non-removable batteries), and letting the device dry is a more universally applicable next step.

c. Replace the keyboard: Replacing the keyboard assumes the issue is isolated to it, but the cursor problem could stem from other components affected by the spill, and this step is too advanced without further diagnosis.

Letting it dry minimizes risk and is the safest immediate action before further troubleshooting.

Ever find yourself staring at your retirement plan like it’s an unsolved Rubik's cube? 🤔 Trust me, you’re not alone! One of the biggest decisions you’ll face as you approach that golden age of relaxation is—drumroll, please—what to do with your pension payout. Lump sum or monthly income? 

Let’s break it down together because this can feel like choosing between chocolate or vanilla ice cream (but hey, we can have both if we play our cards right). 🍦 

Here’s the scoop:

### **Lump Sum Pros & Cons**

**Pros:**
- **Big Picture Freedom:** You get **one big check**! Think of all the things you could fund: travel, starting a small business, or maybe that fancy car you’ve had your eye on. 🚗💨
- **Investment Opportunities:** You can invest that lump sum and potentially watch it grow (just remember, no one wants to invest all their savings into the next Beanie Baby craze). 

**Cons:**
- **Decision Overload:** With great power comes great responsibility. You’ll need to manage your funds wisely—no pressure, right? 
- **Risk of Running Out:** If you’re like me and have a penchant for long dinners out and spontaneous Europe trips, the thought of this can be a teensy bit scary. 🥖✈️

### **Monthly Income Pros & Cons**

**Pros:**
- **Steady Stream:** Think of it as your monthly coffee budget! You’ll have a **consistent paycheck** coming in, so you can plan your budget without breaking a sweat. ☕✨ 
- **Less Stress:** Reduces the “What if I run out of money” anxiety. Always a plus in my book.

**Cons:**
- **Less Flexibility:** You won't get to ride the financial roller coaster quite as much. No lump sums means you might miss out on larger opportunities. 
- **Inflation Worries:** Over time, those monthly payments may not stretch as far as they did when you first retired. Can you say *cost of living adjustments*? 

Just like they say, **“Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.”** (You can even check this out for a productivity boost: [Sunsama](https://try.sunsama.com/gdnn6ll0lczp)😉). Now, that’s a mindset for our retirement decisions too!

### **So, What’s the Game Plan?**
- **Do a Needs Assessment:** Honestly evaluate what your lifestyle will look like. Are you dreaming of extravagant travel, or is it more about peace and quiet with a cup of tea? ☕🧘‍♂️
- **Consult with Professionals:** No one has to navigate this maze alone. Get a good financial advisor who can break it down (without sounding like they’re speaking Martian).
- **Visualize Your Future:** Picture how you want to spend those years. You might find it leads you to one option or the other.

So, what do you think? Are you leaning towards a lump sum for that sweet freedom, or are you cozying up to the idea of a steady paycheck? Let’s chat about it! I’d love to hear your thoughts or personal stories on how you’re navigating this decision.",1,1746671519.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

1khfdyc,https://i.redd.it/mav9n718ugze1.jpeg,What do I do with the front of my long ranch house???,"This house came with a 10'x23' front deck that's rotting and will be torn out.  But we don't really use that space as a deck...likely only need 2 chairs and a little table out there for seating.  We DO use it to put firewood on in the winter as we partially heat with wood, though.  So, in the winter we stack our wood on it, and the rest of the year it's mainly used as a walkway to get from the front door to the driveway, and sometimes I sit out there with a book or some coffee.

In the front of the deck right now are some hostas and daylillies (weren't up yet when I took the photo).

That long wood box to the left of the front door is about a foot deep and did hold some tiny bushes...but the overhang of the roof is deep and about 3 feet, so any plants next to the house don't get rainwater and don't last long (I'm not going to remember to water anything there either).  So I haven't known what to do to make it look nicer.

The concrete ""sidewalk"" pad from the driveway to the deck currently slopes down toward the deck...hence water pooled under the deck and rotted the joists which sat right on the ground (plastic underneath it at least.)

I'm getting a quote for a new concrete sidewalk, so that it would slope toward the driveway (there is a channel drain between the sidewalk and the driveway).  Should I just forego a deck and have the sidewalk up against the house all the way to the front door?  Maybe have a concrete stoop that goes a little past the front door...and that's where I could put a couple chairs and small table??  And stack some wood there in the winter??  Should I replace the deck and make it smaller, with a longer sidewalk to meet it??

Maybe drier shade plants near the house to the left of the front door?  We're zone 6b, I think, and that's a pretty shaded area.

I don't have a lot of money to work with, so what are some budget ideas that give my home more curb appeal and also have at least a small place to sit and watch the sunrise?

- **62 years old**:  
  - *Pros*: Get your hands on that sweet cash sooner!  
  - *Cons*: You’re looking at a 25-30% reduction in monthly benefits. Ouch!  

- **Full Retirement Age (FRA)**:  
  - Depending on when you were born, this is between 66 and 67.  
  - *Pros*: You get all the money you’ve earned without penalties! 🎉  
  - *Cons*: You miss out on those early years of benefits.  

- **Delayed Retirement (up to 70)**:  
  - *Pros*: Every year you wait past your FRA adds about 8% to your monthly benefit. That’s a pretty nice return!  
  - *Cons*: You might have to hold off on those vacations to Hawaii a little longer.  

But wait! What about the *realistic goals* part? Setting those goals means weighing your current financial needs against future benefits. Ask yourself:

- Are you healthy enough to wait longer?
- Do you have other income sources?
- How do your retirement plans stack up against waiting for a bigger paycheck?

Sometimes, it’s not just about maximizing — it’s about what fits best for *you*.  

Life doesn’t always follow a script, right? There might be unexpected twists and turns, and maybe you’ll need that extra income sooner than you think. Just remember that your choice today shapes what your tomorrow looks like.

Also, keep an eye on *your satisfaction*. Financial stability can pave the way for a fulfilling retirement, full of travel, hobbies, or just hanging out with the grandkids. Because, let’s be real, who doesn’t want to sip coffee on a sunny porch and reminisce about their glory days? ☕️🌞

So what’s your game plan? Any strategies that worked for you or things you wished you’d known earlier? Let’s hear it!",1,1746671255.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

1khfd6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGroupChatWeekly/comments/1khfd6c/the_great_espresso_martini_incident/,The Great Espresso Martini Incident,"You’d think after living in New York for over three years, I’d stop agreeing to be the designated planner when friends visit. But no – I fall for it every time. “We’ll just keep it chill,” they say, which somehow translates to me making a color-coded itinerary and chasing down last-minute dinner reservations like it’s a competitive sport.

This time, two friends from high school were in town. I hadn’t seen them in forever, so I wanted the night to feel special. We started in the West Village – cute dinner, decent cocktails, all was well. Then came the idea to get espresso martinis “somewhere fun.” The kind of vague suggestion that always leads to chaos.

We ended up at this little bar in the East Village that someone found on TikTok. It was packed, hot, and loud. We squeezed into a corner table, immediately ordered three martinis, and tried to pretend we weren’t shouting to hear each other. That’s when things started going south.

One of my friends, trying to squeeze past the tiny table, knocks over *two* of the drinks – one into my lap, one directly onto a stranger’s sleeve. He gave us that look. You know the one. I went into auto-apology mode, trying to blot my pants with a bar napkin while also explaining to this poor guy that we were, in fact, not always like this.

Meanwhile, my other friend is laughing to the point of tears, which only makes it worse. I didn’t know whether to laugh or leave. So I sat there, coffee-soaked, in mild disbelief, trying to decide if I could salvage the night or if we should just call it.

We called it.

Later that night, back in my apartment, I realized how fast a night can unravel in this city – and how being around old friends kind of takes you revert back to your 19-year-old self. You forget how to act normal in public. You forget you’re wearing white pants. You forget that not everything has to be perfect for it to still be a good story.

So yeah, I was a little embarrassed. But honestly? I’d still do it again. Maybe just next time in darker jeans.

With love and mild regret,

Some observations:

This was my 5th trip to the state of Hawaii and my third island (Maui thrice, Kauai and Hawaii). I do not island hop so each island I've visited was its own vacation, not that I have anything against that, I just personally don't do it. 

Hawaii is expensive across the board but the Big Island was the *least* expensive if that's even a thing. Kauai was the most expensive and Maui was closer to Kauai in terms of cost. 

In my opinion, Maui has the best dining options across all tiers (casual dining to fine dining), Kauai was the quietest and the Big Island the most diverse (as in things to see and do). They are all beautiful in their own right however, and I would never tell someone to pick an island based on my opinion. Do your research, ask questions, and then make a decision based on your likes/wants. Where the three islands I've visited are concerned, there is no wrong answer. My island might not be your island, or, the island that vibes with me the most, may not vibe with you at all. This is real.

Having said that, Hawaii is a special place with special people who have managed to maintain their culture and history despite how it all went down. One would do themselves a service by exploring each island and listening to their stories.

I did a million things during my time on the Big Island and while there were a million more left to do, at some point, you call it a trip and thank the universe that you're in a position to fly 4,500 miles to the most magical place, which is exactly what I did.

Up next will be a trip to Oahu. I'm really excited about it but first, I need to pay some bills. lol

Thank you for reading.

PS, I got gas at Costco for $3.85, I saw $4.15 - $4.53 elsewhere throughout the island. 

PPS, I am really bummed I didn't get to Huggo's. That's going to irk me forever. ",3,1746670781.0,VisitingHawaii,2,0.71,False

# What Is ShineOn Star – Anna Beck?

If you’ve ever dreamed of launching a jewelry business from your laptop, then **ShineOn Star – Anna Beck** might just be your golden ticket. This online course is a step-by-step guide that shows you exactly how to go from zero to sales in just 30 days—selling ShineOn products on the world’s biggest marketplace: Amazon. It’s built to help you start fast, skip the overwhelm, and build something that lasts. Oh, and it’s fun. Seriously.

# Who Is It For?

This one’s for you if you’re:

* A total beginner looking to start an e-commerce side hustle.
* Someone who’s tired of the guesswork with Amazon and wants a system that *actually works*.
* Or even an Etsy seller wanting to expand without doubling the workload.

**Anna Beck** speaks directly to anyone who’s ever asked, *“What do I do next?”*—because she’s been there. So whether you’re a busy parent, 9-to-5er, or late-night side hustler, this course is tailored to fit your real life.

# Why It Works

Here’s the thing: a lot of courses dump you with info and leave you to figure it out. Not this one.

**ShineOn Star – Anna Beck** breaks things down with her FLOW Formula—a simple structure that shows you how to set up on Amazon, create products that people actually want, and scale like a boss. Plus, she gives you shortcuts and pro tips she’s used herself to hit over $100k in 5 months. That’s not fluff. That’s proof.

# What You’ll Learn

Let’s unpack it real quick:

# 🔹 Module 1: The Foundation

This module is like your eComm starter pack. Learn how to pick a brand name, set up your ShineOn seller accounts, get that all-important UPC exemption (trust me, this is gold), and create a logo in 15 minutes or less.

# 🔹 Module 2: Create Winning Products

Anna shows you how to craft message cards that *actually sell*. She’ll help you research keywords, uncover untapped niches, and write product phrases that go from “meh” to “YES PLEASE.” Plus, you’ll design with Canva like a total pro.

# 🔹 Module 3: Outshine Your Competition

Learn how to write killer product descriptions, collect 5-star reviews, bring customers back, and—most importantly—scale your winners. She even gives you tricks for when sales slow down (because yes, that happens too).

# Where Does It Happen?

All online, baby! The **ShineOn Star – Anna Beck** course is completely digital. You get lifetime access and can go at your own pace, from wherever you are. Pajamas? Coffee shop? Doesn’t matter. You’re in control.

# When Should You Start?

Now. Seriously. One of Anna’s best lines is:

>

Starting today means you’re that much closer to your first sale—and trust me, that first “cha-ching” hits different.

# How Is It Different?

It’s practical. It’s real. And it’s built by someone who’s *done it*. Anna doesn’t just teach—she shares the exact methods she used to blow up her own ShineOn business. Plus, she gives you Etsy strategies as a bonus, so you’re not just building one stream of income—you’re creating a whole ecosystem.

**Bottom line?**  
If you’re looking for a no-fluff, easy-to-follow roadmap to start selling ShineOn jewelry on Amazon (and beyond), **ShineOn Star – Anna Beck** delivers in a big way.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Me 23M and my friend 22F have been friends for maybe 2 years. a year ago i stopped talking to her bc my ex gf wanted me too. i obliged and stopped texting her. so fast forward we broke up. we have liked eachother briefly as well. but never did anything.

I offered my friend to an apology and she said she would hear me out, i have offered once prior but she ignored me. But fast forward on that coffee meetup, it turned into us drinking. she accepted my apology clearly. (also i’ve slept in the same bed as her probs 3-4 times, never did anything no cuddle nothing) then, eventually she offers that i stay the night that i live far i didn’t think much of it.  but then eventually i kissed her that night bc she was cuddling me, then we hung out the next weekend. stayed the night, didn’t kiss but we cuddled, i kissed her the next morning. we talked, she said i could of fucked her the first time we hung out, that was a CURVEBALL, we discussed that we both aren’t ready for a relationship right away but ig we’re open to see where it went.

Now, my dilemma is. She hasn’t texted me back in two days, i came out of a bad relationship where i put in a lot of effort just to get abused. So im just very confused, maybe it’s because finals are coming up. But me personally, i feel like if you like someone you should want to text them. not every second of every min. maybe every couple of hours. and i’m thinking that idk if i want that in my life. I just went through a lot of wondering if my own ex gf liked me for a LONG time (she obv didn’t love me) and i just don’t want to go through it again, im probably tweaking but i just don’t want to live in “does she like me” state of mind anymore and quite frankly this makes me want to cut her off even as a friend. but i guess my ultimate question is, has anyone ever liked someone before and not texted or called daily? My own friend said im tweaking a little which i agree, but idk. i just don’t like gray areas. ill def talk to her soon to lay more stricter boundaries.

1kheyd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kheyd2/m28_met_f31_at_work_she_liked_me_then/,"M/28 met F/31 at work, she liked me, then disappeared—what happened?","TL;DR: Met a girl at work, we hit it off, and things seemed good. She told me she liked me, then suddenly became distant and said she didn’t want anything. Three months later, I found out she was in a relationship with someone else. I’m confused about what happened.

I (M/28) met a girl (F/31) at work in February of last year, and we hit it off right away. We started talking every day, exchanging messages, and meeting up for coffee a few times. Things were intensifying, and eventually, I told her that I liked her. She told me that she liked me too, and even said I was a good influence in her life and that she was really happy to have me. We saw each other often, and everything seemed to be going well.

However, almost suddenly, her tone changed completely. She told me she needed space, and the messages became more distant. She would take a long time to respond, when before it was just minutes. If I didn’t text first, days would go by without hearing from her. I’d invite her for coffee, but she’d always say she couldn’t, either because she had other plans or things to do at home. She also started getting upset over small, insignificant things—things that weren’t an issue before.

At the beginning of April, she told me she didn’t want anything with me. After that, she acted like nothing had happened between us when we were at work, while I was absolutely miserable every time I saw her. By the beginning of May, I had left the company, and I never spoke to her again. Three months later, I found out through a mutual colleague that she was in a relationship with another guy (M/34).

I keep wondering if I did something wrong, but I know I was honest and gave her the space she asked for. I don’t understand how someone can say they’re happy to have someone in their life and then suddenly disappear without any explanation. I feel confused, and I’m not sure if I misread things or if she just didn’t know what she wanted.

Has anyone gone through something like this? How did you deal with it? I feel like I’m losing the desire to meet anyone again, but at the same time, I’d like to understand what’s going on in situations like this.

Mark is a prankster. Like, the kind of guy who puts salt in your coffee “as a joke” and thinks fake lottery tickets are peak comedy. I’ve told him multiple times that I’m not into pranks, especially ones that are embarrassing or public. He always says I need to “Chill out.”

Anyway, a few weeks ago we went to dinner with his family. Fancy restaurant, white tablecloths, the whole thing. Midway through dessert, he starts tapping his glass and stands up. I immediately tense because he gets that look, the one he gets before doing something dumb.

Then he says, “Everyone… I have a question for the love of my life.” He turns to me, gets down on one knee, and pulls out… a Ring Pop.

Everyone laughs. I blink. He says, “Just kidding!” and pulls out an actual ring.

Here’s the thing. Because of the Ring Pop and his history of dumb stunts, I genuinely thought this was still part of the joke. Like he was going to fake me out with a real ring, then be like, “Haha, gotcha!” and say he’s just practicing or something. So I laughed nervously and said:

“Yeah, okay, nice one. Let me know when the real proposal happens.”

His face. Dropped.

Turns out he was serious. He sat back down humiliated, and the rest of the dinner was awkward silence. Later, in the car, he told me I’d “crushed him,” that I “humiliated him in front of his parents,” and that I “proved I wasn’t ready for marriage.” I apologized and tried to explain that it was a genuine misunderstanding because he conditioned me to expect a prank. He didn’t buy it.

Now he’s staying at his brother’s place “to think,” and his mom texted me that I embarrassed their whole family and made a “mockery of a sacred moment.”

So… AITA for thinking my boyfriend’s actual proposal was a joke?

I'm getting there and getting some delicious shots as a result, if I'm not kidding myself. Using this technique it is possible to start with \~1 bar preinfusion and apply full pressure when drips appear.

# What's the Deal with ""Sedona Method – The Money Course – Hale Dwoskin""?

If you’ve ever felt like money runs your life—constantly chasing it, fearing it, obsessing over it—you’re not alone. That’s exactly the kind of mindset that *Hale Dwoskin* aims to shift with **Sedona Method – The Money Course**. This 12-session audio program isn't about get-rich-quick schemes or budgeting tips. It’s deeper. It's about your inner relationship with money—and how shifting that can bring more financial peace (and actual results).

# Who’s Behind It?

The course is led by *Hale Dwoskin*, one of the main voices behind the **Sedona Method**, a powerful emotional release technique developed from Lester Levenson’s teachings. If you're not familiar with this method, it's all about letting go of limiting beliefs and stuck emotions. In this money-focused version, Hale helps you peel away old baggage around wealth, lack, and worthiness.

# Why Should You Even Care?

Let’s be honest: most of us are *weird* about money. We want it. We hate needing it. We chase it, then feel bad for wanting more. The **Sedona Method – The Money Course** zooms in on that weirdness and helps you release it. The idea is, once you stop wrestling with money emotionally, it can start flowing into your life with less effort and more joy.

Plus, money is everywhere—it’s a part of nearly every choice we make. So if your internal compass is constantly stressing about it, wouldn’t it be nice to shift that?

# What’s Inside the Course?

You get 12 audio sessions—each one guiding you to look at money from a different angle. There’s stuff on releasing your fear of lack, letting go of money shame, dealing with self-worth, embracing abundance, and even forgiving yourself for past financial mistakes. It's not preachy; it's introspective and chill. And the audio format makes it super easy to follow along—just press play and listen.

Some standout sessions include:

* *“Money is Just a Word”* – stripping away emotional charge from the idea of money.
* *“Lust is a Bust”* – tackling that never-enough, always-hustling feeling.
* *“You Are Enough”* – connecting self-worth with financial ease.

# Where Can You Use It?

Anywhere, really. Car rides, morning walks, or just relaxing on the couch. What’s cool is that the course isn’t trying to “teach” in a traditional sense. It’s more of a guided emotional detox for your money mindset. So it’s practical for both entrepreneurs and everyday folks stuck in financial stress.

# When Do You Start Seeing Results?

It's not instant coffee, but some people report shifts even after a couple sessions. The method works by gently dissolving inner resistance. So if you’re consistent—even casually—you may notice money feels less heavy and more natural. You may start saying ""yes"" to opportunities or pricing your work with more confidence.

# How Does It Really Help?

Think of it like spring cleaning for your money beliefs. **Sedona Method – The Money Course – Hale Dwoskin** helps clear out the emotional gunk so you can stop sabotaging yourself. It’s not about hustling harder—it’s about allowing more. And that's what makes it refreshingly different from most “money mindset” stuff out there.",1,1746669504.0,VosiLearning,1,1.0,False

Today, as a member of my local Chamber of Commerce, I attended our local 'Government Relations Meeting'. A forum our Congressman's District Representative normally attends and provides updates and fields questions. District Representative, Jack Thompson, had previously hung up on our first scheduled phone meeting, and I've not received any response to my questions submitted weeks ago.

Yesterday I reached the office of the Congressman's Legislative Director, James Zandstra, who claimed to not be able to confirm the Congressman's stance on U.S. tariffs nor could he confirm if any reversal/relief should be expected. And when pressed that our business is facing dire uncertainty amongst our projects and staff...he hung up.

(TLDR: With our U.S. business at a complete standstill due to inability to import at 145% tariffs - we're in desperate need of guidance from our Congressman about what to expect moving forward on trade.)

The response today was disheartening, insensitive, and left me feeling even less hopeful. It is paraphrased below:

1. Congressman Kiley's Director of Operations & Scheduling emailed me this morning, with Jack Thompson CC'd, stating he was the person I'm supposed to schedule meetings with.
2. After his presentation and plugging that the office is there to help with any federal policy matters we have as Chamber members, District Rep Jack Thompson attempted to avoid my public question leaving the podium after making eye contact. I was the sole question in the room and directly in front of him.
3. When brought to his attention by those in attendance, he yielded to my question and publicly committed to scheduling a meeting with me today.
4. In private, the District Representative told me he had neither his calendar or phone on him and was not in a position to schedule a future meeting.
5. Congressman Kiley's District Rep said I could not stop by the office and schedule with him later today as he has other obligations to attend to.
6. He made a joke about financial bribery in an alleged attempt to bring ""levity"" in my desperation and offer to meet locally, in DC, over coffee or lunch, etc.
7. He refused to take copies of our products to the Congressman's office as examples of goods we are producing internationally. I'd brough several to lend as examples.
8. After many attempts to insist he had my info and would contact me eventually, he finally committed to CALLING me by end of Friday to SCHEDULE a FUTURE meeting.

UPDATE: In the midst of writing this post (and after sharing this encounter across social media elsewhere), I've just received an email from Jack Thompson offering a meeting with himself here locally on May 22nd, a month after our first phone meeting in which I was hung up on, and still have not received answers.

I have replied in good faith and hope to get some clarity on what to expect from this meeting, and will provide updates as I receive them. My expectations are sadly incredibly low based on our interaction today.

\----------------------------

My previously submitted, and still unanswered, questions for the Congressman's office:

1. Has Congressman Kiley received my messages, or listened to my story, and if so what is his response?
2. Does congressman Kiley understand the damage that U.S. tariffs impose on U.S. small businesses?
3. Does Congressman Kiley support the volatility we've seen with trade, and the 145% import tariffs on U.S. small businesses who manufacture with China?
4. Does Congressman Kiley feel he has any responsibility to rein in President Trump on U.S. volatile trade policy?
5. What advice does Congressman Kiley have for our small business, currently sitting on \~$1.2M in products already produced in China?
6. Our products can't currently be made in the USA. What actions is Kevin Kiley taking to invest federal funding into domestic manufacturing?
7. Can I receive a call, or set up a meeting with, the Congressman?

UPDATE: In the midst of writing this post (and after sharing this encounter across social media elsewhere), I've just received an email from Jack Thompson offering a meeting with himself here locally on May 22nd, a month after our first phone meeting in which I was hung up on, and still have not received answers.

I have replied in good faith and hope to get some clarity on what to expect from this meeting, and will provide updates as I receive them. My expectations are sadly incredibly low based on our interaction today.

\----------------------------

My previously submitted, and still unanswered, questions for the Congressman's office:

1. Has Congressman Kiley received my messages, or listened to my story, and if so what is his response?
2. Does congressman Kiley understand the damage that U.S. tariffs impose on U.S. small businesses?
3. Does Congressman Kiley support the volatility we've seen with trade, and the 145% import tariffs on U.S. small businesses who manufacture with China?
4. Does Congressman Kiley feel he has any responsibility to rein in President Trump on U.S. volatile trade policy?
5. What advice does Congressman Kiley have for our small business, currently sitting on \~$1.2M in products already produced in China?
6. Our products can't currently be made in the USA. What actions is Kevin Kiley taking to invest federal funding into domestic manufacturing?
7. Can I receive a call, or set up a meeting with, the Congressman?

1khepv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GallberryCountyTales/comments/1khepv7/stretching_room/,Stretching Room,"The basement of the Gallberry County Courthouse had always smelled like wet limestone and pine-tar disinfectant, but tonight the air carried something extra—an undertone of river-mud, the kind that clings long after you’ve hosed off your boots. I told myself it was only the Choctawhatchee’s flood-swollen breath curling through the cracked windowpanes, yet the hush that hung over the county above my head seemed to have seeped down here and thickened.

I’d driven in from Montgomery that afternoon to relieve old Doc Millard, whose heart finally gave up after seventy-two years of signing death certificates. Sheriff Sutton met me on the courthouse steps, handed me a tarnished key ring, and said, “Ellis, nothing down there bites as hard as the living. Keep it locked anyway.” His voice scratched like gravel under a truck tire, but his eyes flicked toward the river as if expecting it to spit up something worse than a corpse.

The body in Drawer 6 had washed ashore at Black Dog Bridge—the same bridge where Hank Ryles vanished eight years ago, the same bridge folks still crossed with their radios turned up to drown the silence. No ID yet. Male, mid-thirties, water-logged but oddly unblemished, fingers pruned pale as catfish bellies. I logged him as “John Doe, BDB” on the clipboard, slid the drawer shut, and locked up for the night.

Or so I thought.



Midnight brought thunder, the kind that rattles window glass in its frame. Power flickered, the fluorescent tubes overhead stuttering to life and death like a preacher unsure of his sermon. I threw the main breaker twice before the lights steadied, and that’s when I noticed the cold-metal aroma—sharp, clean, wrong. Even before I walked to the wall of refrigerated drawers, I knew which one would be open.

Drawer 6 yawned empty.

Yet the stainless-steel rails weren’t dry as they’d been at dusk. Tiny crescents of condensed breath and smears like something had pressed up from inside beaded under the light—fresh, moist fingerprints trailing along the tray until they vanished halfway across the tile floor.

For a moment I convinced myself the flood water had thawed latent condensate, that metal sweats same as men when the night goes strange. Then the morgue door’s latch clicked behind me.

I turned slowly, clipboard raised like a cardboard shield. The man from Drawer 6 stood barefoot in the doorway. River silt mottled his calves, and hair the color of Spanish moss clung to his cheekbones. Blue lips parted, revealing teeth polished glossy by the river’s grind.

“Thanks,” he whispered, voice papery as dried kudzu leaves. “Needed to stretch.”

My breath snapped white in the morgue’s sudden chill. “You’re… alive?”

“Not exactly.” He flexed his fingers—water dripped from the creases—and traced the rusted edge of the doorframe as if feeling for a pulse in the building itself. “But I remember you, Ellis Macon. Last time we met, you were louder. Bonfire on the sandbar, guitars, that old river hymn y’all butchered.”

Memory lanced me: senior year, we’d rafted kegs downstream, daring the dark to catch us. A stranger drifted past the firelight, mouth full of river weeds, begging for help in a voice half water, half wind. We laughed him off as swamp-gas hallucination—just another Gallberry tale come calling. By dawn he was gone, and we told ourselves it had been the rye.

“You were singing ‘I’ll Fly Away,’” he said, stepping closer. The morgue floor pooled with gloomy footprints. “I thought maybe you’d ferry me across. You didn’t.”

“Who are you?”

“Just another thing y’all left in the water.”

Lightning cracked; bulbs flared and died, plunging us into dim backup glow. Drawer 6’s interior light still burned, a rectangle of sick amber. The corpse—or whatever animated it—glanced toward it the way a hound checks its chain length. Something, maybe the hush of Gallberry itself, held him tethered to that drawer.

I edged sideways, trying to place cold steel between us. “Sheriff Sutton will be here any minute.”

“Sheriff’s out at Possum Fork, rounding up drunks who saw the river walking.” The man smiled—an expression too slow, too heavy for human cheeks. “Night’s ours, Ellis. The river always comes to collect.”

His damp fingers brushed a pathology saw on the instrument tray. Metal rasped. I lunged for the adjoining locker, yanked open Drawer 5, and shoved the tray out as a shield. The deceased within—Mrs. Alma Jo Hightower, ninety-four—slid halfway into view, eyes clouded but open. Her jaw sagged as though about to scold me for disturbing her eternal rest.

The river-man paused, recognition flickering. Soft as a lullaby, he hummed the tune of “I’ll Fly Away.” Alma Jo’s lips twitched. I felt the courthouse foundation tremor—a deep, throaty shift—as if Gallberry itself drew a breath.

I did the only thing that makes sense in a county where lights bob through pine thickets and bridges swallow boys: I sang.

My voice cracked on the first line, but the hymn spilled out, rough and desperate. The morgue walls amplified it into a cavern-choir wail. Drawer 5 rattled; Alma Jo’s hands lifted, bones thin as sparrow legs. Something behind me thumped within other drawers, as though long-locked knees were unbending.

Maybe memory was all it took to weigh the river down again. 
The river-man’s smile collapsed. Moisture coursed down his temples like sweat from a fever dream. He backed toward his drawer, each step an effort, as if unseen hooks reeled him in. “Stop.”

I sang louder.

Bulbs burst in starbursts of glass. Cold vapor roared from every gasket. Drawer doors cracked open an inch, exhaling earthy, sweet decay. Yet none spilled free—every corpse merely shifted, turning their clouded eyes toward the river-man.

He stumbled against Drawer 6. The interior light flared. “Ellis,” he pleaded, voice dissolving into gurgle, “carry me across.”

“You had your ferry,” I rasped, throat raw. “You let go.”

With a final shudder, he folded hiss-silent into the tray. I slammed it shut and threw the lever. The backup generator whined down; night settled, thick as blackstrap molasses.



Dawn’s first light found me sitting on the courthouse steps, hymn still rattling in my ribcage. Sheriff Sutton pulled up, coffee steaming in his hand. He took one look at my mud-streaked shoes and said, “River spit something out again, didn’t it?”

I couldn’t speak, only nodded. He offered the cup; I wrapped my shaking fingers around the heat.

“Gallberry keeps its own score,” he muttered. “But gospel’s a fair currency.”

Somewhere below our boots, refrigeration compressors kicked on, steady as a hymn’s refrain. I wondered how long before the county demanded another toll—how many more drawers held passengers waiting for someone to sing.

Behind the courthouse, the Choctawhatchee slipped past, its surface unbroken save for a single, widening ripple—no wind, no rain, just something deep remembering the way back up. ",2,1746669192.0,GallberryCountyTales,0,1.0,False

And all we do as Humans and plants and bacteria here is just slowing down the Entropy for some determined future of our reality: Heat Death. Slowing it down and riding the wave of entropy, borrowing some energy from the Sun to manipulate it a bit and turn into a cup of coffee or a girlfriend. To enjoy life a bit. So all we get literally comes from the Sun and we are all its creations. Creating dramaturgical potential, our personal one, for some of the general steps of reality. In a given location of space-time.

https://preview.redd.it/nwws9fgwpgze1.png?width=1752&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8f6fe779abc8f07bd29593fc885dbfd2279c331

It's common knowledge that the sun showers Earth with an immense amount of energy, from the visible light we see to various forms of electromagnetic radiation. Our atmosphere and surface absorb a significant portion of this energy, driving processes like photosynthesis, weather patterns, and the overall vitality of our planet.

But here's where it gets interesting: Sun produces all energy and matter we are using and consist of. We are maximum united with it. In our modern world we created so many games we forgot about the main cause of all of them, the Sun. Sun has a story, and it transmits its story forward in time. Because of fundamental law of Entropy. And our life stories and all our problems and accomplishments are always only a substories of the main one: the Sun. It has all answers.

https://preview.redd.it/ul8z3x0ypgze1.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee82309dbcf00d0540a3c0fee440801b373c9b12

 Entropy, a concept deeply rooted in the second law of thermodynamics, suggests that systems tend to move towards in a state of disorder or randomness. In the case of Earth and the sun's energy, this law implies that the absorbed energy isn't indefinitely stored or utilized within our planet.

So, how does the Earth loose energy? One major mechanism is through the reradiation of energy back into space. The Earth, being warmer than the frigid vacuum of space, emits infrared radiation. This outbound radiation carries away a substantial portion of the absorbed solar energy, maintaining a balance. 

https://preview.redd.it/wm0ay9ezpgze1.png?width=2036&format=png&auto=webp&s=9231e2aca773c152d1ce6e2ab3e6ed18eadfc109

Ultimately, a fraction of the sun's energy doesn't just bounce back into space directly from Earth's surface. Some of it is utilized in driving various Earthly processes, but a significant portion finds its way back into the cosmic void.

Plants are remarkable organisms practice a form of alchemy known as photosynthesis, where they harness the sun's energy, combining it with water and carbon dioxide to create a magical elixir – glucose. 

https://preview.redd.it/bmro7w60qgze1.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=de69feb78cb0c6dc29b95c3a423588e5224cae4c

Contrary to popular belief, plants are selective about their recipe for glucose. While they do extract some minerals from the soil, the primary ingredients are **sunlight** and water. Through the miraculous process of photosynthesis, plants convert solar energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, essentially creating their own form of solar batteries.

  The structures of plants, from leaves to stems, act as reservoirs for this stored solar energy. Think of them as living batteries, charged by the sun. This energy-rich compound, glucose, becomes the currency that powers various cellular processes within the plant.

Here's where it gets fascinating. When we burn wood or other plant material, we're essentially releasing the stored solar energy in the form of heat and light.

https://preview.redd.it/ttda4tr1qgze1.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbb2861e05350a8180e95c8f8f5b6e8ce73ce00c

This process, although ancient, is a tangible manifestation of the sun's energy returning to the environment. It's a beautiful reminder that the energy we use for warmth and light has ancient origins.

   Beyond direct combustion, the journey of solar energy extends to more complex forms. Plants, over millions of years, transform into fossil fuels like coal and oil. These fuels, when burned, release the stored sunlight in a manner that sustained Earth's ecosystems long before humans arrived on the scene.

So if we look at all of this through process philosophy, and especially computational dramaturgy, you can say “Sun plays stories of our lives”. Because it gives energy that is washed away in time, but we surf it on a surfboard of a free will. Creating an illusion of consciousness and a free choice. Remaining the part of a fully computational world.

   If you are a fed up with life clerk or a big Boss that punishes his enemies, remember, you still only have time and energy for that because you are literally fed and created by the sun. Visible light from the Sun shapes your desires and its energy made your hot bathtub hot.

  This kind world perception, when you are not a main character is very healthy and saves a lot of money used for drugs from anxiety. Relax, you are not important. Enjoy life.

Here are sources from SSRN and Wikipedia with some wild thought experiments in a framework of computational dramaturgy, which is a part of drametrics and process philosophy in general:

1khem6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/4tran4/comments/1khem6i/personalitymaxxing_how_to_become_a_poonchad/,Personalitymaxxing: How to Become a Poonchad,"4t4 Jesus here

You are 5’1. You have a brutal WHR. You have Disney Princess face.

You might not pass as a cis male, but you can still become a poonchad by personalitymaxxing.

What is personalitymaxxing? Personalitymaxxing is accepting that you don’t look cis, but making up for your shortcomings in appearance by being extremely charming and fun to be around. Cis passing trans people still have it shit if they aren’t popular with cissoids but a clockable troon can win at life as long as they’re popular. 

I realized this when I met Sasha Colby the RPDR champion in person. She’s a gigaclock but she personalitymaxxed to the point where her aura is so strong that it doesn’t matter. You may be thinking that it’s different because she’s a trans woman and a drag queen but you would be wrong. Doods too can personalitymaxx.

The first step to personalitymaxxing is to touch grass. Go outside, go to a coffee shop, go to a library. At first you will be terrified but the more you do this the more you will become comfortable being in spaces with other people. Then, you can start trying to sit closer to people (i.e. if there is a group of armchairs around a table in a bookstore, sit in one of the chairs if someone else is there alone). Do this for a while until you feel comfortable. Then, start smiling and waving “hi” at the people you sit near. Sometimes they will strike up a conversation with you. You can increase your chances by wearing something interesting or reading a cool book. This method is the “practice range” for personalitymaxxing. 

You are most likely an autistic introvert with zero social skills but the more you speak to people the more you will develop the skills of being a charming and likeable person. If you are autistic, embrace being weird, because many people find autists with interesting hyperfixations very fun to listen to. Also, practice your smiling muscles. Don’t be creepy about it, but smiling while greeting people and laughing at their jokes will make people want to talk to you.

The most important thing to remember while in the personalitymaxxing practice range is that you will probably never see these people again so it’s fine to make mistakes. Be stupid, be awkward, say dumb shit because it won’t matter. Things you probably thought were irreparable mistakes before, people won’t notice. And if you do make an irreparable mistake, you will have learned for next time. 

If that’s the practice range for personalitymaxxing, the daily reps are complimenting people as you pass them. For poonchad purposes I would recommend coming up with a brand of compliments that makes people feel really good when they hear it. For example, I’m a fagmaxxer so I say horrendous shit like “shredded motherella on an eatzza” or “you didn’t just seven, you ate” to people if they have a good outfit or nice hair. But if you aren’t a faggot like me you can say “hey bro, looking good” or whatever straightoids say idk. Especially complimenting people who don’t look like they get it often, this will make you look like a complete gigachad. Also, be sure to be kind to children and animals, tip service workers well and help people when they need it (ie if they dropped something or it’s raining and they don’t have an umbrella). 

The best part about this brand of personalitymaxxing is that you don’t need to be an interesting or talented person, but you HAVE to have something to talk about. If the conversation is dead, start it. You can talk about the great book you just read or whatever autistic hobby you’re into right now. Ask people questions about themselves. Everyone is egotistical and likes to yap about themselves.

Finally, you have to be kind to others but you ALSO have to think you’re the shit. Wake up every morning and list off all the things you’re grateful for and all the ways you mog, even if there’s only a couple. In Spanish it’s called Mentalidad de abundancia or abundantly mentality. You need to make mogging goals that go past your appearance and fulfill them. I personally am academics maxxing but you can maxx all kinds of things, whether it’s a talent, a hobby, or even experiences that make you more interesting (like road trip maxxing). Walk with your head high and speak loudly and confidently. Dance to music playing in your earbuds when you’re in public. YGMI

“BUT POLLING IS INEFFICIENT,” you say, mouth foaming, sweat dripping onto your keyboard. Bro. Efficient for what? Your little LED blink project? Please. Just write a **tight super-loop**, slap a while(1) in there, and vibe.

Timers are a gateway drug to overengineering. They make you read manuals. They force you to **learn** things. And we all know learning is just a corporate scam to sell more dev kits.

So let’s go back to basics:

* One NE555.
* One potentiometer.
* One dream.

1kheh07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kheh07/is_it_worth_confessing_to_my_best_friend_that_i/,Is it worth confessing to my best friend that I have feelings for him?,"I (31F) have been close friends with a guy (29M) for the past 5 years. We met at a concert through mutual friends. In the early days of our friendship, he’d call me to talk on the phone. Something I found different in the digital age but enjoyed the effort he put into our friendship. Our conversations covered everything from philosophy and psychology to music and life. Over time, we built a strong connection and grew close through shared experiences: gaming, singing together, taking bachata classes, traveling, and exploring coffee shops.

In the beginning, I didn’t think of him romantically. We were both in other relationships, and the age difference made it easy to see him as just a friend. But as the years passed and our friendship deepened, I started to see how rare and special our bond was.

We’ve supported each other through breakups, and in some of my lowest moments, he’s comforted me without judgment. He knows parts of me even my childhood best friend doesn’t. Through him, I’ve met an amazing circle of friends that’s enriched my life. I’ve been single for over two years now, and he’s been single for about a year and a half. In that time, we’ve grown even closer, especially since we live in the same building. (To add some complicatation, his ex is my roommate but we’re cordial. On the other hand she hates his guts lol)

We spend late nights together. Talks and drinks. Or, I’d lay on his chest watching videos on his phone, sometimes we’d just lay on the couch and listen to music, or sing. Or platonically cuddle with nothing more.

One night, about 6 months ago, we shared a really intimate moment under the stars camping. We laced fingers, listened to music in a hammock, and reminisced about how we wouldn’t have met if it wasn’t through a mutual friend. He told me the world wouldn’t be as colorful without me in it. He kissed my forehead. I wasn’t sure what all that meant. 

One day, we fell asleep again cuddling. In a sober morning, we started hooking up. At first, it was a little awkward—distant, no kissing, mostly physical. But as time went on, it became more. Sometimes we kiss, sometimes we don’t. Sometimes he sends suggestive texts. 

The part that confused me was right when we hooked up he was open about dating other women, and I took that to mean we were just casual. Back then, I hadn’t caught feelings and it was nice to have a FWB situation with someone I knew. 

But my feelings have grown. We now sleep together almost weekly. While I know some people can separate sex from emotion, this doesn’t really seem casually like FWB but not quite situationship. 

Now he’s told me he’s moving to a new city in 6 months for work. 

I’ve been wondering whether I should tell him how I really feel. I don’t expect anything from him. I’m not looking to change what we have or convince him to stay. I just want him to know how deeply he’s impacted my life. Even if he ends up with someone else, I’d be genuinely happy for him.

But I don’t know how he’d react. Would it make things weird? We have a shared friend group, and he’ll likely come back to visit. I don’t want to lose what we have or make things awkward.

Still, part of me feels like saying something would be brave and honest because it’s nice to hear. The other part worries it’ll complicate everything.

Should I tell him how I feel?

1khegq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/school/comments/1khegq6/glad_i_graduated_before_one_of_my_favorite/,Glad I graduated before one of my favorite highschool events got ruined,"Every year in the spring my highschool held a charity event called THON where we would get the football field and track field to ourselves and could do whatever for a few hours. There were giant hamster balls, a coffee truck, all the food we wanted and a foam slide. There was also a community THON held earlier in the day for non high schoolers and people in the neighborhood. All the money from our tickets and outside donations went to children’s hospital and make a wish. We were always very successful and beat our previous record every year.

Well after I graduated I heard that this year they were deciding to ditch both THONs and replace it with a kickball tournament, still for charity. I was actually upset even though i didn’t go to that highschool anymore because it was so much fun the four years I went that freshmen didn’t even get to experience it this year. I saw the pictures and it was just a tiny event held in the high school parking lot. Kickball was on our baseball field while a couple tents from high school clubs lined up around the parking lot and it just looked sad and not half as fun as THON was. And I know we wouldn’t raise as much money for an event not even half the size as THON.

I heard the excuse was that it was hard to chaperone all the kids there as there were two fields right next to each other filled with high schoolers but I know the real reason was just a budget cut and they didn’t want to pay for it all. I would understand if it was an event that wasn’t really important but it was to the students and the charities we would donate to.",3,1746668393.0,school,0,1.0,False

Hot water heaters are notorious as they can easily consume 8 to 10 kWh/day for a single person living in an ordinary house.  I've found one though that is an unexpected load because of how it is used.  A coffee maker can consume an inordinate amount of electricity if it is used to make a couple of pots of coffee daily and is left plugged in to keep it warm.  Each pot of coffee runs about 1 to 1.5 kWh and keeping the pot warm usually is about 200 watts per hour.  If the pot is kept warm for 10 hours, it consumes 2 kWh just keeping warm.  Get a carafe and put the hot coffee in it.  It will stay warm for several hours without consuming electricity!

After tasting again we said it was sweet enough, but then my partners wife came in and said she thinks it needs to be even sweeter! I suspect she just has an extra sweet tooth but I am wondering if anyone has any thoughts on this. Their thought is that people who drink white mochas expect a super sweet drink and so they wont want to drink ours because its not sweet enough. I personally have hesitations because I am a bit more of a coffee purist than my partners, but I also understand that we want to sell to a wide range of people and we don't want to ostracize potential customers. Does anyone have any insight on this? Have you lost customers because your drinks are not ""sweet enough"" or does an upcharge of 25 cents for ""extra sweet"" work?

1.  First off and most glaring issue I discovered on disassembly that one of the brass pins on the dial had broken off (there was many witness marks so someone had been in here before and likely snapped it while removing the dial). Do you have any advice on how to reattach this or replace it? I know you can buy some basic pins online that allow you to replace them but I have exactly zero experience soldering and I wouldn't know where to start (nor do I have the tools).

2. The magic wheel gear that transfers the automatic rotor motion to the pawl system is rusted, how should I go about removing it without breaking the delicate post on the back? Any advice is appreciated.

3. The dial lume spots are half gone and the rest are way too old, do you all have any advice on where to get a solid lume set to replace these? I may do the coffee trick or something to darken the new lume and/or replace all the lume. I don't think this is early enough to be radium, but I'm still very nervous about scraping it off, if it is radium I won't mess with it and leave it as it is.

4. Is this movement truly only automatic wind? Like a modern 7s26? I got mixed info online and want to make sure I'm not missing parts.

 Thanks and I hope you guys are doing well, and i wish your small springs to ping off into view and not into the carpet.

Luci Forrester  
  
“I’m late, I’m late…” I mutter as I race through the corridors to get to class. Professor Elkins is not always forgiving, and if she makes me stand in front of the class to explain my tardiness, I won’t be able to stand it.  
  
I keep muttering to myself, and I hear the jingle start in my head. The white rabbit in the animated Alice in Wonderland. “I’m late, and I’m late for a very important date. No time to say hello goodbye, I’m late, I’m late, I’m…” I can see the entire movie playing before my eyes.  
  
“AHHH!” I let out an involuntary scream as I crash into a huge hard wall. I glance up and want to die. It’s not a wall I ran into, rather a concrete human body.  
  
My eyes are probably the size of saucers as I stare up into the face of one of the four kings of Kenton. The Reed “brothers” who rule the ice here at Kenton University and then the town along with their parents. I happened to run into the most ruthless one, Easton. He’s the hockey center and the most wanted bachelor probably among all the universities in this state. Which is code for entitled playboy in my book. The puck bunnies line up for him after every practice and game. He’s also the coldest and cruelest of the four.  
  
Great, just what I needed.  
  
My left pointer finger immediately begins scraping its nail along my thumb as I wait for him to explode. He’s not known for his pleasantness, and I pray he doesn’t remember me from the other two encounters we’ve had in the last two years. My thoughts roll around in my head as I shake it a little to focus. That damn white rabbit analogy distracted me.  
  
“I’m…sorry. I was chasing a rabbit.” I say with agitation, and he narrows his eyes at me. They are the most interesting color, like a silver with a hint of the palest ice blue throughout. That nonsense slipped out and I wince realizing he’ll think I’m clumsy and nuts. I concentrate hard to focus and get my thoughts in line. Come on brain!  
  
“Luci!” I hear my best friend cry out from down the hall.  
  
I peer around the massive hockey player and see Syd waving madly at me. The giant in front of me shifts to block my view shifting my attention back to him. Like I could forget he was here. They call him the Icebreaker because he basically mows down anything in his path to get to the goal.  
  
An angry frown appears on Easton’s face as I chance a look back up. “Is that your ‘rabbit’ you were chasing?”  
  
Oh god, his voice. I forgot how it affects you. It’s like the deepest, most gravelly sound I’ve ever heard. Not even in those online videos about the books I read do they sound like that. I can almost hear my eardrum tingling as it rolls through my head.  
  
“Ummm, no. I…”  
  
“Easton!!! Jackson!!!” A loud happy wail followed by a trill of laughter peals from behind me.  
  
I dare not turn to look, but see Jackson Reed’s blue eyes move from my face to the hall behind me. They narrow more and I wonder if he minds the attention. I had a class with him last year. He ignored me and every other girl in there. He’s almost as tall as his twin brother which is probably like jolly green giant height. I mean seriously, I could get a neck cramp staring up at these guys. Probably six-six or six-seven. They both have short ash blonde hair and while Easton’s is ruffled and messy, Jackson’s is styled smoother.  
  
Easton tilts his head slightly as his eyes don’t waver. “Shouldn’t you be running after your rabbit… Luci?”  
  
And now I know what an eargasm feels like when he says my name. What the hell is wrong with me today? This guy wants to kill me, I’m sure while I’m trying not to drool over his voice. And I shouldn’t, knowing he finds me as reprehensible as the rest of his team.  
  
I nod quickly and begin to step around him, but not before whispering. “Sorry.” Hopefully that doesn't revisit me later with some form of revenge.  
  
I walk fast, darting around the corner and peeking in the thin strip of glass to see Professor Elkins talking. Syd catches my attention and I see her hold up three fingers. I nod and wait to see her reach down before she throws something at the windows on the opposite wall.  
  
Professor Elkins turns to investigate the intrusion, and I slip in the door creeping to the first seat available. Syd gives me a thumbs up with a sneaky grin. Luckily, none of the football or hockey teams are in here or they would draw attention to our subterfuge to make me squirm.  
  
I pull out my notebook silently and begin taking notes of what she’s written on the board. This is one of my least favorite classes, but it’s mandatory for graduation. I do better with numbers than I do dry boring history. They just suit my scattered brain better.  
  
When I was ten, my teacher noticed I was always spaced out except during math class. She called my foster mom, Janet, and had a conference. After that, Janet took me to see a specialist. Mrs. Jenkins had suggested I was struggling with my focus so much and needed help. I was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD, a milder form of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Rather than have the hyperactive component, I was withdrawn and would daydream most of the day. Extremely unorganized and my brain rambles around with the weirdest pattern of thoughts. A lot like living in Wonderland with Alice sometimes.  
  
Janet was the nicest foster mom I had. I lived with her the longest too, for almost ten years. She took me to see a play therapist and other forms of interactive therapy where I learned some tricks to help me manage my situation.  
  
I met Sydney Olmos at an art therapy class when I was twelve. She was there waiting on her older brother, Banning, who has his own focus issues. She walked right over and introduced herself to me. Turns out we went to the same school and in the same grade, but I had never noticed her. She asked me three questions; my favorite color, favorite food and whether or not I thought Tommy Baldon in our class was cute. After she heard my answers, she declared we would be best friends from then on. And we were. I was surprised. She learned tricks to make sure I stayed focused around her and would defend me when I needed it. It helped that most didn’t pay that much attention to me when she was around. Still don’t to this day. It’s never bothered me.  
  
Syd always tells me I’m beautiful, but I’m not too concerned about my looks. One more thing I don't have time to worry about. I am what I am and if they only want to judge me on my looks, then so be it. Which is five seven with very little to brag about for my figure. My light brown hair and brown eyes are nothing special or unique. I have a small smattering of freckles across my nose and upper cheeks. No where else on my pale skin.  
  
Sydney's the typical American dream girl with blonde curly hair and dark blue eyes. Only an inch taller than me with a perfect figure and a year-round golden tan. All eyes are usually on her, which helps me a lot. Gives me time and space to organize my thoughts sometimes.  
  
Class ends and Syd comes to wait for me.  
  
“That was close.” She says with a big smile, and I laugh.  
  
“Thanks, Syd. I hit an icy impasse.” She tugs my arm and puts her finger to her lips until we hit the hallway.  
  
“Did he do anything to you?” She whispers worriedly.  
  
“No, I think one of the puck bunnies showed up, so he was more concerned with that. Let me go with a little taunt, and that’s it.” I shrug, and we move cautiously around the corner. Thankfully, it's mostly empty.  
  
""So he didn't remember you from last year?"" She asks as we head toward her car.  
  
""Didn't seem to."" I say as I climb in.  
  
Last year, I'd been in the middle of heading to a table in the student center with my lunch. Naturally, I'd been lost in my head trying to organize my assignments for the day. Wasn't paying attention which was completely my fault.  
  
Jim, one of the football players had tripped me. I went flying as did my tray of food. While the fries and nuggets weren't a problem, the open yogurt cup was. Strawberry yogurt flew out and pelted none other than the quarterback of the football team, Julian. He'd snarled and gotten up shouting obscenities at me. In revenge, he grabbed his water bottle and dumped it on me. My shirt was completely soaked, and of course, it was mostly white, so it became transparent. I'd hunched into myself as they all laughed. It mostly cleared out after that. I sat there until the football team left.  
  
A pair of extremely large feet had come to stand right in front of me. When I dared to look up, I stared into those narrowed angry eyes I admired earlier today. That was the first time I heard his voice. He had blotches of strawberry yogurt on his jeans, and I gasped.  
  
""I... I didn't..."" Before I could finish, he had growled. Full on growled like some kind of angry wolf.  
  
""You f\*\*\*\*\*g did! Here, it's already ruined by you anyway. You should cover yourself!"" He said angrily as I stared at the floor both humiliated and furious. I glanced up to see him reach behind his neck with one hand and pull the black hoodie he wore off in one swift, easy movement. He dumped it on my head and strode off. I'd tugged it on, grateful for it while wanting to burn it. All day long, I tried to ignore the scent of it.  
  
Sydney teased me about it, but stopped when I told her the whole story.  
  
""Burn it when you get home. But it's useful for now, babe.""  
  
Syd's voice then echoes as she calls me softly. ""Luci… Luci… tune back in, babe.""  
  
I shake my head. ""Sorry, Syd. Are we going to pick up Barrett? I can watch him while you go to the lab tonight.""  
  
""I appreciate it. We're going to make it, Luci. Last year of school.""  
  
I stem the hopeful joy and answer practically. “Only 155 school days left until graduation. Now to survive the final year of hell.”  
  


# Chapter 2: Timing

Luci  
  
I’ve always had horrible timing. Not just with my focus and disorganization issues, but like the universe arranging events in my life. I woke up late this morning after setting my alarm wrong. The coffee shop we stop at for breakfast some mornings was packed which set me back an extra ten minutes.  
  
I am a glutton for routine. Partly because it helps me stay on track and also because boring is comforting. Growing up in foster care, you had to worry about being moved around suddenly. Until I moved in with Janet when I was eight, I moved at least three or four times a year. So doing the same old thing every day works for me just fine.  
  
I'm letting the song lyrics roll through my head as I desperately try to remember the name of the actual song. I should just look it up, but I can only catch one word out of ten each time I hear it. It takes me a minute to realize the girl behind the counter is calling to me.  
  
""Oh, sorry. I'd like a Chai latte and a blueberry muffin.""  
  
""Sorry, we just sold the last blueberry muffin to the guy in front of you. How about something else?""  
  
More proof my timing sucks. Great!  
  
I hurry to look into the case. I was really craving a blueberry muffin. One with plump juicy berries and extra streusel topping…  
  
FOCUS LUCI! I shout at myself.  
  
""Umm, how about a cheese danish then.""  
  
""And we're out of Chai to make the lattes.""  
  
Double great.  
  
""Just a regular vanilla latte then."" I say with disappointment.  
  
I walk back to my car nibbling on the danish I didn't want and sip my coffee. It's more acceptable than the danish. That stupid song tune begins dancing in my head again.  
  
After my first class, I call my boss and see if anyone has inquired about me working for them. Mrs. Simpson sighs and tells me it's been very slow lately, but she’s hopeful something will turn up soon.  
  
I hang up with her. I can wait a few more weeks before I really need to be working. I have enough saved to survive easily for another two months. But I don't like to leave that up to chance or get too close to being broke. Unlike a lot of my peers here, I have no one to fall back on if that happens.  
  
I walk into my third class of the day and slither to a halt right inside the door. Usually I get to this class early enough I can get to the seats in the back. But somehow the two football players and the hockey team have shown up way early today.  
  
I take a quick breath and focus on moving to the steps on the side. With luck, I'll walk right past them. But as I pass the second row, I feel the tug on my backpack and barely manage to stay upright.  
  
""It's the curse. Did you guys know she was in here? Maybe we should tell the professor we won't sit in class with such bad luck.""  
  
I glare at Deacon White, the wide receiver for the football team. He loves to verbally tease me. Julian, the quarterback is here too. He glares at me with hatred. He thinks he has reason.  
  
I stand still and stare at a spot on the wall before me. Class will start soon enough and they’ll release me. I used to pop off with snide rejoinders but it had no effect and seemed to put a bigger target on my back. My silence has honestly allowed them to mostly ignore me unless they are bored.  
  
""Hey Reed, you seen the curse in here before?"" Deacon taunts. In my periphery I spot the four kings.  
  
""I don't look for mice usually."" One of the other hockey team members, Maxton Porter calls out mockingly. ""She could be fun to hunt though. You'd like that wouldn't you little mouse? If we hunted you. Not that the catch would be anything you enjoyed. We could exorcise the curse finally.""  
  
I stepped on his foot a few weeks ago and made him spill his drink on himself. He was flirting with two girls who laughed at him and took off. Since then, he’s been especially hateful.  
  
I see even Deacon raise an eyebrow to that. That sounds dark and disgusting. Kind of like a walking sewer trap that guy. Before I can stop it, my brain is swirling around seeing some tall green goo covered guy that smells like rotting eggs chasing me like in the old Scooby Doo cartoons Barrett watches some afternoons.  
  
""Hey, don't ignore me, you filthy little b\*\*\*h! You should be glad I even noticed you."" A vice-like grip descends on my wrist and my neck. I yelp in pain and fall, but the grip doesn't lessen. Deacon is on his feet.  
  
""I didn't mean for you to touch her man!""  
  
Maxton is staring down at me, his eyes blazing. Suddenly, another hand clamps down on the one holding my wrist. It swallows his and even wraps around my hand a little.  
  
""Release her now! You took it too far, Maxton."" Becker Reed's angry voice permeates my fear. ""Coach will have your ass if she presses charges.""  
  
""Be ready, little mouse. Your time is coming. Press charges, and I'll make sure you really don't enjoy it."" He snarls as he stomps away.  
  
Becker holds his hand out to help me up, but I shy away before using the wall to stand up. I'm going to have a set of bruises on my wrist and neck.  
  
""Does your wrist feel broken?"" He asks quietly.  
  
""Would it matter?""  
  
I stomp up the stairs to my seat away from them, refusing to cry. I hate this school and the athletic departments. The football and hockey coaches are brothers. Nothing would happen if I complained. They rule the school and then the Reed family rules the city. If I didn't have a full scholarship here, I'd leave in a heartbeat.  
  
Julian scoffs. ""I think I'll bounce today. Will tell Coach Humphries she's in this class when I go hit the gym.” He raises his eyebrows at me as he smirks.  
  
I slump down in my seat and make it through class, hardly daydreaming because I'm so angry. My wrist is throbbing too. I need to ice it. I let them leave first, not even moving for almost five minutes after they walk. I do see Becker stare up at me for a few seconds. He's probably worried I'll call campus security and have his teammate benched.  
  
I walk into my next class and take a seat. Before it begins, I see one of the campus clinic nurses walk in. She looks around and then points to me. ""Luci Forrester?""  
  
I nod. She hands me an ice pack that can be velcroed around my wrist. ""I was told to deliver that by the hockey coach.""  
  
I take it wishing I could throw it in Maxton's face instead.  
  
""Thank you."" She smiles and walks away.  
  
I leave my last class and decide I will stop and get an iced coffee as a treat for this awful day. I'm almost to the coffee shop when I hear a car going way too fast for this curvy one-lane campus road. I see a young blonde boy stepping off the sidewalk to cross the street. The car isn’t slowing down and I spot why. The driver is holding his phone up at eye level. That boy will be crushed.  
  
""LOOK OUT!"" I scream and my feet move of their own volition. I make it to him in time to grab him and throw us both to the ground. I managed to land with him mostly on top of me to avoid scraping him up. Ignoring the pain from sliding across the concrete, I hurry to wrap him up with as much of my body as I can.  
  
The car clips two others racing straight through the spot the little boy was frozen in. He hits a tree not far from us, and I hear other people screaming.  
  
One lady comes up and helps me to my feet. ""I saw the whole thing. It's a good thing you were paying attention at that very minute.""  
  
More like a miracle I wasn't chasing a heffalump or something similar with my scatterbrain I think. I don't express that.  
  
I crouch down, holding my hand out to him. ""Hey. My name's Luci. Can you move your arms and legs, sweetie?""  
  
He nods with tears in his eyes. ""Do you hurt anywhere?""  
  
""My knee."" I glance at it to see the slight scrape.  
  
""We'll get that all taken care of once the ambulance arrives. What's your name?"" A small crowd has formed, but I ignore them and focus on him.  
  
""Co...Cole."" He stammers out. His teeth are chattering, and I realize he could be going into shock from the scare. I struggle to focus and remember he needs to stay warm. Quickly, I tug the hoodie over my head and slip it on him.  
  
""Here sweetie, we need to keep you warm. Talk to me ok. What were you doing out here by yourself?""  
  
""My nanny left me. She's mean and she wanted coffee. I didn't want to go. She was mad mad and went inside. I was sposed to wait over there. But the wind took my paper. I chased it.”  
  
My anger spikes at that.  
  
""Cole, how old are you?"" The woman who helped me stands listening. I think she's recording it with her phone, but I don't really care.  
  
""Four.""  
  
Fucking i\*\*\*t is my first thought along with needing to take a pair of pliers and a blowtorch to her sorry ass. She left a four year old by himself.  
  
""Do you know her name?""  
  
He nods slowly. ""Madison.""  
  
The woman next to me scoffs. ""She'll show up and be all concerned in a minute. You mark my words.""  
  
Before she could though, an ambulance's sirens make their presence known.  
  
""Cole, the ambulance is coming. We'll see about calling your parents. Can you...""  
  
""OH MY GOD! COLE? COLE?"" A tall redhead comes running in, screaming her head off.  
  
The woman next to me mutters, ""Well, she makes quite an entrance."" She clears her throat. ""Are you the infamous Madison who abandoned your ward?""  
  
""Shut up lady! COLE!"" She runs toward the car. I glance down at Cole who is trying to hide his face in my hoodie. I smile at him.  
  
""It's ok sweetie. You can hide in there. I won't tell her where you are until we get you near the ambulance.""  
  
Two of them park along with a fire truck and a few police cars. The lady with me is very helpful. She asks me for my name and number. I rattle it off watching Cole the entire time. She texts me something.  
  
""I am Mary. I sent you my name and the video."" Mary begins waving the paramedics our way.  
  
""Was someone hurt here?""  
  
""This brave young woman pulled that little boy out of the path of the car. They landed hard on the sidewalk. Might need to be checked over."" I appreciate her taking charge.  
  
""Miss, is he your son?""  
  
""No, this is Cole. We just met."" I smile at him, and he pokes his head out of the hoodie.  
  
""Hi Cole, I'm Warner. Did you get hurt?"" He crouches down beside me.  
  
""My knee burns. My shoulder hurts."" He says in a small voice.  
  
""I tried to let him land on top of me. He may have bumped his shoulder."" I say with regret.  
  
""You did more than enough getting him out of the road, Miss...""  
  
""Luci, Luci Forrester.""  
  
""Miss Forrester. Cole, can we put you on the stretcher in the ambulance to take you to the hospital? We'll bandage your knee first.""  
  
He shies away and stares at me. ""Can Luci come with me?""  
  
Warner stares at me. ""Sure I can. Come on sweetie. I'll carry you."" I lift him up, and that horrid screaming starts again.  
  
""OH COLE! THANK GOD YOU'RE OK!"" A blur of red hair moves in next to us and she yanks on Cole trying to take him from me.  
  
He grips my neck tight, crying. ""NO! NO! WANT LUCI! NO!""  
  
""COLE! Don't be silly. Come to Madison."" She tugs on him again almost pulling us down.  
  
Warner touches her arm at that. ""Miss, you'll need to let him go. He doesn't want to go with you. Who are you?""  
  
Two police officers have now come to our side.  
  
""I'm his nanny. He's being ridiculous."" She scoffs.  
  
""Cole, I'm Officer Perkins. Is she your nanny?"" His voice is gentle and calm.  
  
""Yes, but she left me!"" He sobs into my neck, and I sway him back and forth.  
  
""Could we put him in the ambulance so they can bandage his knee and then answer questions?"" I ask softly.  
  
They all agree except Madison. Mary shows the officers the video while we get Cole bandaged up. Officer Perkins comes back over.  
  
""Ok, Cole. You don't have to go with Madison to the hospital. We'll get her to call your family so they can be there."" He throws Madison a dirty look.  
  
""And Luci can come with me?"" He asks in that small voice.  
  
""She can if she has time."" I nod at the officer.  
  
""Great. I'll meet you there. Good thing you were here when it happened, Luci.""  
  
I silently agree. Maybe my timing is looking better after all to some people.",1,1746668033.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I (28m) met a girl (27f) on a dating app over a month ago. We pretty much spoke a few messages everyday getting to know each other (but not overdoing it). I asked if she'd like to meet and chat over coffee. We finally met last weekend over a coffee and walk around the city, it was fantastic - we didn't stop talking the whole time - in fact, I was that one that reminded her that she needed to be somewhere soon. We had a quick hug at the end and I mentioned that I'd like to see her again, but there's no pressure.

A few hours later she messaged me saying she had such a nice time and it was great to finally meet me, but nothing about setting up another date. I responded back with a similar message. Over the next few days, the conversation continued daily over a few texts a day. Yesterday I asked her if she'd like to attend an event with me next week, to which she responded saying she's actually travelling next week (which is cool of course), but again, she didn't suggest an alternative, like meeting before that.

This has thrown me off quite a bit because I feel like if someone is interested, they'd offer an alternative plan, like ""Let's have lunch/dinner before I leave to travel"". It's not like she's ghosting/distancing herself either - we still send a few messages daily about random stuff. She even mentioned that she'll let me know how her trip goes. I feel like if I ask again, I'll be coming off as too deperate.

At this point, I'm still hopeful. But I think I've become too invested in her, like I've put all my eggs in 1 basket. So I've sort of partially disengaged and have started talking to other matches.

I also have an inexpensive 0.1g coffee scale that I've been using to weight my beans before grinding.

I know that I would like a bottomless portafilter as it will be helpful in dialing in, and from the YouTube reviews, the tamper the Turin ships with is crappy, so I'd like some recommendations for those.  I would also like a 22g basket so I can make larger shots.  Beyond that, however I don't know what other things I should pick up.

 I'm 5'9 ('10 on a good day lol) and fit. I've been working on my fitness goals for a few years now and currently training for a half marathon. I have glasses and short hair that curls when it gets longer. Being active is important to me.

I'm a pretty big nerd, but in like a cool way? At least I'd like to think so. I built my own PC, I like playing Magic the Gathering with friends, and love watching anime. I'm trying to get into reading but I might need some help with that.

I graduated college and now work a decent enough paying job for a bigger company. It's not glorious but it does pay bills.

I'm looking for girls 20-25 that are responsible (mostly), healthy, and understanding. I think the biggest thing I'm looking for is self improvement.

Thanks for reading this far. Some bonus things I like are black coffee, plants, and golf. If you're interested in testing the waters please give me a shout. I'm fairly active on reddit and don't mind exchanging numbers.

""About six months ago, I met Sofia on Seeking. I was just coming out of a situationship and had a few prior experiences with sugar arrangements while traveling. I was 32, she was 27, and we met in a major metropolitan city. Over drinks at a bar, we hit it off—great conversation, natural chemistry. Not long after, she proposed a PPM arrangement, and we began what would become a steady sugar relationship.

From the start, the physical chemistry was undeniable. We’d go 2–4 rounds a night depending on the mood, and both of our needs were more than met. To be honest, the PPM she requested felt modest given the dynamic. We met about once a week, kept things simple—no drama, no alcohol, just great sex. Occasionally, she’d ask for an advance: once when she traveled abroad, once when I had to cancel. I always obliged.

Our time together was fun and easy. She'd come over, we'd hook up, laugh, and unwind. Over time, I learned bits about her culture. I especially appreciated when she introduced me to a foreign film from her country—it was a small gesture, but it stuck with me.

Things began to shift slightly. Before the holidays, she slept over for the first time as a kind of “special occasion.” In January, we went to a concert together—she even met some of my friends. She surprised me by showing up to cheer at the finish line when I ran a half marathon. Then came Valentine’s Day. We spent it together, and she casually mentioned she didn’t see us ending up together. I told her I hadn’t ruled anything out, and that maybe we could explore a real relationship. Through some miscommunication, she thought we *were* now boyfriend and girlfriend, and added me on social media for the first time. At the end of the night, I clarified the misunderstanding—she stormed out and unfriended me.

I texted her, apologized, and said we were still just getting to know each other. Surprisingly, that didn’t end things. Our arrangement continued, but with more variety—we started doing non-sexual things like beach days, park strolls, even a dance social. She helped me pack the day before a big trip to Argentina. If we didn’t hook up, she never asked for anything. We binged *White Lotus* together, and during that time, she brought a surprising sense of calm into my life.

While I was in Argentina (about six weeks ago), I realized I had real feelings for her—this wasn’t just a casual hookup anymore. When I got back, she was dealing with a visa issue in Mexico. Before she left, we watched the *White Lotus*finale together and talked seriously. I told her what I had been thinking during my trip—that I wanted to explore something real with her. She said she’d want to spend more time together too, but still needed financial support. I asked if getting a two-bedroom condo and having her move in would be enough support. She said yes.

The night before she left, she invited me to her place to say goodbye. For the first time, we hooked up at *her* apartment—and I didn’t pay her. It felt... different. We made plans for me to visit her in Mexico, and a few weeks later, I did. We explored Monterrey together. I paid for the hotel and meals, but she covered her own travel from Mexico City. We had a lot of sex but didn’t talk about the relationship dynamic. It was fun, but a bit unspoken.

Ten days after she returned to my country, she texted me saying she was back and excited to see me. Then came the request—she had overspent and needed an advance. I said I was excited to see her too, but wanted things to feel real, not transactional. She agreed in principle, said she wanted that too and hoped we could talk... but circled back to the money.

That’s when I realized I had to step back. I told her I was looking for something real, and that it didn't seem like we were on the same page, and that I was open to hearing her out if I misunderstood. She wished me the best and deleted my contact. A few days later, I reached out to see if she wanted to meet for coffee. She politely declined. I assume she already lined up someone new.

Looking back, I genuinely enjoyed my time with her. I miss her. It’s jarring how quickly the mask came off, though. Part of me wishes we had just kept it simple—hookup buddies with no confusion. But maybe that would have just delayed the inevitable while I stayed stuck, still without a real girlfriend.

One lesson stands out: never propose going vanilla with a sugar baby unless you’re ready to lose *everything* that made the arrangement work.""

Anyway ... after a week of reflection/breakdown in the relationship. I want her back in my life (go figure) - although she seems to have pulled away. I offered to just talk to her and pay her a PPM for that and didn't receive a response. I think I have one last ditch attempt in me - offering an a clear arrangement with more stability and income and apologizing for poor communication and potential hurt. This is definitely my last move. Given the dynamics in this city, I am skeptical she has found someone for more than a PPM at this point, but definitely possible.

 Is this the best way to proceed? Should I delay reaching out since she has not been responsive?",3,1746667151.0,sugarlifestyleforum,5,0.81,False
1khe1u6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1khe1u6/congressman_kileys_office_is_actively_avoiding/,Congressman Kiley's Office is Actively Avoiding Our Small Business Pleas For Tariff Relief.,"Feeling hopeless and upset after my latest attempt to schedule a meeting with my Congressman's office today.

Today, as a member of my local Chamber of Commerce, I attended our local 'Government Relations Meeting'. A forum our Congressman's District Representative normally attends and provides updates and fields questions. District Representative, Jack Thompson, had previously hung up on our first scheduled phone meeting, and I've not received any response to my questions submitted weeks ago.

Yesterday I reached the office of the Congressman's Legislative Director, James Zandstra, who claimed to not be able to confirm the Congressman's stance on U.S. tariffs nor could he confirm if any reversal/relief should be expected. And when pressed that our business is facing dire uncertainty amongst our projects and staff...he hung up.

(TLDR: With our U.S. business at a complete standstill due to inability to import at 145% tariffs - we're in desperate need of guidance from our Congressman about what to expect moving forward on trade.)

The response today was disheartening, insensitive, and left me feeling even less hopeful. It is paraphrased below:

1. Congressman Kiley's Director of Operations & Scheduling emailed me this morning, with Jack Thompson CC'd, stating he was the person I'm supposed to schedule meetings with.
2. After his presentation and plugging that the office is there to help with any federal policy matters we have as Chamber members, District Rep Jack Thompson attempted to avoid my public question leaving the podium after making eye contact. I was the sole question in the room and directly in front of him.
3. When brought to his attention by those in attendance, he yielded to my question and publicly committed to scheduling a meeting with me today.
4. In private, the District Representative told me he had neither his calendar or phone on him and was not in a position to schedule a future meeting.
5. Congressman Kiley's District Rep said I could not stop by the office and schedule with him later today as he has other obligations to attend to.
6. He made a joke about financial bribery in an alleged attempt to bring ""levity"" in my desperation and offer to meet locally, in DC, over coffee or lunch, etc.
7. He refused to take copies of our products to the Congressman's office as examples of goods we are producing internationally. I'd brough several to lend as examples.
8. After many attempts to insist he had my info and would contact me eventually, he finally committed to CALLING me by end of Friday to SCHEDULE a FUTURE meeting.

UPDATE: In the midst of writing this post (and after sharing this encounter across social media elsewhere), I've just received an email from Jack Thompson offering a meeting with himself here locally on May 22nd, a month after our first phone meeting in which I was hung up on, and still have not received answers.

I have replied in good faith and hope to get some clarity on what to expect from this meeting, and will provide updates as I receive them. My expectations are sadly incredibly low based on our interaction today.

\----------------------------

My previously submitted, and still unanswered, questions for the Congressman's office:

1. Has Congressman Kiley received my messages, or listened to my story, and if so what is his response?
2. Does congressman Kiley understand the damage that U.S. tariffs impose on U.S. small businesses?
3. Does Congressman Kiley support the volatility we've seen with trade, and the 145% import tariffs on U.S. small businesses who manufacture with China?
4. Does Congressman Kiley feel he has any responsibility to rein in President Trump on U.S. volatile trade policy?
5. What advice does Congressman Kiley have for our small business, currently sitting on \~$1.2M in products already produced in China?
6. Our products can't currently be made in the USA. What actions is Kevin Kiley taking to invest federal funding into domestic manufacturing?
7. Can I receive a call, or set up a meeting with, the Congressman?

plus he was so chaotic as well and i remember he was complaining about living in her house and working in a coffee shop. 
“living in a god damn slum” 

i did want them to be end game but then again i also wanted fiona and mike to be endgame too. i guess it’s good fiona learned to be alone when she left. for the most part i did like jimmy though except when he was dating estefania or whatever 🙁🙁🙁💔💔💔 ESTEFANIA WAS GORGEOUS THOUGH😜🦋🦋",1,1746667033.0,shameless,2,1.0,False

I dress up super professional for work, hair slicked back, glasses, button up shirt, you know the whole deal. girl randomly texts me tonight asking for a favor, too expensive for an uber, was wondering if I could pick her up. Here is the thing, i only ever drive to work in my corolla. I also have a jag ftype. I saw the fucking opportunity and i took it. went to pick her up, told her i was pulling up and honked at her, clearly she didn’t expect to see me pull up in this, I have a few tats but always hide them with my button ups, she notices, we have a really good conversation and now we are going to get coffee this weekend. god im so fucking hyped. legit it’s the coolest thing that has happened to me in YEARS. I really needed this. It’s been such a shitty week so far, i’m so glad this happened.

tldr: i lived out my younger college fantasy of picking up a girl with a cool car and the hidden dark side aesthetic ",18,1746666871.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False
1khdvg7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1khdvg7,Review: Van Leeuwens coffee affogato,"I really enjoy a good affogato, and a good coffee ice cream, so when I saw this flavor I grabbed it. Van Leeuwens describes this flavor as sweet cream ice cream and coffee ice cream swirled together. 

I could taste a distinct difference between the sweet cream part of the swirl and the coffee part, which was nice. The sweet cream was smooth, creamy, and rich but remained subtle. The coffee swirl had a notable coffee taste, but it was also very creamy. This was a little confusing to me, because affogatos combine a potent, dark espresso shot with ice cream. They're not throwing a scoop of ice cream into a latte that's already pumped with sugar and milk, which is kind of what this tasted like.

This ice cream wasn't bad, but there's definitely other brands of coffee ice cream I would choose over this. I know ice cream is made of mostly cream, but the coffee flavor was a little too diluted for my taste. It reminded me of a latte with extra extra milk instead of an affogato. I will say if you like a more faint coffee taste- this flavor could be perfect for you. ",17,1746666587.0,icecream,5,1.0,False
1khdtpd,https://i.redd.it/us68u312kgze1.jpeg,That‘s the way to go,"After my recent experience with KLM which you can read here https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/s/PHYi7pFgtw I was facing a similar situation:

My inbound was delayed so the minimum connection time was no longer doable with my connection. 

KLM rebooked me automatically to the flight next day. I made it to the gate with ease before they closed boarding but since I had been rebooked, they did not allow me to board. Arrived 3 hours later with a lot of stress. 

Today, my LH flight was a little late, undercutting the 1:20 Minimum connection time in ORD. 

United protected me on a flight the next day (the earliest alternative) but did not offload me from my original flight. I made it from the aircraft door in T5, thru immigration, clearing customs (which took 5 min, carry on only), to T1 by train and thru TSA into the lounge within 23 mins (without running at all). I got GE and precheck but the normal lines weren‘t long either. 

I boarded my flight and even had time for a bite and coffee in the UA club. 

If I would have missed the flight, I would have had a seat. But I made it and could board with ease. That‘s how to do it, and I love how UA handles (potential) irregs. ",10,1746666438.0,unitedairlines,0,1.0,False
