I live in a so-called ""luxury"" building, which basically is a property management company managed apartment complex with on-site maintenance, some basic amenities (gym, free coffee, a community room, etc.). In January of this year, my building's elevator stopped working and it has been down ever since. The leasing office at first sent a few emails notifying tenants that the elevator was ""temporarily out of order"". But later on in April, after multiple requests from tenants, they emailed tenants saying that the elevator cannot be repaired and therefore needs to be completely removed and a new one has to be installed. In May they gave an ETA of end of August for the new elevator to be up and running. 

My building have several wings. The wing that I live in has 6 floors with the laundry room on the basement floor. There's a working elevator located in the adjacent wing, but that elevator only goes to floor 1-4, and it can't reach the basement laundry room. In April, the leasing office bought 1 camping wagon cart thing and put it in the community room and said tenants can use that to transport stuff to their floors. 

I want to know if as a tenant I can sue my building and ask for a certain percentage of my rent to be returned? Many of my fellow tenants have also expressed their frustration with the property management company and this entire elevator repair nonsense. Not once had the leasing office mentioned any monetary compensation to all the units/tenants affected. 

Thanks in advance for any advice given! ",1,1751858336.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

Genre: Romantic Drama / Adventure

Tone: Sultry, heartfelt, with a mix of playful chemistry and intense emotional stakes

Setting: A blend of a charming small town and glamorous locales (private villas, coastal estates, city penthouses)

Core Conflict: Her untamed spirit clashes with his controlled, high-stakes world, their electric connection threatening to upend their lives.

Characters

•  Jasper Kane: 28, a billionaire tech visionary, 6’2” with a commanding presence and sharp, dark eyes. His polished charm hides a disciplined intensity, honed by years of running an empire. Beneath his confident exterior, he’s lonely, craving a connection that challenges his carefully curated life.

•  Lila Monroe: Early 20s, a vibrant, quick-witted woman with a magnetic spark. Her background and inner struggles are yours to shape, maybe a small town dreamer, a city girl with hidden depths, or something unique. Lila’s bold energy and restless spirit draw people in, but there’s a fire in her that’s waiting for the right moment to blaze.

Plot Outline

Act 1: The Spark
Jasper, escaping his high pressure world, lands in a quaint small town, maybe a coastal village or a Midwest haven. Lila’s working at a cozy spot, like a bookstore or café, her warmth and sharp humor catching his eye. Their meeting is electric: a spilled coffee, a lingering glance, or a rainy day that pulls them together. Over dinner at a local diner, Lila’s fearless wit unsettles Jasper’s usual control. A fleeting touch, like her hand brushing his, ignites something undeniable. When she invites him in after a drive home, their first kiss is a spark that promises a wildfire, leaving Jasper hooked and Lila shaken by her own intensity.

Act 2: The Flame

Jasper invites Lila to his world, a weekend at a stunning villa in Santorini or a sleek city penthouse (your choice). Lila, torn between her roots and this new adventure, says yes. Their chemistry deepens in lush settings: a candlelit dinner by the sea, a dance under city lights, or a quiet moment in a sprawling estate. Lila’s vibrant energy pushes Jasper to let go, while he shows her a world of possibility. Between stolen glances and heartfelt talks, they share vulnerabilities, her fears of losing herself, his struggle with isolation. Their connection grows, but so does the tension of their different worlds.

Act 3: The Reckoning

Back in Jasper’s fast paced life (New York, London, or your pick), their bond strains under external pressures. Lila’s fearless spirit feels like too much for his structured world; Jasper’s empire demands focus, and doubts creep in. A heated argument sends Lila running, scared she’s disrupted his life. Jasper chases her, maybe to her hometown or a quiet retreat, confessing she’s awakened something real in him. They reconcile in a simple setting, a cabin, her old apartment, finding balance between passion and stability. Their story ends with a playful, hopeful moment, building a life that blends their worlds.

About Me

Hey, I’m the writer behind Jasper, excited to craft a story that’s equal parts heart-pounding and heartfelt. I love vivid, sensory details, think warm summer breezes or the hum of a bustling city, that make every scene pop. My style mixes sharp banter, emotional depth, and chemistry that crackles. I’ll play Jasper as a charismatic, driven man who’s unraveling for the right person. I’m thrilled for you to shape Lila, her past, her dreams, her fire, while keeping her bold and vibrant. Let’s create a rollercoaster of romance and drama, with characters who challenge and complete each other. I prefer plotting via private messages here first, then moving to another platform for writing if we click. Drop me a chat or DM to start building this world together!

1ltjq40,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ltjq40/all_the_way_to_nineveh_part_16/,All the Way to Nineveh (Part 1/6),"     When you shoot up heroin, you lay on your side, never your back. This way, if you vomit in your sleep, you won't choke.
     My mother graduated rehab when I was five. She gained custody of me a year later. My dad didn't fight her in court, and I was glad. I didn't hate my father. He wasn't abusive or anything like that, we just never really got along the way most sons and fathers do. It seemed like he was always somewhere else. His life was a simple routine. Go to work, come home, cook dinner for us, then take his plate and bottle of budweiser to his room and to watch TV.
     My mom, despite her addiction, was different. I was the center of her world, and she always made sure I knew. So when my dad told me I'd be moving back in with her, I was thrilled.
     We had a small, two bedroom apartment in New Jersey. The routine was different there. Each morning, my mom would wake me up and make breakfast. She'd drive me to school on her way to work, which was a nice change as I no longer had to take the bus. 
     A couple months after she got me back, she bought a rabbit. Apparently, she'd seen a bunch of videos of bunnies and started to obsess over it. Looking back, it makes sense. When an addict quits heroin, it becomes much harder for the brain to produce serotonin naturally. Having something cute to take care of filled that gap. At least for a little while. 
     She named the rabbit Virgil.
     My mom was glued to that rabbit. She never kept him in a cage unless she was at work. Whenever we took road trips, we'd take him with. Whenever we'd eat dinner, she'd leave a plate of lettuce under the table so we could all eat together. For all intents and purposes, he was a member of our family.
     She stayed clean for another year. Then she met Mark.
     Mark was a waiter at the restaurant my mom worked at. He seemed alright at first. He never gave me a reason to dislike him, but he never really gave me a reason to like him either. He mostly ignored me whenever he came over, just hung out with my mom and watched TV. It wasn't long before he moved in with us. 
     Mark would fall asleep a lot, often in the middle of conversations. Sometimes he'd nod out while standing up. It was weird, but I was 6 so I didn't think too much about it. At least until my mom started doing it too. 
     The routine changed again. Soon, I was getting up alone in the mornings and taking the bus, like before. Mom would forget to feed Virgil a lot, so I became his sole caretaker, leaving him a plate of lettuce in the mornings before school and a plate at night. Sometimes I'd find burnt spoons in her room. Sometimes there'd be something blue in it. It was a pretty blue, like the blue markings on the backs of those poisonous frogs they find in the rainforest. Like the blue face of an asphyxiated body. 
      She'd didn't talk a lot in those last couple months. The silence was strange for a house that used to be full of her laughter. It was stranger when she did talk.
      She'd say my name sometimes, but she'd be looking in the other direction, staring into space. “Jonah,” she'd say. “You made it. I missed you so much.” 
      “Virgil's going down,” I remember her saying once. She was standing in the kitchen, stirring an empty pot she'd forgotten to put water in. “Down, down, down. All the way to Ninevah.” She smiled and turned to me, her eyes barely open. “We're gonna meet him there. Just you and me kid. You and me against the world.”
     After a couple months of this, Mark suddenly disappeared. Apparently, the cash my mom pulled out for rent at the end of the month disappeared too. My mom lost her shit.
     My mom walked through the kitchen and everything in her path was broken to pieces. Glasses and plates were shattered against the wall, pots thrown to the floor. She only stopped when I started to cry.
     In an instant the rage was gone and she was swooping her arms around me and holding me. Sweat and tears poured down her face as I sobbed into her shoulder. We stayed like that for a while, her saying “sorry” after “sorry” and me saying “it's okay” and her saying “it's not okay, I'm sorry” again.
     “We're gonna be alright,” she said as Virgil hopped around the broken shards of glass in the kitchen. “You and me against the world, kid.”
     She cleaned up the mess and we went back to the routine. 

     A week later I woke up to her standing in the doorway of my bedroom. All the lights were out in the house, aside from my night light- a little globe with a lens that projected an array of constellations onto the wall. I don't know how long she had been standing there, or how long she'd been talking, but I remember the way she looked, her eyes drifting into space.
     “Then you should go,” she said as Orion's Belt drifted across her face, stained blue by the light. His arrow pointed to the right wall of the room. “Go, love.”
     “Mom?” I said.
     Her eyes drifted down to me, and she smiled.
     “It always ends right here,” she said. “Then it starts all over again. All over again. It's a skipping record.” Her eyes watered. “I'm so happy it ends here…here….with you.”
     She took a seat on the end of my bed.
     “It starts with you and it ends with you.”
     She was silent for a while, staring at me and smiling. Eventually, she wiped her tears and stood up, leaning down to kiss my forehead.
     “Goodnight love, I'll see you when you get up.”
     
     The next morning, I found her there in her bed, her face blue, a trickle of vomit leaking from her mouth in the early light. The needle was still in her arm. She'd fallen asleep on her back.

     I moved back in with my dad after the funeral. The long trip north was silent. It was always silent with my dad but it was heavier now. Looking back, I think he just didn't know what to even say.
     In the time since I'd last seen him, he'd moved up to Maine to be closer to his family. It was snowing when we passed Bangor, the temperature somewhere in the negatives. The snow blew across the road in this wispy, spiritual way, like sand across a desert. The dead trees and barren farmland appeared like an alien landscape in the dark, lit by the harsh, sterile, white lights of the highway. Even with the heat in my dad's beat up old truck on at full blast, we could still see our breath in the air.
     We finally arrived at the house sometime after 12 AM. My father's home was a small ossuary, barely standing over the snow blanketed oasis that stretched outward in every direction. He had no neighbors, with the exception of an even smaller house that sat across the street.
     We got inside and my dad laid out the ground rules.
     “Firstly, the thermostat doesn't change,” he said. “The gas for the heater comes once a month and I can barely afford that as is. Secondly, no grease can go down the drain. None. If you make soup, dump the broth outside. Otherwise, the pipes will freeze and burst.” He scratched the back of his neck. “And…uh…Thirdly…no parties, alright?”
     Six year old me nodded in agreement, holding Virgil to my chest.
     “Alright. Good talk. Bed's in there,” he said, pointing to my new bedroom. “Love you kid, goodnight.”

    Virgil went missing a week later, while I was at school. I asked my dad where he went. He replied “Whose Virgil?”
     I left food out for him around the house and out on the back porch in hopes he would show. I did this for about a week. At some point, I stopped thinking about him as much. Eventually I forgot him entirely. 
     
     I met Billie when I was fifteen. 
     I didn't have a lot of friends in school. Other than a few kids I hung out with at lunch, the only real friend I had was Lee.
     His full name was Ulysses Dubois. Kids used to make fun of how unusual his name was. A few teachers would crack an occasional joke about it too, more in good fun than outright mocking him. He never really minded it, but his parents hated it. 
     His name had come from a species of butterfly. His mother had told me the story enough times that I could probably tell it for her. The night before Lee was born, she'd dreamt a large, fluorescent butterfly with blue and black wings had landed on her hand. The moment it touched her skin she awoke to contractions.
     It wouldn't be a stretch to say Lee had helicopter parents. His father was a pastor at the local Pentecostal church and his mother was a substitute teacher, and as such he wasn't allowed to do a lot of things when he was a kid. He couldn't play games that weren't rated E10+, even after middle school. Pokémon was off the table as they considered it satanic. He’d never celebrated Halloween. He didn't get a phone until he was 14 and his parents had installed one of those phone tracking apps on it so they knew where he was at all times. 
     Suffice to say, when his mother, who'd been substituting for the neighboring class, overheard his new English teacher say gesundheit after reading his name during rolecall, she didn't take it well.
     We were on the bus that day. Lee's mother had told him she was pulling him out of public school. Neither of us lived within walking distance and neither of us could drive, so we knew we weren't going to be seeing each other too much anymore. Of course neither of us said this out loud. Instead we pitched ideas for band names.
     “What about Institution Solution?” I suggested.
     “What does that mean?” Lee replied.
     I shrugged.
     “I don't know, thought it sounded cool.”
     “Yeah,” he agreed. “But what if we make it really big and someone asks us what it means? Then it's like one of those tattoos of Japanese letters people get where they think it says some stupid shit like ‘Dragon’ or ‘Warrior’ but it actually just says ‘Penis.’”
     I laughed. 
     “Well, do you have something better?”
     “Penis Dragon Warrior?” he replied
     “That could work,” I chuckled. I thought about it for a minute. “What about Nineveh?”
     “What?” Lee replied.
     “Nineveh?”
     Lee had a weird look on his face.
     “Why would we call it Nineveh?”
     “Well,” I began, trying to think of a reason besides my mother. It had been nine years and one month to the day. “I mean it's three syllables, easy to remember.”
     “Is it cause your name is Jonah?”
     “Maybe.”
     My house appeared from the abyss of snow outside the window. My home always reminded me of a corpse, bleak and colorless, like an animal that starved to death in the winter.
     I gathered my things together as the bus slowed to a stop. The girl across the aisle from me did the same. 
     “I'll see you, Lee,” I said as I stood up. Lee nodded. He had a distant look in his eyes.
     The other girl and I stepped off the bus. As she crossed the street to her house, I opened my mailbox and pulled out the letters and bills that had collected since my father left for work last Monday. Working as a cross-country truck driver meant he was rarely home.
     “Hey,” a voice called from behind me. I turned and saw the girl across the street, standing on her porch. “You smoke pot?”
     “Yeah,” I replied.
     I'd never smoked pot in my life.
    “Wanna smoke a joint?” She asked.
     I would later learn her real name was Alice Lillian Wright, named after her mother. However, much to her mother's chagrin, she went by Billie instead. She'd moved into the house across the street about a year ago. I'd seen her around a lot, walking the halls at school and of course on the bus and at our stop. She was usually on her own, aside from the occasional pot dealer or goth kid. In the summer, sometimes I’d see her practice skateboard tricks in her driveway. Despite all the time we'd spent near each other we'd never talked, other than the one morning she said “Bless you,” after I sneezed while waiting for the bus.  
     In the winter, everything is silent. Silent enough that you can probably hear someone cough a mile away. Silent enough that I could hear every time Billie and her mother or step-dad would break into screaming matches. A lot of times she'd show up to school with unexplained bruises. Other kids talked about her sometimes. They'd say her mother was addicted to meth, that her real dad was in jail. She skipped school a lot and she'd gotten suspended three times since she started there, once for getting in a fight with a girl who called her a “lesbo,” once for getting caught with cigarettes, and once for telling Mrs. Haley to go fuck herself after she kept calling her Alice. 
     But as we sat in her bedroom, she said nothing of any of this. She said nothing at all. Instead, she just concentrated on rolling her joint in front of her dresser. 
     I looked around her room, reading the band posters on her walls. Nirvana, Slipknot, Fugazi, Bauhaus, Radiohead.
     “Holy shit, you like Tram?” I said, a bit too excitedly.
     “Yeah,” she replied, running her hand through her short, bleached hair. “They're not bad.”
     “I swear you're the first person I've met that's even heard of them.”
     She kept working on the joint in silence, and I worried I'd already been too much.
     “I like their song ‘Nothing Left to Say,’” she added after a while. She finished the joint and lit it. Taking a couple puffs before turning her chair to face me and passing it.
     I looked at the joint for a moment, pinched between my thumb and pointer. The smell was strong and kind of gross. Something about the way I was holding it or the way I was looking at it must have tipped her off because she stopped me before I tried to smoke it.
     “You know you don't have to if you don't want to,” she said.
     “Yeah, I know.”
     “No, seriously,” she insisted. “Don't be a hero. I'd feel bad if you freaked out.”
     “I won't freak out,” I said as confidently as I could. “It smells good.”
     I took a puff and held it a moment, before breaking into a hacking fit. Billie giggled, and carefully grabbed the joint from my hand before I could drop it.
     “Be honest,” she said once I could breathe again. “You never smoked before, did you?”
     I shook my head.
    “Then that's all you're getting. I don't want you to green out,” she replied as she took a hit. I didn't fight her on it…
    
     “Hey,” Billie said.
     I glanced up to her from the floor. 
     “Yeah?” I replied.
     “The floor is real fascinating, isn't it?”
     “What do you mean?”
     “Dude,” she laughed. “You've been staring at the floor for like five minutes!”
     “I was staring at the floor?”
     Billie cackled and I started laughing too. My whole body felt as though I'd been wrapped in a warm blanket. My eyes were heavy and my tongue was dry. My skin was buzzing…

     “...Ninevah?”
     “What?” I replied.
     “Why'd you want to call your band Ninevah?”
     “How did you know about my band?”
     “Dude…the bus…I sit right next to you.””
     “Oh yeah,” I replied.
     “So is it really just because your name's Jonah?”
     I shrugged…

     …Nothing Left to Say, by Tram, was playing through Billie's Bluetooth speaker. I was laying on the floor on my side. At some point I'd crammed myself somewhat into the crevice between the bed and the nightstand. Billie was laying on the floor across the room, on her back, staring at the ceiling. 
     “I never appreciated how fucking good this song is,” I said.
     “Yeah?”
     “Yeah man.” I rubbed my eyes. “What even is music?” I asked after a while.
     “Oh God.”
     “No, seriously. Like it's just sounds…but they're ordered by like…equal increments of time. And like…only certain sounds work together in certain intervals…and it all somehow means something? I mean how do we even know how to keep rhythm? How can we measure time like instinctually?”
     “What the fuck are you on about, man?” Billie laughed.
     “I don't know. Like isn't time relative? Or a cube or something?”
     “A cube?”
     “Yeah, I think some scientist said it's a cube.”
     “Okay?”
     “But if it's a cube, and not like a line, then why do we see it as a line? And how do we measure that and like use it to make music? Like did we make it all up?”
     “Make up what?”
     “Did we make up time?” I asked.
     “Sure,” she laughed. “Yeah, we made up time.”
     “Weird man,” I said. I grew silent for a while. “It always ends right here,” I said. Then I started to cry. 
      At the time, I didn't understand why. I never cried easily- in fact I couldn't remember the last time I had- but there I was in my neighbors bedroom, sobbing like a baby. 
     “Yo man, you okay?” Billie asked, sitting up. My face grew red and I tried to stop the tears and wipe them off, but I couldn't.
     Billie scooted across the room and sat next to me.
     “You want to talk about it?” she asked quietly. I shook my head. “Okay. Well I'm still here.”
     “I'm sorry,” I said. 
     “Don't be,” she replied…

     “...So then my dad gets out of rehab, right?” Billie continued. We were sitting next to each other now, our backs against the wall. “I think ‘Fuck yeah! Mom doesn't want me anyway. I can go live with dad!’ Then I find out he met someone there, some bitch named Theresa. Once they both got out, they moved in together, got married. Now they have some shitty cul-de-sac house in Massachusetts so he can play step-dad to her kids.” She turned to look at me. I never noticed that her eyes were grey. “I have two step-brothers and a sister, never met any of them. Can't even remember their names. He sends me pictures sometimes but I just throw them out.”
     “You've never gone to his house?” I asked.
     “I never got invited.”
     “What an asshole,” I said.
     Billie shook her head.
     “I don't know,” she replied. “I still miss him. They say that addicts can't be around things that remind them of the drug, and I wasn't an easy kid. I acted out a lot. Maybe he just-”
     Billie trailed off.
     “That's not your fault. Fuck him,” I said.
     “Yeah,” she agreed. “Fuck him.”
     “My dad would probably forget I existed if I didn't live with him. He acts as if he doesn't know he's my dad or something. It's like he's just this roommate I only see once every two weeks.”
     “That sucks,” Billie replied. “What's your mom like?”
     “She was nice. Funny too. Really funny,” I answered. “She died when I was six. Overdose.”
     “Shit,” Billie said quietly. “Well, aren't we a pair.”
     I chuckled. 
     The moment was interrupted by the jingle of keys and the sound of the front door opening.
     “Dammit,” she muttered. “She's not supposed to be home til eight.” 
     “Is she gonna be mad I'm here?”
     “No, you're fine,” she muttered. “I'll deal with it.”
     A moment later, the bedroom door swung open and her mother's face appeared, wide eyed and angry. She was still dressed in her work clothes, her black and grey hair tied back under her McDonald's cap. She glared at Billie, glanced over to me, then back to Billie.
     “Who the fuck is this?” she demanded, gesturing to me. 
     “My friend,” Billie replied.
     “I'm Jonah,” I said awkwardly. Mrs. Wright ignored me. 
     “It smells like pot in here,” she said. “You stealing my shit again?”
     “I got it from Darryl,” Billie replied. “And I never stole your pot. Your boyfriend probably took it.”
     “Watch your tone when you're talking to me,” her mother warned, pointing a finger at her. “And my husband didn't take shit.”
     “Okay.”
     “Excuse me?”
     “I said okay.”
     “That's not what I heard.”
     “Well, that's what I said.”
     Her mother's lip curled into a sneer. 
     “You know I'm getting real tired of this Alice. The lying. The fucking attitude. My shit disappearing.”
     “I didn't steal your fucking pot!” Billie screamed. “Your shit disappears because your high all the time and your husband is a fucking crackhead!”
     “Don't you raise your voice at me, bitch! I'm your mother!” she shouted back. 
     “Get the fuck out of my room!”
     “If I knew that this was where my life would end up…”
     “Get the fuck out of my room!
     “...I would have never had you!”
     “Get the fuck out of my room!”
     “Why couldn't you have been a son?”
     “Get out!” 
     Her mother slammed the door and stormed down the hall. Billie was silent for a long time.
     “I'm sorry,” she said at last. “You should probably leave.”
     “Are you gonna be okay?”
     “Yeah. I'll be alright.”

     I found Virgil when I was sixteen.
     I was hotboxing my room that night, laying in my room and listening to music. My dad had just left earlier in the day and wouldn't be back for two weeks so I figured it was the perfect time to smoke a joint. I still remember the song I was listening to. Since I Was Six, by The Brian Jonestown Massacre.
     “And someday you'll see me
      How I always saw us
     And someday we'll find it
     There in Nineveh""
     I read the poem I'd written for Billie again, thinking I was some kind of lyrical genius. I don't think I ever planned on actually reading it to her, but some part of me had to write it down, and I figured if every band name had to have some kind of meaning, I could just turn it into a song. Of course, I still had to buy a guitar. 
     Billie and I had gotten close in that last year since we met. We were hanging out almost everyday, smoking pot and talking shit about kids at school. Even on days we didn't hang out, we'd stay up late talking on the phone, sometimes falling asleep on the line. We had a collaborative playlist and any time we found a new song we like, we'd add it. I liked her taste in music. It seemed like every song she added became one of my favorites. 
     It's weird falling in love with your best friend. When it came to Billie, I was stuck between two opposite and equally true beliefs: either she felt the same way about me that I felt about her, or there was no world she even thought of me as an option. That feeling is called cognitive dissonance. I'd just learned the phrase in Psychology I. I think I pitched it as a band name once. I folded up the piece of paper and left it on the nightstand. 
     A rustling came from the closet.
     I glanced over and nearly shit a brick as I laid my eyes upon it. It was a little white rabbit, sitting on his haunches and sniffing the air, his nose twitching.
     It had been ten years since Virgil disappeared, and in that time I had somehow forgotten I'd ever even had a rabbit. It took me a moment to recognize him, and when I did I was far more confused than I had already been. 
     “Virgil?”
     The rabbit twitched his head to the sound of my voice, then hopped back into the closet, disappearing behind the corner of the wall. I climbed out of bed, swiftly dropped the joint in the ashtray I'd grabbed from my dad's room, and walked over to the closet, ducking down and crawling underneath the coats and shirts hanging from the rack. It was too dark to see him, so I felt around with my hand, hoping to find the soft fur of Virgil's back. I found nothing, other than the carpet. What was strange, was that I should've felt the left hand wall of the closet.
     I crawled deeper, dipping behind the wall Virgil had hidden behind. I'd gone three feet, then four, then five. I knew it was impossible. I knew where my closet ended. Yet I kept going, feeling the bottom of my clothes brush across my back. Six feet. Seven feet. Eight feet. The deeper I crawled, the less I questioned what was happening. Nine feet. Ten feet. The clothes no longer smelled like my laundry detergent. Now they smelled old, like moth balls. Eleven feet. Twelve feet. I could see light now, dim at first, then brighter. Thirteen feet. Fourteen feet. Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. 
     I crawled out of the closet. I was in a new room now. It looked to be a living room, with a couch and a coffee table. The walls here were all white, with no windows. The light I'd seen had come from a lamp on an end table. I should have been afraid, or at the very least confused, but all I could think about was how nice the light looked, warm like a sunset, washing over the walls and furniture and casting long shadows across the shag carpet. Virgil was waiting for me there, sitting in the middle of the floor. 
     I couldn't name the way I felt in that moment. It was like being six, and waking up in the back of my mom's car late at night to see my house out the window. It was like coming home. 

     I never told my father about the closet. I knew he wouldn't believe it, and I didn't want him to know anyway. It was my secret, a place to go when the outside world was too much. I didn't even tell Billie. It felt irresponsible somehow.
     There were other rooms beyond the living room. The first room had three doors. One lead to a kitchen, another to a bedroom with a queen sized mattress. The third lead to a hallway.
     The hallway had four rooms of its own. One, of course, was the living room. Then, on the opposite wall was a door leading to a small library, complete with bookshelves on each wall and a desk in the middle. This second house even had a bathroom at the right end of the hallway. 
     The last room was the strangest. 
     It was completely empty, other than a large, circular table in the center, and a bright red door on the opposite wall. I'd tried to open it a few times, but it was locked. 
     The last room always gave me a weird feeling when I'd walk in there. My hair would raise from my neck. Despite the fact that (like every other room) there were no windows, I always felt like I was being watched. 
     It wasn't long before I was spending every day after school there. It was easier. I never thought about the problems in my life, my dad, my mom's death. It was my little paradise. Anytime I had a bad day at school or I started to think about things too much, I could just crawl back into the closet and Virgil would be waiting for me.
     Time was different there too. The first night, I spent an hour there. When I finally came back, my joint was still burning in the ashtray, with half of it left to smoke. Sometimes I'd spend what felt like an entire day there, only to come out and realize it'd been no more than half an hour. I think I slept there a few nights. 
     Despite the way time moved differently there, I still found myself missing things in the outside world. I missed a lot of calls, mostly from Lee. I missed the bus a few mornings after going inside to say bye to Virgil, only to get distracted with a book found in the library before, or a new smell I hadn't noticed.
     No, I didn't tell Billie. Not for a month at least. Not until the night she slept over. 
     I was laying in bed when the screaming started. This was nothing new. It seemed like they were fighting every night now. Eventually, there came the crash of glass shattering and everything went silent.
     I texted Billie and asked if she was okay. She read it but never replied.
     I had trouble sleeping after that. I thought about going inside, but I wanted to be there in case something happened and Billie needed help. I'd almost managed to fall asleep after an hour or so, but I was snapped awake by a knock at the front door. 
     When I opened it, Billie was standing there. Her face was streaked with tears. Her arm was stained green and brown. As soon as she saw me she grabbed hold of me and sobbed into my shoulder.
     I’d never seen her cry before. It caught me off guard. Despite everything in her life, she'd always seemed invincible somehow. 
     “She ripped them up,” she managed to say between choked breaths. “All of them.”
     “What?”
     “My pictures. The ones my dad sent.”
     I remembered when she'd said she'd thrown them out. I wondered why she had to lie about something like that.
     “I'm sorry,” I replied, unsure of what to say. 
     “I don't want to be here anymore,” she sobbed. “I want it to end.”
     I knew I shouldn't have told her. I knew it was irresponsible, but I didn't know what else to do. I thought it would make her feel better, at least for a night. At that point, it all felt out of my hands.
     “We don't have to be here,” I replied. She looked up from my shoulder.
     “What?”
     “There's another place.”
     And before I knew it, I was showing her the closet, leading her down that narrow, dark corridor between the real world and that other, impossible place.

**SEEWALDS GRIFT A 1-DAY FAMILY CAMP SAMPLER**

Jessa’s family camp YouTube video gave me 19KAC flashbacks. It felt very much like many episodes of the show, featuring a lot of feedback from the kids (EVEN HENRY…TIL he plays the piano!) and dizzying camera cuts. The family hit the road about 6:30AM. Apparently “Seewald Time” functions better than “Duggar Time,” because all the kids seemed rather perky. On the way, Henry interviews his siblings to find out what they were excited to do at camp. Fern is definitely the long thinker in the family, because she skipped right over family camp to declare that she is going to be an “artist, football girl” who is going to “draw a lot of football stuff” when she grows up. If it weren’t for her fundamentalist pedigree, I would say this girl was going places! 

I’m intrigued by this visit to the family camp, which apparently runs for 3 days (Thursday to  Sunday) and costs $110 per adult and $75 per kid (infants are free). But…at the end of the video, Jessa declares they just went “for the day,” because at 8 months pregnant she is gonna sleep in her own bed. I’m guessing a family tie to the Forsyths gave them an in to come for just the day. They arrived in time for breakfast, went to chapel, did archery, axe throwing, horseback riding, and zip lining, which is a full day indeed, but not worth $520 IMO. 

On the way home, she begs Bin to pull over because she saw a sign for soft serve ice cream. Bin was obliging. I guess he’s learned a thing or two about how to treat a pregnant mama, in spite of the stunning example of his I’ll-sweep-up-crackers-but-still-make-you-crawl under-the-table deadbeat brother-in-law. 

**THIS WEEK ON “KEEPING UP WITH CARLIN”**

Joy continues to give her bestie Carlin a run for her money when it comes to slinging links. The extensive list includes bug spray, kids camping bedding, mom-friendly swimwear that makes Jill’s People Illustrated Swimsuit Edition photoshoot look conservative, a fill-in Dr. Seuss style memory book for kids, dresses, shirts, packing cubes, organizing bins, a car battery jump pack, snack containers, summer outdoor kids toys, headphones, kids sunscreen, her sunscreen, skin repair spray, mascara, a kids swim puddle jumper, and (my personal favorite) a free game app called Travel Town which she and Austin are using as a competition against each other. (Her story promoting the game came on my screen the same evening I was watching Hulu when every other ad was for Royal Kingdom, which made her perky ad seem even more annoying than it already was.)

**3 CHEERS FOR THE BURN BOOT CAMP BRIGADE!!**

Maddie and a not-visibly-pregnant Giggles and Lauren hit the 50 camp mark at Burn Boot Camp. (I was going to say “visibly-not-pregnant,” but with these girls anything is possible.) Lauren is seem wearing a NIKE (swoosh not included) tank top and tight legging shorts, while Kendra is still going strong with the workout skirts. 

I’ve watched an embarrassing about of Burn Boot Camp stories this week tying to spot Dugs, and let me tell you what: that crap is INTENSE! Also, they have childcare, which means they are presumably getting a 45 minute break from their kids a few times a week. (I’m hoping this prevents any laundry room breakdowns.) In spite of Kendra’s tenacious hold on modesty standards, they don’t seem deterred (or defrauded) by all the yoga pants, flopping body parts, and midriffs of their fellow participants…nor convicted about the pulsing demonic workout music…nor bothered by the ever present cameras taking stories for the BBC IG page. (Oh wait, I forgot…the cameras are second nature to them!) 

Finally…some of these Dugs are going multiple times a week! OGJed & Katey get first prize for going 3 times this week (including the holiday). Maddie & Joy (and possibly Lauren) were seen twice. Kendra was seen once, and there was also a possible JD sighting. (These videos pan quickly!) So, these young parents have gained a tiny bit of respect in my book.  

**DUGGAR IN-LAWS FINALLY LOSE BROOMBALL VIRGINITY**

On this week’s episode of the Jer & Jinge podcast, we find out that they have tripled their listeners, so miracles really do happen. We also discover that not only did they lug all their podcast gear from LA to Arkansas, they used their frequent flier miles to bring along….their podcast producer! Talk about dedication. Such servant’s hearts they have. 

They chat all about their riveting trip to Arkansas, talking about everything from ice cream to which siblings they got to see (and which ones they didn’t). Jessa shares how hard it is to be out of the lives of her youngest siblings and “not know what they are into.” I suppose when you have raised a quarter of your own siblings, leaving them behind for your incompetent parents to raise has to be a shock to the system. (Felicity was also VERY confused and asked “Lolli” where all the kids were. Johanna had to explain that they WERE the kids!) We learn that the Tinker Toy House is now the Tinker Toy Farm, and they have chickens, goats, sheep, cattle, and horses. 

Jer waxes vague when he says that the Duggars have had a “rough couple of years” where people had to deal with stuff “in their own way” but that everyone is “in a really good place now.” I would agree, Jer. FCI Seagoville IS a good place for the sex pest. 

But the highlight of the snoozecast is the riveting discussion of how Bin and Jer finally lost their broomball virginity. Apparently, Jinge was the one who begged Jeer (not to be confused with Jer - they spent a solid 2 minutes on this distinction) to set up the family broomball game. Bin and Jer had never played before, so they were in for it. Bin showed up in full hockey gear complete with mask. JB can still do knee slides in his 60s. Chaos and competitiveness was had by all, and Jinger lost her voice.

“Season of Life” mentions in this episode: 6

**TRULY FREE! (OR IS IT?)**

Jinger keeps the hawking simple this week, with only one product…or brand of products. TRULY FREE. She’s switched everything in her home to the brand. Out of sheer curiosity, I decided to do a little snooping into this product. For example, if you want the TF “Everyday Cleaner” You can get an empty 16oz bottle and 2 3-oz “refills” (concentrated, you mix them with water to make the 16 oz) for the amazing price of $16.95. If you count the water you add (which you have to pay for out of your own water bill), it works out to 53 cents per oz. If you exclude the water, it works out to $2.82 per oz plus an empty spray bottle. So, while it may be toxin-free, paraben-free, sulfate-free, gluten-free…and proceeds benefit poor orphan children in Cintrul America…is it really TRULY FREE?!?!?! (It doesn’t seem bullcrap-free to me.)

**VUOLOS VOLLEYING VIGNETTES**

Jinge & Jer continue to land neck and neck in their contest to see who can post the most embarrassing photo of the other. Jeremy came in clutch with 2 shots of Jinge in a sweatshirt and hat…one where she was giving a cringy half smile and the other that was literally completely blurry. Had these two photos not been in the same post, I wouldn’t have been able to tell who it was in the 2nd photo. Someone needs to tell Jeremy that blurry photos are not an art form. So I give this weeks’ medal to Jinger, who posted a real doozy of Jeremy in a coffee shop where he looked like he had just run a 5K. (She also gets bonus points for ACTUALLY running a 5K on the 4th.)

**FOURTH FESTIVITIES**

The family headed many directions for the 4th. Hannah and JerJed went to Nebraska. Jana and Stephen also stayed in Nebraska where they spent the day doing typical 4th things (parades, ceremonies, fireworks, more fireworks, and a reel of everything above set predictably to God Bless the USA.) 

Jin-Jer stayed in LA for a 5K, a parade, and a wedding that included fireworks. (They were also visited by Jeremy’s parents.) 

On the 2nd, Joystin attended “Food Trucks and Fireworks” at the Sr Duggars church (GLBC). Hannie, Jordyn, and Josie were also in attendance as part of the choir. I know this because they were wearing black shirts that read CHOIR in white letters. How creative and cute! 

For the 4th, OGJed & Kathy, Kendra (assuming w/ Joe & the kids), and Joystin Fam attended a true Arkansas party at Drews.gal’s house / barn / farm. There were cowboy boots and a 3 legged race. Austin brought his excavator and attached a rope to it, which was attached to an inner tube that was swung around on a makeshift slip n side. Joy appropriately captioned it “arkansas things.” She also could have captioned it “Duggar Things,” because she blurred out an unnamed girl’s legs and backside when she was on the inner tube. (We sadly did not get to see Joe dry-humping Kendra on an inner tube this time. I guess after that many kids, the romance has died.)

I think it’s \*possible\* Anna and the Minions were there, because there were some little girls who looked a lot like MacKynzie looked when she was younger. There was also a little blonde girl with a heart-emoji-censored face sitting on a chair that had \*ella visibly written in Sharpie on the tag. So I’m guessing Josiah, Lauren, and the Alphabet Gang were also in attendance. 

While it seems like many (if not most) of the Dugs were celebrating the Arkansas way, Jase & Maddie threw a more sophisticated event, complete with handmade bunting, fake red roses, Cokes with gingham ribbons, and sparklers. It looked like there was seating for at least 30 people, but they are keeping the guest list a mystery. 

**#WHERESJENNI MIGHT GO VIRAL AS “FANS” WORRY ABOUT THE LOSTEST OF LOST GIRLS BEING MIA  \~The Sun, probably…**

Jackson, Hannie, and Jordyn were sighted the last two Sunday mornings in their church choir, and 3 of the Lost Girls were present for the Food Trucks and Fireworks event on July 2nd. Jenni has been mysteriously absent from all sightings. #wheresjenni 

**HOLY DISRUPTER GETS DISRUPTED**

Famy took to her stories to bemoan her son saying “mom mom mom mom” constantly whenever he wants something. It bothered her so much she escaped to her hot car for a few minutes to record said stories. I guess disrupting is only holy when she’s the one doing the disrupting. 

**CLOUD ANGEL SPOTTED IN SKY. POSSIBLE LINK TO 2024 CHICKEN NUGGETS MIRACLE?**

Our last story came in at the 11th hour, and I rushed to add this before posting. Tonight Deanna posted a picture of a cloud that looks to be in the form of…an angel. To me, it looks like a plummeting Baymax with the wings of a dove, but you do you Deanna! Could it possibly be Daxton heading back up to heaven to visit Grandma Mary again? Or maybe the angel was returning from another AngelEats chicken nuggets delivery? The heavenly mystery deepens…

—

There were a few other posts that I could have included, but they were either unremarkable or unsnarkable (or both), so they didn’t make the cut. 

Happy Sunday and Happy Snarking!

I need advice.","Disclaimer: I’m not against autistic people — I just don’t like my brother.

I’m a teenage girl living with my older brother (he’s in his late 20s) and some other family members(male dominated household). I’m still studying and working part-time to pay for my own expenses because I don’t receive allowance. I genuinely feel like I’m mentally breaking down.

Since childhood, my brother would hit me during arguments. That stopped only because my dad had a talk with him, but the emotional abuse never ended. Anytime we argue — even over small things like me asking how his day was — he crashes out and tells me to die or kill myself. It happens every time. He once admitted to me that he says that because he knows it breaks me.

every time he is arguing He insults me for not doing well in school, tells me I don’t help the family (even though I do housework and pay for everything myself), and blames me for not supporting the household financially like he does. For context, my dad still financially supports my mom and younger sister because he wants to be a father figure — but he’s stretched thin. Sometimes my dad asks my brother to lend money, and I think he doesn’t always  pays him back, so maybe that’s why my brother is so stingy.

Even when we had no food at home, my brother wouldn’t buy me anything unless he was told to do so from my dad or he was given money by me/my dad. On rare occasions he does,he brings it up later in arguments to make himself look good.

One of the most disgusting things he’s done: when I was around 15/16, we had a bad fight and while I was in school, he texted me calling me a sl**who sleeps with boys in my class and other sexual slurs. (I can’t say it openly coz it’s gonna get removed from Reddit)  That was absolutely not true. Idk what the hell he has been watching or thinking about for him to be talking so cheap. I cried so hard n  came home trying to defend myself, but my dad just brushed it off, saying he had already “talked to him” and that I should move on. Everyone excused it. I was so disgusted, I couldn’t look at my brother for weeks. Eventually, I let it slide like always. End of the day idk why but no matter how horrible they treat me I still feel like I miss having a bond with them even though there is no bond lol idk what is wrong is me but I prolly have some attachment issues. He still says horrible things to me, but at least not sexual stuff anymore.

He’s manipulative too. He tells twisted stories about me to my grandpa, and then my grandpa complains about me to my dad — which makes my dad lash out at me unfairly. One time, I made coffee for my dad before work, but he refused to bring it. Later he told me, “I don’t want your coffee. I can buy it anywhere. You’re poisonous, just like your mother.” That shattered me.

My grandpa is very sexist. When he needs help, even if my brother is just lying down and I’m busy, he only asks me. If I say, “Can you ask my brother instead?” he gets angry and says I’ll never be a good family girl material. My brother just agrees with him. Saying if I don’t do this how can I be a good wife to my husband in the future like w** shut the hell up. I’m the one who cooks, cleans, and helps out, but I’m treated like trash — like a maid with no love in return. During exam season, like they knew I was taking my finals but even then I was still expected to clean the house daily.  There was a point in my life I had high school  prom but my dad was not willing to pay for me lol. But I still wanted to experience girlhood and stuff so I started working for the first time. But then I was so overwhelmed, I got physically sick from working long shifts to afford my prom, skipping meals, and pushing myself.

I even had to go for medical tests due to how bad my health got. I paid nearly $100 for the tests out of my own salary. My dad blamed me for not taking care of myself. He didn’t even help with my prom expenses — I paid for everything alone with my  bare minimum weekend job and a school award that provides us financial aid for studying well. That’s how I finally bought the phone I wanted too.

I’ve always been treated like an outsider in my own home. The men in the house — my dad, grandpa, and brother — talk to each other, support one another. They only talk to me when they want something.

Today was my breaking point. I got kicked out of my room and now sleep in the living room. At 4am, my brother turned on the dining room lights to airfry some food, (he got sleeping problems he can’t sleep) even though the kitchen light was already on and enough. The light was shining directly in my face while I was trying to sleep. I signaled him to turn it off (he always understands), but he ignored me. When I finally spoke, he told me to die — again. I started crying and couldn’t sleep after that. When I texted him asking why he’s being so inconsiderate, he said it’s because he was angry about having to hang my grandpa’s clothes.

I was at work when those clothes ran out. I’m the only girl in the house, and still I’m expected to do everything. If he helps even once, everyone praises him like a hero. I do it every day and no one notices.

Backstory (summarized):
My brother was diagnosed with autism in his teens. I was too young to understand the details, but I heard my mom (who also had autism) raised him in a very neglectful way when my dad was busy — locking him in rooms and leaving him alone. Which is probably why he developed this condition overtime even though he was normal at first? He was bullied badly in school for being different and overweight which made him stop studying altogether. Eventually, through support, he got a decent job.

But he’s always had a bad attitude. He purposely slacked off, skipped work, and tried to get fired.  Later on we moved states. My dad helped him find a better job that was close to home, but he acted the same: rude to managers, refused to do tasks, misread social cues, and made a female coworker uncomfortable. He eventually quit without telling anyone, and now works irregular hours only when someone else is on MC. He still shows up late or skips work often.

My family members often see me crying or sometimes they see exactly what is happening to me but they choose to act blind. Even if it’s not related to home and I just cry due to my own reasons they won’t check up on me but they will be literally watching their phone right in front of me. And in that same day even tho they saw me cry I expect them to be nice so I would ask them small favours but they treat me like I was being entitled. Atp I’m just used to getting called useless and every other slurs the whole time

Despite all this, I’m always told to “understand” and that I’ll have to take care of him when he’s older. But I don’t want to take care of someone who’s emotionally abusive, manipulative, and ungrateful.

I’m exhausted.

I am watching Scandal. I don’t know why I didn’t watch it when it first aired; maybe I was busy? Anyway, I am loving binge-watching this! I’m only on episode 2, so no spoilers, please. 


I’m 33 years old and split my time between two locations in the United States, working across both Eastern Daylight Time and Pacific Time Zones. My work life is quite hectic and intense, leaving little room for frivolous distractions, but I pride myself on being fair and kind.

I strive to find the good in people and trust my intuition. While I have a close-knit group of friends, many of them are married with children, which makes it challenging for us to spend time together. I completely respect their priorities, but I sense that our paths are starting to diverge. At this point, I'm not looking to connect with my married friends; instead, I'm open to forging new friendships with those who are divorced, as long as we can avoid any drama related to ex-partners—life is simply too short for that.

I recently ended a serious engagement and came to the difficult realization that I didn’t love him enough to move forward with marriage. Making that decision was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Now, I’m taking some time for myself and focusing on building friends  only.


As an avid reader and dedicated audiobooks lover, I find great joy in diving into stories, especially while on the go. Listening to books allows me to indulge in literature conveniently, and there’s something truly enchanting about the experience of being read to! I often increase the playback speed to double time, so if you’re interested in chatting about books, I’d be thrilled to do so. Recently, I was profoundly touched by ""The River is Waiting"" by Wally Lamb; while it was an emotional read, it made a lasting impact on my heart and changed my perspective on important issues. That’s what I find so beautiful about books!

Music holds a special place in my life. I'm currently curating a dinner playlist that’s coming together wonderfully, featuring talents like Kacey Musgraves and Ella Fitzgerald. I’ve even created a 20-hour playlist that spans a variety of genres. Recently, I discovered the band ""The Scarlet Opera,"" and I’m really enjoying their vibe. Since I have Apple Music, I’d love to share my playlists if you’re interested!

I have a deep appreciation for theater, ballet, and opera. There’s something truly magical about dressing up to witness these extraordinary performances. However, I also love TV and movies. While I enjoy the thrill of getting ready for a night out, I equally treasure the cozy comfort of wearing sweatpants and a concert t-shirt at home.

I’m passionate about dining out and exploring new restaurants. Although I do enjoy cooking at home, I’ve found myself in a phase where going out for brunch and dinner with friends is my primary focus. I’m a big fan of iced coffee and love sharing plenty of champagne with great company! Food in general—especially brunch and lunch—is one of my favorite passions!

I've had the pleasure of traveling quite extensively, from the beautiful beaches of Bali to the romantic streets of Paris and the stunning landscapes of Kenya, even covering all 50 states in the process. At this point, it feels like I've crossed off most of the destinations from my travel wishlist. However, I'm always ready to recommend some great restaurants no matter which city you mention!

I'm on the lookout for someone between the ages of 26 and 50 who lives in the United States and shares my preference for voting blue. Sports and video games aren't really my thing, so if those are your main interests, we might not be a great match. Also, I'm not into hiking or camping, just to keep that in mind!",0,1751857584.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.33,False

Since she’s entering her teenage phase she’s definitely regressed and I am looking for advice on a plan I came up with! 

She is very reactive towards cars, sometimes people and other dogs so I will stick to the same potty times as we’ve been doing for 8 months, but instead of walking her in the neighborhood (I live in a condo), I will be only walking her in the grassy area by my building where there is no triggers 99% of the time. She normally will not poop here, but I’m thinking if she decides to hold it, we’ll go out more often and if she goes in the house, she’ll go back to being restricted to a pen when i’m not watching her. 

The long walks will be supplemented with recall training, snuffle mats, kongs or puzzle toys and more playtime inside, consisting of fetch, place training, and threshold training.

She hasn’t been barking much at hallway noises, but when she does, it’s immediately redirecting or treating when she doesn’t bark.

Back to crate training, she hasn’t been destructive, not once in the last 8 months, but last night she chewed on my coffee table so it’s back to crate training instead of restricted to the living room while I’m gone. This will also go hand in hand with place training and not barking when I leave the condo. 

In the elevator she sometimes gets antsy with other people in there since the building requires us to hold our dogs and she’ll bark at them. So instead we’ll take the stairs and if I absolutely need the elevator I did get a muzzle, but she’s not used to it just yet.  

Is there any advice you guys can add or give me to make this a good plan? I really want to be consistent and be considerate to my neighbors. They’re all very understanding, but with my annoyance with her recently, I can’t help but feel guilty for them as well.

I’m from Europe, where BBW isn’t sold in every country, but I now have a chance to order from abroad. I don’t have a minimalist perfume collection, but I also try to avoid blind-buying things I won’t end up using, even if they’re a good deal. So far, I only own a coconut body mist from The Body Shop which I adore.

My taste:
Favorites include YSL Black Opium, Replica Coffee Break, Armani Acqua di Gioia, Novellista Citrus Affair.
I also enjoy good cheapies like Lush Dirty, Katy Perry Indie, Yves Rocher Vanilla, Zara Vanilla Bloom and Bohemian Oud, Antonio Banderas Seduction line.

I like layered, well-blended fruity or dessert gourmands (as long as they’re not too synthetic), fresh/spicy/aromatics, and even interesting clean scents.

So…
	•	Are there BBW mists that perfume lovers actually consider high-quality or worth it?
	•	Which BBW scents are the safest blind buys for someone with my taste?
	•	Are there any that feel like “dupes” or cousins of the perfumes I like?
	•	Do they last well or are they just good for layering/around-the-house wear?

I tackled multiple root causes. GERD, dry mouth, oral Hygiene and ph. 

Some of these are permanent fixes, others are easy changes, and some are habits. 

Mouth breathing at night. 

* I solved this with mouth tape. Medical tape works great. Also, using biotene before sleeping with mouth tape helps reduce mouth dryness.


Better breathing through the nose. 

* I solved this through a septoplasty. 

Nasal drip. 

* I stopped eating spicy foods, which I used to do almost every meal. Septoplasty helped. 

Tonsile stones

* I solved this through a full tonsillectomy.

PH balance 

* I solved this by eliminating major sources of acid. Coffee and soda :( 

* I used arm and hammer toothpaste to balance my ph.

 Mouth Hygiene 

* I try to floss, brush, and gargle after every meal. It isn't always realistic to do this, but for the majority of the time try.

*  Therabreath 

* tongue brush and then tongue scrape. 

* biotene oral rinse

Silent GERD (acid reflux)

This was a big one, and likely the root cause of my tonsile stones and maybe acidic breath (sour smell). This was a multi-pronged approach, but nothing complex. I would start here honestly if you have GERD. 

* Angled bed to physically reduce acid moving up the esophagus. 

* Eliminate trigger foods - spicy, fried, coffee (my favs). 

* Reduce portion size. 

* Gaviscon. 

* No food within 3 hrs of sleeping


Results:

* Tonsile stones eliminated
* Better breathing
* White Tongue  almost eliminated
* Dry mouth gone
* Elminated phlegm in throat (used to be an every morning activity)

* And our course, pretty neutral breath! ",1,1751857123.0,badbreath,1,1.0,False

1ltj8m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1ltj8m8/different_flavors_of_the_same_thing/,Different flavors of the same thing,"I’ve had two partners emotionally abuse me in the last year.

One was a covert narcissist. He was so subtle, I couldn’t even explain what he was doing to me in a way that would make sense to others as abuse. He learned my deepest vulnerabilities and would create situations to put me down and hurt my feelings, all so he could make me feel better and show how he was the good guy and I was just sensitive. Somehow I was always apologizing to him for my feelings. He was truly sinister. It felt like my mind was stuck in a trap. I was scared of him even though he’d never raised his voice or called me names, but still, it felt impossible to leave.

The partner I met after that was sweet and emotionally available. He respected my boundaries and helped me to heal a lot from my relationship with my ex. He made me feel special and important and seen…until it came to conflict. If my feelings were hurt, he could only be sorry if the problem was because I was sensitive or triggered. Nothing was ever his fault. Our relationship was mostly good and I believe he loved me, but every now and then he would be triggered by my hurt feelings and blow up. It didn’t matter how gently or non-accusatory I brought up issues were. I’d seen how he could be unreasonable and reactive with others, so I wasn’t completely unaware. I just underestimated how cruel he could be when angry. He never called me names, but he was the king of DARVO. I broke up with him when he blew up at me for telling him my feelings were hurt by something he did, and he lost it. A week later we met to try and work through things and he was emotionally abusive in public—telling me what I could and couldn’t say, didn’t let me shake my head, wouldn’t let me say the word “you” or use specific examples of things that happened during our breakup, things I had in writing that he was denying. I was so triggered by his contempt and aggression that I ran away from him and hid behind a garbage can in public at a coffee shop. It was painful and humiliating and heart breaking.

It was hard to accept that my most recent ex was abusive toward me, because we didn’t have an abusive relationship. I loved him. He loved me. He made me feel so safe and seen. He could hear my concerns most of the time. I don’t think he wanted to abuse me. At the coffee shop he seemed scared at how he was acting. It doesn’t erase or excuse what he did. Ultimately, it’s his choice to not acknowledge his behavior or get help. 

It’s so confusing to have these two experiences side by side. I hate my narcissist ex. I’m angry at my other ex, I no longer love him and would never take him back, but I don’t hate him. To an outsider, I feel like my most recent ex seems like more of an abuser based on his actions, but the truth is that my narcissistic ex was more manipulative and desired to hurt me. My most recent ex didn’t want to hurt me…It felt like he was trying to protect himself and unfortunately when he is triggered, emotional abuse is his defense mechanism.

I don’t know if this makes sense to anyone. I’m heartbroken that my most recent ex shattered my sense of safety with him. I’m shattered that once again, I cared for someone who ended up abusing me. But I’m also proud of myself that as soon as he engaged in abusive behaviors toward me, I ended the relationship, even though I still loved him.

It’s been over four months since we broke up and I am finally done wishing he would fix things. I’ve accepted what happened and that we will never reconcile. He can’t fix this. 

What a mind fuck. I tell myself that I couldn’t have known. I didn’t miss anything with my most recent ex, like I did with my narc ex. I wasn’t duped or fooled. But still…I’m so sad for myself. I’m so sad that I attract abusers. I’m sad that I’ve had to learn these lessons. I’m a child of emotional neglect and abuse, but I’ve healed a lot. I no longer need anyone’s validation to feel my worth. I hope that will help me to avoid falling for another person who will abuse me.

In the end, I guess it doesn’t matter whether or not the abuse was intentional with my most recent ex. It doesn’t matter if he truly loved me or if he was “an abuser”. The fact is that he was emotionally abusive toward me and refused to change or repair and is not someone who can be a safe partner.

I don’t know why I’m sharing this. I don’t know what I want from sharing my experience. I guess I am hoping that others out there might feel similarly. It’s such a lonely and isolating experience. I don’t think my friends understand how complicated it is. 

If you’ve read all of this, thank you for hearing me. I guess that’s all I really needed.

Hey friends! 🌟 Ever feel like you just can’t quite keep up with that youthful vigor we all remember? I mean, who wouldn’t want to harness that endless energy of our 20s, right? A while back, I stumbled upon an energy hack that completely transformed my daily routine. And guess what? It’s perfect for us 50 and over! So grab your favorite cup of coffee (or tea, I don’t judge), and let’s chat about it.

First off, let’s face it—those energy dips around 3 PM hit harder as we age. It’s like our bodies conspired against us. But here's the kicker: **who says we need to accept it?** There are ways to reclaim that pep in our step and stay focused without the dreaded jitters of coffee overdose.

Here’s what I’m talking about:

- **Stay Hydrated:** Seriously, this one’s a game changer! Lack of hydration can zap your energy faster than a power outage. I keep a water bottle handy and aim for *at least* eight glasses a day. Your body will thank you!

- **Mind Your Munching:** Ever notice how some snacks give you a sugar rush followed by a crash? Instead, I’ve switched to nuts, seeds, and whole grains. They’re like little energy powerhouses! Believe me, snacking smarter makes all the difference.

- **Get Moving:** I started incorporating short walks into my routine. Even just **10-15 minutes** can help boost my mood and energy. Plus, it's a perfect excuse to step away from the screen for a bit—win-win!

- **Mindfulness Matters:** Practicing mindfulness or meditation for just a few minutes can clear the mental fog. I know, I know—some folks think it's “woo-woo,” but honestly, sitting quietly and being present works wonders. 

- **Nourishing Nights:** Quality sleep really is the base of our energy pyramid. Trying to aim for a solid **7-8 hours** makes all the difference. I’ve even established a chill evening routine—goodbye, late-night screen time!

Oh, and before I forget, I recently came across a tool that ties all these energy hacks together pretty nicely. It’s right up our alley! **We believe in meaningful results.** Check it out here: [Mavely](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb). It’s fantastic for tracking habits and keeping you accountable in this energy journey!

Have you tried any of these hacks? What are your go-to tricks for feeling energized without the jitters? Let’s swap ideas and keep motivating each other! Remember, it’s all about finding what works best for you. Here’s to thriving, not just surviving! Cheers! 🌼",1,1751856601.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

## key Features Analysis

The performance and reliability of a 2500-watt power inverter largely depend on its technical specifications. These specifications dictate how well the inverter converts DC power to AC power, as well as its ability to handle different types of loads and protect against potential hazards.**Continuous Power Rating:** This is the amount of power the inverter can provide continuously. A 2500-watt inverter should reliably supply 2500 watts of continuous power. It’s crucial to check if the manufacturer specifies the output under different input voltage conditions (e.g., 12V, 24V). If the inverter lacks sufficient continuous power, it could shut down unexpectedly, damaging connected tools and appliances.

**Peak Power Rating:** This indicates the maximum power the inverter can supply for a short period, typically during startup.A good 2500-watt inverter should have a peak power rating of at least twice its continuous rating (e.g.,5000 watts) to handle the surge of power required by many appliances,like refrigerators or power tools,when they first turn on. If the peak power rating is too low, larger appliances may not start correctly.

**Waveform Type:** Power inverters produce either a pure sine wave or a modified sine wave output. Pure sine wave inverters provide a cleaner, more stable power supply that is suitable for sensitive electronics, such as laptops, audio equipment, and certain medical devices. Modified sine wave inverters are more affordable but may not be compatible with all devices and can sometimes cause interference or reduce the lifespan of sensitive electronics.

**Efficiency:** The efficiency rating indicates how much of the DC power from the battery is converted into usable AC power.A high-efficiency inverter minimizes power loss and extends battery life. look for inverters with an efficiency rating of at least 85% or higher. This means more of the DC power will be used,and less of it will be lost as heat. Lower efficiency can lead to quicker battery drain and more heat generation.

**safety Features:** Essential safety features include overload protection, over-temperature protection, short-circuit protection, and reverse polarity protection. Overload protection safeguards the inverter from excessive power draw. Over-temperature protection prevents overheating which can damage the inverter and connected devices. Short-circuit protection prevents damage due to electrical shorts. Reverse polarity protection prevents damage if the battery is connected incorrectly. These features collectively ensure that the inverter and connected appliances are protected against common electrical issues.

**Cooling System:** A robust cooling system is crucial for preventing overheating,especially when running the inverter at high loads. Power inverters typically use fans or heat sinks (or a combination of both). consider models equipped with variable-speed fans that adjust their speed based on the inverter’s temperature to reduce noise and conserve energy. Overheating can cause the inverter to shut down and possibly damage the inverter itself.

## Core benefits

A high-quality 2500-watt power inverter offers significant benefits for a variety of applications, from powering tools at remote job sites to providing backup power during emergencies. These benefits increase both convenience and safety.

**Increased Mobility and Flexibility:** With a 2500-watt inverter, you can use many AC-powered devices virtually anywhere. For contractors, this means running power tools at remote job sites without needing a generator or access to mains power. Campers can enjoy the comforts of home by running appliances like coffee makers or portable refrigerators. This adaptability provides far more flexibility in outdoor and off-grid settings.

**Emergency Power Backup:** During power outages, a 2500-watt inverter can provide a vital backup power source for essential appliances. When paired with a car battery or a solar panel system,it can power lights,refrigerators,medical equipment,and communication devices,ensuring safety and comfort during prolonged outages.By connecting to a car battery you can quickly turn transportation into an emergency power resource.

**Cost Savings:** Using a power inverter can lead to significant cost savings compared to relying on generators or other power sources. Generators require fuel and regular maintenance, while power inverters (especially when paired with solar panels) offer a more enduring and cost-effective solution over the long term. the use of renewable energy sources,such as solar,can minimize reliance on the grid and therefore contribute to long-term fuel savings.

**Environmentally Pleasant:** Power inverters, especially when used with renewable energy sources like solar panels, offer a more environmentally friendly alternative to generators. Generators produce emissions and noise pollution, while inverters provide clean and quite operation. Inverters allow one to utilize renewable energy sources and reduce one's carbon footprint.

**Protection of Sensitive Electronics:** Pure sine wave inverters provide a clean, stable power supply that protects sensitive electronics from damage. Devices like laptops, smartphones, and medical equipment require a consistent power supply to function correctly, and a pure sine wave inverter ensures they receive it. A consistent sine wave protects more expensive electronics from suffering damage due to power spikes and inconsistencies.

## FAQs Section

**What size battery do I need for a 2500-watt inverter?**
To determine the appropriate battery size, calculate the current draw of the inverter at its maximum output (2500 watts). At 12V, this would be approximately 208 amps (2500W / 12V = 208.33A). Use a battery with sufficient amp-hour (Ah) capacity to handle this load for the desired duration. A deep-cycle battery is recommended for its ability to withstand repeated charge and discharge cycles.

**Can I run a refrigerator with a 2500-watt inverter?**
Yes, a 2500-watt inverter can run most refrigerators. Though, refrigerators require a high surge of power when starting (frequently enough 2-3 times their running wattage). Ensure that the inverter's peak power rating is high enough to handle this startup surge. Check the refrigerator’s power requirements, including both the running wattage and the startup wattage, to confirm compatibility.

**How long will a 2500-watt inverter run on a car battery?**
The runtime depends on the battery's capacity (measured in amp-hours) and the load being drawn. A typical car battery has a capacity of around 50-100 ah. To calculate the approximate runtime, divide the battery's capacity by the current draw of the inverter. For example, with a 100 Ah battery and a 200-amp draw, the runtime would be approximately 30 minutes (100 Ah / 200 A = 0.5 hours). Keep in mind that drawing a battery down completely can damage it,so it's best to use only 50-70% of its capacity.

**What are the main differences between a pure sine wave and a modified sine wave inverter?**
Pure sine wave inverters produce a power signal that closely resembles the waveform found in a household AC supply. This makes them suitable for sensitive electronics and devices with motors. Modified sine wave inverters produce a more “stepped” waveform and are less expensive but may not be compatible with all devices.Modified sine waves can cause some equipment to overheat or run inefficiently.

Act 1- Northside

Your reasons are known only to you, but somehow, you ended up walking the path of a mercenary.  Maybe, you were looking to escape from a bad home, maybe you need some extra eddies in your pocket, maybe you just like hurting people.  Whatever the case, you've got an uphill climb from here.  But hey, you've got a roof your head (for now at least), an iron on your hip, and a head full of dreams.  And if there's one thing Night City loves more than anything, it's dreams.  After all, a start as low as this will just make your legend all the greater, right?

Act 2- Japantown

Well, I'll be damned, you actually survived your first few jobs.  You found a low-level fixer desperate enough to give you a job, and then a couple more, and next thing you know, you've gone from making small-talk with the roaches on the walls to actually needing an elevator to get to your apartment.  As your brand new cyber-eyes take in the view of the streets below, your fixer calls you in for another job.  Things are actually going pretty well.  But you know that you've still got a long way to go.

Act 3- The Glen

You made it.  By god, you made it.  You've hit the big leagues now.  You've taken on the toughest gigs, chipped yourself to hell and back, and maybe even murdered an innocent or two along the way (honestly, it's hard to keep track these days).  You've probably got enough eddies hoarded in some offshore account to buy yourself a cozy villa in North Oak, but you and I both know that you could never leave this life behind.  So, as you sip your freshly brewed coffee while sitting on your real leather couch, you decide to ring up Rogue to see if she's got anything to help you kill time.  To your utter lack of surprise, she says she's got a few things that could be up your alley.  As you ring the valet to bring your Rayfield to the door, you wonder how you ever survived like this before.  Now if only that chick behind the bar would put your drink on the menu...

Act 4- Corpo Plaza

It all started with one job.  Then, you proved yourself useful.  More jobs started coming your way from higher up the ladder, and before you knew it, you were signing a contract as an ""independent contractor"".  The suits take good care of you: a luxurious apartment in the plaza, top-shelf implants, military-grade weapons, the whole kit and caboodle.  All they ask in return is that you solve their problems for them, and don't become a problem yourself.  Sounds like as good a deal as ever was.  As you finish off your 3rd glass of imported Brazilian wine, a thought pops into your head: Was this all worth it?  What did it cost to get here?  Fortunately, your implants detect these preposterous thoughts and immediately bury them under a healthy dosage of serotonin and dopamine.  Maybe you'll swing by the Afterlife later on and...

Well they too are ramping up a new location and it's going to be on the NW corner of Country Club & Southern (possibly in the old 99¢ store space) Shamrock is open to the public and is way smaller, but they have good stuff there.  If you like coffee syrup, there's lots of  options there and you can buy giant containers of Thrifty/Shamrock ice cream and other restaurant size containers of food products.  I get my Cambro storage containers there.  The new Shamrock should be open in the October/November time frame I'm told.  It's nice to see new locations in the East valley.

While she was a student I completely understood. However, this as persisted as she has taken on a very high paying lucrative career. She makes \~$600k annually, and has no debt or family that she's supporting. She has no financial trauma that we know of, she grew up in an average middle class family.

  
When we go out for meals, if there is any discrepancy in cost she will ask to split exactly based off what we ordered (even if I ordered something $2 more expensive). We never gift each other anything, whereas with other friends it's very much I'll grab a coffee here, or cover the tab today. It's noticeable even when she orders off the menu - I'll see her going for the cheapest item.  


I make significantly less than her, but enough that I'm not worried about a dollar here or there - I truly believe it will all even out over time/ I'm not that concerned if it doesn't either.. She is extremely consistent - she always makes sure we're not covering for her more expensive orders either. I don't feel at all ripped-off by her, but I do find the whole calculating to the penny to be pretty annoying, and honestly confusing. I feel like I have no right to be annoyed by this, but I do find myself getting frustrated - it just seems petty and somewhat transactional. I thought it would decrease over time as she has increased her income, but we've seen it go the other way - now she's gotten more concerned about cash back/rewards. Beyond my annoyance, I am somewhat concerned about her - I can tell she's stressed about money, and she's in a position where she doesn't need to be. I am very confident that there's nothing more going on that she would need this money for.

Our friends were kinda invalidating her relationship, one of our friends kept flirting with her ""as a joke"" and she started to feel bad about it, so i had to cheer her up, even if it kinda hurted me. I started seeing other people, even fucked with a random guy i meet, but the feeling never disappeared. We kept getting closer, i would buy her food and she would buy me coffee after our long study sessions, we didn't even think about calling our group to study, we worked well together.

Her mom loved me, she kept offering me food, her mom and dad said she talks about me with them, i just laughed and she was kinda nervous, she is pretty relaxed and talkative in uni but now she seemed shy.

I know is weird, but i really wanted to sleep in the same bed with her, but obviously she slept in the same bed with her sister (we are both 18 and she is 16), we still kept talking and joking, then in a moment when we were joking about the music, she went and got on top of me, i froze in place and said ""get tf off laughing, her sister, half asleep, asked her ""what the f are you doing?"" we both laughed and she went back to bed. I couldn't sleep well, today morning she took me to the bus stop in a awkward silence and then i went home.

What the hell do I do?,"I met a woman (I'll call her J) in 2021 in my office building. We're in the same field running private practices.  We had a very casual work friendship, maybe interacting once a month with a coffee chat maybe 3 times over the course of 2 years before I moved out of the building.  J kept in touch to ask business related questions, and eventually it became apparent we had the same goals.  After a business meeting a year ago where we discussed expanding our businesses in a similar way, I asked J if she'd like to partner with me and she was very enthusiastic.  

Our working relationship is fantastic, we fell into a grove easily, and a dynamic developed where she leads the vision and I make sure everything is in pace to execute it.  She's more or less the face and Im the backend of many aspects.  This dynamic is where things started to go off the rails for me.

It turns out this dynamic is pretty attractive to me.  I kept myself in check pretty easily for a while, but as we learned more about each other I realized that not only are our business goals aligned but so are our life goals.  It also turns out that we are really compatible with how we like to spend our time outside of work.  We have similar hobbies, sports, and interests, which range from fine dining to arduous, niche outdoor adventures.

Nothing romantic has ever been exchanged between us.  Its possible to interpert some of her slack messages as flirty, but also could be interpreted as being positive and motivating.  Example: ""Youre the best business partner I could ask for!"" and ""I appreciate you so much.""

I brought up the idea of J and I doing something for team building and bonding with the explicit goal of improving our trust and problem solving.  It went great.  Now J brings up many things we can do to bond, including roller blading, playing golf, and paddle boarding.

Then J let me know she was having problems in her marriage.  I told her take however much space she needed.  She confided in me about what was happening, and I remained neutral and mostly just validated her experience.  J decided to separate and is now living separately from her husband.

Recently we went paddleboaring together, which was her idea.  Her idea was to sit on the front of my paddleboard and have me paddle us around. We talked about work and life as she sat casually snacking and relaxing while I escorted us around the lake. After, J brought up several more things for us to do together so we can continue to bond. 

I'm getting really confused. All of our shared interests, trust building,  mutual respect and appreciation, shared life goals - it's like a switch got flipped and I cant turn it off. J and I seem so compatible. I didnt got into this with any intention other than having a successful business. Now I cant stop thinking about having a successful marriage, life, and business together.

I never ask her to spend time together outside of work, I've never flirted, Ive tried to keep things really professional.  And now Im really falling for her and I dont know what to do. Not only is she still married, but we have a business relationship. The romantic in me doesn't care about the consequences on our business, but I also dont want to seem like a vulture and swoop in while she's vulnerable during her separation.  

What are some things that I should be thinking about as I continue to navigate my feeling for J given our working relationship and her not yet finalized divorce?

My mom had back pain in February, went and got an MRI and they had found lesions on her spine indicating cancer that had spread. She went and got it checked out. She calls me one day, and tells me she has lung cancer. My mom has smoked since she was 14. Eventually, the doctor makes a care plan for her which involved sessions of radiation and chemotherapy. 

Once this began she just fell off bad. She went from 150 pounds down to 130, which stopped the doctor from doing any treatment at all since she would not eat, she would just drink water and coffee and that was that. She is now down to 110. She had to go on a feeding tube. 

She eventually went to a rehab center and also made some strides but was just very weak. Last Friday we get a call from the rehab that her oxygen was extremely low and that she had to be taken to the hospital to have a breathing tube put in. I saw her right after it was done, I rushed out of work and I will forever be traumatized by it. She had the tube down her throat, and her eyes were just not even there. It was awful and I just started crying so hard and had to leave. I went back to see her the next day and she was fully aware, eyes open, restrained cause they didnt want her to mess with the tube. Along with this they had to put her on a feeding tube since she wasnt eating. Without it the doctor said she would've died awhile ago. 

Then July 4th. A doctor calls my whole family in the waiting room that my mom has chosen to stop all treatment, and return home with hospice. She mentioned that my mom is at the end of her life and described it as my mom being tired. She also mentioned the breathing tube is no longer an option as she wouldn't be able to come off of it. She's mentally there, and can talk but not frequently. If you talk to her she'll respond but her speaking is kind of muted. She can't speak much, just kind of mutters up enough energy to say things. She held my hand today, and I visit every day, went and cleaned up my grandparents living room for her so shes comfortable. 

I guess I'm just wondering where and what to do from here. I feel kind of lost in terms of how to support her. I am fully willing to bathe, clean, make sure she always has a clean bed, etc. I love her and want her to feel beautiful despite this state. 

Everything changed after she got treatment. She just became so weak, slept a lot. Like all of her spark was gone.

Just seeing if anyone has any experience and where to go from here because I have literally no clue what to think, expect, etc. ",8,1751854949.0,hospice,1,1.0,False

1ltionc,https://i.redd.it/mupede104dbf1.jpeg,5 months no contact,"Should I respond to this text? 

This is gonna be a long one but here is the background of the relationship…..To give some context I’m 27(M) she’s 27(F). We met in September from hinge and everything was going well. She was pursuing me and was really into me. I liked her a lot we had a lot in common and got along well. We would go on dates often and see each other a few times a week, we would also workout together. She met my family all my friends and we were progressing towards a more serious relationship. I fell hard, I would bring her flowers, bring coffee to her work and surprise her with anything she liked because I genuinely saw a future with her. (Honestly would have done anything for her).

A few months later, around end of December, she texted me out of the blue saying she needed space. Didn’t really clarify what or why. I have always been secure but this relationship made me very anxious. So, I started pushing the more I did the more she pulled away. Leading up to her saying she “needed space.” I tried asking what she meant and asked her if it’s me or this relationship and she said it wasn’t me she’s just overwhelmed with her life and everything going on and needed space. I did notice she was canceling plans or delaying plans on weekends last minute saying she was busy, or she had so much to do and would text me when I could come see her. She made up a lot of excuses like she wanted to spend time with her mom but at the same time would complain she doesn’t have enough alone time and sees her mom too much. It didn’t make much sense. I tried to give her a few days space but was really going crazy and eventually kept pushing wanting to know what was up. 

Fast forward about a week after that. Things returned relatively normal. I was still pretty anxious and on edge all the time but we would see each other a few times a week just for the gym. She was still avoiding hanging out on weekends with me. I didn’t really push it because she did have a lot going on she had an injury to her knees. She had seen several doctors and still couldn’t figure out what was wrong (this was going on for months before we met). There was also very little intimacy. When I tried to initiate she would come up with an excuse, so I didn’t really push it. I was extremely patient with her because I really liked her a lot. This went on for about a month all through January. During this time too, I did almost breakup with her because a friend found her hinge profile after she told me she deleted it. She said that she wasn’t active on it but her co worker would “look at the guys that liked her to get a good laugh” which I didn’t really believe, but then she deleted it immediately. (Probably should have broke up with her then and there). 

One night in February she said she was going out with her friends and I offered to meet her out with one of my friends because we did that a lot, we would all go out together. She said it was “just a girls night” I told her that was fine just text me where you and when you get home that’s all I ask. We live in the NE so we get some snow storms. There was a really bad snowstorm that night and my buddy and I were out so I texted her “hey supposed to be bad please watch the weather have fun.” That was about 9pm, I didn’t hear from her. Around 11pm, my buddy and I were out and it was really coming down so we left and I texted her again letting her know the roads were bad, I never heard from her. I was home and still awake around 1am. “Everything good are you okay?” No response. I finally fell asleep around 2am and woke up at 3:30am to a text saying “sorry I fell asleep.” I was pretty mad so I liked the message with a thumbs up. She gave some half assed response in the morning and I let myself calm down because I was frustrated. I then texted her saying “it’s okay I just would have appreciated a little communication I was worried I had no idea where you were or who you were with.” She apologized, but probably wasn’t actually sorry. I told her it was fine but I’d just appreciate a little more communication in the future. She then said “I don’t think me falling asleep warrants a speal about communication.” After we went back and forth for a while she said I don’t think this is working and broke up with me over text.

There was some communication back and forth after that. I wanted to work it out and tried. She gave me every excuse. “I can’t give you what you want, we’re not compatible” etc. I told her I didn’t think she wasn’t ready for a relationship and had asked her multiple times when we were dating if she wanted to date me and if she wanted a long term relationship. She always said yes. She offered to be friends and I said I don’t do that and I would have been really upset to see her dating someone new while we’re friends. She said she wasn’t gonna date anyone else. We didn’t talk for a few weeks and I still got her something for her birthday even though we were broken up, I left it on her car with a note. Things kinda blew up when she texted me thanking me for the gift but told me she was going to sign up for the gym I go to and I should basically cancel my membership because she didn’t want to see me there. Meanwhile her gym is 2 seconds down the road from her and this one is closer to me on my way home from work. I was fed up and blew up on her and because I was not going to be controlled or take her shit. We didn’t end on great terms, I was pretty bitter and upset about the whole situation. Also, come to find out she was back on hinge immediately (so was I but I was just trying to her off my mind, I didn’t talk to anyone and honestly I was looking to see if she was on it) and dating some new dude 2 weeks later. I ended up blocking her on all social media except her number and received this text. 

I’ve been struggling trying to get over her for the last 5 months. I finally have been focusing on myself this past month and feeling pretty good. I have been avoiding talking to anyone or dating people and just focusing on the gym and moving down south like I have planned for a while now. All my friends tell me not respond but apart of me wants to. Unfortunately, apart of me still has feelings for her, I dont know why. I just don’t want to be left on read and feel like a moron. That would really piss me off. It just makes me mad that she had me and discarded me when I was always there for her and now she’s coming back to apologize and tell me I’m right. I also don’t even know what I would say. (Also I’m still on hinge again I don’t actively use it but I saw her back on today, so I’m assuming her and her rebound are done, which is probably what prompted the text to me).

Remember that post a few weeks back about wanting to recreate Sony's magical ""Listening Mode""? You know, that thing where your music stops living inside your skull and starts floating around you like you're chilling in your favorite coffee shop?

Well... **I actually built it.** 🤯

Meet **CaféTone** \- and honestly, I'm still pinching myself that this thing actually works.

**What does it do?**

* System-wide audio processing on Android (works with Spotify, YouTube, literally everything)
* Custom DSP engine with EQ, Haas effect, reverb, and binaural magic
* Transforms that claustrophobic ""music in your brain"" feeling into spacious, ambient sound
* Perfect for coding sessions, studying, or just vibing

**The wild part:** This was my *first ever* Android app. I went from zero to shipping in a few weeks, diving deep into native C++ for audio processing and wrestling with Android's background services. Shoutout to AI for keeping me sane during debugging marathons and to [freecodecamp.com](http://freecodecamp.com) for the incredible free resources.

**Here's the thing** \- I'm making this completely free and open-source because honestly? Good audio shouldn't be locked behind paywalls. We all deserve music that doesn't feel like it's drilling into our eardrums.

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/evinjohnn/cafetone](https://github.com/evinjohnn/cafetone)

If this sounds cool to you, a GitHub star would mean the world to a small dev like me. It's literally the fuel that keeps me coding at 2 AM! 🌟

The response from this community gave me the push I needed to actually build this thing. Now I'm curious - who's brave enough to be my first beta testers?

Drop a comment if you try it out. I'm genuinely excited (and terrified) to see what you all think!

When I was 15 I ended up in a ""relationship"" with a boy who had just graduated highschool, he was 17 nearly 18, and I say ""relationship"" in quotations because he took advantage of me in multiple ways and it was a bad situation from the start. At the time I was in a really dark place and was really self destructive, there was a lot that happened because of this ""relationship"" that pushed me even further into the dark.

Of course, being 15 and emotional vulnerable, I thought it was love and he was the one. I defended him, I painted him in a positive light even when he hurt me, and I looked past the fact that without fail, every single time we hung out we had to have sex. It was all he wanted all the time.

I didn't tell my mother that I was sexually active, she had told me I couldn't have sex until I finished my first 3 months of birth control pills but of course I didn't listen, I wanted to make him happy. Everything got worse when she found a condom wrapper under the couch.

I remember her and my step dad asking me to sit on the couch with them, they wouldn't look at me, they just set the wrapper on the coffee table and asked me to explain myself. They didn't talk to me for the rest of the night.

The next day after school I tried to talk to my mom, she expressed how disappointed she was and I understood that, but then she expressed how angry she was and how in that moment she didn't love me. I sat on the kitchen floor sobbing until my step dad got home, I tried to talk to him but he dismissed me and joined mom in continuing to ignore me. That evening mom made me clean and disinfect the whole couch, and she bragged about making me do so to my cousin. She had this little carpet cleaning machine that I had to use and I spent hours cleaning that couch, if I missed a spot I had to do the whole thing again.

There was never a resolution. Eventually the tension faded, him and I broke up, life moved on. I remember how angry my mom was, I remember her telling my cousin how she made me disinfect the couch and my cousin asking if I was OK, I remember how dark and alone I felt for months, but everything just moved on.

Sex is a really complicated topic for me now because of a lot of things, but I remember all of this and it makes me want to crawl out of my skin, I feel dirty, I feel shame.

So, I am from Greece I was doing my Erasmus (study abroad for US) abroad then went to US for 2 summers to work in the state of
Maine. Money wise was great but it was a bit lonely. Just work and... well nothing else. So I decided that this year I'll stay in Greece for work. 

I saw a job listing in a small island in the Aegean. So I said why not? I am a server in a tavern. 

Now we are getting to the point. 

So I had a conversation with Nikki (44F). Among other things I asked her the accommodation situation. She said they offer accommodation and that at the beginning I'll be by myself and later I might have another roommate. I asked her again to clarify and I remember telling her that I would happily co exist with another person but not with more people. We agreed and I finally came to the island. 

When I arrived they told me that I'll be staying with another cook. I settled down and days after my arrival they brought a second girl in the house. So at the moment we are in total 3 girls in that place. I didn't say anything, I didn't complain. NOTHING. To clarify,  it's not a house with multiple rooms. It's a house with A room. It has a large area with 2 beds and then the kitchen which was big enough to bring my bed into it. Also the only door that exists is the bathroom door.

Today while working I heard Nikki and her brother Alex (42M) talking with a girl over the phone and practically hiring her as well. 

After the shift they sat me down and the rest of the servers to ask how we view work and if they should hire another person. We all know that by the days the guests will be more and more. So I told them they know better the place since it's  the first time here for the rest of us. They dropped the bomb that they are asking bc they know we need one more person and that she will be staying with us. And this will make us 4. So I told them that I understand their place but I was been told otherwise and that if they will bring another person in our house to start looking for another one as well because this exceeds my limits and that I'll be leaving.

I mind that they asked our opinion about the extra person and they didn't just say ""we already hired another server "". What kind of game is this?

Nikki seems to understand but she is upset bc I'm the oldest one here and me and her are taking the orders as well. So they know the f up big time bc they do not have the time to train a new person.

For your information there is another house that 2 guys are staying with no extra space, another house that only 1 guy is staying with no extra space (this one is more like a room and less than a house). And there is another house that another cook is staying which is a not so young lady X(67F) that she agreed to stay by herself. Also this lady is the last one that arrived here.

I felt they were pushing me to ""accept "" it. Telling me it's ONLY FOR 1 MONTH. Meanwhile I do not  stay in a room with 4 people even on vacation. WTF? 

I stood my ground and gave a deadline within the month of July telling them that if they decide to bring her in, I want to know bc I'll leave and I want to put my life in order. I want to have the time to collect my documents to reach the deadline to apply for my graduation ceremony. (Otherwise I will go to November's graduation).

When I said I'll be going Alex went angry. It didn't affect me, now I'm thinking about it, it makes me laugh. Like sorry that I have boundaries. It won't happen again if it doesn't suit you. 

Also Nikki tried to pull a bunch random excuses of why it's not ""convenient "" to go with the house with X. I agree to some of them but they all apply to us as well. Such as that X will be waking up early to go to work so she will be waking up the other waitress, replying that my roommate is also waking up early to go to work too bc she is ALSO a cook.

My roommate cook is also on the Same page as me. And Tbh I think they need her way more than than X.

One of the funny things nikki said and really made me laugh was that ""ohh you know she is old she wants to wake up very early make coffee and take a d*mp"" (she said it in a way more formal way but... hey guys language barrier). Like what? We the other 3 of us do not sh*t ? I'm trying to understand but I don't. 

Soooo, AITA for wanting to quit my job?

My husband and I have been together 7 years and honestly we’ve never been big on constantly hanging out with people. We’re just homebodies focused on our family, faith, and peace. I work full-time and also had a part-time job for my friend (28F), who I’ve known since our early 20s. We recently started living in the same state again after years apart, and since then she’s had a hard time accepting that I’m just not in a season where I’m super available.

When I moved here, I was 9 months pregnant with my third. After he was born, he was in the NICU for a month — I didn’t even get to hold him until he was 3 weeks old. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever gone through. On top of that, I was raising my other two toddlers, taking care of an elderly family member in our home, and managing the household. I don’t have the capacity to entertain, go out all the time, or be on the phone constantly — and that’s okay.

She’s single, no kids, very social, and really needs a lot of presence in friendship. I’ve done a lot for her—put my name on her car after a DUI, supported her through a scary relationship where the guy literally pulled a gun on her (then she invited him over without telling me while I was visiting), worked for her business for free for over a year, bought her old laptop just so she wouldn’t have to spend on a new one, and even when she didn’t want to write me a rec letter, I let it slide. She also gossips a lot, which I try not to get involved in. I usually just listen and validate unless it’s something I really feel the need to speak up about.

But lately I’ve been setting boundaries. Less phone time, more present with my kids, less gossip, more intentional living.

A couple weeks ago I asked her if she wanted to do a coffee shop work/study day. She always says she doesn’t see me so I tried. That morning I texted her at 7am with a place I liked. She texted back around 10 saying yes. I told her I needed to be home by 2 and that I had my phone on DND but was checking messages. She got upset that I didn’t let her know ahead of time. Said I was rude. Told me I made her feel like she didn’t matter because I have a husband and kids. We were literally texting the whole time.

She never confirmed she was coming but drove to my house, sat in her car for 30 minutes without telling me, then rang the doorbell. I had no idea she was out there. We went in the backyard to talk and it started off calm. I’m not reactive. I actually get very calm in tense situations. She was clearly expecting me to match her energy, but I just stayed grounded. Toward the end she got emotional and raised her voice. She asked me “where do I fit in your life if your husband and kids come first?” and I told her “nowhere in that context—they are my life.” That’s when she lost it.

I told her she had to go because she was yelling and I don’t allow that energy around my kids. I grew up around yelling and I’m not doing that to them. As she left she demanded the laptop back that I had bought from her (that I only used for work). We haven’t spoken since. She ended the friendship that day and honestly, I’m at peace.

So, AITA for being honest about where she fits in my life and protecting my peace, even if that meant letting go of the friendship?

⸻

TL;DR:
Friend got mad I had my phone on DND even though we were texting. Drove to my house, didn’t tell me she was outside, then rang the doorbell. Got emotional when I said my husband and kids come first. Ended the friendship by demanding a laptop I bought from her. AITA?

I know it is not easy and I also looked into it deeply. But do you think I could find a graphic design job there? Or maybe after we get used to the city, can I help small local businesses with design work?

30/F 5'3"" 200 lbs

300 mg gabapentin 
20 vyvanse

I started feeling like I was going to be sick to my stomach,  both vomiting and diarrhea but then over the course of 10 minutes I went from fine to starting to feel my entire body vibrate and tingle. With the vibrating feeling, it took my breathe away and made it seem like everything was clenching? I couldn't move my hands, arms or legs and my hands were like... Contracting shut? There wasn't a lot of shaking but I couldn't control my body. I don't think I passed out, I was fairly with it mentally. 

I told my husband to call 911 at the beginning before I lost control of my body, which lasted about 5 or 10 minutes. Paramedics tried saying it was probably anxiety... Had my parents take me to the ER since my right side still felt weak.

Got to the ER and had some labs drawn. I was very surprised my urine was coffee colored brown. I have definitely been drinking water recently and my urine was normal colored earlier in the day. 

ER exam was fairly basic. 

CBC was mostly fine except WBC was raised to 11.4 from 7.2 a month ago and mildly elevated absolute neutrophils.

CK, MG, Phosphorus , Lipase were normal. 

CMP was fairly normal for me. 

UA was abnormal. Almost everything flagged but almost 100% sure it was due to color interference. Calcium oxalate, rare(0-2) RBC and WBC seen on microscope.

Doctor prescribed an antibiotic.

Probably irrelevant but my right big toe and top of foot have been tingling for about 2 weeks now. Same side as my weak arm. 

Maybe relevant background; I had intense face pain that might be trigeminal neuralgia(reason for the gabapentin) and a clean MRI 2 years ago. Also have aura only migraines. 

This happened last night around 9 pm. I'll be calling my PCP for an appointment in the morning but I'm wondering what to ask about. Should I make an appointment with a neurologist? Idk what could have happened. Is this just a wild reaction to a bladder infection?

Thank you

But my go-to is still the Toddy maker. It's simple, reliable, and produces smooth, low-acid cold brew every time.

If you're new to cold brew or looking to up your game, here's how to use a Toddy maker for perfect cold brew coffee:

1. Start with coarse ground coffee. You'll need about 12 ounces for a full batch.

2. Put the stopper in the bottom of the Toddy and wet the filter. Place the filter inside the brewing container.

3. Add 6 cups of cold water to the container, then gently add your coffee grounds.

4. Slowly pour another 6 cups of water over the grounds, making sure all the coffee gets wet.

5. Don't stir! Just gently press down any floating grounds with the back of a spoon.

6. Let it steep for 12-24 hours at room temperature. Longer steeping = stronger brew.

7. When ready, remove the stopper and let the coffee drain into the glass carafe.

8. Store your cold brew concentrate in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

To serve, mix the concentrate with water or milk to taste. I usually do a 1:1 ratio, but you can adjust based on how strong you like it.

The Toddy method produces a smooth, less acidic brew that's perfect for iced coffee drinks. It's also super versatile - you can use it for hot coffee too by adding hot water to the concentrate.

If you're in the market for a cold brew maker, I highly recommend checking out the selection at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They've got a great range of options, including the Toddy and other top brands.

One thing I love about cold brew is how easy it is to customize. You can experiment with different roasts, grind sizes, and steeping times to find your perfect brew. And once you've got your concentrate, the possibilities are endless. Try it in smoothies, cocktails, or even baking recipes.

Making cold brew at home saves me a ton of money compared to buying it at coffee shops. Plus, I always have a batch ready in my fridge for those mornings when I need a quick caffeine fix.

If you're serious about your iced coffee, investing in a good cold brew maker is definitely worth it. The Toddy is my personal favorite, but there are lots of great options out there. You can browse some of the best iced coffee makers at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers to find one that fits your needs and budget.

Remember, the key to great cold brew is patience. It takes time, but the smooth, rich result is totally worth the wait. Happy brewing!",1,1751852716.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

He grew 7 inches and gained 20lbs in one year. 😩 Granted, he has always been a good eater. Never missed a meal no matter what. And he has always been a big boy. Always been 99th percentile for height and weight. Doctor thinks that he may have gained all the weight since having my second baby. Nonetheless, I feel like I'm letting him down by letting him gain the weight of the past year. We avoid processed snacks and stick to our fresh veggies and fruits. We are limiting how much we eat outside. No juices. We even cut down to 1% milk but he loves his ""coffee"". Recently, I have quit my job to be at home with my babies and I try to keep him active as possible. Anyone have any extra tips to possibly stabilizing his weight? I can't stop his height but at least I can limit how much he gains.

Can't do much.,"Yes I write long e-mail, it is because you wont talk to me so I have to fit everything in one, as I couldn't tell you in small sections, or at a coffee table in London, or over mic. So I have to write it here. It is all I can do to free my mind of sadness.

In 2016, you shouldn't have reached out to me and told me you were looking at universities in the UK and wanted to hang out with me while here, because all that did was open up an old wound and gave me hope.

I was able to block you out of my mind as best I could when we stopped talking as teens, but you brought it all back again.. I always intended to stay your friend forever, even when we were teens. I never intended to ever be gone in the teen days. I had no intention in my mind to ever go, but it got difficult and I kept thinking you liked that guy you were always hanging out with in your town more, so because of my poor self worth in my self, I had to run away.

You told me the apartment across from yours was vacant and made a joke of me moving in as neighbors, or looking at house prices near me, or visiting my flat, or said we could have a Christmas together or France or go to America or York, around England or cook for me and see stars out your flat window or pick you up in London.

I know you didn't mean to get my hopes up, but it did. Not angry at you, in that moment you probably just felt relaxed with me to suggest that. But it did make my heart race that we'd be real friends to travel to see twice a year in summer and winter.

Then all of a sudden something changed in you. Who knows what. Someone attacked you, someone filled your head with stories, you read something somewhere, but you all of a sudden started to lose trust in me, even though I have sent every HD photo of me with my bad pores and hiding nothing, told you everywhere I go, showed you photos of my friends, made a video of the outside of my house with street signs, told you embaressing stuff about me, gave you my number. All. You didn't send much back of you, but I never demanded it. I would have done all even send a scan of my passport if you asked, I really have nothing to hide.

And all of a sudden claimed I was suspicious. I don't know why you changed. I will never know. But that is not the person that I knew. It is normal for a friend to be excited to cry their eyes out at a trainstation of happiness to see their old pal, especially one who made hints of seeing each other for years.

Being excited for a friend isn't suspicious or offering to pay a ticket, as my Autism support worker said I would need to buy two tickets always anyway, because I am bad at indapendant skills, so I'd have to pay a support worker to go with me on travels, or a friend, so not a problem to me. But you twist it at some lonely pervert giving a girl money because he wants sex, or something, which doesn't fit with any personality I've ever displayed, so it came out of nowhere. And you are the one who love bombed me with hand made craft gifts in the mail as kids, so you got it the other way around!  And I'm a do-er, not a dreamer, I put actual practical steps towards dreams so they become reality, which spooked you out.

Or maybe because of your body tone, you thought maybe I would be expecting something else or PTSD from your past and you thought I'd judge and bully you, well that's not true. Well I get PTSD too, I think people think I am ugly when they act funny around me, so I feel it too.

Or maybe I freaked you out when I said stuff like ""good morning cutie"", well I thought when people wake up they are sweaty, morning breath and bags under eyes and I thought I would say something nice to give you a positive boost to your day to make you feel good.

At the end of the day, yes there is lots of evil people in this world who will shower someone with affection and want to gain control of someone else and want to use them for sex, but I would never in a million years think you would think that about me as I always was relaxed around you like you were the one person I could run to when everyone else is paranoid and me and you could be in our own bubble and laugh at the chaos outside and be trustful and understanding of each other. Like when you said the Tesco guy wanted to carry your shopping upstairs and you said ""No thank you"" and he said ""I am not that old!"" You told me and we both laughed because we had a joint understanding. We used to and I don't know why it is gone.

Well hope it is all cleared up now and this time I will try again to pretend you don't exist, which is difficult because you meant a great deal to me and taught me what happiness feels like, and  gave me something to wake up for and come home after work for both as a teen and during Covid.

I’m a 20-year-old, working in a routine job, and super serious about becoming a UX designer by January 2026. I’m starting the Google UX Design course on YouTube this week (aiming for 1–2 videos/day) and learning Figma to build a portfolio with 2–3 projects. My goal is to land an entry-level UX job or internship by the new year.

I’m looking for an accountability partner to keep me on track with my 10–15 hours/week study plan (around 2 hours/day). I sometimes feel lonely and deal with mental fog, so having someone to check in with would be huge. Ideally, you’re also learning UX (or tech) and are serious about your goals.

I usually just do one big one in the morning lol after my protein shake and coffee so it’s not normal for me to need to do a second one but sometimes I just need to and I’m fine. 2hrs later I’d been grocery shopping got home and out of nowhere felt the urge to go and I’m like I need to go, I go to toilet but nothing would come out just a bit of gas, I felt a bit nauseous but I think it was just anxiety cause I was panicking.

Then for the rest of the night just this heavy feeling in my lower stomach like nowhere near mid stomach, lower just heavy sore bloated and like achy right near my bum hole like a pressure feeling. I hasn’t eaten a lot yesterday so I made myself just a wrap with avocado and Vegemite and that seemed to help the nausea cause I think I was so hungry but also didn’t feel hungry it was weird.

Thismorning wake up fine have my protein smoothie and coffee then go to do poo, definitely now a bit constipated hard to come out and very solid little plops but got some out. Then 40 mins later felt I needed to go again and again solid little plops but now with like liquid bits along the solid bits like not d* whatsoever just solid then this watery bits along with it. Then I had a hot ginger and tumeric tea and my greens juice and I was sitting down and I went to have wind and literally shat myself lol ahahah it was such a small amount of liquidity watery almost mucus and then went to the toilet and just a bit of broken up bits and liquid mucus like stuff but nothing more wants to come out I’m done pushing.

I don’t really feel that nauseous if I don’t think about it just like bloated but empty at the same time like hungry. Tracking back to try and think of other solutions than the easiest to go to having something. Saturday morning I had to get up at 5am to go to my boyfriends sport game and I was going cause I’m 21 still on my L’s lol and it was an hour there an hour back so good hours. I got up had my protein smoothie and coffee got ready and then went to go to toilet but we had to leave in 15mins and idk why I get stressed when I’m needing to leave soon and can’t poo ahahah, so I barley got any out. Then the drive omg, I had 5 BAD panic attacks driving almost stopped the car on a main road I just hadn’t been exposed to roads like that so anxiety was at an all time high and just felt OFF for the whole day and I didn’t eat lots but when I did eat I ate half a tub of icecream and then avocado feta on focaccia with heaps of chilli on it and I don’t cope too well with spice on my gut. That night I had bad lower bowel pain and near my bum hole but I’m like it’s the chilli. I’ve also been really stressed cause I’m transitioning from job to job and have been waiting for my new contract and all this stuff. Does this sound like it’s something or has this happened to anyone else and I’m fine? I honestly recon I’m a bit backed up from Saturday morning then everything that happened on Saturday and what I ate just worsened the situation.

Because nothing throws the Governing Body into a tizzy faster than an avalanche of truthful online roasts they can't control.

Here’s your mission, should you choose to accept it (and you will, because you're all brilliant, gorgeous rebels):

**Step 1: Create two fresh Gmail pseudonyms.** Think: [jwTruthSeeker69@gmail.com]() or [WatchtowerCrashDummy@gmail.com]() \- *bonus points for creativity.*

**Step 2: Aim your wrath at a minimum of 20 Kingdom Halls near you.** You’re a bit rusty on creative venom? No worries. ~~ChatGPT~~ is your trusty sidekick. Just prompt it to produce scathingly funny, utterly truthful one-star reviews. Trust me, it'll do the heavy lifting with gleeful ease.

**Step 3: Fire away your reviews, each with a sprinkle of truth that might just penetrate the deep cognitive fog of your average PIMI.** If just one person pauses and thinks, ""Wait, they're kinda right..."" then our work here is done.

Earlier today, one brave soul dropped a deliciously scorching review for their local Swiss Hall. We swarmed in, dropping supportive likes and added chaos; beautiful apostate teamwork at its finest!

This isn't petty revenge; it's a public service dipped in a strong vat or irreverent sarcasm and dark humor. With enough unified firepower, the Organization's PR team will be spinning faster than Tony Morris's liquor store trips.

**I personally dropped forty of these gems in about ten minutes** while sipping coffee, which was efficient apostasy at its peak, I must say. ***Need an example?*** *Here was my first:* ***""A beacon of hope if your idea of light is a flickering exit sign guiding you straight into spiritual bankruptcy.""*** 

**So, who's in?** Ready to make the Watchtower sweat bullets trying to scrub the internet clean? Let's ensure the Governing Body’s ""positive reviews"" team is utterly overwhelmed and hilariously outmatched.

Let the sunlight remind you that no matter what happened yesterday, today is filled with opportunity. Take a deep breath, feel the present moment, and be grateful for it. Life isn't always easy, but there's always something to be thankful for—a kind word, a quiet morning, a new idea, or even a simple cup of coffee.

Start your day with positivity. Set one small goal. Smile at someone. Be kind to yourself. Even the smallest steps forward count.

1lthj0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1lthj0h/fell_for_an_office_situationship/,Fell for an office situationship,"I (25F) started a new job recently. There I met this guy (23M) who I immediately clicked with. But I didn’t think much of it because we both have partners (mine is a complicated situation) and he was going to leave for grad school in three weeks. He was a little shy around me but very sweet. And he made intense eye contact with me. I couldn’t help but reciprocate.

Over the next two weeks, I began to realize how similar we were and that really attracted me to him. He is also incredibly intelligent, definitely the smartest guy I’ve ever met. I’m highly intelligent too and it’s rare for me to come across someone who can stimulate me intellectually. 
I began to feel a lot of the physical love symptoms—food tasted disgusting and I could barely sleep. He was all I could think about.

After two weeks, our boss promoted me to the position he was leaving behind, and asked him to train me. Things started to heat up a bit. There was palpable sexual tension between us. I noticed my very presence aroused him. He would discreetly try to hide himself, ofc, but I couldn’t help but pick up on it. Simultaneously he began emotionally withdrawing, not wanting to converse with me, and actively avoiding training me. Then going out of his way to be obnoxiously friendly with the other girls in the office. I was really hurt by this, especially because I only had one week to learn his job (and try to get to know him).

Two nights before his last day, the thought of him leaving terrified me. I knew I would probably never meet this guy again and I wanted so badly to be in his life. Which I know sounds crazy but I’ve never met anyone like him.

I decided to write him a brief letter. Nothing sappy, just confessing that I admire him and his intelligence, etc. I also asked if he would like to go out for coffee before he goes to grad school. I scribbled out my phone number at the bottom and spritzed my signature perfume on it. I cried writing it. It felt like a breakup even though we were never together.

I gave it to him as he was leaving the office on his last day. 

He never reached out, not even to turn me down, which really crushed me. I understand he’s most likely emotionally unavailable but it still hurts to have been ghosted completely. I also know that he has a girlfriend but I could tell he was feeling the same things. It was impossible not to notice how much I attracted him.

The following week I texted him a work question and he didn’t respond to that at all. 

I know that I should leave him alone. He’s obviously going through a lot. But I also desperately want to tell him how I feel. I know it’s not a good idea. But I’ve never felt like this about anybody before and I don’t want to lose him forever. I’ve thought about making a short playlist but idk if that’s a good idea.",1,1751851270.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

We were vibing—she was funny, sharp, gorgeous—and then midway through coffee, she said, *“It’s hard not to feel like I’m a character in your content.”*

I froze. Not in a bad way. Just… yeah, it hit.

I’ve been making solo content for a few years—mostly voice-heavy, personal, meant to feel intimate. Nothing X-rated, but a lot of women follow it, and some feel a kind of connection to the version of me they hear. On dates, that gets a bit complicated.

Some  already know my voice. Some quote things back to me. One told me she falls asleep to me every night, which was flattering and mildly terrifying. But it messes with my head. I’m never sure if they’re into *me*, or this curated version of me they’ve imagined. And it makes me second-guess myself the whole time.

**What I’m stuck on:** I never know *when* to disclose what I do.  
If I bring it up early, it can throw off the whole vibe. If I wait too long, it feels like I’m hiding something. Either way, I end up feeling performative or guilty, and neither one’s good for connection.

Would love some perspective. Just trying to have something genuine—and not feel like I’m always being watched from the outside.",1,1751851250.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

To say that the last 48 hours have been a emotional rollercoaster, would be quite an understatement. For those of you just joining us, this is the linked post. 

In short, I was brought to coin collecting/silver stacking purely by happenstance. The subs came up a few times in my feed, and before I knew  what was happening, it became a hobby for both myself and my 12 year old son Noah. We had managed to save nearly $1300 in silver coins, bars, and rounds. Over the Holiday Weekend, we had some friends and family over to celebrate. Everyone had a good time, we lit fireworks, and called it a night. The following day, while going for some coffee, I discovered that my alternator had failed in my vehicle. I discussed it with Noah, and he agreed that we could sell some sliver to pay for the repair. (2 months prior, I had to start paying for “home health” for my mother’s care. Noah is a smart boy, and I know, that he knew, that money was/is tight) Again, you can probably see where this is going, but when we went to take inventory of the silver, someone had helped themselves to all of it. I posted that story in this sub earlier today, more so as a cationary tale than anything else. 

I took recomendations from eveyone in both subs. (r/silverbugs, r/coins) I filed a police report, and contacted any local pawn shops/coin shops to make them aware. Lastly, I have reached out to almost every guest that was at the party, thus far I have nothing incriminating unfortunately. 

Since I made that post, the support, friendship, and love that has been sent my way, has broken me down into tears more than once. At one point today, Noah and I were at the kitchen counter, I was reading the messages aloud to him; and we were both crying. When I asked Noah why he was crying, he said “Dad, I was crying because you were crying!” and we both had a pretty good laugh at that. 

To list everyone that I’ve spoken to, would take half a day, and make for a very long post. Yes…we have recieved that much goodwill from the members of both of these subs. (r/coins, r/silverbugs) Soon, people started offering to send us silver rounds; and coins free of charge. Several people have messaged us, and offered to send us “starter coins” to get our silver coin colection stacking again! I distinctly remember seeing Noah do an impressive “happy dance” as I showed him some pics of silver rounds coming our way. The amount of support sent to us, was nothing short of amazing. In that moment I realized that these subs, are a marked difference between some of the hate and animosity that is blasted elsewhere on Reddit. 

I tried to be as direct and up front as possible with these folks wheh I recieved a message. I still needed an alternator, and my original plan was to cash in some silver in order to cover the cost of the parts, then do the work myself. It is very possible that I would have to sell some of this gifted silver, in order to continue on my mission and get the car fixed. If I could get the part asap, I could limit how much work I missed, and I have two PTO days I can use. It still didn’t sit well with me, so I wanted to make it known, as clearly as possible, to anyone sending us a gift, some may be sold, I did not want to hurt or anger anyone in this. That was quickly glossed over by everyone I spoke to, who still insisted on sending the silver. Along with this, several people reached out with monetary donations towards my alternator, and I can gratefully sqy that my alternator has been paid for. 

I’ll be really honest with you guys, and let you know that we haven’t had the greatest couple of years. Given the circumstances, both Noah and Emma have aclimated well after the loss of their mother. I, on that other hand, have felt like I have never been able to put my broken pieces back together. For the first time, in a long time, today I have felt like things are going my way…that everything was clicking into place. 

If I had a counter going, I would be willing to wager that I have said “thank you” around 5000  times today, because I really don’t know what else to say. This happened at a time, when I really wasn’t holding out much hope for humanity…as lately I could only see the ugly in it. Members of both of these subs, have completely changed my perspective on this : faith in humanity restored. So once again, from the bottom of both ouf our hearts, Noah and I are beaming with gratitude today as we say “Thank You.”
