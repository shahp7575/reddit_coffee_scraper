1iazgcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1iazgcu/asking_ai_what_would_it_be_like_the_roles_of/,"Asking AI what would it be like the roles of teachers and students were reversed, the results are hilarious","If middle school students were the teachers and their teachers became the students, it would be a hilarious, chaotic, and surprisingly enlightening role reversal! Here‚Äôs what this upside-down world might look like:

---

### **1. Classroom Dynamics:**
- **Student-Teachers:** Middle schoolers would take over lesson planning, grading, and classroom management. Expect lessons on TikTok trends, video game strategies, and memes.
- **Teacher-Students:** The adults would sit at tiny desks, trying to follow along while secretly judging the ""teaching"" methods.

---

### **2. Curriculum Changes:**
- **New Subjects:** The curriculum would include classes like *Fortnite Physics*, *Meme History*, and *Advanced Snack Science*.
- **Homework:** Assignments might involve creating viral TikTok videos, designing the ultimate gaming setup, or writing essays on why recess should be longer.

---

### **3. Classroom Management:**
- **Discipline:** Student-teachers would struggle to maintain order, resorting to creative punishments like making teacher-students write ""I will not talk during class"" 100 times or sit in the ""thinking corner.""
- **Recess:** Teacher-students would beg for extra recess, while student-teachers would debate whether to allow it.

---

### **4. Parent-Teacher Conferences:**
- **Role Reversal:** Parents would meet with 12-year-old ""teachers"" to discuss their child‚Äôs (the actual teacher‚Äôs) performance. Awkward moments would abound.
- **Feedback:** Student-teachers might say things like, ""Your child is very bright but spends too much time doodling in their notebook.""

---

### **5. School Events:**
- **Field Trips:** Student-teachers would plan trips to amusement parks, gaming conventions, or the local mall.
- **School Dances:** Teacher-students would awkwardly attempt to dance to the latest trends, while student-teachers judge them from the sidelines.

---

### **6. Teacher Lounge:**
- **Student-Teachers:** They‚Äôd use the lounge to snack, gossip, and complain about how ""lazy"" their teacher-students are.
- **Teacher-Students:** They‚Äôd sneak in to steal coffee and vent about how unfair the grading system is.

---

### **7. Life Lessons:**
- **Empathy:** Student-teachers might gain a new appreciation for how hard it is to manage a classroom and keep everyone engaged.
- **Humility:** Teacher-students would experience the frustration of being misunderstood or underestimated, just like their students often feel.

---

### **8. Unexpected Outcomes:**
- **Innovation:** Middle schoolers might bring fresh, creative ideas to teaching, like using video games to teach math or social media to teach communication skills.
- **Chaos:** Without the experience or authority of adult teachers, the school might descend into hilarious anarchy.

---

### **9. Long-Term Impact:**
- **Mutual Understanding:** Both students and teachers might develop a deeper understanding of each other‚Äôs challenges and perspectives.
- **Policy Changes:** The experiment could lead to real changes in education, like more student input in curriculum design or more creative teaching methods.

---

### **Conclusion:**
While this role reversal would likely be chaotic and short-lived, it could also be a fun and eye-opening experience for everyone involved. It might even lead to a greater appreciation for the hard work that both students and teachers put into the school day. Who knows? Maybe middle schoolers would discover a hidden talent for teaching‚Äîor at least make recess mandatory for all ages! üçéüéÆ‚ú®",1,1737951014.0,Teachers,0,1.0,False

I couldn't resist and got it. Mostly because there seems to be a lot of newer capsules that the OL doesn't get--Blue Bottle etc. And, I had a Keurig for regular coffee that recently died (I swear Keurigs have the lifespan of fruit flies). I thought the VL ""Coffee"" mode would suffice here.

So now I have an OL Creatista and VL Creatista. Which is pretty redundant. I kind of don't like ""Coffee"" mode. It seems to basically make a quadruple espresso with an inch thick layer of crema. I end up getting a coffee mustache trying to drink it. Not bad--but a very strange drink. The espresso is just as good as the OL.

My biggest problem with the VL Creatista is how the machine opens. I always feel like I'm going to break it when I turn the lock to open the lid. As opposed to the smooth action of the OL. Also, the lack of screen on the VL is sort of confusing--at the start, trying to decipher what the single blinking light meant was kind of weird.

  
Anyway--a good machine, but I still largely drink OL capsules unless I truly want to get jacked on VL's ""Coffee"" mode. Anyone else have both machines?",1,1737950798.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

1iaz8tz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMentalHealth/comments/1iaz8tz/have_you_ever_thought_about_what_it_would_be_like/,Have you ever thought about what it would be like to be white (or anyone with white skin and straight or curly-straight hair)?,"How would your mornings go?

You would wake up after a good night's sleep and roll out of bed, hop into the shower, let your hair get wet, the lukewarm water would be comfortable on your skin. You do the morning routine and get dressed as you let the hair dry naturally or use a few minutes of the blow dryer before getting dressed. You have a cup of coffee or whatever drink you prefer with breakfast, and you eventually go out into the world among a majority of people just like you or at least similar. They might say hello, might not, but you don't cause any suspicion in the neighborhood because you are white like just about everybody else there.

If you see a non-white, you might be suspicious of them. Most people like them are not able to afford your neighborhood. In fact, you got out of the low income non-white part of the city as soon as you made enough money to leave. People like them rarely even attend your church, and if they do, they aren't very well accepted with that hair and those ill-fitting clothes and that culture. 

Your mom and dad taught you well enough, and part of that was keeping your distance from ""those people."" You won't ever need them in your life because whites take care of other whites, have the knowledge and strength to take advantage of every aspect of life and all other races if necessary. It's not your fault that no one wants them. Your life matters. Don't waste time pretending theirs does.

How about your afternoon?

Ahhh, lunchtime. The boss likes you and lets you take an hour because he trusts you to bring him back some food. He doesn't dare let one of those blacks do it. He says they can't do anything without someone looking over their shoulder with a whip in one hand, time clock on the other, and they sure better not take more than thirty minutes because give them and inch, they'll take a mile. That's what your boss always says.

The evening goes great. But then you come back home just to find out that the suspicious person you saw that morning was an old black lady moving in next door. You already feel sorry for her, but then you don't really feel much at all because her bad luck of the draw wasn't your fault. You also know she's going to be closely monitored by the neighbors and authorities. She'll be walking around with eyes on her back, that's for sure.

Life is good to you though. Another evening, glad to be white. It's more knowledge, more friendship, more activities, more opportunities to do and see and go wherever you want without question. Your parents taught you to never to settle for less, that's why being born white has been so good. At least you've got five-minute hair and a huge load of people to blend in with. 

Now, you'll go to bed and good another good night's sleep. Life is far from perfect, but at least you're white.

I've been dealing with some light urinary incontinence, mostly just unable to tell how much i need to go, unable to empty all the way, and feeling the constant need to go sometimes. I have had urinary accidents probably once a month for awhile now, although sometimes it flares up and it's a couple times a week then nothing for awhile. 
Mostly just my bladder giving out after holding it, even if it's only been 45 minutes of holding. Sometimes i can hold it for 2 hours or so since i can't always get to a  bathroom right away but that usually leaves to close calls as well

I have had a few bowel accidents but they're rare, maybe once a year or so. I have close calls maybe once a month though, which i am pretty sure isn't normal

I don't drink coffee anymore and increased fiber a lot, and don't drink soda at all. I lift weights twice a week and do heavy cardio twice a week. I am in pretty decent shape and eat mostly cleanly 

I do have a few questions
1. Why on days when i'm super gassy do i have a stronger urge to go? On days like that it's much more often and i feel much more pressure. I can't tell if i have to poop or not usually either 
2. I usually wear pull-ups when my symptoms are worse or if i go anywhere where i can't get to a  bathroom within a reasonable amount of time. They work pretty well but does that make it easier for my bladder to ' let go' if i'm wearing them? 
3. Are my yearly or so bowel accidents enough to be worried about or is that somewhat normal? I come close about once a month and it's usually a full voiding when i can't make it 
4. At night i notice more urge to go, and generally as the day goes on. At night i get more bladder and bowel pressure, but it's hard to release fully sometimes and even when i do the urge comes back quick. I wake up most nights to pee once, is waking up once a night normal? 
5. More on question 4, but is wearing pull-ups acceptable for this? I wear them at night so i can use them and not get up every 15 minutes to pee  and if i wake up in the middle of night i can use them and go right back to sleepy 
I am seeing a urologist in two weeks but looking to see if the IC community had any answers. It's driving me a little crazy and i've been having a hard time deciding to wear protection since it's so uncommon for me to have an accident

1iaz7u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1iaz7u3/escalating_bite_history_and_senior_owners/,Escalating bite history and senior owners,"Hey all,


Maybe just a long(!) vent, but also asking for some thoughts from anyone who may have navigated a similar predicament. Key considerations are escalating bite history and senior owners, one of whom is the sole full-time caretaker for the other. 


They are family who have a ~5 year old rescue (some sort of spaniel/poodle-ish supermutt) who was adopted at age 2 with an unknown history. For the first 3-4 years they lived in a standalone home in a senior community where he didn't seem to have any issues. Last year, for several reasons, they decided to move closer to us and are now renting an apartment and will need to remain in such a setting for the foreseeable future.


Since moving here the dog has starting whining/barking/lunging frequently and intensely at deliverymen and pedestrians by their unit and has bitten 3 people with escalating severity: first it was a nip (an acquaintance they ran into at a coffee shop), then a straight bite of their neighbor's thigh that did not break skin but did rip clothing, then most recently a bite that broke skin at the shin/ankle (there was blood) and ripped pants on an EMT who was responding to a call in their building. He reached over the dog to hold the elevator door for his team as the dog and owner were trying to get out. The response team took the owner's information and indicated it would be reported since it happened on duty; the owner also notified their building management (who do not seem concerned about it, but to my knowledge are not aware that the dog has previously also bitten a resident).


They have owned several dogs but none had significant training (and none formal/professional, to my knowledge). Their vet recommended one trainer when called about the last incident, but the cost and time commitment would be challenging for them to manage on top of caregiving responsibilities, nor do they want to ""send him away"" to a facility for intensive training. They are considering an online course and distracting the dog with treats (dog is already very overweight).


After bite #2 they raised the possibility of getting a muzzle but that was several months ago and still has not happened, as they ""don't want people to think [dog] is mean."" Dog is also already harness averse and owner has to chase him around the apartment to get him to wear it, so I am concerned that the dog will also be muzzle averse and may resort to biting his owner(s) as well if the muzzle is not properly (postively) introduced. 


Owner is also not keen on trying anti-anxiety medications but would maybe be open to CBD. I also suggested visually blocking the dog-level view from their apartment to avoid triggers from pedestrians and deliverymen and keep him below threshold more, but at the end of the day they will still be running into people in the hallway, elevator, and lobby and I think perhaps dog just isn't built for an apartment environment. 


Obviously I have concerns for the risks this poses to the owners (what if dog bites them, what if dog bites responders trying to help *them*, what if they are injured trying to hold dog back from lunging/biting and it impacts care for other owner, what if they get evicted or sued, etc.), but I am also concerned that this is creating an increasingly negative situation for the dog: he is anxious (whining, barking, licking his paws incessantly) and very out of shape. They say he does fine at the dog park but that isn't a substitute for regular walks and mentally engaging play/training. Owners claim he has done okay with other people and dogs in their apartment itself  but when we are there he seems to be simmering a little -- he tolerates us because we were let in by his owners but has a lot of whale eye, rigid posturing, and little nervous wags.


Given proper exercise, training, and maybe medication I think he would probably do well with someone in a house where he won't have so many unexpected people popping up, but they are reluctant to consider relinquishing him. The cop present at the most recent bite warned them that if they can't control him that ""some people"" might force the issue of BE, so they are also weighing that (perhaps because it would be emotionally easier for them than wondering if he made it okay elsewhere).


The likelihood that another level 3 or 4 bite could be on the horizon seems pretty high if they continue as they have been. With a L3+ bite already, would he even still be a likely candidate for adoption if they did give him up? Could they even safely introduce a muzzle in a time frame that makes sense, considering there is no avoiding the hallway/elevator for bathroom breaks, etc.? I am guessing no if they do it themselves, but maybe if he did go elsewhere for training and were then re-introduced to the environment. But would that truly be best for him if all it does is address his ability to bite and not any of the circumstantial/environmental triggers that drive him to bite in the first place?",1,1737950352.0,reactivedogs,1,1.0,False

After post rejection last year where I was able to see her and serve the remaining days of the ministry and after all the processing and my prayers to God so far, I have decided that I will not give up on her easily..So yeah..but I always surrender it to God my personal desires for her daily..so I am practicing daily surrender to God already

I also just wanted to share that last Thursday, the ministry we both serve to posted already on their social media pages that its calling out volunteers already to serve in the ministry for this year

They also posted the volunteers sign up form and I already signed up to the team me and my crush been serving since 2022 (I started serving in the ministry and that team last 2022, and have been serving the same team since 2024). For my crush, I don't know when she have started serving in the ministry but we both in the same ministry team when I started in 2022

So yeah, that's it and I already accepted God's calling to serve once again, keep my word of honor and my commitment to her when we had our clarity talk last year. That I told her I will not leave the ministry, especially the team, if she is not interested, before she told me that she is not interested

The current vibe I have with her so far after she had rejected me last year, is just a cordial relationship. Just saying Hi, Hello, and Bye to each other. She set a clear indirect boundaries to me that she does not want to have small conversation with me (How are you? How have you been, etc). Well yeah, not sure if we see each other again soon in Feb in ministry, if anything will change in our cordial relationship dynamic, since we already have more than 2 months of space with each other when Feb already comes..

And yeah again, I just want to share that I will not give up on her easily and will not surrender to her. I will fight till the end and besides, she still does not have a boyfriend yet

Anything can happen, there is a chance with everything and her feelings might change down the road one day

Also, I will approach her like a friend does. Treat her like a friend and remove the gesture first of romantic approach and romantic intentions. Will start off first with casual conversations if I see her in person and have the opportunity to talk to her. Sonething like ""How are you"" or ""How have you been"". See how she responds and will go from there 

My end goal for the first phase is to build rapport, comfort, and her trust to me first. Before strategizing for next steps moving forward

So back in December I got hired at Peets Coffee, The interview went well and the manager called me 3 hours after the interview saying I got the job and that there was going to be 3 new hires, Me being one of them. 1 week later began my orientation with the other 2 new hires, Then afterwards the manager scheduled each of us a day for Computer training. After I finished with the computer training the manager scheduled me 1 day for Hands on training at the register, After that she would just schedule me 1 day a week for training which wasn‚Äôt very helpful, Usually they give you 3 consecutive training days. On my 3rd Hands on Training day which happened to be my last day on January 6th, I never got put on the schedule ever since. However I noticed that one of the 2 other new hires got 1 day the week after and another day the week after that one. While me and the other new hire didn‚Äôt have any days from January 13-January 26th.  Today I checked if they put the schedule for February and they did, I noticed that they put the other 2 new hires on the schedule and haven‚Äôt given me any hours again for the first week of February. I‚Äôm just very confused, Because ever since January 6th I haven‚Äôt been scheduled to work but are giving the other new hires hours.

Everyone is telling me that they‚Äôre waiting for me to quit so I don‚Äôt file for Unemployment.

I‚Äôm a 26M in an open relationship with my 25F wife, and I could really use some advice on navigating some new feelings and dynamics. Here‚Äôs the situation:

My wife and I have been in an open relationship for a while now. It started when she developed feelings for another guy and let me know. I was okay with her exploring those feelings, and over time, she‚Äôs developed a friends-with-benefits relationship with him (though he insists they‚Äôre ‚Äújust friends,‚Äù lol). She also has some sugar daddy arrangements on the side. On my end, I haven‚Äôt put much effort into exploring other connections, but my wife has made it clear that she‚Äôs open to me doing so‚Äîas long as she remains my ‚Äúnumber one,‚Äù which I completely understand and respect.

However, she sometimes struggles with the idea of me being open to exploring, even though she‚Äôs the one who initiated the open dynamic.

Recently, something unexpected happened. I was at my sister‚Äôs wedding, and her maid of honor (24F) happened to be a high school crush of mine. We had a little thing back in the day but never dated. We reconnected at the wedding, and I invited her out for coffee with me and my wife. The three of us hung out, and it went really well‚Äîmy wife really likes her, and I found myself feeling those old butterflies I hadn‚Äôt felt in years.

Now, I‚Äôm wondering how to navigate this. I‚Äôd like to reach out to her again, but I‚Äôm not sure how to approach it. Would it be awkward to ask her to hang out one-on-one? How might she respond, given that she knows I‚Äôm married and in an open relationship? I think my wife would understand if I wanted to explore this connection, but I‚Äôve never made an advance like this before, and I feel unsure about how to proceed.

For those in open relationships: How do you balance feelings and connections on all sides? How do you approach new potential relationships while keeping your primary partner‚Äôs feelings in mind? Any advice on how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated!

So first of all, I came visit Moscow to see my girlfriend who is russian. I woke up at 2am in Paris, took bus and 2 different planes to have a transfer in Turkey because of all western Europe blocked the direct way to Moscow due to war. So I arrived at 00:00, almost 24h later, in Moscow, just imagine how tired it is.
Finally I'm telling myself, I'll meet my girlfriend and hug her so much.
Arriving at the passeport checkpoint, I see almost 100 people who are just sitting and waiting with some tired face. I'm like ok well, they must wait for control security or idk... 
I arrive at the checkpoint, after 1h it's finally my turn :
photo, fingerprint etc, nothing unusual.
Then the guy, tell me to wait few minutes outside.
They need to get a document for me and check more.

Fine I go out, just in front of the check door, sitting one hour. After that, its empty, all doors are closing. Then they tell us to go at the other place, where the 100 people are waiting. And I finally understand what's happening lol. I try to speak english, no one speak except few ones and they tell me they wait since 4h.. some since 8h and more. Then I heard my name but I'm not sure with the bad quality sound and their accent. I go to see inside the office, the guy screams ""–§–†–ê–ù–¶–£–ó –ü–ê–°–ü–û–†–¢?"" and then he tell me to wait outside a bit please 1h maximum. It's a fucking hell, no wifi, tired as fuck, waiting for so long and feeling it will never end.

I ask again after 30min if they found it, they sounds tired of me I heard the boss saying ""–ì–î–ï –§–†–ê–ù–¶–£–ó –ü–ê–°–ü–û–†–¢ –ë–õ–Ø–¢–¨"" and this kinda makes me laugh tho haha, and hoping it getting faster for me.
Of course a french guy not > as a Azerba√Ødjan migrant or someone else, but it's just so easy normally : I'm french I come for 2 weeks visit someone, I have e-visa, period, it should takes 2min to check and let me go.

After 2h, it's 4am I can't take it anymore I'm screaming at these russian control agents, because these people are so slow, incompetent, they take their little food, coffee.. and every 30min between 5-10 people are calling so they can finally pass the security door. The problem, is that there are also new people from new planes which arriving. These agents don't give a fuck beeing so slow anyway : migrants will never complain a second, they want to live in this country while I'm not, so I was the only one complaining, screaming and insulting them in french (I'm not that crazy ofc not in english haha I still try to respect).

I just can't wait anymore, also no wifi because you need a russian phone number to have it. So i asked someone for I text my gf on Telegram, she was so worrying all time. I was texting her every hours kinda to tell her the situation.

All that beeing so tired after this long time and these incompetent agents, I go see other agents and any I see I fucking scream and complain, ""welcome to Russia"" I tell them, I guess thats how they treat tourists. They even kinda laugh and say ""no english no english^^"". After 5h waiting, a guy tells me after I again complain ""come with me"" and at this moment, a guy who was waiting comes to me and say ""Martin? Martin? Passeport go go"" and some other kind migrants people are telling my name and to go see this guy who was calling names to finally go pass the door and get out.

Finally, I follow the guy with 10 other people, they didn't check ANYTHING, didn't ask me any questions, all that waiting very useless so.

I passed the door, and I can finally get out of this –®–µ—Ä–µ–º–µ—Ç—å–µ–≤–æ fucking airport. Again a security bag thing scanner, the guy asked me my nationality he said ok just go no need to check I'm like ??? 

I finally go out, still no wifi and I told my girlfriend to just go home, literally 15min before that. I run to find someone with a phone, I use his connection and call her, she didn't leave the airport and we finally meet and hug so well, she was crying of stress and fatigue.

I know it's a difficult situation and no tourists are coming in Russia from western countries, but it's still possible, so wtf is this organization ?

Just a shame how they make it so slow and how they treat tourists, they don't give a fuck anyway because no one complaning. Such a very good welcoming.",0,1737949433.0,travel,10,0.15,False

I'm not sure if it's even allowed but - I need to vent to a community that will understand - and I am also seeking outside opinions and advice. 

My friend and her husband have been together for about 5 years. He is the nicest most charming man I've probably ever met. I feel guilty thinking this of him - that's how nice he is. 

In the past approx 6 months her family has accused him of being controlling/abusive. We (myself, my friend and her partner) were all discussing this shocked at how anyone could possibly think this. As a result - she has cut off her family for the most part. She said she wants to focus on raising their child and doesn't want her family involved if they're going to think that about her sons father. (I thought that was valid). 

Over the next few months - I started to pick up on certain things that just seemed off: 

They sold her car - when I asked why she said they only needed one. (They now share a vehicle). Seemed like a legitimate enough reason. 

They pulled their son out of school - the teacher suggested he may be neurodivergent and her husband was not pleased. So they pulled him out of school - she now homeschools him full time and therefore is not going to return to work (he is in kindergarten). I asked if she's serious - are you really homeschooling from k-12? What if he wants to be around other kids? She said: we discussed it and it's a no. 

Every single time I go out with her - he's with her or the son is. I didn't pay attention to this until recently when I wanted to get her alone and ask if she's really okay - and realized I haven't been alone with her in about a year. 

Every single time we go out she doesn't have money. Herself. And a car key. Her cell phone - and that is it. I always figured: she's a SAHM I'll get the coffee it's fine. Who cares. - recently I've questioned if it's because she doesn't have access to money. 

A few weeks ago I hadn't heard from her and was concerned. She finally got back to me to tell me he accidentally hit her in their sleep and she had been suffering from a really bad migraine as a result. (She said he hit her around her temple) and that's when my alarms officially went off. 

No personal car. No job. No money (that I know of or have ever seen). She also let her college dreams go once she became pregnant - he has a degree and a great job. Pays all the bills. For the record. 

Part of why her family believes he is controlling is because they asked her about bills (they all used to live together very temporarily very recently) and her response was: I don't handle any of that stuff you'll have to wait for him to come home. She essentially isn't allowed to discuss money without him. When he came home he sat at the table with her family - and she retreated to her bedroom with their son and closed the door. She is not involved in monetary decisions. I believe this is when the alarms went off for her family. 

I find myself looking back over the years and feeling bamboozled. I feel like a fool not noticing. He just seemed so nice - and we've all always hung out. While I have no concrete proof - the writing is on the wall. I do not know what to do with this information. Anytime anyone even suggests it - he gets angry; and they get permanently cut off. I don't want to further isolate her by making myself a target in her partners eyes. 

Does anyone have any advice on next steps or if you've been in a similar situation with a friend and wouldn't mind sharing? I feel like I can't say anything or I'll lose the friendship. I also feel very awkward sitting with this information. Like I should be doing more to help - but I don't know what to do. 

Thank you. ",4,1737949222.0,abusiverelationships,3,1.0,False

1iaysnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/russian/comments/1iaysnj/how_i_waited_5h_in_passeport_checkpoint_arriving/,"How I waited >5h in passeport checkpoint arriving in Moscow, as french tourist","I'll tell you how bad is the system airport if you wanna travel right now in January 2025 as a foreigner tourist in Russia.
So first of all, I came visit Moscow to see my girlfriend who is russian. I woke up at 2am in Paris, took bus and 2 different planes to have a transfer in Turkey because of all western Europe blocked the direct way to Moscow due to war. So I arrived at 00:00, almost 24h later, in Moscow, just imagine how tired it is.
Finally I'm telling myself, I'll meet my girlfriend and hug her so much.
Arriving at the passeport checkpoint, I see almost 100 people who are just sitting and waiting with some tired face. I'm like ok well, they must wait for control security or idk.. 
I arrive at the checkpoint, after 1h it's finally my turn :
photo, fingerprint etc, nothing unusual.
Then the guy, tell me to wait few minutes outside.
They need to get a document for me and check more.

Fine I go out, just in front of the check door, sitting one hour. After that, its empty, all doors are closing. Then they tell us to go at the other place, where the 100 people are waiting. And I finally understand what's happening lol. I try to speak english, no one speak except few ones and they tell me they wait since 4h.. some since 8h and more. Then I heard my name but I'm not sure with the bad quality sound and their accent. I go to see inside the office, the guy screams ""–§–†–ê–ù–¶–£–ó –ü–ê–°–ü–û–†–¢?"" and then he tell me to wait outside a bit please 1h maximum. It's a fucking hell, no wifi, tired as fuck, waiting for so long and feeling it will never end.

I ask again after 30min if they found it, they sounds tired of me I heard the boss saying ""–ì–î–ï –§–†–ê–ù–¶–£–ó –ü–ê–°–ü–û–†–¢ –ë–õ–Ø–¢–¨"" and this kinda makes me laugh tho haha, and hoping it getting faster for me.
Of course a french guy not > as a Azerba√Ødjan migrant or someone else, but it's just so easy normally : I'm french I come for 2 weeks visit someone, I have e-visa, period, it should takes 2min to check and let me go.

After 2h, it's 4am I can't take it anymore I'm screaming at these russian control agents, because these people are so slow, incompetent, they take their little food, coffee.. and every 30min between 5-10 people are calling so they can finally pass the security door. The problem, is that there are also new people from new planes which arriving. These agents don't give a fuck beeing so slow anyway : migrants will never complain a second, they want to live in this country while I'm not, so I was the only one complaining, screaming and insulting them in french (I'm not that crazy ofc not in english haha I still try to respect).

I just can't wait anymore, also no wifi because you need a russian phone number to have it. So i asked someone for I text my gf on Telegram, she was so worrying all time. I was texting her every hours kinda to tell her the situation.

All that beeing so tired after this long time and these incompetent agents, I go see other agents and any I see I fucking scream and complain, ""welcome to Russia"" I tell them, I guess thats how they treat tourists. They even kinda laugh and say ""no english no english^^"". After 5h waiting, a guy tells me after I again complain ""come with me"" and at this moment, a guy who was waiting comes to me and say ""Martin? Martin? Passeport go go"" and some other kind migrants people are telling my name and to go see this guy who was calling names to finally go pass the door and get out.

Finally, I follow the guy with 10 other people, they didn't check ANYTHING, didn't ask me any questions, all that waiting very useless so.

I passed the door, and I can finally get out of this –®–µ—Ä–µ–º–µ—Ç—å–µ–≤–æ fucking airport. Again a security bag thing scanner, the guy asked me my nationality he said ok just go no need to check I'm like ??? 

I finally go out, still no wifi and I told my girlfriend to just go home, literally 15min before that. I run to find someone with a phone, I use his connection and call her, she didn't leave the airport and we finally meet and hug so well, she was crying of stress and fatigue.

I know it's a difficult situation and no tourists are coming in Russia from western countries, but it's still possible, so wtf is this organization ?

Just a shame how they make it so slow and they don't give a fuck anyway because no one complaning. Such a very good welcoming.",3,1737949155.0,russian,8,0.59,False

1iayrda,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1iayrda/key_takeaways_from_100_baggers_by_christopher/,Key takeaways from 100 Baggers by Christopher Mayer,"1. Market Caps Below $1 Billion

Small-cap companies with market caps under $1 billion often have significant growth potential as they operate in niche or emerging markets. These stocks are less discovered, offering a chance to invest early before they scale up. Identifying businesses with innovative products or services can lead to exponential returns over time.

2. Twin Engine: Revenue Growth and High Multiples

Look for companies with strong revenue growth and high valuation multiples (PE, PB, PS), as these indicate market confidence in future growth. Businesses in high-demand sectors or disruptive industries often fit this profile. Such stocks attract premium valuations due to their potential to dominate markets or create new ones.

3. Coffee Can Portfolio: Buy Right and Sit Tight

Multibaggers require patience. Buying fundamentally strong stocks and holding them for 10+ years allows compounding to work. Ignore short-term market noise and focus on the long-term vision of the company. This strategy helps catch structural growth trends and amplifies wealth creation over time.

4. Honest Management

Trustworthy management is key to creating multibaggers. Leaders with a clear vision, ethical practices, and a focus on shareholder value drive sustainable growth. Look for companies where management has skin in the game (owning significant stakes) and a history of transparency and sound decision making.

5. Ignore the macro elements

When investing in a company with the potential for consistent revenue growth and a long-term horizon (10+ years), don‚Äôt overemphasize elections or policies. Short-term political events rarely impact fundamentally strong businesses. Instead, focus on the company‚Äôs earnings, market position, and ability to adapt over time to deliver sustained growth.

I‚Äôm an adult now and over the course of the last 4 months I‚Äôve started the healing process of the mental abuse my step mom has done to me. 

I‚Äôm going to type out the booked mark points in my life that led to this point in my life. I‚Äôm hoping to get advice, clarity, opinions anything really would be appreciated. 

  My dad met my step mom she has 3 wonderful girls that I would call my sisters. Good relationships with them. 

Age 6 she comes into my life. She really set the boundary when they bought a new house together. Within 3 weeks of her moved in. I remember playing with toys my rockem sockem toy I got for Christmas. She came into my room and said way out in left field. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you or your brother in our lives I‚Äôm marrying your dad for my daughters and that‚Äôs it.‚Äù 

Through out my childhood whenever I did something that was bad or whatever I would get screamed at by her. She would always tell me that her daughters would be successful and that I would end up being a garbage man if I never did good in school. There was a big fight between her and my dad that she hated the idea that I was in hockey and spending me and dad time doing sports. It got so overwhelming that I just stopped didn‚Äôt care for it anymore. (I played hockey well before she came into my life.) 

I‚Äôm 11 and I took a family trip to go see my grandparents across the country. I can‚Äôt remember what triggered it but I confronted her telling me about how she didn‚Äôt want me in her life in front of my family. My dad pulled me aside in the garage and wanted to know if it was true or not. I said yes he then began repeating the question 6 or 8 times before I sarcastically said no I made it all up. She turns the corner and got mad and defensive. Calling me a liar. That night my dad drove me and two of my step sisters and a cousin of mine to a movie theatre in town. When we got back she polished off two bottles of wine passed out. I turned to my dad and said if that‚Äôs not a sign of guilt idk what is. 

14 my dad and step mom get married. During it all she turns to me and comes right up to my face and points in my face says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you screw this up for me.‚Äù 

As teenager from that point I was always angry, scared and scarred from her. I hated her with a passion. But when I was an adult I didn‚Äôt care anymore. I let it all go. Because I just wanted my dad to be happy. I began to try and have a relationship with her. Trusting her. 

Fast forward to a year ago. I stayed at my dads place and I am just starting out in my career. I‚Äôm struggling with roommates, sleep daily life things. I approached her talked about my career and how I‚Äôm feel like I‚Äôm in rut. I suck and I wanted to be better she was insightful. Really thought she could be finally more accepting of me. Month later I need a place to crash I did night shift 6 hours away I asked my dad and he said of course. I just didn‚Äôt know when they told me we might be done tomorrow or in 2 days I gave him a heads up. Anyway I make it down there I walk in with my own food. The first thing I said was ‚Äúcan I help with anything.‚Äù She told me if I could take some tubs downstairs for her I did it. That night I couldn‚Äôt sleep I was up. 6 am roles around I made my father coffee he asked if I wanted to come to work with him. I said no I just want to sleep. I woke up at 11 and I over hear a conversation with my step mom and my oldest step sister. She spent 45 mins ragging on me. Digging up all the stuff that I did was wrong and my habits and almost everything. She then began talking my career and saying stuff like I‚Äôm not going to do good not gunna make it in my career choice. I was furious I was angry. I walked up the stairs as soon as the conversation was over. She had the dumbest jaw dropping look on her face she was surprise. Took my clothes didn‚Äôt say a word to her and I drove off. I tried killing myself that day. I hated who I was and wondered my I wasn‚Äôt good enough in this world. She tried everything to apologize over text. I wasn‚Äôt buying it didn‚Äôt respond. She later texted me I‚Äôll send the screenshot. I called her a c*** my step sister was very mad at me that I called her that. To the point were she hates me now. But like I ignored her I did everything to avoid talking to her without right saying stop talking to me. 3 days go by and my dad says I want you to drive out here and let‚Äôs all talk about this I tell him no it‚Äôs not up to me to make the effort to fix this. You guys know where I am and I want a 1 on 1 conversation with her without him there. Really has nothing to do with him. He didn‚Äôt like that. Anywho year has gone by my one step sister doesn‚Äôt answer my calls. My step mom has made no effort to fix it. After Christmas I called my dad told him I‚Äôm disappointed in his choice of women. If a year can go by without a real way to resolve this then I need to let go. I began to tell me dad that I don‚Äôt want to talk to him anymore no updates no banter. It‚Äôs not forever I just need to let go of what I‚Äôm carrying. Honestly for the real first time I felt a lot better in my life felt less depressed. Anyway I want to hear what you guys think of this? What should I do from here? Do I have a relationship with my dad? Or do I let go. 

(Can‚Äôt send screen shots but I‚Äôll copy and past)

Someone that's introverted and enjoys their alone time as well would also be nice. Because as much as I'd like us to have fun when we're with each other, I'd enjoy having time to myself to recharge every so often as well.

Very happy with the machine, just trying to understand it more. I would like to create a Latte recipe with a single shot.

1. 1oz volume for espressso
2. 5/10 strength to get 8g ground beans (single espresso)
3. 4oz steamed milk/foam to achieve 4:1 ratio

This post is NOT about that same guy, but a different one. So, here it goes. 

There‚Äôs a guy (we‚Äôll call him K, also 25M) who is in another one of my classes. He‚Äôs an exchange student from Germany, and he‚Äôs only here for a semester. I have class with him for Chinese history. Since the first time I met him (ironically I took his order the night before the first day of said class at the coffee place on campus), I‚Äôve thought he was cute and have been interested in him. I‚Äôve noticed him looking at me in class a few times.

For the context of this post, I have been debating going back to church. I decided to go to a local church today that I‚Äôd been to a few times before. I walked in and lo and behold, K was standing right there. He smiled and waved to me, and we chatted for a bit. I would never normally do this, but I was bold enough to ask if he wanted to sit together for the service. He said ‚Äúsure, that‚Äôs a good idea‚Äù. We sat together and chit chatted a small bit. Afterward, we went to the dining hall on campus (I drove us over there) and ate and talked for over an hour. Another girl from church joined us so it was the 3 of us talking for a while. She had to leave, so she said her goodbyes and went on her way. I thought K would leave too, but he stayed with me and talked. We left together, and he walked me back close to my car. He told me he‚Äôd see me in class and gave me a hug. I was very pleasantly surprised by that lol. 

I‚Äôm wondering if any of this means he‚Äôs interested. I know from what I‚Äôve described it sounds like he could be, but he‚Äôs also very friendly to everyone. He was stopped multiple times by different people saying hi. I‚Äôm wondering if he‚Äôs into me or if he‚Äôs just really friendly. He didn‚Äôt ask for my number or anything, but at the same time I‚Äôm seeing him again in class. Am I reading too into this? Do I have a shot here? TIA.",0,1737948263.0,dating_advice,4,0.5,False

I know I should‚Äôve been up front about not wanting to go in the first place but I was hoping she would forget about it. I struggle to outright say no to anyone because of the way my mom has always guilted and persuaded me. It‚Äôs like my brain is trained to feel guilty for saying no to anything and everything. 

The lady texted me tonight asking how I am, if getting coffee is a possibility, and that she hopes I‚Äôm having a good start to my year. The text is nicely worded and seems genuine but I‚Äôm so used to that being a mechanism of guilt tripping that it triggers me.

I don‚Äôt think this lady knows that I‚Äôm 7 months pregnant. My car is also not running at the moment. So am I overreacting if I don‚Äôt want to go? And if not, how can I communicate that without being rude?",2,1737947268.0,AmIOverreacting,17,1.0,False

2oz tequila (i used Lalo blanco)
1/4oz Agave
2 Dashes Angostura bitters
Coffe Stout float on top
Tajin rim and light sprinkle on top


I did add a barspoon of rich demerara syrup in this, been partaking in dry january and gave up (lol) so i wanted a little more sweetness to balance it out to my liking. This was a pleasant drink. the stout i used was perfect with the tequila/tajin. i think next time i make this i‚Äôll use chocolate bitters rather than angostura to give a little boost to the coffee flavor. all around a good drink and definitely recommend!

I'm looking to purchase a machine from Nespresso. I don't know anything about any of their products, and they have a lot going on all over their website, so I've resorted to reddit to get some simpler information. I'm looking for a machine that can brew both coffee and an espresso shot. I love a nice big cup of coffee every morning, but at the same time, every now and then I like to myself a frothy cappuccino or latte after dinner with a proper espresso, or make myself a little espresso shot or two to make some tiramisu. I'm looking for a good, reliable, and hopefully not-too-expensive machine so that I can keep my options open when I'm in need of some caffeine. A machine that would allow me to access both of those drink options, as opposed to me having to buy both a drip coffee machine and AND THEN also a separate machine just to make myself the odd espresso now and then.

Essential Features to Look for in Smart Kitchen Appliances for Your Home
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In today's fast-paced world, smart kitchen appliances are becoming essential for modern homes. These devices not only enhance your cooking experience but also make your kitchen more efficient and enjoyable. When considering which smart kitchen appliances to invest in, there are several key features you should keep in mind. Here‚Äôs a closer look at those essential features to streamline your cooking and make meal prep a breeze.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-kitchen-appliances  
  
### Connectivity

One of the most critical features of smart kitchen appliances is connectivity. Many devices use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to connect to your smartphone or home assistant. This connectivity allows you to control appliances remotely, monitor cooking progress, and receive alerts. You can start your oven preheating while you‚Äôre still at the grocery store or receive a notification when your food is ready. Make sure the appliances you choose offer seamless connectivity for a truly smart kitchen experience.

### User-Friendly Interfaces

Smart kitchen appliances should be easy to use. Look for devices with intuitive controls and user-friendly interfaces. Touchscreens with clear, simple menus make it easier to navigate options. Voice control is another convenient feature, enabling you to operate your appliances hands-free. This is especially beneficial when your hands are full or messy. Ensuring that you choose appliances which have straightforward operation will enhance your cooking experience significantly.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-kitchen-appliances  
  
### Energy Efficiency

Energy-efficient appliances are not only great for the environment, but they also help reduce your utility bills. Choosing smart kitchen appliances that have energy-saving features can lead to substantial long-term savings. Look for devices that come with eco-friendly settings or those that can optimize energy usage automatically based on your routines.

### Versatility

Smart kitchen appliances that offer multiple functions can save you time and space. For example, an air fryer that also bakes, grills, and roasts replaces several single-purpose devices. This versatility is especially crucial for smaller kitchens where counter and storage space are at a premium. Consider appliances that can handle various tasks to make your cooking efforts more efficient.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-kitchen-appliances  
  
### Recipe and Meal Planning Assistance

Many modern smart kitchen appliances come with recipe apps or integrated voice assistants that can guide you through meal preparation. These features can suggest recipes based on the ingredients you have at home and even adjust cooking times and settings automatically. This can save you time and reduce the stress of figuring out what to cook, making meal planning a seamless experience.

### Smart Monitoring

Smart appliances equipped with monitoring capabilities allow you to keep an eye on your cooking. For instance, smart thermometers can send alerts when your meat reaches the perfect temperature, ensuring that you don‚Äôt overcook. Additionally, some smart ovens allow you to view the cooking process through your smartphone. This kind of technology helps you achieve delicious results every time.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-kitchen-appliances  
  
### Integration with Smart Home Systems

Choosing appliances that can integrate with your existing smart home system provides added convenience. Appliances that connect to devices like Amazon Alexa or Google Home allow for voice-controlled operation and centralized control through your smart home hub. This integration enhances your kitchen‚Äôs functionality and makes meal prep seamless within the context of your everyday life.

### Safety Features

Safety should be a priority when choosing smart kitchen appliances. Look for devices that include automatic shut-off mechanisms in case of malfunction or emergencies. Features such as child locks and alerts when appliances are left on for too long can also provide peace of mind, especially in busy households. Prioritizing safety will help you enjoy the convenience of your gadgets without worry.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/smart-home-kitchen-appliances  
  
### Design and Aesthetics

Since the kitchen is often the heart of the home, choosing appliances that match your style is important. Many brands offer a range of finishes and designs to fit your kitchen‚Äôs d√©cor. Whether you prefer sleek stainless steel or a pop of color, selecting appliances that look great will enhance your kitchen‚Äôs overall appeal.

### Final Thoughts

By keeping these essential features in mind, you can make an informed decision when selecting smart kitchen appliances that enhance your cooking experience. With the right devices, you will not only save time and effort in the kitchen, but also enjoy a more connected and enjoyable cooking environment. Investing wisely in smart technology can fundamentally transform your culinary routines and elevate your home life.

There was so much going on - the dog barking to be let out, the baby screaming for attention, the wife rapid-firing appointment reminders - that I didn't have a moment to collect my thoughts until I hit the road, steering wheel in one hand and a hot coffee in the other.

As the car idled at a red light, I sighed and closed my eyes briefly. When I opened them, I swore in shock. I was already pulling into the parking garage at work.

Was I so tired that I had blanked out my entire commute? Shaking my head, I tipped my cup up to take a sip of my now-cold coffee. But the cup was empty.

My slate of morning meetings was more bearable than usual. One moment I was listening to Steve droning on about user sentiment, and the next - *blink!* \- it was time for lunch and a power nap.

Afterwards, I tried to head back to my desk, but I couldn‚Äôt find it. I pulled up the employee directory - why did they change the app design *again?* \- and found my name attached to a private office on the tenth floor. Disbelieving, I rode the elevator up and was faced with the sight of my name etched into a gold nameplate, above the word *Director*. I screwed my eyes shut, certain I'd be at my desk when I opened them again.

Instead, I found myself at home, in a living room both familiar and changed. Photos on the walls showed me and my wife with a smiling young girl.

‚ÄúDad!‚Äù a voice called. I turned to see the girl from the photos standing at the top of the stairs, beaming at me. An odd thought crossed my mind.

‚ÄúLily?‚Äù I said uncertainly.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù the girl said.

I sat down heavily on the couch. Lily had been five months old when I left in the morning! At the thought of everything I had missed - first words, first steps, first day at school - my eyes misted with tears. I closed my eyes to wipe the tears away and opened them to the grey walls of a bare apartment. My hand was still damp, but my wedding ring was gone.

That was when I finally realized how I was losing time. Knowing didn‚Äôt help, though. I still had to blink.

With a few flutters of my eyelids, I was in front of the mirror, staring at my first grey hairs.

A few more, and I was looking at a framed photo of a young woman in a flowing white dress, gazing coyly at the camera. I‚Äôm pretty sure I missed Lily‚Äôs wedding.

How do I get my lost time back? I‚Äôve been up all night, trying desperately to figure something out. And, truth be told, I‚Äôm afraid to fall asleep.

I don‚Äôt think I would wake up again.",22,1737946773.0,shortscarystories,3,1.0,False

Also, names have been changed for obvious reasons. (Before someone complains about pronouns, my partner is non binary and uses he/they pronouns.)

So‚Ä¶ long story short, me and Violet have been dating for about two years now. He's great, sweet, funny as hell, knows how to handle himself when shit gets messy, a bit obsessive but I like that. We work well. At least we did until recently when this¬†""childhood friend""¬†of theirs popped back into the picture.

Let's call her¬†""Erica.""

Apparently, Violet and Erica were super close growing up, like best friends forever kind of thing. They lost touch for years after Violet moved away when they were kids due to some very tragic circumstances. Recently though, Erica moved to our town and ran into Violet at some coffee shop. Cue all the¬†""Oh my God, it's been so long!""¬†reunions and whatnot. Which is fine. Or it was being fine until Erica started inserting herself into everything.

She's around constantly. Like not just as in¬†""let's catch up every now and then""¬†constant. More like¬†""showing up at our house randomly without asking""¬†constant. At first, it was just inconvenient. Then it got weird. The way she talks about Violet‚Ä¶ It sends chills up my back. She keeps bringing up inside jokes from when they were kids that Violet barely remembers now. Like some kind of obsessive nostalgia fest. She even referred to herself as¬†""Violet's #1 partner-in-crime.""¬†Dead serious. Looked me straight in the eyes when she said it.

Erica's always got this‚Ä¶off putting vibe whenever we're all in the same room. She insists on sitting next to Violet every time. Always staring, like just sitting there staring at him intently. Shit that sure as hell doesn't read as just¬†""platonic.""¬†Every time she does that around me and sees my reaction, she gives me this grin that's all¬†""Yeah. What are you gonna do about it?""¬†It makes my blood run cold.

Violet is sweet as hell and clearly values this renewed friendship, which is why I've tried to keep my mouth shut for now. He insists Erica is harmless and just over-excited because they're reconnecting after so long. Except now Erica's gone as far as bringing up stuff about my and Violet's relationship, it sometimes feels like she's‚Ä¶targeting me?

Last night was the last straw for me: Erica came over without asking again. She brought some old photo album she and Violet made when they were twelve or something. Fine. Kinda cute nostalgia trip. Except when Violet went to the bathroom, Erica turned to me and said outright,¬†""You know you can never replace what we had back then, right? Violet will come to his senses eventually.""

What. The. Actual. Fuck.

Needless to say, the moment Violet came back into the room, Erica was back to acting all smiles and sweet. Pretending nothing had happened. I've been stewing over it all day and finally told Violet how uncomfortable Erica makes me. Despite their friendship, Violet did hear out my side, but also said they didn't want to let go of such a long time lost friendship, but they did find what Erica said very out of line. Still, maybe I somehow gave her a bad impression? I don't know how to feel and what to do anymore, my partner's happiness is the most important thing for me.

So Reddit, AITAH here?

TL;DR: My partner reconnected with his overly attached childhood friend who constantly disrespects boundaries and seems obsessed with him. I've had it with her weird antics and want to put some space between us and her. Violet seems hesitant to do so.

This totally makes sense why I been having massive anxiety attacks. I been taking it for weeks with coffee!!!

My question is does anybody know why it's so stimulating? It feels like it calms me at first then later the anxiety sets in

What is MCT Oil and Why It Matters for Keto

MCT (Medium-Chain Triglyceride) oil is a powerful supplement derived from coconut or palm kernel oil that offers unique benefits for those following a ketogenic diet. Unlike long-chain triglycerides, MCTs are metabolized differently in the body, providing several advantages:

‚Ä¢ Rapid energy conversion
‚Ä¢ Increased ketone production
‚Ä¢ Enhanced metabolic function
‚Ä¢ Improved cognitive performance

How MCT Oil Supports Ketosis

The primary goal of the keto diet is to enter and maintain a state of ketosis, where your body burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates. MCT oil plays a crucial role in this process by:

1. Quickly converting to ketones
2. Providing instant energy
3. Supporting metabolic efficiency

1iaxz9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1iaxz9s/step_mom_ruined_me_and_my_fathers_relationship/,Step Mom ruined me and my fathers relationship.,"28 Male here. I‚Äôm an adult now and over the course of the last 4 months I‚Äôve started the healing process of the mental abuse my step mom has done to me. 

I‚Äôm going to type out the booked mark points in my life that led to this point in my life. I‚Äôm hoping to get advice, clarity, opinions anything really would be appreciated. 

  My dad met my step mom she has 3 wonderful girls that I would call my sisters. Good relationships with them. 

Age 6 she comes into my life. She really set the boundary when they bought a new house together. Within 3 weeks of her moved in. I remember playing with toys my rockem sockem toy I got for Christmas. She came into my room and said way out in left field. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you or your brother in our lives I‚Äôm marrying your dad for my daughters and that‚Äôs it.‚Äù 

Through out my childhood whenever I did something that was bad or whatever I would get screamed at by her. She would always tell me that her daughters would be successful and that I would end up being a garbage man if I never did good in school. There was a big fight between her and my dad that she hated the idea that I was in hockey and spending me and dad time doing sports. It got so overwhelming that I just stopped didn‚Äôt care for it anymore. (I played hockey well before she came into my life.) 

I‚Äôm 11 and I took a family trip to go see my grandparents across the country. I can‚Äôt remember what triggered it but I confronted her telling me about how she didn‚Äôt want me in her life in front of my family. My dad pulled me aside in the garage and wanted to know if it was true or not. I said yes he then began repeating the question 6 or 8 times before I sarcastically said no I made it all up. She turns the corner and got mad and defensive. Calling me a liar. That night my dad drove me and two of my step sisters and a cousin of mine to a movie theatre in town. When we got back she polished off two bottles of wine passed out. I turned to my dad and said if that‚Äôs not a sign of guilt idk what is. 

14 my dad and step mom get married. During it all she turns to me and comes right up to my face and points in my face says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you screw this up for me.‚Äù 

As teenager from that point I was always angry, scared and scarred from her. I hated her with a passion. But when I was an adult I didn‚Äôt care anymore. I let it all go. Because I just wanted my dad to be happy. I began to try and have a relationship with her. Trusting her. 

Fast forward to a year ago. I stayed at my dads place and I am just starting out in my career. I‚Äôm struggling with roommates, sleep daily life things. I approached her talked about my career and how I‚Äôm feel like I‚Äôm in rut. I suck and I wanted to be better she was insightful. Really thought she could be finally more accepting of me. Month later I need a place to crash I did night shift 6 hours away I asked my dad and he said of course. I just didn‚Äôt know when they told me we might be done tomorrow or in 2 days I gave him a heads up. Anyway I make it down there I walk in with my own food. The first thing I said was ‚Äúcan I help with anything.‚Äù She told me if I could take some tubs downstairs for her I did it. That night I couldn‚Äôt sleep I was up. 6 am roles around I made my father coffee he asked if I wanted to come to work with him. I said no I just want to sleep. I woke up at 11 and I over hear a conversation with my step mom and my oldest step sister. She spent 45 mins ragging on me. Digging up all the stuff that I did was wrong and my habits and almost everything. She then began talking my career and saying stuff like I‚Äôm not going to do good not gunna make it in my career choice. I was furious I was angry. I walked up the stairs as soon as the conversation was over. She had the dumbest jaw dropping look on her face she was surprise. Took my clothes didn‚Äôt say a word to her and I drove off. I tried killing myself that day. I hated who I was and wondered my I wasn‚Äôt good enough in this world. She tried everything to apologize over text. I wasn‚Äôt buying it didn‚Äôt respond. She later texted me I‚Äôll send the screenshot. I called her a c*** my step sister was very mad at me that I called her that. To the point were she hates me now. But like I ignored her I did everything to avoid talking to her without right saying stop talking to me. 3 days go by and my dad says I want you to drive out here and let‚Äôs all talk about this I tell him no it‚Äôs not up to me to make the effort to fix this. You guys know where I am and I want a 1 on 1 conversation with her without him there. Really has nothing to do with him. He didn‚Äôt like that. Anywho year has gone by my one step sister doesn‚Äôt answer my calls. My step mom has made no effort to fix it. After Christmas I called my dad told him I‚Äôm disappointed in his choice of women. If a year can go by without a real way to resolve this then I need to let go. I began to tell me dad that I don‚Äôt want to talk to him anymore no updates no banter. It‚Äôs not forever I just need to let go of what I‚Äôm carrying. Honestly for the real first time I felt a lot better in my life felt less depressed. Anyway I want to hear what you guys think of this? What should I do from here? Do I have a relationship with my dad? Or do I let go. 

(Can‚Äôt send screen shots but I‚Äôll copy and past)

Your dad is divorcing me for youüëç

Sounds like you put yourself in that situation 

Lol yes your life circumstances are my fault 

Nope your right on that but you didn‚Äôt have to be a c*** about it

You chose to talk sh** about me. You chose to say what you said. 

You chose to show up without the common courtesy of a heads up like an adult, and you were in my basement, i deserve to know I‚Äôm not alone in my own home, you were in the kitchen at 6 am, why didn‚Äôt you let me know you were here? I was walking around naked, as Im  entitled to in my own home, 
You‚Äôre right, i shouldn‚Äôt have said those things in such harsh ways vut you shouldn‚Äôt have been eavesdropping in my basement.

I‚Äôm not even going to give you the satisfaction. You‚Äôre just labeling me as a creep? That‚Äôs pretty low for you. Why don‚Äôt you call me a snake like you did with my uncle? Runs in the family üëçüèº

the starbucks applications are open every single day of the year despite every store i've called saying they're not hiring. the job postings expire every 90 days only to get replaced with a replica listing. it took me three cycles of this expiration-reapply-expiration-reapply loop to finally catch on that no one is looking at my apps. how is this allowed? ive even applied to cafes who actually talk back to their candidates on Indeed, and i'd send them a follow-up message one week later only for them to leave me on read. 

there's one coffee chain that makes their applicants apply on [harri.com](http://harri.com) and they're basically the same as starbucks where their apps are open every day but none of the stores are hiring. i applied back in OCTOBER of last year and didn't hear nothing back. well, i went in-person to one of their chains to ask if theyre hiring again and the supervisor said yes! they say to bring in my resume and apply online. i tweak my resume and i get ready to apply on [harri.com](http://harri.com) only for the site to say that i already applied IN OCTOBER. their listings dont renew, so im scrambling to figure out how to reapply only to figure out that their website will only let me withdraw or archive the application but it won't delete it. harri.com's customer support is pretty much shite so i have to create a whole new account to reapply üôÑ

After I passed those classes, I didn‚Äôt have any trouble finding a job. It was fine. I did that for five years. I didn‚Äôt get certified because I hate to say this, but the medical assisting in phlebotomy community is ghetto and will hire anybody. Anyways I went back to the school for surgical technology. Mind you this school is all accelerated programs so it was 6 months vs like one or two years for surg tech. We had to study 4 Chps a week and then take an exam on it every single week. We had to maintain a 75 in the class or you get kicked out. If you failed a skills test three times you got kicked out. A skills test would be like scrubbing for example. Anyways I BUSTED my ass for 6 months WITH A NEW BORN. I was losing my mind, I didn‚Äôt sleep and got through it with coffee and adderall. But I made it. I passed my certification test. Which mind you was before my clinicals. My certification test was the NCCT. Which is not a normal certification test. We had four weeks to do our clinicals and of course I didn‚Äôt finish. You had a choice to pick if you wanted to do your clinicals once a week, three times a week, the whole week, blah blah blah. I picked the whole week. I stayed as long as possible. I even got them to extend my clinicals a little longer, and I still didn‚Äôt finish. Anyways I did my clinicals at a piedmont outpatient hospital in Atlanta. Hopefully I‚Äôm not outting myself rn and no one from that hospital sees thisüò≠ anyways my preceptors would sign off on my sheet and all of them thought that my sheet looked weird because I went to a tech school so everything was different and my preceptors would constantly shit on the school that I went to and keep telling me it wasn‚Äôt accredited. Which I understand my school was kind of ghetto as shit BUT I did not go through all that for nothing. Anyway the certification test we take is called the NCCT and this is what it says online ab it ‚ÄúThe National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) accredits all seven of the National Center for Competency Testing's (NCCT) healthcare certification programs‚Äù. And in Georgia yk you don‚Äôt have to technically be certified but you‚Äôll have a harder time finding a job. For the NCCT, it‚Äôs hospital dependedant on who will accept that certification tho. SO all that being said I have not been able to find a job anywhere and I‚Äôve applied to EVERY single place I could find that as long as it wasn‚Äôt over an hour away. That‚Äôs ALOT of places. Northeast ga won‚Äôt hire anyone from our school and blacklisted us ig because someone was sent there for clinicals and didn‚Äôt know how to scrub?? How idiotic. Another hospital chain said to me that unless I have 5 years of experience they wouldn‚Äôt hire me bc of my certification. And Piedmont let me do my clinicals but wouldn‚Äôt respond. Outpatients won‚Äôt respond. So here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing now, I am a phlebotomist at a piedmont rn and since is Piedmont‚Äôs policy that you can‚Äôt transfer for six months, I was gonna wait out my 6 months then ask if I could finish my clinicals here. And then ask for a job. Acouple nurses have told me that it will look good that I‚Äôm already working here and I figured if I could get them to atleast let me finish my clinicals that maybe I could prove myself enough for them to hire me even though they might frown at my ‚Äúcertification‚Äù. I was going to get like malpractice insurance and shit if that would help my case idk.

1iaxk8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/originalloquat/comments/1iaxk8g/the_dinner_party_short_story_4100_words/,The Dinner Party (Short Story) (4100 words),"I rubbed my eyes and lit a cigarette.¬†



‚ÄòI thought you were quitting,‚Äô Emma said, sauntering from the unmade bed into the kitchen. She wore a white vest and no bra.¬†



‚ÄòI will when things‚Ä¶ calm down.‚Äô¬†



She smiled coyly. ‚ÄòDid you phone BT?‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòI will. I will.‚Äô



‚ÄòYou know, I always thought when people said they weren‚Äôt morning people, it was just an expression- but wow, you really aren't a morning person.‚Äô¬†



I stopped myself from snapping back. It‚Äôs what my Dad would‚Äôve done, and then there was talk of divorce with my Mam before the cornflakes had been poured.¬†



‚ÄòI just, I just,‚Äô I stuttered, watching the cigarette burn down like a fuse. ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt they just shut the fuck up?‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòWear earplugs like me.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòI can hear my heartbeat when I‚Äôm trying to sleep.‚Äô¬†



Once again, she smiled that smile. It was the same smile she wore in the picture on the fridge of her as a kid‚Äì the one her Mam had taken when she‚Äôd just caught her drawing on the wall.¬†



‚ÄòI‚Äôll get you a coffee, babe.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòIt won‚Äôt even make a dent.‚Äô¬†



I went back to my copy of the Great Gatsby‚Äì the screen of my laptop open- **1. The notion of the American dream figures preeminently in this story. How should readers define the American dream?**¬†



With my sleep-deprived brain, reading the book had been like learning to meditate. Five seconds of concentration until unrelated thoughts rammed into my head like train cars.¬†¬†



So we beat on, boats against the current, born back into *fucking. Why do they spend all night fucking?*



Beside me was a Matthew Walker book on sleep, and I sulkily chucked it across the couch. How could you get into a good circadian rhythm when the neighbours were shagging so loudly every night? 12, 1, 2, fucking so raucously that every morning I had to readjust my Matisse print on the connecting wall.¬†



‚ÄòIf it bothers you so much, why don‚Äôt you say something?‚Äô Emma continued, putting my mug on the table. My Mam had bought it when we started our second year at university and moved in together. It said student+dying= studying.¬†



‚ÄòBecause I‚Äôm English,‚Äô I replied. ‚ÄòEngish people don‚Äôt complain.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòThat‚Äôs the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever heard.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòI‚Äôm just kidding.‚Äô¬†



But it was only half true. I was terribly shy and, on top of that, anxious- still a kid, really.¬†



Emma laughed when we signed the contract for the apartment. The landlord, Dan, had shown us around, and when we shook hands, I‚Äôd said: ‚ÄòThanks for helping us out, Dad.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòFresh air,‚Äô She continued.¬†



She went to the window and cracked it open. It was a beautiful city centre view looking out over Newcastle quayside. We couldn‚Äôt really afford it, but then, because of my degree, I was already in ¬£40,000 worth of debt, so what was another five?¬†



She came back over, and the chill wind of the Tyne outside hardened her nipples. She caught me looking and laughed.¬†



‚ÄòWell, I haven‚Äôt made the bed yet? We might as well go back to it.‚Äô¬†



For all my various hangups and neuroses, I was lucky that my sexual life hadn‚Äôt been too badly affected. I took her by the hand, knowing at least the next 30 minutes would be ok.¬†



‚Ä¶¬†



Sometimes, I‚Äôd even question if I was sexually attracted to Emma. I mean, I was obviously because we had sex 3 or 4 times a week, but the much stronger feeling was a kind of entrancement.¬†



Most of the time, I‚Äôd just watch Emma- how she moved. I‚Äôd focus intently on her collar bones, neckline, or the backs of her knees where those lines that formed an uppercase H came to life.¬†



She was lying on my chest as I stroked her head, and I got lost in a trance, counting the black hairs flowing out the centre parting on the top of her head.¬†



‚ÄòHow can people be like that?‚Äô I said, staring up at the white ceiling. ‚ÄòMaking so much noise when they‚Äôre fucking‚Ä¶ It's gratuitous. Like porn.‚Äô¬†



Emma drifted back from sleep. ‚ÄòAre we still on about this? Just say something to them.‚Äô



‚ÄòAnd the crescendo when she orgasms. It sounds like one of those animals dying on *nature is metal*.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòWell, they say some women can‚Äôt control the noises they make when they cum.‚Äô¬†



I felt her stiffen almost imperceptibly, and I wouldn‚Äôt have felt it at all if she hadn‚Äôt been splayed out all over me.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòBut you, you don‚Äôt lose your mind like that.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòNo, true.‚Äô¬†



And then it hit me.¬†



The well-rested mind is good at suppressing all those things that might overwhelm you.¬†



‚ÄòWhy don't you make those noises?‚Äô I continued.¬†



‚ÄòLike you say, it's over the top.‚Äô¬†



I propped myself up against the headboard, and Matisse shook again.¬†



‚ÄòWait,‚Äô I said, ‚Äòyou do orgasm when we have sex, don‚Äôt you?‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòYes, of course I do.‚Äô¬†



But I couldn‚Äôt let it go.



‚ÄòLook at me, Em. You do cum, don‚Äôt you?‚Äô¬†



I knew. I fucking knew.¬†



‚ÄòJesus Christ. I can‚Äôt believe this. You‚Äôre telling me we‚Äôve been together one year, and I never made you cum once.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt say that.‚Äô¬†



But her eyes flicked down and to the left, and I knew just as sure as I loved her that it was true.¬†



‚ÄòFucking hell.‚Äô¬†



I jumped up from the bed.¬†



‚ÄòThis whole 12 months has been a lie.‚Äô¬†



She was still affecting a look of indifference, and then she collapsed under the weight of my accusations.¬†



‚ÄòLook, it's not a big deal. I mean, I never have, with anyone.‚Äô¬†



But by this point, I was completely swept away by hysteria.¬†



‚ÄòAnyone, so I‚Äôm just anyone? I‚Äôm the same as Spacker John, who put his fingers up your skirt at Digital.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòPlease, just calm down and come back to bed.‚Äô¬†



I thrust my right leg into the left leg of my jeans and nearly tipped over.¬†



‚ÄòIt's all been bullshit.‚Äô I repeated. ‚Äò12 months. How many times is that? 100? And every time you‚Äôve been faking it?‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòNo, no. You know how much I love it. I just... have never been able to.‚Äô¬†



There was such a swirling torrent of emotions inside of me. Anger at being lied to, but shame more than anything. What kind of man couldn‚Äôt make his girlfriend cum‚Äì worse‚Äì didn‚Äôt even know his girlfriend wasn‚Äôt cumming? I was one of those 1950s husbands who put out all the lights, politely rutted for 2 minutes, as his wife fantasized about the milkman.¬†



‚ÄòWhere are you going?‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòOut! Out of this house of lies.‚Äô¬†



She tried not to smile at the melodrama of it all, and this was enough to really send me over the edge. I threw on a jacket and slammed the front door behind me.¬†



‚Ä¶



I spent the day in a coffee shop, wishing for the end of the world.¬†



Then, around 5, I returned home, and the first burning embers of guilt began to flare up. I wasn‚Äôt a psychologist, but I knew that if a woman tells you she can‚Äôt cum, making a massive deal about it is probably the last thing you should do.¬†



‚ÄòEm, look, I‚Äôm sorry. I just wish you‚Äôd told me. We can‚Äôt be like one of those couples who never talk.‚Äô¬†



She kissed my eyelids. ‚ÄòI know, I know. It just never bothered me, that‚Äôs all.‚Äô¬†



Somewhere deep down, I could still feel that raging torrent, but now wasn‚Äôt the time to address it. You shouldn‚Äôt attempt to defuse an IED when you‚Äôre already feeling blown through with other holes.¬†



‚ÄòI talked to Natalie,‚Äô she continued.¬†



I slumped down on the couch, turning over some fresher problem that had crept into my mind.¬†



‚ÄòNatalie,‚Äô she repeated as I stared off into space.¬†



‚ÄòAye, that lass from Danserxise?‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòNo, Natalie, we met in the lift. She's the woman from next door.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòWait. What? You mean the screamer?‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòShe was taking their bulldog out. We got chatting. I tell you, she‚Äôs like a movie star.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòWe are talking about the porn actress that keeps me up all night here, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äô

¬†

‚ÄòShe‚Äôs not a porn actress. In fact, she‚Äôs a dropshipper‚Äì whatever that is‚Äì and I‚Äôve invited her and her husband around for dinner tonight.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòWoah, woah, woah, you‚Äôve invited them around. How am I gonna‚Ä¶‚Äô



‚ÄòAfter I‚Äôve served the first course, you can ask them to stop shagging.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòEm, Em, what the fuck, Em?‚Äô I was back on my feet.



‚ÄòI‚Äôm kidding. I‚Äôm kidding. But you know, when they realize that they‚Äôre living next door to someone- it‚Äôs not just an empty room‚Äì it might help.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòWell, it looks like I don‚Äôt have a fucking choice, does it?‚Äô¬†



It could have escalated into an argument, but it rarely did with Emma. Arguing with her was like shouting at a mill pond. Nothing much affected her, and you‚Äôd end up feeling daft.¬†



‚Ä¶



It's strange to meet someone for the first time when you‚Äôve already heard them in the throes of ecstasy. It spoke to something in my personality that I felt a little guilty.¬†



Natalie, from next door, didn‚Äôt look like I imagined when she started endangering the structural integrity of the building at 2 am.¬†



I thought she‚Äôd be a student like us, with pink hair and lip piercings. Instead, she was clutching a bottle of expensive red wine and dressed like Kate Middleton‚Äì classy and reserved‚Äì with an air of confidence that didn‚Äôt come from what she‚Äôd read in the First Year, but an entire life of social clout‚Äì stretching back centuries and centuries to some ancient seat of power deep in the Northumbrian countryside.¬†



I was instantly intimidated. You could have all this sparkling wit and philosophy about Camus, but whatever confidence she held was older than existentialism‚Äì it was older than England.¬†



Who was I? The first in my family to go to university. If I went home, I‚Äôd sit at home silently while my parents watched Michael Mcintyre's The Wheel in an old council house. Her family was the Wheel, turning society generation after generation.¬†



Emma, as always, was serene and welcomed them like old friends.¬†



Natalie took me by the hand and leaned in for a kiss, and I awkwardly brushed her cheek, fretting I‚Äôd scratched her porcelain skin with my stubble.



I was so busy worrying about how to greet her that I didn't even consider her husband behind until he smiled at me.¬†



Sometimes in life, you meet these people who seem to have leaped from a work of art. I was in a Starbucks once in Utrecht, and this girl poured me an ice water, and I could‚Äôve sworn she was the same girl from that Vermeer painting. The only difference was that instead of a pearl earring, she wore AirPods.¬†



Nicholas looked at me, and it was the same smile from the Great Gatsby. *He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor.*¬†



‚ÄòGreat to meet you,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòIt's really great.¬†



I stood there like a mannequin and thank god for Emma, who invited them in properly and poured them each a glass of our Tesco wine.¬†



‚ÄòWell,‚Äô he continued, ‚ÄòI might just have to have a word with Mr. Dan Armitage because your apartment has a much better view than ours.‚Äô¬†



The other two laughed merrily, and then I did, slightly delayed because my brain was working slower.¬†



‚ÄòWe‚Äôre students,‚Äô Emma replied, deftly. ‚ÄòHe probably gets a tax break to have at least one student couple in the building.‚Äô¬†



Already I needed a rest. I took an inordinate amount of time at the fridge selecting a beer. It was rammed full of Stella. Could I drink Stella at a dinner party? My saving grace was some real Belgian beer we‚Äôd picked up at the airport on the way back from Holland. Somewhat ominously, it was called La Guillotine, but the bottle was highly presentable.¬†



‚ÄòNow is the time someone less witty would make a joke about you liking a strong blonde.‚Äô Nicholas said, pointing at the bottle. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a nice drop, is it, pal?‚Äô¬†



Again I thought of Gatsby. Was *pal* his *old sport*?¬†



Emma led them over to the small table where our somewhat limited dining set had been laid out.¬†¬†



They were dressed well, not fabulously (as I was tempted to write) because fabulously connotes a kind of extravagance.¬†



The right kind of rich people no longer dress ostentatiously. Sometime in the 1960s, it became bad form‚Ä¶ Poor people copied the rich of the past, and the rich went minimalist.¬†



He wore an eggshell blue polo that matched his eyes, cream chinos, and brown shoes. His silver watch had a slim wristband and was an Italian brand I‚Äôd never heard of. His wedding ring was simple gold. He had elegant fingers, the pink parts of the nail walls well defined, and his arms were muscular and brown.¬†



‚ÄòSo what do you do, Nicholas?‚Äô Emma said.¬†



‚ÄòI‚Äôm a gym owner.‚Äô¬†



That was the last thing I expected him to say.¬†



‚ÄòReally, I go to the one on Clayton Street, just signed up.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòI wish I‚Äôd known; I would‚Äôve given you a free membership at one of ours. I hate to think your landlord is more generous than your neighbour.‚Äô¬†



Emma smiled, clearly charmed. I would‚Äôve thought he was a bastard if I wasn‚Äôt similarly taken by him.¬†



‚ÄòWhere is your gym?‚Äô She continued.¬†



‚ÄòWell, there‚Äôs one at St James and one in Carliol Square.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòOh right, it's a chain. I know it, the one with the glove and the peace symbol? I saw them in Edinburgh too when we went up for the weekend. Do you remember?‚Äô¬†



She turned to me as I drank La Guillotine like medicine.



I flinched at being included in the conversation, and a little beer ran down my chin. Befitting their station, the couple pretended not to notice.¬†¬†



‚ÄòYes, we have 30 locations around the country. It started in Edinburgh. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm from.‚Äô¬†



He didn‚Äôt look like his wife, the young English duchess. He was just as aesthetically appealing, no doubt, but his face was Scottish in a way difficult to describe if you haven‚Äôt spent a lot of time there.¬†



‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just luck,‚Äô he continued, ‚ÄòI grew up in the gym- so I got to see what was good and bad before I was even aware of it.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt look like a boxer,‚Äô I replied.¬†



He smiled, all perfect white teeth and slim nose without the slightest trace of a crack in it.¬†



‚ÄòI was a good boxer, I mean better than anyone I fought in Edinburgh, and then when I took a step up in competition, I had enough sense to realize it was only downhill from there.‚Äô He gestured at a stack of books on the table. ‚ÄòWhat is it Orwell says?: *I have the ability to face up to uncomfortable facts.*‚Äô¬†



What kind of businessman come boxer quoted Orwell?



‚ÄòYou like Orwell?‚Äô I replied.¬†



‚ÄòNo,‚Äô he threw his hands in the air. ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt claim to be an expert. I don't have any sort of university degree‚Ä¶‚Äô His blue eyes sparkled. ‚ÄòI'll let you in on a secret. 90% of the success in your life will be down to generalisability. I can tell you that Ernest Hemingway‚Äôs best book is For Whom The Bell Tolls, and I can tell you why, but did I ever read it? No.‚Äô¬†



All at once, he was completely open yet without leaking the slightest bit of vulnerability. If I took to letting down my defences, I appeared like a suppurating, ugly wound, and people felt no choice but to avert their eyes.



His wife stroked his hand, spinning the wedding ring around his groomed, slender finger.¬†



For a second, I remembered how much I‚Äôd hated them when I heard them late at night. Yet now, I felt admiration bordering on devotion. He could fuck his beautiful wife all night if he wanted.¬†¬†



‚ÄòOf course, you must know the best story of Papa Hemingway,‚Äô he continued, ‚Äòa tour guide in Paris told us‚Ä¶ One day, Hemingway and Fitzgerald are drinking in a cafe when Fitzgerald says, ‚ÄúHem, my wife has been questioning the size of my manhood. She says with a member that size, she will never be satisfied.‚Äô""



‚ÄòOh, come on, Nick.‚Äô Natalie cut in. ‚ÄòNot this story.‚Äô¬†



But it was said with no real force, more of a polite nod to us that we had permission to be offended, not that we‚Äôd take it.



‚ÄòAnyway, Hemingway coolly sips his vermouth and says, ‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôs only one way to find out, join me in *le water*.‚Äù The two great writers of the 20th century saunter through the restaurant to the toilet, and Fitzgerald takes down his trousers, and Papa Hemingway goes in for a closer look.'¬†



‚ÄúWell, Scotty, everything looks proportional to me,"" Hemingway replies.¬†



‚ÄúReally? Zelda is just twisting the knife.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúCertainly, old chap, and if you have any more concerns, just go down to the Louvre and peruse those Michelangelo statues.‚Äù¬†



Emma lit up, and my joy at seeing it was quickly replaced by a primaeval terror. Was that the problem? Did she need a massive dick? Terror. Sheer terror. The only refuge was La Guillotine.¬†



Emma served the first course, but I could barely even taste it because I washed it down with so much beer. I needed to reach that equilibrium. My thoughts were stampeding horses. The alcohol corralled them.¬†¬†



The main course came, and I paid even less attention to it. In fact, I resented it because I could feel the food soaking up the booze.



‚ÄòTell me now about dropshipping.‚Äô Emma said to Natalie.¬†



‚ÄòOh, that,‚Äô she said, swirling the red wine around the glass. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just a hobby.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòDon‚Äôt be modest,‚Äô Nicholas said. ‚ÄòYour store is very successful.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòIt doesn‚Äôt require much to be successful. It‚Äôs all about imitation, really. You browse the web, find a winning design, and then put that design in your online store. It's branding, ultimately.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòWhat my lovely wife is omitting is that she has a BA from the London School of Economics.‚Äô¬†¬†



‚ÄòBut getting into a good university is not much more than good branding as well. You yourself are the brand. I wouldn‚Äôt put too much weight behind a good degree‚Ä¶‚Äô She paused. ‚ÄòI mean that in the nicest way possible.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòYes, but you still need to write the essays,‚Äô Nicholas continued.¬†



‚ÄòWell, the funny thing about that is that you don‚Äôt really, not anymore. There was a Chinese girl on my course. The best student in class. And then she stopped coming to lectures. However, it didn‚Äôt seem to matter because she continued to receive the top grade. Anyway, one day it came through that this poor girl had been hit by a London city bus and killed, 25; what a tragedy, yet from beyond the grave, she was completely diligent. She never missed a deadline. It emerged that she‚Äôd been paying someone an exorbitant amount of money on Upwork to complete every assignment for her, and clearly, her freelancer hadn‚Äôt received the news. We brought it up with the course leader, and it didn‚Äôt bother him as long as the projects were handed in on time. Cut forward to graduation, and this girl passed with a distinction. Obviously, she was not there to collect it.‚Äô¬†



It might‚Äôve sounded a little glib, but coming from her mouth, the anecdote seemed utterly charming.¬†



Dessert was served, and I didn‚Äôt even make any pretence of attempting it. La Guillotine ran out; instead, I cracked open a bottle of whiskey.¬†



Emma took Natalie off to look at her artwork in the bedroom. I was happy now in the warm glow of whiskey and Nicholas‚Äô easy charm.¬†



I could tell from his accent alone that he‚Äôd come from a similar place to myself. With more alcohol, he slid away sometimes into Edinburgh Scottish that his sober brain dampened down. Words like *ken* and *bairn* and *wee yin* slid into his vocabulary.¬†



I‚Äôd hit that equilibrium with the alcohol. The golden zone where I still retained the core element of my personality and felt confident enough that I could at least show a touch of weakness without collapsing in on myself.¬†



‚ÄòDo you mind if I ask you something?‚Äô I said.¬†



‚ÄòOf course, pal.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòDid you get with a lot of girls when you were younger?‚Äô¬†



He smiled that smile.¬†



‚ÄòI did well by the standard expected of me.‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòWhat do you mean expected of you?‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòWell, 15 years ago, in the circles I mixed, it was a badge of honour to sleep with as many girls as possible‚Ä¶ It never much appealed to me, but I did it anyway because it was normal.‚Äô¬†



He ran his hand through his immaculate blonde hair. The smell of aftershave mixed with whiskey drifted over.¬†



‚ÄòThere was one moment that made me stop. I met this girl in a bar, and she asked me to go home with her. She had this apartment out in Jesmond, and we did the deed, and that was all good, and then I‚Äôm lying in bed after, and she‚Äôs walking around all naked and angelic, and I said this is one of the best first dates I ever had. She looked at me, first smiling, and then in anger. She goes. ‚Äúfirst date, you don‚Äôt remember, do you? We‚Äôve slept together before, six months ago. This is your second time here.‚Äù‚Äô he paused, smelling the whiskey. ‚ÄòI tell you, I had no recollection of her or her apartment, and I realised then that we‚Äôd shared something so personal, and I had no memory of it. What kind of way was that to live? Anyway, a year later, I met Natalie, and we took it slow, and it built and built into the best thing I‚Äôve ever had. Forget the gyms, the watches, all of the accoutrements. I would move into a terrace in Benwell and shovel shite for the rest of my life if only I had her.‚Äô¬†



I had the vague sense that what he was saying had an element of profundity to it, but my own mind was consumed by base elements of living.¬†



‚ÄòIt worked from the very beginning, sexually, I mean?‚Äô¬†



‚ÄòWe built,‚Äô he replied, ‚Äòthese things take time. I mean, you need the fundamentals, the 2-step, if you will, and then you find the right partner, and if you communicate, you get into more advanced movements.‚Äô he paused, laughing, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm glad I used a dance metaphor because I was tempted to use boxing and that could have sent a mixed message. When you‚Äôre younger and a boxer, you have the idea that you can conquer someone when it's all about collaboration.‚Äô¬†



The women returned from the bedroom, and Natalie gushed over Emma‚Äôs designs and all the great things they could do together with the dropshipping business.¬†



‚ÄòWhat are you guys talking about?‚Äô Natalie said.¬†



‚ÄòMen‚Äôs talk,‚Äô I answered, ‚Äòamorous concerns.‚Äô¬†



It sounded a lot cleverer in my head and made me sound even more stupid when it left my mouth because the words were all mangled by whiskey. I was rapidly exiting the golden zone.¬†



Emma tipped me a concerned look. It wouldn‚Äôt be the first time she‚Äôd put me to bed.¬†

1iaxjvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1iaxjvp/how_to_be_an_awesome_house_guest/,How to be an Awesome House Guest,"When someone invites you to their home, they are giving you a gift. Circumstances vary widely, but usually, the guest owes something non-monetary in return for the gift of time, effort, skill, and expense. The host is investing in the guest. What does he or she receive in return?

Although cultures differ, one thing is constant in hospitality: the guest should show gratitude.

Sometimes that gratitude should appear before the event even begins. Any invited guest should respond with an RSVP or a returned phone call. Often, the guest should bring a gift when invited to a special meal or for an overnight or extended stay.

In this post, however, we will address the most basic and universal meetings between host and guest: a meal; coffee, tea, or snacks; a time of recreation and socializing.

While it might seem to the guest that the host did not go to much trouble, a guest should consider what goes into the gift of hospitality, large or small.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Time:** The host must set aside the time. Time is one of our most valuable resources, and giving up an evening or afternoon is a sacrifice. ¬†The host might otherwise be working, taking care of responsibilities, spending time with loved ones, or simply unwinding. Instead, they are giving that time to you.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Expense**: Even if the host serves veggies they grew themselves, food is an expense. Simple cookies and a cup of coffee can be a generous offering to the guest for a low-income family. Giving always costs someone something.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Effort:** Creating a welcoming space might simply mean moving newspapers off the couch, but it always requires some effort. Usually, a host will try to find or buy appealing food; clean, set up, or prepare the place where they will share food; and possibly even use special dishes or linens.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Skill:** Hosts often use their culinary or presentation skills to make the meal exchange special. Your host might make a special recipe, create a comfortable atmosphere, clean their home, or arrange decorations to please guests. They might choose music or an ambiance to make guests happy or comfortable.

If you are a guest, you should make it a habit to recognize the time, expense, effort, and skill required to host you. Doing so will enrich the time with your host and help you better connect.

How will you respond to hospitality? Here are some common ways to reciprocate the care your host has offered.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Be punctual:** If a host has worked hard so everything is ready and food is warm, tardy guests can cause problems. Be on time.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Show gratitude:** Any host deserves thanks‚Äîfrom the time you walk in the door. Remember, this event or meal is a gift. You can show your gratitude in a number of ways.

**1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Host Gift:** A bottle of wine, flowers, a plate of home-made cookies, or a jar of your grandmother‚Äôs preserves are thoughtful gifts.

**2.¬†¬†¬†¬† Effort:** Offering to help serve or clean up is usually welcome in an informal meal.

**3.¬†¬†¬†¬† Contribution to the meal:** For somewhat informal meals, it‚Äôs good to ask what you can bring to contribute, whether bread, salad, dessert, or drinks. The host should be providing the main elements of the meal. Drinks or snacks might be welcome for a movie or game night.

**4.¬†¬†¬†¬† Thank you note:** If you received an invitation via mail or electronically, you should at least send a thank you the way you were invited. For example, if you received a paper invitation, you should send a traditional thank-you note. If you received an email or other electronic invitation, you should call, text, or email a heartfelt thank-you‚Äîeven though the hard copy is often still the best. Send it promptly: the same evening or the next day.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Use your words:** Rather than generally raving about how nice everything is, comment on something specific you liked. That way, your host will know you were paying attention and engaged in the meal.

¬ß¬† ‚ÄúThe pasta was amazing! Thank you for making such a special dish.‚Äù

¬ß¬† ‚ÄúAlthough I enjoyed the whole meal, your dessert was my favorite part. Thank you.‚Äù

¬ß¬† ‚ÄúWhat a beautiful table! You certainly know how to set up a welcoming meal.‚Äù

¬ß¬† ‚ÄúThe conversation made me feel so at home. Thank you for listening to what I shared. That means a lot to me.‚Äù

¬ß¬† ‚ÄúI really enjoyed just hanging out with you and having snacks. Thank you for making this time happen for us.‚Äù

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Smiles:** Showing you are having a good time makes the effort and expense worthwhile. Arriving with a smile, upholding good cheer through your time together, and exiting with a handshake or friendly hug can seal the deal that a gathering is intended to create.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Reciprocate:** In many cultures, guests are expected to invite the host in return. This custom varies from place to place, but if you want to develop a relationship with the host, you should think of a way to reciprocate.

Sometimes an event doesn‚Äôt turn out the way you wanted it to. You can still thank your host for their effort and time in preparing and presenting the meal or hosting the event.

I got my boy Loki from a farm when he was \~6 weeks old. Someone had dumped him there, so we're unsure what sort of things happened to him before that age. He wasn't feral, but he was fearful. In the year and a half since, he's become extremely bonded to me and will seek me out for comfort. He's literally terrified of everything and everyone else.

Someone comes in? He is *gone* \- hiding under the bed and refusing to come out. Dog barks? Doesn't matter if he's in his ""safe spot"" loafing inside my house coat cuddling - he is jumping away as if I suddenly turned to aside. My partner stirs his coffee with a spoon - eyes wide, airplane ears, zooming towards my bedroom. Hell, he'll slink away if my partner even looks at him funny.

I am uncertain what to do at this point. I was hoping that with age, he would mellow out, or that he would look to my older cats  - a senior 16 year old and a 9 year old, who just absolutely do not react, and learn to relax, but that's not the case. He's still just as randomly fearful as he ever was. I attributed it at first to whatever happened to him before I got him, but at this point, I doubt he even remembers that far back.

Would anyone have any tips or tricks that I can use to put him at ease in his own home? It hurts to see him be so terrified at random noises and sounds when he should just be happy and relaxed.",1,1737945227.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False

I got the Wanwu mini bali and added the optional ring .  I've been fidgeting with it, but not feeling it...so it will probably go up for sale.  Also picked up the Bruce Charles Design Robertson brass slider with the Equal middle plate..these are fun and super high quality. Next are two YEDC Pig Ceramic fidgets- one is a slider and the other a mix mechanical and haptic coin. I also have the coin in SS too, but prefer the Ceramic. It has a ""clack clack"" sound/feel to it that's different...like hitting 2 stones together (which basically what ceramic is)..so keep an eye out for the SS going up for sale too. Then there's the new Muyi X MOT PEACOCK, which is just a Shuffle just in a different form...it kinda fits in my hand better bc of the curve. And what looks like a Nutter Butter cookie (yummy my fav) is by far the funnest slider I have.....it flies around and I have no worries about dropping it! Then we have what looks like a fidget stick... which is half right....it's actually a hex bit holder with Ti shaft (hehe I said shaft üòÅ) and Zirc spinning  head by Metonboss...this thing is not only fun and fidgety ( although it doesn't spin as long as a dedicated fidget stick) it's practical bc I'm a FSE and this will just be part part of my tools I carry every day. I updated the lanyard on the Shuffle v3 with a Wanwu PAPER CUP Knife Bead Fidget Spinner Coffee Zirc & Brass...and yes that brass middle piece spins! I forgot I had the Around Square Beglari and I forgot to picture (bc I don't know where it is atm) the Knucklebone. Also the Ladder sliders that I got off Etsy (the BCD knockoffs) I forgot I also had black 3D printed versions as well. Also I just found out.... all of the ladder sliders both the Etsy ones and the BCD play nicely together...I can mix and match them...the combinations are limitless! Ha! And the final one that I totally forgot about is the magnet ball bearing spinner. I.forget the official name of it...but it spins around that center piece soooo smoothly.

1iaxgxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckeryUniveristy/comments/1iaxgxn/beans_and_bullets/,Beans And Bullets,"We‚Äôd conducted an amphibious landing on the Korean coast, in the winter season, three days previously.  We‚Äôd begun moving inland, after we‚Äôd made our way through the thin belt of trees along the shoreline.  And we‚Äôd been on the move, on foot, day and night, since then.  The only relief an occasional halt that never lasted for more than twenty minutes or so, and usually for much less than that.  

Mason and I were exhausted, sleep-deprived, and had sweated off about five pounds apiece on scullery duty aboard ship Before we‚Äôd left it. Our Plt Sgt Hardass was a vindictive individual, and the two of us were still paying for some things.  Entirely innocent of the allegations, of course. As always.  Angels without wings. We should‚Äôve been issued olive drab halos.  

And none of us had eaten in all that time, except for the odd candy bar from Ship‚Äôs Store that had been divided and shared around the first day.  

A breakdown in logistics was the reason given, but we smelled distinct musty odor of rodent. We were being toyed with again, in our experience and opinion.  Such a scenario as this might easily play out in real time in future, and so let‚Äôs see how far and how hard we can push these guys in adverse conditions and have them still be effective. 

‚ÄúThe Long Walk‚Äù.  We‚Äôd covered a lot of ground.  ‚ÄúMiles to go before we sleep.‚Äù

Sleep was something you learned to do anywhere at any time in any conditions.  A few minutes here, a few minutes there.  Just close your eyes and you‚Äôre gone.  

You could just zone out a little while walking.  Half asleep on your feet, in a sense, but still aware of and alert to everything around you.  

I knew guys who could sleep soundly in the back of a truck on a rough road as they were being bounced and jostled around. 

I fell asleep sitting with my back against the trunk of a tree in cold pouring rain once, and rested well. 

But as on the Seventh Day, we rested for a couple of hours on what was our fourth. I don‚Äôt now recall how far we‚Äôd come, but can make an educated estimated wild-ass guess, being conservative:

On our annual fast-paced route march for time, 25 miles in 7 hours, if I remember right, was minimally acceptable. 3 times that would be 75 miles and a little more in 24 hours, if the pace could have been maintained.  But this time we‚Äôd been moving at a slower route pace, and carrying an issue of cold weather gear in addition to our weapons and usual standard kit.  We‚Äôd still covered a lot of distance. 

There was a reason some of us who‚Äôd been slim to start with no longer had much body fat at all, over time.  Just strong, wiry muscle.  But we could go on 
as long as we needed to, and still be capable of immediately going into action when we got there, or along the way.  

Which was the stated goal.  As one Battalion Commander once told us:  ‚ÄúIf Roman Legionaires could do it, so can you.  And you‚Äôre going to.‚Äù

Or another:  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll face the Soviet Union in the field one day.  They have more troops and more equipment, and they always will.  We‚Äôll never match them for that.  But they rely too much on transport, which we also won‚Äôt have enough of.  So we have to be better prepared to move on foot.  Better man for man.  Turn their strength into their weakness.  That applies to the tactics we teach you, as well.‚Äù

Their view on things, anyway. 

But as to that 2 hour stop:  at a point along the way, you‚Äôd stopped really feeling hungry anymore.  It had become a distant thing, to be put in the back of your mind and disregarded.  You can go a long time without eating, if you have plenty of water.  And water we were continually supplied with (see what I mean, lol).  Without water, no one was going to last long.  

Later came a kind of euphoria, as lack of food and increasing exhaustion set in.  You didn‚Äôt feel physically tired anymore, except in a distant academic sense.  Your feet felt as if they never quite touched the ground.  You were as light as a feather, and knew you could go on forever.  

But when that finally passes, and you start to come down from it, you crashed Hard.  It all catches up to you.  

We weren‚Äôt in good shape by then, and Mason had I hadn‚Äôt been to start with.  Everyone desperately needed those two hours of sleep.  And something to eat.  The rest of the Battalion were in the same boat. 

But no sleep for Mason and me, lol.  And a few others.  We‚Äôd really pissed him off that last time, and he‚Äôd taken it personal.  

And that fellow hillbilly could carry a grudge like a bucket holds water, lol.  He seemed to Hate my young self sometimes.  But we enjoyed each others‚Äô company off-duty, and got into more than a little trouble together.  Buddies. Life can be strange. 

The conclusion I‚Äôve reached over time is that I reminded him too much of himself. I was as least as stubborn as he was.  We butted heads a lot.  Maybe it was just something in the genes.  We were both from the Hills, and ours are some of the most hard-headed people on earth.  Scottish, English, and Irish ancestry for the most part. 

I was seeing things that I knew weren‚Äôt there, by that point.  And I was wishing the guy standing beside me would just shut Up! He was becoming irritating.  Would‚Äôve been nice to clock him one.  But I‚Äôd already glanced his way, and he wasn‚Äôt there, either.  Kept on nattering, though.  üòÇüòÇ

‚ÄúEverybody!  We‚Äôll be heard for a couple of hours!‚Äù from Hardass.  ‚ÄúDrop your packs and get some sleep.‚Äù

About time, and I dropped mine and prepared to do the same:

‚ÄúNot you, asshole!‚Äù  (I was the asshole in question at the moment).  You come with me.‚Äù

Oh, you rat bastard!

Perimeter guard watch.  Extended perimeter.  By myself.  Mason, I assumed, was standing his own. But maybe not.  Hardass, that tic on a dog‚Äôs ass, had seemed to hold me primarily responsible for some reason (wasn‚Äôt).  And someone had to be on watch anyway. 

‚ÄúSo Tired‚Äù I thought, not long into it.  ‚ÄúThink
I‚Äôll just sit down for a minute‚Ä¶..lean back against this tree‚Ä¶‚Ä¶won‚Äôt even close my eyes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúHehehe.‚Äù

Opened ‚Äòem again.  How and when had that happened?  

Marines I didn‚Äôt know or recognize.  And they had my rifle and  my radio.  

4 of ‚Äòem.  A probing patrol.  Sneak and peek. Gather intelligence.  I was ashamed.  I‚Äôd just let my friends down in the worst possible way.  In other older times and places, I‚Äôd have been executed in front of them for this.  Never should have sat down.  

Maybe give a shout of warning;  bring help on the run‚Ä¶‚Ä¶would they even hear me?

‚ÄúYou try, we‚Äôll buttstroke your ass‚Äù from the smiling fire team leader, reading my thoughts.  Holding his rifle ready to do so. 

A happy nod from one of his riflemen in complete agreement.  

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Would they?‚Ä¶.Yeah.  I would have.  They‚Äôd pull it, but it was still gonna hurt. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre comin‚Äô with us.‚Äù

Then another thought occurred to me:  ‚ÄúThere anything to eat there?‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòCourse.  Why you ask?‚Äù

‚ÄúNever mind.‚Äù  Ha!  Silver lining.

The base camp of some assigned aggressors from another unit whom we‚Äôd been told were operating somewhere in the vicinity.  And they had a field mess tent set up.  Mouthwatering time to the point I had to keep swallowing it down as my shriveled stomach reminded me how empty it was.  

Driving a borrowed jeep, Hardass showed up before too long.  Someone had sent word that there was a little lost captured sheep to come collect. I was sitting on a short stack of wooden ammo crates with a tray in my lap.  Little cardboard cartons of milk and juice.  Hot food, and, Thank God!, hot coffee.  

I‚Äôd been eating slow, a little at a time - didn‚Äôt want to throw it all back up again.  Until here he came.  And from the look on his face, he was a lot more pissed off than even he habitually was.  

Started eating a little faster as he shut off the engine, climbed out, and started my way.  He might just kick the tray out of my hands before the scrap began.  

‚Ä¶..But then he stopped.  His face changed.  And he was looking at the tray on my lap;

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you get that?‚Äù

Mouth full, I nodded toward the mess tent not far away, and off he went.  

Shortly I heard voices raised in argument from inside it, one louder than the rest:  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a flyin‚Äô Fuck if we ain‚Äôt from your god damn unit!!‚Äù

In short order, he was sitting next to me digging into a tray of his own as the jeep was being loaded.  

‚ÄúThis ain‚Äôt over, OP.  We‚Äôre still gonna talk about it later.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat I figured.‚Äù

We left with a jeep loaded down with hot chow in as many mess canisters as it would hold.  And coffee.  Hot soup.  Milk cartons bulging with milk and juice.   With the understanding that we‚Äôd be coming back for more if we needed to.  Word had come down that we‚Äôd be remaining in place until further notice.  But still no mention of chow. 

He could be persuasive.  And we were off to feed our boys.  

So I went from dereliction of duty to the man of the hour in the shortest turnaround imaginable, lol.  

As Harley put it:  ‚ÄúMan, OP, your fuckup really came through.  I‚Äôd kiss your bare ass if it wasn‚Äôt so nasty.‚Äù

Hardass and I parted on fairly good terms when time was growing short for both of us to leave.  He‚Äôd be rotating back Stateside before me.  He‚Äôd called me to his office:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be working with Camp Guard for the few weeks you have left, OP - keep you out of the field.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnh-unh!  No.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a beni, damn it!  Just standing post.‚Äù

I Hated standing post - most boring job in the world.  Would much rather be in the field with what few old friends still remained, most of the old crew having already left by then themselves.  Gary was gone.  Dog.  Larry.  Others.  It wasn‚Äôt the same - too many new faces. 

And I had no great love for Camp Guard personnel 
anyway.  

But The Count was still around.  Mason. Some others. 

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you get me out of it?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs comin‚Äô from the Captain!  For once can‚Äôt you just keep your damn mouth shut and do what you‚Äôre told?!‚Äù

Lol, impasse as we glared at each other, then I turned to go. 

‚ÄúOP.‚Äù  

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere you‚Äôre goin next - good luck, you hear me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou too.‚Äù

I flashed back to the worst dust-up he, I, and a couple of others had gotten into what seemed like a long time ago now.  Other incidents had been of lesser nature, usually.  With some exceptions. 

Not long afterward, he‚Äôd come to my cubicle:  ‚ÄúGet dressed.  We‚Äôre goin‚Äô to town.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo way.  Not after the last time.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, man!‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have the money.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Promise you won‚Äôt start no shit this time?‚Äù

I was still sore from that last adventure.  Various bruises and contusions still healing.  As was the busted lip.  Cut inside my mouth was coming along well.  But I hadn‚Äôt lost that molar after all.  

A non-commital look.  At least he was honest.  He was a foul-mouthed, mean drunk who didn‚Äôt even try to contain his more uncivilized tendencies.  I knew it.  He knew it.  We All knew it.  He was just about as mean when he wasn‚Äôt, for that matter. 

‚ÄúSure.  Why not?‚Äù

He cared little or none for rank.  Was insubordinate to a surprising degree.  And got away with it because he ran one of the most consistently highest performing platoons in the battalion.  

One with more than its share of unfortunate incidents of lack of discipline off-duty, as well, himself included, but it was sometimes that way.  

And nobody messed with His troops.  That was His job, lol, and he resented attempted intrusion.  But he saw to it that we had what we needed to do our jobs and to have good down time to the best of his ability, with what we had at that time.  

He never said where he‚Äôd found that old 8mm projector that time, so I still wonder how long it took for someone to discover it was missing, lol.  Just a handful of non-training films with it, but he‚Äôd said he‚Äôd work on that. 

The best Plt Sgt I worked with in ten years in.  There should have been more just like him.  

I was 19 when I knew him, and it came as a surprise some years later to remember that he himself was only 27.  He‚Äôd seemed older.  But 27 Is old to someone not yet 20.  

He‚Äôd be 72 years old now, if he‚Äôs still around. 

Old stories, and old memories.  But here‚Äôs to you, Hardass!  Bill.  It was quite a time.

We have a 2.5 year old son. My husband is a good man and a good dad. I find it hard to even admit that I consider divorce because he doesn‚Äôt deserve it. However, he is a very strict member of the church of Jesus Christ (Mormon) and comes from a very strict family as well. I was baptized into the church shortly after meeting him and at the time it felt like it was something I wanted to do and something I wanted to believe in. I come from a very dysfunctional family and thought maybe the secret to success was to be Mormon. I wanted to break my family‚Äôs cycles and believed to only way to guarantee that was marrying someone who would never be addicted to drugs, have sex with someone else, be abusive, etc. because of his commitment to God and his religion. I married him because he was a good man. Not because I was crazy in love with him. Fast forward years later, I learn more and more about the problematic origins of mormonism and realize I don‚Äôt align with all of its teachings or standards. That however is not really allowed in my situation. Saying I don‚Äôt believe in the church is considered a pure act of rebellion and going against God and being a poor influence to my son for things like drinking an occasional Starbucks coffee. We have had many discussions since originally telling him I had my doubts about the church and basically it sums up to our marriage will survive even if I don‚Äôt fully believe as long as I keep the church guidelines and standards and allow my kids to be fully raised in it. Which feels disingenuous to me. I also can‚Äôt brush off the fact I‚Äôve never truly felt like my husband was/is my best friend. We‚Äôve never had a spark or true chemistry. He is a respectful, caring, hard working, God fearing man and that seemed like reason enough for 21 year old me to marry him. I still highly value and appreciate those qualities but most days it feels like something‚Äôs missing and that our marriage is conditional upon me believing/practicing a certain religion. I see other marriages who look so happy and like they truly married their best friend and can‚Äôt help but think that‚Äôs something worth looking for. Of course getting a divorce would be the biggest riskiest decision of my life and I‚Äôm so afraid of how that will affect my son. How his whole family would hate me. And how I‚Äôm maybe repeating the family cycle I was trying so desperately to break. To say I‚Äôve been feeling lost is an understatement. I‚Äôd appreciate any thoughts? Thank you!

The financial means that derive from employment have a primary, baseline significance in the sense of one's ability to perform basic lifestyle tasks like using public transport, affording condoms, and affording to do simple and casual dates (i.e. tea, coffee, ice cream, yoghurt etc). The secondary level of significance comes from one's ability to engage in non-monogamy-specific lifestyle activities such as BDSM gear, sex toys, parties and workshops. In my personal experience interacting with non-monogamous folks, the latter doesn't come easy, especially with high costs of living.

I am 29, autistic, a cis het man, unemployed and living with my parents. I have Bachelors and Masters degrees in music. I am currently exploring the possibilities of becoming employed a librarian or piano tuner and getting off welfare. Dating in my early 20s was possible but did have it's fair share of limitations given that I didn't drive and I couldn't bring partners back to my home for sex. Practicing ethical non-monogamy to me, has consisted entirely of:

* casual hook ups
* attending sex parties (where single males could be admitted)
* seeing sex workers

It will be interesting to see whether employment and moving into another household would be  big gamechanger for me or whether it would have a slight, if negligible impact.",1,1737944690.0,EthicalNonMonogamy,10,0.57,False

I (F39) was approached by this person (M40) at the grocery store, which btw, was my dream scenario since I dislike dating apps and all the fakeness that comes with it, we started talking in the aisle for quite a long time until he invited me for coffee the same day, like an hour later. We did have coffee, talked for an hour or so, and I was pleasantly surprised because he talked (a lot, which I attributed to maybe nervousness, some pp get super talkative sometimes on a first ""date"" I don't know what other word to use even though it was not a proper date but wtv) about things that I am very into such as plant medicine and spirituality, amongst other stuff. I was really so so surprised, I was not expecting the guy to be so interesting and articulate. So I talked about my stuff too (martial arts and traditonal chinese medicine) and the convo was legit super nice. At the end he said we could start a nice friendship and I told him that I was down with that since I like to take my time and get to know the person. That all happened last Thursday. I had talked to him about a youtube channel and said I would text it to him so I did. Still on the same day but way later in the day (we met in the morning and I texted him at 5pm) he replied later (which is totally fine) at around 9 and said how he had a good time and how he was enchanted and thanked me and wished me good night.

Why am I doing this? Because why the fuck not? Also, all the mercs are canonically bisexual because I said so. Don't question me or I will sue you for defamation, lies, libel, slander, and the other thing.

# 1. Medic (Mastermind Horror Yandere - ""This is what I do to the people I love"")

Medic‚Äôs unhinged nature and obsession with his own twisted pursuits make him the ultimate ""scary yandere."" He wouldn't hesitate to use his medical knowledge to manipulate or even experiment on his beloved. Fuck, homeboy surgically implemented himself with 8 souls and then put a baboon uterus into Classic Heavy! This guy is fucked in the head and cannot be stopped. 

You talk to a guy and suddenly his eyes are replaced with octopus eyes and he's freaking out by seeing colors he never could before and dies from sensory overload. Another guy, you talk to him and he's pregnant with 15 pig babies and can't see you anymore. Then you walk up strapped to a table and prepped for surgery to have a ton of machinery put into you because ""This is what I do to the people I love.""

Yeah, Medic is the scariest mfer in TF2 and that is why he is the top tier Yandere.

# 2. Scout (Hotheaded Yandere - Extreme Jealousy and Possessiveness)

Scout tops the list as the quintessential hotheaded yandere. His brash arrogance, hyperactive personality, and over-the-top bravado make him a walking powder keg of jealousy and possessiveness. He makes his interest in you known IMMEDIATELY! You meet him and he instantly calls you hot and asks for a date. His fixation would lead to impulsive, often violent, displays of ""affection.""

You talk to another guy? That guy will NOT have a jaw the next day because he took a fucking baseball bat to it. You're talking to a Siri you set to have a male Bri'ish voice? Your phone is dead. He wakes you up at 4am to ask, ""EY EY! WHO DA FUCK IS ALAHM AND WHY DOES HE CALL YOU AT 7AM EVERY DAY!? HMM!?"" Scout would give you no room to breathe at all, thinking he is the best because, damn it, he is. (He was my main back in the day lmfao).

This all makes him a pretty damn good yandere. A suffocating force that gives you no damn room to breathe, but damn it you like being choked.

# 3. Pyro (Unaware Chaotic Yandere - Delusional and Dangerous)

Pyro is terrifying because he wouldn't even realize he‚Äôs a yandere. In his sugar-coated fantasy world, everything he does is ""for love,"" but the reality would be a fiery nightmare. His inability to distinguish reality from delusion makes him unpredictable and incredibly dangerous. He thinks he is giving you flowers and he's handing you a fucking bouquet of dynamite.

He thinks he is talking to the other guy you're talking to, but nah he's burning him alive. He thinks he's giving the OTHER guy you were talking to a lollipop but he was chopping his head off with a fucking axe. Pyro‚Äôs object of affection would likely be overwhelmed by the chaos he brings, making him one of the scariest yanderes in the lineup.

# 4. Soldier (Hotheaded Yandere - Passionate but Calmed by a Match)

Soldier aka Jane Doe is a damn war hero. Fighting in WWII long after it ended. He is intense with a warlike demeanor makes him a hotheaded yandere who would proudly and violently declare his affection. Yeah, like Scout. ""WOMAN!? YOU ARE ACCEPTABLE! YOU WILL BE MY WIFE!"" Is the first thing he says to you lmao.  
  
His obsession would be loud and direct, with over-the-top proclamations and extreme jealousy. ""I SAW YOU TALKING TO THAT BOY AT THE COFFEE SHOP! WHY ARE YOU GOING BEHIND MY BACK!? AM I NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU!?"" Because he saw you talking to the cashier... but-  
  
As we saw with Zhanna, Heavy's sister in the comics, he can be surprisingly grounded if he finds someone equally eccentric. This potential for balance keeps him from ranking higher, but his intensity remains undeniable. This because she was as intense as him. Even so, a mark against our good old Jane Doe.

# 5. Spy (Submissive Obsessive Yandere - Calculated and Romantic)

Spy‚Äôs suave, French, and romantic nature would translate into a methodical and obsessive yandere who would do anything to fuck your mom. Yes, not you, YOUR MOTHER. Spy's not a yandere for you, no no no. THAT WOULD BE YOUR MOTHER!  
  
His actions to fuck your mom would be cloaked in sophistication, with a veneer of charm hiding a deeply possessive streak. He‚Äôd manipulate situations from behind the scenes, ensuring your mom has no choice but to reciprocate. Sabotaging the dates she goes on, hacking her dating websites and tinder, and killing her lovers behind the scenes. But all with this idea of, ""I do it for love.""  
  
His calculating, cloak and dagger behavior makes for an honestly wonderful and intimidating yandere who hides behind the shadow. His romantic veneer all just adding to it. Your mom would never see him coming.

# 6. Engineer (Isolating Yandere - Overbearing but Well-Meaning)

Engineer‚Äôs quiet, soft-spoken demeanor hides a suffocating level of affection. A good ol' boy from Texas. He‚Äôd obsessively try to ""help"" his beloved, often with mechanical creations that ultimately complicate things. All his good intentions leading him down a bad road.  
  
While not overtly violent or terrifying, his relentless attempts to be indispensable would leave little room for personal space. His obsessive tendencies would stem from a desire to make life easier, but they‚Äôd quickly spiral into overwhelming codependency.

He basically does a yandere all by accident. Creating situations which, due to his machines, isolates you to him. Making him all that you rely on. Making him the only person you can go to when anything is needed. This, as such, marks him down some points for me.

# 7. Heavy (Very Submissive Yandere)

Heavy‚Äôs calm and level-headed personality would make him a surprisingly mild yandere. His obsession would manifest in protective behaviors, ensuring his beloved is always safe and cared for. While his size and strength could be intimidating, Heavy‚Äôs actions would likely lean more toward quiet devotion than overt aggression.  
  
Heavy would very likely jut be a run of the mill stalker. Watching you from afar and following you, but never directly intervening with you. Never stepping in to fight other lovers, never killing anyone, or doing anything insane. You just being there is enough for him. All you need to do to make Heavy happy is exist.  
  
This restraint places him lower on the list despite his potential, but adds a certain flavor to him. Mmm, is that... the bay leaf?

# 8. Demoman (Hotheaded Yandere - Passionate but Easily Doused)

Demoman‚Äôs fiery passion could make him a compelling yandere, but his penchant for drinking tempers his intensity. His obsession would flare up in moments of jealousy, but it wouldn‚Äôt sustain itself. His generally chill demeanor and occasional self-doubt make him less likely to fully embody the yandere archetype, despite his moments of fervor.

Plus, dude is loaded and the comics show he's actually like pretty chill, so I see him as having even less potential than Heavy because he'd likely forget about you in a night of drinking as he forgot many other things. As Demoman himself would say of my ranking of him, ""Ay, fair enough.""

# 9. Sniper (Conflicted Yandere - Suppressed Emotions and Duty)

As Sniper himself once said, ""Feelings are for blokes who bludgeon their wife to death."" So uh... hmph, yeah.  
  
Sniper‚Äôs stoic and professional nature makes him the least likely to become a yandere. His reserved personality and strict adherence to discipline would conflict with obsessive tendencies. While a deep internal struggle between duty and obsession could create compelling drama such as him having to conflict with these feelings mucking up his work, his emotional suppression and lack of lore about romantic interests leave him at the bottom of the ranking.

# Final Ranking Summary:

1. Scout
2. Medic
3. Pyro
4. Soldier
5. Spy
6. Engineer
7. Heavy
8. Demoman
9. Sniper

1iax60e,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1iax60e/rf_wants_grace_paley/,[Rf] ‚ÄúWants‚Äù Grace Paley,"Hi,

I‚Äôm new to literature and poetry (4yrs in). I read this short story and wondered what ideas others have. 

‚ÄúWants‚Äù
by
Grace Paley
I saw my ex-husband in the street. I was sitting on the steps of the new library.
Hello, my life, I said. We had once been married for twenty-seven years, so I felt
justified.
He said, What? What life? No life of mine.
I said, O.K. I don‚Äôt argue when there‚Äôs real disagreement. I got up and went into
the library to see how much I owed them.
The librarian said $32 even and you‚Äôve owed it for eighteen years. I didn‚Äôt deny
anything. Because I don‚Äôt understand how time passes. I have had those books. I
have often thought of them. The library is only two blocks away.
My ex-husband followed me to the Books Returned desk. He interrupted the
librarian, who had more to tell. In many ways, he said, as I look back, I attribute
the dissolution of our marriage to the fact that you never invited the Bertrams to
dinner.
That‚Äôs possible, I said. But really, if you remember: first, my father was sick that
Friday, then the children were born, then I had those Tuesday-night meetings,
then the war began.Then we didn‚Äôt seem to know them any more. But you‚Äôre
right. I should have had them to dinner.
I gave the librarian a check for $32. Immediately she trusted me, put my past
behind her, wiped the record clean, which is just what most other municipal
and/or state bureaucracies will not do.
I checked out the two Edith Wharton books I had just returned because I‚Äôd read
them so long ago and they are more apropos now than ever. They were The
House of Mirth and The Children, which is about how life in the United States in
New York changed in twenty-seven years fifty years ago.
A nice thing I do remember is breakfast, my ex-husband said. I was surprised. All
we ever had was coffee. Then I remembered there was a hole in the back of the
kitchen closet which opened into the apartment next door. There, they always ate
sugar-cured smoked bacon. It gave us a very grand feeling about breakfast, but
we never got stuffed and sluggish.
That was when we were poor, I said.
When were we ever rich? he asked.
Oh, as time went on, as our responsibilities increased, we didn‚Äôt go in need. You
took adequate financial care, I reminded him. The children went to camp four
weeks a year and in decent ponchos with sleeping bags and boots, just like
everyone else. They looked very nice. Our place was warm in winter, and we had
nice red pillows and things.
I wanted a sailboat, he said. But you didn‚Äôt want anything.
Don‚Äôt be bitter, I said. It‚Äôs never too late.
No, he said with a great deal of bitterness. I may get a sailboat. As a matter of
fact I have money down on an eighteen-foot two-rigger. I‚Äôm doing well this year
and can look forward to better. But as for you, it‚Äôs too late. You‚Äôll always want
nothing.
He had had a habit throughout the twenty-seven years of making a narrow
remark which, like a plumber‚Äôs snake, could work its way through the ear down
the throat, half-way to my heart. He would then disappear, leaving me choking
with equipment. What I mean is, I sat down on the library steps and he went
away.
I looked through The House of Mirth, but lost interest. I felt extremely accused.
Now, it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm short of requests and absolute requirements. But I do
want something.
I want, for instance, to be a different person. I want to be the woman who brings
these two books back in two weeks. I want to be the effective citizen who
changes the school system and addresses the Board of Estimate on the troubles
of this dear urban center.
I had promised my children to end the war before they grew up.
I wanted to have been married forever to one person, my ex-husband or my
present one. Either has enough character for a whole life, which as it turns out is
really not such a long time. You couldn‚Äôt exhaust either man‚Äôs qualities or get
under the rock of his reasons in one short life.
Just this morning I looked out the window to watch the street for a while and saw
that the little sycamores the city had dreamily planted a couple of years before
the kids were born had come that day to the prime of their lives.
Well! I decided to bring those two books back to the library. Which proves that
when a person or an event comes along to jolt or appraise me I can take some
appropriate action, although I am better known for my hospitable remark.",1,1737944071.0,shortstories,0,1.0,False

1iax5og,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1iax5og/my_best_friend_and_exboyfriend_is_sending_mixed/,My best friend and Ex-Boyfriend is sending mixed signals,"It's been about 3 months since the break up. It's still a roller coaster for me. He's started a new job after his temp job he got after he was let go, he seems to be much happier at this job. I was and still hope that we can eventually get back to where we were before we started dating, we would hang out just about every week, but since the break up we've been lucky if it's once a month. He's not very responsive by text anymore but he did say that he's started working on himself again (exercising, lifting, etc.).

I've outlined in my previous post some of the mixed signals when he and I had Coffee after the breakup. Since then he's sent many more mixed signals and a lot of things have happened too.A couple weeks after I had had a rough week (certain family things had happened). When those things were happening I was texting with him that evening and wrote that I may need someone to talk to. He called out of the blue to talk but I had to tell him that due to reasons I couldn't talk about it that night. When I finally went to bed he texted me ""Good night 'beautiful'"". Beautiful was written in a foreign language I learned in college and that he ""hates"" when I speak it around him. But he always ""gets back"" at me by butchering his pronunciation. But he spelled it correctly accent mark and all, not to mention a word I've never used around him. At coffee I had told him a phrase in that language to describe how I feel about him (not love but more than a simple best friend), and how to me certain phrases in that language may seem simple in English but have a more meaningful meaning in the other language. So him calling me ""beautiful"" something only ever used while we were dating messed with me a bit.

When he and I hung out soon after that (first time at his place since the break up) he got on the floor while I was playing with his cat and pulled me in for a brief cuddle and asked what had happened that week (the family thing), so I told him (as I was able to). After that he asked if I wanted to cuddle in his room. While we dated I was always the one ""in his arms"" the ""sub"", the ""little spoon"" even though I'm much taller. I was also the one that almost always asked to cuddle (going to sleep together, and sex excluded). But he was in my arms that time, and I could see some conflict in his eyes.

Fast forward and he goes on a brief week long vacation with family, and one night he texts that he had a good day drank quite a bit (I wouldn't say drunk, but a little intoxicated) and now just wants ""cuddles and a nap"". Then called soon after. At which point he says jokingly ""could you teleport here"".

Then Christmas day he called when he got back from work so like 2am left me a voicemail and the part that has caused some conflict is where he said ""... Thinking about You ... Um ... Have a good day"". It was a very pregnant pause of wanting to say something more but not.

Then the next time we hung out at my place we went back to my room, to have some privacy and he laid right on my bed taking up the whole bed and wanted to cuddle again. Again it was mostly him in my arms, I then finally told him somethings that I needed to say about past feelings, he then told me about shit he went through with his ex-fiance (a woman, he's bi, I'm gay). The gist of what he told me is that he broke it off because she was manipulative and mean. Later she tried to get back into his life, but soon was being manipulative to him again, he ended contact again, and how ever long later tried to come back into his life, he confronted her and asked ""do you actually want to be friends, or be manipulative and play the blame game again"" she showed her true colors again and he said that he yelled at her over the phone louder that he's yelled at anyone else in his life. He's a big guy, some may even call intimidating, but is a huge teddy bear inside, so it would take a lot to make him lose his temper.

While at my place we started wrestling and ""rough housing"", near the end he put my hand around his neck and squeezed it a little. While we were dating he was always the one that would ""choke"" me, let me be clear that it's never been hard enough to cause me to pass out, enough to get that natural reaction of a little bit of fear. But I'd never done that to him. He also jokingly implied that he was a ""bucket list item"" to me.

The most recent time we hung out, after a movie, he asked if I wanted to stay while he got ready for work or leave I said I'd stay and he then took one of the longest showers I've ever known. When we left and I was driving him to his car he said how Y (his friend and an ex, who I've met before, and while he and I were dating had thought they had dated in the past, was confirmed after the break up) and I are only friends. Then later said ""I'm glad you stayed while I showered, I don't normally take such a long shower, and feel vulnerable when I do"".

Just recently I asked him if we could cuddle some the next time we hangout and he said that he doesn't want to do that.

I now want to give a little bit more history on him for full context of my thoughts. Besides his nightmare of a ex-fiance, he dated a woman after that, someone that he'd been friends with years before. They had a fairly serious relationship then one day out of the blue things happened, it ended, and that relationship really ""damaged"" him. From there he's had at least a few other women that he's dated. Most if not all it sounds like he ended most on the basis of ""not feeling love"" for them. One of them he had been friends with previously as well and that blew up in spectacular fashion when she texted him a novel of pretty much ""everything I hate about you"". Leading up to us dating he had told me that he's lost some other friends too recently and that he can't afford to lose another, he had me ""promise"" that if anything bugs me about him that I would tell him and not bottle it up.

I feel that he still has feelings for me, and that he ""self sabotaged"" the dating relationship out of fear of losing me ie if he let it go longer and then something happened and our friendship ending the same as the others. My normal therapist somewhat agrees, has expressed how what I've said shows that he appears to have had a lot of ""trauma"" in his previous relationships. Of course I haven't gone into full detail here for privacy reasons. But many times since the break up I feel he's done the opposite of what most ""ex's"" would do. As for him saying that us dating was a ""bucket list item"" to me I feel he may have said that out of insecurity in himself and wanting to ""downgrade"" the relationship. He never has and never will be, he means to much to me to be a simple item on a list.

I'd like to hear what others thoughts are on this. I don't want anything similar to what one of my friends said, who pretty much said ""drop him like a hot rock"". I can't and won't, but something like give it more space go back to strictly just friends, or similar is welcome. But the biggest thing I need is thoughts on what others think, am I ""right"", ""wrong"", over thinking it, does it seem realistic that there is trauma (I think it's pretty obvious), does it seem realistic that someone may do what he's doing because he's ""scared"".

I also want to ask him directly if he feels it may progress to something more again, tell him that he doesn't need to give me detail but that a simple yes, maybe, i don't know, or no would work. And tell him that if it's a no I'm fine with that, but that if it is I can't have him changing his mind later, that I wouldn't be able to emotionally handle that, if it's a no I need to start to ""close"" that door / chapter. But that if it's any of the others I won't wait forever but I would respect his feelings and wait some time for him. I need to ask him so I know what expect at this point, is this him still showing feelings, or is this just him wanting to ""have fun"", I'm ok with that but I don't do good with the ""unknown"".

I know what I think, what my therapist thinks, and some of my friends think, but I tend to get caught up in my head, and just need to hear from the aether that is the internet and Reddit.
