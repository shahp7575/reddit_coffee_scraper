Once they dropped the new album I had 2,500 min of listening, but come the end of summer I hadn’t listened to them.

The dream was 2 nights ago and for some reason I was in a mall with Josh and Tyler, I was super excited and all I wanted to do was talk them especially about Josh and tips on drumming and Tyler about just normal things. 
 (I’m going to explain it in a way so my post doesn’t get taken down) out of nowhere a man started using a harmful tool🔫 in the mall and Tyler went night night. (Imagine me saying this very graphically because that is what it was)

Josh was fine, but mentally he wasn’t. I Ran out of the mall with Josh, and Tyler was in his arms. I just curled up on the ground in disbelief and shock. I woke up in a sweat and went about my day and went to work. I still think about it though and how graphic it was. I have a feeling it’s because I had 2 cups of coffee right before I went to bed that night

It’s just weird I had that dream when I haven’t listened to them in a bit ",1,1738735958.0,twentyonepilots,1,1.0,False

 \- once when I decided that instead of taking the scholarship I had earned to grad school, I would find a job teaching in another country instead

 \- once when, a few months after starting that job, I decided to send a postcard to a guy that I had a secret crush on for 2 years during uni but never told. The guy in question had graduated 3 years before, married, and moved away, and I only had his address because I had been in charge of sending his family a baby gift 6 months prior.

 \- once when I decided that I wanted to move back to my home state after 10 years of living across the country, just because now

All three times those decisions not only ended being good ones - they were life-changing. If I hadn't moved to the new country to teach, I would not have sent that postcard, and if I hadn't done that, the guy wouldn't have become my best friend for 10 years, I wouldn't have moved to California to be closer to him, and wouldn't have met my husband. If we hadn't moved back to my home state, I would have missed the last 2 years of my mom's life before she was suddenly diagnosed with terminal cancer and died quite young.

Now I am having this crazy compulsion to ask a guy out for coffee (as a FRIEND - I am still married) who is an acquaintance at best and very, very likely to say no. I honestly feel like I already know him, although I don't, and keep wondering why this feels so necessary.",1,1738735934.0,DoesAnybodyElse,0,1.0,False

1ii3m9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/PLL_Ezria/comments/1ii3m9r/rewatch_tuesday_1x02_the_jenna_thing/,Rewatch Tuesday 1X02 The Jenna Thing,"Rewatch Tuesday! Tonight, it's 1x2 The Jenna thing! Jenna has arrived back in Rosewood.



The girls sitting at The Grille after Alison's funeral. Even though we sort of knew Emily's secret - the way she was like ""I knew she was keeping something from me- form us."" I know she's not ready to admit it to the girls, but it was cute how she did that. and I'm loving how they're reminiscing about Ali and the hot pool lifeguard ""Save me!"" Now Jenna's walking into The Grille.



Now we see the Marin girls getting ready for their day, I'm surprised Ashley let the tv play as long as she did, letting Hanna hear what caused Ali's death. Now onto the Mongomery clan - what confuses me is Ella talks about seeing Hanna's funeral dress - yet we didn't see her or Byron at the funeral, of course there could've been a burial that we just didn't see since the pilot ended still in daytime and The Jenna Things starts at night. Also really Byron did you really think ""Demanding students"" was a smart thing to say when you're hiding the fact you cheated on your wife

  
Love how they added the nod to the books with Aria calling Ella by her name. Kinda, wish they kept it in a little more.

  
Love how the first thing Maya says to Emily is ""Are you okay?"" she's so gentle with Emily. Of course, I feel Maya is flirting with Emily but Emily not really realizing it or not flirting back, either way it's so sweet. Ohhhh Pam unknowingly pushing Emaya together.  But oh my god  ""New girl moves into dead girl's house."" not the right crowd Maya but it was a little funny to me

  
Seriously what time does their school start? when I was in HS, classes started at 7:45 - I didn't have time to practice field hockey or get a coffee (I wasn't drinking it yet but still) - I probably barely had time to eat breakfast but either these people start their day at 5AM (unlikely with Hanna she doesn't seem like a up at 5am girl)



This scene between Aria and Ezra is so soft and gentle IMO. The way he says he can handle his feelings but then she says she can't but even if she could she didn't want to. Honestly this scene with her saying that is partly why I feel the writers should've had Ezria separate until Ezra got the job at Hollis. But seriously I feel Hanna knew something happened/was happening beween Aria and Ezra because when Aria walked out of his classroom Ezra was watching after her and I feel the way Hanna was looking at them/Ezra she knew. I'm not even going to talk about Emily's BF.



""Dead Girls walking -A'



  
Stupid freaking Wilden - that's all I have to say about him. Now Jenna's back and she gives this creepy vibe. She brought the girls to silence and into the flashback of the night of the Jenna thing. I've seen a lot of people talk about how they believe Alison had blinded Jenna on purpose. Watching this flashback I'm starting to really believe that. She's so set on saying no one was in there and that it was Toby.  She literally looked around and I feel she saw/knew that Jenna was in there that why she shut the door after a few moments AFTER tossing it - why not look then light/toss? Tammin Sursok did such an amazing job with Jenna. 



  
I always thought Mona transferred into Ezra's class in The Jenna thing but I think I had just assumed that. Because she didn't give him a transfer paper or anything - but she didn't when she walked in late to class. Still not fully sure because she calls him Fritz not Fitz but she was in his class in the pilot. But Aria comes and gives him the declined transfer request.



  
Hanna and Sean were cute, but I honestly feel like Sean didn't like/love Hanna meant when she asked him ""You do like me like that right?"" after he turned her down. I feel he said yes way to hard and fast. I understand him wanting to wait, but I also see Hanna's pov - not condoning her behavior at all. They should have broken up instead of being together as long as they were. Of course, Peter is ignoring Spencer - no wonder she ordered a vodka soda. Not much of a Sparia scene - since Spencer said she was going to email Aria when she got home I'm guessing they're not texting much since they're still being used to being in each other lives again or something. I swear baby Emaya is so cute. Maya being gentle and flirty with Emily 💖!!! 



Now that we're seeing more of Spencer's dad -it's pretty obvious they favor Melissa. Wren is giving Spencer alcohol yet Peter and Melissa are absorbed in their own little banter. I will say I like how how Wren saved Spencer by going for High/low before her seeing how she was struggling with.  Melissa being snobby by saying he's just kidding when Wren said his high was getting a parking spot right in front of the Chem lab - Melissa your fiance clearly doesn't know how the game works he was just thrown into it WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS and everyone isn't going to have the same high as you. 



  
CLOCK HIM MAYA CLOCK HIM HANNA

This scene between Emily and Pam is so sweet, of course Emily's talking about her feelings for Ali/Maya and Pam just thinks its about missing Ali but she was being so supportive of Emily's feelings about Ali being gone.



  
Ugh - Wren go away. Now I understand he's a med student but seriously he's making sure no ones coming or around before offering to give her another shoulder rub. I've seen people bash on Spencer for getting with Wren/Ian - who were adults. Should Spencer have known better than to flirt with/kiss Wren as he was Melissa's fiance? Yes. But it was still on Wren to not do that. He was the adult yet people wanna bash on Spencer. Yes I think Ezra should have done the same thing with Aria until he was able to not be her teacher \*Hollis/any other HS\* WREN STOP FLIRTING WITH YOUR FIANCEE'S SISTER. If only Melissa stayed a few more moments then she would've seen Spencer back off and say its not right - while Wren was going to keep kissing her.



Now we're at Ezria's rain car scene - I feel like rain is definitely their weather. Emily's flashback of when Ali gave the girls the bracelets. I love the scene as it bonds the girls more. Aria and Byron really need this talk but Byron should be having it with Ella and admit what he did.



Seeing Jenna turn her head at Spencer is so creepy - it feels like she can see Spencer. I've heard - not sure if its true or saying that this is true - blind people's senses are stronger so maybe it was that. But it was just so creepy which why I love Tammin Sursok for the role of Jenna. I don't think anyone else could play her any better - Jenna Ortega could probably tie but Tammin was definitely the best choice in 2009/2010



  
Sorry this is even later - I'll do better next week. See you next week for 1x3 To Kill a Mocking Girl

I currently live with my parents. The root of the issue is my dad thinks I am a selfish, ungrateful brat. He thinks this because of the following reasons:

-I've only sent them enough money for my rent and replacing the stuff that was ruined by my girlfriend's cats pissing on them, and then spent the rest of the money I had on getting myself things that I enjoy

- I lied about doing schoolwork last semester and have failed all of my classes

- I need to be asked for help when they need help, instead of proactively seeing it and helping without being asked

-I don't go above and beyond what they've asked of me. I don't do more than The dishes, taking the garbage out, and cleaning the cat litter

For more context: I moved back in with them last year with my girlfriend after I lost my job. With us were 3 cats. It took me a while to find a job, and I started school partially to get student loans to help pay rent, since my dad lost his job around the same time I left my last long term job. As of right now, I have sent them a total of nearly 22,000 in rent payments and paying them back for the stuff they had to replace, for the last year. They claim that they've spent upwards of 30-40,000(the number gets bigger everytime my dad brings it up) on me and my girlfriend. My girlfriend no longer lives with us and has moved back to her parents, after a falling out in which she was venting to her dad about the difficulties of living with my parents, which resulted in a verbal argument between her dad and mine, which resulted in her being kicked out. The argument started over fucking coffee. 
My mind is very disjointed, so it's hard to keep things clear. Any opinions are appreciated.

1ii3aa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Haunted/comments/1ii3aa7/the_bedroom_animositypart_1/,The bedroom animosity-part 1,"I have had the same room since I was 3-4 years old, and nothing weird happened until years later. In those years, a lot happened: disagreements, fights, and divorce. My parents' divorce led to me mainly living at my mom’s place but going to my dad’s on the weekend. At this point, I could have been 8-9 years old. To add to the story, another person would regularly come over on the weekends: my cousin.  My cousin was younger by just one year, and that closeness in age made us close and being able to play every weekend at my dad's house made us even closer. We would play Barbies all night in the basement, Assembling different “rooms” and just having fun until we got tired. The darkness in the house did not scare us before, at least not before this. This night was like any other weekend; we had been playing with our Barbies all night; at this point, it had to be in the A.M.s, and we were tired. We decided to sleep in my room since that was where the bed was; I mean, duh. We started to put enough stuff away not to get my dad mad at us, but enough out so we didn't have to reassemble everything the following morning; when we were done, we decided to leave. We went upstairs, talking about what we would do the next morning with no care; we soon were in my room and were so tired. So when my cousin stayed over, we had to do something, which was to have some sort of light for my cousin since she was scared of the dark when it was time to sleep. At times, we decided to leave the light in the closet on and a light connected to the head of the bed. we then got in the bed, ready to sleep. I started getting comfortable, my eyes closed, and suddenly, I heard some breathing. my eyes opened, startled by this; it couldn’t be my cousin. I immediately called out my cousin’s name. “E, are you hearing that?” she whispered, “Yes,” This breathing seemed to be the loudest thing in the room as if someone was taking deep breaths and exhaling loudly. It didn’t have a particular place it had come from, it seemed to be everywhere. After a minute, I whispered back to my cousin, “What if we go to my dad’s room and tell him?” a few seconds passed, and she answered, “Okay.” “Okay, let's go now!” I lounged out of bed and ran out of my room with my cousin behind me. we went into my dad's room, and as a result, we bolted out of his bed, looking at us with a worried look. “What happened? Why are you guys waking me up when it's still dark outside?” My cousin and I were trying to explain, but once we calmed down enough, I explained to my dad, “ We were sleeping, or at least trying, when all of a sudden we heard deep breathing, but it sounded like a man breathing.” my dad looked at us confused, but walked with us to my room. We looked at him and waited for him to answer us. We stood there in silence; there was no sound in the house; my dad broke that silence, “It must have been the wind; you might have also imagined it. If anything, go to sleep.” he left the room while closing the door, and once again it was just me and her in there. We got into the bed and went to sleep. This reoccurrence would happen every time we stayed at my dad's house. This could have lasted for a year if I remember correctly. My cousin and I remembered this years later and laughed about it, not in a way where we genuinely found this funny, but in a way where we had no answer to those events and just had to laugh. Later, I talked to my dad about other funny stories from my childhood when I brought this up. His face immediately became stone cold, “Oh yeah, I remember.” I looked at him, perplexed at how he was more bothered by this than me or even my cousin, which we would joke about at this point. “Why are you reacting like that if it didn't happen to you?” I laughed. He looked away and explained, “ I believed you guys.” You seem to forget that I live alone in that house, see five days a week and seven overall. I know what happens in this house.” There was a pause, and he looked back at me. “Was I supposed to look at two little girls who were scared that they were right and that something was breathing in the room they were staying at? No, I couldn’t.” I looked at him now, surprised that he was saying that. At this point, my cousin and I had fought everyone, and these events had happened to us before. My dad kept saying, “I had called a friend after you guys left. (This friend was an individual intertwined with some spiritual stuff.) They had told me to cleanse your room and the entrance.” I stared with my mouth open, surprised he would admit this now. He made himself a coffee and left me with questions and answers. overall, maybe I wasn't as crazy as I initially thought.",1,1738734541.0,Haunted,0,1.0,False

Okay, hear me out. I know this sounds insane, but I swear it was an accident.  

So my roommate (let’s call him Dave) is super into collecting weird antiques. A few months ago, he bought this old, creepy-looking wooden box from a flea market because, in his words, “It has character.” He put it on our coffee table, and honestly, I was just sick of looking at it. It gave me bad vibes.  

Last week, I was cleaning the apartment and decided to sell some stuff on Facebook Marketplace. I took a bunch of photos of random things and listed them—an old DS, a jacket I've never worn, *and the stupid wooden box*. Someone messaged me about it almost instantly, asking a bunch of weirdly specific questions:  

- “Has the contract been activated?”  
- “Did you open it under a full moon?”  
- “Is the previous owner still… around?”  

At this point, I assumed they were just a superstitious collector and played along. They Venmo’d me **$500** (which is insane for a dusty old box), so I did what any rational person would do—I took the money and dropped it off at their requested meetup spot. No big deal, right?  

Fast forward to last night. Dave comes home, looks at the coffee table, and **immediately** freaks out. Apparently, he wasn’t just “collecting” the box—he was using it for some kind of personal protection ritual. Something about a **soul contract** and binding energy? I don’t know, I kind of blacked out from panic.  

Now, Dave says he’s been having horrible nightmares and feeling “unsettled,” and I don’t know how to tell him that I **may or may not have sold his soul to a stranger on the internet**.  

 What do I do? Should I come clean? Should I try to get it back? Or should I move out before whatever he was “binding” comes looking for me instead?",1,1738734213.0,Advice,0,0.67,False

I’m a 40 year old male in ga and girlfriend is 39. She has 2 kids and I have one. No kids were there during this incident. Tuesday, December 17 of last year I received a message from my girlfriend at 4:03 PM while I was at work saying I am having a pretty mental health day. I know this would lead to a bad situation based on our times before so after work, I planned on finishing up Christmas shopping. I wanted to call her to be sure we got everything but I didn’t call because kids were there until about 7 and didn’t want them to hear us talking about it plus her having a bad mental health situation. I was just going to talk once I got back home upon returning home about 730 she asked why did I not respond to her message and I stated what message I then noticed on the way back home She sent a message saying I’ll leave you alone, but can you please tell me what have I done wrong? I told her who said you did anything wrong? what is wrong with you just tell me she stated I told you I’m having a bad mental health day and you should have came home and checked on me first. 

I told her that the kids were here so I know you would be OK until I got back and I will see what’s wrong. The conversation got heated, so I laid down to sleep. She got up, went into the kitchen, came back into The room and got into the bed with a bottle of pills and sat there Crying. I asked what are you doing with those and why are you crying? She said it doesn’t matter anyway I got up and went to sleep in the kids room because if I’m asking what’s wrong then tell me instead of that. I woke up about 630 next morning, expecting her to be at work already, but she was still there and we didn’t speak and I made my coffee and went to my car to smoke a cigar she left for work sometime after 7:25 AM which she usually leaves around 4:30 am. 

same morning I got message saying I love you and always will. I’m sorry I messed your life up. I should have ran a long time ago. I replied stop messaging me with the BS. You want to do negativity then you can I won’t. I just paid the mortgage. Why not let me use the money to get my own place you sit around and take for me knowing you should have ran is selfish and leave me alone. at 10:56 AM She sends message saying she is quitting her job and I asked what does that have to do with me. She said never mind. I finish my day up at work and head home. Even though I had more Xmas shopping to do but I learned from day before. I got home around 5:30 PM and she is on the couch. Things are scattered around in the garage and kitchen. I asked what happened why is she laying on the couch in fetal position and she is slurring words? She stated she kept falling coming in and knocked over things and that the paramedics were called by her mother because her daughter called her grandma bc she  was concerned with her, not being able to fully walk and falling down. She said she refused help and they left. 

I asked why you quit your job and she said her boss was being mean because she couldn’t work she couldn’t walk so she laid down in the back room all day and kept falling. I asked did you take those pills to try and kill yourself she said yes I wasn’t supposed to wake up. I was pissed but I still didn’t believe she took a whole bottle when she drove to work and back that day. I said come on get into bed. I’ll help her get up and she kept falling to her knees, staggering over and over and collapsed again in front of the bed. A total of 3 times before we made it to the room. 

I helped her get undressed and put her in bed as I went to the kitchen. I begin to pick up items off the stove top that were scattered from her earlier when she tossed her purse on stove and everything fell out, I noticed a letter and I read it. It was a suicide note written to me, her daughter and son also her brother and sister-in-law number stating not to release medical records to them. That’s when I put 2n2 together and realized it was a suicide note. while reading it I hear her stumbling around in the room, trying to make her way back up the hall I help her come to the kitchen. I asked her about the letter and I said I was gonna call your brother and see what he wants me to do. She said give me the letter and She then charged me going for the letter. I had it in one hand and keeping her from getting it. She begins to hit me with both hands and chest body and face. I’m holding her with one hand by bathrobe. She keeps falling down because she is weak from pills when she is down, she kicks me in my legs, punching me in my private area and yelling. I’m gonna call the cops I told her she says I don’t care. She bites me multiple times on hand and arm police took photos the day I got taken to jail. I’m shoving her away and I finally let the letter go and she grabs it and tries to walk down the hall and falls again while on the floor she starts to rip the letter up so I don’t have proof to show police or her brother. 
 
I try and help her get off the floor and she says it’s leave me alone she gets up and say I’m leaving grab keys and purse goes to car. I tell her don’t drive. I cut off car saying stop and come in. She doesn’t want to but she lost her phone in the house so that’s why she didn’t pull off. she was only wearing a robe bra and underwear. 

I told her if something happens to you I couldn’t live with that on my heart. We walk back in and still fall before we get to the room and we laid down together. I wake up for work Thursday morning and she is in bed at 6:30 AM with food smeared in bed so she got up while I was asleep but couldn’t eat properly because of all the pills so apparently she got up in the middle of the night to eat. her daughter walks in and checks on her. She comes over about 6:00 AM on days when she’s with her dad to catch the bus. She didn’t even know what day it was and was supposed to be working but was three hours late she called her boss and said I took a pill and I couldn’t wake up on time. Her daughter and I made some jokes about food being in bed. Her daughter leaves for school and i talked about What else should I get from the store for groceries after work which is a Thursday and I always buy groceries on those days and ask about the gifts for Christmas, we talk a little bit, but she is still out of it better than days before but she is still feeling it. I asked her why she wanted to kill herself and she said life and why did I not take the pills from her. I didn’t because she needs them so I won’t just take them and dump them and at that moment I wouldn’t think she would take all those to harm herself. Because when I asked her why she had them Tuesday night she said she needed to take one but was scared she may over sleep. 

I asked do you want me to take away every sharp thing out the house and dump all the pills you would be mad at me about that, why kill yourself here and risk kids finding your body or me before I left I said if you want to kill yourself then go ahead because I can’t stop it. I go to work in a few hours later. I’ll send a message to check on her and no response. I’ll call eight times. No answer. I couldn’t leave work because of blackout time. I assume she is still upset. I get home about 5:30 and she was gone and I noticed her half of my daughter’s Xmas gifts were gone that she bought. I called again no answer so I went into the trash to get the note she ripped with her brother‘s number and call him to ask for help and what should I do within minutes police pull up and arrest me sheriff and police. The arrest warrant was read to me at the sheriffs office and it stated I grabbed her by her ankles, pulling her and caused her to scrape knees, which wasn’t true days leading up to this she was crashing to her knees because she couldn’t stand and walk times before she would just collapse because of POTS, which she had said it caused her to pass out and have seizures when standing up too fast or increased heart rate, she has woken up with bruises and scratches on her from fighting herself in her sleep or scratching hard, certain meds she takes causes bruising for some reason and she doesn’t even know why. I did notice some marks around her neck area that could have been caused by me holding her robe by the neck area during their attack, and if I caused those then I accept those she has a history of mental health issues being admitted to the hospital before she met me since being together, she has tried to harm herself from cutting her wrist and I was scared to get help because she is scared her ex will take the kids and because he has money and close with the police. She is worried that will happen. She has been emotionally unstable and violent from throwing and breaking things to self harm, threatening me and Herself.

I spend the night in jail. Paid 2000 to get out. We have stay away in place. Had bond review Jan 15th and judge and DA believes it should stay in place. She admitted I did none of those in the police report and she was so doped up she doesn’t know why but she was scared I was gonna call police, tell 17 year old daughter and her brother. So she tried to get me. We have talked since and been around each other even though we shouldn’t. But I do love her and I know she loves me and the kids love one another. She tried to go get charges dropped the same day actually but it’s not up to her. At the review she told the judge the truth and all he said “sounds like it’s all your fault and not his” which it isn’t. So I know they don’t care. The worst I did was not come home Tuesday after work to check on her but I had my reason. 

I don’t have the funds for a lawyer and I still pay bills at our home but I’m not allowed there. If I go to trial I know they will throw the book at me. First offense, no criminal record. Even she went to DA office again but they don’t want to hear it. Arraignment isn’t until April and it’s killing us not being together and the kids. Then who knows when trial will start. I do not want to cop out to anything I didn’t do and she doesn’t either but we want to be together. 

I just need advice on what to do and just any help as needed. The only photos they have was extremely bruised knees and that’s because she was falling at work, and at home. And one scratch on neck which is on police report. Please help me!! ",1,1738734082.0,LegalAdviceMatters,0,1.0,False

I’m on day 4 of Prozac, and I’m in the rough side effect phase. Right now, I feel really jittery—almost like I’ve had a little too much coffee—and I’m experiencing a lot of panic attacks. I started it for depression and OCD, but I have pretty intense anxiety about taking new medications, which has made this even harder.

I was really hoping for relief, but with these side effects, I’m stuck in the “Did I make the right decision?” phase. I know it can take time, but right now, it’s tough.

1ii356d,https://www.reddit.com/r/VillainyGroup/comments/1ii356d/the_villainous_biscuit/,The Villainous Biscuit,">'Tis a rare moment for me to decry the value of a biscuit. The sugary goodness of a chocolate-topped morsel of the baker's endeavour is frequently a component of the better part of an otherwise uneventful day.

In this case, however, said biscuit was almost my undoing.

I have recently discovered a TV series called The Goes Wrong Show (2019) of which, the premise is simple. A stage play, performed by luckless and inadequate actors, staged on sets built by simpletons, in front of a studio audience. Everything does, indeed, go wrong.

I decided that I would sit down and watch this show - which had good reviews - with a cup of coffee (the elixir of the gods) and a toffee-pop biscuit.

>Just one, because my wife has set me limits, and I dare not go against her wishes. OK, two, but only ironically. Perhaps a third to help the other two go down. But three is a prime number, so a fourth to round things out. OK, a whole packet. SHUT UP! Don't judge me.

The show began. The coffee was hot. The biscuity goodness was biscuity, and good.

The show started off well. There were a few chuckles. A few chuckles morphed into outright laughter not long afterwards... and through a process of too many amusing things happening in too short a timeframe, the laughter started to back up onto itself.

I decided a reset would be in order. I stopped, took a deep breath, a sip of coffee, and a nibble of biscuit. It was at this point that one of the principal actors found that he could not get out of the set, and continuing his villainous laugh, tried door after door after door.

I lost it, breathed in when I should have breathed out, and a crumb of caramel coated biscuit became lodged in my throat. Even so, I could not stop laughing, so what came out was a whistling squeak/cry/howl/gag/choke noise.

It was at this point that my wife came beetling (and by that, my dear, I mean sashaying with an abundance of feminine grace, only quicker) down the corridor convinced that I was having a stroke.

By this time, I had rolled off the sofa, and was desperately trying to cough up biscuit, which had apparently extruded grappling hooks and was refusing to be dislodged. Behind me, the principal actor was continuing his forced laugh, trying to find a way off the stage.

I could not stop laughing, even in these direst of circumstances.

With a final HACK, the likes of which even the most hairbally cat would gaze upon in awe, I dislodged the crumb, moments before passing out... and lay on the floor, continuing to giggle sporadically.

My wife gave me that look. Those married men among you will know the one I mean. The one that implies that she could have done better had she not decided to settle when she did, and she returned to re-potting her plants at the other end of the house.

I lay there, face down, staring at the glistening traitorous crumb before me... and was about to rouse myself to remove it, when the cat rushed in - a little orange blur - and nicked it.

It beats his usual letting half-dead rats into the house at 3am, and saved me a tidying job, but was still disgusting. Nevertheless, a fitting end to a villainous comestible that seemed intent on depriving me of my life.

I binged the entire remainder of the season of The Goes Wrong Show (and if I'm honest, the rest of the biscuits) and don't regret a second of it. Especially the Christmas Special.

I asked her why she wanted to kill herself and she said life and why did I not take the pills from her. I didn’t because she needs them so I won’t just take them and dump them and at that moment I wouldn’t think she would take all those to harm herself. Because when I asked her why she had them Tuesday night she said she needed to take one but was scared she may over sleep. 

I asked do you want me to take away every sharp thing out the house and dump all the pills you would be mad at me about that, why kill yourself here and risk kids finding your body or me before I left I said if you want to kill yourself then go ahead because I can’t stop it. I go to work in a few hours later. I’ll send a message to check on her and no response. I’ll call eight times. No answer. I couldn’t leave work because of blackout time. I assume she is still upset. I get home about 5:30 and she was gone and I noticed her half of my daughter’s Xmas gifts were gone that she bought. I called again no answer so I went into the trash to get the note she ripped with her brother‘s number and call him to ask for help and what should I do within minutes police pull up and arrest me sheriff and police. The arrest warrant was read to me at the sheriffs office and it stated I grabbed her by her ankles, pulling her and caused her to scrape knees, which wasn’t true days leading up to this she was crashing to her knees because she couldn’t stand and walk times before she would just collapse because of POTS, which she had said it caused her to pass out and have seizures when standing up too fast or increased heart rate, she has woken up with bruises and scratches on her from fighting herself in her sleep or scratching hard, certain meds she takes causes bruising for some reason and she doesn’t even know why. I did notice some marks around her neck area that could have been caused by me holding her robe by the neck area during their attack, and if I caused those then I accept those she has a history of mental health issues being admitted to the hospital before she met me since being together, she has tried to harm herself from cutting her wrist and I was scared to get help because she is scared her ex will take the kids and because he has money and close with the police. She is worried that will happen. She has been emotionally unstable and violent from throwing and breaking things to self harm, threatening me and Herself.

I spend the night in jail. Paid 2000 to get out. We have stay away in place. Had bond review Jan 15th and judge and DA believes it should stay in place. She admitted I did none of those in the police report and she was so doped up she doesn’t know why but she was scared I was gonna call police, tell 17 year old daughter and her brother. So she tried to get me. We have talked since and been around each other even though we shouldn’t. But I do love her and I know she loves me and the kids love one another. She tried to go get charges dropped the same day actually but it’s not up to her. At the review she told the judge the truth and all he said “sounds like it’s all your fault and not his” which it isn’t. So I know they don’t care. The worst I did was not come home Tuesday after work to check on her but I had my reason. 

I don’t have the funds for a lawyer and I still pay bills at our home but I’m not allowed there. If I go to trial I know they will throw the book at me. First offense, no criminal record. Even she went to DA office again but they don’t want to hear it. Arraignment isn’t until April and it’s killing us not being together and the kids. Then who knows when trial will start. I do not want to cop out to anything I didn’t do and she doesn’t either but we want to be together. 

I just need advice on what to do and just any help as needed. The only photos they have was extremely bruised knees and that’s because she was falling at work, and at home. And one scratch on neck which is on police report. Please help me!! ",1,1738733825.0,legal,0,1.0,False

I have an alumni interview for Princeton tomorrow afternoon at a local coffee shop. This is my second interview following Stanford, which was virtual. Here’s the thing that I keep freaking out about:

What do I do when I get there? All our email has agreed on is “[coffee shop name] at 3pm”. Of course I’m going to get there early, but do I order a drink? Do I sit down? Do I wait at the front? How do I figure out if she’s arrived? 

I’m sure you’re probably thinking I’m ridiculous for these questions, but I’m a very anxious person. I get caught up on the smallest things — do I bring a notepad and take notes on it? How do I word my answer to the lofty “tell me about yourself” question, even when I know what to say? I know I’m supposed to “be myself” and that alumni interviews are “not that meaningful” but alas.

I’m hoping someone on here has something to say to ease my nerves just a bit. I’ve spent too much time scrolling on this reddit tonight and it’s getting to me…

I live in Australia and I find that the hospitality on all the airlines from budget to expensive is pretty poor. 

For reason I don’t really travel with Australian airlines. 

When I have gone overseas and used airlines from places like Greece, Indonesia, Singapore, china etc. 

I find their hospitality much more accommodating, and even in the budget airlines they provide you with things like tea and coffee, and often meals are included, in contrast with Australian airlines who would charge you. 

Something else I’ve experienced when traveling in other countries is when my baggage is slightly over, I don’t get charged, whereas in Australia I’ve never been able to get away with that. I’m not sure if I’m generalizing my experience in this case and would love to hear if others have had a similar experience. 

Would love to hear other people’s thoughts on why this might be. I know Australia is an expensive country, but  so is Singapore. My personal guess is that generally western cultures are less hospitable. ",0,1738733412.0,Flights,3,0.33,False

1ii2yk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/VillainyGroup/comments/1ii2yk2/the_villainy_of_a_horrific_manager/,The Villainy of a Horrific Manager,">Back in the dim, dark history of my early career, I had a horrible boss. I've had a few over the decades, but this one was real Jurassic Park level awful. You know... specifically the bit where the guy in the portaloo got eaten by the T-Rex.

[Bad Boss](https://preview.redd.it/2gwppo7qa9he1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=93107ade5f630ac89c0712f961a0c9c6213a4a3b)

We're talking early-1990's here, and my job was to review our company's interaction with various clients, and ensure that not only were our staff trying to maximise profit for the company, but also that the client wasn't being disadvantaged, and - most importantly - that government requirements were being adhered to.

It was, perhaps, not a noble job, or an exciting one with great work stories about feats of derring-do... but it paid the bills.

I'm also being purposely circumspect here, because the company is still around, and it was fairly niche, and while thirty years is thirty years, I could do with not being yelled at.

... but needless to say there were seen to be three primary risks.

That the company would incur significant fines for doing stuff that the government considered inappropriate.

The client would suddenly realise that we'd sold them something useless, or worse still, damaging, and we'd lose the all-important repeat business.

The frontline staff - who were not incentivised - would simply not bother trying to find the best option for either the client or the company, and would simply just do what got them to the tea-room faster.

It was a nit-picky job, and you had to have a fine attention to detail, which I did at the time.

>Less so now. My current role is much more interesting. I don't think I could go back to doing what I was doing in my 20s. Back then it required a lot of coffee. That amount of coffee would probably explode my ticker these days.

>It's also about the time I discovered energy drinks... which I'm fairly sure was one of the reasons I spent so much of my adult life wondering why my exercise regime was clearly not up to scratch.

Either way, it was an important part of the business, with a team of three people (plus manager), and a cockup was potentially financially and reputationally very awkward.

My manager at the time was a horrible person. She never had a kind word, and was always critical. She picked on all three of us mercilessly, holding meetings where she would take a client interaction at random, and pick apart our response to it.

>Exactly like that T-Rex from Jurassic Park did. Not the velociraptors, no... those were awesome... and nobody was going to hide in a bush and mutter ""Clever Girl"" at my manager so much as go ""NYARGH!"" and run away. Though, if I'm fair, I'm pretty sure she could see things that didn't move... and I never saw her chase a jeep.

Her complaints were usually that we didn't check (a), or we should have allowed (b), or just that we took too long, and we only got 30 compliance checks done in a day, when she wanted 60 or more. She turned a potentially merely dreary job into a horrible one.

We were all second-guessing ourselves... two of us were 'lifers', but the third position had an endless stream of people going ""Screw this!"" and leaving - with new hires needing to be trained, adding more to the workload than they were fixing.

One day, near the end of the year, she called in sick, and one of the other managers asked me to write her a quick note for when she came back.

I popped into her office, found some note paper, and opened a drawer to find a pen. That's when I found the 'prize'.

It was a certificate of appreciation, signed by the CEO, for ""Most effective team"" in the company. It praised our consistently high quality of work, our attention to detail, and her for leading us.

With it were instructions to treat the team to a night out at a restaurant for ""Winning the award three quarters in a row"". To say I was shocked was an understatement. I decided to not mention it, and see what transpired.

>We all know how this is going to go. These sorts of stories either end up with Malicious Compliance, or the glorious victory of small cog over big machine, right? The TLDR version is ""Yep, basically"", but...

A week later, towards the end of the quarter, we got an absolute bollocking from the manager. A full tethered-goat-behind-the-electric-fence gobbling scene, in which anyone who might have been passing would have blanched in terror.

She told us we were so far behind quota that she couldn't hold her head up in management meetings. We were lucky we weren't all on 'performance improvement' notices (Step One in getting someone fired), and that she was sick of telling us to up our game.

>I guess this would be called ""gaslighting"" in modern parlance. Back then the term didn't exist, and people tended to be a lot more married to their roles than is perhaps usual today. The job market was quite squished, so you didn't jump ship unless you had something to jump into.

Now, this absolute reaming wasn't unexpected, to be honest. I hadn't told the other two team members what I'd seen, but I did hatch a plan. A plan, as Baldrick would say, so cunning that One could pin a tail on it and call it a weasel.

One did not simply walk into Mordor and complain upstairs about One's manager. There was a risk that this could be seen as 'sour grapes' and would be shut down pretty quickly... so another tack had to be taken.

The company was quite 'flat' from a management perspective, so the CEO was only a couple of levels up from my manager... and he prided himself on having an open door policy.

>Admittedly, this often means ""I don't want to see you loitering in the doorway, you scurrilous little oik! But officially it's open, if anyone asks... but nobody better ask! But in this case, it seemed pretty legit.

>The CEO came across as bright, but one of those ponderous chaps - a vegie-saur rather than a meaty-saur - who had a bit of a reputation for walking the talk. The fact that he wasn't clued up on what was going on spoke volumes, but I didn't want to go into that.

I popped my head around the corner one evening after the T-Rex had stalked off ... but before he had ambled back into the foliage himself ... and meekly asked if he had a moment. He said yes.

I apologised profusely on behalf of my team for our dismal performance. I made a point of saying that our manager had explained in great detail what our shortcomings were, and that he shouldn't hold her accountable for how badly we were doing. I said that we had taken the initiative to start working on some new processes, so that we should be starting to hit quota very soon.

>""Please be nice to our poor boss, because it's us that are arse-biscuits, not her!"" can't be misconstrued as sour grapes... but contrition at-odds with his perception of things was certainly giving him enough information to ring alarm bells.

He was perplexed. He explained that as far as he understood it from the stats, we were smashing our quotas, and that's why we'd been winning awards and being taken out for dinners.

I feigned surprise, ""What awards? What dinners?"" and explained that my manager had just finished reaming us all out for being so far behind quota, that she was being blamed for our shortcomings, and that we were all so close to burnout as a result.

>I can feign with the best of them. My pearl-clutching and fainting game is so far above par that if I exploded, par would probably not see the flash for a week.

He showed me the stats... the actual quotas were about a third what we had been told... and we were smashing it.

We had won awards for efficiency, effectiveness, and one of the other team members had one for innovation after developing some of the software we used. It all came with money for meals, and in that one team member's case, a cash bonus. I said that we'd seen none of it, and that this was very troubling.

>Gosh, my pearls! I think the T-Rex must have eaten them!

He agreed, and advised me to leave it with him, and to assure the team that we were doing a great job.

Sooo. In the middle of the next day, our manager gets called into a meeting, and that's the last we ever saw of her. I'm told she was escorted from the building by security. That's almost unheard of in this country, where labour-laws very much favour the employee.

The CEO himself turned up in our office and told us we were well-respected, and a clear asset to the company, and to carry on as we were - and that we'd be without a supervisor for a few days.

I was later told that consideration was being made to have the T-Rex charged with theft, as she'd been pocketing money allocated to taking the team out for dinners, and cash bonuses. I did not hear how that ended up, but I daresay that if they did end up pursuing it, she wouldn't have had a leg to stand on.

Cash bonuses were paid in arears... and while we were all cautioned not to tell staff outside our team what had transpired, a company-wide meeting had us all dragged up in front of the crowd to tell everyone just what a sterling job we were doing... we were each given supermarket vouchers that effectively meant that we could eat for free for a month... and several free lottery tickets (which unfortunately come to nothing, but hey).

We now also reported directly to the person immediately under the CEO, who was quite happy to leave us to it, as long as we kept up our numbers and quality... which we did quite capably. The job suddenly became a dreary joy, rather than a dystopian nightmare.

>So, as this admittedly self-indulgent tale draws to a close, and those of you who are still awake are drifting off into blissful slumber, let us spare a moment to remember all of those folk who are unappreciated in their roles, and deserve better. From the general rank and file to nurses, teachers, child-care workers, frontline emergency services, and all.",1,1738733297.0,VillainyGroup,0,1.0,False

1ii2uqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ii2uqk/stuck_in_the_middle_of_a_sexual_harassment_case/,Stuck in the middle of a sexual harassment case involving two of my friends.,"I (28F) have known my best friend (32M) for almost 10 years. He has had his ups and downs in life and has always come to me to vent, ask for advice, etc. We actually became friends because he went through a really hard time. We met through an old job neither of us work at anymore and he hated me when we first met. At that job, he was very disliked by our bosses (we were both paramedics) because he was a bit of a troublemaker and was friends with a shitty employee who ended up getting fired. 
Eventually, there was another guy we worked with who my friend thought he was friends with but, my friend is very bad with boundaries and ended up being reported to our bosses for not leaving the other male employee alone (following him to his car when he wouldn't talk to him, blowing up his phone, etc.). This led to my friend being told he needed to resign or he'd be fired. his is where our friendship started.
We got close, and I developed feelings, which he didn't reciprocate. I did not respect his boundaries in this scenario and pushed him to tell me why he didn't like me because, in my eyes (I was 22-23 around this time and was very insecure), he treated me like a girlfriend (coming to visit me at work, bringing me coffee, always paying when we went out, blowing up my phone). He told me he didn't have feelings for me because I needed to lose weight (I'm a size 14). After this happened, I dropped everything and moved to Africa for two months and didn't have any phone service.
When I came back, he took me out to Starbucks and apologized. I gave him the gifts I bought him from Africa (I know, I know) and all was fine. Eventually, he became a cop and I switched jobs and him and his partner used to come visit me at work all the time when they were on duty because my assignment was in their district. He would bring me dinner, coffee, etc. but now it felt more like a sister less like a romantic thing.
Long story longer, I moved across the country to California for a job. I was sexually harassed and assaulted by my boss at this job only two months into my time there and I went to him for support and he blew me off for a hypochondriac issue he was dealing with (he thought he had cancer in his leg because one was more swollen than the other). I told him how hurt and angry I was that he wasn't there for me when I needed him and went NC for 10 months. I was home visiting family when I told him he could come talk if he wanted. We spent 8 hours together crying about what I went through and he apologized a bunch of times. 
Fast forward to NYE, I go home again for the holidays and him and I go out with his new work partner (a social worker for a mental health unit, he's still a cop). She and I are basically the same person and get along really well. We hit it off right away and we've been talking pretty much every other day since then. He had a crush on her and would say things to her like ""I think about you sitting on my face"", ""you have a nice ass, I look at it when you walk"", ""you should go off your birth control"", ""I like skinny blondes"", and other things similar. This made her extremely uncomfortable and she came to me about it. I talked to him, he got angry and said all he was doing was flirting with a girl he liked. I tried to explain to him that that's not flirting, it can be considered sexual harassment and he laughed and said no it's flirting. I tried to explain it to him from a women's perspective, and he ignored me. 
It's been about a month since this happened and he has now been reported by a third party for sexual harassment towards his partner. She came to me, worried about both of their jobs and asked me to warn him because she didn't want him to think she reported him. He found out before I could and called me about it. I told him what I knew (with permission from his partner) and he got angry again (he's very pushy and his mood can change quickly and he pops off). On the phone to me, he said things like ""this is immorally wrong"", ""this will ruin my life"", ""all I did was flirt with a girl I like"", etc. He also said that I ruined my abusers life by reporting him to our Title IX office. I told him the only person who ruined my abuser's life was my abuser when he decided to harass and assault his female employee (amongst the things he did in the 8 other complaints lodged against him that got him fired). My friend yelled at me and said objectively, I ruined my abuser's life. I hung up on him and about an hour later he called me and said I'm sorry and then continued to go on about the issue he was dealing with (which I understand, it is a lot to go through).
Anyway, sorry for the length. My question is, how do I go about being in the middle of this? He's mad that I still talk to her and I've tried to explain it's because I resonate with the position she's in and he keeps telling me I need to pick a side and I'm not trustworthy and have betrayed him for continuing to talk to her through this whole process. They have currently been moved to different office locations while this HR investigation is going on. I feel stuck in the middle. I want to be there for my friend of 10 years because he doesn't have many friends, but I also want to be there for my new friend (his partner, ex partner??) because I understand the position she's in and we get along so well and I don't want to ruin either friendship.

He told me he didn't have feelings for me because I needed to lose weight (I'm a size 14). After this happened, I dropped everything and moved to Africa for two months and didn't have any phone service.
When I came back, he took me out to Starbucks and apologized. I gave him the gifts I bought him from Africa (I know, I know) and all was fine. Eventually, he became a cop and I switched jobs and him and his partner used to come visit me at work all the time when they were on duty because my assignment was in their district. He would bring me dinner, coffee, etc. but now it felt more like a sister less like a romantic thing.
Long story longer, I moved across the country to California for a job. I was sexually harassed and assaulted by my boss at this job only two months into my time there and I went to him for support and he blew me off for a hypochondriac issue he was dealing with (he thought he had cancer in his leg because one was more swollen than the other). I told him how hurt and angry I was that he wasn't there for me when I needed him and went NC for 10 months. I was home visiting family when I told him he could come talk if he wanted. We spent 8 hours together crying about what I went through and he apologized a bunch of times. 
Fast forward to NYE, I go home again for the holidays and him and I go out with his new work partner (a social worker for a mental health unit, he's still a cop). She and I are basically the same person and get along really well. We hit it off right away and we've been talking pretty much every other day since then. He had a crush on her and would say things to her like ""I think about you sitting on my face"", ""you have a nice ass, I look at it when you walk"", ""you should go off your birth control"", ""I like skinny blondes"", and other things similar. This made her extremely uncomfortable and she came to me about it. I talked to him, he got angry and said all he was doing was flirting with a girl he liked. I tried to explain to him that that's not flirting, it can be considered sexual harassment and he laughed and said no it's flirting. I tried to explain it to him from a women's perspective, and he ignored me. 
It's been about a month since this happened and he has now been reported by a third party for sexual harassment towards his partner. She came to me, worried about both of their jobs and asked me to warn him because she didn't want him to think she reported him. He found out before I could and called me about it. I told him what I knew (with permission from his partner) and he got angry again (he's very pushy and his mood can change quickly and he pops off). On the phone to me, he said things like ""this is immorally wrong"", ""this will ruin my life"", ""all I did was flirt with a girl I like"", etc. He also said that I ruined my abusers life by reporting him to our Title IX office. I told him the only person who ruined my abuser's life was my abuser when he decided to harass and assault his female employee (amongst the things he did in the 8 other complaints lodged against him that got him fired). My friend yelled at me and said objectively, I ruined my abuser's life. I hung up on him and about an hour later he called me and said I'm sorry and then continued to go on about the issue he was dealing with (which I understand, it is a lot to go through).
Anyway, sorry for the length. My question is, how do I go about being in the middle of this? He's mad that I still talk to her and I've tried to explain it's because I resonate with the position she's in and he keeps telling me I need to pick a side and I'm not trustworthy and have betrayed him for continuing to talk to her through this whole process. They have currently been moved to different office locations while this HR investigation is going on. I feel stuck in the middle. I want to be there for my friend of 10 years because he doesn't have many friends, but I also want to be there for my new friend (his partner, ex partner??) because I understand the position she's in and we get along so well and I don't want to ruin either friendship.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/KFH7BxuVSY): **January 27, 2025**

My husband (35M) and I (33F) have been married for 6 years and together for 10 (we knew each other forever, lol). We have 3 kids. When we got married, we were both pharmacists. Two years into our marriage, my husband opened a family business with his father, and the business is doing really well.

My husband gets 50% of the net revenue and owns a good amount of money, but everything is tied up in the company, and the balance is updated every year as the business grows. His father is worried that if we ever get divorced, I’ll ask for half of the business’s money, so he wants me to sign a document relinquishing that right.

For context, we’re Muslims, and in Islam, the woman is entitled to what was agreed upon prior to marriage in case of divorce. For me, that amount is around $120,000, and our house is already 50/50, so I wouldn’t ask for anything more. However, I don’t want to sign anything. I feel my husband should trust me when I say I would never ask for half of his share ins the business.

I also pointed out that his dad didn’t ask his mom to sign such a document, so why should I have to? So, AITA for refusing to sign this?

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**cthulularoo:** Technically a Post-nup. Money and family is always a tricky subject. Is he offering you anything for this consideration?

You're technically entitled to this money because as his wife, you helped him build the business. If he wants you to give up something you're entitled to, there's got to be some sort of compensation for it. Its not even a trust issue for me, its just you shouldn't be screwed over.

NTA, get a lawyer to help cover your butt.
> 
> **OOP:** For him I am entiteled to this half.
> 
> he is saying that I am only entiteled to what was agreed on when we got married the 120k and thats it. I agree because this is how our religion is despite living in canada. I wanted to tell him that I am working as well for him to build his wealth and it is not fair to not get anything if we divorced but I dont want to go to this extent yet. Like whenhe travels I stay with the kids and care for them 100%. Thats work too and If i dont do it proprly he wouldnt be able to do what he does
>> 
>> **AdmirableCost5692:** you are misunderstanding Islamic laws here. you can't pick and choose. firstly your mehr should have been received at the time of nikah. the nikah is not valid without you receiving that money (I'm not joking). secondly, if they are so intent on islamic values they should not have allowed you to contribute a single penny of your earnings to the household and paid for ALL your and the children's expenses. thirdly even after divorce your husband has to pay ALL expenses relating to kids and I do mean all. that means the settlement in the event of divorce far far exceeds what you think.
>> 
>> it's funny how people use religion only when convenient for them. they are manipulating you. any settlement you get in a Canadian court will be less than a proper islamic settlement. don't sign anything. and get your 120k if you haven't already. if you invested that into the business than you are totally entitled to returns from that investment. so if that was a third of the seed money, you are entitled to a third of the company now.
>> 
>> get a lawyer and protect your investment in the company. I wouldn't trust these people as far as I could throw them.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/D0SOMcm43i): **January 29, 2025 (two days later)**

First, I want to sincerely thank everyone for their words. I truly benefited from each and every comment, and I felt so empowered reading your perspectives.

I couldn’t sleep last night thinking about what to say to my husband. He usually wakes up around 5 AM to go to the gym and have his coffee in peace before the kids wake up, so I decided to wake up with him (hello, headache all day!).

I told him that I was completely shocked when he asked me to sign this document—especially since he was actually okay with me signing it. I asked him, How can you say I’m not entitled to anything? I work my ass off from 9 to 5, then come home to cook, take care of the kids, and handle bedtime. And at the end of the month, I don’t see a penny—everything goes to the bills. Sure, he pays for our trips, clothes, and gifts, but I never ask for anything or tell him what to buy me.

Then I brought up religion. I told him, If you want to talk about religion, let’s be fair about it. Islamically, my money is my own, and you’re not supposed to use it. If that’s the case, I want every dollar I earned back—around $300K for the five years I worked.

I also told him that if he really wants me to sign, I will—but with my own lawyer. Because apparently, I’ve been too naïve and should have known better.

Finally, I told him that we were supposed to be saving together, but now he’s saying that in case of divorce, I get nothing? So what was all my hard work for?

At one point, I got really emotional and started crying because I was genuinely hurt that he thought this was okay. That’s when he hugged me, apologized, and promised he wouldn’t ask me to sign anything. He even said he’s willing to put half of everything in my name right now—just not the controlling rights and whatnot.

I still have a lot to process, and the meeting with the account who suggested this in the first place but at least for I feel heard. Thank you all again for your support!

**Relevant Comments**

**Analisandopessoas:** Congratulations, you acted maturely and were spot on.

> **OOP:** honestly If it wasnt for this community I wouldnt be able to do it this way. I dont talk to my parents when my husband and me fight becasue they will take my side especially when things like this happen so I prefer to discuss with stargers. You really put everything into perspective. How I didnt save a penny from my work, how I am raising the kids and everything so really thank you

**Fancy_Association484:** We are sure there is no mistress?

> **OOP:** for now yes! I mean as I said never say never. my husband and I weree high school sweetheart and he did cheat on me at some point when we were young but never again so maybe he is back to his old self? time will tell and how the next few day unfold

**TodayIAmMostlyEating:** Sounds like you reminded him how financially in the shit he’d be if you divorced and got what you were legally entitled to. He’s like “oh shit, she did some research. Back pedal quickly!”
> 
> **cosmopolite24:** This is THE comment OP should be paying most attention to.
> 
> Also OP needs to share household expenses 50/50 with her husband. She needs her own savings and backup.
>> 
>> **OOP:** The thing is we were never a 50/50 everythings is ours and it goes both way. This is why he caught me off guard with his request and me thinking that this saving is also ours. When we were takking I told him that I have no problem , give me my money back and moving forward make sure you bring 5K extra plus 1k as alimony for me because this is what the religion tells you😂😂😂

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!hostile workplace!<

[Original Post](https://www.askamanager.org/2008/09/verbally-abusive-boss.html)  **Sept 11, 2008**

I recently left a large internet company to join a well established, yet small creative agency. The company’s philosophy of listening and constantly learning really connected with me and the team was very passionate about doing good work for a great set of clients.

The issue here is the level of verbal abuse that I have since found out is a feature of the work environment. The cool radio station playing in the background wasn’t because the office was hip – it was to cover up the screaming coming from the executive office for even the smallest offenses. Late 10 minutes? Well, you are going to get yelled at for a half hour and have every other fault or perceived flaw flung at you along with a litany of questioning of your professionalism and dedication. Didn’t convey the exact message that the founder force fed you before a client meeting? Well, that is good for at least an hour.

I have tried everything from being calm and reasonable, to trying to get a work in edge wise, to confronting him and telling him behavior is unprofessional and damaging, to just flat out ending the conversation and walking out. Unfortunately, because I am not willing to sit through these tirades with my hands folded and head down like all of the other executive team, I am being froze out of key meetings and now enduring work which is totally not in my job description suddenly becoming my responsibility (i.e. I am a producer and suddenly I am being told that site QA, customer research and architecture work is also part of my duties).

I am a senior level person with over 10 years of experience and have not had the experience of working for someone who only knows how to express themselves by yelling. I just started this job and really would like to get a year in before going, but this is taking a toll on my health and I dread stepping foot in this place. There were also a whole host of things that they flat out lied about during the interview process (no 401k, no flexible hours, team is widely dispersed) and I would have never taken this role if I had known. I am not sure what to do here – I am very on edge and don’t think I have it in me to deal with another day wasted with these tirades.

[Update](https://www.askamanager.org/2009/12/where-are-they-now-update-2-featuring.html)  **Dec 19, 2009**

I emailed you a little over a year ago (see entry under “jerks” for September 2008) about my verbally abusive boss at a small creative agency. Well – I hung in there until I couldn’t stand it any longer and found something else and gave my notice two days before the Thanksgiving break in 2008. I honestly don’t think I have ever had such a tirade unleashed against me as when I gave my notice. He badgered me over and over about how I had misconstrued his yelling and that he was just passionate about his work. It then turned into a horrible set of personal attacks and threats of lawsuits if I ever contacted anyone from the agency again – he even demanded that I remove the agency’s name from my LinkedIn profile as he perceived it to be some sort of legal infringement for me to even say I had ever worked there.

Long story short – instead of the two weeks I intended to give, I left at the end of the following day. This was not before he got the whole company together (about 20 people) in the conference room to talk about how little I had added to their process and how they would be going on and probably doing better now that I was gone. Two more people gave their notices by the end of that day because he was such a tyrant about the whole thing.

Unfortunately the job I left for was somewhat out of the frying pan and into the fire. I left for a publicly traded, much larger creative agency as a director and was really excited to get to hopefully work with some decent folks again. On day one – I got a taste of how things really were – they “forgot” to mention that I was expected to keep a set of clothes at work for all of the all-nighters and then showed me the **sleeping bunks they had built along with a shower so folks could live at work.**

I was given accounts in both LA and NY (despite having been told there would be no travel), so I worked from 5am til 8 or 9pm and was routinely called out in executive meetings for not taking one for the team (all the rest of whom where single and without kids unlike me) and staying on with them all night. The final straw was when the company did not protect me from a mid-level manager who obviously had mental issues and that I had a strong hand in her getting fired because of client complaints. She slashed my tires, broke into the office and stole a laptop, and then called my multi-million dollar client and aired all of the company’s dirty laundry. When they left her go, I was told to leave the office and stay at a nearby cafe because they were worried that she would become physically violent – never mind that I had to buy my own coffee. In the end, even though the worst did not take place, I had to endure numerous phone calls from her at all hours and slanderings on facebook.

After 10 months, I have since left that agency as well and have vowed to never work in an agency again. I am currently relocating and am looking for a nice, “normal” quiet job after taking 6 months off to recuperate.

On Amazon it looks like the best selling is made by Breville and its $700 which could be ok because its everything included for beans and milk but still she said look be sure thats the best for that price or is there anything cheaper?

So it doesnt have to be best thing ever but better than just putting pods in but also then i dont know if it should take beans or ground coffee because that one has grinder for beans but a lot dont. If they dont but are nearly as expensive are they better?

Hi everyone, I will try to summarize this story as much as I can, but please know this comes from my heart as I don’t seem to forget or move on from this although around 6 years have passed. It all started in college, I met my best friend, Ana, who I loved as a sister. We studied the same major, so we spent a lot of time together. We even had the same group of friends. At that time, I was in a ‘serious’ relationship with John (21M). At the beginning of it, everything was just fine, we kinda connected quickly and he was loving. But as time passed, he started to behave differently. He would emotionally abuse me almost every day. Around 6 months before our breakup, I had a tough time graduating from college as I had to increase my loans and also my mom was diagnosed with cancer. I could barely afford to take care of myself as most of my time was spent on taking care of my mom. Still, I managed to see him often. Usually, I would show up on sweat pants and a hoodie as I just wanted to be comfortable, but his comments towards my appearance started to hit harder. He once said that he wished we weren’t seen together because he wouldn’t want for people to think he had a horrendous girlfriend. That he started a relationship with someone pretty (I always did my hair and makeup, dress up to see him) and now I was just a fatty. I cried my eyes out that day. To add insult to injury, I still loved him. Anna was most of the time supportive, but I guess she couldn’t handle it anymore and started to push for a breakup. I was young and naive, nothing mattered as I always would remember the nice person he was at the beginning of our relationship. 2 weeks before my birthday, he broke up with me because he was no longer in love. He just sent me a text saying he had had a dream and that was it, he didn’t want to be with me anymore. I went to his house, a 3 yo relationship deserved better than a text. He said if he did that in person, he knew I would beg him and he would change his mind. He said we needed to go on separate ways. At this time, his mom arrived at his house and she comforted me, said his own son didn’t deserve a person like me, that I was too good for him and he has to learn that the bad way. I spent one or two weeks crying in my bedroom. It was not only my birthday week but also my mom’s first surgery, and I was alone. Without his support. I felt my world was falling apart. During this time, Ana tried her best to make me feel better. We would hang out and she would listen. However, she started to say ‘I told you so’ more often. She would highlight how small I was before him, as he would always end up getting what he wanted. She would emphasize how I wouldn’t listen to her advice and ended up doing what I wanted. That I didn’t cherished her friendship, even when she just wanted the best for me. She recommended to start going out again, and just look for crazy s-x to forget about everything. He was my first boyfriend, kiss, time, etc. Opening Tinder and getting in bed with someone I didn’t know didn’t seem like a good idea. It wasn’t something I would do. But she thought it could help. I gave it a try after a couple weeks, and I didn’t like it. It wasn’t for me. I was in the middle of, do I want to be alone or not? After 3 years, should I do something else instead? Focus on my career and my mom? I decided to try something different and enrolled in a cooking program she was taking. There I met some of her friends, and also met, Peter, who is now one of my best friends. Peter, Ana, Jake (one of her friends) and I started to hang out more often. I fell in love with our friendship. We would meet twice a month to spend time together. We’d ordered food, get some drinks, set up karaoke time, etc. I knew a bit about Jake, he tried to go out with Ana but she was in love with someone else at that time. I think they had dinner twice and then she told him she didn’t want to continue with their thing as she had feelings for someone else. She told me he kinda started to act weird and that most of their friends went his side. After months, they started to hang out again but just as friends. There was no kiss or anything else between them. And that’s when we created our group with Peter, Jake, Ana and I. So all that Ana and Jake thing happened like 3 years before we started our group friendship. At the time, I had this job that I hated but kept to pay my student loans. So, I would choose to drink when I could. Peter, Ana, and Jake would always try to cheer me up, but my job, mom’s situation, and my recent breakup would always make me feel like I needed to get alcohol to survive. Jake and I started to chat almost every day. He’d call to check on me and my mom. He even offered to loan me some money to quit my job. At first, I had no feelings, I saw him as I friend. But, things started to change, and we connected. I didn’t want to fell in love with him as I knew that something had happened between him and Ana. I knew she wouldn’t approve of.  So We kept our feelings in secret for around 2 months. Jake opened up my eyes. Everything with him was completely different from John, he would treat me right, support me, and I felt I didn’t deserve all his love and care. When we decided it was time to tell Ana and Peter, I started to feel anxious. I would call him crying, telling him I didn’t want Ana to be mad with me. That I knew this was against girl code and that it was better if we ended up things. But we would always realized that we felt something and it was strong, so it deserved a chance. We deserved a chance. We first told Peter, and he was so happy for us. He supported our relationship, even if it ended up badly, we deserved to find out ourselves, he said. I felt like I could gather some courage and tell Ana, so I invited her for coffee and told her, immediately she said ‘I feel like I’m gonna vomit, you disgust me’. I tried to tell her how much we cared about each other and that we didn’t want wished for all this to happen, it just did. I told her that if she wanted I could end up things with him, as her friendship was more valuable to me. But she said the damage was done. That she would never trust me again and I was the one who broke our group apart. That friends are not supposed to fall in love with each other and that I took her 3 years to be in good terms with Jake again and I screwed that for her. That she knew everything would happen again as it did with John and I wouldn’t listen to her so she’d end up hating Jake too. I think I never cried like I did that day. I felt like I had betrayed my sister and that things could not get amended. I was right, after 2 weeks of silence, she said she didn’t want to be friends anymore and just like that our 8 year friendship ended. I never felt so sad in my life, but I had Jake and Peter. Time passed and Jake and I built a strong relationship, we are now married and expecting our first child. He is such a great husband and I know he will be an awesome dad. He’s everything I had wished for. I love him truly, and I would choose him all over again every time. But there are some days where I feel alone, and where I miss Ana so much. After all that happened with her it has been very difficult for me to get new friends. So my friends circle is very limited. Jake is almost all that I have besides two or three male friends. Was I the AH the whole time? Should I have chosen her instead of him? Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if she had accepted our decision. I wish she was in my life, but somehow, sometimes I feel like we also were in some kind of abusive friendship as well. I still have her on social media, so I’m able to get some kind of updates on her life. Overall I feel happy for her. I still love her, and wish nothing but the best for her. We haven’t talked ever since, it’s been 6 years, and days like today I feel I wish I had her in my life. 

PD: I’m now 28 years old. All this happened when I was 21-23. my mom is on remission, doing just fine. Sorry if there are any mistakes English is not my native language.",2,1738731530.0,AITAH,8,0.75,False

1ii2dot,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExclusivelyPumping/comments/1ii2dot/16_months_of_breastfeeding/,16 Months of Breastfeeding!,"I've been breastfeeding for 16 months. Full disclosure: I don't actually exclusively pump, baby also nurses, but I've pumped 4+ times a day, every day, for almost a year and a half! So I definitely identify with this sub, and always have!

When I started out I used to cling to this sub for any piece of wisdom I could possibly glean, it was so so so helpful. I told myself if I made it to one year I would make a post about my own story and tips and tricks to hopefully help others and you all have helped me. So here I am!

Pumps: I use the Spectra gold and MomCozy S9pro. I honestly cannot recommend both of these pumps enough, I have been so happy with them. I pump 20 minutes with the Spectra and 30 minutes with the MomCozy. On an average day I use the Spectra 3x and MomCozy 1x, on days I use the MomCozy 2x I actually produce more? Not sure why... but I still prefer my Spectra.

Our Journey: Baby girl was born in October 2023. She had colic (hate that term), reflux, torticollis, and tongue tie. We had a really rough start to nursing and after about one week we did a weighed feed and realized she was only taking 1oz in 45 minutes. I started triple feeding at that point, went to target and bought a pump that day (hadn't bought one because I thought I wouldn't need it until I went back to work lol, idiot). I triple fed for 9 weeks, 8x a day, for a total of 90 minutes each time (obviously got help from others!). At about 6 weeks, I realized she had severe MSPI, I cut out everything from my diet and she started doing better. At 8 weeks we got her tongue tie lasered, and those changes mixed with her just growing older allowed me to eventually stop triple feeding, but by that time I was already so used to pumping and had an oversupply so I was scared to stop. So I have been combo nursing/pumping ever since! But mostly pumping! Baby grew out of her MSPI around 10 months and that was a HUGE  mental boost to be able to add back in dairy, gluten, and soy (and oat and coconut!)! At this point I am down to 4 pumps a day, and my supply is stable. I dropped to 3 pumps a day and my supply was declining, so 4 it is! At this point I have no plans to stop, as it's working for us, baby hasn't really taken super well to solids, and I don't mind pumping!

Some of my ""must haves"": 
1. Legendairy pumping spray - I literally cringe anytime I have to pump without this. It is my #1 must have for comfort.

2. Legendairy pink duck bills - they are heavier duty and work better with the fridge hack imo.

3. Munchkin Milkmakers Lactation Drink - this has worked wonders for me any time my supply has dipped. I drink one a day for a week and have rebounded every time. Note: it does have fenugreek, which can have the opposite effect for some people!!!

4. A space heater!!! - it sounds weird, but the room I pump in is cold! Once I got a space heater (our furnace went out so we bought one and then I just kept using it), it was so much easier for me mentally. I now look forward to drinking my coffee and sitting in front of my cozy heater in the mornings.

5. Sunflower lechitin - any time I have dropped a pump I start taking it proactively, and then also any time I feel any discomfort I take some. Lifesaver.

6. Multiple sets of parts - for both my mobile and my main pump I have multiple sets, honestly aside from the obvious convenience, I have dropped and broken pieces numerous times (sleep deprivation is rough...) and the peace of mind knowing I have another set is WORTH IT!

7. Husband who helps!! - pumping is so so hard. My husband is the primary bottle and parts washer and it makes all the difference. It's the worst when it's time to pump and your pumps aren't clean, so if there is anyone that can help you, recruit them!! 

8. Ceres Chill- I don't use this in my everyday life, but things like flights, weddings, a day at Disneyland, etc. become instantly less stressful. It was a splurge that I didn't get until about 6 months in, and it's possible to survive without it, but I really do appreciate having it and it works really well!

I put ""must-have"" in quotation marks because I know not everyone needs them, but it sure has helped me.

I am so grateful to this sub for all the wisdom, the stories, the tips, and more than anything just making me feel NOT ALONE. This journey has been so much harder than I ever expected, but I'm so proud to have kept up this long. If you're just getting started on your pumping journey, YOU GOT THIS!!!

1ii2dde,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ii2dde/aitah_for_trying_to_discipline_my_nephew_and/,AITAH for trying to discipline my nephew and making my brother disown me?,"While visiting my parent’s house, I (M30) got into a huge argument with my brother (M28) back in December in front of our whole family. What started the fight was when my nephew (M6) scratched my youngest son (M3),on purpose, below his eye because they were fighting over a toy. I heard my son crying, so I went over to investigate. When I asked what happened, my son said “cousin scratched me.” So when I asked my nephew what happened, he started saying gibberish trying to make an excuse. I stopped him and said “Did you scratch him? Yes or No?” Immediately he confesses and I sternly tell him not to do that. Suddenly, my brother yells from the background “No, OP, your kids have been fighting with my kid all day. Don’t get mad at him!” I’ve been in and out of my parents house running errands, so I wasn’t able to monitor my kids as closely. But when my brother said this, the first thing that came to mind was “So you’ve been watching them fight all day and done nothing?” It went from 0 to 100 with both of us screaming at each other, forcing our wives and our parents to physically push us apart. My wife dragged me to the car, which I went without resistance. But as my brother and I were going our separate ways, we were screaming insults at each other. 

Now for some context: 
This tension between my brother and I started a few years back. My wife and two kids went to visit him and his family when they moved to a neighboring states. At that point we had not seen each other for a few years (due to our jobs), and in that time his wife had a son and my wife had 2. When we visited, I noticed my nephew was very “physical”. By this, I mean he would push my sons on the hardwood floor, into the coffee table, off the couch, he would hit, throw toys in their face, and he would bite. It made me so worried, that I did not trust my nephew alone with my sons. My wife also noticed and we tried to monitor and mitigate the best we could. What did my nephew’s parents do? Absolutely nothing. My sister-in-law did notice our concern towards the end of our visit but gave minimal effort to intervene. One day, my nephew threw a toy excavator into my youngest son’s face as hard as he could because he had moved one of my nephew’s favorite toys. My sister-in-law saw this and asked my brother to do something. My brother just yelled “What?!? They’re just kids” and preceded to go back to his business. 

From that point on, every interaction or visit with my nephew would end up with one of my sons crying because -you guessed it- my nephew intentionally hurting them. It only got worst a couple of years ago when my brother and his family moved into the same neighborhood as us. I was ecstatic to have my brother live so close to me, but I was not excited to have my sons interact more with my nephew. Despite the abuse, my sons were always excited to see their cousin. Some days, they would be sad when we didn’t go over to their house. But the abuse only got worst. One day I came home, looked at my youngest son, and it looked like an eagle tried to gouge out his eyes. I was furious when I asked my wife what happened. She sighed and said “…..cousin.” She said they were fighting over an iPad. Not trying to confront my brother, my wife and I agreed we need to limit visitations with their cousin. Some time later, I come home from work and my wife asked to talk to me. She told me that my nephew pushed my oldest son off a trampoline (while he was outside the safety net) and got hurt. Luckily my son did not sustain any serious damage but I wondered if he had landed on his arm or neck. At that point, I called my brother, explained to him what happened and told him that we’re taking a long break from having our kids play with each other. 

After a few months went by, we slowly exposed the kids to each other once more. Only this time, I watched them like a hawk whenever they played together. This has been going on for over a year now. While the nephew still hurts his cousins, it was never to the extent like in the past. Our family, mutual friends, and neighbors also noticed that my nephew can be a little too much. Whenever our kids and the neighborhood kids played together, one of them will get a parent to complain that my nephew was being mean, throwing sand, hitting, etc.

Fast forward to the present, I called my brother to apologize for our fight in December. By this point we had not talked for over a month because I wanted to make sure everything cooled down. I said I was sorry if I may have overstepped my boundaries by lightly scolding his son. Immediately he starts insulting me again and claiming that I’m bias when it comes to disciplining the kids. I’ll admit, my kids also start fights with their cousin, but it never got physical or psychological like how my nephew treated mine. I always stepped in when my kids were treating my nephew unfairly but my brother rarely ever did anything when it was his son treating others badly. Not once did he ever apologize for the things that his son did to mine and he would always justify it with “They’re just kids!” For me, there’s a difference between kids fighting over a toy and causing intentional physical/psychological harm. I explained this to my brother, but again he replied with personal insults, called me a POS, and that the next time I speak to him that I need to have a better apology and promise to change. He then hung up on me. 

I’m in complete disbelief at this point and don’t know how to approach this. So AITAH?",1,1738731207.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False
1ii2c2l,https://i.redd.it/zyuzkjk649he1.jpeg,Help me figure out how much I'd save DIY,"Let me start by saying I'm dealing with a menagerie of health issues and energy isn't exactly a luxury. Naturally, that means budgets are tighter too. Given the state of...everything, I should probably give up coffee. But in the meantime, my vice is Starbucks cold brew (refrigerated). I usually go through a bottle a week. Would I save substantially if I started buying beans? I am particular about flavor and I am accustomed to the specific flavor of this one. 

There's also been a shortage on the heavy whipping cream I like (I avoid carrageenan) so maybe I just need to give it up. But I can't give up cold brew and Diet Coke simultaneously lol.",0,1738731077.0,coldbrew,4,0.33,False
1ii2bsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/1ii2bsw/who_scammed_me_uber_or_the_passenger/,"Who scammed me, Uber or the passenger?","I have a feeling I know the answer but I’m looking forward to reading the answers.

Today I gave a guy a ride. It had one stop plus drop off. At the stop I told him I was gonna go to the bathroom at the Starbucks next door, because the next leg of the trip was 40 minutes long. He asks me if I’ll get him a latte and that he’ll just tip a bit more at the end. I instantly thought of all the stories here on Reddit, but since it was a longer ride for about $100 I figured I’d roll the dice to see what would happen. So I bought him the $5 coffee.
This is the second time I’ve picked him up, and we had good conversation the entire trip. When I dropped him off he says “let me check what the maximum tip is”. And I just say “you do what you gotta do.” 
He holds the phone up and says “it’s $98.00”.
I say “hey, that’s a lot. Are you sure?”

He says “yeah, thank you so much, I appreciate the ride.” And he holds up the phone to show me he’s sending the tip.

I kind of glanced but didn’t really look, cuz I didn’t want to seem like I cared or even act like he owed it to me. I just thanked him and said that’s really cool of you.

I pull away, get to a parking spot and there’s no tip on the app. I close the app, reopen, etc, no tip. 

So at first thought I’m thinking he’s just a liar. I brush it off as whatever, I’d really like the extra $98.00 but I’m not gonna let that ruin my day. After thinking for a bit I wonder if it’s actually possible Uber just stole the tip.

So, what do you guys think? 

A) The rider is a liar and thinks he’s clever for getting a free $5 coffee or something to this affect.

Or

B) Uber stole the $98.00 and is actually has that level of audacity, or something to that affect.",1,1738731050.0,uberdrivers,17,0.57,False

This is what she wrote:,"**Curious to know what your take on this confession is**

11 years ago, FRIEND was messaging me as a friend and I let it go too friendly. I told HUSBAND I wouldn't message him again.

I saw him at soccer and just talked as friends. He knew I was pregnant with DAUGHTER and would ask how I was doing. About a year ago, I started to have more friendly conversations with FRIEND over What's App. Nothing was flirty or inappropriate at this time and I didnt delete the messages. I saw him occasionally at soccer or social events (FRIEND’s wedding) and we would just catch up with each other on life/ injuries with other mutual friends. Seemed to be normal. A couple months later the texts started getting more flirty and I liked the attention. We sometimes called each other to check in and see how life was. I deleted the messages and the calls. I felt guilty but I honestly felt like someone understood my anxiety and i didnt have the stress of kids or everyday life that i had with HUSBAND. He started to ask about my relationship. I admitted that I wasn't happy with how things are going but I still loved HUSBAND and i wanted to focus on the marriage. He seemed to be supportive with all of this. There were some weeks that HUSBAND wasn't being nice to me or I was having a bad week and FRIEND would ask how things are going with me and HUSBAND. I lied and said it was worse than it was to get support because I felt like I had none at home. I said things that I know would give me the validation I needed. That I cared about his support and he was helping me. There was emotional support that was lacking and felt HUSBAND wasnt able to provide at the time. I tried to talk to him about anxiety and emotions but at this point it was already too far gone and he was dealing with his own issues. We saw the small problems but not the big ones. I talked about my body insecurities. I sent a picture of my armpit area to show what I was insecure about. It wasn't a sexual picture but I can see how this may have been misleading. he asked me for more. A couple days later I sent a picture of my boobs. He sent a picture back but I asked him not to send me anything else. 

FRIEND asked what would happen if I asked HUSBAND to go to the football game with him as friends. I said he would say no. But FRIEND told me I should because we were friends and he would say yes. I was honestly surprised that HUSBAND said yes. He asked to go to the football game with me (I usually went and met up with a variety of people anyways). Nothing inappropriate was done at the game. He drove me home and then pulled over. He asked if he could touch me. I said no. We kept talking for a little about my issues and I felt supported, so when he touched my breasts again, I let it happen. I wasn't happy, I felt immense guilt but I didn't stop it. He asked if I could touch him. I said no but then once again I felt like I would lose the support if I didn't . So I did and i tried to get it over with as soon as possible and I didn't feel any connection or desire, I felt so guilty and ashamed. I told myself I'm stronger than that but at this point I knew I couldn't tell HUSBAND because I would lose everything. We had some talks after this about me not wanting to do this and him being in a relationship as well. He didn't seem like he was pressuring me to make a choice. This happened 3 more times.  each time I felt like i was digging myself into a bigger hole and was still not happy other than the emotional support which i wasn't getting when i was being physical. I tried to have conversations with FRIEND about how we couldn't keep doing this and I was always convinced that he was helping and not pressuring me into anything.

There was another time we stopped for coffee and were talking in his car about life. He asked to touch me again. I said yes and then a minute later said no. He listened. he then asked for a blow job. I said no and we continued talking. I'm honestly not sure what he said to convince me to. I was terrified afterwards. This wasn't how I wanted my life to go. I know I liked the support and the validation but I felt it got out of hand. I didnt know you could feel so guilty but also somewhat supported at the same time. It was easier to try and ignore the guilt and focus on the support I was getting. I tried looking for other ways to get the ""happy"" feeling. Nothing replaced the happy feelings I was looking for. He told me he had feelings for me but he didn't want to fuck up my marriage. I knew this didn't make sense because everything we were doing was fucking up my marriage. I was scared to tell HUSBAND anything was happening along the way because I felt like I was going to be screamed at/hurt/kicked out/felt feelings of never being good enough again. I wanted to be a good wife but I knew deep down I already fucked that up. There was no kissing/sex or any other touching of my body. That felt way too intimate and I felt sick even thinking about it. I wish I would have been stronger to say no and stick with it the previous times.

He had a girlfriend for a couple of months towards the end. I asked him how he could say these things to me and still go home to her. I wanted to find a reason for why I was doing what I was doing. He always said that he knew he couldn't be with me so he needed to have someone else to fulfill those needs. I really just wanted the emotional support and I felt like I needed to do more physical things eventually to get that. it sickens me thinking I thought this. 

After this all went down and I lied to try to save anything I could. I only told part of the truth because it was easier. I called FRIEND to tell him that i told HUSBAND about our relationship. He asked me if there was anyway i could save it. I told him i couldn't talk to him again and to leave me alone. Not the right decision. I felt ashamed and angry at myself. I realized how much bigger of a problem it was. there was anxiety, self worth, communication and abandonment issues that I never saw in the moment. It feels like I was on a bad autopilot and just going with anything that felt good to get rid of the shame. It wasn't the right choice. If I was worried about not being good enough for HUSBAND before, that's something I struggle with even more now because of what i did to him. 

I feel so guilty and ashamed that I didn't realize how bad things had got before it was too late. I made decisions that I am not proud of and will forever remember. I will grow from this experience and become a person who is more in control of her life.

He sneezes as soon as the sun hits his face. Could never figure out why, but bless him for every sneeze. 

He makes a mean grilled cheese. Can’t cook much else but seriously, a damn good grilled cheese. 

He’s not great with turning lights off after leaving a room. I’d joke that it’s like Diwali when he’s around. 

He takes his coffee black. Sometimes he gets cream and sugar at Dunkin, and if he’s feeling crazy he’ll get the caramel crunch frappe at Starbucks if he’s really feeling it. But you’ll have to order that for him bc he’s too shy. 

He’s obsessed with orangutans - monkeys in general but orangutans especially. Send him cute/funny monkey videos and you’ll make his day. 

He jerks around in his sleep when he’s stressed. His eye tends to twitch too and you’ll find him fidgeting a lot more. 

Speaking of fidgeting, he loves fidget toys and they really do help him. Especially to stop him from biting his nails. 

He can never sit still when on the phone - he has to pace around and move. Don’t try to get him to sit down, it won’t work. 

I’m sure you know by now how loudly he stomps while walking. He says it’s bc he grew up on the beach and is used to walking in the sand. 

Play along with his crazy “would you rather” scenarios and keep it going - he gets a real kick out of it and can validate his answers almost always. 

He loves debating people. Over anything, anytime. Could be about the littlest thing ever, but he loves a good educational debate. I learned a lot. 

Be on his side. Even if you know he’s wrong or you disagree, be on his side at least in front of other people. I wasn’t great at this and I learned that it made him feel invalidated. 

I hope you’re a foodie bc he loves being adventurous and will try almost anything. He especially loves spicy food and can handle more heat than I can. 

He can close off and become panicked when stressed. Unless he asks for it, try not to offer help and just validate him instead. He just needs a good shoulder to rely on. 

He’s a god awful dancer but he’s a good sport about it. If he’s comfortable, he’ll give it his best shot. 

I always thought he could be a great singer if he wasn’t tone deaf. He has a beautiful voice but can’t seem to hit the notes unfortunately. 

He tends to be closed off with his emotions but eventually he’ll open up. He always said that was something he wished he could be better at. I’m sure with time you’ll get to see how tender his heart is. 

He messes up sometimes but don’t we all? I hope he’s putting effort into the things that matter. You’re lucky to get that version of him. 


Take care of him for me. He’s my greatest love yet also my hardest. But I don’t regret a single thing of the last 7 years we spent together. He’s the best companion I could’ve asked for. Be his supporter and he’ll support the hell out of you right back. I wish you both well. ",7,1738730710.0,UnsentLettersRaw,2,0.9,False

We got talking and eventually became friends. 

I like how funny she is, her sense of humour is great, she's caring always looking out for others, puts others before herself, we both have alot of similar interests, both like similar dumbass memes.

She goes to my college, I'll pass by her and she'll start talking to me and id join in with her and her friends. I enjoy hanging out with her friends in general cause we all get along and have similar interests I feel. 

She's quitting her job and handed in her notice, she'll be done in two weeks 

I thought about asking her out because I like those qualities I mentioned about her and people said either we we'd make a great couple or we were very close so I thought about potentially asking her out. I got signs she was interested atleast from my perspective. We've had great banter for a while and we'd text alot so I thought maybe it would be a good idea to try

The other day me, her and a few others friends went out and we all got drunk, I made a fool of myself as you do when drunk and hanging out with friends just making dumb jokes, when I got home I texted her asking her ""if she'd like to get coffee sometime as od like to hang out with her?"". I tried asking her out a while ago before we both started work but she didn't look at our messages till later on after work. 

Anyways, the next day after the night out we hung out again with a different group of friends, I noticed this time she wasn't really talking to me as much, I thought it over and think I might be overreacting with it since it was with friends she hadnt seen for a while so maybe she wanted to talk to these friends more and catch up which is fair I was kinda doing the same tbf.

But it was like anytime I tried to engage conversation with her it would be met with like one word answers or nothing that kept the conversation going. I might be overthinking that one as she was probably wanting to catch up with her friends 

But something I noticed is that when texting since the other night is that it's been very lacking, only really one word responses, not alot of engagement or banter that she used to do. She left me on read for several hours aswell. 

I feel like she caught wind that I like her but she doesn't feel the same way which is fine with me, if she isn't interested I won't pursue it further but I just worry she's trying to loose touch with me or doesn't want to talk to me anymore. I don't want to stop talking to her as I enjoy hanging out with her alot. I don't know what to do really. I won't see her again till the weekend so I thought about not saying or doing much till I see her in person. She has texted me a little bit and I respond as usual so maybe shes fine with everything.

Since she's quitting and isn't in college this semester so I won't see her till September unless we both happen to attend the same social gathering. 

My question is there ways to patch things up and go back to how it was before or is she just gonna try and avoid me for having an interest in her? 

TL:DR there's a girl I like, the other day me and a few friends were drunk and I asked her out for coffee since we won't be seeing each other alot anymore and now Ive noticed she's not really talking to me that much.

I suffer with Idiopathic Intercranial Hypertension and an extreme caffeine addiction. 

My head is absolutely killing me from the lack of caffeine and not eating for almost 48 hours. I can't get my appetite back because my head hurts so bad. On Monday morning (~330a) I woke up with it violently coming out of both ends. At one point the vomit became really bloody and I went to the hospital, got some treatment, told I had a Mallory-weiss tear and to go home and get some rest and go back if the bleeding became severe for surgery. 

It didn't, luckily, I've been on the up and out. But my head is killing me. I'm a one - two monsters a day or at least upwards of 40oz of coffee and my diamox (500mg 2-3x daily) to function.

I've tried Tylenol to help the headache and it's not helping. The nausea is starting to return just from how bad my head hurts. I can't sleep because my head hurts so bad. Everywhere I looked online said no coffee or caffeine for 3-5 days post stomach bug and I can't function like this. 

Do I really have to wait or can I make some coffee to help ease the headaches?

like when i was 14 i got catcalled for the first time while wearing a *hoodie* and *sweatpants* walking home from school. literally just existing. dude pulled up in his car and was like ""hey sweetheart wanna ride?"" like SIR. I AM A CHILD. and that wasn’t even the worst one—when i was 17 i was walking to the store in BROAD DAYLIGHT and some guy FOLLOWED ME for three blocks trying to get my number. i literally had to duck into a coffee shop and pretend to be meeting a friend so he would leave me alone 💀

but it’s not even just about safety stuff. it’s literally the *smallest* things too. like when i was little, me and my friends used to sit in a circle at recess braiding each other’s hair and making little friendship bracelets 💕💜 and we’d tell each other secrets and giggle about crushes and idk… it’s just one of those things that amab ppl *don’t* get??? like they don’t grow up with that same kind of closeness, that soft little world of girlhood where you just *get* each other. it’s something you can’t really explain, but afabs just *know* what i mean.

and like this is something no one ever wants to talk about but amab ppl (yes even the ones who transition!!) were raised to take up space in a way we never were. like afabs grow up being told to be quiet, be nice, be accommodating—meanwhile amab kids are literally encouraged to speak up, be confident, say what’s on their mind without worrying abt how it’ll make ppl feel. and it SHOWS. like tell me why afabs in group convos will apologize before they even start talking while amab ppl will just say whatever’s on their mind without a second thought??? tell me why afabs are *so much more likely* to hesitate before correcting someone or standing their ground in an argument, while amab ppl don’t even blink before saying ""actually, i think you’re wrong"" like it's NOTHING!!!!! 😭

and like this happened *literally last week* and it’s been living rent-free in my head bc it’s just SO telling. i’m in this discord server for queer ppl (super diverse, really cool vibes) and we were having a convo abt boundaries in relationships. i typed this long thoughtful message abt how afabs especially tend to struggle w saying no bc we’re literally *trained* to be accommodating, and i swear *not even two minutes later* my transfem friend just JUMPS in like ""well actually i don’t think that’s true, i always say no when i need to!!"" and like... babes. i just sat there staring at the screen like. do you hear yourself. like GOOD FOR YOU but that is *literally the point*. it’s just so wild bc if an afab had said that i guarantee they’d be second-guessing themselves like ""oh idk if this is just me?? maybe i’m overthinking??"" but this girl just swooped in like her experience was universal and shut down the whole convo 😭😭 like the audacity omg.

and like obv no one is saying trans women don’t struggle (literally who is saying that omg) but when you’ve spent your whole childhood being *taught* to be confident, to speak up, to not second-guess yourself… that doesn’t just disappear overnight. it just *doesn’t*.

and i rly don’t get why this convo makes ppl so mad bc it’s NOT about invalidating anyone!!!!!!! it’s literally just about acknowledging that we don’t all start from the same place. we talk so much abt intersectionality and nuance until it’s time to actually apply it lol. like we *can* acknowledge that different socialization exists without erasing anyone’s struggles. both things can be true!!!!!!! 🤷‍♂️",7,1738729836.0,4tran4,11,0.77,False

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

The Importance of Personalization in Valentine’s Day Gifts
----------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to Valentine’s Day, the pressure to find the perfect gift can be overwhelming. With so many options available, how do you choose something that truly expresses your feelings? The answer lies in personalization. A customized gift not only shows effort but also indicates a deep understanding of your partner's likes and desires. Let’s explore why personalization is crucial in making your Valentine's gifts unforgettable.

### Understanding Your Partner's Style

Personalized gifts reflect your partner's unique personality and style. Here are some ways personalization adds value:

- **Thoughtful Touch:** A gift that caters specifically to your partner’s interests makes them feel valued and cherished.
- **Strengthened Connection:** Tailoring a gift to their tastes connects you on a deeper level, reinforcing emotional bonds.
- **Lasting Memories:** A custom gift accompanies special memories, reminding your partner of shared experiences every time they see or use it.

### Creative Personalized Gift Ideas

Here are some creative and thoughtful personalized gift ideas that will leave a mark:

- **Engraved Jewelry:** A piece of jewelry engraved with a meaningful date or message is a timeless gift that holds sentimental value.
- **Custom Love Coupons:** Create a booklet of love coupons your partner can redeem for activities like a movie night or a home-cooked dinner. Each coupon is a reminder of your special connection.
- **Photo Books:** Compile a collection of your favorite photographs together. Personalizing it with captions and memories transforms a simple photo book into a cherished keepsake.
- **Tailored Clothing:** Customized T-shirts, hoodies, or caps with inside jokes or memorable quotes bring joy and fun to your gift-giving.
- **Personalized Star Map:** Capture the night sky at a meaningful moment, such as your first date or wedding day. This unique piece of art serves as a romantic reminder.

### The Element of Surprise

A personalized gift carries an element of surprise, elevating the excitement of unwrapping. Imagine your partner's delight as they uncover a gift that resonates with their heart. Tailoring a gift based on shared memories or inside jokes can make it even more impactful. It shows you’ve truly listened and paid attention to their preferences, further strengthening your relationship.

### Affordable and Accessible Options

Some may think personalized gifts require a hefty budget, but that’s not always the case. Here are some affordable yet meaningful options:

- **Handwritten Letters:** Pour your heart out and express your feelings in a heartfelt letter. Pair it with a photo of a meaningful moment shared together.
- **Custom Playlist:** Curate a playlist of songs that remind you of your partner. This gift is not only free but also thoughtful, showing you care.
- **DIY Gifts:** Consider making something yourself—like a scrapbook or a painted canvas—to add a personal touch and save money.

### Building Anticipation

Personalization doesn’t just end with the gift; it can also extend to the way you present it. Think about how you can create an experience around giving the gift. Maybe you could send a series of clues leading up to the main surprise. This elevates a simple gift into a cherished event that you both will remember fondly.

### Improving Emotional Connection

Ultimately, personalized gifts foster a more profound emotional connection between you and your partner. They symbolize your commitment to each other. Personalization shows that you’re not just giving a gift; you’re sharing a piece of your heart. It's these thoughtful gestures that create an atmosphere of love, making Valentine's Day even more special.

In a world brimming with off-the-shelf gifts, taking the time to personalize your Valentine’s presents can make all the difference. The choices you make reflect your feelings, and a well-chosen, customized gift can become a cherished reminder of your love. This Valentine’s Day, let your gift speak volumes through personalization—it’s a beautiful way to express just how much your partner means to you.

### Conclusion

Valentine’s Day is an opportunity to celebrate love in all its forms, and choosing the right gift can make a significant impact. From thoughtful gestures for new relationships to meaningful tokens for long-term partners, understanding the importance of the relationship stage can help you select gifts that resonate deeply. Creative Valentine gift ideas tailored to each phase—be it a simple handwritten note or an experience to share together—can truly enhance the occasion.

Moreover, personalization plays a vital role in transforming an ordinary gift into something extraordinary. Adding a personal touch shows you care and have put thought into your choice. Whether it’s customizing a piece of jewelry, selecting a favorite book, or crafting a photo album filled with shared memories, these gestures speak volumes.

Valentine’s Day is not just about extravagant displays of affection; it is about acknowledging the uniqueness of your bond. By considering both the stage of your relationship and the power of personalized gifts, you can create memorable moments that deepen connections. This Valentine’s Day, aim to choose gifts that reflect not only your feelings but also the special journey you share. After all, the essence of love lies in the thought and intention behind each gift. So, as you plan your celebration, remember that heartfelt authenticity often makes the most lasting impression.

I'm currently on my Day 22 of trying to quit caffeine (although I kind of relapsed around Day 16 but it simply convinced me to pursue a caffeine-less lifestyle from now on because the one cup of coffee I drank caused heart palpitations and hand tremors like I've never experienced before) and I have started to crave candy and chocolates a lot. I'm quite scared because although I had figured out that it might simply just be my body regulating where I get my energy from in a day so I indulged the cravings during the beginning without much thought but now I am starting to think this might be a withdrawal symptom? Possibly related to dopamine levels being affected by the caffeine loss? Or is it more so psychological with your brain trying to swap out one addiction with another?

1ii1sap,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductivityApps/comments/1ii1sap/voicefirst_todo_app_a_simple_solution_for_daily/,Voice-First Todo App - A Simple Solution for Daily Tasks,"Hey everyone!

I want to share something personal that turned into an app. Early 2024, I found myself drowning in todos - work tasks, random ideas, meeting notes, and those ""I should remember this"" moments. The problem wasn't organizing tasks (we have plenty of tools for that), it was capturing them quickly enough before they slipped away.

I kept thinking: ""Why do I need to stop what I'm doing, open an app, and type everything out?"" That's when the idea for Flowtica hit me - what if I could just speak my thoughts and have them automatically organized?

So I built it. A todo app that's voice-first, not voice-as-an-afterthought. The core idea is simple: speak your task, and it's captured. No typing, no app-switching, no friction.

What surprised me most was how it changed my daily rhythm. Those random thoughts during my morning coffee? Captured. Action items during a walk? Logged. Meeting follow-ups? Done before leaving the room. My friends who tried it had similar experiences - it just feels more natural.

Key features that made the difference:  
• Instant voice-to-todo conversion  
• Smart voice search across all tasks  
• Clean, distraction-free interface  
• Quick task organization

I'm opening up beta testing because I believe others might find it helpful too. This isn't about replacing your favorite todo app - it's about trying a different approach to managing daily chaos.

If you're interested in trying it out, just drop a comment or DM me. I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback!

Thanks for reading! ☺️
