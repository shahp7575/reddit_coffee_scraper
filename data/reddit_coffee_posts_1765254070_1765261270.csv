1pi09vc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1pi09vc/to_h_the_one_i_pushed_away/,To H: the one I pushed away,"You won’t see this because you don’t have Reddit but I decided I wanted to journal on here instead of my actual journal.

I’m not sure if you were even real. Part of me thinks someone was playing a cruel joke on me. Maybe someone who knows you asked you to do this to me.. Getting me to go all-in and then pulling the rug out from under me in the form of massively decreased communication and attention. I could be so very wrong though. I don’t know. You could have just been really busy. I’m not sure. I don’t really know what happened.. except that I did what I do best. I ran.

What I do know though? Is that the 60ish days we got to know each other on Tellonym was perfect. Asking each other questions and answering. Talking all day. Then that phone call where we stayed up on the phone until about 3am. Your voice will forever be one that will haunt me. Because I miss you. 

I’m sorry that I pushed you away. My ocd did a really great job at convincing me you did not want me due to the lack of communication/attention in the end. My ocd is a massive flaw. And I did warn you that I shut down if I’m feeling hurt. I crawl into a cozy “cave” full of books, my cat, warm blankets, coffee, documentaries. And then, once I feel the hurt lessening its grip on me, I come out of my “cave” a bit to explore. And by that time of course, usually at least, the other person gave up on me. It’s okay though.. It would be frustrating to deal with. 

I’m not an easy girl to have a connection with. I’m sorry for that. Maybe one day our paths will cross again. Maybe it won’t. All I know is your voice will haunt my days for the foreseeable future. 

I’m sorry. And I miss you.

1pi05hq,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1pi05hq/done_getting_burned_by_bad_wifi_advice/,"Done getting burned by bad wifi, advice?","As a digital nomad, one of the most frustrating rituals is this: you walk into a coffee shop, buy a drink, sit down, open your laptop, and the WiFi is unusable. This happens to me all the time (lol).

So I started running actual speed tests everywhere I worked: cafés, hostels, coworking spaces, and even random hotels, just to see if any real patterns showed up. These are definitely generalizations and will vary by country and city, but here’s the “safe map” I’ve built for myself so far:

\- Hostels are the most unpredictable. Common areas are often fine early in the day, then completely collapse at night. Dorms and even private rooms usually share the same overloaded network.

\- Hotels are more reliable than hostels, but usually only “just good enough.” Even luxury hotels will have average connections.

\- Coworking spaces were by far the most consistent, but they get expensive fast, especially if you move cities often.

\- Chain cafes were usually “safe enough,” while independent spots were either fantastic or completely unusable, almost no middle ground. For work reliability, Starbucks beat the local “Morning Roast” way more often than I wanted (hate to admit it). Cafes with great reviews still regularly had unusable upload speeds, which matters way more for video calls than download.

Star ratings and comments like “great WiFi” are basically meaningless without real numbers. It’s always hit or miss no matter where you are.

If I absolutely need reliable internet to get real work done, my personal order is:

coworking space -> chain cafe -> hotel -> local cafe -> hostel

Do people have similar experiences or is this just me?

I’ve started experimenting with a crowdsourced WiFi speed map so people can see live speeds near them instead of guessing. It’s early, I can share if there is enough interest, but don't want to spam. I'm really looking for advice on having more consistency when picking a place to work.",0,1765260804.0,remotework,0,0.5,False

1pi03gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1pi03gk/ca_imagine_being_harassed_at_work_and_hr_tells/,[CA] Imagine being harassed at work and HR tells YOU to be friendlier,"Has anyone else experienced management trying to micromanage an HR professional after a harassment case, and how did you handle it?

In my role as an HR professional at a medium-sized financial firm, the figures may align, but the gender dynamics are severely out of balance. While my official duties involve employee relations, policy enforcement, and preventing the company from imploding due to inflated egos, I've inadvertently become the go-to person for any senior employee who views HR as a synonym for ""a woman they can bother."" Initially, everything appeared standard and professional. But then, subtle remarks began. A senior analyst, the type who believes a CFA designation elevates him to a superior being, repeatedly found excuses to visit my office. Initially, it was seemingly harmless inquiries he could have simply emailed. However, it soon escalated to ""jokes,"" compliments, and comments about my attire. He'd launch into lengthy monologues about his preference for ""confident women,"" all while scrutinizing me as if I were a data point in his quarterly report. I consistently shut it down, employing a firm, direct, and professional demeanor. It's the same tone I use when declining last-minute PTO requests, to be sure. Yet, he persisted in pushing the boundaries, week after week. It got to the point where other employees were telling me they noticed his behavior and thought it was inappropriate. Imagine being HR and having to HR your own harassment case. The irony isn’t lost on me. When I finally escalated it formally because clearly, being polite wasn’t registering for him management acted shocked. Shocked. As if the man didn’t have a reputation older than the company’s coffee machine. And of course, instead of dealing with him directly, they started tiptoeing around me like I’m the problem. As if my refusal to entertain his midlife-crisis flirting somehow disrupted productivity. Then the real fun started: suddenly my “tone” was an issue. My “attitude” was “alienating.” I was “too rigid” enforcing policies. One director even implied that if I were friendlier, maybe the analyst wouldn’t have “misread the situation.” I nearly laughed in his face. Misread what? The no’s? The boundaries? The HR badge on my door? Anyway, I filed everything by the book. They didn’t like that. A week later, I found out they “restructured” my responsibilities. No more direct oversight, no more independence, and suddenly my calendar was full of pointless check-ins meant to “support my professional growth.” Please. They’re hoping I quit quietly instead of making noise.

But here’s the twist: I’m not leaving. Not yet.

I know my rights. I know their policies better than they do. And unlike them, I’m not afraid of documentation. They can glare, gossip, and micromanage all they want I’ve built a case thicker than their quarterly reports. Every time I remember how desperately they tried to make me the issue, I just shake my head. Half the men are the clowns. And yes, I’m still showing up every day in heels, perfect hair, and the confidence they keep calling “unprofessional.” If that bothers them, they can file a complaint.",0,1765260621.0,AskHR,0,0.4,False

1pi013e,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Far-Language5233/comments/1pi013e/the_most_famous_and_best_handrub_mist_spray/,The Most Famous and Best Hand-Rub Mist Spray,"In everyday moments - when being tidy matters just as much as speed or ease - a few quiet helpers handle key tasks at home or work without fanfare. Take two common ones: Mineral Oil Food Grade and Hand-Rub Mist Spray that kill germs - they pop up nearly everywhere since folks trust them to do their job gently. Rather than hurrying through cooking chores, imagine treating your chopping block with one; while the other nukes unseen bugs after you touch light switches or phones. Together, they fit smoothly into routines, bringing small but sure protection over time.

**Benefits of Mineral Oil Food Grade**

A major perk? Mineral oil that’s safe for food use is super reliable. After a good wash, it avoids strong chemicals - making it fine to handle around eating areas, even if spills happen. With no chance of dangerous leaks, people trust it in restaurants, cooking spots, or coffee shops where cleanliness really matters.

Mineral oil labeled food-safe keeps kitchen machines running smooth - less rubbing means parts don’t break down fast. They glide past each other, thanks to a slick layer that forms between them. On top of this, dampness gets blocked, which blocks rust too; that way tools stay strong and won’t jam up or split after long use.

This oil works well because it protects while nourishing different materials. Apply it to items like chopping boards, meat blocks, or wood tools - it sinks deep, avoiding splits, holding water in, but also blocking germs from growing. Using it often helps surfaces stay slick and fresh, fights tiny organisms, plus makes them last longer with a better look over time.

[Hand-Rub Mist Spray](https://preview.redd.it/varq6npbd46g1.png?width=170&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d8de5992b70352888edd9c9c444cdebdc44b69f)

Mineral oil food grade works just about anywhere - try it when cooking, around work areas, near garden setups, even on skin. Slap it on without stress - it spreads smooth, no stink sticks behind, zero marks show up, stays tidy whether you're chopping veggies or fixing tools. Because it's that easy to handle, pros and regular folks grab it now and then.

A big perk? Keeps gunk, dampness, or rust from creeping inside. Because of this trick, it helps keep delicate areas clean - plus shields food items too. Freshens hands fast - no sink required. Built for busy times, fits right into your day without hassle, even if you're parked at a desk, picking up food, or packed on a bus. One quick spray kills unseen bugs, keeps you covered in seconds.

These days, wipe-on sprays have gentle mixes that won't leave skin feeling parched or raw. Yet, they still blast germs without issue. Because they guard against nastiness while holding onto moisture, people tend to reapply them often during daily routines.

Hand-rub mists work well at wiping out nasty bugs. Because they stop germs in their tracks, you’re less likely to get sick. Using them often keeps things clean while also looking out for folks nearby.

The small shape of mist sprays means they’re simple to bring along - so you stay cooled down no matter where you are. Toss it in your backpack, letting you beat the heat while hustling, moving between places, or kicking back outside. There are many facts about the best [**Mineral Oil Food Grade**](https://www.loyalgel.com/product/mineral-oil-food-grade/), or Hand-Rub Mist Spray that you must know.

Faster than most cleaners, these sprays dry fast - no gunk left behind. Instantly, there's a cool tingle, yet defense keeps up; this makes them easy to handle while feeling nice. Mineral oil made safe for food surfaces works alongside spray cleaners to tackle daily spills without dragging your pace. As the oil shields utensils and gear from damage, the fog kills bacteria fast while giving skin a refreshing feel wherever you go. Used differently, they still win confidence through easy use and steady results - helping guard your health and keep things running smoother, at home or during work hours. Go ahead! And claim the top benefits of the Mineral Oil Food Grade, or Hand-Rub Mist Spray.

A few months later, his business wasn't doing well and he put his hundred percent into his work. I respected it, and I gave him space 
But I was always there for him whether it was cooking for him or just going over when he was available. he spends a lot of time at the gym and he told me it helps with the stress. i also started going to the gym to spend some time with him.

today he asked me if I was going to the gym and I said yes, and I went there. he called me an hour in and asked me where I was. I told him I was upstairs. he said OK he's working out downstairs and I told him I'm about to leave because I've been here for an hour and a half now he said OK. He didn't acknowledge to see me or even come upstairs to say bye. I noticed he was so into his workout. I just left without meeting him. he didn't call or say anything all night. this is the third or fourth time this has happened usually I'm the one who goes up to him. I also have been initiating small things like going out for coffee or lunch. he's always at work 12 to 14 hours a day. when we're together, he is usually working on his phone.

Yes, he checks in and only invites me over when he is available. there are times where he goes downstairs and eats with his roommates while leaving me upstairs in the room. yeah so asked me if I had dinner and usually I do eat before I go over.

She is pretty hard to shop for as she doesn’t really have any hobbies and HATES gift cards. She is 63 years old. Budget is around $100. 

Things she likes
1- reading thrillers
2- collecting gingerbread knick knacks
3- general wellness (has Fitbit and such)

Things she’s NOT in to
1- gardening
2- crafts
3- cooking
4- makeup / spa stuff
5- bags purses
6- jewelry
7- coffee or tea
8- shoes or clothes
9- technology

So she has very limited hobbies and I already got her a ton of books and some gingerbread decoration last year and others get her a new Fitbit. I try to look up “gifts for moms” or “gifts for moms with no hobbies” and it always does stuff like heated mugs, heated blankets, slippers, spa stuff, gardening or cooking, or any of the other things I listed and she doesn’t like those. The only things I can think of either she already got last year or would be kind of borderline offensive to give. And I can’t just give a gift card she’d rather have nothing.

Do you guys have any hot tips to help me out? I was thinking I could try and get her in a new hobby or something but that’s risky and I don’t want it to just sit on a shelf knowing she won’t like it or want to try it. Any pointers are greatly appreciated.

A couple years after we graduated, Jason messaged me out of the blue saying that he missed talking, and asked if we could make a scheduled day out of the week where we talked, played video games, or anything really. I really enjoyed our time together in college so agreed, and we’ve been hanging out once a week every Tuesday for the better part of 3 years.

While these weekly chats were going on, I met my girlfriend Eleanor (at the time F17, now F21) while at a summer job. We were friends with benefits for several months, but eventually I caught feelings and asked her out. Turns out she had feelings for me basically the whole time and was just waiting for me to grow a pair. We were long distance for a while after that as she lived in Nevada while I lived in Arizona, but after several months I had a hard think about it and decided to move in with her as I was already graduated, while she was still in college and would’ve been giving up a lot more. I was still pretty nervous about it all though, and after talking with Jason about it all he admitted to wanting to move too, so we agreed to do it together alongside his own girlfriend Janet. Eleanor wasn’t so sure about it all, but I was unwilling to move alone forcing her to move into a rental house with us.

Things started out pretty good, with Jason and I continuing our Tuesday sessions now in-person. But that summer four separate members of Eleanor’s extended family died along with her family’s dog. This sent her down a really depressive rabbit hole culminating in her spending most of her time between work and school, with any remaining time at the house holed up in the bedroom. Several incidents happened that caused a lot of bad blood between us two couples, and eventually Eleanor and I decided to break the lease and moved out to a new apartment.

My relationship with Jason took a tank, but we eventually worked through it. Eleanor, however, ended up suffering severe extended trauma and developed PTSD symptoms any time Jason or Janet came up in conversation, such that I stopped telling her about what it was that he and I might’ve done on our Tuesday meetings.

Throughout it all, Eleanor had consistently been going to her favorite coffeeshop. She found it during high school, and had been going at least once a week to study and do homework, including during the rental ordeals. She had become friends with most of the baristas, and would gossip with them about her classes, work, and of course all the drama. While the stress kept piling on, the shop was her safe space where she could go to get away from it all.

Eventually, the lease on the house ran out, and Jason and Janet decided to move to a new place where the rent would be a lot cheaper. Unfortunately, that new place was just a few streets over from the coffee shop. I didn’t tell Eleanor about it since I didn’t want to trigger her PTSD, and figured they probably wouldn’t meet. That hope was dashed when she bumped into them a few months later going into the shop that triggered her trauma all over again, and we ended up having a huge fight over it. When it happened a second time a few months after, she asked me if I could talk to them about staying away. At first I told her that was unreasonable and she agreed, but knowing how stressed she was getting I decided to try and ask them if they could at least keep away Sunday through Wednesday.

Last week I talked to Jason, and after a while we planned to call to discuss everything further. Those call plans fell through, but he did send me a long text to get everything off his chest, including that he would not be willing to accommodate Eleanor’s wishes. I sent a text back telling him why I asked at all, and if he would please find it within himself to give her a few days where she could know she was safe. He still wasn’t willing, and told me to consult other people, which leads me to here. I’ve been talking to coworkers about it all, but also wanted to get some strangers’ more objective opinions.

We’ve been dating for about three months. The concern is his approach to dieting.

He lost around 50 pounds previously. I have a sense that he may have self-esteem issues that stem from his previous weight. He often complains about how dating was hard for him before and says that his weight/looks was holding him back. For reference, I am his first girlfriend. 

Onto the dieting. He occasionally follows a very extreme form of keto. He eats almost no carbs and very limited fats. He will eat canned chicken and green beans, or a mixture of protein powder and cinnamon mostly. He will avoid any foods that will have too high of a calorie count to be in a deficit. He will drink coffee and a lot of Coke Zero. I’m talking a 2 liter bottle a day. He did this diet a few weeks ago claiming he was preparing for thanksgiving before he had to see his family so they don’t judge him. He did not last in the diet and began eating normally. He is now on the diet again. I asked him how often he plans on doing this and he said every six months for three weeks. This diet affects his libido and mood. He claims when he’s on the diet it’s hard for him to “get there”. The diet also makes his breath stink, but I’m not sure if it’s keto breath or the copious amount of Coke zero. He says he has a goal of reaching 129 pounds. He is 5’8 for reference.

I’m worried because this diet does not seem healthy, even if he only plans to do it every six months. I’m concerned about his well-being and our relationship long-term. I can’t imagine dealing with this every six months.

I've gone so far as to end our relationship and have donstaned myself as much as possible. L is currently trying to blackmail me and threatening to tell my parents but I've threatened to expose her actions to her son I've also gathered a recording where she openly blackmails and tries to guilt trip me into staying in a relationship with her.

Then I moved on to autopilot-type algorithms that automatically adjusted parameters toward desired values. 

But my latest experiment turned out very well. A tiny ML model (only a few kilobytes) calculates the preheat based on bean weight, predicts first crack with an accuracy of up to 10 seconds, and estimates how long the roast will take. It makes predictions every few seconds and adjusts the power and fan accordingly. I’ve been roasting with it for a month now, and after more than 50 roasts, I don’t think about how to roast anymore - just charge the beans, and it automatically adjusts the parameters.

I don’t even know why it makes certain decisions, but all my friends and I love the roasts more than ever before. I want to improve the model in the near future and add more custom settings, control over phase lengths, and so on.

I (19m) live with a couple (21f and 22m) while we’re in college (tbf I’m basically not going anymore but that’s neither here nor there). I work full-time, 21f works a handful of hours on campus a week, and 22m works two part-time jobs. They pay 2/3 rent together and I pay 1/3 rent.

Now we do not have a big apartment. We have our two bedrooms and the common area consisting of the living room, dining table, kitchen, and bathroom. That’s it. They have the big room cause duh, while I get this little room that could at most fit two single beds. 

Ever since we’ve moved in together there’s just a few things nagging on me:

(1) they’re always—and I mean ALWAYS in the common area. 21f (let’s just say Jen) sometimes goes to school/work and sometimes just skips entirely, and if she’s not there she’s in the living room. Every time. On the couch or doing some project in the only large space this place has. Her and 22m (Mack we’ll say) don’t sleep until well into the night, usually close to 2 fucking am. And they’re awake super early too, so even if Jen is out Mack’s in there studying or something. I quite literally never get any solitary time in the area, which I would like seeing as my room is, ahem, tiny (and also kitchen access + the living room tv is bigger than my bedroom one).

(2) Jen is lowkey toxic, she’s said to me when we considered getting a fourth roomie that she “needs to maintain [her] equity over the house to feel secure and in charge” and thinks she gets to just do whatever in shared spaces and make final decisions. Tbf so does Mack, to a lesser degree. I wanna reorganize a bit? Nope. I want to put up a small curtain just to cut off the ugly hallway from the common area? Taken down. I don’t like the furniture layout? Womp womp I guess. I do make a change? I get confronted about it and yet know that if I confronted them about any of the shit they do that annoys me (constantly keeping the coffees and dining tables cluttered, not actually cleaning off the kitchen counters whenever they cook, etc.) I’d once again get yelled at.

(3) They make noise. All. The. Time. We’re in an upper apartment so I have to remind them to be quiet cause people live below us, and they still ignore that and will get rowdy when we have friends over at midnight. Or use the blender. Or use the vacuum. I’ve said multiple times not to, I never make that much noise past 8pm (once or twice used a blender for cooking, but never more than that), and I have still been told “I could never be that considerate” by Jen. Like wow

(4) We’re having a mutual friend stay with us for a bit, and the rule has just been to let each other know before someone’s going to. We don’t really have a permission thing cause if I want a guy over then duh, yeah, and if they want a friend over for the night then whatever. The thing is, they didn’t tell me until days after it was planned that he’s staying for a full week. Like c’mon

(5) Privacy, privacy, privacy… found out they were “jokingly” checking my car the other day and fully just opened the door and sat in, and I’m almost certain they’ve been snooping in my bedroom. Like… c’mon. 

(6) Maybe a bit of a pet peeve, but whenever they shower both of them end up leaving water on the floors of our bathroom. I always dry before leaving the actual shower and dress in there, but whenever I go to use the loo after they’ve showered I have to evade puddles like it’s some fucking game.

(7) I pay internet—and I’m fine with it, but they basically made me buy better internet just so they can game. Our other internet worked fine, but they both want to game super hardcore at 11pm most nights so they “need good ping”. Like cmon. Cmon. 

(8) Mack acts like he works the most… and he does work a ton, but also—Jen does virtually all of his schoolwork aside from exams and his actual weekly hours just straight up aren’t hitting 40 most weeks. I easily make the most here (and tbf spend the most, but that’s part of the reason I’m trying to get into OT most weeks). Jen likes to remind us she doesn’t work a ton and then proceeds to just chill on the couch, and yes she does end up doing a lot of the house work. I appreciate it a ton. I try to keep up too, doing the floors as regularly as possible, wiping stuff down, and de-cluttering.

(9) Kind of a continuation, I get berated when I clean cause it’s not to their style. Like I’m sorry but I genuinely don’t care about some of the stuff they do, I clean for the sake of actual cleanliness and space openness and that’s it. If nothing’s at risk of being a health hazard, then dust and shit isn’t bothering me. 

Should I even bring this up? We’re planning to live together for a while yet cause of other shit or something, but that’s neither here nor there (would love to be able to live at home but whatever) and with my schooling being on pause (mental health or whatever) I’ve just been working a shit ton, trying to go to the gym, and doing whatever tf I can despite depression kicking my ass. I’m trying to keep the peace, but among so much other stuff on my mind it’s starting to get to me. ",1,1765258542.0,badroommates,8,0.99,False

On a Monday night, when the rest of the world is unwinding from the weekend, these individuals seem to be embroiled in an intense session of lamentation. One can only imagine the air thick with unique grievances about their latest tech endeavors, as they sip their coffees brewed from machine parts, lamenting the complexities of their self-built mini radar systems.

These so-called high-tech aficionados enjoy a veritable treasure trove of radar radio gain in their makeshift offices, a testament to their DIY spirit and innovative touches when it comes to technology. However, it seems that in their quest for technological prowess, they may have lost touch with the basics of daily life—one might humorously suggest that some of them are struggling with the simpler intricacies of self-care, like mastering the art of personal hygiene.

One can't help but ponder how on Earth these tech-savvy individuals gained access to such secure spaces. And as for the financial aspects of this technological playground, one can only speculate about the shocking amount of money the Air Force allocates for electricity each month to support their seemingly endless power needs. It's hard not to feel a twinge of sympathy for these researchers and engineers; my thoughts are with them as they navigate this precarious blend of high-tech exploits and the whims of everyday life.

I've never had a Pache before. This seems like another super small microlot.

Mount Totumas Coffee won 1st Place at the 2023 Best of Panama in the Geisha Natural category and maintained an impressive standing as 6th Place Geisha Natural Auction Lot in 2024.

Established in 2008 by the Dietrich brothers, Jeff and Michael, initially as a an off-the-grid, rustic luxe, cloud forest lodge on 140 hectares bordering Central America’s largest highland national park, La Amistad, Mount Totumas was encouraged toward high-end coffee cultivation by neighboring fincas with decades of expertise in producing award-winning Panama Geisha, evinced by decorated track records in the Best of Panama.

Mentored by Ratibor and Tessie Hartmann of the acclaimed Finca Hartmann family legacy, the Dietrich family planted their first 500 Panama Geisha trees in 2014. To date, they have 10,000 coffee trees including Caturra, Catuai, and Typica flourishing at altitudes 1800 masl and higher, amid the legendary, biodiverse, and canopied Chiriqui terroir.

Under the leadership of Jeff’s daughter, Karin de la Rosa who steers operations according to their philosophy of holistic, ecologically-oriented specialty coffee production, as well as the support of his wife Alma, Mount Totumas is poised to continue playing an important part in endearing the most discerning connoisseurs to the Panama Geisha.

1phzaue,https://archive.ph/scU0a,Dr. Oz Tells His Federal Employees to Eat Less,"Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and former daytime talk show star, has recently been emailing all federal workers in his agency weekly tips on “Crushing Cubicle Cravings” and how to avoid snacking in the office.

“We all love a fun cookie swap and potluck this time of year. With several teams across CMS hosting holiday gatherings this month, I am sharing some strategies to help you make healthier choices—while still indulging in festive treats,” Oz wrote in his latest missive, which appears as a recurring section in his weekly bulletin titled “From the Administrator’s Desk,” according to emails viewed by WIRED.

“Set your intentions,” writes Oz. “Decide in advance how many treats you’ll allow yourself to enjoy and try to stick to that number. You don’t have to try every cookie on the cookie table.”

His email continues with further guidance: “practice portion control,” “be mindful,” and “don’t double fist,” he tells the agency’s more than 6,000 employees. He advises subordinates to “eat off a small plate when you can and take small portions of treats so you can enjoy them without overeating,” to eat more slowly (“Savor each bite, put your fork down between bites, and pay attention to your body’s cues,” he counsels), and not to hold food and beverages in more than one hand so as to free up “the other for shaking hands with colleagues and friends during this festive period.”

This kind of advice has appeared in Oz’s emails since early November.

In the past, Oz has promoted a number of unproven medical tips surrounding weight loss. He at one time pushed weight-loss solutions that he subsequently admitted in a 2014 Senate subcommittee hearing “don’t have the scientific muster to present as fact.” (Oz had promoted one such product on his show as “magic,” claiming, “You may think magic is make-believe, but this little bean has scientists saying they’ve found the magic weight-loss cure for every body type—it’s green coffee extract.”)

Oz, who has also shared incorrect information about the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as a treatment for Covid, had not seemingly worked in health care policy before taking over as CMS administrator this year. CMS oversees the provision of health care coverage for more than 160 million people. Current CMS employees have described the agency to WIRED as “the most policy-dense organization in government,” where the CMS administrator makes decisions on where to spend billions of dollars in a high stakes environment. As the administrator of CMS, Oz works under health care conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who currently serves as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Oz worked as a physician before becoming the star of The Dr. Oz Show, where he also spoke at length about healthy eating during the holidays. In that case, however, he was sharing his opinion with interested fans, as opposed to government employees obligated to receive his emails.

In his first “crushing cubicle cravings” email, Oz claimed employees had requested these tips. “I’m bringing one of your ideas to the newsletter,” Oz wrote. “From now through the holidays, I’ll share tips for healthy snacking. You don’t need to wait for a New Year’s resolution to form healthy habits!” He continued, advising employees that “healthy snacking starts with Sunday meal prep. Prepare grab-and-go containers of nutritious snacks…eating healthy snacks—like those high in protein and fiber—throughout the work day will keep you energy up and help suppress overeating, especially when there's leftover Halloween candy at every turn.”

In subsequent emails, Oz advised employees to drink water and eat a balanced breakfast.",1,1765257874.0,WhatTrumpHasDone,0,1.0,False

Hope you all Enjoy!)

My name is Kaitlyn (22f), I live in a rural town in the deep woods of Montana. I moved here because the surrounding area was more appealing to me than the cities on the East Coast. It was my first winter here and it was hard to adjust. I got a job at a local gas station on the outskirts of the town. The locals have always seemed friendly but we all know how locals feel about big city people showing up in their small towns.

Starting at Marties (the gas station) was simple and easy. They stuck me on mid-shift so I would leave just before it got dark. There's not much to talk about the station. We had four pumps, they had a very vintage feel to them because there was no digital screen, the first time I'd seen ones like that. Inside we had three rows of random assortments as well as two walls of fridge/freezer doors. Then of course we had the soda machine which only served Pepsi products, not my favorite choice.

The area around the station was beautiful. There was a single-lane road that ran past with moderate traffic from tourists or other locals. When I got to work, the smell of fresh pine and morning dew always hit my nose. It was as if being there was such a mental pallet cleanser. Other than that there was a small storage/garage area out back next to the trash bin. The only stuff kept in there were tools to fix stuff if the mechanics couldn't come out, or in case someone's car broke down and needed a jump.

I had a few interesting co-workers, well three. There was Jim, he was your typical small-town stoner guy. He was always relaxed and went with the flow but always smelled like he just climbed out of a pile of dirt. Then there was Brenda, she was a mother of three and was a mother to everyone that worked there. Her only downside was smelling and puffing out smoke like an old train. Then there was Wayne, Wayne looked like a very mature typical country boy. He wore his button-up shirt with his blue jeans and boots. His hair was short and black that framed his face along with the light stubble around his chin. It's what every city girl dreams of and boy did I dream about him.

Now that I've told you a little bit of what is going on it's time we get to why I'm here writing this out for you. So I've been here for three weeks now, enough time to build up somewhat of a relationship with others in town. And as it turns out there's a fall/winter concert kind of party that goes down at the Harris farm every year. People from the surrounding towns would all gather here and have one big party. I was invited the first time I've ever been invited anywhere. So I planned and got the day off and cleared. And I couldn't wait to go to my first real party.

I had the location ready on my phone, I was texting in between stages telling my friends how excited I was about this. Just as I finished getting my hair done and my eyeliner perfect my phone rang. Glancing over I expected it to be the girls at the party, But it was Wayne who was calling me, I froze for a second, sure we have talked before but why was he calling me now? So I picked up the phone and answered.

Kaitlyn: ""Hey Wayne, what's up? Shouldn't you be at work by now?""

Wayne: ""Howdy Kaitlyn, you are right but that's what I'm callin’ bout. I've had a sudden issue with family and I need to leave for a few hours and wanted to know if you could cover for me?."" At this point my heart kind of dropped, I was so excited for this party but I was also torn because of how much I wanted him to like me.

Kaitlyn: ""What happened to Jim or Brenda? Or one of the others?""

Wayne: ""Well I tried calling them both but neither answered. I'm sure Jim’ll be too high to figure out how his phone works or he's asleep. And you know Brenda is probably also asleep after dealin’ with those kids she's got.""

Kaitlyn: ""I'm not sure honestly, I can probably come in for a few hours."" saying reluctantly. Wayne: ""Listen I know how much it means to you but I wouldn't be asking if I had any other choice I'll make it up to you I swear.""

Kaitlyn: ""Alright Alright but you owe me big. I'll see you in a few.""

We both said goodbye and hung up, I immediately gave out a drastic sigh and began finding, putting on my work clothes. I hurried because Wayne was waiting on me now. The faster I got there the faster he could get back. Finally getting ready I grabbed my keys and my jacket and headed out the door. My old car fought me in the cold. When it roared to life, I drove to Marties.

As I pulled into Marties, I could see Wayne prepping the shelves inside. Stepping out of my car and locking it I began to see snow fall from the sky. Enchanted by the sight of snow for the first time (right lame I know) I heard the doors slide open. Wayne was staring at me with a smile that said ""You having fun?"" and somehow ""Hurry up."" Wayne: ""Having fun watching snowfall?"" It was said with a tone issuing patience was faltering. Kaitlyn: "" Right sorry I've never seen snow before just kinda caught me off guard."" responding on my way inside.

Wayne: ""First time seeing snow? Well, you are gonna see a lot of it this year."" I heard behind me heading for the backroom to clock in.

Walking in the TV was talking about the current storm coming in. It seemed a lot of the area was going to get hit including mine. obviously I'd tell myself looking out the window. Snapping back to reality I quickly clocked in the familiar click of the old-school punch card machine ringing. Then out to talk to Wayne I went. I was stalling too much at this point.

Kaitlyn: ""Alright I know you are in a hurry but give me the rundown."" I noticed he was already putting his coat on but no gloves like a true country boy.

Wayne: ""Well, I haven't been busy. Maybe four or five customers make sense with the party going on. Maybe take out the trash in an hour or so? It will give you something to do. But I have to leave"" He said heading for the door but stopped to turn to look at me. ""Kaitlyn again thank you for this. I appreciate it.""

And with that, he was gone and off to his car. His words gave me a surge of warmth. I just hope he didn't see how red my cheeks got. I watched his car leave from the window and began to look around the empty store. It was my first time being alone this late at night here and it was kind of peaceful. Walking over to the windows of the front of the store I watched the snow fall ever so slowly outside completely entranced with the small movements.

Snapping out of the little hypnosis the snowfall brought on me I began to walk the store seeing if Wayne had left anything for me to face. There were a few that seemed like he tried but was in a hurry which made sense. Fixing the small issues I made my way back to the storage area. Grabbing the push cart I piled an assortment of products on top of the exact number that I needed for the spots I'd seen open. My memory has always been next level. My mother used to tell me I made an elephant's memory look like a goldfish's. With that i went out and started placing the stock in its own place.

Placing the last can of dog food on the shelf letting it slip in on top of the other can locking them in, I nodded to myself as I heard the familiar sound of the front door opening. Standing up I look over and notice it's Alice, a friend i was supposed to meet at the party and it smacks me as I realized I never told the group I was going to be late if I didn't miss the party all together. I wave to her shyly as her eyes get big with a smile then the look of confusion on her face.

Alice: “Kate why are you here? I thought you got tonight off for the party, remember?!” said with worry and irritation.

Kaitlyn: “Yes yes i know trust me i know. But Wayne said he had a family emergency and he called me.” Feeling defeated as I pushed my cart to the front while she headed towards the back where the fridges with beer and other adult drinks were located..

She shook her head as she pulled out a twenty four pack of her favorite and made her way to the front.

Alice: “Oh yes Mr country boy now it makes sense. You have been drooling over him since you got here. No, I get you girl just make sure he pays you back.” She said with a smile and a wink causing me to blush a little.

Just then another friend popped into the store. Her name was Heather. She came up asking why I was still here and I explained it to her just shorter this time because Alice cut me off saying “Wayne”. Heather knew right off the bat and gave a very over exaggerated face and display, Causing all three of us to laugh a bit.

They turned around to leave as they made their way to the door. It swung open and one of the older locals came in a bit tipsy already. As the two girls walked past he stopped and watched them with the creepy smile only an old man could do and said out loud for everyone to hear.

Creepy Old Man: “If I was forty years younger that would be the kind of tail I'd be chasing.”

Alice: “When you were our age you were chasing tails for the village to eat.” Alice had said as she scoffed at him.

They quickly left, leaving me alone with the man. He made his way slowly through the store after giving a non caring shrug. He made his way up to the counter and set his choice of candy and a beer in front of me and began fumbling for the cash he would need. Not much was said between us, I gave him the total and he gave me the cash. The change was exchanged and he turned around and left. And honestly i felt kind of insulted, i know i may not be the most attractive girl but he acted if i wasn't even there. I watched him walk out of the store and over to the side where the cars usually parked.

Walking out to grab my cart I felt a very uneasy feeling the kind you get that you are being watched. Like eyes somewhere are fixed on you like prey in the sights of a predator. I shivered at the feeling thinking maybe the old man was watching me. Maybe now he wanted to say something, looking around I didn't see anyone. But what caught my attention was across the street in the treeline where the snow lay piling up. Was a deer, he had no antlers but by his build it looked male. I'm not sure I'm from the city, but it felt like the deer was watching me. That made my skin crawl a bit too much and I made my way over to the window to see if I could get a better look. As I got to the window a car passed by at a high speed. It was the old man leaving finally but as he passed the deer as soon as the car was out of the line of sight the deer was gone. I was confused. I looked around the area to see if I just lost sight. But the deer was gone and no sign he was ever there.

I shook my head before noticing the buildup of snow and decided I should take out the trash now. Because if not then I would have to do it later in the deep snow. Heading for the back I stopped to grab the trash in the main register area replacing the bags. Then into the back I placed all the small bags I placed on the cart in the big trash. Pushing the cart back to its spot I pull out the big trash bag and make my way out back. I stop to admire the sight of the heavy falling snow. It was peaceful so serene movies or pictures never do it justice. A small quick rush of air brought me back and I headed over to the gate blocked trash can. I walked in between the two separated gates and lifted the lid up and over throwing the trash into the main dumpster then closed the lid. I dusted my hands off and nodded telling myself I did a good job.

The cold was settling in so I made my way outside the gated area to the main building. Stepping out only a few steps I was greeted with the sound of a sharp crash. Metal bending and scraping, it came from the shed next to me. My mind thought that the only thing it could be was a car who lost control had crashed into the side. I quickly ran over to the opposite side to help, I could hear what sounded like groaning. Maybe the old man had hit the shed? Sliding to a slow stop I looked to the now exposed side of the shed. There was no sign of impact, no sign of a car, glancing up I spotted the source of it all. The metal roof had caved in due to the snow fall. I'm sure after years of being out here it finally gave in and the wind moving the broken areas recreated the sound of groaning. Letting out a slight sigh, then went back inside.

Walking back I noticed all the lights flickering. And said to myself “it's as if this place never deals with snow.” Entering the building I was met with the sound of the store's phone ringing. I quickly made my way over to answer the phone. Picking it up and answering it, I was met with the worried voice of Wayne.

Kaitlyn: “Hello Thank you for calling Marties this is Kaitlyn how can i help you?”

Wayne: “Kaitlyn it's Wayne, I saw the power flicker and I forgot to tell you about the Backup generator.”

Kaitlyn: ”That's kind of a big thing to forget about you know?”

Wayne: ”Yeah i know i'm sorry, but there is a panel in the backroom labeled “Generator” all you have to do is make sure it's on setting two. That way if the power goes out and stays out for a bit it will kick on and the store will be good.”

Kaitlyn: “Oh ok so setting two? How long will it last? And when are you coming back?”

Wayne: “Yeah, setting two should last a few hours. If it goes out again, switch it to setting three. That's the backup tank; it's run off propane. And yeah, sorry, it's taking longer than I figured. I'm trying to get stuff situated here, but I'll text you and let you know when I'm on my way.”

And with that we said our goodbyes and I made my way to the back room. I was guessing the big complex power box with labels is what he meant. Reading over I found the correct switch and turned it over to two and heard an uneasy buzzing as things did what they needed to. The backroom didn't have much. There were the files, the panel, and the manager's computer. Jim told me the password a week ago in case I was on my break and wanted to watch the cameras. I typed in the password and pulled up the cameras. Looking over the options on the monitor I thought I spotted something out by the shed. It looked like the deer from earlier. And before I could get a better look a ring of a bell sounded from upfront causing me to look away for a moment. Glancing back the deer was gone and nothing in the snow showed footprints.

I walked up front and the local Mechanic/Carpenter Rod was standing out the counter bundled up with a coffee and snacks on the counter.

Rod: “Wait you are here? Where’s Wayne?” He said a bit curious and surprised to see me.

Kaitlyn: “Well he had a family thing go down I guess so I'm here till he gets back. When I was supposed to be at the big party."" I said sort of sarcastically and he nodded, grabbing his card to pay for his things.

Rod: “I'm actually on my way out there now for a call. I guess some girl either got her car stuck or broke it somehow. Who knows with these kids.” he chuckled a bit, grabbing his stuff and heading for the door. He stopped by the door, turned around and pointed out the door. “There's gonna be a guy named Sam he's gonna be here probably after a bit he's going around lookin’ for sights for a bear. I guess people have reported something big trying to get into their houses. So if a guy shows up with a hunting rifle it's ok.” I thanked him as he finally exited and I stood there thinking about the possibility of seeing my first bear before shaking off the sudden fear that followed shortly after.

I remembered I could have told him about the caved in roof but by the time I got to the door he was already driving off. I let out a sign and returned back to the register and grabbed a notebook labeled “important Notes”. It was there so that everyone on shift could read it for important notices or issues. It seemed nothing was new from the last time I saw it and I wrote about the issue with the shed. As I'm writing down in the notebook I had that feeling again that I was being watched. Like a strong uncomfortable feeling and it felt like it was being centered on the back of my neck. I tried to swat at it, maybe to make the feeling go away. But I turned around and saw nothing, just the wall with a clock and cigarettes on it. At this point of searching the wall a small sound caught my attention above me so I looked up at the plain ceiling tiles.

It sounded like something shuffling above but I brushed it off as just the snow moving and piling around on top. I made my way back to the storage area to grab a cleaner to clean the desk and windows. As I pushed the cart off to the side to reach for the cleaner, that's when I noticed that the sounds of shuffling above me seemed to follow where I was. Noticing this my heart began to race thinking maybe it was some creep who found his way into the ceiling and now he was watching me somehow. As my mind began to race with all kinds of possibilities it was interrupted with a loud and unsettling crash. It came from outside and I felt that if a car was going to crash into a shed that's what it would sound like.

Opening the back door I expected to see a destroyed shed and a smoking car. But what I saw was so much worse, with the flicking lights of the shed and lights from the main building you could see a clear sign of impact. It was midway up the shed with a clear sheen of a crimson red liquid. It was blood, it had to be blood. Hearing a sort of dragging sound I saw what seemed to be a pair of deer hooves being dragged into the gated trash area. As the feet vanished from sight it was met with another sound I will never forget. The best way to describe it is a few leaves of ice cold lettuce or cabbage that was slowly being twisted and bent causing the very distinct snapping sounds but somehow kept the sound of a juiciness to it. I was frozen in fear with everything that just happened. I thought maybe it was hit by a vehicle but it was too far away from the road to be flung that far. But then the conversation about the bear came into my mind and I began to back up. That's when the second sound hit my ears, it was very distinct like a cartoonish sound of a balloon full of slime that popped or the sound you expect from stepping into a bucket of semi melted butter. With that i quickly ran inside and locked the door my breathing heavy and labored.

Swiftly I made my way upfront and picked up the store's phone and called the police. I told them the bear was outside and that it was here the one people were talking about. And that it killed a deer in the trash area. They told me they were going to send people out and remain inside, maybe lock the door. They said with the snow coming in it's hard to get people out to my area at the moment. I groaned in frustration and made my way upfront after hanging up and turned off the auto function of the doors and locked them. Then I had an idea, I headed back to the counter and using a piece of paper I made a sign telling people to knock if they want in and that a bear is nearby.

Satisfied with my current choice I made my way to the drink station and poured hot water into a cup and then made my way down the aisles. I grabbed a package of hot chocolate and mixed it with the water before returning to the backroom to watch the cameras for this bear. I took a short cautious sip of the hot reassuring drink and placed it down while sitting at the computer. I shake the mouse to wake it up and it's the home screen. I double-clicked on the camera app, seems it closes on its own kind of weird. As the screens came into view I began to scan them and I found the one pointed towards the trash. There was no sign of the deer, or the bear and it seemed the blood on the shed was slowly being whisked away by the snow. I began to scan every other one top to bottom to see any hint of the screen thinking that maybe the bear got the creepy deer from earlier. Returning back to the original one I noticed something different, something moving. It was coming from behind the wall. It looked like branches of a tree slowly growing out and wrapping around the corner. As I bent in to somehow get a better look the sound of a knock jolted me causing me to knock over my drink. I placed napkins on the spilled liquid in a hurry and stood up the cup heading back out.

Standing at the door was an older Asian man I've never seen before but I suspected it was Sam. What gave it away was the surprisingly sized gun in his hand. Heading over, I unlocked the door and told him that the bear was outback by the trash. He nodded looking around and he told me to lock the door again. He was going to look around and see if he could find the beast. I told him about the dent in the shed and I thanked him. Watching him disappear behind the store I locked the door again. I stood there expecting the sound of a gun or shouting something. My heart quickened its pace as I waited. The wait wasn't too long because I heard something. It was the sound of an engine. Maybe a lawn mower? But what it was, was Sam on his snowmobile leaving the parking lot and down the road. Guess there was no bear and I was safe, hopefully.

I returned to the register, sat down in the chair and tried to gather my thoughts. What really helped me was the music playing from the speakers of the store. It's funny, they always play the same songs and sometimes I feel like I can tell you what time it is by the song playing. I guess I was so used to them that I never hear the songs unless I focus. And with that I began to laugh a small chuckle at first then full on laughter. I felt stupid i felt that I was overthinking everything. This isn't some cheesy movie or some over hyped TV show. This was reality everything has and had a logical explanation so far so i just needed to breathe. After the small mental break I let out a sigh of relaxation finally feeling better.

I looked down and saw my phone and picking it up I went onto social media to see how the party was going. Scrolling through there were pictures and videos of my friends seeming to have a great time. There was even a video of Rod fixing a drunk girl's car as she tried to hit on him. I smiled a bit watching it before continuing to scroll. I went through a few videos before my thumb stopped its doom scroll. It was a simple video of some girls at the party drinking and making sounds with no actual words. But that wasn't what stopped me, in the background of the video i spotted a deer by the tree line. And I could have sworn it was the same deer I was seeing outside and the one the bear had gotten. I know, how could I know what a deer looks like, especially from that far away. But it was a gut feeling along with the deer’s face. It looked stretched like someone was pulling on it, and the eyes seemed soulless and deep, very unsettling. I placed my phone down and placed my hands on my face when I noticed the post was only five minutes old.

With that I got up looking back at the clock. It's only been two hours since I've been here. So I needed something to eat. Maybe that would calm me down. Walking to the back to the premade food section I picked up a Turkey and Provolone sandwich. The great thing is that they were made from a deli in town and guessing by the expiration date we got them today. I smiled at it and grabbed a water heading for the register. I placed my items down and paid for them, even the hot chocolate packet I kept in my pocket. Sitting down in the chair I opened up the sandwich dressing it, then lifted it up to my mouth. I gave it a generous bite, as my mouth closed down on it I was met with a familiar but now unwelcoming sound of lettuce crunching. It threw me back to the scene outside, my stomach twisted and I ended up kneeling on the floor emptying out my stomach into the trash can. I tossed the sandwich into the trash and sat there catching my breath that the sound stole from me.

Sitting on the floor for a moment I heard a sound. It was a sound that raised my senses, it was the sound of something dropping on the floor in the store. I didn't hear anyone come in no wind or anything how could they with the doors locked. Slowly standing up I spotted a can slowly spinning in the middle of an isle. Looking past it I thought I saw something slink off to the side. And quickly stepping to the side to catch it there was nothing there. I shook my head gathering my nerves because there was nothing in here there was no way for anyone to be in here. So I walked out to the center of the isle where the now still can of dog food lay. I bent down and looked at it out of confusion and placed it back on top of the other watching it slide into place.

I figured maybe one of the few that came in moved it or something. Before standing up I looked forward towards the fridge doors and I froze every hair on my body standing at attention. In the reflection I could see something in the aisle next to me. It was massive, its body was the height of the shelves but it was crouched. And its eyes were ghostly white but I could feel they were searching for me. Then I could hear its breathing. It was heavy but held back like it was trying to hide it was there. It started to come towards the end of the aisle. Each movement causes the sound of a comb being lightly plucked. Tik Tik Tik is what I hear with every movement.

I started moving backwards slowly watching the reflection. It seemed the closer it got to the end the more blurry it got, not allowing me to get an actual good look at it. I don't know if it could see me in the reflection or if it could see me. But I had the sense that I was being watched again but from behind me. Were there two of them? How could something this big be so quiet and so stealthy. As I continued to back up I made the mistake of not watching where I was going and bumped into a section of chips. With the sudden noise I heard the breathing getting louder and closer and I knew it heard me and it was on its way. So I ran towards the counter, I could hear behind me the sound of it bashing into shelves as it ran. As I came close to the end of the aisle the shelf at the end came crashing down in front of me and with a scream I turned around and ran the opposite direction. I could feel it behind me, the sense of its eyes were burning into the back of my skull. I swear I could feel its breath nipping at my neck.

Turning at the end of the isle my shoulder caught the rack and sliced my arm open. I made it a bit down the first section before I stopped. I could feel the warm sensation of my blood leaking from my arm. And from behind me was the sound of licking, it was the kind of noise an annoying younger sibling would make to annoy you with the greedy licking and slurping of an ice cream you wanted but they got. Each sloppy lick was met with the sound of the plucking of a comb. I wanted to turn around to see with my own eyes what was chasing me now that it was busy with a taste of me. But every part of my body told me not to turn around, not to look. The lights above my head began to flicker and go out. With it came the silence. There was no more licking and I felt the spine tingling feeling of the eyes behind me so I bolted. I didn't make it far before my feet were swept from under me causing me to tumble to the ground. I felt the sensation of blood leaving my body again now from my ankle. I tried getting up, tried getting away but I was swatted again, this time into the shelves.

Pain shot up through my body as I now lay in the next aisle, my spine feeling as if I fell from a rooftop, and my side feeling as if I got punched by a professional boxer. I knew it was almost on top of me. I could smell it now. It was as if the sewers of a city were condensed into a small spray bottle and a child got a hold of it spraying it all over your face. I tried to move as fast as I could to the end of the aisle but I was met with the weight of a shelf crashing down on top of me. And to my horror I felt its weight being applied on top of it. The plucking of the comb ever so loud now, I could sense its face next to mine. I knew I should have gone to the party, that I should have been selfish. I'm sure whatever Wayne is dealing with is not worth my life. But here I was because I wanted this boy to like me. Now I'm going to die alone in the dark by the means of this monster. I finally felt its breath on my neck and that's when I heard it. The sound of snapping lettuce, my only thought was that it was its jaw slowly opening to consume me. I couldn't look at it, I didnt wanna open my eyes, I didnt wanna see it coming.

But as soon as everything started it stopped, I was met with a blinding white light. I expected to be dead, that I made it to heaven. Then I heard knocking. It was quiet in the distance at first. It slowly grew in volume until it was loud and banging in my head as well. Slowly opening my eyes and looking towards the source I spotted Wayne and a police officer at the main door. Wayne Finally got the door open and when they opened the door I heard the officer calling for an ambulance. Reaching me, Wayne lifted off the shelf from my body. While the officer tried to clear more around me. Realizing the beast could still be around I tried to quickly get up and warn them but my body winced and didn't want to move. I looked over to the officer and told him it was still in here.

The Officer quickly pulled out his gun and began to search the area. Wayne had gently lifted my head up onto his lap while we waited, my arm still bleeding, I heard the officer come back saying there was no sign of anything. He traded places with Wayne upon request and heading towards the back office the power was soon restored. He came back saying the first tank was empty. With the lights coming on I was blinded again I wasn't sure how long I was out for. By the time the ambulance arrived, my arm and ankle was being wrapped up as I tried telling both of them everything that had happened, both looking at me unsure of my story. I groaned out of frustration watching the cop leave to get the paramedics. Then I remembered something I shot up with a wince and shouted “The Cameras!”. And I made my way to the backroom Wayne trying to stop me. But this was my chance to prove this wasn't just some bear. I quickly sat down and shook the mouse to wake up the computer. But nothing happened, I remember the power went out so I reached down to turn on the switch and pressed it. But I was met with the feeling of wetness and no power. Looking down in confusion the hot chocolate wasn't fully stopped by the napkins and had leaked into the computer frying it.

I sat there defeated, shortly after the paramedics showed up with a stretcher guided by Wayne. As they wheeled me out I told them to wait and waved over the cop.

Kaitlyn: “Hey did you check for the deer by the trash?” I said with some kind of hope in my voice.

Officer: “Yeah I looked and there is a deer back there alright, in very bad shape. I'm guessing it got hit by a commercial truck in a hurry trying to get ahead of the snowfall. It seems it did not suffer long because the heart seems to have exploded. Least that's what I can guess from the mess.”

Laying back in the stretcher devoid of any more will, I waited for the Paramedics to load me up into the ambulance. That's when I noticed a trail of tracks leading from the store to the tree line. And it seemed every print was of a different animal and that's when I saw the backend of a deer vanish into the treeline.

I was treated at the hospital and the whole situation was written off as a bear attack. A few people have gone missing from the party and they still haven't found any traces of them. Wayne did make it up to me, He showed up almost everyday I was in the hospital with some kind of homemade dish. They weren't that good but he tried, and said he was sorry every time. He told me the situation was his drunken father causing issues at home. And he went home to protect his mother and sisters. He said his father is in rehab and doing better.

But now I'm sitting here in my room at my computer typing this all out for all of you so that my story can get out there. So that others can be warned that there is something out there, something watching. But as I'm almost finished writing this the sound of a comb being plucked has started in my closet and it's been getting louder. With the same uneasy feeling I'm being Watched.",1,1765257376.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1phz5id,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phz5id,Homemade paste secche (Sicilian Almond Cookies),"Hello all,

A fine recipe for Christmas cookies which doesn’t take hours! It also happens to be gluten free. A cookie which has a crunchy surface and a soft, chewy interior. Can’t beat the taste of almonds and cherries! 

I learned this about recipe when I was doing my patisserie apprenticeship. While it wasn’t given to me, I managed to construct one which is the following:

400g almond meal
100g desiccated coconut (not traditional but adds texture) if you prefer not to use coconut add another 100g of almond meal
200ml egg whites 
170g icing / powdered sugar
1tsp almond extract
1tsp vanilla extract

Orange or lemon zest is optional and traditional. My bakery would add mixed peel to theirs about 50g? 

Glace cherries for garnish
Slivered or flaked almonds for garnish
Sprinkles if desired 

To make the chocolate ones, I add 50g of cocoa powder and about 5g of powdered instant coffee. You will need about another 10-20ml of egg whites as cocoa dries out the mixture. 

You will need for utensils;
A mixing bowl
Spatula x2 
Stand mixer if using, with paddle attachment
Piping bags
Star tip (I used a loyal #9)
Baking trays lined with baking paper 

1. Preheat oven to 190C or 375F. Weigh out all dry ingredients and place in a bowl. 
2. Combine ingredients together until they are all mixed through well. You can use a stand mixer but you can absolutely make this by hand without elaborate equipment.
3. Add egg whites slowly, you are looking for a cement-ish consistency. Add extracts, zest and peel if using. 
4. Place into piping bag with attached medium sized star tip (I used a Loyal Size 9). 
5. Pipe star shapes about 3-5mm apart from each other, these cookies don’t spread. Dust icing / powdered sugar lightly prior to baking for a caramelised snowy effect
5. Bake at 190C or 375F for 6 mins, turn trays and bake for another 6-7 mins or until golden on the divots of the star shapes.
6. Dust icing sugar once cookies are straight out of the oven. 
7. Eat and enjoy! These are stable for about 3 weeks in a cool, dry environment.

1phz5gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalOrlando/comments/1phz5gg/first_trip_to_epic_some_thoughts/,First Trip to Epic - Some Thoughts,"Just back from a trip to Universal and Disney over the Thanksgiving break. Thought I'd get down some thoughts just in case folks find them helpful on *their* first trips. 

First off, we were in town all week splitting between Disney (AK and EPCOT, our favs) and Universal (IoA/USO and Epic). We planned on Epic for Thursday thinking maybe the holiday itself would help out with crowds. Did it help? Not sure. 

I'll say overall - crowds were much more manageable than I feared. We had no express passes because honestly I'm maybe irrationally against the entire concept. After a few days we'd almost resigned to buying them anyway to save time but it turned out they were sold out (don't believe the blogs and videos that tell you that you can just buy them at the park - at least on this holiday weekend, they were capped). So it was the ""Standby Line"" for us all day. But wait!

We stayed at Stella Nova hotel, which is walking distance to Epic and, since it's a Universal hotel, you get 1 hour early entry. This is crucial! Will get to that. First a sidebar about Stella Nova - this hotel was a lifesaver honestly. We were on a tight budget and this place, around $190/night, was a total steal. Just enough set decorations to impress my kiddo and make him feel like we were in a transformative sort of outer space experience, decent food options (a full-service restaurant would be nice, but we're hardcore park goers so the only benefit would have been a nice 6am breakfast). Anyway, thumbs up on Stella Nova - don't believe the haters, this is a great homebase style hotel.

So anyway, we got to the security gates solidly at 8am, an hour before early entry. The experience was great. Daniel the internet famous staff lead hyped the crowd, got us on our best behavior, made sure we thanked the staff for working during a holiday (a massive sentiment that I thought about all day), and helped diffuse the tension in general.   
  
We got through security around 8:50am then headed toward the Ministry of Magic, though at each checkpoint we were reminded that the ride would not be open until 10am though we were welcome to start queueing up outside the ride. Didn't matter. Hordes of us kept marching toward it anyway (of course it was our top priority and given wait times we'd seen around 210 minutes and beyond regularly, it was key for our day not to get stuck in a full line). 

We continued into the line and they opened the full on queue, so we quickly found ourselves walking freely through the enormous interior of that ride. Just an insane experience tbh. By the time we got to the loading area, it was suddenly apparent that they were just letting people on, a full 45 minutes early. It was honestly a miracle. By the time of regular park opening (10am), we were already in line for Donkey Kong, the one other line we were sweating. That one wasn't so smooth (hopped into line at a posted 90 minutes, ended up taking 2 hours). Also, the Donkey Kong line is tremendously boring compared to every other ride - it's like a throwback to 80s designs of just making you stand in enormous snaking crowd and saying ""deal with it"". But either way, by noon we had already knocked out our two biggest fish. 

No idea how they normally handle that early open, if it was a holiday special or what, but we felt pretty lucky. Thanks to our time saved on just those two rides, we were able to hit every other ride in the park with time to spare on a relaxed lunch at the Café L'air De La Sirène, reserved dinner at the Blue Dragon, multiple werewolf rides, chilling out in the Burning Blade, relaxing by the spooky fiddle player, and lots of wandering spell-casting. A+ day tbh.

Beyond that, here are some thoughts: 

Stardust Racers absolutely RIPS and we rode it 4 times, never waiting more than 10 minutes. I'd be happier riding baller roller coasters (grew up near Cedar Point) and this ride is a total gem. Intense, fast, completely wild interplay between the two tracks. Just a kickass roller coaster. Take advantage of the low wait times while all the rubes continue to flock to the big-brand name rides. 

Similarly, the Frankenstein ride is amazing and was almost never over a 35-minute wait (why would you want to skip the wait anyway - the castle rules to stand around in). The ride mechanics on this one were truly bananas and did some things I wouldn't have even really thought possible. Second favorite ride at the park, though not exactly comparable to Stardust. One nitpick is that while the queue line is legit haunting and creepy, the ride itself leans a bit too much into cartoonish, silly Frankenstein of the ""Bride of Frankenstein"" era. Totally legit given the film pedigree, but it felt like a tone shift to me. Gimme this ride but like three or four notches scarier. Loved it as-is though. Also this ride's gift shop is stocked with the coolest t-shirts at Universal, to my taste.  
  
That said, I think I'm over the ""immersive"" video screen rides. It's cool once or twice, but maybe after a week of all this stuff - Avatar, Transformers, Simpsons, Kong, Spider-Man, Guardians, Gringot's, Forbidden Journey . . . it starts to feel pretty played out. Which is unfortunately how I came away from Ministry of Magic. Yes, it's by far the most seemingly advanced of them all, to the point that you often can't tell if you're looking at animatronics or video, but i found the whole ride to be kind of numbing by the end. Am I part of this at all? Am i just looking at some sort of elaborate shadowbox? The framing device in your seat - like you're looking through a large picture frame - narrows your field of vision, and I think makes the ride even less engrossing than it could be. Really cool ride, but I wish we could take a break on these video screen dealies (highly doubt that will happen though).   
  
The Werewolf ride was a great ""wait till the end of the night"" ride. When it drops to like 5-10 minutes, that's the sweet spot. Fun, silly, schlocky horror ride that I'm sure plays much better in the ""deep dark woods"" at night than when you're blasted with bright Florida sun. What else.   
  
The show in Harry Potter land was fantastic - we're not usually theme park show-goers but we had the time and just went for it. It was great. I will contend that the way they heard you from one staging area to the next is pretty anxiety producing, wiping out the lines and just making it a free-for-all from one room to the next. Not a fan. 

Liked that show slightly better than the Dragons one which everyone somehow raves about. I didn't get it. It was a solid show! But not one of my top 5 things in the park for sure. 

Go to the Burning Blade. Don't get the spiced beer - it's ungodly sweet (the bartended gave us a sample first because she could sense the reaction - it's built for folks who throw bags of sugar in their coffee), but otherwise it's a great little bar, if you've ever fantasized about chilling in a tavern whose attic is still on fire. We ate the charred potato that we'd been dreaming about since seeing it on a park video months ago and were pleasantly transported to some creepy, cruddy burning countryside of yore. We're simple folks, I guess.

Hiccup's Wing Gliders is a great little roller coaster - good speed, unmatched scenic views. Really feels like you're flying through the world. Unexpectedly loved that one. 

We waited until the very end of the night to try and catch Mario Kart with a moderate wait - think we ended up with 30 minutes. This ride was utterly pointless to me. If you don't have a kid who's obsessed with the idea of doing a ""real life"" mario kart, you'll be fine to skip this thing. Janky ""gaming"" dynamics, totally forgettable narrative thanks to being uselessly focused on turning left or right at the correct time even though it has no effect on what your cart does. I just don't know what they're thinking here other than ""Let's convince kids to buy these goofy ass bracelets to save their score.""

Did I start the argument?,"I live with a roommate who I’ve been having a lot of issues with lately. For context, I have a history of cancer and a chronic liver disease, so getting sick is a big deal for me.

She caught the flu recently and spent days coughing and sneezing all over me. I tried to be understanding and even cooked for her, cleaned up, helped her with stuff, all of that. I also told her I needed to quarantine myself for my own health. I didn’t even ask her to isolate. I just said I would. She got offended.

Tonight she finally felt better and asked if I wanted to go to a coffee shop with her. My car is having issues until tomorrow, so she offered to drive. One of my friends who is visiting from overseas was going to meet us there.

Everything was fine until we were leaving. She suddenly made this pouty face and asked if I wanted to drive her car home. I was starting to feel flu symptoms and really didn’t want to drive, but I said “I can if you want.” She got quiet and clearly irritated.

We were on our way to the grocery store to get hot cocoa and then watch a movie at home. My friend was driving behind us to meet us there. The whole drive she stayed silent and looked angry. I finally asked if she was upset that I didn’t drive. She blew up and said she wants to feel loved the way she gives love, and that I should have said yes. Then she said I was starting drama just by asking. I told her she had been irritated with me lately and it was making me uncomfortable. She went straight into “I guess I’m just a terrible person.”

My friend knocked on the car window at that moment. I said “Let’s go inside,” trying to smooth it over. She refused to get out of the car. My friend and I went in the store.

Inside, I realized she wasn’t coming in, so I told my friend that my roommate and I were fighting and that I wanted to talk to her alone. I apologized to him and said we’d hang out tomorrow. He left.

I took one very quick lap around the store to clear my head, maybe two minutes. When I walked out to talk to her and apologize, her car was gone. Her location was turned off. No text.

It was dark and freezing. I had no car and I was starting to feel sick. Luckily my friend was able to answer his phone and came back to pick me up and take me home.

When I got home, I was worried she might have done something to herself, so I called her mom. Then my roommate turned her location back on and claimed she would never leave me stranded because she knew my friend was there. I told her he had already left because I asked him to. She accused me of manipulating her and said she knew I wasn’t going to be alone.

I told her I wasn’t going to argue. Now she isn’t coming home tonight and is still mad at me. I just returned to work today after four weeks on disability and tomorrow is only my second day back. She knows how stressed I’ve been, and she knows my health situation. Her disappearing like that scared me so badly.

She usually clings to me and calls me her best friend. She tends to blow up, apologize, smother me, then blow up again. This is the first time she’s just left and stayed gone. I have no family to go to and no backup support, and now I feel sick on top of everything. I’m exhausted and honestly really upset.

I gently purchased a Mahlkonig X64 along with a breville dual boiler.

I use the Pesado shower screen upgrade, pesado naked portafilter and a large pesado HE basket with a 1mm puck screen.

I set my filter to 0 being the first chirp of the grinds touching.

Ever since I’ve started using it (couple of weeks now) my grinds sit between 0.4-0.8 on a 10 point scale.  This seems very fine.

Also a 0.2 movement can sometimes be the difference between a 20 second and a 40 second shot.  I also have a bit of problems with consistency but assumed that’s probably puck prep.

I’m usually doing a 20g shot or thereabouts - I would have to say that sometimes I may have 1g differences in total coffee…

But all this aside - a range that tight seems weird.  Why have 0-10?

Any ideas would help!

  Quote from another roaster:This coffee is a snapshot of place, grown at the edge of Panama’s Mount Totumas Cloud Forest, where high elevation, rich biodiversity, and ecological stewardship converge. Originally cow pasture, the land was transformed by Jeffrey Diedrich and his brother into a reforested haven, with native nitrogen-fixing trees and wildlife enriching the soil naturally.Only six hectares are planted with coffee, including this rare Pache variety.

 The flavor note they give is:white flowers, floral, rose. Yes,that's quite how I feel,from high temp to low temp,it's mostly about flowers,white flowers,pink flowers.. with some light acid to balance ,forming an elegant cup.

 Notice:It might be hard to grind.I used c40 #22,but it feels like #15 or even lower.Hope you enjoy your cup!

(i will not promote)","**I’ve been tracking the divergence between the Chinese and Indian economic models, and I wanted to test a hypothesis with this community.**

***The Context (The Elusive Plan A):***

*For the last decade, the playbook was clear: Replicate China. We tried—at least on paper—to build massive factories, master efficiency, and become the low-cost supply chain for the world.*

*While we have made some progress (like mobile assembly), let’s be honest: We haven't replaced China as the ""World's Factory."" We still struggle with the sheer volume, logistics, and razor-thin margins required to win the global volume game.*

***The Observation (The Accidental Plan B):***

*However, while we wrestle with mass production, a different trend is emerging. Despite lower per capita income, Indian entrepreneurs (and consumers) seem to be pivoting towards Identity and Narrative rather than just price and volume.*

*While China became the ""backend"" (making things for others), India seems to be building a ""frontend"" (creating distinct brands).*

**The Evidence: The ""Value > Volume"" Shift**

The clearest signal is happening right now in our domestic consumption:

**1. Consumer Tech (The ""boAt vs. Marshall"" Paradox):**

We are seeing a saturation in the ""cheap & cheerful"" segment. Brands like boAt, which dominated by white-labeling affordable Chinese tech, are facing growth struggles in wearables.

Meanwhile, premium audio brands (like Marshall, Sony) are seeing a surge in demand in India. The Indian aspirational consumer is skipping the ""cheap utility"" phase and moving straight to ""brand identity."" They don't just want a speaker that works; they want one that says something about them.

**2. Automotive (Royal Enfield vs. The Commuter):**

China floods the world with efficient, plastic-heavy commuter bikes. They work perfectly, but they have no soul.

India exports Royal Enfield. It’s not the most technologically advanced, but it has a ""thump,"" a legacy, and a cult following. We are selling a feeling, not just transport.

**3. Lifestyle (Coffee & Tea):**

We used to just export raw beans/leaves to the West. Now, brands like **Blue Tokai** and Vahdam are branding the ""Indian Origin"" story. They are selling the estate, the farmer, and the craft to a global audience, effectively moving up the value chain.

**My Hypothesis:**

We often lament that India missed the manufacturing bus. But what if we are inadvertently building a ""**Boutique Economy**""?

* **China's Model:** Win by making 10 million units at $5 margin.
* **India's Model:** Win by making 1 million units at $50 margin.

The Question for the Sub:

Is this ""Boutique"" path sustainable for a country of 1.4 billion? Can high-value branding carry an economy, or is this just a nice layer of icing while the cake (mass manufacturing) is still missing?",0,1765256632.0,startups,9,0.38,False

1phyy8b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phyy8b,Cipher Gooseneck Kettle and V60 Switch = Really Good Coffee!,"This is a not a full review, but an early impressions post (*Scroll down for the TLDR*).

I really love how easy and faff-free making coffee with a V60 Switch and an Electric Gooseneck Kettle is! I am an espresso guy, through and through, but recently felt it was bit too much work early in the morning when I am just trying to shake off the webs. So switched to V60 Switch for the mornings. Tried a few times with a regular kettle, but the taste was *meh*\--mainly because there was no control--temperature or flow!

Finally decided to give in, and get an electric gooseneck kettle. After 3 months of scouting and being on the fence (because having already poured a significant amount in an electric grinder and number of accessories), finally decided to get the Cipher gooseneck kettle after seeing a few reddit posts praising it (shoutout to those redditors)!

The buying experience was quite smooth--and the customer support responded to all my queries patiently (I'm a bit of a OCD in terms of the materials used, especially for things that come in contact with food). I received the kettle within 3 days of placing the order. It was well-packaged, shipped through Blue Dart and everything was A-ok!   
  
I decided to try my V60 chops with a 3-month old Hunkal Aranya Gold, mainly because I had some left (waiting for the new grinder), and I did not want to lose fresh beans to my inexperience with pour-overs. I expected the coffee to taste slightly less than ok, at best, especially it being old and *value* beans--but man (or woman)!! It pleasantly surprised me. The brew had nice brightness, a hint of bitter-sweet aftertaste (the mouth-watering kind, not the drying kind)! This was with Coffee Chronicler's recipe for the Switch, and it turned out to be a really good cup, given the beans. Gonna try Switch recipes from Lance Hedrick, James Hoffman and Tales Coffee up next, with the fresh lot (Tetsu Kasuya's seems a bit too much work for me atm).

The Cipher Gooseneck kettle is working well (I haven't tested the temp accuracy, as I do not have an external thermometer), but the build quality seems good (will report back after sometime about how it holds up), excellent control for pours, and has a nice feature set. Two things that could be better, for their future iterations--slightly longer power cord, and a removable one at that would really good--these two things are not there in any gooseneck kettle available in India, I believe--but that's something that could really set them apart, especially as they are looking to make a mark on the coffee scene in India.

**TLDR:**

The combination of the Hario V60 Switch (bought from Brewing Gadgets India through Flipkart) and the Cipher Gooseneck Kettle is really good and produces really good coffee (even with 3-month old beans and a pour-over noob like me).

Other things, I believe, that made a difference to my coffee brewing:

DF54 Grinder (bought from Fix Coffee, earlier had a hand grinder)  
Timemore Precision Scale (bought from Brewing Gadgets India)

If you have any questions/suggestions/opinions--fire away!

The room is big and open, and I want my seating area to feel intentional rather than floating. Is my current layout working, or should anything be rotated, swapped, or pulled in/out to create better conversation flow?


Accessories + styling
I’m open to adding lighting, plants, a rug alternative (I have carpet so it’d need to be purposeful), small décor, etc. If you see any spots that need warmth, height, or texture, let me know!

We are also exploring the idea of a larger sectional sofa.

Thanks so much — I really appreciate any specific layout or styling ideas that work with what I already have!",1,1765256281.0,DesignMyRoom,3,1.0,False

1phyrik,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1phyrik/new_here_15_drinksday/,New here… 15 drinks/day,"This is long, but I hope it can resonate with someone. 

I’ve been a distant admirer for several months. The stories I keep reading are either miraculous or devastating which, I believe says a lot. 

I made it through college without having a drink then started my career in marketing for a professional sports league. Traveling, mixers and meeting up with buddies contributed to drinking 2-3 drinks a day, a few times a week. I worked my ass off, why not? Fast forward several years, numerous tragedies including losing my Mom at a young age, my Dad facing a prison sentence (yes, they were related), while trying to be the lynchpin to my family, keeping my head down to try to not become like my white-trash upbringing, I turned, almost instantaneously to booze. 

And it was easy. The culture of craft beers and whiskey glorified it to a point where you seemed like a weiner (yeah, a weiner) if you weren’t buying $100 bottles. Soon, it was 4-5 drinks a night - every night. Then 8-10. So on. So on. 

I learned booze made the headaches go away so I’d have a Bloody Mary at work (it has been acceptable everywhere I worked) then a few cocktails at lunch and continuing until 2 am around when I’d inevitably pass out. While being highly “functional”. Many nights my wife would wake me up at and beg me to come to bed. Sometimes I would. Others I’d pass back out and have no knowledge. 

Alcohol made me creative. It made me want to pick up the phone and talk to clients or prospective clients. I’d show up with whiskey on my breath and lift at the gym. I was getting promoted. My kids think I’m Superman an alcoholic can’t do those things right?

The realization slapped me in the face when the office assistant who made our booze runs had to go out two days in a row. “We’re hitting it hard this week huh?” I joked when she walked in. “Not we.” She said. Non-judgmental. Mental note, keep a couple shooters in my truck. STILL at this point, I was justifying everything. 

Covid hit and, as I’m sure many of you can relate to, the wheels came off. No more hiding it. In fact, virtual cocktails became a weekly thing. 

My wife told me she was concerned. “No problem, I’ll stop.” Smile reassuringly. Panic inside. 

Monday morning comes and my “coffee run” was going to the convenience store, buying something for an excuse and taking out $10 cash so I can hide it. Buy 4 vodka shooters (she can smell the whiskey), chase it with a Red Bull in the parking lot then ditch the evidence in the garbage can out front of the store. 

Around 11 am I’d go “workout”. Stop at a liquor store (different one, obviously) workout with 4 shots of vodka and electrolytes in my water bottle, ya know, for balance. Then later in the day finding any excuse I can to go the store, go get dessert, go anyfuckingwhere I can because I’d start PANICKING that I might have to go to bed without one more drink. 

A few weeks ago, someone backed into my truck driver side door just as I was about to crack open what was probably my 9th drink of the day. I sweet talked the old lady into not calling the cops because they would “definitely” write her a ticket but that our insurance will cover it and it’ll be ok. I went home and vowed to never drink again. 

The next day I had 22 drinks. I’ve quit before and when I thought I’d be fine having just a couple, I’d slowly descend back into quiet chaos. I called a friend who I knew was in a similar situation but is now over a year into his sobriety journey. I’m praying and hoping that this time is different. I’m six days sober and honestly, haven’t been itching like I have in times past. 

The funny thing is, it was something so little and stupid my friend said that just made a lightbulb go off. “You’re proud when you do hard shit. This is just different hard shit.” It gave me such determination to have something I’ll be ridiculously proud of. I don’t know what my goal is. Maybe forever, I could see that, but I want it to be today and tomorrow and for a long time after, but I’m telling myself I’m not capable of handling 3, and that doesn’t make me weak.

I met S(f23) about two years ago in a rooming accomodation thing. We hit it off pretty well and became friends. After about a year of knowing each other we decided to move out into our own place cause the other roommates were annoying and we got along so well together.

After we moved in together our relationship went from friends to kind of like dating but without any titles (which is something I'm not fond of but it's whatever). Admittedly I was obsessed with her, I spent a long time before meeting her alone so having someone who would talk to me and joke was great. 

But it's been almost a year and the obsession I feel like has worn off and now I just see it how it is? She likes me but I think in the way you like a pet or a sibling. She likes the companionship and company but I don't think she cares about me as a person.

If I talk about my interests I'm given a few nods and ""Yuh uhs"" before she cuts me off and talks about her own stuff or she just ignores me. I am a bit of a rambler sometimes but even if it's just a quick few words it's still dismissed.

We originally planned on splitting things in half. She cooks, I clean. I do the dishes for dinner and vacuum the common areas. But it's turned into I clean 'every' dish, not just dinner, but her breakfast, lunch, coffees and snack dishes. If I don't do them they will literally just sit there forever or if she does do them she sucks at washing them.

I manage all the bills and rent aswell, I don't know how we slipped into it but I pay extra rent for the bills and she doesn't, she just buys the food shopping. Which is ever changing in the amount depending on what we're eating so it's hard to tell if I'm taking advantage or she is.

I want to move out back into something by myself, I feel like I'm not relationship material. My mental state is declining and I don't want to hurt her feelings by one day snapping and saying things I'll regret but I'm also seeing signs in myself of severe depression, like I'm regressing into the worst I've been.

I don't know what to expect from this post, maybe just to vent. 

This is technically my first 'relationship' so I have no idea if faking being happy 75% of the time is normal.

1phymsp,http://casinokart.com,🧰 How to Maintain Your Poker Table Felt -Step by Step!,"# Daily / After-Each-Game: Light Cleaning

* Use a **soft-bristle brush** or **lint-free cloth / microfiber cloth** to gently sweep away dust, crumbs, chalk residue — especially before they embed into the fabric.  
* Always brush in a **single direction** (not circular or back-and-forth) to protect the felt fibers and maintain a smooth nap.  

# Weekly: Deeper Dust & Debris Removal

* Use a **vacuum with a soft brush attachment** (on low suction) to lift deeper dust or chalk buildup. Be gentle — avoid aggressive suction or rotating brushes that might pull or stretch the felt.  
* Check for crumbs or food debris especially around edges and rails — these spots often get overlooked but can accumulate dirt over time.  

# Handling Spills & Stains (Accidents Happen)

* **Blot, don’t rub.** If there’s a spill — coffee, drinks, snacks — immediately blot with a clean, absorbent cloth or towel. Rubbing can push liquid deeper into the felt fibers, making stains set and damaging the cloth.  
* For water-based stains, you can dampen a cloth lightly with a **mild detergent + water solution**, gently dab the area, then rinse with another damp cloth, and **air-dry thoroughly**.[ ](https://www.justpokertables.com/blogs/news/poker-table-maintenance-made-easy-tips-for-long-term-care?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Avoid harsh chemicals, bleach, or abrasive cleaners — they can degrade felt color and fibers.  

# Monthly / Periodic Maintenance

* Do a **full surface check** for wear, fraying, loose threads, or color fading. Early detection can help avoid bigger problems.  
* If your room is humid or prone to temperature fluctuations, ensure there’s **good ventilation**. Excess humidity or moisture can warp wood parts or cause felt to stretch / mildew.  

# When Table Is Not In Use: Protect & Store Smartly

* Use a **fitted table cover** or cloth when not in use. This helps protect felt from dust, sunlight (fading), accidental spills, and general wear.[ ](https://www.casinosupply.com/blogs/news/how-to-clean-and-maintain-your-gaming-table-felt?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Keep food or drinks away from the table — use separate snack/drink area with coasters or trays to avoid condensation or spills near felt.  

**🔧 Recommended Gear from CasinoKart to Help Maintain or Restore Your Table**

If you’re investing in a poker setup, or already own one — these products from CasinoKart can help you care for the felt properly or prepare for maintenance/re-felt when needed:

* **8-Feet Suited Speed Cloth Roll** — useful if you want to re-cover your table cloth when old felt gets worn out; good-quality cloth ensures smooth card glide and long-lasting surface.  
* **Compact Poker Mats (4×4′ / 8×4′ — e.g. Gripper Series / Astra Series)** — smaller mats are easier to maintain and can double as tabletop protectors; great for casual games or when storing table between uses.  
* **Full-Size Poker Tables (e.g. Strada Series, Octagonal / Foldable Tables)** — tables built with quality wood and finishes often resist warping or damage better, making felt care more effective and durable.  
* **Luxury or Premium Tables (with good finish/rails/wood treatment)** — better-quality wood & build helps in maintaining felt shape and overall table longevity, especially in humid or heavy-use environments.  

**🧠 My Recommendations: Do These to Keep Your Felt “Casino-Ready”**

* Treat felt with **gentle care — daily brushing + weekly vacuuming**. A little bit often beats infrequent heavy cleaning.  
* **Spills happen — blot fast, clean gently, dry thoroughly.** Acting quickly helps avoid stains or permanent damage.  
* Use a **table cover** and **avoid food/drinks directly on the table** — small preventive habits make a big difference for long-term upkeep.  
* When changing cloth or doing maintenance — **go for quality felt / speed cloth** (like CasinoKart’s) rather than cheap alternatives. It preserves play quality and makes upkeep easier.

1phyl11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1phyl11/is_my_recently_diagnosed_bpd_girlfriend/,Is my recently diagnosed BPD girlfriend manipulating me?,"Warning: mentions of ED self harm and suicidal ideations (not graphic just mentioned)

This is a long story and I honestly just need relationship advice.

I (18F) started officially dating my gf (18F) 2 or so months ago. we both started university and had been chatting online for months before meeting in person. This is my first time ever being in a full on relationship. I’ve had situationships and stupid highschool crush stuff but never something like this. For her it’s the complete opposite. She has dated plenty of people, gone further sexually with others ect ect. I don’t judge her for this but I know I’m far behind on experience and don’t know what’s normal.

For context before I go into the deep stuff. During the summer mid talking stage she got really drunk and texted that she could see herself marrying me and having kids with me. I guess I was not on the same page and I kinda freaked out because it felt like she barely knew anything about me and had already envisioned a future for us together. I felt romanticized not liked I guess. I told her I felt like we were on different pages and unintentionally “ended” what we had started.

 Literally not even two days later she’s bought flowers and is about to go date another girl. They dated for a month but broke up as uni was coming and apparently I was still on her mind. 

As we met in person in September things felt normal. I like her a being with her a lot and feel more comfortable opening up now that we’re in person.

She’s suffered with depression and anxiety and I know this. She had to go to a mental hospital for attempting suicide about two years ago. Recently she opened up to me about the relapse of these feelings. Calling me late at night telling me she had self harmed, telling me she’s losing will to live. And about a week ago she got really close to attempting suicide, not full on but got the pills and everything  and has been alluding to it every day since. It’s finals season and I need to keep up with my studies while being there for her and I’m sobbing and crashing out daily because nothing I say helps. She just hates on herself she  reposts on TikTok about how she wants to. She literally reposts videos about suicide J notes Ect ect.

Since I care about her I try my best to support her but I’m not a therapist, I don’t know the perfect things to say other than listening. She barely eats anymore and I try and tell her having only a coffee is not okay but she just brushes it off. She told me she’s very against drugs but texted me last night drunk saying she’s smoked again. 

I myself have struggled (and honestly still do) with anorexia and all this is causing me to feel like relapsing. When she doesn’t eat it makes me feel like not eating. When she talks about self harm I feel guilty because I’m clean. I feel trapped.

Recently because of the attempt she reconnected with her psychologist which was great to hear. Yet, the psychologist says she most likely has BPD (heard via my gf). It all kinda started to reveal itself in my head, the I love you she said 1 week into dating me, the late calls, the on and off weeks, the suicidal ideations, the moving on quickly.

When she told me this she said that it would “make sense if I left” and kept saying “sorry. But she didn’t necessarily say it like that she 
1. Started by saying she didn’t want to lose me
2. Said she’s really fucked up and such a bad person (so I consoled her)
3. Said she’s would understand if I left her
4. Said I’m the only reason she’s getting better.

Is this not manipulation? I feel like I’m being driven insane. I don’t feel happy and I feel consistently guilted by her. She says “wyd” I sa “studying you?” She says “oh okay I won’t bother you then” THERES NOTHING I CAN DO I FEEL CRAZY SHE USED TO BE MORE REGULATED BUT NOW I FEEL LIKE INSANE. 

I’m scared I’m just becoming a sole resource or a tool to distract her from her illness or the only reason to motivate her.

I feel like we are preforming a relationship to make her feel comfortable and loved and it’s messing with me. 

I don’t know how relationships should go. I know you’re supposed to be there for ur partner but I don’t know how to. We share all the same friends now, I can’t do anything. I’m stressed and I can’t shake this anxiety. I cry all the time, I can’t focus on studying I’m tired and worn out emotionally. I’ve tried to communicate my fear of being idealized but she reassures me that’s not the case. I don’t know someone please help me

She’s basically alluding that she will kill herself if we break up but if we stay together I know I’ll go resentment because all of her emotions will be on me. There’s so much more to unpack so much more guilt tripping but I need to know how to communicate this without her hearing “you’re a burden and don’t matter kill yourself” 😞",1,1765255257.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1phygce,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxtechsupport/comments/1phygce/random_shutdowns_display_crashes/,Random Shutdowns & Display Crashes,"Hi everyone,

I’m experiencing serious stability issues on my system, and I’m hoping to get advice on debugging them. Here’s the full picture:

**Symptoms:**

* The display sometimes crashes during normal use, whether its gaming, idle browsing, or even before any display manager (LightDM, GDM3, etc.) even starts.
* Occasionally, the entire PC shuts down unexpectedly.
* The system fails to boot at all if it’s not plugged into AC power.
* The crash/black screen issues occur sometimes even before any display manager starts.

**Steps / Attempts Already Made:**

* Booted into [`multi-user.target`](http://multi-user.target) by adding [`systemd.unit=multi-user.target`](http://systemd.unit=multi-user.target) to GRUB and updating grub.
* Tried starting display managers manually:sudo systemctl start lightdm sudo systemctl start gdm3 
* Switched between multiple display managers (LightDM, GDM3).
* Rebooted multiple times with secure boot on and off.
* Tested running from a live USB — issue still occurs, indicating it might be hardware or low-level driver related.

The crashes and shutdowns appear before any graphical login, so it seems to be a system-level or hardware/driver issue, not a problem with LightDM or GDM.

I’ve tried both AC and battery power; unplugged power always fails to boot.

The issue reproduces even on a clean live USB, so maybe that suggests it is likely hardware-related or firmware/driver related?

I want to reliably boot into a usable system, with or without a display manager, and prevent these crashes and shutdowns. Any advice on debugging early display crashes, boot failures, or power issues would be greatly appreciated.

I can provide more info if needed.

I am an Asian (Vietnamese women, married, 37s), basically I can communicate in English pretty good, I know a lot places to visit in Hanoi (as a local) and also love to speak English with foreigners from any countries :)

The story is I always love lifestyle of Western women and just wonder how their society and family environment influence to that life-style. Today I just suddenly think I may host a group of maximum 3-4 ladies (over 30s is perfect)  and we can share small tips, chitchat on non-serious topics during the time you stay in Hanoi.

\-  Walking from 6 AM to a Pho Place

\- Have a morning Coffee/ Vietnam Tea ( I know a place)

\- Sharing some tips/ good daily routine or anything u wanna share during Vietnam Trip

\- Give away, exchange books/used clothes/ accessories or anything you wanna exchange (1-2 things). For example I own  used silk skirts and wanna change an English fiction book.

So if you are interested in my activities, just leave me inbox. Any ideas are welcomed.",4,1765254373.0,hanoi,3,1.0,False

With each main character introduced, they drag in more curiosity or dimension into the realm of Tokyo ghoul, such as gangs, mafia family, shadow police force, small quirks like ghoul wedding, drinking coffee.

And far from Earth in the realm of Exparta, while most of Hell sleeps, brothers Leviathan and Beelzebub discover a lurking threat beyond the borders of the realms.

Old powers are awakening, and each choice draws them closer to a reckoning that could protect life as we know it - or end it.
