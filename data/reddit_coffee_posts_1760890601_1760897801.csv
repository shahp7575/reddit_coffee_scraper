As someone who works remote with global teams, I find that maintaining a community has always been a challenge. So, here goes my blind shot - I’m hosting  a small group of remote workers, ideally in their 20’s and 30’s who would like to build meaningful connections. I’ll be hosting chill coffee meets, cafe/food runs, indoor and outdoor activities over winter and the coming months so that we have shared memories to bond over. :) 

If this is something you’d be interested in, please reply here or reach out via dm. We can get a WhatsApp group going as well in case you’d like to stay informed about upcoming meets of the community. 
Everyone is welcome as long as you’re respectful of others. :) ",1,1760897529.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,1,1.0,False

I find the trophy silhouette is just a blob with no notable details (like the Stanley cup but maybe I’m biased) and why is it over the 2 when the 2 doesn’t need a hole in it like the 6 does? Why insist on using the trophy silhouette when it’s so undefined? If it were blown up and detailed/coloured, it might work, but why not make a simplified option for small prints like this? I feel like there are so many better choices. My partner argues that football/soccer fans would read this logo super easily but I just find it hella ugly and dense.

1oawmy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1oawmy6/considering_dropping_out_of_being_the_maid_of/,Considering dropping out of being the maid of honor. Advice?,"I have this close friend I've had for almost a decade (perhaps actually a decade; neither of kept track, because we weren't close the first few years). She is a great friend, if we are just sitting at her house and catching up. She does not handle even minor stress well, so I just prefer to not even go anywhere when I visit. 

She has done a lot in the past for me, such as throwing a baby shower for me (she did spend $600 on, which I think is a ton), and she helped me out when I was freshly post partum and homeless. She let me stay with her for a month and didn't charge me anything. She does have a kind heart, but is extremely stressful to plan events for or to even go out in public with. She isn't a bad person, she just doesn't have great mental health, so anything with even minor stress is a struggle. I will explain.

I'm her closest friend, and at some point she was mine. But I do feel I have emotionally grown distant recently. I have much healthier coping habits then I did when we were close (we relate a lot due to both having bipolar disorder). I'm stable and doing so well. It took a lot of effort, but now it almost feels easy to maintain. I take my meds, see a doctor, and stay sober. I'm living a healthy life. 

She is against meds, which I've talked to her about (because tbh, she does not function well off of meds either), and doesn't want therapy. She has a lot of personal issues in her relationship and with parenting, but I'll keep this post focused on the wedding part. 

Her and her man have 1 toddler and she is currently pregnant, due November. However, they are going to get married in July 2026.

She's really the same person I've known for 10 years. She does not have a substance abuse issue at all, but she definitely has extreme irritability characteristic of bipolar. She is always blowing up and yelling about the smallest things when things go wrong, and it makes event planning for her very difficult. This is not a post partum or pregnancy issue, she has always been this way. I used to relate; I don't have anger issues, but my bipolar 'irritability' always manifested as anxiety, so we got really close airing similar grievences to each other. She has a lot of regret and remorse for how she handles things, but can't seem to control it when she's stressed 

She has a lot of great traits and is a loyal friend, but it's impossible to even have a nice time at the store with her. 

Example, she is currently pregnant (due in November). I paid for some of the gender reveal and all of her baby shower. She was really grateful, but made the whole thing extremely stressful on me. For the gender reveal, I took her to 4 stores day of to pick up things. I asked multiple times if she wanted to go the days beforehand, but she kept flaking. So we ended up doing everything day of. I was asked to be there at 8am, which I was. It then took her 2 hours to get ready and finally get in my car. The gender reveal was planned for 1pm. 

So yeah, she was extremely stressed that we were probably going to be late, that perhaps we didn't have enough time, and she was kind of right. Everything was really tight and we ended up decorating with guests there (she was extremely emotional and stressed the whole time too). She was crying and putting things up, super upset (mind you, I insisted so many times I could pick up everything prior, but she wanted to go). I paid for the decor (between a party store and also dollar tree) she selected, but I couldn't afford more at the time, so she was in charge of paying for the food (for the guests). When we got to the checkout at Costco, her card was not working. She was freaking TF out. Tears, occasionally hitting the self checkout machine (I was actively stressed that I was going to get banned, because it's my membership). Everyone was looking, and I'm kind of shy, so it was really stressful.

I did have enough money on me to pay for the groceries, but it was money I was saving to buy my own toddler clothes (she had just sized up). The issue is my friend is one of those people you have to hound to get paid back, otherwise she just doesn't. So I didn't trust to pay for it, because I didn't know if I could get it back. And it wasn't money for me.

Anyways, eventually I just convinced her to use a different card. Turns out the one that wasn't working was locked by her and she forgot (which I believe, because she loses the ability to think logically with how worked up she gets), but we didn't know that until the next day. That's not the big deal, it's the fact that every single time we go to the store, it's more of the same. 

There was also an instance, where she handed a toy to the cash register guy at dollar tree, that she didn't want her kid to have, but she never said that. She handed it to him while he was checking out our stuff, so he assumed it also needed to be rung up. She got snappy and angry at him. I was pretty embarrassed. The other stores didn't involve any scenes, but she was angry and stressed the whole time. Not at me, just in general. She's never blown up at me, but I hate being around her when she's angry, because you can feel her seething and it stresses me out.

She gets overtly stressed and lashes out at people she doesn't know though.

For the baby shower, I tried to completey avoid this issue by buying most of the things myself. I paid for all of it, which isn't the issue; I was completely ok with that. The big issue is that she used to make a ton of money (I'm talking 150k plus, but it really depended on the year) via only fans; she is extremely beautiful, maybe one of the prettiest women I have ever seen in person, so it's zero surprise. Her BF was not ok with that work, so she stopped doing it. Now she's a stay at home mom to their current toddler, and is also pregnant. Still very beautiful, just doesn't do that work anymore, and so she doesn't have that income. 

Her man does make 45/hr, but they do live pretty expensively, so they don't have a lot of spending money leftover at the end of the day. They also don't have 2 incomes anymore. I get by pretty well with $23/hr, and I'm a single mom. Point being, there's been a huge issue with her not being used to having less money. I won't go into examples from her personal life, but it was apparent with the baby shower. 

She was sending me beautiful decor from different places that was very expensive. I'm talking $100 for paper plates/cups for 30 people. All of it was pretty expensive. I was honest and said I just didn't have that money. 

She was visibly upset, not angry (more like sad/disappointed), so I asked if there was anyone else who could help pitch in, or if she wanted someone else to throw it, and she told me there is no one. I honestly had a brainless moment, because I know she doesn't have any other good friends rn. She lost a lot of them the last few years, some due to issues of her own, others because they were party friends and had no intention of being anything other than that (so they left when she started having kids). 

Her mom also moved cross country and doesn't have money. Her sisters aren't helpful. But I literally didn't remember in the 10 seconds I asked that (I had a lot going on at the time). Long story short, I ended up hosting it. I still spend like $250 on decor, $50 on the cake, and $200 on food. So not the most, but still a good amount of money. 

She later cried to me about how upset she is that none of her other friends or family cared to make her 2nd baby shower special for her, and basically said it wasn't what she wanted. It didn't offend me, but it did make me feel like I just shouldn't have, because it still upset her. During the baby shower, she also just seemed solemn and unhappy, so it was again stressful. Her first baby shower, she still had a huge savings, so she paid for it all, and we just put up the decor for her. She was still extremely stressed, but seemed more happy with the end result. Easily a 2k baby shower, but she doesn't have money like that anymore.

I honestly had a horrible time planning both. I usually love to do this for loved ones (I've planned 3 baby showers and 1 small wedding), and I do a pretty good job at listening and adjusting things for people. Everyone else I've had this experience with was so happy and relieved of stress, which was wonderful for both parties. I did spend more on the other events, because they happened when I was childless and younger.

Tbh though, everyone else had much better support systems, so I was able to do more also due to that, and also with more help. 

My friend is already talking about her bridal shower and her wedding, and she wants me to be in charge of both. 

3 things are making me want to say no. 

1) that is so many events, in such quick succession. It makes it a lot of stress (I think I'd even find it stressful if she handled stress better), because planning things can be tiring. The other events I said I planned for people have happened over a 10 year, spaced out period. If someone had a wedding happen right after a baby shower I hosted, or the other way around, they didn't ask me to plan both. It's also, of course, financially stressful

2) I feel her expectations are more than I can meet sometimes. Even with me giving my best, I don't know that it'll end up with her happy. She is already wanting to do a trip to California (we are from Utah) for her bridal shower. She is talking about wine tasting (she loves wine). I am sober, but that's not the issue at all (I love coffee for example and can chug on that all day just fine), it's the fact that I just know that's at least $2,000-$3,000 in flights, hotel, and food costs, even if I'm paying just for her and me, and having her other friends pay for themselves. We watch the 3 weddings show together sometimes, and so from commentary she makes, I know she's thinking of me contributing financially to that as well. She is wanting me to contribute ""just"" $1,000. I would be willing to spend $1,000 total between the wedding and the bridal shower, but that's something I know won't go over well. 

Specifically, because she knows I have $6,000 saved, that I just inherited a month ago.  She had a falling out with a friend because she asked them to borrow $50 and they said no, and she knew they had $2,000 saved. I don't really talk about that money or consider it, because I'm saving it for emergencies or my child's needs, but I have a big feeling she is expecting me to use that. I'm not going to, because half of it is for emergencies, and the other half is going to be a college fund for my child.

3) Even with the financial part removed, let's say she takes a talk about how I can't spend that much money on those events well, I just think it would be so stressful to go through planning 2 huge events for her. Only because she gets too reactive to anything going wrong or different. And I know those events are things that will take time to plan. So I'd have to deal with months of stress.

To wrap things up, idk. I feel bad because she has done a lot for me. But I'm thinking of dropping out of one or both events, which tbh I have no idea how those conversations will go.

I'm posting this for feedback, because tbh I can't put myself in her shoes. Even when I was engaged (with the father of my child), I was just going to elope and go on an affordable (to me) honeymoon. I've never been into weddings. I also didn't want a baby shower, but did end up enjoying mine. I would've been fine without though. I love planning birthday parties and holidays for my daughter, so I'm not against events in general. I think maybe I'm just not as traditional, but I do respect her right to be. I just don't know if Im making the right choice, when I know she will have to completey cancel or alter plans if I don't plan these for her. Thoughts?",1,1760897428.0,wedding,0,1.0,False

Yeah.” And gave it to me and said he’d follow me when he got home that night which was understandable bc it’s food service and they also were about to close. I waited that night and nothing.

I also should note I think he’s like 3 years younger than me which doesn’t bother me for once bc he’s HOT but I’m just like wtf does he not like me? And if not why did he look in my eyes like that omg. He’s a cute nerdy guy so I don’t think he’s a huge flirt it kinda took a while for us to even flirt but idk.

Ever since Covid I’ve Doordashed pretty consistently without thought. It was super convenient and thought it was a great deal especially with dash pass. As of recent I’ve been ordering it twice A DAY and doing orders for my next meal for example four double cheeseburgers for lunch and dinner instead of ordering twice. 

Financially it hurts but not enough where I couldn’t, but for my health it’s been very problematic I didn’t realize it but in a span of two years I’ve gained 40 pounds from 170 to 210. On paper it doesn’t sound like a lot, but on me it started to get noticeable since I’m not that tall. 

Recently I’ve started to care more, if I ever want something unhealthy and within my area I promised myself to walk there and it has saved me so much money and lost me tons of weight. I’m down 20 pounds in 2 months. My favorite coffee shop is about 3 miles away and I get it every 3 weeks walking!!! 

I tried gym, exercise, etc. but the thing that worked for me was walking to the places I want to eat or even places I just want to go. It makes me feel full without eating nearly as much. 

Thanks for reading I know this doesn’t apply to everyone because some places obviously aren’t walkable, but you get the idea. If you’re lazy love eating and don’t like working out this helped me a ton.

As usual, we had a new people join us for the first time. About 11 or 12 odd people came to such a meet-up for the first time.

Age: 37

Occupation: Student, I am attempting a career change, so my family currently gets by on my husband, Iain’s university lecturer salary

Hometown: Originally from the Midwest, I now live in Glasgow

**Section Two: Assets + Debt**:

Retirement Balance: I have about $160k in a mix of retirement accounts and general brokerage from before I moved abroad. Iain is part of a defined benefit pension scheme with his union, so there’s not a balance exactly.

Equity: We have roughly £56,000 in equity in our 3-bedroom flat, which we purchased 5 years ago for £147k (we got a phenomenal deal. Sellers were keen to move to the countryside during lockdown) with a £38k down payment. 

Savings account balance: £8000

Checking account balance: about £2000 at the start of our trip. Obviously, this fluctuates quite a bit throughout the month and also month to month.

Credit card debt: £0

Student loan debt: I have zero, my husband has some from his MPhys, I think he pays about £100/month towards it, but I don’t have a pay stub handy to check. If he makes less than the threshold amount of £32,745/year, payments stop, and if the loan is not fully paid in 30 years it’s written off. Honestly, it’s not something either of us worry about. The Scottish government funds tuition for degrees, so his loan amount is for loans taken out to help him with living costs while he studied, his family couldn't help.

**Section Three: Income**

Main Job Monthly Take Home: Iain: £ 2,843.43

Me: £0

Any Other Monthly Income Here:  Me: I receive about $1600 monthly from a trust I received from a relative. My husband insists that it is ""my"" money and I shouldn't use it for our household expenses. The majority of the money goes into an UGMA account for our son, but I have roughly $15k in a HYSA in the US for emergencies. 

**Section Four: Travel Expenses**

**Transportation**:  About £70 of diesel for our paid-off Hyundai. We looked at taking the train, but it would have been £503 for the three of us, plus a taxi from the station to the resort.  We also paid £10.50 to take the M6 toll road and avoid Birmingham at rush hour,

**Accommodations**: £380 for two nights in the Legoland Woodland Village, which included two breakfasts for each of us and 1 day tickets to the park. We also purchased second-day tickets to the park for each of us for £45/ total.

**Pre-Vacation Spending**: for this trip our only pre-vacation spend was filling up the car, £67 

Day one: 

We purchased £15.04 worth of car snacks at Lidl before leaving Glasgow around lunchtime. This included a case of fizzy water and two ploughman’s sandwiches, a ham sandwich, some chips, and some apples. While we drive, we play games and tell each other spooky stories. Traffic wasn’t too bad, so it was fun for a while. Driving through the Scottish borders and northern England is picturesque, particularly on a cloudy day like we had, when the sunlight dapples the hills and gives you the impression you and the sheep are little bugs in the leaf litter of a forest so big you can’t comprehend the trees. 

It’s a 7-hour drive, so even in good company, you eventually get restless. We stop at Lancaster services (about 3 hours in) to use the bathrooms and refresh our morale with £1.49 in peanut cups for me, a latte at £4.45 for my husband (he says it was shite), and 2 for £4.00 on drinks for my son and I. He gets a sprite and I get a diet coke. We get the Switch out of the car boot and our son plays Animal Crossing for a while before falling asleep as we continue our drive south. Normally, we would limit both screen time and fizzy drinks, but regular rules don’t apply to road trips. My husband and I see who can cheat more at Stobarts (we both claim we have won and agree to settle it on the way back), and I force everyone to listen to my favorite Eurodance hits of the 90s. Ask not for whom the Vengabus comes, it comes for thee. 

We pay £10.50 to take the M6 toll, which gets us away from the Birmingham rush hour traffic, which we estimate saves us about an hour of frustrating drive time. Worth it. 

When we are about 90% of the way there, we remember we did not bring water for tea-making. Yes, there will be water in the room, but it will be the practically opaque, mineral-laden water of southern England, and it makes tea that you have to sourly grind between your molars. We stop at a shopping centre to buy 2 x 2 litres of water for 75p each, and a big pack of Yorkshire Gold teabags for £7.30. We won’t drink 160 cups of tea on the trip, but it is a better price per cup and we’ll just take it home with us. While we are stopped, our son sees a McDonald’s and asks for dinner, being too tired to think of any alternatives, we agree and spend £20.47 on dinner. Maybe it was my joy at being out of the car, but my veggie dippers happy meal was much better than expected. We continue to Windsor and arrive at Legoland at last!

We’ve been to Legoland before, but this time we are staying in the Woodland Village Lodges, which are cute, but we do have to walk a ways from the parking lot. The lodges are built to look like Lego log cabins, and are set in cul-de-sacs around central play areas. All the accommodations at Legoland are designed for families with young children, so the room is divided into an adult area with your normal hotel features of king size bed, tv, minifridge, kettle, wardrobe, etc, and a separate children’s area which has a bunk bed, a built-in Lego table with a tray of Lego to use, a projector nightlight, and a tv. There is also a scavenger hunt where we find clues in the Lego-themed murals in the room and use these to unlock a safe. Inside the safe is a cute Legoland lanyard and a small Animal Crossing Lego set. My son is delighted. He builds the set and then we shower and get ready for bed. It was a long day of sitting in the car and we’re tired. Some tea, a couple of chapters of our books and we fall asleep.

Daily totals: £54.25 for food and drink, £10.50 for the M6 toll 

Day two:

Breakfast is included in our accommodation, so we book a table and walk to the clubhouse restaurant to get it. There are only two option for breakfast, a cooked breakfast of sausage, bacon, egg, beans, mushroom, grilled tomato, hashbrown and toast, or pancakes with maple syrup, berries and bacon (either of these options can be requested vegetarian). There is also tea, filter coffee, orange juice, and apple juice to drink, and a selection of pastries, fruit, yogurt and cold cereals. We all opted for pancakes, and they were okay. They were served with the pancakes, bacon, and berries all stacked, all coated in maple syrup and dusted with powdered sugar, which made everything too sweet for my taste. I should have requested the syrup on the side. We manage to get our son to eat his bacon and mine, but he finds the pancakes too sweet and eats two croissants and an apple instead. We all have sensory issues with food, and our son doesn’t always get enough calories, so the breakfast is pretty close to a good meal. £0

We are staying at the resort, so we get early entrance to the park, so we head in at 9:30 and have a great morning on the rides. The weather is cool, cloudy and dry, and because the local schools are in session, the park isn’t crowded and many of the rides have no queues at all. We ride some of our favorites multiple times, trying to get our best scores on Laser Raiders and Ninjago: The Ride. 

Because it is not peak season, several of the food options in the park are shut, so we end up at the Pizza and Pasta Buffet in the Heartlake City area of the park. This is, without a doubt, the worst decision of the trip. Buffets are always what they are, but this one was even more what they are than usual. It was £22.50 each for Iain and me and £12.50 for our son to eat what I am sure was slightly undercooked frozen pizza. I did not examine the pasta. The salad bar was fully stocked though, so I did my best to eat £22.50 worth of salad. Iain and our son managed, but we all agreed we wouldn’t go back. 

We spent the afternoon on more rides, going on the Spinning Spider three times, and we spent an hour at Castaway Camp, a big pirate-themed playpark within the park. Near closing time, we headed to the shop and spent £47.99 on a Lego set and some keychains. We also use one of the penny squashers in the park and get a pirate one (my son collects these), £1.50

For dinner we left the resort and went to Wagama. On most trips, I try to put some effort into researching local places and finding somewhere to eat, but I dropped the ball this time. No complaints though, it was decent. I had tofu donburi, Iain had chicken katsu, and our son got a mini chicken katsu, £35 total plus £6 for parking. We walked by Windsor Castle and debated the best/worst royal families on the way back to the resort. My favorite is the Plantagenets (high drama), Iain likes the House of Alpin, and our son favors only the guillotine. Fair enough.

Daily Totals:  £92.50 for food and drink, £47.99 at the Lego shop, £1.50 for a squished penny, and £6 for parking

People watching highlights: Saw several women (not together) in spandex unitards with puffy gilets. Will this be the new default mum outfit? Would you wear it? 

Day three:

We face breakfast again, this time we all opt for the cooked breakfast, and it is better than yesterday’s pancakes. We all like different cooked breakfast components, so we order three whole ones and execute some switches at the table. I end up with three fried eggs, three hash browns, and lots of mushrooms. £0

We use our early entry to the park again and head to Miniland, where we see the workers cleaning and maintaining the various models. I reconsider my degree, reassembling Lego landscapes in the mornings is obviously what I should be doing with my life. Again the park is not crowded, so we enjoy short waits and ride our favourite rides multiple times. After our huge breakfast, we don’t really feel like lunch, so instead we get ice cream, two plain for £5.25 each and one with sprinkles for £5.50. There was only one size, and it was large; we probably could have split two instead of ordering three. We get an octopus squished penny at the Deep Sea Adventure, £1.50. We also go to the shop again, and our son spends the £25 his grandad gave him. Around 3pm, we started flagging, so we decided to go to mini-golf and then start heading home. Mini-golf was £5 each for resort guests, but you have to book online for the discount. There are four nine-hole courses with different themes, all housed in one big building located just outside the park. My dad is a serious golfer and spent a lot of time trying to teach me to golf, but with each lesson I somehow became worse, and Iain has golfed only once in his life, when he went to the driving range with my dad in an attempt to get in good with his father in law, and ended up sending the head of my dad’s club 300 yards. But, we’re born to struggle so we give the Medieval Mayhem course a go. I lose decisively (score: 34), but no clubs are harmed and we had fun.

We get to our car and head home. We drive to Coventry, where we leave the motorway and go to Costco for a cheaper fuel price. We fill the car back up for £23, and decide to eat dinner at Costco because we are all a bit sick of making decisions. £10.40 for three slices of pizza and 3 drinks. We discuss our favorite rides and I decide mine was the Jolly Rocker, a pirate-themed swinging ship, Iain’s is the Deep Sea Adventure, where you tour a big aquarium with black tipped sharks in a sort of glass-bottomed boat that’s styled as a submarine, and our son says his favourite was the Dragon, a roller coaster, but the ride he wanted to do the most times was the Lego Mythica flight simulator. We make one more stop on the way home for coffees, £7.25. In the dark, we are forced to abandon our Stobart rematch, so we’ll never know who is international lorry spotting champion. We arrive home happy to get in our own beds. 

Day Totals: food and drink: £33.65, minigolf: £15, squished penny: £1.50, fuel: £23

Trip Totals: £180.40 for food and drink, £440 for accommodations, park tickets and mini golf, £50.99 on the Lego shop and squished pennies, and about £70 worth of fuel. 

Total:  £742.39

**Section Five** Use this section to share how you afforded this trip.

How did you save up for this trip and for how long? 

Not particularly, in general we have a fairly low cost of living that allows us to take trips a few times a year. 

Did you accumulate credit card debt for taking this vacation?

No. We used our credit card to book but we pay it off every month. 

**Notes:** 

We didn’t realize it was an option until we went to book the mini-golf, but we could have booked a shark feeding session at the Deep Sea Adventure. If we go again, we will definitely do that. 

We liked the Woodland Village, but all of us thought we liked the slightly more expensive Legoland Hotel we stayed at last time a bit better (we had a pirate room). 

Iain and I booked this trip impulsively when our son mentioned he’d like to go again, but we should have put more research into the trip,  it would have been a nicer experience if we’d researched somewhere to stop in northern England, we could have gone to a museum/attraction and spent the night someplace on either our way down or back to break up all the time we spent in the car. We also should have put more consideration into what we'd eat. Both road trips and theme parks lend themselves to eating poorly and we definitely fell into that.

I (30m) recently started talking to a woman (27f) on hinge who like me has been having a rough time meeting people that are genuinely interested or want to purse something long term. We matched earlier in the week and we’ve primarily exchanged messages for a short period of time in the morning. We both laid out what we’re looking and even talked about the last person to just waste our time. I even mentioned how the last chick I talked to lied about what she wanted and slowly cut off communication and didn’t communicate for an entire weekend just to message me the day of a date and reschedule. She seemed very receptive to what I was looking for and empathized with what i’ve been dealing with and said she’d love to play video games with me and when I asked to get coffee this weekend she said “busy this weekend but next works better :)”. Okay there’s verified interest right? She’s struggling like me as well. To me saying yes to gaming and setting a rough time for a date is a big deal. Now I get that made it clear she’s busy this weekend and honestly she’s an attractive woman so she probably has a lot of other men competing for her attention. With that in mind the last messages I sent on Friday asked what games she likes and I mentioned i’d like to set an actual day and time for a date because I live far and want to plan a good date. I complimented her profile changes because they were cool and I gave her my info for discord and steam (gaming platforms). The thing is now she hasn’t said anything all weekend but she’s been on the app. I saw her profile changed when I was removing old matches that never made it to a conversation. I text messaged her today saying I hope her weekend is going good and never got a reply. I was thinking maybe I send one more message today or tomorrow restating my interest but it seems like she’s just ghosting me as well. Should I even send that last message today? Wait til tomorrow? I feel like I should just be direct and say how i’m feeling but don’t want to sound unreasonable since it’s only been a couple of days.",1,1760896885.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I am new to the world of espresso, but I love coffee and I am diving in head first. I've already ordered a Zerno Z1 which I will be using with my Brikka for the time being.

Anyway, with the grinder on order I've started looking at machines, and noticed what seems like a gap in the market.

I'm looking for a combination of these features, all of which are 100% dealbreakers:
1. Low noise (hard no on anything with a vibe pump)
2. Less than 5 minutes to heat up
3. Absolutely no apps or screens

Waiting 10+ mins for the machine to warm up is not something I have the patience for, and automated startup doesn't work with my highly inconsistent schedule. Noise is a concern because I am often making coffee at 5am like 15-20 feet away from my sleeping girlfriend. No app because as a software engineer my job is to be permanently frustrated with software that doesn't work.  Miss me with the apps please.

At one point, the obscurity surrounding Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes hinged only on whether Epstein himself was alive. His **“un-aliving”** didn’t end the story, it ripped the lid off a can of worms that Donald Trump has been trying, with his little hands and big ego, to cram back in ever since.

Not saying who did it, but you be the judge.

The factual data contradicting Trump’s denials has become a firehose of truth: victim testimonies, sworn depositions, photographs, public records, and even Trump’s own words. Between the Access Hollywood tapes, the E. Jean Carroll verdict, and statements from women who risked everything to speak, the foundations of these accusations are no longer rumor, they are reality.

And yet, his most loyal followers refuse to look.

# Ghislaine Maxwell:

Trump’s claim that he “barely knew” Ghislaine Maxwell is one of his weakest lies, and that’s saying something.

There are photos, parties, smiles, and shoulder-to-shoulder appearances that prove otherwise.  
Even Trump’s old interviews show admiration, not distance.

Maxwell wasn’t a bystander. She was a predator in pearls, a human horror wrapped in privilege.  
She groomed and delivered children to a monster and taught them to stay quiet. She participated in the abuse herself, by victim accounts.  
She wasn’t caught in Epstein’s shadow, she was the shadow.

Yet she’s been rewarded with a downgrade from a max-security cell to a white-collar “day work” prison where she can jog laps and sip coffee. A criminal architect of child exploitation now enjoys morning walks.

And what did Trump say? “I wish her well.”  
Not the victims. Not the survivors. Her.  
That one sentence reveals everything.  
For a man who “barely knew” her, he sure offers a lot of sympathy.

# Jeffrey Epstein:

Epstein knew Trump well enough to describe him perfectly: “A man with no conscience.”  
They were photographed together repeatedly, often surrounded by young women.  
Trump once said, “He likes them young,” as if that were a charming quirk, not a criminal red flag.  
[NBC archive footage shows Trump partying with Jeffrey Epstein in 1992](https://youtu.be/KLcfpU2cubo?si=IPmc1LTkQFXhh4y5)

The same man who called trump his best friend suddenly can’t remember, can’t comment, can’t tell you anything.

This isn’t coincidence; it’s pattern.  
The pictures, the parties, the overlapping circles of power, all of it paints the same story.  
But when that story surfaces, the reaction from his base is predictable: deflect, minimize, deny.

but later in his cell he would meet a questionable death. who kills themselves while wearing headphones?

Even *60 Minutes*—after reviewing hundreds of photographs from Epstein’s cell—could not close the gap between official narrative and unanswered questions. Broken cameras, falsified guard logs, and missing evidence made the official finding of suicide look less like closure and more like containment. Whether by incompetence or intent, the system shielded the truth once again.

You kind of have to ask, who benefits the most from the information Jeffrey had, and who stood to lose the most if he were to talk...

# The Birthday Letter

Among the friendlier relics of their relationship is a **birthday note** Jeffrey Epstein once sent to Donald Trump. The letter, discovered in Epstein’s seized address book and later cited in media reports, begins warmly: *“I wish I could be there to celebrate.”* It reads like correspondence between close social peers, not distant acquaintances.

For a man who later claimed he “barely knew” Epstein, the tone of the letter—and the fact that they exchanged personal notes at all, contradicts that public distancing. It’s a small detail, but it undercuts the carefully scripted amnesia Trump adopted once Epstein became radioactive.

Weird message, matching signatures....

[White House: Trump 'did not sign' Epstein birthday letter](https://youtu.be/_dBxgudoJpg?si=iN36VfU9shdKbdwt)

# The Myth of the Ban

After Jeffrey Epstein’s 2019 arrest, Donald Trump suddenly began claiming that he had *“banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago years ago”* because Epstein had allegedly tried to “poach one of his employees.”  
It’s a convenient story, one that paints Trump as a man of principle who acted early against Epstein’s behavior.  
[Trump reveals why he booted Epstein from Mar-a-Lago: 'Persona non grata'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m2_c6ThWLQ)

But there’s a problem: **no record of that ban exists.**

No written notice, no contemporaneous reports from Mar-a-Lago staff, no membership documents, and no police record show any such incident.

The supposed “poaching” story appeared **only after** Epstein’s arrest, when Trump was publicly distancing himself from his former friend and social companion in 2019. Before that, the two had been photographed together numerous times, attending the same parties, and speaking warmly of each other.

In other words, the “ban” functions less as a fact and more as a **retroactive alibi,** a line invented when association with Epstein became politically toxic.

Unless he was talking about Virginia Duffrey. If it was such an issue why didn't he bring it up sooner. and again why did he remember this specific girl years later.

# The Immunity Explained

That’s what this connection helps explain, **Trump’s long-running immunity**.  
Not just today, but over decades. Coercion claims, extortion allegations, fraud investigations, the list goes on.

Each time, he managed to sidestep accountability.

Wealth alone doesn’t buy that kind of luck.

It makes far more sense when viewed alongside **relationships built on leverage**.  
Epstein wasn’t merely a predator; he was a collector, of secrets, of favors, of power.  
People who moved in his circle knew that privacy was currency, and information was the weapon of choice.

Trump’s survival through scandal after scandal fits that pattern: someone who learned early that **the right alliances and the right silences** could protect him better than any lawyer ever could.

That allegation is part of the public record, but it has **never been adjudicated**.  
To stay accurate and safe to publish, you can acknowledge that directly, like this:

# The Fixer and the Silenced

Michael Cohen, one of Trump’s longtime fixers, admitted to reporter Tara Palmeri on her podcast that he would personally go to people’s homes to **intimidate and threaten** them. In one chilling recollection, he described following a woman’s address to a dead-end street, a lonely parking lot on the outskirts of the Bronx, where he confronted her to silence a potential story.

This strange admission lends **credence to “Katie Johnson”** (a pseudonym), a woman who described years of harassment after attempting to file a lawsuit against Trump and Jeffrey Epstein. She tried three times to bring her case forward; each attempt was met with **death threats**. Eventually, she withdrew her claim — but not before leaving behind a recorded interview in 2015 explaining her reasoning and recounting the details of her alleged abuse.

[Inside the Epstein Allegation Trump’s Fixer Tried to Shut Down](https://youtu.be/SZFL445YWvI?si=qGq3LrqavOCrg0MT)

# Katie Johnson’s Story

In that interview, Katie Johnson described an **alarming pattern of behavior** involving Trump, Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell.  
Her account included disturbing details of:

* Trump’s open **anti-Semitism**, even in the presence of his Jewish associate Epstein,
* His casual talk of a future political rise built on **deportations and racial division**,
* And an incident involving a **young Mexican girl**, which Johnson said revealed Trump’s cruelty and sense of ownership over the powerless.

One of the strangest recurring details she noted was Trump’s **fixation with germs,** a compulsive fear mirrored by Epstein himself.  
Both men, she said, shared a deep **germaphobia**, a trait that seemed to coexist with their willingness to violate every other boundary imaginable.

# A Network Built on Power, Not Just Flesh

Katie Johnson didn’t just describe Trump’s behavior around other people — she described a **criminal network**. According to her account, **Epstein gave orders to Ghislaine**, and **Ghislaine instructed the girls** to report back anything their “guests” said or did. Every conversation, every name, every secret, filtered back up the chain.

This wasn’t a simple trafficking operation.  
It was **an information-gathering enterprise** built on sexual exploitation, a system designed not only to gratify men like Epstein and Trump, but to **collect leverage** on those who participated.

That’s what sets this apart from ordinary vice.  
This was extortion disguised as decadence a web that reached into politics, finance, and law enforcement.

It wasn’t just about bodies.

It was about **control,** the kind of control that can choke a government from the inside out.

# Katie’s Experience

Katie Johnson, who said she was 13 years old at the time, ""**alleged"" that Donald Trump raped her** during gatherings hosted by Jeffrey Epstein in 1994.  
Her account, recorded in a 2015 interview and referenced in a 2016 lawsuit later withdrawn, describes Trump as violent, controlling, and exhibiting a fixation on germs, a trait she noted he shared with Epstein.

The case was **never tried in court**, and the allegations remain **unproven**.  
I won’t describe the details here; those who wish can watch the full thirty-minute interview.

but **viewer discretion is strongly advised**.  
[Katie Johnsons full 30 minute deposition.](https://youtu.be/t7oS6lcFE5c?si=h7xP0v0QkvY0dWw4)

# To Be Fair

To be fair, while Katie Johnson’s **allegation** has never been adjudicated, her description of events finds unsettling echoes in later, legally verified cases.

In E. Jean Carroll’s lawsuit, a federal jury found Donald Trump **liable for sexual abuse and defamation**, and Judge Lewis A. Kaplan went even further in his written opinion.

**He reminded Trump’s legal team that although New York’s statutory language used a narrower definition, what the jury found him to have done “is in fact rape as commonly understood.”**  
[Judge clarifies: Yes, Trump liable for rape](https://youtu.be/BScUsKuTU6c?si=StM1E3OmHNq--DFI)

That judicial statement gives weight to the broader pattern Johnson described years earlier—suggesting her account was not an isolated accusation but part of a consistent, disturbing picture of power, violence, and denial.

# The Duffrey Connection

Virginia Duffrey’s story threads directly through this web of power.

At sixteen, she was working at Mar-a-Lago when Ghislaine Maxwell approached her with what sounded like an opportunity.

That “opportunity” led her into Jeffrey Epstein’s circle, and ultimately into years of abuse and trafficking, a pattern that later became the foundation of her legal actions against Epstein and Prince Andrew.

What’s striking is Donald Trump’s own recollection.

He’s famous for claiming **a bad memory** whenever it protects him, from depositions to interviews, he **“doesn’t recall”** countless meetings, names, or events.  
Yet somehow, when it came to Duffrey, **he** ***did*** **remember.**

He once remarked that Epstein **“stole one of my employees from Mar-a-Lago,”** as if a teenage girl leaving with a predator were comparable to someone swiping a golf cart.

[Video of trump labeling Duffrey like property.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe0sEoxm9_U)

**That offhand comment speaks volumes.**

It shows awareness, ownership, and above all, **detachment,** the same emotional vacuum that runs through every part of this story.

Even after her death Duffrey wasn’t remembered as a victim.

She was remembered as lost property.

# Why TRUMP Never sues...

It’s telling that Trump sues journalists, governments, and even comedians, yet never sues the people who have **accused him of crimes against children**.

You’d think that kind of accusation would provoke immediate legal retaliation.

But it doesn’t.

And the reason, as always, is **discovery**.

Filing such a case would open the floodgates: travel logs, photographs, financial records, and witness statements, all admissible, all under oath.  
It would mean answering questions he’s spent decades dodging.  
He knows it. His lawyers know it. And that’s why he blusters in public but keeps his name off the docket.

He can’t afford the truth to be documented.  
Because in discovery, **silence isn’t control, it’s exposure.**

# The Psychology of Denial

That’s what this letter is about.  
Not just Trump’s guilt, but the refusal to see it.

When evidence emerges, his supporters don’t disprove it. They distract.  
When victims speak, they attack their credibility.  
When he’s cornered by facts, they call it a conspiracy.

This isn’t loyalty; it’s self-deception.  
It’s easier to live inside the illusion that your hero is perfect than to admit you’ve defended a predator.  
But that’s what’s happening: by choosing denial, by shouting “fake news” instead of facing reality, you’re defending the very people who exploited the powerless.

This is the basic concept of cognitive dissonance.

[Cognitive Dissonance Theory: A Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y17YaZRRvY)

# The Truth They Can’t Outrun

Epstein is dead. Maxwell is caged. Trump is still pretending he was never part of their orbit.  
But history doesn’t forget, and neither do the victims.

Every photo, every quote, every smirk caught on camera will outlive the slogans and chants.  
And someday, those still defending him will have to ask themselves,  
not whether Trump knew Epstein and Maxwell,  
but why they refused to care.

# The Supporters’ Reflection

What this says about his supporters is hard to ignore.  
They’ve seen the evidence. They’ve heard the victims. They’ve watched the trials.  
And still, they look away.

It shows who they’ve become.  
People willing to stomach cruelty, to justify corruption, to ignore the screams of the powerless, as long as they get what they want.  
That isn’t loyalty. It’s rot.

They have learned to live comfortably beside horror.  
To call evil “fake news.”  
To treat suffering as background noise.

And that’s the truth no one wants to face: **many are perfectly fine with sexual violence, even against children, if the man committing it carries their flag.**  
That is not politics anymore.  
That is moral collapse.",2,1760896698.0,RealityChecksReddit,0,1.0,False

I live in Kitchener and will be visiting Toronto with my brother next weekend. We'll be in Toronto Saturday evening and my brother's flying back to NL Monday at like 5 PM. I was thinking of either a hotel or Airbnb for Saturday night, Sunday all day+night, but not Monday night. Still, I need some place to work at on Monday. The thing is, I have to work, but I can WFH on Monday (and have to be in office Tuesday).

My ask: where can I find a hotel or Airbnb that doesn't have a checkout time of 11 AM? I need a place to work 8-4, basically.

There are a few options:

1. Get back to KW on Sunday evening, but then I'll be cutting my time spent with family :(
2. Get back to KW early Monday before work, which is doable but I've been checking the Go train/bus schedules and It seems like they leave after 9AM, which is ridiculous?! I know some friends who commute from KW to Toronto early mornings... but maybe there aren't many who commute from Toronto to KW?
3. I know I can work from a coffee shop or library in Toronto, but that's the last resort for now. I'd rather be in a quiet place/room.
4. \[Best case\] Find a hotel/Airbnb that I can checkout of at 2-3 PM.

**I'm trying to figure out how to plan for this given the restrictions I have:**

1. I don't drive/don't have a car. My brother drives but he can't drive me back on Monday since he has to be at the airport for his flight. It'll be too much to ask him to drive me back/etc. Unless we can push his flight back to Tuesday. He has friends he can stay with for the night.
2. I have to work on Monday. I only started my job 2 weeks ago, so I don't want to take time off!
3. I have a few friends in Toronto but I'm not super close with them and I would feel like I'm imposing on them if I ask to stay with them for the day. Although, this is a last resort option, too.

I don’t eat there too often but let’s just say it has been my lunch option a few times bc I wanted to flirt with him lol now fast forward it’s been like 6 months of on and off seeing him and sometimes he’s really friendly, most times he’s very sweet. There’s only been one or two times he wasn’t in a talking mood and he later explained that he was having a bad week etc. I’ve been trying to hype myself up to ask for his contact since it’s kind of awkward since he’s at work n so am I when I see him. Last week I ended up eating there not knowing he was gonna be there and I got my food then we talked for a while. My friend also told me when she hears me talking to him ( while we’re otp) I always cut the convo short but I do it bc I get nervous lmao so this time I kinda did that and went back to work but I was like hmmm I feel like being bold tonight bc he looked too good! So I went back to his job and was gonna act like I wanted a coffee (since he asked me why I wasn’t getting one when I went the first time) but when I saw him I was like “ look, I didn’t even come to order anything honestly I was just wondering if I can have ur instagram?” And he was like “ Of course. Yeah.” And gave it to me and said he’d follow me when he got home that night which was understandable bc it’s food service and they also were about to close. I waited that night and nothing. Now it’s going on 3 days later and I’m like ??? I’m confused bc I’m like was he never flirting back? Were his hands almost shaking for no reason when I handed him my phone? Like wtf am I delusional??? Also why would he give me his instagram if he didn’t want to now I feel like a creep lmaoo. It should also be noted that I screenshotted his account when I first got it to show my bff ( not in a weird way just showing her bag was secured) and now when I checked his account again I noticed he unfollowed a lotttt of ppl and his following went down a lot. I mean by like 60-100 so this is obviously intentional. I also should note I think he’s like 3 years younger than me which doesn’t bother me for once bc he’s HOT but I’m just like wtf does he not like me? And if not why did he look in my eyes like that omg. He’s a cute nerdy guy so I don’t think he’s a huge flirt it kinda took a while for us to even flirt but idk. I was thinking about taking my follow request back bc wtf do I look like sitting in the requests forever. I feel rejected but I’m also just confused on why tf he would give me his ig with a smile if he didn’t want to. Pls help.

1oavxnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1oavxnn/feeling_a_lack_of_momentum_in_my_marriage/,Feeling a lack of momentum in my marriage,"Hello all, I (37F) have been with my partner (42M) for 8 years, married for 6. We have one child together (5M).

As the title states- I have no barometer on what a normal relationship progression looks like and am feeling unseen and unheard and am looking for initial opinions on the matter. I’ve considered speaking to someone professionally but have never done that either so here goes.

Bottom line is- does everyone go through the motions of life without much “warm and fuzzy” feelings and instead feel like they are carrying resentment and walking on eggshells? I feel like it’s a long list of jokes or unspoken rules like below and catch myself feeling guilty for thinking this way. “Oh you know men, if you don’t ask them twice it won’t get done or it’s the woman’s job to raise the kids and take care of the household”.

For those of you who have time to read the details. I appreciate you. See below. ⬇️ 

Lately I have been feeling resentment towards my partner and I’d like to get past it but anytime I bring it up it is somehow my fault and a me problem? He stormed out when I tried to talk to him about how I was feeling to try to brainstorm ways- together- that we can get past this phase of our marriage. When I bring up difficult conversations or things he doesn’t like he just says “no” gets this look on his face and refuses to talk to me about it. So here I am.

Some background on basis of the resentment/unmet needs.
He naps a lot. Like every day a lot. He was out of work for 5 months and I gave him the benefit of the doubt- unfulfilled, he’s depressed, low iron/anemic, etc. But it was happening before that when he was working too and he is otherwise feeling fine he says. While he is working full time those naps fall to the evenings and I am left to do everything. When he is home (not working or on the weekends) he sleeps til 10, or takes a 3 hour nap in the afternoon- sometimes both. So I am working full time and tending to our 5 y/o and the household stuff by myself all the time. 

My days goes like this- get my sons lunch/snacks packed for school, get him up and dressed, fed breakfast, on the bus, go to work. Pick him up from afterschool care. Get home make dinner (sometimes my husband is still at work, other times he is home at the same time- he needs to “sit down for 5 minutes” which turns into staring at his phone on TikTok (or taking another nap) for however long it takes me to say “dinners ready”- another source of resentment at I don’t TikTok nor do I watch much tv- he HAS to have the tv on at all times- even to sleep and I need silence so we don’t even sleep in the same room but we came to that decision together as our sleep needs don’t mesh). Then I draw my son’s bath, get his teeth brushed and pjs on, and we read a few books together then it’s lights out. My husband took over book time after a previous conversation that I was feeling burnt out but he is in and out in under 5 minutes (only one book no chatting about his day or snuggles and I’m guilty I’m in there about 20 mins as it’s the only time I’ve seen our son all day and he is a really cuddly little fellow. But I’m ok with the difference- my son however would rather I do everything all the time.

His attitude towards co-parenting and “wifely duties” also gets under my skin. He has said on multiple occasions it’s the “woman’s job” to raise the children and do the housework. Everything changed when I went back to work after having our son (didn’t wake up to the pattern of defaulting everything to me for the previous 3 years of our relationship) as I worked 8-6 and would still have to pick up our son, then cook dinner and run bath time etc. I snapped as he got home at 430 everyday and would often be… you guessed it… napping when we got home. No foresight to start cooking dinner etc. I explained how overwhelmed and burnt out I was going back to work (as a veterinarian at a very busy fully booked clinic by the way- not exactly a low stress job but I love every minute of it- the one thing that does provide me with feedback/feelings of success/satisfaction) and adding childcare responsibilities (all of them) and he offered to start picking our son up from daycare and making dinner on days he got home before me. So he’d cook 4 days a week and I would cook the other 3 (every day I’m home). That has reduced my overwhelmed state to a manageable level for the past 5 years but his new job now is shift work so he won’t be home til a- same time as me and we know how that goes, b- 8pm and I’ve had to do everything already, or c- 1am and yup you’ve guessed it- all me again. On the weekends he will help if I ask him to but he’s more than happy to just blindly stare at his phone, the tv, or nap. I am the only one who will play with our son, take him outside, teach him about the planets or bring out the writing practice books, coloring books or painting supplies, etc. my sons asks a lot of questions about the world around him and I am always more then happy to answer/teach him. My husband would rather not be bothered and he will just let our son pick a tv show and stare at his phone. And yes- I have already told him that it worries me that he is not “present” when he’s with our son, it’s too much tv time, he is a sponge right now and needs to learn everything, and I just get told he’ll parent his way and I can parent my way.

As you can imagine my segs drive is non-existent. Overwhelmed and burnt out, maybe 1 hour of “me time” in the evening then off to bed to do it all over again. This is another “wifely duty” as my husband calls it and so I’ll keep up a minimum frequency even though I’m not all that into it just to keep the peace. Wrong to do something you don’t want to do in that moment- yes but it’s just easier then dealing with the guilt when it is brought up to inevitably be my fault again that I’m feeling disconnected and not in the mood. Prior to kids it was equally initiated 2-3 times a week and I knew things would change after having kids but zero?

Also as a key point- his relationship with our son or co-parenting perspective. As above he feels it’s the “womans job”. “You’re better at it than I am”. “No one taught me any of this”. This meant that for the first 18 months of my sons life he barely picked him up, never fed him (breastfed and I had no problem getting up through the night with him as my partner was still working at the time). When he started to be around more my son naturally wanted me to do everything and there were a lot of tears as he got used to my partner occasionally doing things with him like bathtime or putting down for sleep- because I had had another breakdown as we moved across country and I no longer had any friends or family nearby (and yes it was his idea to move far away- more below). He is constantly barking orders at my son “don’t walk on your tippy-toes”, “go get dressed” when my son wants to wear his pjs on a Sunday, my son never had the fun sensory play in his food when learning to eat solids as my husband has an issue with mess (seeing red kind of issue) my son has had to sit still, don’t jump, clean up your toys, don’t make a lot of noise (usually because daddy is sleeping) for fear of getting yelled at- he’s only 5… I’ve just started asking him to take his laundry to the hamper when he strips down for bathtime or take his empty plate to the kitchen when we’re done dinner as I feel he is NOW old enough to start learning responsibility but my SO has felt our son should be boot-camp style “trained” from the get go. For some reason over the past few months I’ve seen all this going down from a third person view and I see my son walking on eggshells around his dad and I’m not sure how that is going to affect him down the line. As such- whenever daddy forces a hug on him it is brief and either pushed away or limp doodle-ed through but he’s always eager for a hug from me. He still to this day would prefer I do everything and here’s something my husband randomly asked my son last week “how would you feel about daddy moving out and it being you and mommy all the time?”… umm why ask that?? And he already knew the answer. A resounding “Yay!!” from my son. Maybe 5 is too young to comprehend he meant forever, like he thought it was just going to be another evening just the two of us like when my partner works late but still… I feel like my son can never really relax around my husband and just this morning when the third “order” was “barked” - to not jump around because he was making the whole house shake 🙄 my son looks at me with this look like “I don’t know what to do here can you help me?” And proceeds to climb onto my lap where I am finishing my morning coffee. I heard the eggshells crack this morning when that happened so that’s kinda why I’m here.

My final “realization” is that my husband has some anger issues, though he would never physically hit me, he hurts my feelings atleast monthly enough for me to ugly cry in the bathroom and now when I go to leave to be alone- he follows me. When I lock the door? He gets the poker out, unlocks it storms in and tells me to “never walk away from him again” “you can’t leave like that”. I try to talk to him about how he hurt my feelings but it’s always somehow my fault. I am recognizing several signs of coercive control (he couldn’t stop me from seeing my family but used Cov-id as an excuse to let no one near our son until he moved us a 14 hour drive away instead, like I felt like a zoo exhibit holding my son in front of the window for my parent to “meet” their first grandchild through the glass cause I kept pushing it) but that is a topic for a different post entirely.

I have purchased Lundy Bancrofts “Should I stay or Should I Go” and “Why does he do that” but I never have time alone to even read them. They are hidden away in my glove box for a stolen 5 minutes on a lunch break but until this new job I was literally never without him around. He offered to do the one task he’s occasionally ok with doing (other months it’s “too much”) which is go grocery shopping with our son, so I can finally reach out for advice.

If you’ve made it this far- I commend you and  look forward to any advise you may have. There will likely be a delay in responding as he would very quickly ask “what are you doing” or “who are you texting” if I attempted to look while he’s next to me.

Thank you in advance- one worn out momma who has no idea if this is normal “manly” behavior or not 😮‍💨",1,1760895802.0,emotionalabuse,0,1.0,False
1oavxn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontocraftbeer/comments/1oavxn8/pumpkin_beer_review_11_whitewater_brewing_company/,Pumpkin Beer Review #11: Whitewater Brewing Company Pumpkin Spice Espresso Porter,"**Whitewater Brewing Company Pumpkin Spice Espresso Porter: 5/10**

OK, yesterday I said there would be pumpkin in the next beer but this is just pumpkin spice without the pumpkin. Which is fine, still counts.

I’m really having a hard time with this one, I had to sit there and figure out if I liked it. After around half the glass, I like it, but I’m not sure how much I like it. The coffee flavour comes through more than I was expecting, which makes me wonder just how caffeinated this is. The pumpkin spice once again, is *very* mild. I’m only around 50% sure that I can taste the cinnamon, and I really couldn’t guess if there’s nutmeg or anything else in this. I just don’t see the point of putting the words pumpkin spice in big letters on the can if people can’t taste the spice.

I think that’s where my conflict is coming from. It’s not bad a porter and I like the slightly bitter edge that the coffee gives it here. The flavours are moderately well balanced, but it’s just not blowing my mind. But this isn’t a bad beer by any stretch, I feel like maybe despite being a “pumpkin spice” beer, maybe I’m not the target market for this one. If you really like porters and like the idea of an espresso porter, you’re probably going to like this. If you were really hoping for the pumpkin spice to come through, you will be disappointed. Ironically the font for the words “pumpkin spice” is probably four times the size of the words “espresso porter”, this is an espresso porter with just a tiny hint of spice.

I previously gave Big Rig’s Tales from the Patch a 7/10 for being a good porter, despite it only deserving a 4/10 as a pumpkin beer.

His research shows globally the code drinking community is drinking some of latte, where espresso is just an ingredient, and not the main beverage. Some people are quoted as believing that black coffee is the most boring drink. 

Have you watched/listened to this? I have actually been noticing this trend even in Europe where people were traditionally diehard black coffee drinkers, while drinking the occasional milk drink.

The father asked, 'Why did you say good-bye Grandpa?'

The little girl said, ""I don't know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do.""

The next day grandpa died.
The father thought it was a strange coincidence.

A few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her prayers which went like this, ""God bless Mommy, God Bless Daddy and good-bye Grandma.""

The next day the grandmother died.

""Holy crap"" thought the father, ""this kid is in contact with the other side.""

Several weeks later when the girl was going to bed the dad heard her say, ""God bless Mommy and good-bye Daddy.""

He practically went into shock. He couldn't sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office.

He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch and watched the clock.. He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay.

He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. Finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.

When he got home his wife said, ""I've never seen you work so late. What's the matter?""

He said, ""I don't want to talk about it, I've just spent the worst day of my life.""

1oavswm,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1oavswm/scribbling_through_the_scars/,Scribbling Through the Scars,"Losing your Mom... man, it just rips through you. It leaves these raw, gaping wounds that feel like they'll never close. And when that heavy blanket settles in, it can feel suffocating. Even getting out of bed, making a cup of coffee – feels huge. I get it, truly. I've been there, recently.

But listen, there's a powerful, almost primal tool you already hold: your ability to write the memories down. This isn't about writing some polished paper. It's about the raw, unfiltered act of getting those memories of your loved one down – out of your brain and onto paper or into a dedicated online memorial. The good ones, the ones that make you smile through tears. The bad ones, the arguments, the frustrations – yeah, those too. The ugly, the heartbreaking, the moments that still catch your breath. All of it.

From a scientific angle, what you're doing isn't just journaling; it's called **expressive writing**, and it's a proven way to actually *process* all that emotional chaos. \[e.g., Pennebaker & Chung, 2007, *The Psychological Science of Everyday Life*\]. When you force yourself to put those swirling thoughts and memories into a dedicated space, whether it's a personal journal or an online memorial site, you're engaging the part of your brain that organizes and makes sense of things – your prefrontal cortex. It's like you're taking that overwhelming internal storm and giving it a narrative, a structure. This cognitive restructuring, as clinicians call it, can genuinely dial down the intensity of those crushing emotions and stop your mind from endlessly replaying the same painful loops. It's literally helping to rewire your brain's response to this trauma. Studies, like the ones by Pennebaker and Chung, show how powerful this is for easing depressive symptoms and just making you feel a bit more human again.

It's going to be tough, I won't lie. It might feel like picking at a wound, bringing all that pain right back to the surface. But by writing down those raw memories, you're not just reliving the hurt; you're actively *processing through* it. You're transforming it from this shapeless, suffocating weight into something you can actually look at. This act of externalizing your grief, of giving it a voice and a form, is a crucial, brave step in truly healing. It paves the way for finding a new kind of peace.

So, take a deep breath. Choose your outlet – whether it's a pen and paper or a digital space. Your healing journey, messy and real as it is, is waiting for you on those pages or within that memorial.

1oavn7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1oavn7n/21_want_advice/,21 want advice,"Sorry for the badly formatted yap to come, I need honest opinions on my situation.

Had a terrible past two or so years. I'm in australia and I'm in my 3rd year of CS. A bit of background, in my first year I was doing rather alright. I was averaging 80-90 on my units but didn't really know how to make the most of my degree at that time.

Fast forward to early second year. Due to family and personal issues outside of my control I had to withdraw from my units late into a semester and as a result got 0 for 4 units which i can't scrape off my record no matter what i try. This was also around the time when all the 'CS is useless!' dooming began. I'll be honest, that combined with a terribly ran couple of units with a genuinely rude, inept and spiteful teaching team ruined the degree for me. 

I have been doing average in my studies with a few more fails here and there since and I have absolutely no motivation knowing that I'll instantly get filtered from any internship or job I apply to. As far as i'm concerned the only benefit of this degree currently is either postgrad, research or landing internships. All of which i can't do thanks to my transcript. Basically my degree seems even more useless than everyone makes it seem. I can't transfer out as my overall grades are too low and i don't think I can afford the time and money investment of postgrad. I haven't been able to land a single internship after that second year incident either, though i've been able to land a select few interviews.

My interests going in to this were either going into graphics programming or trying to land cool low level stuff at hardware or gpu companies like AMD/Nvidia or do ML research. As far as i'm concerned all of these are now impossible for me based purely off my abysmal transcript, not even mentioning the lack of those roles in aus. My goal was to use those as a financial backbone and a way to gain industry knowledge before eventually branching out to start a business and work for myself, probably something like a game studio or something related to stuff i learned along the way. It's also probably the only thing I have a true passion and urge to do. But without money, how can I do that?

I cannot help but feel as if I'm absolutely screwed? Seeing all this stuff about people with better credentials than me being unable to land a job is also quite harrowing. Also, most of my friends and people i've known from school or in my classes seem to have been able to get into some kind of internship or professional ""network"" and I seem to have missed the boat to join those a long time ago and that it's too late for me to do what they did now.

My life feels like some worst case scenario parody. I haven't been able to land any job in my field at all and I need money to pursue my dreams which I can't get without a job, my only option seems to nurture up a side hustle or something. 

Unrelated to that (skip this sob story) i've atrophied, gotten fatter and feel like an invisible joke amongst people I know. I have been tired all the time and procrastinating doing my assignments. I cannot even begin to focus on them. I am copping 4 day late penalties on my assessments. I don't know man. I've noticed people becoming genuinely racist recently too. I have brown skin, some bogan in the city threw their hot ass coffee at me yelling something about indians. I'm not even from the same continent as India. I see people my age spreading genuine hatred towards brown people, I have people I know and thought I was friends with telling me i'll never date anyone or be desirable at all because i'm a brown person. Stuff I see online just reinforces that world view. That's lowkey a terminally online incel way if thinking though, so i don't really pay much attention to it. Bothers me regardless.

With that yap out of the way, what the hell can i do?

I can't just drop out of my degree as I have asian parents who would genuinely disown me if i do. I genuinely have passion for this shit too, just my transcript saps all of that out. I have a year and a half left, of course i'm graduating late. My current plan is to somehow lock something in and score as good as possible to salvage my transcript, while also continuing to build out projects related to where I want to work, maybe ship something that can get users. But even then I don't think it would help as I wouldn't be likely to get internships or any grad role until the very end. 

To add insult to injury I haven't worked a proper part time job in a fat while. Last time was like 2022. I'm eating through my own savings while living rent free like a goblin. I was hoping i'd be able to find ANY job related to my degree but i just spend every recruitment cycle applying and getting rejected.

I'm not even saying any of this is not my fault either, if anyone was wondering. Only I am capable of letting it get this bad. I am entirely in fault.

I would like to accomplish some of my dreams or end goals, I just don't see how its feasible in this current situation.

tldr academic transcript is FUCKED. not sure about how i'll go about landing internships with it or making use of my degree AT ALL.

Any advice whatsoever would be appreciated. I am considering hanging myself unironically. ",1,1760895121.0,findapath,1,1.0,False
1oavmw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/minot/comments/1oavmw2/minot_williston_family_medicine_residency_program/,Minot (+Williston) Family Medicine Residency Program,"For the medical students applying FM. Because their website has virtually no information. I'm currently an intern.

General: Unopposed. There are some MS3s/MS4s from UND and Idaho COM. In a rural area. Minot city population 40,000. Williston 30,000. People live here for farming, oil industry, or the air force base. The oil boom has made the area more diverse than it was 50 years ago. We take a bunch of solid IMGs from a variety of countries. I'm American.

PD: Sandroni is the program director. He's good. Takes concerns seriously, especially if you have a physical meeting with him. I had trouble figuring out the labor and delivery structure/system at our hospital and he contacted a bunch of people to help me figure it out.

Locations: All rotations within a 10 minute drive at Center for Family Medicine for our residency clinic, Medical Arts building for outpatient pediatrics, and Trinity hospital which is attached to a medical office building for basically everything else. Most residents live in a nice new apartment complex about midway between clinic and the hospital. I live a 5 minute walk from the ER.

Intern year in order from least chill to most chill:

3 months of inpatient: 6/7am-6:30pm, 6 days a week. Only days during intern year. 2nd years do 2 weeks of nights, 2 weeks of days. 9 months total of inpatient over residency. Our attendings all know their stuff. 1st/3rd years have Fridays off. 2nd years have Saturdays off. Interns carry like 3-5 patients usually, maybe more later in the year and/or on the 2nd year's day off. 2nd years do carry patients.

1 month L+D: 7-7, 5 days a week, no nights or weekends unless you feel like it. 2 months total of L+D through residency. We are unopposed. OBGYN has private practice vibes. It's a 6 OB practice who usually deliver their own patients if they don't have a resident with them. Not a laborist OB model.

1 month ER: 2 days off a week. Latest shift goes until 3am, earliest starts at 6am. Do 4 days of each 9 hour shift type at a time. Then Sunday off, clinic day, Tuesday off, new shift schedule.

1 month gynecology: it's OB clinic.

1 month newborn nursery

1 month sports medicine

2 months pediatric outpatient

1 month orientation starts July 1st.

1 month behavioral health

1 month community/population medicine

2nd year: 4 months inpatient, month of ER pediatrics, month of ICU, month of geriatrics (do the admits for the nursing home), go to Colorado for a month for inpatient pediatrics because our hospital doesn't get too many kids (might even be a Monday through Friday inpatient thing), month of L+D, month of dermatology, month of surgery that our chiefs got switched this year to being mostly surgery clinic to learn pre/post op stuff more than surgery stuff, an elective, and a month of clinic.

3rd year: 2 months inpatient, 5 electives, orthopedics, health systems management, ICU, clinic, ER, podiatry

Call: 2nd/3rd years do Friday/Saturday nights of inpatient and are on backup. Attendings are available by phone overnight. The nocturnist for the main hospital service is also in the hospital, shows up to codes/rapids, and is usually a former program graduate. So they help if there are issues. There's also an ICU night NP.

Wellness: Wellness activities are structured with a curriculum, led by Naslund who is also provides therapy for the program (I think). Socially: residents have barbeques, dinner, get together to play basketball, board games, we're having a halloween party, etc

The hospital systems in North Dakota will actively recruit you. A couple people stayed on as hospitalists. Some people stay in the area.

Perks/Lecture: Parking is free. We get a garage door opener for the underground heated hospital parking. The hospital gives us about 570$ a month in cafeteria food. The cafeteria food is midwestern.

*“Will I love my second child as much as I do my first one?”*

I was perplexed by this question when I first heard that a couple of dads had asked it as they prepared for the arrival of their second child. Looking back on the anticipation for our second child’s arrival, I don’t ever remember being worried about not feeling the same joy and excitement for our second son as I felt when we had our first son, Braden. 

Nearly two decades later, that smart-alleck second son, Jayden (now 19), would probably jokingly say something like, “It’s probably because you were never that crazy about Braden, (now 22)  in the first place, right dad?”, but nothing could have been further from the truth. I love(d) Braden! Being present for his birth was one of the highlights of my life, and I loved the responsibilities that went along with being a dad. Braden had such a sweet personality, wonderful smile, and contagious laugh that it made me want to be with him all of the time. When he would saunter over and say his favorite word, “*haaug”* (hug), and wrap his tiny arms around you, it was impossible for your heart not to melt.

Because I was so crazy about Braden and loved him so much, it didn’t really cross my mind to be worried about Jayden’s arrival, at least in terms of how I thought I would feel about him. I truly expected that I would love being a dad to Jayden just as much as I did with Braden (and I was right!).



**Some Fears Behind the Question**

But as I ponder the question a little more, I can understand why new dads of a second child might be apprehensive about bringing a new baby into the fold. Babies can be expensive, and adding a second child can certainly be hard on the pocketbook. A newborn’s sleep schedule can be difficult for parents to establish, and if there’s a toddler who is not on a consistent sleep schedule, things become that much more difficult (and parents are even more tired). But for me, the biggest challenge I felt when adding a second child to the family was the feeling of being outnumbered. When Jayden came home from the hospital, my wife and I were quickly hit with the realization that we no longer had a numerical advantage. While we could tag-team things like Braden’s bedtime routine, diaper changes, nap schedules, and morning dressings, now we were often playing one-on-one, with one of us handling the duties of caring for a newborn while the other caring for the needs of a two-year old. Even simple things like going to the grocery store or meeting a friend for a cup of coffee became much more difficult, because you knew that if you left the house on your own, you were leaving your spouse outnumbered for a substantial amount of time, and sometimes crazy things could happen.



**The Boys’ and My Slimy, Green Jellybean Adventure**

Never did I feel more outnumbered than once when my wife had to go out of town for a convention for three or four days and I had to take care of the boys by myself.  Jayden was only a few months old and Braden was a rambunctious almost-three-year old with a penchant for finding trouble. Needing to get some items from the grocery store, I arrogantly decided to take the boys for an outing.  I expertly had Jayden in his baby carrier and Braden was riding in the child seat of the grocery cart. Braden could get a little bit squirmy at times, but he really enjoyed me giving him a jelly bean every couple of minutes for a fun snack. Things were going well - the boys were quiet and calm, I was filling up the cart with the things we needed, and I was even getting some smiles and “you’re such a good dad” nods from the grandmotherly types that we encountered in the aisles. 

It didn’t take long, however, for everything to come crashing down. When reaching into Jayden’s baby carrier to check on him, I discovered it was filled with runny, greenish diarrhea that had moved up his back and was into his hair. Green, smelly slime everywhere! While I was coming up with a plan on how to deal with that mess, Braden started shrieking and crying. I couldn’t figure out what was wrong at first, but then I noticed that he had jammed a jelly bean so far up his nose that neither he nor I could get it out. I didn’t think he was in any danger, but I’m sure his screaming could be heard from across the store.

What do you do in a situation like that? You pack up your kids and high-tail it out of there, that’s what! I felt bad for leaving a full cart of groceries in the middle of the store for employees to put away, but I really had no choice. When we got home, Braden was able to be distracted enough by one of his DVD’s of The Wiggles to stop crying, so I was able to give Jayden a bath and put him down for a nap. I then put my surgical skills to the test and successfully used tweezers to extract a yellow jelly bean from Braden’s nostril. Later, after cleaning the baby carrier, I celebrated my survival by cracking open a beer and ordering a pizza.



**The Good Stuff**

While it’s easy to focus on crazy situations like that, those types of things are few and far between and are just part of the deal when you become a parent (and you laugh about them later on). The problems associated with having a second child can be stressful, but are short-term. The long-term love and benefits our family received from having a second (and later a third) child (now 17) were boundless, and I couldn’t imagine it being any other way.  As the boys got older, they became playmates and would sometimes spend hours together playing legos or putting on “puppet shows” with the dozens of stuffed animals they had in their rooms. They both have a great sense of humor, and it was always fun to hear one shout “Fire in the hole!” from a bedroom while the other activated a well-used Whoopie Cushion.  Braden has special needs, and in middle and high school it was often his younger brother, Jayden who looked out for him and was the one to drive him to school, to work, or to Special Olympics practice. Now that Jayden is in college and living in another state, Braden looks forward to his brother’s visits home and the laughter and fun he brings to our family.

Adding second and third children to our family has brought my wife and I fulfillment in ways that we didn’t even anticipate. *“Will I love my second child as much as I do my first one?”*  For me, the answer was a definite “yes”, and the love in our family grows exponentially as the years go by.",1,1760894874.0,DadAdvice,0,1.0,False

1oavfsg,https://i.redd.it/ygi98x5sr3wf1.jpeg,My first Reddit book review Before We Forget Kindness by Toshikazu Kawaguchi,"Just finished ""Before We Forget Kindness"" by Toshikazu Kawaguchi. This book is the fifth book of the novel series ""Before the Coffee Gets Cold"" . For those who haven't read the previous four books of the series, this series is about a mysterious cafe in Tokyo, Japan where customers can time travel. There are some strict rules which the customers need to follow like, returning before the coffee gets cold, meeting only those people in the past or future who have visited the cafe atleast once in their lives, among others. Though the reality cannot be changed no matter what, you can still feel satisfaction in the thought that you could go back/forward in time and do or say whatever you wanted to. The book focuses on heartwarming stories about love, loss, forgiveness and regret with a mix of joy and longing. 
The book is known for its gentle and emotional storytelling. It is also very easy to read. The author very deftly manages to touch the emotional chord of the readers through his poignant and moving take on time travel. The author not only talks about the lives of the customers visiting the cafe for time travel but also about the lives of the owner and the staff of the cafe and how they get connected to each and every customer approaching them for time travel in a very beautiful and heartwarming way.
The book gives a very powerful message through its touching depiction of time travel. There are people in our lives whom we hurt sometimes knowingly or sometimes unintentionally without understanding their point of view and realising that we might never see that person again. When we realise, sometimes it's too late and we have to live with that feeling of regret the rest of our lives.  There are times when a loved one hurts us and we never recover from that pain. We cut them off our lives and that hurt lingers within us a long time. We never heal. But we can't move on either. Sometimes, we don't realise that the other person might have had a valid reason for their behavior towards us and we might have just misunderstood them. We want to listen, forgive and reconcile with them but sometimes, it's too late and we lose them forever. There are times, when we have loved someone and did not have the courage to confess our feelings to that special person. Time passed, we moved on, but that regret still lingered in our heart without knowing what would have happened if you had just gathered the courage and confessed. And we live with that forever. 
So please, if you love someone, tell them without worrying about the consequences.  If you have hurt someone and realised your fault, please apologise to them and ask for their forgiveness. Please forgive a loved one and move on. Please don't leave anything unsaid and undone. Please be kind, please love wholeheartedly, please apologise and please forgive and reconcile when there's time. Because, unlike the book, we cannot go back in time and act/say what we wanted to even if for our own satisfaction in our real life.",1,1760894651.0,bookporn,0,1.0,False
1oavfph,https://i.redd.it/d8xwy8qur3wf1.jpeg,Rediscover life’s juice and creativity through tiny breaks in your routine.,"Last Tuesday, 7 AM, hot cup of coffee at hand, the dawn was just around the corner. A beautiful, silent and peaceful morning.

And I was running my morning routine like a robot. Meditation, journaling, reading, writing, learning.

Neither very inspired nor super excited.

Atomic Habits by James Clear is on everyone’s lips. How do we create a structure of advantageous behaviors so that our life is, in a way, steered on autopilot in the right direction? Excellent questions - and I myself use various techniques from his book, such as behavior stacking, in my morning routine and thereby practice meditation daily and have been successfully learning Japanese and playing the piano for a year.

But what if we’re fed up with our routines? What if we feel the need to break out of the dull monotony of repeating behavior patterns and routines? If you often feel sluggish, unmotivated, and above all uninspired, then read on. I will show you a technique that the legendary music producer Rick Rubin presents in his book Creativity-The Art of Being.

Rubin introduces a fantastic tool to overcome creative down periods.

It is closely connected with the tension between the comforting, calming, but boring security of our comfort zone and the stimulating, energizing, but exhausting refreshment of discovering new territory.

He recommends turning things upside down more often, experiencing something new to intentionally disrupt routines and see familiar things as if for the first time.

Creativity thrives in openness and uncertainty, not in repetition and comfort.

He suggests that when life feels dull or uninspired, we should invert habits, turn things upside down or, in other words, deliberately seek the unfamiliar.

His idea is strongly connected to the Japanese concept Shoshin, or Beginner’s Mind, by Zen master Shunryu Suzuki that I learned about in the Nike founder‘s biography Shoe Dog.

When life gets dull or you can’t come up with a solution to a problem look at the world and everything in it with fresh eyes, curiosity, and openness.

But what if you’re stuck in your daily routine? How do we come up with a fresh perspective when we feel like we’re stuck in a corner?

How can you stay open and energized? How can you break out to get your creativity moving and live a more inspired life?

When it comes to breaking routines, your brain is your enemy.

Some people, especially those who deal with self-development, will exclaim: “But my routines are positive! I have integrated routines into my life that move me forward. My routines are routines that bring me closer to my goals.”

Same here. At the same time, sometimes I’m dying of boredom! I’m craving something new that makes my senses tingle. This concept is called Sensation Seeking in psychology. It’s a trait defined as the tendency to seek out novel and intense experiences. In some people it is more pronounced, in others less so.

Tony Robbins describes a similar idea in his Six Human Needs model, where he explains that we’re constantly moving in the tension field between certainty and comfort on one side, and variety or uncertainty on the other. Every human has both needs: the need for safety, stability, and predictability, and the need for change, surprise, and new stimuli.

I trigger that change and surprise by seeking micro adventures in my everyday life. Christo Förster defines them as small, “self-contained“ adventures that require little time, money, and planning.

In my everyday life, I try to seek micro adventures whenever I can. They can go all the way from small variations to my daily routines, like taking a different route to work, visiting a different café, restaurant, or bar without any expectation to taking my bike and cycle to the next city while camping on the way.

Emotionally intense or novel experiences are more likely to be strongly encoded and vividly remembered. That’s why “first times” or highly emotional events often stick in our minds.

Those events make us feel alive and awake. They inspire us. They give us what we’re often yearning for when we escape into daydreams of vacations in our everyday lives. We’re searching for variation.

Tony Robbins names the need for variation as one of the six human needs. They’re all bipolar – so as much as we need variation, we need stability, which is why it’s so satisfying to come back home after a day of adventures and new impressions. We want to feel safe, protected, and calm again. It’s a constant field of tension.

So: Kick your brain’s butt. Don’t be afraid to break out of your routine every once in a while.

Feed yourself some new experiences and memories.

Be courageous! Challenge your brain with a complete lack of purpose

For myself I have identified two factors for good micro adventures:

1. Lack of purpose
2. Novelty

If your brain is yearning for a purpose, just shut it down by telling it that you’ll go visit this or that café. That’s how strong our brain’s urge to have a finishing line is - its urge to have a goal and a desired outcome to create motivation.

Unfortunately, most cool adventures happen on the way. In the process. While you’re actually on your way to achieving what you had set out to do.

I remember that day when I went on an adventure with my buddy. We simply went cycling across parts of the city, which we hadn’t explored up until then. The simple act of cycling through unknown streets and parks was so stimulating and refreshing without any purpose or goal connected to it.

But your brain doesn’t care. It wants a reason. I use the “pseudo-destination“ as a trick. I tell my brain, “Okay, I’ll head for that café.”

Another factor for a good micro adventure: whatever you do, do something new.

- A new place
- A new person
- A new topic
- A new sensory experience: see something new, hear something new, taste, smell, or feel something new
- Keep it (very) very simple - stare at the ceiling instead of the wall

Don’t overcomplicate it.

Taken to the extreme, a micro adventure can be as simple as a physical change of perspective.

It can be as simple as moving your chair to another corner of the room at home, just to see things through a different lens.

If we break the whole thing down to the bare minimum, then the following story fits in well:

A few weeks ago, I went through a particularly stressful period. A difficult and complex project that came with many thoughts, questions, and doubts. Meetings, conversations, decisions to be made. Every evening my head was full of thoughts. The kind of thoughts that make you dwell on them. Did I say the right thing? Should I have said something else?

One of those days I came home, completely exhausted. Maybe you know those moments or evenings when you actually have nothing planned, so you’re basically free to do whatever you want. For some reason, though, you just don’t have the drive. The energy and enthusiasm to make a decision are missing.

That evening I decided to simply lie down on the floor in my study, with my legs propped up on my favorite armchair. To my surprise, this change of perspective inspired new thoughts, new ideas and new solutions in me.

So: Considering how difficult it is to intentionally break routines: Keep it ridiculously simple. As simple as putting your chair into a different corner.

The mix is what makes the magic - balance novelty and comfort. 

When I come home from a bike trip I’m exhausted and just want to have a coffee in my living room, look outside the window, sleep in my bed. The last is especially true when you’ve been sleeping for weeks or even months on a thin isolation or yoga mat and just want a comfy bed.

Tim Ferriss recommends stepping outside your comfort zone by trying to strategically eliminate things we’ve gotten too used to. Yet another interpretation of seeing the world through fresh eyes and triggering a fresh perspective.

In a sense, that’s what happens when you do micro adventures. Having the courage of leaving the known behind, even if it‘s just for a short moment.

This is how we feel alive. It’s how memories are made and what can kick us out of a slump.

So stop staring out of the window and get your ass to do, see, feel, or experience something new.

Even if it’s just staring at the ceiling from the floor’s perspective instead of staring out of the window as you usually do. Who knows what you’ll discover!

So how to kick your butt to actually break your routine from time to time?

I’m hoping to get some guidance.  We only make French Press and we use a 1.5 liter as we drink a lot of coffee.  I’m tired of muddy coffee and need a new grinder.  

I bought the Baratza Virtuoso plus but there was way too much plastic in the burr grinder area for our taste.  

Bought the Gen 2 Ode but have not opened it because I’m not sure it’s the best option.  

While the Gen 2 Ode appears to have what we want as far as grind quality, we tend to grind every 4-5 days and store the grinds in a vacuum container.  The Gen 2 Ode is single dose and even with the larger after market hopper the grind catcher isn’t very big. 

So…do I use the Gen 2 Ode and just grind 4-5 days worth using multiple single dose grinds, OR do I find something with a bitter hopper?

I see the Baratza Vario W+ but wonder if the grind is consistent enough for French Press. 

Are there any other grinders that have:

Minimal plastic
Flat Burr
Consistent French Press course grind
Ability to grind 4-5 days worth more easily than a single doser

Lastly…we chose French Press because we can avoid plastic touching hot water.  Any other ideas for brewing that avoids plastic?  We are not fans of pour-over. 

Thank you in advance for your advice on this matter.

**I've been getting some lovely messages from international ace's.  As I'm looking for something IRL please kindly only reply/DM if you're in the UK thank you.**

I seem to be one of the older folks around here, but thought I'd give this a try.  As the title says I'm 41 from the UK and would love to find a partner to enjoy life with.  In terms of my aceishness (not a word, but I'm running with it), I'm sex indifferent, but also consider myself kink positive, but I think that's a more private conversation for down the line.  On the flip side I can consider myself to be extremely romantic and love a good cuddle.

I work in tech (like every other Redditor it seems) and that keeps me very busy, but I find myself really lonely in my spare time, hence this post.  In terms of hobbies and interests I'm a huge lover of cinema, bit of a foodie, big reader (big interest in psychology) and I love my sci-fi, oh and coffee is my main vice.  I like to get out in nature especially if there's a cosy pub at the end of the hike.

What else?  I love animals especially dogs but don't have one at the moment unfortunately, I've dealt with my fair share of challenges in my life, but like to think that I've generally remained a positive person i.e. I've become a better more considered person despite said challenges.  

Feel free to say hello, while ultimately I'm looking for a partner I don't consider new friends a consolation prize.

My blood sugar has been 60-66 at its highest. Ketones a steady 0.2. I just ate a Jimmy Dean Delights English Muffin breakfast sandwich which is:
Calories: 270
Fat 8g
Carbs: 31g
Fiber: 2g
Protein: 18g

I also had a coffee with a 1/8th cup of half and half, pure stevia extract and 4 tablespoons of collagen peptides. 

I waited 30 minutes and my blood sugar was 66. Below 70 is considered hypoglycemia. 

Rest of the day my typical eating will be high protein moderate fat with a few mostly fiber sources. 

I’m wondering if I should lose the breakfast sandwiches lean in to ketosis or add more carbs in my meals later on. 

My calories never get over 2000 so I’m going to lose weight either way but I’ve only ever been able to lose weight in ketosis. I’ve never been able to successfully eat carbs and control my caloric intake. 

Is there a benefit to losing weight on balanced macros as opposed to a state of keto especially considering the addition of Retatrutide?

Since I currently work from home in front of the computer all day, I've been feeling pretty tired and unmotivated. So, I recently bought a coffee machine and started drinking black coffee (no milk or sugar).

Fun fact: I had never had coffee before in my life because my grandmother wouldn’t allow it. She always said it was addictive.

Anyway, I started drinking it about two weeks ago, and ever since day one, I’ve noticed some peculiar things.

Every time I drink coffee, I get this intense rush. I feel super energetic, even euphoric, and my thoughts start racing. I even catch myself talking to myself while my brain goes a mile a minute. But at the same time, I feel this weird nervousness, like I’m about to have an accident. Not urgent, but just this strong sensation that my gut suddenly speeds up and I need to go to the bathroom right away.

Sure enough, about 30 minutes after drinking it, I end up going to the bathroom. But when I do, my stool tends to be loose and poorly formed, and it always feels like my body wasn’t ready to go yet, if that makes sense.

After that happens, I usually stop drinking coffee for two days because it throws my digestion off. For example, one day I drank coffee twice, and I went to the bathroom twice, which is not normal for me.

Normally, I go every other day. But when this coffee-chaos cycle starts, then I stop drinking it, I end up going 3 to 4 days without a bowel movement, and that leaves me feeling bloated and uncomfortable.

I’m seriously thinking of quitting coffee. I’m not addicted, and I know I can stop easily. I didn’t even like the taste, to be honest. It’s not something I’d miss, unlike the mint tea my grandmother used to make, which I still drink every day.

I’m 5'8, wear glasses, brown skin, dark hair and eyes. I work as a software developer. I don’t smoke or drink. I’m Christian, and my faith matters to me, but I’m open to anyone who respects that.

I’m a bit introverted at first, but once I’m comfortable I talk a lot, stay loyal, and keep things consistent. I don’t like drama - I prefer slow and steady connections where we can take time to know each other.

Most evenings are simple: coffee, soft music, and a good show. I enjoy small chats about how the day went, sharing songs, laughing at funny scenes, and making little plans we actually do.

I like anime and K-dramas (Naruto and Demon Slayer are favorites), Turkish shows, and story-driven movies. I listen to all kinds of music and love finding new tracks for late-night playlists. I cook simple meals, enjoy hiking, quiet walks, stargazing, and I’d pick a museum or café over a party any day. I used to game a lot, now it’s just Genshin once in a while. I love travel (Japan and Switzerland are dream spots), but I also enjoy calm weekends at home.

I’m looking for someone kind, steady, and emotionally open. Long distance is fine if both try equally. If it feels right, I’m open to closing the gap.

I’ve been interested in penpaling ever since I was a kid. The vastness of regional differences that history and media introduced me to swept me away, making me endlessly fascinated in the many things this world seemed to have out there to be discovered and experienced. That was back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from halfway across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. Since then, I’ve been fortunate enough to have people to exchange with, and I’d like to see if I can find that again.

I’m looking for someone that I first and foremost have a connection with. I want to actually get to know my penpal. Location doesn’t matter as much, as who that person is defines whether I’d like to engage with them or not. I do have a preference for cultural exchange in which we can be introduced to different and new things. But, whether you’re my state or half the world away, it’s you, the person, I want to exchange with.

I'm interested in both a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items, and a digital e-mail exchange. Due to the private nature of penpalling, however, I want us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let’s become familiar with each other to make sure we’re a good fit. I'm open to an e-mail exchange more readily.

So, who am I exactly? And who are you?

I'm 35, male, and live in the US (ET time zone). Thoroughly introverted, but bold and open when the mood strikes and with those who can tap into that aspect of me. I’m designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, hence the lure of elongated methods of communication.

Incremental exchange and a mutual creation is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it’s too fluid to be defined. I sort of have a thing for making connections work that otherwise shouldn't.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young. I’m most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee. I’m always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies. I so probably have more I take for granted.

On the other side, Washington has cashed the Over in 3 of their last 4 outings. By all accounts, today’s final score could land on the moon. I’m on the Over to cash.

It sits just off the path near the Uni Library. It seems like in the last 6 months there has been long lines at different times of the day. I’ve never seen it this busy in years and I don’t know if someone else took over or if they are doing something different. I’m sure it’s a great spot and I’m not saying it doesn’t deserve to be busy, I just can’t ever remember long lines on the regular.

I’ve walked past that spot daily for years but lately it’s been way busier so just looking for the scoop. What’s all the fuss is about? Amazing coffee? Cheap? I heard their Hot chocolate was good but I’ve had it and I’m not sure it’s 20-30min wait good. I appreciate others may disagree and fair enough.

Here’s Something Different,"Most of us have heard the stories about Bitcoin back when it was under a dollar — a time when almost nobody believed it would matter. That era is long gone, and no one expects it to come back. But there’s a new project that’s taking a similar path from the very beginning: **BC2 (Bitcoin II).**

It’s built from the same base code as Bitcoin, using **SHA-256 Proof-of-Work**, the same **21 million limit**, and the same **halving schedule.** No meme branding, no shortcuts — just a clean restart of the original idea. Right now it’s trading around $0.95, roughly the price of a coffee.

What’s interesting is that BC2 isn’t trying to replace Bitcoin or reach its price. It’s not about competing — it’s about revisiting what made the first network special in the first place: fairness, simplicity, and transparency. The community is small but active, with miners, developers and early holders helping shape the network from the ground up.

Everything’s transparent; you can check the explorer and live dashboard at bitcoin-ii.org. It’s already listed on **CoinEx**, so it’s more than just a whitepaper idea.

No one here is pretending this will become the next Bitcoin — that’s not the goal. The point is to rebuild the same foundations, start fresh, and see what can grow when things are still open enough for individuals to make a real impact.

1oauzax,https://www.reddit.com/r/FMD/comments/1oauzax/my_experience_with_prolon/,My Experience With Prolon,"Hello, FMD Reddit page! I just finished 1 course of Dr. Valter Longo's 5-day FMD Prolon. I read Dr. Longo's NYT article about longevity in the Mediterranean and the benefits of a FMD and I've been interested in the research since. For a little background on me, I usually eat healthy-ish and am active when my life allows it. Here was my experience on the diet: 

Day 1: Relatively easy. The lighter caloric load was actually somewhat of a relief since I have a bad habit of snacking/eating lighter some days without paying attention to macros or nutrition and then scrambling to find something at the end of the day. With this, I didn't have anxiety that I wasn't getting enough nutrients. And I found I liked all the food! 

  
Day 2: I was still adjusting to the lighter caloric supply and thus experienced some dips in energy. I had a headache that was going in and out as well. I found that the L-drink was the only thing that helped. I had to really work on conserving my energy, which had a calming effect as it helped me prioritize tasks instead of firing on all cylinders at once.  

  
Day 3: Worst day by far. I almost abandoned at this point. Woke up with a splitting headache that radiated all down my back. Advil didn't help and the L-Drink wasn't really making a dent, so I did a steam facial with essential oils added because it felt like a sinus blockage and that cleared me right up. Took a hot shower and a nap and once the headache subsided, I felt really good. I took it easy for the evening, just expending as little mental and physical energy as possible. It felt like a great chance to give my entire body -- not just my digestive system -- a break. 

Day 4: A breeze. My body had completely gotten used to the fast and I felt calm, cool and collected. My brain felt very clear and meditative. I got a lot of reading, writing and organizing done, and I even went for a short walk in the afternoon. I was effing tired of soup but I was glad that I had stuck with the protocol enough to feel the benefits. 

Day 5: Didn't sleep so well the night before, and was feeling a little restless. I felt like I had gotten used to the amount of food I was eating, but I was actually starting to feel hungry for real and somewhat uncomfortable. I was frequently getting lightheaded if I stood up too fast, and I was craving all of my favorite real foods again. It was difficult to concentrate on tasks that required a ton of brain power, simply because my brain didn't feel fed. However, it was still easy to stick with it the rest of the day. I even had energy to do some Saturday errands and go to a concert that night. Ate my last soup and went to bed hungry af. 

Day 6: Woke up early and very hungry. Had my coffee and slowly ate half a bowl of oatmeal + buckwheat porridge with a tiny bit of yogurt, stewed apples and hemp seeds. I'm going to take eating slowly today as I can already feel my stomach coming to life somewhat painfully. 

Postmortem: I'm glad I tried this protocal/stuck with it just to see what it's about. Day 3 was probably the worst and day 4 was the best. I learned that it is possible to give my digestive system time to rest and it gave me some ideas for days of lighter eating that will hit my macros. I'm looking forward to feeling the benefits of my fast in the days to come as well. 

In terms of physical changes, I've definitely ""de-puffed"" a little and my middle is looking a wee bit trimmer. I wasn't doing it to lose weight, but I didn't lose as much weight as I thought I would -- by the second day I had dropped 2 lbs (probably all water weight) and by the end I had only lost 1 more. I did notice that my the skin around my eyes is a bit baggier/looser, which I didn't expect to happen. Maybe I'm just dehydrated or lost some puff in that area?

I want to try this again, but I'd like to do DIY version just so I can incorporate my own recipes and not actually feel like I'm restricting myself. Looking forward to doing a deep dive on that with this page. While I still remain a fasting skeptic, I do really like the idea of easy-on-the-system diet protocol which accounts for for macros and needed nutrients. As someone who's experimented with a lot of different elimination diets/body resets, I think this is what I've been looking for  a while. 

Sidenote -- I really like the Prolon fasting bars. I've never actually found a snack bar that I like, but I loved this one. The crackers weren't bad (I love a tough ass seeded cracker), and I also really liked drinking all that tea and having a bit of chocolate at the end of the day. I'll probably incorporate some of these things into my everyday life!  

Please let me know if you've had the same experiences or if you have any tips for next time. Thank you for reading and have a great day!",6,1760893565.0,FMD,1,1.0,False

1oaux7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1oaux7j/how_to_lose_weight_without_giving_up_your/,How to Lose Weight Without Giving Up Your Favorite Foods (The Portion Control Guide for Americans),"A lot of people think losing weight means cutting out everything they love. You don’t have to live on salad and chicken breast to see progress. The real key is learning how much of your favorite foods you can enjoy while staying in a calorie deficit.

I used to think i had to quit pizza, burgers, and ice cream to lose weight. The truth is, I just had to eat them differently.

Here’s what worked for me and what I usually tell others:
1. Learn what a real portion looks like,
Most of us grew up in the land of giant portions. A serving of pasta isn’t a full plate. it’s about the size of a baseball. Cheese is two dice. Peanut butter, One spoon, not half the jar. Once I started measuring portions for a week or two, I realized how easy it was to eat double or triple what I thought.

2  Pick your favorite food and make the rest of the meal lighter.
If you want pizza, go for it. Just have one or two slices and pair it with a big salad or some veggies on the side. Same with burgers -go bunless, or skip the fries, or share them. You don’t need to give up flavor; you just balance the calories.

3. Watch out for the extras.
Condiments, dressings, drinks, and sauces add up fast. I didn’t realize how many calories I was drinking in coffee and soda until I switched to zero-calorie versions. Cutting out those 'invisible calories'made a big difference without changing my meals much.

4. Eat slower and actually enjoy your food.
It takes time for your brain to realize you’re full. Slowing down, putting your fork down between bites, and not eating in front of the TV helps you notice when you’ve had enough.
5. Plan for treats

I keep a few hundred calories open most days for something I enjoy - maybe a cookie or a small serving of ice cream. When you plan it, it doesn’t feel like cheating. It keeps you sane and consistent
Losing weight isn’t about perfection. It’s about consistency. You can eat anything you want, just not everything at once. Once you get used to eating proper portions, it stops feeling like a diet and starts feeling like normal life.

I’ve heard from friends my dose is unusually high for the ADHD meds, though google says it’s standard. The antidepressants are a new development, to check for cross-affecting issues before I raise my dose even more. 

The meds help, noticeably, but the main thing I struggle with is consistency. I got one of those weekly pill sorters that somewhat keep me more motivated to take them, but it doesn’t do much and sometimes the pills just marinate there for days up to a week anyway. Being physically at work helps most of the time, since I feel other people’s eyes on me and it helps with social anxiety, gets me out of my head a bit. Plus, at work I have easier access to coffee, which I use to wash down the medication (heart rate is fine, don’t worry). Not taking them seems to have very clear consequences, making me essentially bedbound when I don’t take either the ADHD ones or the antidepressants.

About Me

My ""stats"" are 5'10"" and 170lbs. I'm a highly motivated person, constantly striving for improvement and challenging my own beliefs. I've built a life I'm proud of through my work as a chemical operator, a career that gives me a good living and the flexibility to stay in touch throughout the day. When I'm not at work, I love running, going to the gym regularly, and playing with my pit/lab mix named Strider (yes, as in LOTR).

I'm a bit of a nerd, so fantasy is a huge thing for me—from Lord of the Rings movies to the annual Harry Potter marathon around the holidays. I play PC games with my friends, I visit the local renaissance fair and try to plan a costume, so it would be cool if we could bond over that! I also love to travel, read history books, and try new restaurant/coffee shops, hanging with friends, and music festivals.

What I'm Looking For

I think fundamentally, even if we don't share the exact same hobbies, having the same goals and a similar future outlook is most important. I'm looking for a partner to share in the small, intimate moments that make a relationship special:

\- Weekend cuddles and lazy mornings

\- Evening coffee shop reading dates

\- Random road trips and hitting the gym together

\- Holding hands at the farmer’s market or snuggling in a hammock

I'm an inquisitive person, so I tend to ask a lot of questions. I don't mind calling whenever you're comfortable because conversations typically flow better that way for me.

I’m open to long-distance relationships (in the US only), but my ultimate goal is for us to eventually move in together. Relocation to me is ideal.

If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you! I'll probably only respond if your open to sharing a pic within the first message or two so we can see if the attraction is mutual, i do have preferences for partners who have a thin/petite build or lean towards the athletic/fit side and ideally over 25.

1oauuca,https://www.reddit.com/r/Step2/comments/1oauuca/my_step_2_250_without_step_1_experience/,My Step 2 250+ without Step 1 experience,"I started my preparation **last December** 2024 from the scratch. My baseline was taking more than *10m* just to solve one Uworld question to solving about *15* questions or more in *10m.* My exam was on early September .

# Index :

1. **Resources.**
2. **Test day.**
3. **Test experience.**
4. **Final thoughts.**

# 1. Resources :

1.The **inner circle notes** are ***Golddd*** along with the **JAnki deck** ( the earlier version). I am really  grateful to the person who wrote and made them.

2. **JAnki deck** is a great tool to revise Uworld ( don't use it before the first pass of Uworld).

3.**Uworld** : Don't bother doing more than two passes and they have to be not too close in timing.

4.**Amboss** :  If you really have a huge knowledge gap then go for it. it tests nearly the same concepts of Uworld but from a different angle and this angle is usually omitted in Uworld. Another advantage of doing amboss  is that a lot of **silly and low yield questions** are covered in amboss, I got literally a similar concept as a question from amboss but guess what? I chose the wrong answer  because I didn't give it much importance and it was in my early study period.

5.**CMS forms** : Very important. do them near the end of the preparation and be aware of outdated guidelines.

6.**NBMEs** : Do them as much as you can, ***3 or 4  times*** even more if you can.  I think the most representative ones  of the exam contents  are ***13 14 15***. Do the ***8th*** form as the final one because it contains questions from the 9th and 10th form.  I had literally a question from the 8th form that is repeated word by word only the options were different.

7.**The free 120s**: do them all even the old ones.  Do The new interactive version  **3-2w** before  the exam. it is really similar to the real deal in terms of question styling and wording. It can predict if you will struggle in it.

8. **First Aid Step 1 book** : the only chapters you will definitely need are **Microbiology** and **Public health.**

# 2. Test day :

**Before the test preparations :** I stopped hitting the gym for a whole week before the exam ( I do high intensity workout) and  stopped  studying completely 2 days before the exam, not even reviewing in mind, just full rest.

**On the test day :** I woke up at 5.30 am had a small breakfast then had another one at 7.00 am ( eggs and tuna). Arrived at the test Centre at 8.00 am but had to wait till 8.45 to let us in.

I got severe headaches when I was  solving the NBMEs, so as a prophylaxis I took **Panadol extra** ( it contains caffeine so at the same time I somehow managed the no coffee problem) 2 tablets an hour before the exam, two after the 3rd block, one after the 6th.Take **BCAA ( amino acids)** sachets with you. I drunk one after the 4th block and it gave me an energy boost.

During the exam I felt like I was in a **LIMBO**, and ***9 hours*** passed in a glimpse. After the exam i was laughing like I was high and then suddenly my energy levels dropped drastically . I couldn't sleep the night because of the anxiety and had nightmares for 3 days.

# 3. Test experience :

My form was mainly heavy in ***Cardiology , Genecology and Urology .*** 

All my blocks started with really long (15 to 20 lines, I don't mean the *HOPI* ones) and hard questions so I directly was skipping the first 5qs and started immediately from the end of the block. The questions at the end were way too easy and direct, some of them were 3 lines max.

My form was really heavy in ***Ethics***, Quality improvement and Patient safety, **5-6** per Block. They were weird and unusual. I think the only thing that really helped me in solving those questions is by taking the outline of the usmle and feed  it to chatgpt and gemini. I asked them to explain every topic in detail and to give me sample questions. It was Like nothing came from amboss or Uworld.

I had around ***9 Biostatistics*** questions , ***6*** of them were ***abstracts*** questions. They were direct and simple nothing complicated. I had no drug ads.

In every block there were some *questions*, the only way to solve them was to possess the question writer to know why the hell they would write such one.

**My break strategy** was taking one after each block even if it was just for 3 minutes.

**My solving strategy** was doing the questions as fast as possible. First I  read the last sentence to know what the question is asking then immediately scan it very quickly after that I  should have an answer in my mind so I go searching for it. If I  don't find it I skip the question. This process takes ***40s max***. At the end of each block I had ***10m*** left so I had  the chance to revisit every question. I found out I did some mistakes and corrected them.

# 4. Final thoughts :

You have to study everything literally everything. According to previous write ups , things like screening, vaccination ( I spent the last week memorizing the whole ***CDC*** table with its notes) and systems like GIT and Pulmonary had the highest number of questions, But this was not the case for me. When I was  deciding which systems I should give more Wight in my studies and revisions, I made a mistake of relying on the old  ***""Table 1: Step 2 CK System Specifications "".*** Those change frequently and they are  definitely not reliable.  Like just before 2 months of my exam, the renal& reproductive system percentage was only *3-6%* now its *7-13 %.*

The exam is **doable** if you study very well for it. It had an equal distribution of easy, medium, hard  questions with some unsolvable ones . Up to a certain point it is dependent on your knowledge after that it's more about strategic thinking, problem solving skills and most importantly **LUCK.**

The only thing I regret is not **treating every question with equal importance**. In the exam, I gave more attention to the long and difficult questions and I didn't **spend** enough time on the short and easy ones **for fear** of overthinking them. I believe that was my main pitfall for not crossing **260**. Of all the questions I remembered, nearly **40**, only **seven** of them were wrong. I think I managed to answer the experimental ones correctly, and most of my mistakes were **on the scored questions.**

Regarding **Step 1** stuff, I didn’t encounter any . No questions were asked about the pathophysiology , enzymes , risk factors …etc

I didn’t mean that I don’t have anything for her at all but that unfortunately after I left for work and had a bad day, didn’t send her any message she believed that I don’t have anything for her. Coming me later after work with flowers already was not working. Never mind presents with delay next day.

It was her worst anniversary our 3rd. I am 37 she is now 39. I am Latvian she is German and we speak in English. I don’t really remember that we talk this out completely. But the message was clear, with this morning speech that I don’t have anything for her wasn’t right thing to say.  Ok! Living on!

She works a lot, way too much, she also just change her job, so a lot of stress work related. I listen to everything sometimes it’s little hard to keep up but I listen. Sometimes I don’t have anything to say or I already said some opinion about this topic, so I don’t want to keep repeating myself about the same situation just from different angle.

Anyway, won’t let you wait long for any next “fukup” It’s her birthday 51 days later, obviously I won’t make same mistake and I was prepared. Gift her present in the morning. Everything ok with that. I want to add that we both being sick at the moment also. Sleep in different rooms coz I got little but harder version of the virus and taking some antibiotics. We went out for the morning coffee and I went to bed straight after. She ask me then later see me in the bed. Are you going to sleep? And I said yes. “ in my head I just took some meds and I will just rest a little” , but I wasn’t ready for her to say that she will plan a day without me. I simply was upset, it’s her birthday and she decided to cut me out. I went and said what you mean? Plan the day without me? And she said yes if you still sick and want to sleep do that. I want to do something, it’s my birthday. So yeah I went back to bed. 08:30 in the morning. Then she start cleaning the flat and I was just sleeping all day stupidly people come in and I just didn’t bother.

Later on in the evening when she came back I couldn’t help myself to make it worst. I wanted to find out what is exactly happening. In my stupid head this didn’t fit together, it’s your birthday and you want to plan day without me, so I don’t want to spoil your birthday. But still for me it’s not nice thing to hear that you want to cut me out. She said I am like this and I said like this. I had an all chances to help anyway to spend day with her, but I was sleeping so it’s my problem. So yeah happy birthday  to her, 39 and the worst one yet coz of me.

I try to make it up through nice gestures and making coffees, cleaning all morning kitchen myself and in 2 days I managed to come close to the peace, but this morning again. Now wish I never offer myself to drive her and her daughter to church. Really more than half of our arguments and miss communication we had in the car. For some reason after the junction after she raise the hand and told me just a little bit more straight “what I didn’t really hear “ I went straight for the stop, I know that the church is still about 250-  300m away she was confused why I want to stop and I explain that her hand little bit misdirected me, then she said that I “always” having some problems on the road and don’t listen to me.

Still that “always” word was a slap for me, and after she came back from the church she saw that my mood has changed. She was already over it, but I start talk about it and it led to complete different topics, she said that we never had a good conversation, only good in bed. I said that I am not her ex husband who you can talk about work and flirt daily 30-40min. Yes I said flirt, then I corrected myself that I heard her saying compliments to him. Obviously not the same thing and yes it was water already spilled big time. I love her, and I don’t want to lose her but I don’t know what to do next or how to fix this….

1oauk99,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1oauk99/taking_a_break_from_dating_apps/,Taking a break from dating apps,"So I (23F) have only been in two relationships in the past two years. My last one ended in July after just two months, but it hit harder than I expected because I had real feelings for him. He ended it after saying he might be on the asexuality spectrum — and then added that he “just didn’t care about the relationship anymore.” Yeah… that one stung. Up until then, I genuinely thought we were happy. We’d explore new places, do Legos together, and watch movies all the time. He was so thoughtful and intentional that I really believed it was something solid.

After that breakup, I threw myself into my book club and started meeting new friends. During a girls’ night I hosted, I was venting about how much I missed him, and my friends basically staged a mini intervention. Their take was, “You could meet someone just like him — maybe even better — just as easily.” So, against my better judgment, I redownloaded the apps.

Over the next couple of months, I went on a few good (and not-so-good) dates with guys between 23 and 27. Two didn’t have licenses or cars. One was super nice but I just didn’t feel any romantic spark.

Then came the last guy — the one I swore would be my “final attempt” before taking a break. He was 27, a preschool teacher, and had published two books, which honestly impressed me. Our first date was ice cream and a three-hour conversation, the second was an impromptu walk downtown, the third a coffee festival, and the fourth was the movies. On paper it sounds sweet, but the whole thing started to feel more like a friendship than romance.

I’m all for being independent — I don’t expect anyone to pay for me — but I noticed I was doing a lot. I paid for my own ticket at the movies, my own coffee on the walk, and once I found out he didn’t have a car or license, I started picking him up and paying for parking. Between our second and third date, I also completely changed my hair (from braids to straight), and he didn’t say a word about it. Not one.

As a safety precaution, I usually look people up before I get too far into dating them. I found his Twitter easily and saw he had tweeted about me a couple of times. It wasn’t anything outrageous, but it felt off. After talking it over with my friends, I knew it was time to cut it loose. I planned to end things after our fourth date, but he hopped out of my car so fast I didn’t get the chance. On the drive home, I decided it’d feel too cold to text, so I FaceTimed him and told him how I felt. He agreed that he didn’t feel a romantic connection either.

At the end of the day, I really do want a long-term relationship where we both care for each other and grow together — but for now, I’m officially logging off the apps. It makes me sad sometimes, because I know how capable I am of loving someone deeply. Both of my exes told me I’m a good person and deserving of love.

1oaujh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1oaujh3/affected_through_you/,affected through you,"no scientific knowledge can discover what friendship is. one can try to think about what it means, but there is no explicit structure that tells us what friendship is. the meaning of friendship is something that cannot be explained; it can only be thought. you can try to describe it, and in doing so, you come closer to the experience, and then it seems to take on that meaning... but the approach is inexhaustible, because you can always continue it. 

one cannot say that friendship has been defined once and for all, that’s why thought never ends, and that’s why the meaning of life is never a possession. thus, thinking is a continuous approach to the meaning of the important things.

when i think that “i’m thinking of you,” i realize that it’s not that i think of you, but that you’re always there, like a kind, deep-rooted presence; hundreds of conversations shape my inner dialogue today, without my being aware that your voice, your words, and our encounters are now the structure of my thought, of my present. 

they define me in a silent, and playful way: these encounters always slip away, since sometimes i find myself silently conversing with you, even after days of not knowing about each other.

passivity and passion are born from the same root: from passing through, from allowing oneself to be affected; from the wound, which can only happen when you are open, when you are generous and give yourself. you don’t give your time, you don’t “manage” your time, but you give yourself.

and i think of the infinity of hours we’ve given each other. not with caresses, nor with kisses, but through pure attention, with care, with thought, with the passion of words and of life itself: any ordinary afternoon could be the most interesting adventure of my week, going to any shop or having a coffee, because giving myself to you has been a transcendental experience from the very beginning, because from the mundane a deep bond was created—one that has transcended me, that has passed through me, and that has transformed me; and it keeps transforming me, changing me every day, thinking of the same affection.

i keep seeing myself making mistakes, playing chess with your shadow. avoiding you, getting angry at your reactions, at your coldness in certain moments, at myself for having you so present, without wanting to. because the affection i feel, with you as its channel, surpasses expectations, surpasses social conventions, even imaginable futures. 

futures that may never materialize; those that desire makes and unmakes continuously, so intensely that it hurts, and only after silence is reconciliation possible. 

to remember again that it is desire, and that the marrow of this desire has never ceased to be the surprise, the gratitude, and the grace of having met you.",4,1760892525.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,0.84,False

1oauikb,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverhousing/comments/1oauikb/any_advice_sorry_for_the_long_post/,Any advice? ( Sorry for the long post),"Back in July 2022, my sister and I moved into a suite in Vancouver from overseas. The place was completely empty when we got it. Our written lease said the rent was 2100 total and that it included utilities. It didn’t mention Wi-Fi or cable anywhere in the contract.

After we signed, the landlady told us not to worry about setting up Wi-Fi or cable because it would be too much trouble. She said she would handle it herself and just charge us 50 each per month for it. We agreed verbally, thinking it was just for convenience. On the contract, she actually checked the boxes showing Wi-Fi and cable as included, but she never changed the rent amount from 2100. She was supposed to update the price if she wanted to legally charge extra, but she didn’t. So legally, the rent stayed at 2100 and included everything, even though that wasn’t her intention.

My sister and I paid 1100 each, which made 2200 total. Over time, the landlady brought in furniture for us, like a dining table with six chairs, a recliner couch, coffee tables, and kitchenware. My sister and I each bought our own beds.

In December 2024, my sister moved out. The landlady kept her damage deposit, saying it would cover two weeks while the room was empty before she found a new tenant. My sister agreed verbally, so there wasn’t an argument about it. Two weeks later, someone new moved into the room.

I kept paying 1100, and the new roommate paid the same, so the landlady was still collecting 2200 total every month. She never ended the original lease, never wrote a new one, and never had me sign anything new. The only contract I’ve ever signed is the original one from July 2022.

When my sister moved out, the room was never subleased under me. I never signed a single contract for any of the tenants who came after her. The landlady handled everything herself and signed those contracts under her own name, like they were completely new tenancies.

Then, in early September 2025, she told me that since I was the only one left on the original contract, I was now responsible for the full 2100. That was the first time she ever said that to me. I started looking into my tenancy rights and learned that she can’t raise rent without giving three months’ written notice and that it has to stay within the legal yearly limit.

When I told her that, she argued that since I was the last person on the lease, she could raise my rent however she wanted. She said she was increasing my rent from 1100 to 1225. Her reason was that she had to lower the other room’s rent from 1100 to 975 because no one wanted to rent it at that price, so she said my rent needed to go up to “compensate” for the loss.

Even though she was still waiting for me to agree, she didn’t wait for a yes or a signed amendment. She just went ahead and listed the room for 975 on her own and started charging me the higher amount. A few days ago, she gave me a new amendment, saying it was to “clarify everything we had already discussed” since I supposedly wasn’t 100 percent clear before. That amendment also included a line saying that starting in February 2026, she would begin charging me for utilities and would also be increasing those utility rates from that point onward. This is despite the original contract already stating that utilities were included in the rent.

She told me I should be happy she only raised it by 125 because she could have lowered the other tenant’s rent even more and made me cover a bigger share. I paid the extra 125 in October, covering the period from September 15 to October 15, but a few days later, she came by and said I had paid a month early. Then she told me that in November, I should go back to paying 1100 since I had already paid the increase early.

Now she’s saying that if my current roommate moves out, I’ll be the one responsible for finding a new tenant, even though I never agreed to that and have never signed anything that says I’m responsible for subleasing or managing tenants.

The bed my sister left behind is still there. The landlady offered to buy it, and I told her I’d have to ask my sister first. We weren’t on speaking terms at the time, so I never brought it up again. My sister didn’t care about getting paid for it anyway.

At this point, I just want to move out. She’s been kind in some ways, but this whole situation is a mess. I’ve been overpaying for years, and she keeps adding new charges that were never agreed to in writing. I want to figure out how to get compensated for what I’ve already overpaid while keeping things as calm as possible. Since I can’t really afford a lawyer 

Right now, I’m trying to find a place where I can live alone, preferably a small studio or one-bedroom for around 1200 or less. I have a cat, so it has to be pet friendly. If anyone knows good rental sites, safe neighborhoods, or verified listings in Vancouver, please share them.

**Memory Transcryption Subject: Asri Dalmali, Indonesian Minister of Space Operations**

*Date \[UTC+8\]: October 12, 2139*

Things are looking up, up in the space, no interruptions, no worker strikes, and all the previous conflicts with Russia, China, and Mainland SEA countries over asteroid ownerships were resolved with the yesterdays agreement in Beijing.

With our agreement, we have now a huge industrial opportunity with millions of tons of iron and manganese deposits on a few M-type asteroids, and they will be massively important for our space construction ambitions, that for these merits, could not be further than a regular agreement. Many countries all across the world, small and large, possess the capability to mine space rocks into spaceships, or more commonly, large-scale construction and as a replacement of plastics.

I returned to Nusantara overnight, and here I am, sipping my fresh coffee in this beautiful morning, looking down on the city from my residence on the hill overlooking the Capitol, free from any stress apart from the heat in the terrace outside, though a fan is still the most usual attempt to solve such a problem outside.

There is plenty of projects we have discussed with the rest of the ministry and the president, and we have mostly agreed on boosting the construction of the Sukarno Space Telescope Network before anything else, it being a bunch of lenses orbiting the sun in a lonely, tilted orbit near the Oort cloud, far away from any other object or obstruction in the system. Many countries are lined up to use the already existing optic infrastructure, which already presents a little blurry but otherwise a pretty accurate image so far.

It has been confirmed for the last 50 years that there were several planets out there with signs of life, and with a massive telescope, we can detect even more exoplanets with much more certain results of potential habitability, or observe known ones for further information. I was absolutely astonished when we had the first visual photo of the Gliese 832c 16 light years away, with its faint turqoise strip standing on it's middle, standing proud, without a doubt, as the closest habitable place beyond our planet.

I wondered what kind of lifeforms are prevalent in there. Would they have such infuriating mosquito equivalent shitbugs like ours? Maybe there really is some heavenly lands over there, with as beautiful forest-esque structures and landscape like ours, without any natural vectors, no venomous animals, and maybe without the terrible humid hot feeling in the twilights whenever I go out, even the 20 seconds of walk from my houses door to the street where my car is parked is like a hell.

I said to myself; *why the hell this townhouse wasn't built like a garage, like any other civilized houses and flats around? I really should've entered politics earlier.*

Well, whatevers out there, its gotta be truly alien, surely. No animals, no plants, no forests, no nothing that could be on Earth. And without a doubt, it will be the most wonderful thing an eye could ever see.

While some things change, like the structure of this very council, some things never do, and that is our constant bickering over nothing. Sometimes, we manage to get a motion into motion, other times we just can't. This is one of those days where we're still left undecided on which region we must establish more fusion reactors in, the topic that has been delayed for the last few sessions.

""Germany, with our massive industry and construction projects, desperately needs extra energy infrastructure to prevent any outages from expansion and adoption of more energy-intensive technologies such as the ever-increasing number of holographic devices in all households."" one of the two German delegates expressed.

""You already have more than enough number of reactors, especially after your reversal of the anti-nuclear policies in 2083. The nuclear reactors in France are on the end of their lifespan with their incredibly obsolete technology, and are in dire need of replacement. Some of them weren't build to withstand to this day, and they're still weak against any potential cyber-attacks despite the patches."" the French secretary delegate commented.

""We are the mainland Europe's space hub, and a frontier to the East Mediterranean and Turkey, yet we don't even have any proper reactor other than a few local fusion SMR's, which are barely enough for their respective cities."" responded the single Greek delegate, and the Bulgarian, North Macedonian, and Croatian delegates whose countries would make use of investments closer to them and weren't among the potential candidates anyways approved him.

""I would like to remind you of our letter sent by the vast majority to the Greece in 2134 to cease energy, Saturnian gasses and mineral imports from Turkey, Kazakhstan, and Russia, or face sanctions. Under these sanctions as a state that has not taken it seriously, you are not eligible for any meaningful investments from EU funds. And it is already known that tectonic geology in almost all of Greece is unsuitable for a major reactor complex."" The Latvian delegate said it, interrupting the Irish delegate that was about to say the same. ""Latvia and the broader Baltic countries has not imported any outside energy despite the shortcomings of our economy. We would be honored to accept a most well-deserved fusion and electrical infrastructure investment that would free up the European Grid.""

All delegates presented their cases to the rest of the council, which weren't supported by one another. After about 10 minutes, tens of formal proposal letters being sent by at least 3 delegates and a team of academics, data analyzers and researchers, it was pretty clear that this council wasn't going to get it done the third time, which meant one thing.

""The alloted time for the delegates presentations are over, and there hasn't been strong candidates established for there to be a fair vote, therefore as the president of the Council, I have the authority to make the final decision to put the 16th proposal of today into effect, which would establish 10 major fusion reactors on the designated cities of Romania, alongside 3 other reactor constructions in Hungary and 2 in Bulgaria. If you have any objections you may place a vote to veto.""

Most delegates didn't veto anyways, because over 50% veto votes would just mean complete cancellation of the investment we, as Europe, needed. Business in the EU usually runs that way anyways, the country in power of the council takes as much advantage of it as possible, through such undecided delegates that send more than 5 proposals which is the maximum that could be evaluated in a day. That was also why it was difficult to organize our nations to modernize ESA into a proper space agency, instead of having many mercenary forces and smaller space corporations and that ""represent"", and leech off of Europe up in the void. Many of these mining establishments have formed a cartel of Jovian hydrogen and Saturnian helium-3, that we have no other choice but to rely on.

Life is unfair, so make sure you aren't the one it's being unfair *to*.

*Date \[UTC\]: October 16, 2139*

The ""glorious"" view of the plateau was so fucking boring from the depths of Valles Marineris, in the New Bujumbura Base. Our national focus on space habitation was paying off great, and this base was one of the most active on Mars, with more than 15,000 active personnel. We didn't think we would realistically ever achieve FTL, and even if we did, having access to the almost endless resources of the bountiful void would always provide an advantage.

Though I much preferred working on Earth, the pay here is as glorious as the people claimed the view is. Though I've never been the one to appreciate landscapes, unlike everyone sitting around, who looked outside in awe, even the ones who worked for years here. I'll probably work for 5 more years until I and my husband retire early, and move to a nice, small but elegant villa back in Uganda, near my mothers tribes village, which is honestly prettier, and had everything I need. He is still not up to it, saying that the village life is no longer the same, and he'd like a place that remained pure and natural instead.

This base I had been working around for the last 3 years was the greatest product of our long-ridiculed and criticized space program, starting right after the Satellite Wars, which we thankfully had no part in, therefore only had to fend off a few rogue cyber-attacks, which was still fairly challenging for a newly developing bunch of formerly failed states.

It still was seen as completely unnecessary for us to aim for the stars by the general public up until we emerged as an actually industrialized, prosperous nation among the greatest ones in this world this century, if we didn't start right back then, we wouldn't be at where we are now, though it was also thanks to a collaboration of many other nations and space programs of the world, like India, Russia, Turkey, Indonesia, and The Joint, the South American space program, that this base was a very successful center of astrophysical and chemical research, geologic evaluation, and also a vast databank. Many other nations wanted to expand their Martian operations around New Bujumbura, which, nowadays, was more like a city with absurd air pollution outside rather than a space base.

As my alloted time for the lunch break is over, I walked out of the domed plaza, into the tunnel leading to the hydroponics building. On the tunnel, I met up with Joshua, the chief of biological research, my ongoing research on genetic modification of plants to adapt better into Martian conditions put me under him, though our workplace manners were more casual than most.

""Good sol, sir"" I said, walking alongside him to our respective workspaces.

""Hello Mrs. Lela, nice to meet you. How are your potatos doing?""

""Better than all of them, though not a high bar to clear. They are resistant to changes, either results not applying or resulting in plants dying, or some other unintended effect. Fed a poor rat a potato paste straight out of Martian soil I was certain it was nothing poisonous. The rat got explosive diarrhea, then died. Fuck me.""

""No inappropriate suggestions in the workplace, please."" He said, in a sarcastic tone.

""Can't you just get replaced like the rest of your Lay-ti-necks co-workers, thought you completely shifted your focus on FTL comms research here?""

""No need to hit me with the second-worst racial slur of the Americas just because I was messing around, alright? That would be a pretty bad farewell if I am actually going back, which I really might. *El Conjunto* really is turning off all budgets on everything except for FTL research. If we are going to try out whatever the Turks or the Americans are doing, I'd say it is pretty late for this.""

""Yeah, at least your guys are replacing personnel with others. The only Turks remaining here for the last 2 years are in Döner and Pide restaurants up in the market section.""*..damn, a big lunch break and still feeling the hunger of my ancestors as i remind myself of that part of the market section..*

""Can't blame them, they seem to have no resources to spare for anything really. They found themselves in a conflict with Persians and other Kurds on top of their audacity to try to compete with China and USA in space research. They are literally destroying their own country with strip mines and mineral processing plants they can barely defend.""

""Yeah, like you were pampering your pretty Amazon trees and definitely not trampling them over for some shitass plantations. I wonder why there are 3 exoplanets predicted to be more habitable than current Earth for human life"" I said, waving my hand as goodbye before retreating into my lab.

I thought of the same headline I saw a few days ago, 3 exoplanets found together on the far edge of Orion Arm predicted to host conditions more suitable to human life than our very own cradle, the only heaven we ever knew.

*Maybe the humankind really could build an FTL engine in our lifetimes. Maybe we'll reach there, and maybe we'll settle in a small, prefabricated house in the alien planets as explorers instead, just like he fantasizes to do.*

**Memory Transcryption Subject: Fatih Rıza Ceylan, Turkish Head of Space Defence**

*Date \[UTC+2\]: October 29, 2139*

Here I am, in this bullet train between the capital city Ankara, and its greatest industrial powerhouse Antalya, with a beautiful view of the prairies of the rural Konya, the Turkish agricultural heartland and one of the last major places left without mass industrialization and deep strip mines that scar the surface of the vast Anatolia. It isn't like we have much of a choice, the progress progresses beyond control and it is common knowledge that unlimited progress is the only thing that can ever save the Noocratic Republic of Turkey from its demise.

The discovery of habitable planets in the 2090's has deeply impacted the course of the newly-founded Noocracy. Our fathers knew, the Turkish nation missed the age of exploration and that cost us our trade routes and our hegemony over the West and the East. We missed the age of industrialization and that cost us our whole empire apart from this tiny Anatolia and a few other spare land.

We can not afford to repeat the same mistake the third time, and we shall be the pioneers of the space age no matter what, in order to preserve our very existence, and to realize it, people including me have been working for 60 hours a week to make a living, and carved up any forest, hill, lake, anything that had traces of raw materials, and are actively betraying the very sentences of our previous republics march; *""Don't give up on this heavenly homeland, even if it means receiving the worlds"".*

I looked inside my bag in case I forgot anything, but not really. A space forces uniform for my little nephew, my old holo-phone for my dad, and swim shorts in case I feel like submerging myself in the waters of the Mediterranean. Oh I missed the experience a lot, and man I really missed the whole city in general.

It used to be a hub for broke tourists and rarely some roman history lovers, which still kind of is, but the city has diversified its economy during the years of civil war as the municipality took over control. It used to be a symbol of infrastructural failure of the former republic with no rail connection to the outside world, and only having a slow light rail line that served its citizens.

My fathers and grandfathers generation has transformed it into the pride of the country and the envy of the world, with tens of metro and interurban lines branching out to all parts of the province. Their understanding of logistics was what led to the re-formation of the conventional HSR network, which was made into the country's jugular artery after a group of Kemalist municipalities fought off the Islamist Fundamentalists, and took over control in the impoverished Ankara and the NATO-occupied Istanbul, ending the 5 decades old civil war in 2080.

The insides were first drowned in darkness, then showered with almost-daylight as we entered into a tunnel penetrating the once-impassable Taurus Mountains, going at 500km/h against all odds. I thought of my schedule. Today is the Republic's Day, the same joyful day for the last 2 centuries, so it was quite a rush from the rebuilt Anıtkabir, to public speeches, openings, school visits, routine meetings and assignments, and now I am heading to my hometown for another nights festival and concert.

Then there's the Persian-backed Kurdish insurgents that are raiding our southeastern cities after a major airbase that suppressed any violence in the region was struck down. If it was up to me, I would strike down all of their lairs up in the mountains and neo feudal city-states down in the ruins of Iraq with Tungsten Rods from space, but they've been decreed as a WMD in the last 40 years, therefore we will be outcasted even further than we are, and be condemned for genocide, as if these bandits are not slaughtering whoever speaks a word of Turkish there.

*Just another reason why, we must save ourselves from this damned Earth. No one cares if a Turk dies, but everyone will speak against us if we dare to retaliate. The human civilization is corrupt, and we must set ourselves free from it, by any means necessary.*

I eventually fell for my usual fantasies of abandonment of Earth, and colonization of other, greater planets, all for us to thrive in, as I looked out of the window, showing me the short yet broad and beautiful skyline of Antalya, the pearl of the Mediterranean, as we got out of the tunnel. This train ride, even if for a single evening hour surrounded by a few civil agents, was a fresh breath amongst all that.

Here’s Something Different,"Most of us have heard the stories about Bitcoin back when it was under a dollar — a time when almost nobody believed it would matter. That era is long gone, and no one expects it to come back. But there’s a new project that’s taking a similar path from the very beginning: **BC2 (Bitcoin II)**.

It’s built from the same base code as Bitcoin, using **SHA-256 Proof-of-Work**, the same **21 million limit**, and the same **halving schedule**. No meme branding, no shortcuts — just a clean restart of the original idea. Right now it’s trading around **$0.95**, roughly the price of a coffee.

What’s interesting is that BC2 isn’t trying to replace Bitcoin or reach its price. It’s not about competing — it’s about revisiting what made the first network special in the first place: fairness, simplicity, and transparency. The community is small but active, with miners, developers and early holders helping shape the network from the ground up.

Everything’s transparent; you can check the explorer and live dashboard at [bitcoin-ii.org](https://bitcoin-ii.org). It’s already listed on **CoinEx**, so it’s more than just a whitepaper idea.

No one here is pretending this will become the next Bitcoin — that’s not the goal. The point is to rebuild the same foundations, start fresh, and see what can grow when things are still open enough for individuals to make a real impact.

So, I have been suffering from recurrent utis and vaginal infections since January this year. I got E.coli in uti report and streptococcus agaitae in vaginal swab report. 

I went to the gynac every month and they gave me antibiotics but nothing seemed to help since the infection would clear up and then come back after my periods. 

By June, I suspected it could be a pad issue and switched to different cotton pads and after a lot of trial and error, one brand worked for me and I no longer get a full blown infection after using it. 

But the infection didn't go away completely but it's manageable since its no longer itchy, also my partner and I switched to non-latex condoms and I take cranberry Dmannouse tablet after sex and that has also helped in reducing the infection.

The weirdest thing that has helped me the most and this may sound crazy is a pee device. My problem has always been that whenever I peed, some of it would touch the vagina (sounds gross), I would l notice whitish discharge in the vagina which was itchy.

 I read somewhere that when you pee, it relaxes your vaginal muscles or smth and thus the infection comes out. It was really frustrating to pee and find white itchy discharge everytime so I started looking for ways my left-over pee wouldn't irritate the vagina and I found a pee device online.

It looks like a d**k but it worked for me. It solved the issue of pee irritating the vagina and then it also reduced the infection entirely.

Other than this, I take NAC and probiotics daily (not recommended ask your doctor) and I take crannD after sex. But what's really bothering me right now is that the infection isn't completely gone.

I notice the same whitish itchy discharge when I : 
1. Drink tea or coffee with milk
2. Eat sugary things like sweets or Sundaes 
3. Wear underwear. This may sound silly but since March I couldn't wear an underwear because it would irritate my skin and increased uti and vag infections.

 I switched to cotton shorts underneath skirts and pants. It's not entirely comfortable but what else can I do? 

Can anyone help me in understanding how can these infections go away entirely?

one cannot say that friendship has been defined once and for all, that’s why thought never ends, and that’s why the meaning of life is never a possession. thus, thinking is a continuous approach to the meaning of the important things.

when i think that “i’m thinking of you,” i realize that it’s not that i think of you, but that you’re always there, like a kind, deep-rooted presence; hundreds of conversations shape my inner dialogue today, without my being aware that your voice, your words, and our encounters are now the structure of my thought, of my present. 

they define me in a silent, and playful way: these encounters always slip away, since sometimes i find myself silently conversing with you, even after days of not knowing about each other.

passivity and passion are born from the same root: from passing through, from allowing oneself to be affected; from the wound, which can only happen when you are open, when you are generous and give yourself. you don’t give your time, you don’t “manage” your time, but you give yourself.

and i think of the infinity of hours we’ve given each other. not with caresses, nor with kisses, but through pure attention, with care, with thought, with the passion of words and of life itself: any ordinary afternoon could be the most interesting adventure of my week, going to any shop or having a coffee, because giving myself to you has been a transcendental experience from the very beginning, because from the mundane a deep bond was created—one that has transcended me, that has passed through me, and that has transformed me; and it keeps transforming me, changing me every day, thinking of the same affection.

i keep seeing myself making mistakes, playing chess with your shadow. avoiding you, getting angry at your reactions, at your coldness in certain moments, at myself for having you so present, without wanting to. because the affection i feel, with you as its channel, surpasses expectations, surpasses social conventions, even imaginable futures. 

futures that may never materialize; those that desire makes and unmakes continuously, so intensely that it hurts, and only after silence is reconciliation possible.

- 18g in of ""Trinci since 1939"" coffee beans
- WDT tool
- Distributor Tamper
- Metallic puck screen
- 36g out with 8 seconds of pre-infusion

Coffee Machine: breville/sage Bambino plus

I have the df54 at fine level of 8??

1oau28w,https://www.reddit.com/r/TAZCirclejerk/comments/1oau28w/shmecap_drivethrus/,Shmecap: Drive-Thrus,"What's up jerkers, my laptop gave it up after a few months of the ""well it works if you get the charger cable at *exactly* the right angle,"" but I'm back with a new laptop because nothing is more important to me than posting. This one has a cool feature where the touchpad has a number pad that you can toggle on and off, so you're not limited to just the number keys if you do a spreadsheet! 

Drive-thrus! This is a 2018 shmepisode. Got a lot of experience with this one, I worked in the Starbucks mines for seven years, drive-thru stores for 5 of em, and I have seen every type of antisocial behavior you can imagine. Drinking a hard lemonade as I hand your coffee into your vehicle, with multiple empties visible? Giving your name as ""Ben Dover"" and ordering ""two gay cocks, hehehe, I mean, cake pops?"" Asking if I'm ""a transgender"" and how long I've been one? Having your actual dick and balls out? Getting so irate at the lid popping off that you hurl the 190-degree drink back at us? Calling the store to say that you didn't get whipped cream so you were coming back with a gun? Look, there's a reason I'm not in the business anymore. I became a 911 operator because walking someone through CPR on their brother is less stressful. 

(I'm gonna go ahead and say that I doubt Traveresa will have anything particular to say about the etiquette of drink driving through the Starbucks patio fence at 9:24pm or threatening people's lives if the store has to close early. For the record: both of those are considered ""rude"" and you shouldn't do them.)

* Travis, hand cupped over his mouth to simulate a speaker: ""Uhhhghgh, what can I get you?"" Teresa: ""One podcast, please."" Travis: ""Ughghughu, let me check your total....It's Shmanners!"" 
   * God I fucking hate these people.
   * It is kinda cute that Teresa thinks people say ""please"" in a drive-thru. Lol. Lmao even.
* Husband host, wife host, extraordinary etiquette, ordinary occasions, hello my dove, hello dear, yada yada, you know the drill.
* ""How are you?"" ""Oh, you know. Life is lonely on the road."" ""I don't know how to take that because I was with you. So how lonely was it?"" Teresa laughing uproariously as if this was the funniest thing that anyone had ever said. 
   * They're back from a live show circuit, which means they're almost definitely gonna be sick.
* ""We're gonna pull the curtain back and tell you how we came up with this topic. Because we were driving for two and a half hours, and had to stop and get lunch at a fast-a food-a restaurant."" 
   * I don't know why Travis thought he needed to 1) explain this and 2) do a weird thing with his voice, because literally everyone in America uses drive-thrus on a regular basis so nobody would wonder why this was on your mind and also, anti-Italian hate is no laughing matter. Do better, Big Dog.
* ""I did find that there is a debate over drive-thru being spelled drive dash T H R U, or drive-through being spelled drive dash T H R O U G H.""
   * No there fucking isn't Teresa, nobody gives a fuck.
* Travis tries to insist that quick service is a synonym, except it isn't actually, because it includes stuff like, uh, urrugh, Subway? Where there isn't a window but isn't sit down. And Teresa jumps in to talk about counter service, where you order at a counter but they still bring you your food. Travis says quick service is a bigger umbrella. Teresa mentions Fazoli's. ""Fast food Italian? What will they think of next?""
   * Mentioning Fazoli's is kinda the second anti-Italian hate crime in 3 minutes here, huh.
   * Also lots of Subways *do* have windows, Travis.
   * Also this is completely fucking asinine and has nothing to do with anything because the episode is *drive-thrus*, goddammit, not ""every restaurant that isn't full service."" Focus up ya dumb bastards.
* ""Now I'm gonna guess, the drive-thru didn't exist before the car, am I right?"" Teresa laughs at her idiot husband.
   * *Wrong,* Travis! Wrong! The Romans were driving fuckin chariots through thermopolia by the first century! 
* ""You are correct!"" **NO THE FUCK HE ISN'T TERESA**
* ""I suppose someone could have thrown food into your buggy, but."" 
   * **TERESA YOU STUPID FUCK**
   * God I fucking hate them both so much
   * Just the sheer unearned confidence with which they say absolute bullshit that could be figured out in 30 seconds on Google tops
* ""There is archaeological evidence of drive-thru restaurants back in caveman days where they'd bring huge racks of ribs"" **OH MY GOD TRAVIS SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU JACKASS**
* Anyway. Yes the drive-thru concept existed before the car. Ancient Greco-Roman cities had what are called thermopolia (singular thermopolium), which were attached to, but not accessible from, a house. They served ready-to-eat food from earthenware jars set into counters. They were decorated with frescoes, often related to what the particular thermopolium sold. You could walk up, or ride up. They were favored by people who didn't have their own kitchens, and looked down upon by those who could afford their own kitchens and kitchen staff. They really were functionally identical, in terms of societal niche, to today's drive-thrus. They've been found in sites such as Pompeii.
   * Speaking of Pompeii, I still have 45 minutes of Shmanners to listen to, and really, how *am* I gonna be an optimist about this?
   * Presumably, Travis, Teresa, and Alex failed to learn any of this while researching because the Romans didn't literally use the words ""drive-thrv.""
* ""By World War II or thereabouts, there was carhop service.""
   * Travis talks about a locally-owned restaurant like that in Oklahoma when he was in school, and Sonic had tried to buy them out but they refused to sell, so Sonic opened up next door to try and undercut them but both were always busy. He doesn't remember the name of the place but hopes it still exists. I can't find whether it does or not because he doesn't remember the exact name and I don't care enough to really try and track it down, but I do like that and hope they're still around too.
* ""In 1947, there was recorded the first drive-thru.""
   * Again, not really. The Romans.
   * But also, the passive voice wording struck my ear kinda funny here? 
   * Not as annoying as Travis's Flintstones bit which went on way too long and culminated with him screaming ""WIIIIILLLMMAAAA"" but. Y'know.
* It was Red's Giant Hamburg in Springfield, Missouri, on Route 66.
   * Travis says, ""Ah, Route 66. The varicose veins of the nation. The lifeblood. The heartbeat. Something.""
   * First off Travis obviously does not know what varicose veins are.
   * Second you know the only thing he knows about Route 66 comes from watching Cars.
* ""But Red's closed in 1984, so In-N-Out Burger is probably the longest-lived drive-thru."" ""But...what about McDonald's? I thought you were gonna say McDonald's! \[gasp\]"" ""Nope."" ""Really?!?!"" ""There were McDonald's in the 70s that didn't have drive-thrus."" ""I honest to God thought, until now, that it would be McDonald's!""
   * Smoking Ben Affleck dot jpeg.
* Travis bitches about how long it takes to go through the In-N-Out drive-thru for an unnecessarily long time.
* In-N-Out, 1948. Jack in the Box, also conceived of as drive-thru from the jump, 1951.
   * Travis says, ""Okay, In-N-Out, that makes sense as the name. Jack in the Box....Is it like a tiny restaurant with only one guy in it?"" 
   * I'm going to beat his ass. Full-on unprotected chair shot to the head. My god.
   * Also, Teresa is just literally listing the founding dates of burger joints. This isn't even history.
* Travis ""bemoans"" how these restaurants must have changed the face of cuisine, and even health. He wonders if there's any kind of documentary or anything exploring that.
   * This man is the most terminally incurious human being I've ever heard of that isn't, like, an out-and-out fascist. 
* He then backpedals and says ""I'm not here to judge"" and he doesn't have a problem with people who need affordable fast meals.
* ""The way that we order has completely changed since the drive-thru."" And Teresa explains the use of pictures and numbers to increase the number of customers they can process in a particular amount of time. 
* Teresa talks about the stack, and how some drive-thrus now are designed to actually *slow* you, by, for example, having a menu board before you get to the speaker. That way, you look and know what you want by the time you get to the speaker, and your time from speaker arrival to window is less.
   * The length of stack is fucking *huge*. I worked at one Starbucks with about a 3-car stack and one with a 5-car stack, and it's hard to directly compare bc the former had a staff that didn't care, so they were slower anyway, but I think it made a huge difference.
   * For those who don't know, a ""stack"" in this context is the number of cars that can fit between the order point and the pickup point. At Starbucks, our metric was window time. We wanted the average amount of time someone waited at the window to be under 49 seconds. Obviously, big orders take longer, ""one black coffee"" takes about the 15 seconds you need for a card to process, but on average, 49. A bigger stack means you've got more time to work after they order but before they get to the window, which makes it easier to keep window times down.
   * (Since I've left the target time has been reduced to 45, then 40, while cutting labor and adding a requirement to write on every cup. You might say ""well wait isn't it impossible to do more with less labor and be faster?"" but that's why you're not a private equity billionaire.)
   * Other companies use different metrics. Some focus on overall time from ordering to departure.
* Teresa says obviously these considerations vary, because there aren't really any rules. Travis jumps in to say, ""Well I'm gonna interrupt you, because there *are*, before we get tweets and emails. Especially if there's, like, mystery shoppers."" 
   * What she obviously meant in context is there's not like, regulations about how to optimize drive-thru times. What he's talking about is those internal metrics that companies use. These are not contradictory but Travis can't resist saying something in an obnoxiously smug way to get one over on Teresa.
* ""So I worked at a quick service restaurant, at Jimmy Johns, and we were told that they should have their sandwich before they get their change. And I was always on register, because they would tell me, Travis, make a Hunter, and I'd say, Ughawauwha, I've never made that sandwich, and they'd say, Just get on register then!"" 
   * This does not surprise me
   * I bet having Travis on register was good for that Jimmy Johns not just because he couldn't make sandwiches, but because his inability to shut the fuck up probably increased the order-to-change-received time and gave the sandwich line a second to breathe
   * He says he was offered management after six months but quit. I'm kinda pressing X on this one chat.
* Travis says that he has a billion-dollar idea: Put a second set of menus closer to the line inside a restaurant so they can see it before they get to the counter. Teresa tries to refocus him on the thing they're actually talking about by saying ""well that's what I was saying about having them in the drive-thru while you're waiting to get to the speaker box."" 
   * I don't know about you, Teresa might be waiting to get to the speaker box, but I'm waiting for the love below.
* Teresa says drive-thrus are becoming a necessity for even things you wouldn't think, and mentions how 60% of new Starbucks locations are drive-thrus, because ""the coffee experience isn't something people savor anymore, it's more of a fix, if you know what I mean."" Travis says, ""Oh, I do know what you mean.""
   * My first Starbucks was a cafe store and it was by far the best one I worked at. It was nice having a community, it was nice being mostly regulars who would hang out for a while, it was nice not having the constant more-more-more volume driving that dominates the company. The explosion in mobile ordering and drive-thru that started picking up dramatically in 2019-2020 killed what was good about working there and I hung around much too long hoping for things to return to a way they never will.
* ""And even Starbucks is now focusing on those off-highway kind of locations.""
   * Spent 2 years at an interstate store and it fucking sucked ass.
   * Here's an etiquette tip: If you stop off the interstate and take your dog out to relieve itself, or change your baby in a parking lot, you absolutely should not take the dirty diapers or dogshit bags and hurl them over the wall of the dumpster enclosure to land on the pavement around the dumpsters. If you do that I think there should be an employee sniper on the roof ready to pick you off.
* ""What's interesting is in my lifetime, I remember being like 6 or 7 and going to birthday parties in McDonald's, and the play place, and they had tvs where you could watch cartoons, and it was focused on the indoor experience, and the drive-thru was a necessity when you didn't have time, but now it's about speeding up the drive-thru, and renovating to get rid of indoor stuff but you've got two lines to make the drive-thru fast."" Yeah man. Shit sucks.
   * Travis, you recognize the problems of late-stage capitalism. Now you must accept that knocking over a filing cabinet isn't enough. Let me tell you the story of the prophet Mikhail Timofeyevich Kalashnikov, and his vision for all people to become equal.
* Teresa talks about Wienerschnitzel (the hot dog chain, not the food) and the A-frame restaurants you drive through the middle of as kind of a cool variation, and it is.
* Travis says that's ""kinda like drive-thru beer places"" before wondering ""do they have those other places?"" I have family from Texas and have spent some time there and can tell you they absolutely do have those. I believe I've seen them in Florida. If you aren't from the PvP-enabled zones of the US where drive-thru beer and liquor are an option and this is your first time learning about them: congrats, I'm sorry. International jerkers who might be learning about them for the first time, please understand that these things are considered insane even by most Americans.
* Teresa says ""I wanna talk about how the drive-thru changed the way cars are constructed"" and she says it very dramatically before revealing she means cupholders. And like, yeah, I mean that is a thing, it's a change, but she definitely sounded like she was building to something bigger.
   * ""By the 1980s, there were cars with more cupholders than seats."" 
   * I do want a car with a cupholder armrest. 
   * I want a car that will get me there.
* She talks about the introduction of the two-way speaker by Jack in the Box in the 50s.
   * One time my Starbucks's speaker went out and we had to take it in shifts to sit by the speaker and use the headsets to relay orders to the people inside. It was like 95 degrees that day and it sucked ass.
* ""I can't believe we've made it 20 minutes and I haven't asked you. What's your favorite fast food?""
   * Travis you've been married for years you should probably have known that before ""halfway through the podcast episode on drive-thrus""
   * Teresa says Rally's/Checker's. Travis decides to be annoying and break it down to say Arby's has the best fries, but Burger King has the best non-curly fries, Wendy's has the best burgers, and then he says his inner West Virginia is coming out because he really loves the fry bits you get from Long John Silver's.
   * This digression is overly long, but I do resonate a bit with that, because my family ALSO always requested extra fry bits from Captain D's, and I know it's super gross but it is really good.
   * Travis talks about McDonald's chicken fajitas, which weren't available everywhere. They bat a few regional McDonald's items back and forth, pizza, bratwurst. None of those were available where I was. Teresa then asks Travis if they had the salad shake-ups. Travis gets a little chuckle from me by saying, ""I mean, were they *available*? Sure. Did I *have* them?""
   * Anyway, favorite fast food for me is Whataburger, those Texan sickos know what's up.
* Ad break!
* Not listening to the ads, but I *am* struck by how we're going to the listener questions section with literally zero etiquette advice.
* Travis says the first question is one they've gotten like ten times: ""Is it okay to go through a drive-thru without a car?""
   * **NO! NO YOU STUPID FUCK HEADS!**
   * Travis lists three reasons this is a bad idea: First and foremost, your safety. A person on foot in a car lane is at high risk, especially when it's dark or visibility is otherwise impaired. Second, you won't get served, because the lane has weight sensors at the speaker to let us know you're there, and a person on foot or on a bike simply won't set them off. Even a motorcycle may not. Third, safety for the people inside. If someone walks up to a window, and they don't have that level shift and barrier introduced by the car, it's real easy for them to reach inside the window, and the staff know that. I'm not true-crime-brained enough to think it's *super* likely, but if someone is already doing something unexpected and dangerous (like walking up to my window), my estimation of the chances they do something *else* unexpected and dangerous goes up.
* Teresa says she expected they'd get more questions about double drive-thrus, and how to merge, so she looked it up, and since she did like a minute and half of work she answers this question even though nobody asked. 
* ""Is it rude to ask for multiple orders in a drive-thru?""
   * Teresa says up to 3 in a car with one check is fine. Multiple checks, go inside.
   * Travis says read the room, if there's no line you have a little more leeway.
   * They agree that the more complex your order, the better-served you are going inside.
   * My experience, two checks in a car, fine. Even if they're multiple items, within reason. More than that, or lots of items? Come the fuck inside.
   * What do you *mean* you're ordering 7 refreshers, 2 fraps, 13 ham and cheese croissants, and 2 bacon gouda sandwiches in a fucking drive-thru? I wish my religion had a hell so I could tell you to go there.
* Oh hey this fucking sucks, Teresa just said that her dad loves drive-thru burgers, and would get one on his way home even though he was gonna eat dinner at home. And Travis says, ""And he's a skinny man!"" To which Teresa agrees, ""He's a fit man."" 
   * Love that casual fatphobia! It's so cool to know that you guys don't really think I'm a person!
   * Anyway, skinny and fit are not synonymous, diet is only one factor in either of those conditions, kiss my ass.
* She also uses a mocking tone to describe her sisters as pickier for wanting ""no pickles, no ketchup, ehhhh"" so that sucks too.
* ""Is it rude to check your order is correct before you pull away?""
   * Travis and Teresa say to pull ahead a car length so the next person can get their stuff while you're looking and that's okay.
* There's a question about if you should know what you want before you pull in or is it okay to look. Teresa says she wants clarification about what they mean by pulling in, but you don't get clarification, dipshit, this isn't live radio. 
   * Teresa says if you don't know what's on the menu, try to look before you're at the speaker. Let the person at the speaker know that you need a minute. 
   * Travis actually has something good to say about this: Don't let the technology distract you from what's happening. There's a person there, just like there's a person waiting on you when you sit down. If you sit down and look at a menu, you can say ""I need one second."" If you're ready, you can say ""I'm ready"" and go ahead. It's the same thing, there's a person waiting on you, they're just on the other side of a speaker. Still act like it's a person. Be nice, listen, thank them, have your payment ready.
   * Teresa interrupts to say ""I read an article that says the future is touch-screen ordering,"" but Travis says, ""Okay, but that doesn't change that if at any point you're interacting with a person, that's a *person.*"" He digs in and says that if at any point you think of yourself as above a fast food worker, you need to take a step back, get off your high horse, and think about how hard they're working to make food for you.
   * Holy shit where is *this* Big Dog most of the time? Like. Genuinely. This is good! It's something a lot of people don't factor into their behavior, and they should, and he sounds genuinely, righteously passionate about it!
   * Then they squander all the goodwill by Travis saying ""I'm getting off my horse now,"" Teresa saying ""well you were on a soapbox,"" Travis going ""that's right, *they* were on the high horse,"" and then they banter about the relative heights of horses and soapboxes and I'm back to wanting to powerbomb them.
   * Anyway, from the perspective of a supervisor who was held responsible for those 49-second window times: it's perfect if you already know, but if you take a second to look that's fine. Just don't sit on my speaker for like 6 minutes trying to figure it out. Come inside if you want that kind of time, not least because the people behind you are going to be mad about the delay, and they're not gonna talk to you, they're gonna take it out on me. Plus it disrupts the pace of work; if we've got a steady flow, we're in our routine, but if we have to stop for 5 minutes because someone is holding up at the speaker, and can't do anything, then they order and are followed up by rapid-fire orders of people who were ready and got delayed, it's a lot harder.
* Next question is about if nobody greets you at the speaker, should you ask if anyone's there or wait it out?
   * Teresa says it's okay to ask as long as you remember to treat them like a person. Like ""hello?"" not ""HEY YOU I'M HERE!"" Travis agrees that you can just say ""hello"" like a greeting, rather than ""uh, HELLO?!?! exCUSE me?!?!"" 
   * God there was not much that pissed me off more than when I would be solo drive (that is, taking orders and handling the window) and someone would pull the ""uh, HELLO?!?!"" after like 3 seconds or less while I'm processing the window transaction. 
   * A subset that pissed me off almost as much was when I (or whoever was on solo drive) would respond immediately to the speaker beep with ""thanks for choosing Starbucks, I'll be right with you"" and the person would launch into their order. Most of us would say something like ""I'm sorry, hang on one second, we'll be right with you,"" and sometimes if it was a new person and I was in a different position as supervisor I'd go over the speaker and say ""hang on just one second, please."" But I had one who would passive-aggressively let them rattle off their whole order, not pay any attention to them because they'd been told to wait, and when they were done say, ""Thank you for your patience, what can I get started for you?"" and it was always so fuckin funny.
* ""Is it ever appropriate to honk if someone is taking too long or not paying attention when the line is moving?""
   * Teresa sounds dumbfounded that anyone would ask. No. It's not.
* ""My car window doesn't work. I open my door in the drive thru. Is that okay?""
   * Travis says that if it's temporary, sure, fine, but maybe work on getting it fixed bc you don't want to always be getting out of your car.
   * I think Travis is misunderstanding, bc I saw this frequently, and the person isn't like, getting *out*. They're just pulling ahead a little and ordering through an open door rather than an open window. That doesn't have the safety concerns of getting out.
   * That said, this would sometimes cause problems bc the headsets transmit when a car is activating the sensors at the box, and if you pull forward to open your door, sometimes the car is no longer triggering the sensors and the audio can cut out.

And that's the episode! I was pleasantly surprised by a little bit of this one! Most of it was nothing, some of it was quite bad, and the ""research"" was as always an insult to the term, but there was about 60 seconds of Travis actually showing some fire for human decency. 

I will say one *huge* miss as far as drive-thru etiquette, because it was something I had to deal with all the time, and it always sucked, it's fucking rude, don't do it: Nobody but the driver needs to order. I cannot hear you shouting from the far side of the car. Relay the order to the driver, let them say it to the speaker. *Extra* don't pull up some weird recipe you found on TikTok and try to play the video from your phone. The two-way speaker is not sensitive enough for anyone but the person closest to it, speaking at a normal-to-slightly-loud human volume, to come through with any kind of clarity.

So that's shmive-thrus. Be good to your service workers. Don't throw things at us, don't hit on workers (and extra don't do it if you're old enough to be their grandpa), don't be visibly intoxicated because we're not the cops and don't wanna be but we also don't wanna be responsible for seeing you drunk or high and sending you onto the roadway. Wear pants. ",6,1760891402.0,TAZCirclejerk,3,0.87,False

We all having a miscommunication sometimes, we also have a language barrier, but let’s talk about that little later.. let’s talk about stuff what I so call f… it up. Just recently I mede her worst anniversary, I wasn’t ready to gift present in the morning, she gifted one. I wasn’t ready and I don’t know why I said that I don’t have anything for her. I didn’t mean that I don’t have anything for her at all but that unfortunately after I left for work and had a bad day, didn’t send her any message she believed that I don’t have anything for her. Coming me later after work with flowers already was not working. Never mind presents with delay next day. 

It was her worst anniversary our 3rd. I am 37 she is now 39. I am Latvian she is German and we speak in English. I don’t really remember that we talk this out completely. But the message was clear, with this morning speech that I don’t have anything for her wasn’t right thing to say.  Ok! Living on! 

She works a lot, way too much, she also just change her job, so a lot of stress work related. I listen to everything sometimes it’s little hard to keep up but I listen. Sometimes I don’t have anything to say or I already said some opinion about this topic, so I don’t want to keep repeating myself about the same situation just from different angle. 
   
Anyway, won’t let you wait long for any next “fukup”
It’s her birthday 51 days later, obviously I won’t make same mistake and I was prepared. Gift her present in the morning. Everything ok with that. I want to add that we both being sick at the moment also. Sleep in different rooms coz I got little but harder version of the virus and taking some antibiotics. We went out for the morning coffee and I went to bed straight after. She ask me then later see me in the bed. Are you going to sleep? And I said yes. “ in my head I just took some meds and I will just rest a little” , but I wasn’t ready for her to say that she will plan a day without me. I simply was upset, it’s her birthday and she decided to cut me out. I went and said what you mean? Plan the day without me? And she said yes if you still sick and want to sleep do that. I want to do something, it’s my birthday. So yeah I went back to bed. 08:30 in the morning. Then she start cleaning the flat and I was just sleeping all day stupidly people come in and I just didn’t bother. 

Later on in the evening when she came back I couldn’t help myself to make it worst. I wanted to find out what is exactly happening. In my stupid head this didn’t fit together, it’s your birthday and you want to plan day without me, so I don’t want to spoil your birthday. But still for me it’s not nice thing to hear that you want to cut me out. She said I am like this and I said like this. I had an all chances to help anyway to spend day with her, but I was sleeping so it’s my problem. So yeah happy birthday  to her, 39 and the worst one yet coz of her.

I try to make it up through nice gestures and making coffees, cleaning all morning kitchen myself and in 2 days I managed to come close to the peace, but this morning again. Now wish I never offer myself to drive her and her daughter to church. 
Really more than half of our arguments and miss communication we had in the car. For some reason after the junction after she raise the hand and told me just a little bit more straight “what I didn’t really hear “ I went straight for the stop, I know that the church is still about 250-  300m away she was confused why I want to stop and I explain that her hand little bit misdirected me, then she said that I “always” having some problems on the road and don’t listen to me.

Still that “always” word was a slap for me, and after she came back from the church she saw that my mood has changed. She was already over it, but I start talk about it and it led to complete different topics, she said that we never had a good conversation, only good in bed. I said that I am not her ex husband who you can talk about work and flirt daily 30-40min. Yes I said flirt, then I corrected myself that I heard her saying compliments to him. Obviously not the same thing and yes it was water already spilled big time.

1oatqij,https://v.redd.it/s9r88zkwf3wf1,Judge my technique and help me improve it [no bloom; 2 pours; wet-WDT; melodrip],"I am very sensitive to bitterness and astringency. Usually I want my coffee bright and tea-like, but with some body and juicyness.

__________

First some background and insight into my learning process.

Seeking this kind of cup Ive mentioned at the start of the post, here is what I’ve been doing, trying and learning:
- Bought a ZP6. Found that grinding below 5 always turned out astringent and sometimes bitter. Grinding between 5 and 6 was working best, which probably shows there was something off with my pouring technique (which leads to the next bulletpoint).
- Bought a Melodrip. Tried Stéphane’s (from The Picky Chemist) recipe, grinding at 2.3 and only 2 equal pours - but wasn’t happy, also turned out astringent and sometimes bitter. After testing, found that grinding between 3.5 and 4.8 is what worked best with a Melodrip + zp6 (using 2 or 3 pours).
- I started noticing some bubbling during the whole brewtime. That indicated channeling, which would explain the astringency and bitterness I was getting. Leads us to the next bulletpoint.
- Bought a WDT tool and started doing the wet weiss technique. That really helped reducing the visual signs of channeling. Despite wet weiss increasing extraction (its been tested), this allowed me to grind finer and to improve flowrate. Drawdown is always finishing before 2m15s here even grinding at 3-3.5 with the ZP6.

&nbsp;

So summarizing it: i) the ZP6 and/or the Melodrip, each by itself or combined, was/were not enough to give me a tea-like, round and consistent extraction; ii) adding a WTD tool is what got me the closest to my ideal cups.

With the WDT I have noticed that there is a dense pocket of grounds at the lower section of the v60, which is probably what was causing channeling. This is my main focus with the WDT: breaking this pocket and creating a more uniform/consistent slurry. 

*I have included at the end of my video a short section of a video from the Melodrip creator Ray Murakawa. It shows this denser pocket of coffee sitting at the bottom after the initial pour. That’s my culprit for the channeling!* Video here if anyone’s interested: https://youtu.be/HhvZn-tKyj4?si=-udx5so4he6Tar6b

___________

Now describing my current technique and the video:
- Lotus Water personal recipe (3 drops Mg, 1 Ca, 1 Na and 1 K - for a total of 650mL of demineralized water).
- Water temp between 85c and 95c (depending on the process and roast level). Usually 92 is what I usually choose (and beware the Melodrip reduces some of the temperature).
- Grind between 3.5 and 4.5 with the zp6. Usually closer to 4.2.
- After adding the grounds, I like using the WDT tool to mix the grounds and creating this whole in the center. I think it might help reducing the mass of the denser pocket I diagnosed as the cause of channeling.
- Usually I brew 13g for 200mL total water (1:15.3 ratio). 
- No bloom, 2 equal pours (2x100mL).
- All pours with a Melodrip. During both pours, I keep the Melodrip fairly low to reduce agitation. 
- After the first pour, I use the WDT tool to mix and break the lowest part of the coffee bed. The I use it to remove the grounds from the filter walls; and to redistribute the grounds, creating as flat of a bed as possible. 
- Usually try slowing down both pours. First one finished around 20, which is usually completely drained by 1min; second pour until 1m20s, which is usually drained until 2m-2m15s.

&nbsp;

That has been giving the best cups I have ever brewed! But I sometimes miss the lighter body, acidity and crispness a direct pour might produce… so there is still room for improvements.

__________

What do you find of this all? Any comments or suggestions? Really looking forward to learning and finding ways to test other approaches that might improve my cup.

Never settle for *good enough* - I am seeking the perfect cup.

Some notes:
*sped up the video to not use too much of your time.
**started filming with my hand blocking the view but soon adjusted, but it should be 1 continuous pour.
