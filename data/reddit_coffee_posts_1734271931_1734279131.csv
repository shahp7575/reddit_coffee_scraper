Over the year I have lost majority of friends due to my work schedules and have been unlucky soo far when it comes to making a new friend who would stick around. I‚Äôve been wanting to find someone who would be willing to spend time with me on a daily gaming together and chatting. If you‚Äôre a gamer then that would be great!

Some facts about me would include being a 5‚Äô2 shorty, love gaming (obviously), loves coffee, likes all things fantasy, scifi, horror, love to cook and hate spiders! There‚Äôs probably a lot more. üòÇ I‚Äôm quite timid and bit of an introvert so I apologise if I do not jump on mic very fast until I‚Äôve gotten to know you bit more.

When it comes to gaming I mainly play on PS5 and occasionally the Switch. Games I usually play are Ark Survival Ascended, Monster Hunter World & Rise (Switch), Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3, Elden Ring, Path of Exile 2, Borderlands 3, No Mans Sky, Remnant 2, Palworld, Nioh 2, Far Cry series, Super Smash bros ult, Pokemon, Minecraft, Terraria and more. Dragon Age & Mass Effect are my all time favourites too. I normally play after work around the evenings until late.

1hevqaw,https://i.redd.it/ztw20rfhd17e1.jpeg,Almost done with my first month! ,"37 F 5‚Äô4 SW 201 CW 185.5 GW 140 Current Dosage 2.5

5 days til my first month is down and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. I‚Äôve been on this sub prior to starting, gathering information and trying to prepare the best I could and started stockpiling 2 weeks into my journey once I realized how great I felt. I have read many of your success posts but never understood what food noise was and how it was controlling my life. I feel like the biggest weight has been lifted off my shoulders. 

My highest weight ever was in 2017 at 250. I had gastric sleeve surgery and got to around 150. I maintained that loss til 2023 when I had my first child. After having her I was hovering around 195-200 and struggled to drop any more. 

One thing I‚Äôm struggling with is getting enough water in. My daily protein intake is between 90-100 grams which I know needs improvement. But my water consumption is truly lacking. GS surgery made it so I couldn‚Äôt drink and eat at the same time. During that time it made be focus on getting in protein and as the years went by I basically would only drink coffee in the morning and 1 bottle of those ICE sparkling waters. Prior to beginning tirze I tried to focus on consuming enough water to prepare but since I‚Äôve started I‚Äôm finding it difficult. I have one of those large water bottles with the time/oz in hopes to remind me to drink more. I‚Äôm struggling to finish 1 per day - it‚Äôs only 32oz. The main issue I‚Äôm having is drinking water feels like eating food - I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense to anyone but I drink it and it fills me up so much to the point where I cannot consume anymore. It‚Äôs a similar feeling to when I eat and drink at the same time - there‚Äôs just not enough room. I think it relates to my previous surgery. Has anyone else had GS surgery and started tirze?

Has anyone else struggled with their water intake and if so have you gotten past it? Would love to hear how others make sure they get enough in. 

I‚Äôm considering doing 16:8 intermittent fasting where I only eat from 10am-6pm and fast the remaining 16 hours. I think that may make it easier to get more water in during the fasting period since I will not be eating. Does anyone have any experience with intermittent fasting while on tirze?

1hevod4,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1hevod4/looking_to_hear_from_baristas_that_work_in/,Looking to hear from baristas that work in non-traditional settings,"I‚Äôve worked in specialty/third wave coffee for 5 years. I‚Äôve also worked in non-traditional settings such as a plant nursery and currently, a dive bar. I honestly consider myself highly skilled and educated about coffee and I love working in the industry.  

For the nursery and dive bar, I was hired because the owners didn‚Äôt know about coffee and wanted my expertise/knowledge. But lately at my current job, I feel like I‚Äôm being constantly disrespected. I feel like management doesn‚Äôt think coffee is a profession and that there‚Äôs more to it than just brewing a pot of coffee. I‚Äôm being ignored when I try to explain that certain things aren‚Äôt going to work or we need to make changes. 

For example, I was given a bag of beans and told to try it as espresso. We have one grinder for espresso and it was full, so I was given one of those mini grinders where you press down and it continually grinds. I explained that won‚Äôt work and was told ‚Äúyou‚Äôll do your best.‚Äù It took me about 20 minutes to get a shot that wasn‚Äôt 11 or 45 seconds, and still it was gross. 

Our menu prices for coffee make no sense - a latte is a dollar more than a double shot, a macchiato and cappuccino are the same price. I‚Äôve brought it up but heard nothing back.

These are just some examples. This is the highest paying coffee job I‚Äôve had so far (at an hourly rate) so I know I should probably just shut up and go along with it, clock in get my money, and clock out. But I feel like mediocrity is not fair to people who spend their hard earned money on our goods. 

I do really enjoy this job - it‚Äôs generally super chill and laid back, I‚Äôve met some really awesome customers because it‚Äôs in a unique area and the bar has a long and interesting history. I get fed by the kitchen, I can sit down when I‚Äôm not serving customers. I just feel like we can really improve to make it a truly unique space.

2. We Be Jammin- started by a man with ASD and his family, they have some of the most unique/tastiest jams, salad dressings, sauces, salsas and more that I‚Äôve ever seen. They go to a lot of farmer‚Äôs markets, have an online store, and a building on Post Rd in Warwick. 
      https://www.webejamminri.com/

3. RI Food Fights- for a flat fee, you get coupons to try a ton of different local businesses‚Äô items. I get the iced coffee every year, last year there were 50+ shops offering at least a small iced and I paid like $25. I defined tipped everywhere I went a dollar, but it‚Äôs still a steal either way.

A man in his 30s sat next to me and initially struck up a harmless conversation. However, his demeanor quickly shifted, and he began asking invasive and personal questions. As we approached my destination, I attempted to extricate myself from the conversation.

To my surprise, the man followed me off the bus, insisting on carrying my luggage despite my protests. He then asked me out for coffee, which I declined, prompting him to raise his voice. The situation escalated, and I felt increasingly uncomfortable. What's more alarming is that he somehow obtained my Instagram handle and began messaging me.

I'm compelled to ask: why do some men engage in such behavior? Is this a pervasive issue in Delhi, or was this an isolated incident? As a woman, I shouldn't have to feel unsafe or anxious in public spaces. While it's easy to suggest taking immediate action, the reality is far more complex.

I'd like to pose a question to the men reading this: how would you respond if you witnessed or experienced a similar situation? What actions would you take to ensure the woman's safety and comfort?",1,1734278556.0,delhi,0,1.0,False

After lurking around this sub for some time , I‚Äôve finally decide to write a post here and try my luck. Below is a small introduction about me and what I‚Äôm seeking. 

I am 24M, currently working at a MNC as a data analyst. I am also preparing for a switch since its been 2+ yrs at my current company.

Regarding my personal life, I like to travel. I usually travel with friends, but recently I also went on a solo trip and really enjoyed it. Other than that, I really like to try out different cuisine or visit museum or watch movies in my free time. I also read occasionally whenever I get the time to. I don't smoke. Also, I rarely drink and last drink I had was 6-7 months back. I am more into taste of the food, instead of the high we get from alcohol.

I am looking for someone who is curious and seeking a long term relationship, with potential to move to next serious step. I‚Äôm 24, so anyone who is 21 to 27 yrs old is fine for me. I just want someone with whom I can have a genuine conversation over a cup of coffee and talk about the most random thing and enjoy it.

I‚Äôve decided to be CF since I want to enjoy my life and don‚Äôt want to raise another human. I‚Äôve seen my parents putting so much efforts into their children and how parents life revolve around their children only.

He didn't answer, so I went on with life.

Me: ""Ask him if he wants another hot toddy.""

So I made a second hot beverage and put it in a tall plastic coffee cup with a lid.

Fast forward to this morning. I got up at 4 a.m. to drive my sister to the airport, just over an hour away. Fixed myself a coffee for the drive and off we went. Pleasant morning, dry roads, no traffic. I felt pretty good considering I am NOT a morning person. But I kept thinking that my coffee tasted kinda weird. 

I was within view of the airport when I realized that the reason my coffee tasted like shit was the lingering miasma of Jack Daniel's in the plastic. Threw it away when I got home. ",2,1734278153.0,PointlessStories,0,1.0,False

The kind of place where cobblestones echo with stories and soft light spills from shuttered windows. There‚Äôs no set destination‚Äîjust us, sharing thoughts, laughter, and half-serious dreams of what we‚Äôd do if this moment lasted forever. We stop at a little caf√©, where the coffee is warm and the conversation is even warmer. The world feels infinite, but for now, it‚Äôs just the two of us‚Äîand that‚Äôs more than enough.

I‚Äôm here searching for someone who dreams of moments like these. Could that be you?

# About Me

I‚Äôm a quiet soul with a curious mind‚Äîa writer, future vinyl collector, and lover of golden hours. My passions range from creating playlists that feel like soundtracks to discovering hidden hiking trails and catching fleeting beauty with my camera.

I thrive on deep conversations, small joys, and moments that linger in your memory long after they‚Äôve passed. While I enjoy solo pursuits like gaming or reading, my greatest happiness comes from shared experiences and meaningful connections.

I‚Äôm looking to start with friendship‚Äîsomething genuine and unforced, like the first chapter of a great story. Maybe it evolves into something more, but for now, I‚Äôd love to connect and see where the pages lead us.

# What I‚Äôm Looking For

I‚Äôm searching for someone who is kind, thoughtful, and curious‚Äîa woman who dreams big, appreciates life‚Äôs quirks, and values honesty. You don‚Äôt need to have it all figured out (who does?), but you should have a desire to share your world while exploring a new one together.

Whether it‚Äôs collaborating on a project, swapping music recommendations, or planning spontaneous adventures, I‚Äôm looking for a partner who is ready to dream, build, and laugh along the way.

# What Sets Me Apart

I notice the little things‚Äîthe way your eyes light up when you talk about something you love or how the world feels quieter under a blanket of stars. Loyalty is my foundation. I show up for the big moments and the small ones, believing that consistency and care are the cornerstones of a great connection.

I‚Äôm also a romantic in the best way: someone who leaves sweet notes, remembers your favorite things, and turns ordinary days into something a little magical.

If this resonates, let‚Äôs swap stories, playlists, or dreams. Whether it‚Äôs the start of a friendship or something more, let‚Äôs see where our chapter together takes us.",1,1734278040.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

How does the inferno staff feel, what's it like to use outside the psykhanium?

Aiming the Voidblast ground effect is annoying as hell. Like I can do it but ffs I'd like to look at something other than the ground all game and accuracy at range is a trick I've yet to figure out how to even start to get good at since I can't see the circle once it gets a certain distance away. It just sort of disappears. 

Voidstrike is a bitch and a half to lead and gets blocked by mosquitoes. 

Electrokinetic's damage is extremely disappointing and the range feels inconsistent.  
  
With all three staves its irritating that the primary fire kills shit quicker than the charged version.  With the Voidblast and Voidstrike it at least makes sense as an AoE V. ST DPS but Electrokinetic's cleave effect is hardly enough to warrant that difference imo, you're still better off just spamming the little balls. 

I don't want to waste time leveling the inferno staff if it sounds like something I wont like. I'm exhausted and about at burnout from leveling three disappointments in a row. All three of which I tried in the Psykhanium first and thought, ""fuck yeah this is going to cook,"" then hated them in actual combat application.

And I want to be clear, I don't dislike Psyker.  I have a Scrier's gaze Smite melee Psyker and a Scrier's gaze Smite gun Psyker and both of those cook but neither really feel like a space wizard as much as a coked up crash out veteran, but no, not like zealot, and they're both obviously very similar to each other.

I think its probably part of why I don't like the staves though. The CC is great but the things would be dead already if I were playing melee or gun Psyker and the CC isn't enough to make up for the not killing things because you can only CC things right in front of you. At least with Smite that shit locks things down almost as soon as you look at them so despite the relatively low damage it feels good to use. 

I have a similar issue with the other two blitz abilities on Psyker. BR and Assail both run into the ""just shoot/stab the thing,"" problem. Assail doesnt do enough damage to reliably chew through packs of elites before you run out of needles and have to shoot them anyway but at least its kind of decent at horde clearing. The Charge time on BR is long enough for me to go make a cup of coffee and have a wank before it pops and then it usually doesn't because someone else ""just shoots/stabs the thing,"" before it goes off. Assail is by far the more fun of the two but I just feel like I'd be better off shooting or stabbing whatever I'm throwing Assails at. 

What are some Staff Psyker build ideas that you guys like and what makes them fun to play?  I've tried several youtuber builds but I just can't feel em. 

I already vibe with 40k Sith, Scier's Gaze + Smite + Gun & Sword, but I want to vibe with the 40k Space Gandalf, I'm just not able to cook up anything that I've enjoyed so far and I'm getting stuck. ",1,1734277973.0,DarkTide,1,1.0,False
1heveao,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1heveao,"Salt Citea Private Dining Cebu-Kauswagan Road, Talamban","

I believe this is owned and managed by Chef Pia Oce√±a herself. I had the opportunity to dine here with my blockmates last week, where we chose to experience fine dining. While the establishment caters to various packages and food styles, we opted for the fine dining package to try something new. This was my first-ever six-course meal‚Äîquite an experience for a self-proclaimed ""broke person."" Here‚Äôs my honest review of each dish:  

~Appetizer: Fish in Carrot Coat (9/10)~
As someone picky about fish, I was pleasantly surprised. The fish was soft, tender, and flavorful. I didn‚Äôt get the chance to ask about the type of fish used (hunger got the better of me, and Chef Pia was busy), but it was clearly of good quality. The carrot wrap didn‚Äôt taste like carrot at all; it blended seamlessly with the fish. The texture was perfect, and the  thick soup balanced everything beautifully.  

~Soup: Velvety Beetroot Soup (7/10)~
This soup had great flavor, though it left an earthy aftertaste. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs just how beetroot normally tastes. The soup‚Äôs vibrant color and smooth, runny consistency were delightful. The square breadcrumbs on top paired well with the soup, adding texture and balance.  

~Salad: Loaded Hummus (5/10)~
This dish was the most surprising for me, and not in the best way. I envisioned something different. The hummus alone had a sandy texture and a strong, earthy flavor that I didn‚Äôt enjoy. However, when combined with the cheese, tomato, and cucumber, the taste improved significantly. The smell and aftertaste were not to my liking, but it may simply be a flavor I‚Äôm not used to yet since it was a first time for me.  

~Pasta: Aglio e Olio (8/10)~
As a pasta lover, I had high expectations, and this dish didn‚Äôt disappoint. The pasta was served al dente‚Äîexactly how I like it. The garlic flavor was felt in every bite, and the dish wasn‚Äôt overly oily. The aroma was lovely, and the overall flavor was excellent. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.  

~Main Course: Beef Bourguignon (9/10)~
The highlight of the evening for me. The beef was tender, flavorful, and of good quality. It melted in my mouth and had a slightly sweet taste from the reddish brown sauce. However, the thick white creamy sauce was a bit bland, which kept me from giving this dish a perfect score. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  

~Dessert: Caramel Tiramisu (9/10)~
This dessert was delightful. It wasn‚Äôt overly sweet, which I appreciated, and I could taste the coffee distinctly. The presentation was appealing, even if my photo didn‚Äôt do it justice. The dessert was soft and creamy, though I wish the portion had been slightly larger. But, of course, that‚Äôs fine dining for you.  


(They also served us the Berry Citrus Spark juice. I didn‚Äôt get a picture, but it was refreshing. Additionally, they offered one round of complimentary red wine.)

Overall Experience:

~Food Quality: 4/5
While the ingredients may not be the highest-end, they were undoubtedly great, the quality is still visible. Each dish felt carefully prepared and well-thought-out, making it worth the price.

~Affordability: 4/5
For a fine dining experience, it was reasonably priced, for me it's affordable.We paid 1,500 per person, which included not just the food but also the venue (which appeared to be Chef Pia‚Äôs house, not really sure). The place is tidious and presentable. This package requires a minimum of 10 people to avail. The only con here is that most of us got lost since the location was sudlonon gamay.

~Service:5/5
The service was exceptional. With over 30 of us, four servers assisted us attentively, addressing every need and answering our questions. Chef Pia and her two junior chefs also introduced each dish, sharing its origin, story, and preparation process. They were patient, even accommodating delays caused by late classmates and still ensure we had the full experience.  Chef was professional and even offered us to have fun with karaoke on her tv. Place was also air-conditioned so we were comfortable through out the evening. Lastly, just to insert I really appreciated the comfort room, it has the necessites like hand wash, tissue and there's a bidet too. I did the bidet check and it works hehe.

Let me take you back a bit.

A year ago, I discovered the Probioderm Collagen Lip Balm‚Äîa holy grail product that became my absolute favorite. When I recently returned to Korea for a trip after living there, it was at the top of my shopping list. I knew I had to buy it again. Forget souvenirs, photos, or trendy knick-knacks‚Äîthis was my one must-have.

I bought it, cherished it, and kept it tucked away in its box for two months waiting for the perfect moment to unbox it. Fast forward to two weeks ago: I saw a famous TikToker, Amy Flamy, feature it in her ‚ÄúGet Unready With Me‚Äù video, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My precious balm, my everything, was about to sell out. Sure enough, by the time I checked Olive Young Global? Sold. Out. Everywhere.

But no worries, I thought‚ÄîI already had my little treasure, untouched and waiting for me. And then last week, tragedy struck. I lost my Laneige lip mask, my other ride-or-die. In its absence, I finally unboxed my Probioderm Collagen Lip Balm. The timing felt right. It was like upgrading from a Mercedes to a Rolls-Royce.

It made me so happy every day‚Äîhydrating, plumping, and just giving me life. It wasn‚Äôt just a balm; it was my little emotional support item. And then, this week, the unthinkable happened.

I was at the library, reading for hours. I remember using my balm once, putting it in my pocket, and relocating to another spot. When I finally left at closing time, I realized‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt there. I checked my pockets, my bag, my seat‚Äînothing. My heart sank.

But I clung to hope. I told myself I‚Äôd return first thing in the morning and check the lost-and-found.

At 10AM sharp, I was back at the library. I asked at every desk, explained my situation to the staff, and even retraced my steps to the exact spot I‚Äôd been sitting. Nothing.

I tried to stay calm, but deep down, I knew. In America, most people don‚Äôt know much about K-beauty. To them, it probably looked like some cheap chapstick or even trash. But it wasn‚Äôt trash. It was $36 before tax, a product I‚Äôd been saving for, and an irreplaceable piece of my connection to Korea.

Now, I know how this might sound to some of you. It‚Äôs just a lip balm, right? But hear me out.

For me, that lip balm was more than a product. It was a daily boost of confidence, a memory of my time in Korea, and a small thing that made me genuinely happy. We all have our ‚Äúthing‚Äù‚Äîfor some people, it‚Äôs their morning coffee, a favorite playlist, or even a cigarette. For me, it was this little tube of collagen magic.

So here I am, still mourning, still hopeful that maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîit‚Äôll turn up. And if not? Well, thanks to influencers, ADHD, and my sleep deprivation, I‚Äôve learned one thing: never take your prized possessions for granted.

1heva6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/genderquestioning/comments/1heva6b/am_i_a_trans_woman_genderfluid_just_in_touch_with/,"Am I a trans woman? Genderfluid?? Just ""in touch with my feminine side"" or something???","Okay. So. I do not know where to start, so sorry if I ramble on forever or something.

I am 27, AMAB and I am not sure what my gender is or what to do about it.

I remember wishing to be a girl since the age of six, at the very least. I also had a number of traditionally feminine interests and found I had a much easier time befriending and relating to girls than boys. Of course, this could just be *because* I had some feminine interests and several personality traits usually read as feminine or at least unmasculine. And I know that the idea of ""gendered interests"" or ""gendered personality traits"" is socially constructed bs, so things like me not liking cars or soccer or whatever, me being the only boy (?) that cried when we found dead birds on the schoolyard, that obviously doesn't have to mean stuff. Maybe I only wanted to be a girl because I felt I was bad at performing masculinity and more compatible with what was traditionally presented as ""girl stuff""? Idk.

During my teens, my thoughts largely disappeared, or I don't remember having them alot, anyway. Maybe an occasional, idk, ""flare"" of thought going ""I'd rather be a girl"". At the same time, for the first time in my life, I was making male friends, though I remember ""performing"" alot to fit in eith them. Like, yeah, I liked metal music, but for them I overplayed it as a part of my personality and for them I pretended to like black coffee. I liked videogames well enough, but for them I started identifying as a gamer. You get the picture. On the other hand, I remember looking at clothes catalogues and thinking about how many dresses looked so pretty and being sad that my bodyshape was not made for them. 
I also felt some envy over the beauty of some girls. At the time, of course, I assumed it was attraction and, to be frank, I still aren't sure it wasn't? Like, I had not really figured out that I was aroace (it was a countrysite village, I knew about straight and gay, I was, like, 14 when I heard about being bi, every other part of the LGBTQ+ spectrum was, as war as I had been informed, something hypothetical and weird that happened to other people, I am deeply ashamed over many views I held back then), and so, it struck me as odd that I had no interest in dating or... physical rituals of affection... but girls were pretty, occasionally hot, even, and I did not think much harder about it?

So then I went to uni, where I had the culture shock of my life and realized that my small town-liberalism was not, in fact, the far left end of the political spectrum and that lead to me pretty quickly figuring out the aroace-thing, but reopening the matter of exploring my gender was a different beast alltogether. As my peer group became increasingly left wing (and also returned to being largely female), I was exposed to first hand accounts of trans experiences and realized that they could be. Idk. Much more ""casual"" than I would have imagined? 
Like, I had assumed they would be so different, basically alien from where I saw myself, but now I recognized myself in so much of it and I started feeling this sort of ""pull"", if that makes sense, like I would entertain the thought of being trans and there was this odd, stinging pain in me. So then, for the first time, I thought ""Maybe I am a woman?""

And then BOOM, suddenly for the first time in my entire life, I look at artworks of huge muscular, bearded men and something in me actually goes ""Neat, I would like to look like that!""
I swear, not a single time, in my entire life, before this point, had any concept of traditional masculinity appealed to me, but suddenly my brain went ""I wanna be a viking"" the fucking second I was almost at the point of accepting myself as a trans woman? It almost felt like a defense reaction, like my brain was overcorrecting to keep me bound to a male identity. Since then, my gender perception has been... confusing and unstable. Often I am drawn to contradicting ideals of what I would wish my body looked like.

For a while I tried being okay with that, joking that ""I had no idea what my gender is and at this point I'm afraid to ask"". But I feel like not having a concrete idea of what I am is actually hurting me. Existing in this odd... liminal space of conflicting identities, it is becoming unpleasant.

1hev83v,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoberAndHateIt/comments/1hev83v/27_days_later/,27 days later.... ,"Was alcohol free for 27 days until this morning. I've been feeling much better physically and mentally since I took a break from drinking. Been going on long walks, sleeping good, eating relatively healthy, staying hydrated, multivitamin/multimineral ect. Emotionally though, whoooo! was so tired of feeling bored af/ numb constantly. THC helps me a lot but it just wasn't hitting that sweet spot. 

After grocery shopping this morning I got a half pint of Jim Beam and a 24oz Heineken. Finished the half pint with my iced coffee and about to crack open my beer as I wait for the dryer to finish up. Ya know, after a month of not drinking that whiskey went down smoother than expected. That familiar warmth is starting to flow through me again. I feels great, but I know I'll probably end up with a headache and sleep like crap tonight. In this moment though, it feels worth it. A fleeting warmth and peace envelopes me as I type this post.  

I don't want to return to daily drinking or get physically dependent again. But at the same time, I don't want to avoid alcohol for the rest of my life either. Knowing my body after years of field research, I know for me personally. If I stay in the 6-8 drinks range I'll feel fine in the morning. I've dabbled with sobriety enough to know it's benefits. I know this doesn't have to be so black and white. Trying to find the grey zone. ",2,1734277475.0,SoberAndHateIt,0,1.0,False

The Cold Was Killing Us, but They Made It Worse.","This laptop feels like it‚Äôs made of lead and my hands are still figuring themselves out. Whether or not that‚Äôs from the cold still remains to be seen. Regardless, I have to write this down before the memories blur, before I start doubting myself.

We never should‚Äôve taken that trip.

\---------

It started with Lucas‚Äôs big announcement. He‚Äôd barged into my apartment, holding up a set of keys like he‚Äôd just won the lottery.

‚ÄúGuess what?‚Äù he said, grinning ear to ear.

‚ÄúI swear, if this is about another one of your lame late night escapades‚Äî‚Äù Emily called from the kitchen, not even bothering looking towards him.

‚ÄúRelax,‚Äù Lucas said, plopping down on the couch next to Anya. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt stupid. It‚Äôs genius. I got us an RV.‚Äù

Anya raised an eyebrow, her laptop screen reflecting the skeptical twist of her lips. ‚ÄúYou got an RV? Like‚Ä¶ you own it now?‚Äù

Lucas shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, no. I *borrowed* it. My cousin owed me a favor. Thing runs great.‚Äù

‚ÄúDefine ‚Äògreat,‚Äô‚Äù I said, finally acknowledging him.

‚ÄúEngine purrs like a kitten,‚Äù Lucas said. ‚ÄúHeater works. Stove‚Äôs good. Beds are‚Ä¶ functional. And best of all, it‚Äôs free. No hotels, no tents. Just us, the open road, and‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äú‚Äîthe smell of tetanus,‚Äù Emily interrupted, walking over with her mug.

‚ÄúIt does not smell like tetanus!‚Äù Lucas shot back, mock-offended.

‚ÄúDoes it have tires?‚Äù Anya asked, not bothering to hide her smirk anymore.

Lucas ignored her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious, guys. This is perfect. We‚Äôve been talking about a trip forever, right? Well, here it is. Northern Wisconsin, beautiful snow-covered campground. A proper camping trip.‚Äù

‚ÄúCamping trip?‚Äù I asked, setting my pen down. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre aware it‚Äôs December, right? In Wisconsin? With a major cold front coming in? People die doing this kind of stuff.‚Äù

Lucas waved me off. ‚ÄúOh, come on. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre climbing Everest. We‚Äôll park the RV, take some pictures, roast marshmallows. You‚Äôll thank me when you‚Äôre Instagram-famous.‚Äù

‚ÄúMark doesn‚Äôt even have Instagram,‚Äù Anya said.

‚ÄúExactly my point,‚Äù Lucas replied.

Emily sipped her coffee, eyeing him over the rim of her mug. ‚ÄúWhat happens if this ‚Äògreat‚Äô RV breaks down in the middle of nowhere?‚Äù

Lucas leaned back, crossing his arms. ‚ÄúThen I fix it. Easy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yeah,‚Äù Anya said, closing her laptop. ‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre such an expert mechanic.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know enough,‚Äù Lucas said defensively.

Emily looked at me. ‚ÄúWhat do you think, Mark?‚Äù

I hesitated. A part of me wanted to say no, but the way Lucas looked at me‚Äîhopeful, almost pleading‚Äîmade it hard. Plus, I couldn‚Äôt deny the idea of getting away for a while sounded nice.

I sighed. ‚ÄúFine. But if this RV dies, you‚Äôre walking back to town, not me.‚Äù

Lucas grinned. ‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù

\---------

The trip started out fine. Better than fine, actually. The road stretched out ahead of us, snow falling gently, dusting the trees and the narrow two-lane highway. The RV rattled every now and then, but Lucas seemed confident behind the wheel.

Anya‚Äôs dog Max sprawled out on the middle of the floor, snoring softly as Anya snapped photos from the passenger seat. Emily was in the back, organizing our supplies.

‚ÄúWho packed this much junk food?‚Äù She hollered out.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called being *prepared,*‚Äù I shouted back.

Lucas glanced at me in the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúJunk food? What happened to your ‚Äòhealth-is-wealth‚Äô mantra?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs *emergency* junk food,‚Äù I shot back.

Anya laughed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the kind of guy who brings Monopoly to a frat party, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is. Fun fact, Monopoly ruins friendships,‚Äù Lucas said, tapping on the steering wheel for emphasis.

‚ÄúOnly if you play wrong,‚Äù I said.

The teasing went on for a while, the kind of banter that comes out naturally when you‚Äôre with people you care about.

But a few hours into the trip, the first signs of trouble presented itself. It came from a sound: a low sputtering beneath the hum of the engine.

*Chug-chug-chug-thunk.*

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ what was that?‚Äù Emily asked, poking her head into the cabin.

Lucas frowned, tapping the dashboard. ‚ÄúProbably just the cold. Let me‚Äî‚Äù

*Clunk.* The RV shuddered and lurched to a stop.

Lucas swore under his breath and turned the key again. *Click-click-click.* Nothing.

‚ÄúLucas,‚Äù Anya said slowly, ‚Äúplease tell me you can fix this.‚Äù

He sighed, already pulling on his jacket. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably something minor. I‚Äôll check.‚Äù

He stepped outside, the door slamming shut behind him with a loud *thud.*¬†

A wisp of cold air from the outside dropped the temperature almost immediately. Anya zipped up her coat while Emily started digging out blankets.

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúNow what?‚Äù A glance out of the window only showed a slowly dissolving road with an endless mask of trees on either side.¬†

‚ÄúI guess we'll wait,‚Äù Emily said. ‚ÄúLucas‚Äôll figure it out.‚Äù

Max whined, his ears perked. The wind outside the RV continued to pick up, howling through the trees and whistling against the metal cabin.

Lucas came back inside after a crisp ten minutes, his boots dragging snow onto the linoleum floor. His face was flushed from the cold, but there was an uncharacteristic tightness in his jaw.

‚ÄúWell?‚Äù Emily asked, her voice edged with tension.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the fuel line,‚Äù Lucas said, shaking snow off his jacket. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs frozen solid. I don‚Äôt have the tools to fix it out here.‚Äù

Anya rubbed her hands together, blowing on them for warmth. ‚ÄúSo, what does that mean? We‚Äôre stuck?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor now,‚Äù Lucas admitted, glancing at me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call for help in the morning once there‚Äôs better light.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, why not call now?‚Äù I asked.

Lucas held up his phone, the screen showing a single, mocking bar of service. ‚ÄúWelcome to the middle of nowhere. I‚Äôll have to hoof it until I get reception.‚Äù

Emily groaned and slumped into the corner seat. ‚ÄúGreat. This is how every horror movie starts.‚Äù

‚ÄúRelax,‚Äù Lucas said, forcing a grin. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that bad. We‚Äôve got food, blankets, and each other. Worst-case scenario, we‚Äôll hike to a ranger station tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause hiking through a snowstorm is *so* much better,‚Äù Emily muttered, pulling her coat tighter around herself.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not storming yet,‚Äù Anya said, peering out the window. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just snowing lightly. Honestly, it‚Äôs kind of pretty.‚Äù

The rest of us followed her gaze. She wasn‚Äôt wrong‚Äîthe snow drifted down in soft, delicate flakes, coating the surrounding trees in white. The headlights illuminated the road ahead, empty and peaceful. For a moment, it was almost comforting.

Then Max started growling.

The sound was low and guttural, his ears pinned back as he stared at the door.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said softly, reaching to scratch behind his ears. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, boy?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt respond, just kept growling, his body tense like he was ready to lunge.

‚ÄúMaybe he heard an animal?‚Äù Anya suggested.

Emily frowned. ‚ÄúAn animal? Out here in the middle of winter? What would be dumb enough to wander around in this cold?‚Äù

Lucas stood and walked to the door, cracking it open just enough to stick his head outside. The sudden rush of cold made the rest of us shiver.

‚ÄúDo you see anything?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù he said, shutting the door quickly. ‚ÄúJust snow and trees.‚Äù

Max didn‚Äôt stop growling.

A couple of hours later, we started settling in for the night. Lucas and Emily rigged up a system of blankets and jackets to keep us warm, while Anya tried to coax Max into relaxing.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it,‚Äù she said, scratching his back. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs usually so calm on trips.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe he‚Äôs just picking up on our nerves,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúWhy is it so cold in here?‚Äù Emily said, settling into a corner with her arms crossed. ‚ÄúThe weather didn‚Äôt mention anything about it dropping below freezing.‚Äù

Lucas chuckled dryly. ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre totally helpless. We‚Äôve got camping supplies. If it keeps getting colder, we can light a fire outside.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd risk freezing to death faster?‚Äù Emily shot back.

‚ÄúWhat do you want me to say? It‚Äôs better than sitting in here and complaining.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you two not?‚Äù I said, cutting in before things got heated. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just focus on staying warm and figure the rest out in the morning.‚Äù

The tension broke slightly, but there was still an edge in the air. We sat in silence for a while, listening to the wind billow against the RV.

I took in a deep breath. I needed to get outside for a moment to unwind before trying to sleep. When I opened up the rear doors, I saw them.¬†

Footprints.

The snow outside was untouched except for a line of small, bare, childlike prints leading from the trees to the RV‚Äôs front door.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ guys?‚Äù I said, my voice soft.

Anya looked up first, her eyes squinting as she followed my gaze. ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù

Lucas walked over and glanced down. ‚ÄúFootprints?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre small,‚Äù I said.¬†

Emily joined us, choosing to peer out of the frosted window. ‚ÄúA kid? Out here? That doesn‚Äôt make any sense.‚Äù

We stared for a moment. The strange, meandering path of prints seemed completely unworried. They had stopped just short of the door. We didn't say anything, but we all noticed that none of the prints were leading away.

Max growled again from behind us, low and insistent, his nose pointed towards the open door.

Lucas shook his head. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs from an animal that just sort of *looks* like footprints. Snow can mess with shapes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Anya chirped in, unconvincingly.

No one wanted to admit what we were really thinking.

Deep in the treeline I thought I heard something. A faint floating sound. A laugh, high and breathy, like a breeze being swept through the trees.

‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù Emily whispered, her eyes wide.

Lucas nodded slowly. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

By the time the first light of dawn seeped through the trees, none of us had slept. Not properly, anyway. Emily had dozed off for a few minutes, her head slumped against the wall, but every creak of the RV made her snap to attention. Anya had stayed curled up with Max, one hand clutching his fur, the other pressed to her mouth searching for those hot little bursts of breath. Lucas sat yawning in the front seat, drumming his fingers on the steering wheel.

I didn't fare much better. I just stared out the window, watching as the snow piled higher and higher around us. The frost from the outside started to creep across the metal of the RV walls.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Lucas said eventually, clapping his hands together to break the stillness. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the plan. Mark and I head out, try to find the main road or a ranger station. Worst case, we flag someone down.‚Äù

Emily sat up sharply. ‚ÄúAre you serious? It's got to be in the double digits. And not on the positive side.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the alternative?‚Äù Lucas sighed. ‚ÄúWe just sit here and wait to freeze to death?‚Äù

Emily gestured at the iced-over windows. ‚ÄúYou think hiking through that is a better idea?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have to do something!‚Äù Lucas snapped, running a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúThe RV‚Äôs dead, the heater‚Äôs barely hanging on, and we can‚Äôt just‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúStop!‚Äù Anya‚Äôs voice cut through the argument. She looked pale, her eyes darting between us. ‚ÄúCan we please not fight right now? We‚Äôre all scared. Let‚Äôs think this through.‚Äù

Lucas exhaled, rubbing his temples. ‚ÄúFine. Ideas?‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúWhat about a fire? We‚Äôve got wood, matches. If we can melt some of this ice, maybe we can make the heater last longer.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not terrible,‚Äù Lucas admitted.

Emily crossed her arms. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better than splitting up and blindly wandering out into the storm.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Lucas said. ‚ÄúFire it is.‚Äù

The fire should‚Äôve helped.¬†

In theory, it should‚Äôve been simple: clear a spot in the snow, stack some wood, and let the flames do the rest. But the moment we stepped outside, the cold wrapped around us like a living thing. The wind needled its way through every layer we wore like they weren't even there.

‚ÄúGod,‚Äù Emily muttered, clutching her coat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs even colder than last night.‚Äù

When we hopped off of the back of the RV, our feet slid straight to the ground. The snow underfoot gave away too easily, falling away from our boots without compacting. It was like stepping into powdered ash. We didn't think too much about it though, Lucas and I were too focused on clearing a patch for the fire. It was easier than it should've been, like moving around fake snow from a TV set. It wasn't long before we had the wood and kindling set up.¬†¬†

Lucas brought the flame from the lighter down towards the pit.¬†

*Pfft*.¬†

The flame flickered and died before it got anywhere near the kindling. Lucas swore under his breath. He tried again. Same thing. The cold was getting worse.

‚ÄúHere, try this one.‚Äù Anya said, handing him another lighter.

Click. The flame barely lasted a second before a gust of wind swallowed it.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he muttered, fumbling with the switch.

‚ÄúMaybe we should just go back inside,‚Äù Anya said, her arms wrapped tightly around herself.

I was about to agree when I heard it: the faint, tinny sound of an old music box.

*Plink‚Ä¶* *plink-plunk*‚Ä¶ *plink‚Ä¶*

The melody was distant at first, almost delicate, as though it didn't want to interrupt us. It gently crept into the clearing between the trees, carried on the wind, growing louder with each note. Cheerful and steady, yet unmistakably off beat‚Äîlike a nursery rhyme slowed to a crawl.

We followed the noise towards an open strip of barren snow that used to be called a road. Then, through the treeline, we watched as a figure slid out into the open.

It wasn‚Äôt sudden. There was no jolt of shock, no moment of panic. It arrived as though it had every right to be there. And for a brief moment, we thought it might be someone who could help us.

The figure wore a long, black tailored coat, with a wide-brimmed hat that was tilted at an almost careless angle. But the face that was hidden beneath it was something that I wish I could forget.

It was smooth, pale, and polished. Not a single wrinkle on its head. Its features were just slightly off enough that it felt too close to being human‚Äîjust close enough to be wrong. The eyes were large and completely black, like carved pieces of polished coal. There was a faint, reflective shine to them that glimmered from the snow. Its nose was delicately thin, sharp and long, and the mouth‚Äîthin and uncomfortably wide‚Äîcurved upward in a slight performative smile.

It stopped in the middle of the road, placing one hand over its chest. Then, with a singular fluid motion, it bent over at the waist into a deep bow, its hat almost brushing against the snow.

None of us moved. We froze.

We watched as the figure straightened, reaching into its coat with a calm, precise motion. It withdrew something small, something metal that caught the pale light of the clearing.

A music box topped with a dancing ballerina.

Its long, gloved fingers shifted over to the crank, turning it slowly, deliberately. The melody twisted and warped with each turn, the sound becoming clearer and sharper as though it were summoning the air itself to attention. The ballerina began twirling.

Emily broke from her trance. She took a half-step backward, her boots crunching softly against the snow. The figure turned its head toward her, the motion unnervingly confident, the glint of its black eyes reflecting her movement.

It raised its arms up in a flourish. Then the children appeared.

They came one by one, stepping out from the treeline with an odd sort of playfulness, skipping and spinning as they emerged. Their bare feet left no marks in the snow.

I counted six, maybe seven children. Their silhouettes were half-obscured by the swirling snow.¬†

‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù Lucas breathed.

The figure raised one arm, a sharp, controlled gesture that froze the children in place. They stood there, still as statues, before their faces finally turned toward us.

Even through the snow, we could tell they were wrong. Their eyes were too small, their mouths too wide. Frost rimed their cheeks and hair, and their expressions never changed from anything other than excitement.

The figure tilted its head, as if inviting us to react to their little show.

‚ÄúInside,‚Äù I whispered, my voice dry.

Emily didn‚Äôt need to be told twice. She turned around and bolted toward the RV doors, pulling Anya with her. Lucas grabbed my arm, yanking me back as the figure took a single step forward, its footfall utterly silent.

We slammed the door shut behind us, fumbling with the lock until our stiffening fingers prevailed. Emily had already begun yanking the blinds closed.

Meanwhile the sound of the music box hadn‚Äôt¬† stopped.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù Emily stuttered out.

Lucas didn‚Äôt answer. He paced near the door, peeking through a crack in the blinds.

‚ÄúThey were‚Ä¶ kids,‚Äù Anya said softly, her voice distant. ‚ÄúDid everyone else see them?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey weren‚Äôt kids,‚Äù I muttered.

Max growled again from the lowest point in his throat, his hackles raised. The sound of his nails clicking back and forth in front of the door filled the cabin. We waited. Quiet. Hoping somehow it's to away.

But then came the knock.

It was a single, deliberate tap at the door.

We all turned to face it.

Another knock followed, calm and measured.

Max barked sharply, throwing himself against the door. His claws scratched at the metal, but the sound barely seemed to register over the rising tension.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù I whispered as Lucas moved toward the blinds.

He ignored me, pulling them back just enough to peek outside again. He froze, his face draining of color. He quickly took a step back.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Emily asked, her voice shaking.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs closer,‚Äù Lucas murmured.

I forced myself to look. Through the narrow gap in the blinds, I saw him. The man stood just outside the RV, his face tilted upward like it was admiring a painting.¬†

Behind him, the children had gathered. They stood in a loose semicircle, their heads tilted in unison, their wide, frozen eyes staring directly at the RV. It looked like they were about to sing a carol.

The man moved. Slowly, he reached out and adjusted the brim of his hat, then withdrew the music box again. His long fingers wound the crank with loving strokes. The melody shifted, the notes warping into a new tune, something higher, lighter. The children swayed gently.

One of them giggled.

It wasn‚Äôt loud, but it cut through the air like a blade, sharp and high-pitched. Another joined in, then another, their laughter blending with the music until it was impossible to tell where one sound ended and the other began.

‚ÄúWhat do they want?‚Äù Emily whispered, her back pressed against the far wall.

I didn‚Äôt answer. I couldn‚Äôt.

The figure tilted its head again, as if he had heard her question. Then, with a gentle motion, he raised a long finger and softly tapped against the frosted window, the sound crisp and deliberate.

Anya whimpered, curling into herself. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to come inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lucas said firmly. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt get in.‚Äù

The figure tapped the glass again, this time with more force. A spiderweb of frost began to spread outward from where his finger had pressed against the pane.

‚ÄúLucas,‚Äù I said, my throat hoarse. ‚ÄúStep back.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt move, his eyes locked on the frost as it crept across the window. The figure‚Äôs black eyes seemed to regard the frosted glass with amusement.

Then the music stopped, cutting off mid-note. The voice replaced it.

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you come outside?‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt loud, but it felt like it came from everywhere all at once. The voice was sharp, smooth, and‚Äîlayered. As though every word cracked into dozens of smaller voices.

Emily flinched, pressing her hands over her ears.

Lucas backed away from the door. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going anywhere,‚Äù he yelled, his voice shaking.

The figure dropped its head, almost as if it were in contemplation.¬†

Then with a single movement it turned the crank on the music box again, the melody resuming, now faster, harsher. The children began to move, their hands tapping softly against the RV, their eyes never the windows.

The frost on the glass began to spread inward like creeping vines.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming in,‚Äù Anya said, her voice flat.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lucas snapped, grabbing a knife from the counter. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not getting in here.‚Äù

The door rattled violently, the metal groaning under the strain. Max barked again, louder this time, throwing himself against the base of the door as though he could hold it closed.

The music swelled, filling every corner of the RV. The encroaching ice raced across the walls, the floor, the ceiling, encasing everything in a thin, brittle layer.

The door gave a final, shuddering rattle‚Äîand then it stopped.

The music cut off again.

We stood frozen, the silence almost unbearable. The frost-covered walls creaked softly, but nothing moved, nothing spoke.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gone,‚Äù Lucas said after a long moment.

Anya shook her head slowly.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still out there.‚Äù

The air inside grew colder with each passing second, crawling into our skin, our lungs, our bones. The frost wasn‚Äôt just on the walls anymore‚Äîit was covering us. A thin layer of ice clung to Lucas‚Äôs jacket, to Emily‚Äôs hair, and even to Max‚Äôs fur. It spread with a controlled sluggishness.

I noticed my fingers first. They tingled, then turned numb. I flexed them, trying to shake it off, but the stiffness didn‚Äôt go away. My gloves felt like they weren‚Äôt there anymore, as if the cold had seeped straight through the fabric right into the flesh.

‚ÄúWe need to move,‚Äù Lucas muttered, his voice trembling. He tried to walk, but his knees buckled, and he slumped onto the kitchen seat.

‚ÄúLucas?‚Äù Emily‚Äôs voice cracked. ‚ÄúAre you‚Äîare you okay?‚Äù She took a step towards him. Her lips were cracked and purple. Her cheeks had already lost all their color.¬†

Lucas didn‚Äôt reply, just stared at his hands. His gloves were frozen stiff, the fabric cracking as he tried to flex his fingers. He peeled one off, and I gagged.

His fingertips were white, almost translucent, with deep, angry cracks that bled sluggishly. The skin along his knuckles had split open, exposing raw, purple flesh beneath.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt feel them,‚Äù he said, his voice distant. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt feel anything.‚Äù

Emily whimpered, pulling her own hands close to her chest.

I tried to speak, but my lips wouldn‚Äôt move right. My tongue felt thick and uncoordinated, like it was stuck to the roof of my mouth. I reached up, brushing at my face, and froze.

My cheek was hard to the touch, the skin taut and unyielding. My breath came in short, shallow bursts, barely fogging the air, and when I exhaled, I saw tiny flecks of ice falling from my lips.

‚ÄúMark‚Ä¶‚Äù Anya‚Äôs voice was faint, barely audible. She was still sitting by the window, her arms wrapped around Max, who was lying unnaturally still. Her face was pale, her eyes glassy, and her breath came in weak, uneven gasps.

She looked down at Max, her hands trembling. His fur was matted with frost, his nose coated in a thin layer of ice. His chest didn‚Äôt rise.

‚ÄúMax?‚Äù Anya whispered, shaking him gently. ‚ÄúMax, come on. Wake up.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt move.

Her trembling turned violent, and she let out a strangled cry, pressing her face into his frozen fur. ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Ä¶‚Äù

The sound snapped something in me. I stumbled toward her, my legs barely cooperating, every step sending sharp jolts of pain up my frozen feet. I knelt beside her, reaching out, but she flinched away, clutching Max tighter.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre freezing,‚Äù Emily said suddenly, her voice sharp and slurred. Her teeth chattered violently, her body shaking. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre‚Äîwe‚Äôre freezing to death.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lucas muttered, his voice thick. His eyes sluggishly flitted around the RV. ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre not. We‚Äîwe can‚Äôt be. We‚Äôre inside. The heats on‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre dying.‚Äù Emily murmured under her broken breath.

Her words hung in the air, sharp and jagged.

I staggered back to my feet, grabbing the edge of the counter for support. My head was spinning, my vision blurred at the edges, and my heart felt like it was slowing.

Then I saw it.

The frost on the window had cleared, just enough to reveal a single black eye staring in. My breath caught in my throat. The man‚Äôs face was pressed against the glass, its lips pulled into that faint, thin smile.

It blinked once, slowly, almost lazily.¬†

Emily sobbed, fully collapsing onto the floor. ‚ÄúWhy is it watching us? Why‚Äôs it just watching?‚Äù

Lucas began to laugh, a low, strained sound that turned into a cough. He wheezed, his breath rattling. ‚ÄúIs‚Äîis it getting warmer in here?‚Äù

The creature‚Äôs black eyes shifted slightly, locking onto me. It raised one gloved hand and tapped gently on the glass, the sound soft but punctual.

My body convulsed involuntarily, my limbs jerking as I tried to move, to run, to do anything. But I couldn‚Äôt look away from those eyes‚Äîblack and endless, swallowing everything they saw.

I sank to the floor, my strength draining away.¬†

We were freezing, and it was waiting.

Anya stirred first. Her movements were slow, almost hesitant, as though she were waking from a dream. She didn‚Äôt say anything‚Äîshe just stood up, staring down at Max‚Äôs frozen body with a strange, distant look on her face.

‚ÄúAnya,‚Äù I whispered, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt respond. Her trembling hands slid under Max‚Äôs stiff body, and with a strength I didn‚Äôt think she had left, she lifted him into her arms. The frost cracked and splintered as his limbs shifted.

‚ÄúAnya, stop,‚Äù Emily rasped, her voice faint and broken. ‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù

But Anya didn‚Äôt listen. She stood unsteadily, her legs shaking beneath her, and turned toward the door.

‚ÄúAnya, no.‚Äù Lucas reached out, but his body was weak, the effort made him cough violently.

She didn‚Äôt look back. Her pale, frostbitten hands fumbled with the lock, the metal screeching softly as it turned. The door creaked open, and the cold rushed in.

‚ÄúAnya, please!‚Äù I tried to stand again, but my legs gave out beneath me, sending me sprawling onto the frozen floor. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go out there!‚Äù

She hesitated in the doorway, the wind catching her hair and tossing it around her face like brittle threads. For a moment, she looked back at us.

Her eyes were strange. Glassy. Almost‚Ä¶ peaceful.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be warm soon.‚Äù

Then she stepped outside, the door swinging shut behind her with a hollow clang.

\---------

With all my strength I pulled myself up to a window. Through the frost-covered glass, I watched as Anya carried Max into the clearing. Her movements were slow and mechanical, her head bowed against the wind. The snow swirled around her, fluttering in strange, erratic patterns.

The creature watched her approach, its black eyes glinting with faint amusement.

The children walked towards her, swaying with every step, their smiles widening.

Anya sank to her knees in the snow, cradling Max‚Äôs body. Her breath came in short, shallow bursts, fogging the air around her face. I watched as frost crept up her arms, her legs, her cheeks, but she didn‚Äôt move.

The creature stepped forward, its coat billowing slightly in the wind. It crouched low, its movements precise and deliberate, and extended a hand toward Anya.

Her breathing slowed. Her head tilted upward, her glassy eyes locking onto the creature‚Äôs face.

I don‚Äôt know if she took its hand, or if it just hovered there, but she smiled‚Äîjust for a moment‚Äîbefore her body slumped forward. Her arms went limp, and Max‚Äôs frozen body fell into the snow beside her.

I slumped down against the RV walls and closed my eyes. When I managed to open them again, I noticed how far the ice had advanced. It had crawled up the walls, pooled in the corners, and spread like veins across the floor.¬†

Emily was curled up on the floor, her head pulled to the side, her lips stained a deep, unnatural blue. Her breaths were faint‚Äîso faint they seemed to stop at times before resuming with a shallow wheeze.

But Lucas, Lucas wasn‚Äôt breathing at all. His body sat rigid in the seat, his head bowed forward as though in deep contemplation. His face was gaunt, the pale skin stretched tightly over his cheekbones, while his hands were frozen mid-clench like sprawling claws. His eyes were wide and glossy, staring through a layer of frost.¬†

Emily‚Äôs shallow breathing eventually fully slowed. Her chest rose and fell with longer pauses in between, her face slack, her eyelids fluttering before sinking shut. Whatever part of her was still fighting to stay conscious was losing.¬†

I couldn‚Äôt look at her anymore. I could feel the same numbness creeping over me, a heaviness pulling me under. It wasn‚Äôt sudden; it was maddeningly slow, creeping into my head until the edges of my vision softened. My hands no longer felt like mine. I tried to lift them, to reach for something‚Äîanything‚Äîbut they stayed limp at my sides.

The world around me dimmed, retreating into a strange, hazy fog. The shapes in the RV grew indistinct.

The door creaked.

The sound sliced through the fog, jarring and unnatural. I forced my eyes to focus, but it felt like trying to see through a frozen lens. The door had opened. The man stepped inside.

He moved with unhurried care, his boots were soundless against the slick floor. I couldn‚Äôt turn my head to follow him, but I saw him out of the corner of my eye, tall and angular, the brim of his hat brushing against the low ceiling. His presence filled the room like a heavy weight.

He passed by me without a glance, his gaze fixed on Emily. He stopped beside her, leaning down slowly, his face close to hers. Those black, glinting eyes studied her slack expression like they were looking beneath her skin.

And then the man turned toward me.

He smiled, just slightly, just enough.

I tried to move, to scream, to do anything, but I was a spectator trapped in my own body. My breath caught in my throat, frozen along with the rest of me. All I could do was meet its gaze.

Then the headlights hit.

A sudden, blinding flash of light cut through the RV. My vision burned white, and for a moment, I thought I heard the creature‚Äôs footsteps falter.

When the spots cleared from my eyes, it was gone.

The door swung open, the snow swirling violently outside, but there was no trace of the figure, no sign it had ever been there. My mind finally slipped. 

\---------

I woke to the soft beeping of a heart monitor and the rhythmic hiss of an oxygen mask. The hospital room was sterile and bright. I noticed that my body felt heavy and strange, stiff like it wasn‚Äôt entirely mine.¬†

A nurse stood at my bedside, adjusting something on an IV stand. She turned when she noticed my eyes open, her expression softening with relief.

‚ÄúWelcome back,‚Äù she said quietly, offering a faint smile.

I tried to speak, but my throat was raw. ‚ÄúWater.‚Äù

She handed me a cup, and I drank, the liquid seared its way down my throat. It hurt, but at least it felt like something.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Emily?‚Äù I asked, my voice rasping.

Her expression shifted, her smile fading into something more careful. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs next door,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs stable, but‚Ä¶ not awake yet.‚Äù

I nodded, closing my eyes briefly. Emily was alive. That was enough.

\---------

The hours blurred together, my body trapped in a haze of pain and exhaustion. When I finally had the strength to sit up, I asked to see Emily.

The doctor hesitated but eventually agreed, guiding me slowly down the hall. My legs felt unsteady beneath me, my steps dragging against the polished floor.

When I reached her room, I stopped in the doorway.

Emily looked impossibly small in the hospital bed, her pale face almost blending into the stark white of the sheets. Her chest rose and fell faintly, and the machines around her beeped steadily, indifferent to how fragile she looked.

I hesitated, then shuffled forward and sat beside her. Her skin had the same off-color pallor as mine‚Äîlike the frost had left a stain. I watched her breathe, each rise and fall of her chest a small reassurance that she was still here, still alive.

After a while her eyes fluttered open. She squinted against the light, then turned her head to me. Her lips parted in a faint smile.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake,‚Äù I said, my voice hoarse. The relief that flooded through me was almost enough to push the other feelings away.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she murmured, her voice rough and weak. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre alive.‚Äù

She nodded slowly, but there was no relief in her expression. Her gaze drifted past me, out of focus, like she was looking through the walls.

‚ÄúFor now,‚Äù she whispered.

I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I turned my attention to the window, watching the snow swirl against the glass.

Then the TV sputtered on.

The sound cut through the silence with a sudden, violent hiss of static. I flinched, turning toward the corner of the room where the screen glowed faintly. No one had touched the remote.

‚ÄúDid you turn it on?‚Äù I asked Emily. My voice sounded far away.

She shook her head weakly.

The screen flickered again, the static thick and noisy, lines of distortion rippling through the image. For a moment, nothing happened‚Äîit was just chaos on the screen, noise clawing at our ears.

Then the static shifted, and the picture began to clear.

Shapes emerged‚Äîfaint, shadowy figures moving within the gray haze. A slow, warped melody played faintly in the background, growing louder as the picture sharpened.

The tune was familiar. A song from a 70‚Äôs TV special.

*‚ÄúIf you try to turn around, When you hear his icy sound‚Ä¶‚Äù*

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Emily whispered. Her voice was barely audible, but I saw the fear in her wide, glassy eyes.

The song continued, each word sharper and more distorted, crawling out of the speakers.

*‚ÄúHe‚Äôs sure to disappear, But you know, yes, you know‚Ä¶‚Äù*

The screen glitched violently, the shapes twisting and contorting. For a moment, I thought I saw something‚Äîa figure standing still in the static, its dark form motionless, its wide-brimmed hat unmistakable.

*‚ÄúThen you know Jack Frost is here.‚Äù*

The screen went black.

‚ÄúTurn it off,‚Äù Emily rasped.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already off,‚Äù I said.

Emily stared at the blank screen, her breaths shallow and uneven. Her lips trembled as she spoke.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not gone,‚Äù she said, her voice rattling. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never going to leave.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. My eyes were still locked on the TV, waiting for the static to return.

**1. The Overachiever Supreme:**  
The AP-taking, club-leading, volunteering virtuoso who fills every second with productivity. Their essay is polished like a diamond but feels a little ""too rehearsed"" to them. They end up at their top choice and caption their acceptance post, *‚ÄúI‚Äôm in disbelief!‚Äù* (They‚Äôre not).

**2. The Procrastination Prodigy:**  
Thinks deadlines are more of a suggestion. Starts the essay at 2 a.m., fueled by coffee and sheer panic. Somehow churns out gold under pressure. Applies to a dozen schools in one caffeine-fueled frenzy and wakes up wondering what they wrote. Ends up getting accepted and shrugs it off like, *‚ÄúI had a feeling.‚Äù*

**3. The Prestige Purist:**  
Only has eyes for the Ivy League, Stanford, or MIT. Talks about *fit* but means *ranking*. Scoffs at the thought of ""backup schools"" until those rejection emails roll in. Ends up at their safety and secretly thrives but tells everyone it was their ‚Äúplan all along.‚Äù

**4. The Multiverse Explorer:**  
Conflicted between becoming a novelist, marine biologist, or CEO. Applies to wildly different programs‚Äîfrom liberal arts colleges to specialized tech schools. Their essays feel like multiple personalities vying for the spotlight. Eventually picks a path and finds it wasn‚Äôt even on their original list.

**5. The Storyteller Extraordinaire:**  
Turns their personal statement into a Pulitzer-worthy narrative. Writes about overcoming a challenge, a quirky passion, or a life-altering moment that could be a Netflix special. Gets mixed results but handles both acceptance and rejection with grace, wisdom, and a social media-worthy quote.

**6. The Chill Optimizer:**  
Researches colleges like they‚Äôre comparison shopping online. Applies to a curated list of realistic options, writes essays that are solid but not overdone, and stays calm through the process. Ends up happy wherever they land and somehow always finds the best campus coffee shop.

**7. The Parental Puppet:**  
Doesn‚Äôt know what they want because their parents have decided for them. Applies to schools their family thinks are impressive and writes essays heavily edited by *‚Äúhelpful‚Äù* relatives. Gets in, but spends the first semester questioning everything.

**8. The Underdog with Grit:**  
Doesn‚Äôt have the fanciest resume but has heart. Writes a raw, authentic essay about their journey and hustles hard to make their application shine. Gets into a solid school and works their way to the top, proving everyone wrong along the way.

**9. The One-and-Done Maverick:**  
Applies early decision to their dream school and bets it all on one application. Pours their soul into the essay, hits submit, and then nervously waits. Gets in and rides the wave of relief‚Äîor doesn‚Äôt and scrambles to submit applications to their backup schools last minute.

**10. The Chaos Theorist:**  
Forgets deadlines, mixes up applications, or sends the wrong essay to the wrong school. Somehow manages to pull it together at the last minute and surprises everyone, including themselves, when they get in somewhere amazing.

Strattera is easier to find, maybe I‚Äôll go with that. Last time I had mixed results. Who knows.

Without meds, I‚Äôm like a sloth. I‚Äôm sloooow. I‚Äôm tired. I don‚Äôt want to do anything. I‚Äôm bored all the time. It‚Äôs not depression; I tried that. I got misdiagnosed for years. Antidepressants are terrible for me.

I think I‚Äôm severely understimulated all the time? What else can I do?

Things I‚Äôm doing/trying:

- Eating three meals a day, protein heavy-ish
- Chugging so much water
- Sleeping around 7 hours every day
- Supplements: vitamin D, all sorts of magnesium, prebiotics & probiotics, vitamin B with zinc
- Weightlifting once a week. Maybe once every 10 days. Just got a kettlebell
- Averaging 4000 steps a day
- Coffee, once or twice a day, only when I‚Äôm not medicated
- Blood tests came clean. I had hypoglacemia but I mostly dealt with it.

Limitations:
- I‚Äôm broke. Working on it
- I don‚Äôt have much space at home",1,1734275340.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False

I‚Äôm new to Vyvanse & was hoping to gain insight from a community. I‚Äôve been a major lurker for months before posting, so plz be nice to me lol üôÉü•≤

I was put on Vyvanse after seeing a psychiatrist for a few months, *officially* diagnosed w/ adult ADHD (along w/ SAD & GAD) & with not much help on Wellbutrin in terms of managing my inattention.

I‚Äôve been titrating in increments of 10mg:

10mg- starter dose; felt like a sugar pill & a waste of money since my insurance doesn‚Äôt cover Vyvanse > Adderall. 

20mg- like a light cup of coffee

30mg- better, can feel the effects more markedly compared to 20mg, but sometimes doesn‚Äôt last 12hrs. 

*I‚Äôve discussed this w/ my psychiatrist & have been upped to 40mg; haven‚Äôt started yet (backordered due to shortage). 

*However in the meantime, I wanted to know what everyone‚Äôs routine is with Vyvanse?*

I‚Äôve only been on 30mg consistently so far (~3wks).  On some days it lasts the full 12hrs & then some, while on other days I feel like I‚Äôm able to sneak in a mid-day nap. Like a lot of people on here, I set an AM alarm (5-7am, depending on when I want to start my day) to take it & it gets me out of bed ~2hrs later. On the contrary, I‚Äôve experimented w/ taking it @10am, & couldn‚Äôt sleep until way past midnight‚Ä¶

I thought maybe food played a factor as to my experience with its inconsistencies (I read some on here wait 30min-1hr before/after a high-protein breakfast). I asked the pharmacist if I should be taking it before or after breakfast & she told me it didn‚Äôt matter, as it doesn‚Äôt affect its efficacy. (I also avoid any citrus after taking it.)

Got into leftist politics to... Do something. After a decade, I'm so disappointed in you.

what do I find? Adults acting like children. Terminally online people who go on about blowing stuff up but never do so much as hand over food to a food bank, instead it's the endless talking...endlessly discussing every little thing forever and ever and ever...kidding ourselves that a bunch of people who couldn't point out Syria on a map of Syria are successfully elevating anyone's political consciousness.

But that's just online, right? All the terminally online weirdos who think direct action is yelling at some random for not knowing the latest thing that they only just read about themselves on twitter. Or it's the children going around calling everyone they can 'bootlicker' and 'liberal' because this isn't about revolution for them... It's just another excuse to be shitty to strangers online.

Real life is where the action is. That's where the real movement is. That had to be where people who want to do something actually are.

Unfortunately, I was wrong. It was mostly anarchists breaking into places to hold 'conferences' were EVERYTHING is discussed to the point where all words have lost their meaning just in time for when everyone eats all the mdma in the world and start making even less sense

 or it was weirdly quiet men selling self published newspapers that still cling to the words of dead-for-century's Europeans that in their time were the most relevant things ever written but now.... The world has become so much weirder than any of them could have imagined. Had anyone thought to tell the Marxist Leninists this?

This was worse than the online stuff!  Because this was people's attempts at trying. And it was all total shit.

An anarchist book fayre which nobody in their right mind would go to unless they were already in the ""movement"" or a meeting where only two other people showed up, and it ends with an argument about the stupid shit happening online!

None of it was combatanting any number of the toxic trends our world is following to it's death...it was self congratulatory crap for finding a new, exciting was to explain why capitalism is bad.... Let's crack another warehouse! Let's go sit in another shit building talking about how maybe in the future we will figure out how to replace the 2 billions worth of imported coffee the UK gets a year... Actually no.... Maybe we should tell people to give up coffee! That is how we will sell the post capitalist utopia! By actually having some kind of answer to the inevitable questions after you open with your amazing sales pitch ""capitalism is bad because it hurts people you have never met or seen and it's hurting you too and also maybe all your favourite things Will no longer be something you can have but we don't know for sure, come join us at our conference in the old office block""

Can't really blame you lot for that because leaving capitalism for whatever comes next, it's going to be a disaster. Millions dead. Not because of the ideas, because as hard as it is to believe this... I'm one of you... But because I wouldn't trust any of you with a revolution because starting the class war the right way round should have been the easiest thing in the world and you failed at it. 

""You know that wallmart that came to town, sucked all the money and resources out of our town after it killed all our businesses and it sent all the towns money to the Cayman Islands where it will sit until some billionaire nobody has ever heard of decides to use it to destroy another, previously clean and beautiful area in the global South"".

How hard is that to say to somebody? How hard is that to say to explain that maybe other screwed over people's aren't the problem?

Why is leftist thought seemingly a rush to over complicate everything instead of trying to find the best way to explain it to all the working class people who are voting for actual fascists at this point.

But nobody ever thinks of that stuff do they? The real hard things like... HOW. HOW ARE WE GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS TO PEOPLE SO THEY START DEALING WITH THIS. 

HOW ARE WE GOING TO STOP THE MOST EVIL PEOPLE WHO HAVE EVER LIVED FROM SELLING EVERYTHING THAT DOES AND DOESN'T EXIST TO US UNTIL WE ARE CHOCKING ON THE FUMES OF WHAT USED TO BE WHEREVER WE ARE LIVING.

It's always the same. Arguments over NOTHING whilst people try to show off how based they are with how many little grenade emojis they tweeted at fucking wallmart whilst doing nothing except what they think will get them plaudits.

And then there is the total shut down of actually trying to SELL THE IDEAS. The attempts made appear to be totally incomprehensible to most people and nobody can blame the media for that. When we start talking about our ideas it's faux-achademia laced crap.

You want to know why the far right is winning? And don't you dare blame liberalis and their media for your failures. 

The far right are winning because around a million years ago they worked out that to get people on side you have to come up with something that makes some kind of sense at the word level. 

Everyone understands ""want to know why your live is worse? It's this minority groups fault""

Nobody understands ""the ruling class have done THIS""

WHO? ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT BILLIONAIRES? POLITICIANS? WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

what are their names? What did they do? Why was it bad... Oh look youre already tweeting about how based it was that CEO got killed.

I know anarchism struggles because the whole thing can be summed up as ""being absolutely right about almost everything whilst not having a single answer on how to change anything"" whilst to most people communism is basically just genocides and stupid moustaches...

What is wrong with us? We are RIGHT about so much, and yet we kid ourselves about trying to save the world by doing... What exactly. 

Kidding ourselves that this, posting on socials , endlessly talking, shitting on liberals all day...

Well you know what? They won because they DID SOMETHING.

Something that wasn't the same tired stupid shit monty python was taking the piss out of us for 50 years ago! 


Someone is going to reply saying that it isn't fair to judge them because the system is rigged. 

Of course it's rigged! You claim to want the end of nation states, capitalism, all of that but you think it's unfair that they don't want you doing that, therefore you aren't getting anywhere...

(should I move on)?,"I \[34M\] have a friend I've known for years, who is about 10 years younger than me \[22F\]. At one point, we flirted online for a while, but outside of that period, we‚Äôve always been close.

Last year, we briefly considered going on a date. However, at the last moment, I backed out because I wasn‚Äôt sure about her feelings for me. After I backed out, she told me about her plans with three other guys, including me. I felt turned off and uncomfortable because it seemed disrespectful to me, and I found myself getting jealous. We argued, and she blocked me. Before blocking me, she mentioned she was about to sleep with someone else. She had always shared details about her dates and relationships with various guys before, but this was the first time she had shared something so intimate about herself with me.

I don‚Äôt think she was trying to take revenge on me; she just liked sharing things. However, during the time she blocked me, I became obsessed with her. Our friendship chemistry had always been great, but I was the one who always had emotional and physical expectations. Sometimes, she would act very close to me‚Äîshe even sent me nudes at times‚Äîbut shortly afterward, she‚Äôd pull away.

During the period when I was fixated on her, I blamed myself a lot. I wanted to fix our friendship, so I wrote her poems, called her multiple times, and tried to reconnect. Eventually, when she broke up with her boyfriend, she came back into my life and told me she missed me. For a moment, I felt excited, like everything was reset.

At one point, when we were both single, I decided to meet her in person without any expectations, just to experience something I‚Äôd always wondered about. We met, spent quality time together, and even kissed a few times. We didn‚Äôt go all the way, but when she came to my hotel room, she sat on my lap and hugged me. When I tried to initiate something more intimate, her eyes welled up with tears. She wanted to leave, but she didn‚Äôt. In that moment, I accepted that she cared about me but didn‚Äôt fully want me in that way. I didn‚Äôt push her into anything. We had already had a great time, and I thought keeping this positive momentum was the best thing for both of us. We ended the night with a coffee outing.

Afterward, I returned to my home in another city. We were both happy, but I started getting lost in various fantasies. I began wondering if our friendship could evolve into a relationship. However, when I reflected on the past, I remembered how, even though she enjoyed communicating with me, she had been¬†**disrespectful**¬†at times. I also couldn‚Äôt be sure how much she actually liked me.

Around 10-15 days ago, she told me she had met a new guy and that there was a strong possibility they would start dating. Because of this, she said she wouldn‚Äôt be able to interact with me the way she used to. I avoided discussing this because I couldn‚Äôt accept it, and naturally, she stopped sharing details with me as well.

A week ago, she told me that they had officially become a couple. She even asked me for hotel recommendations for them. At that moment, something clicked in my brain. I felt jealous but didn‚Äôt lash out at her. Instead, I decided to open up about my feelings.

I told her plainly that I loved her and wanted to be with her. She responded by saying she already knew, that she cared about me, but she didn‚Äôt want to be with me. Then, she said something that completely broke me:

*""Do you really think there‚Äôs any chance I‚Äôll ever like you in the future? That‚Äôs impossible. I‚Äôve never liked you, and I never will.""*

This was devastating for me. Just two months ago, we had gotten so close, and I felt, even if she was hesitant, that she did have feelings for me. Hearing¬†*‚ÄúI‚Äôll never like you‚Äù*¬†felt like a cruel blow. I had done so much for her and truly loved her. Not only was she unwilling to give me a chance, but I felt she was lying when she said she never had feelings for me. Just two months ago, we had kissed, six months ago, we were planning our first date, last year we had flirted online.

I told her that I didn‚Äôt care about the past or what she had said; my feelings for her wouldn‚Äôt change. I admitted that even though I loved communicating with her as a friend, I couldn‚Äôt stop liking her. My heart wanted her, no matter what.

In response, she blocked me again. She said it was never going to happen.

After she blocked me, I reached out to her from a different number. I suggested we talk like two mature adults. She unblocked me, but she said it wasn‚Äôt right for her to talk to me while she was in a relationship, especially knowing I still had feelings for her. Honestly, I agreed with her and told her I wouldn‚Äôt try to contact her while she was in a relationship. I also said, apart from that (meaning if she wasn‚Äôt in a relationship), she could always write to me whenever she wanted.

She told me I was very selfish and that I always did things I regretted afterward. She also said that the idea of her reaching out to me again was an¬†**impossible dream**. Her final words hurt me deeply. I also felt very unsettled by her erratic behavior. While she had valid points in some areas, her words were harsh and, at times, even untrue.

As a man, I‚Äôve always thought about this: the closeness I shared with her felt unique to me, something special and meaningful. But now, I wonder if she ever truly valued it the same way I did. Did she see it as just casual fun, while I attached deeper significance to it?

There were moments when she seemed genuinely close to me, even vulnerable. But her actions and words often contradicted that. For instance, she would send mixed signals‚Äîbeing warm and intimate one moment, then cold and distant the next.

It makes me question whether she ever truly respected our connection or my feelings. She openly admitted she knew I loved her and wanted to get closer, yet she always expected me to remain a listening ear for her chaotic and unstable relationships with other guys. Whenever I resisted or refused, she would label me as selfish.

I struggled to navigate a friendship with her, nor could I convince her to give us a real chance at dating. I suffered a lot in the process.

She is always too harsh on me. Yes, I admit I‚Äôm obviously jealous, which might come across as emotionally weak. But don‚Äôt I deserve better from her? She knows how deeply I love her. At times, my feelings did feel obsessive, I‚Äôll admit that‚Äîbut they were never abusive.

Now, I‚Äôd like to ask for advice,

TL;DR: Do you think this girl is being disrespectful to me? And if so, should I let this go entirely because of that?

I genuinely care about her as a person and always felt we got along well. I was happy when we flirted, too. But her inconsistent behavior has been emotionally exhausting for me.

I sometimes feel like I should try to revive our communication by doing things that would make her happy, but for the first time ever, I feel truly insignificant in her eyes.

Her words about me, like ""never was, never will"" and ""impossible,"" felt incredibly harsh. I cried afterward.",0,1734273985.0,relationships,40,0.3,False

I figured the Christmas break would be the best time to try.

I'm 44 and have been a smoker for 26 years‚Äîmy whole adult life. I smoke 16‚Äì20 roll-your-own cigarettes a day. I've tried to quit many times using patches, vaping, hypnotherapy, and the Allen Carr book, but nothing has worked for me. In fact, I now spend more time smoking than ever and feel beyond sick and tired of it. I'm miserable and frustrated with myself.

I quit regular cigarettes about five years ago but switched to roll-your-own tobacco. Worst decision ever‚Äîit feels twice as addictive! Now, I often need two cigarettes at a time, and each session takes half an hour. Smoking eats up so much of my time. I'm sick of rolling them; it‚Äôs exhausting. Smoking, nicotine, and my routine are so ingrained in my life that I‚Äôm terrified of the withdrawals. I smoke so much that I barely even experience cravings anymore. Cutting back hasn‚Äôt worked for me.

But now, the time has come. I need and want to quit. Financially, I can‚Äôt afford it anymore, and I don‚Äôt want to waste any more of my time smoking and rolling.

This time, I‚Äôve stocked up on Nicorette spray, patches, lozenges, and a nicotine inhaler. I plan to use the patches and QuickMist spray.

However, I have a severe phobia of side effects, which makes me hesitant to try the lozenges and spray. I‚Äôm leaning toward the spray because I‚Äôve read a lot of success stories, and it seems like the best fit for me. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs more addictive than smoking and other NRTs, but I don‚Äôt care‚ÄîI‚Äôd just be so happy and grateful to not be a smoker anymore. I can always wean off it later. My main concern with the spray is mouth burning.

The challenges I fear most when quitting are lack of focus, brain fog, insomnia, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and being so drained I literally can‚Äôt get out of bed. I‚Äôm also scared of constipation (I‚Äôve been hospitalized for it before) and missing my morning routine of cigarettes and coffee, which helps me wake up and go to the toilet. These last three concerns are the biggest for me. I take Movicol, so maybe I could increase the dose if needed.

How can I make it stick this time and let go of my morning routine?
How can I overcome my fear of withdrawals and successfully quit?

Any advice on how to prepare for and get through the first seven days would mean so much.

P.S. Thank you in advance for any advice, and I apologize if I‚Äôm slow to reply! üôè",8,1734273547.0,quittingsmoking,9,1.0,False

# üö© Red Flags of a Fake Sugar Daddy

# Unverifiable Background Info

If your sugar daddy's background feels like a mystery novel, it‚Äôs time to dig deeper. Fake photos and sketchy profiles? Classic scam moves. I‚Äôve seen profiles with stock photos and zero followers‚Äîmajor red flag. Do a reverse image search to see if his face pops up on some stock photo site.

# Vague & Evasive Chat

If he's dodging questions like Neo in the Matrix, be wary. Poor grammar, avoiding specifics about his life‚Äîthese are signs he‚Äôs hiding more than just his intentions. I once asked a guy about his ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù and he threw flattery my way instead of answers. Nope, not today!

# Asking for Personal Info

If he‚Äôs fishing for your personal deets like login info or credit card numbers, run. I‚Äôve had guys try to ‚Äúbuild trust‚Äù by asking for sensitive data. Trust me, real sugar daddies don‚Äôt need to play CIA with your info.

# No Face-to-Face Meetings

If he‚Äôs all digital and no IRL, that‚Äôs fishy. Genuine sugar daddies want to meet up, not just text forever. If he‚Äôs always got an excuse to stay online, he‚Äôs probably hiding something‚Äîor someone.

# Extravagant Promises with Zero Proof

Promises of yachts and private jets? Sounds dreamy, but if there‚Äôs no proof, it‚Äôs likely a scam. I‚Äôve had promises of the world only to find they couldn‚Äôt even send a simple gift. Real sugar daddies back it up with action.

# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Tools to Verify Authenticity

# Background Check Services

For serious suitors, background checks are your friend. Sites like Instant Checkmate let you peek behind the curtain. I‚Äôve saved myself drama and heartache by vetting those too-good-to-be-true profiles.

# Reverse Image Search

See a pic that seems too polished? Google‚Äôs reverse image search can show if it‚Äôs been swiped from elsewhere. I once found a ‚Äúwealthy entrepreneur‚Äù using a stock photo of a model‚Äîbusted!

# üí° Pro Tips to Stay Safe

# Set Boundaries

Decide your limits and stick to them. Real sugar daddies respect this. If he‚Äôs pushing you to bend your rules, he‚Äôs not worth your time.

# Protect Your Info

Keep your personal details close to the vest. Use app messaging features to keep convos safe and traceable. I‚Äôve avoided impersonation scams by sticking to in-app chats.

# Meet in Public

For first meetings, pick a bustling cafe or restaurant. Public places mean safety, and you can make a quick exit if things get weird. A casual coffee date helped me gauge one guy‚Äôs intentions without feeling trapped.

# üö® Handling Scams

# Spotting Fakes

Trust your gut. If his profile is sketchy or his messages feel off, cut ties. I‚Äôve learned to trust my instincts‚Äîthey‚Äôre usually spot on.

# Reporting Scams

Report sketchy behavior on the app ASAP. Include all the juicy details to help the platform boot the fraudsters. It‚Äôs about keeping the community safe for everyone.

Sugar dating can be rewarding, but only if you keep your wits about you. Trust your instincts, verify everything, and you‚Äôll dodge the fake sugar daddies like a pro. Stay safe out there, and may your sugar be sweet and scam-free! üç≠",1,1734273494.0,CyberCupid,0,1.0,False

Ever since then I feel she stopped being interested in spending time with me. Previously we would see each other ever week or once in two weeks at minimum, sometimes we would see each other every day in the school library (we are both students at the same university) and go hang out for lunch or coffee. Now we  hardly meet at all. We don't spend time together at the apartment, no common lunches, breakfast or anything. I have tried reaching out to her several times and always got rejected, while she does not reach out to me at all.

A month ago, I have tried to have a conversation about this with her, saying that I feel like our friendship has become onesided and asking whether there was some sort of issue with the co-habitation. She admitted not putting in any energy but claimed it was because she was busy and strugggling financially (she has recently started at new job and was still in the unpaid training) but promised to put in more energy. During that conversation she has invited me to join her and her boyfriend at a concert. I went and it was lovely but ever since then the friendship went back to the previous stage of me reaching out to be rejected and her never reaching out.

I find her claim that she is not reaching out merely out due to lack of time and money odd because I see regularly her ig stories in which she goes out to party with her other friend or her boyfriend and I know that she has recently planned a Christmas trip with a group of friends to a city in a foreign country and I know it is rather expensive to travel there.

1hetomz,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1hetomz/what_do_you_think_about_his_behavioursituation/,What do you think about his behaviour/situation?,"Hi!

I really really like a man, we went for a little coffee date and it was great, nothing happened but we talked for hours and was amazing. 

We don't live in the same town, we live a bit far away but he comes every once in a while in the town where I live.

For two months we texted, and then he told me that he was coming back in my town. 

I invited him out for a date and he answered:
""Of course we are going to meet up, tomorrow I will be near where you live""
So I sent him a message with all my availability during that week. 
He answered ""I'll stay here for a while"", I answered ""I will be at home until the 14 of December"". He answered ""I will write you in the next few days"". It was the second of December. 

He didn't. 
14 of December arrived and I was pretty disappointed. It was 13 days after that little conversation about meeting. 13 days no a single message, only hearts on Instagram. 

On the 14 December morning he texted me ""I'm in town, do you want to meet up?"".

They moved my flight so I was already travelling. 
He texted me on the last possible day. 

I told him that the flight was anticipated and that I was gone.

He answered me kind of disappointed, saying that he really wanted to meet me. I told me that I was super sorry but I had a family thing that I couldn't miss. 

He answered that he was sorry, that it was his fault and that he was kind of late. 

I said... ok, next time you will be here we can meet up... and we wished each other merry Christmas etc. He didn't tell me when he will be back but it could be that he doesn't know yet. 

End. 

I'm so sad because I wanted to meet him again so much, I like him so so so much. But all my friends say that if a man likes you doesn't make you wait for 13 days after you ask him out. If he really liked me he didn't write me on the last possible day. 

I guess that I just have to wait that he will be in town again. If he still likes me. If he still wants to hang out. 

But... everyone is telling me that he is not so interested even if he was disappointed when I told him that I wasn't in town anymore. I didn't update him about my flight changing because he wasn't texting me. 

What do you think?
Is it a red flag?
Did I do something wrong?
What would you do?

I'm just planning to wait next time that he is around and ask him out again. Hoping that he still feels like that after this happened. 

Or just let it go?

1hetokt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1hetokt/wine_and_cheese_party/,Wine and cheese party. ,"About a month ago my partner approached me about having a work party at our house. Not an issue with me, I used to entertain over her quite a bit and we have the room. We haven't done anything in a while and I'm a pretty social person. 

She's a teacher and told me it would basically be all women and also on a weekend my daughter is over here (vs her mom's house because of shared custody) and they would be drinking. Still no problem. I figured my daughter and I would go do something together and give my partner and her colleagues some space to enjoy the evening. 

A little backstory on my partner. She is not a heavy drinker. In fact she goes months without a drink, and when she has alcohol it's maybe 2 drinks before she stops. She met me 13 years ago at a NYE party when I was on full tilt in my drinking and at a low point in my life. She has, as cliche as it sounds, seen me at my absolute worst yet still decided to stick around and has been extremely supportive and happy with my sobriety as it has given us a much better relationship. 

Anyway, long story short, my daughter (16) cancelled on me last minute because a friend of hers is back from college and she wanted to hang out with them. She cancelled on me late enough that I didn't want to try and make other plans because I typically get up pretty early these days. 

I was pretty disappointed. I decided to just stay in and be a wallflower until bed. But instead I joined the party when they started playing a game. I could have also joined in the drinking, but I didn't. I was even offered by one of the guests, but I politely declined and opened a Dr pepper Cream Soda (so freaking good). I ate cheese, crackers, and a ton of chocolate. Offered to be DD for anyone who may need it. And turned in around 10pm. I expected to be woken up to play taxi, but it didn't happen. 

So now I'm awake early on a Sunday. No hangover and enjoying my morning coffee. They cleaned up the majority of their mess, but I'm still going to mop and clean the counters and table to hopefully put a smile on my partner's face. Hopefully she isn't hungover as she doesn't react well to alcohol. 

Tbh, the drunk in me is extremely disappointed at the small amount of empty wine bottles left over. I feel like in my day I could have done that much damage by myself. üòÇ. 

Anyway, I'm closing in on 15 months and last night was just another night. No pressure. No giving in. Just keeping the momentum moving forward. 

I wish all of you the same continued success in sobriety I've been having. 

If you're new here, it does get easier and it does get better. And with a little persistence, hopefully you will have the same relationship with alcohol I do. It's just there. It's always going to be there, but we don't ever have to interact with it.

Also, a group of teachers can be downright nasty at a party and it's hilarious. And as a side note, apparently someone tried the bidet but didn't know how to use it and blasted the bathroom with toilet water. Hilarious. We still don't know who it was.  ",7,1734272953.0,stopdrinking,2,0.9,False

WATCH NFL LIVE STREAM

With the advent of Atalantanet streaming, it‚Äôs made cable a pretty outdated service. Unfortunately, there isn‚Äôt really a good place to watch sports online. I‚Äôve tried purchasing a streaming service that gives you access to NFL games, but I was also paying for a bunch of channels I never even watched. Talk about a waste of money!



But what if I told you I found a place to watch an NFL live game without cable?



Awesome, right? 



I found this awesome place that streams all NFL games online for free. And I didn‚Äôt even have to sign up!



If you‚Äôve tried to watch NFL games online before, you probably know that the NFL has some pretty strict streaming regulations. They typically want people to watch on TV. But right when I was about to give up and accept their demands, I found this great streaming service. 



It bypasses paywalls put in place by cable companies and streaming services and lets me watch games that aren‚Äôt even in my region. It‚Äôs practically heaven on Earth!



But let‚Äôs delve a bit deeper into that, shall we?



I have access to every NFL game everywhere



Did you know that streaming services like Sling and Hulu don‚Äôt give you access to all the available games? Crazy right? 



Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn‚Äôt even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.



One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I‚Äôm getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn‚Äôt the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn‚Äôt on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn‚Äôt do you any good to have access to all these games if you can‚Äôt see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your Atalantanet can handle it, anyway. But don‚Äôt worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I‚Äôve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn‚Äôt have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!



After all, what‚Äôs the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything‚Äôs buffering all the time.



In the end,



I finally don‚Äôt have to put up with streaming services or the NFL telling me how to watch my games. This has completely revolutionized how I watch football on Sunday. I get the best game day experience and I didn‚Äôt have to sacrifice an excessive amount of money or my safety!



This service offers the unbeatable game day experience by putting the power back in my hands. Which games I watch shouldn‚Äôt be decided by the NFL or my streaming service. I‚Äôve taken back the reins and have control over what I watch. 



And if you use this service, you can too.

I found it difficult to sit down the entire last weekend of November, following my brutal Thanksgiving Day punishment. This time, it was Lorena who took some pity on me and rubbed aloe vera lotion into my welts on Friday morning. Or, was it truly pity? Because, unlike Daphne, who had me lie across her knees to apply the balm, Lorena secured my arms above my head to a pulley Mason recently had installed on the ceiling of my maid‚Äôs quarters. I was dressed in white thigh high stockings with satin bows at the top and a white corset, which contrasted dramatically with the only other thing I wore: the black DOMINIX chastity cage. Lorena pulled the ropes securing my arms through the pulley sufficiently taut that I had to stand on my tippy toes. She next tightened my corset, and then rubbed her hand lightly across the welts on my ass and upper thighs. With her other hand, she reached around and squeezed my still tender right nipple. She was so close to me I could smell the shampoo on her hair and felt its silky touch on my right shoulder. She didn‚Äôt speak a word to me the entire time.

I had molested Lorena with my eyes multiple times while she worked as a maid around the mansion when I was still its master, but I had never physically molested her (well , perhaps I ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù brushed my hand against her bottom a couple of times when she picked up my plate from the table or put a drink down next to me while I worked at my desk, but the contact was minimal). Nevertheless, she seemed more bold in her willingness to grab and grope me with each passing day. Still, when I felt the cold cream on her fingers touch my bottom, it was quite unexpected and it was difficult for me to feel anything other than grateful to her. I made a somewhat high pitched gasp of surprise when she first touched me; I was embarrassed by the effeminate nature of my exclamation, even before I heard her giggle. I was so thankful for the relief (and, honestly, for a gentle touch of any kind) that I couldn‚Äôt even feel much resentment when, after finishing applying the cream, she left me standing on my toes for another 20 minutes or so while she did god knows what in some other room. As Natalie pointed out, my toes had gotten quite strong by then.

True to her word, Natalie took Ryan to see her horse breeder friend later that morning, along with Mason. When I served them tea later that afternoon, it was clear that they believed they had found a good horse for Ryan. He planned to return to the breeder in a couple of days to ride the horse again before deciding for sure. 

‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve found a beautiful horse, honey. Tomorrow afternoon, we‚Äôll all go to the saddlery together. I‚Äôm friendly with the daughter of the owner, so I booked a private appointment at 2pm so she and her assistant can help you and Mason get all the gear and clothes you need. They have a tremendous inventory, everything top of the line.,‚Äù said Natalie. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre friendly with the equestrian shop owner, too! Geez, Mom, you‚Äôre sure friendly with a lot horsey people for someone who doesn‚Äôt ride often,‚Äù said Ryan. 

‚ÄúOwner‚Äôs daughter. Her name is Suzanne. She‚Äôs a fascinating young woman. I think you‚Äôll both really enjoy meeting her. But I love horses, so it shouldn‚Äôt surprise you that I know a lot of people in the community,‚Äù said Natalie. 

‚ÄúYour mother is friends with tons of people, in many different communities. Artists, actors, writers, tennis players. The list goes on and on. It never ceases to amaze me,‚Äù said Mason.

This is true. It never ceased to amaze me either when Natalie and I were together. A natural extrovert, she is charismatic, funny and confident, with varied interests. I always resented how easily she made friends with people when it was always such a struggle for me. I‚Äôm sure some would argue that my social struggles were mainly due to my arrogance, but it‚Äôs really not that simple. I had always been socially awkward, even as a kid, and I believe that my arrogance was, to some extent at least, a defense mechanism. It‚Äôs all academic now; the social skills of an indentured domestic servant are irrelevant. 

‚ÄúI happen to love talking to talented, interesting people, that‚Äôs all. When I said that we‚Äôll all go to the saddlery together tomorrow, I mean your father too,‚Äù Natalie said to Ryan, shockingly. 

‚ÄúExcuse me, Mistress. May I have permission to speak?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYou may,‚Äù she said, before taking a bite of a scone.

‚ÄúWhy‚Ä¶why would you want me to come with you?‚Äù I asked, nervously.

‚ÄúHaving you present will be helpful for Mason and Ryan to visualize things when they select their ridding crops. They have such a large selection. Also, who knows, they might have some interesting clothing or accessories for the grooms. It‚Äôll also do you good to get out for a change, Henrietta. You can‚Äôt hide away in the house all the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶how will I dress, Mistress?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. We won‚Äôt make you go out in your maid‚Äôs uniform. Not yet, at least. You can wear those leggings I bought you last month ‚Äì the hot pink ones ‚Äì with one of the t-shirts you wear to do yard work and your Converse All Star sneakers. We really should buy you some pink Converse sneakers,‚Äù Natalie replied.

‚ÄúThank you, Mistress,‚Äù I replied, insincerely. 

I now dreaded going out in public under any circumstances ‚Äì but doing so for the purpose of helping my wife‚Äôs lover and my son choose implements with which to whip me was particularly upsetting. As if seeing my ass next to this crop or that one might somehow influence their choice of which one to purchase. Ridiculous. The real purpose of having me accompany them was to further my humiliation (one might reasonably wonder if that were even possible, but knowing Mason and Natalie as I do, I did not doubt it for even a second) by making it increasingly public. They had been hinting for a couple of months now that they planned to make my altered status much more widely known in the coming year; why not get an early start? Nevertheless, I was at least relieved that they wouldn‚Äôt be trotting me out in my maid‚Äôs uniform for the time being. 

Still, the nylon/spandex, pink leggings ‚Äì absurdly marketed as ‚Äúactivewear‚Äù ‚Äì were plenty humiliating themselves. They were a deep, neon pink color, and while not transparent, it was possible to see the outlines of my underwear ‚Äì that is, my panties ‚Äì beneath them. I could not for the life of me imagine how any man other than one who is flamboyantly gay (or, possibly, a heterosexual male far, far more secure in his masculinity than I had ever been) would ever purchase such an article of clothing. And, of course, the bulk of my chastity cage was readily apparent beneath the leggings as well. Natalie had instructed Lorena to switch out the DOMINIX for the Perverse Pink CB-6000 (her whole color coordination fixation again) when she supervised me dressing on Saturday for my big trip outside of the mansion. I wore the leggings with an old, tight black t-shirt and my ratty, black Converse All-Star sneakers. Lorena also affixed a plain black choker around my neck; at least, it wasn‚Äôt the rhinestone-studded, pink collar. I was also spared the corset, for a change. This was a real treat, as I had spent most of my waking hours over the last several weeks tight laced.

When I regarded myself in the mirror, I was ashamed of how preposterous I looked. Although, I do have to say, my ass looked pretty damn good in the leggings ‚Äì firm, shapely. My strict diet and nearly incessant physical activity while not asleep were having the desired effect, I suppose. Perhaps that it is why lately Lorena has been spending more and more time rubbing my ass with her hands when she helps dress me or restrains me. That Saturday, she rubbed my bottom for a minute or so through the leggings and then reached down to stroke (and gently squeeze) my balls through the nylon from behind, causing my cock to throb helplessly in its silicone prison. She even swatted me on the ass ‚Äì I would say ‚Äúplayfully,‚Äù but nothing felt playful given the still sorry state of my bottom, even three days after my caning. But I had a troubling thought: if Lorena found my ass attractive, what about men? Was it possible that I was being viewed as a sexual object by men? And, if so, how should I feel about that? I found the thought incredibly humiliating‚Ä¶and yet, there is something‚Ä¶exciting, I guess (is that the right word?) about it as well. Is this simply another aspect of what Natalie meant by me surrendering to my humiliation? 

It was an unseasonably warm day, and the short hoodie I wore with my ensemble left my ass fully exposed. When Ryan saw me, he laughed contemptuously. Was he looking at my ass? Please, god, no.

Of course, the contrast of how I was dressed compared to my wife and son and Mason made my appearance all the more mortifying. Natalie wore a short plaid skirt with black tights and black leather boots and a tight red blouse. Ryan and Mason were also both smartly dressed in khakis, polo shirts and leather shoes (black ankle boots for Mason and brown loafers for my son). Try to imagine how the four of us appeared as we walked through the parking lot and into the main part of the store, what is best described as an equestrian superstore, with me remaining three respectful steps behind the others, my head bowed submissively. The room was huge and moderately crowded. We got lots of double takes and lingering stares, including from a group of girls in their late teens (probably a high school equestrian team). It was hard to determine, looking at them, whether they were more focused on Ryan or on me, but the juxtaposition of me with the others certainly must have been arresting. I heard a few of them giggle, and two in particular met my eyes with a derisive smirk. I tried to turn away to prevent them from seeing my face, or the bulk of my chastity cage through my leggings; but in doing so, I of course gave them an unobstructed view of my ass. I can only imagine what they must have been thinking about this unusual foursome (although, whatever it was, it no doubt paled in comparison to the reality of the situation). 

Though my appearance was much changed, especially with my long hair, I was always fearful that I would be recognized while out in public. I had tried to keep a low profile when at my old firm, but one does not become a billionaire with a 17,000 square-foot mansion and a famous private art collection without having some photos taken of, and stories written about, you. While I‚Äôm sure that there were news reports about my sudden resignation from the firm, Natalie assures me that my transformation into her and Mason‚Äòs feminized servant was not yet part of the public record. Yet.

The three of us were led by one of the shop attendants into a large, separate back room with a couch, a couple of chairs and a coffee table. Along the right wall hung various riding paraphernalia: saddles, bridles, bits, halters, reins, saddle pads, boots, etc. On the opposite wall, there was dizzying array of riding crops, whisks, lunge whips, jumping bats and dressage whips. How could there possibly be so many different kinds?

After a few minutes, an attractive blonde woman, about 30 years old, entered the room followed by a slightly chubby man of similar age. She was dressed in tight, tan riding breeches and shiny, black boots with a white shirt and black shadbelly. The man, quite remarkably, was dressed in a jacket and tie, with short olive shorts and knee socks, and black shoes, much like a traditional British schoolboy. Except his shorts were shorter than most schoolboy uniforms, exposing much of his thighs, where red marks were plainly visible. It may have been an unseasonably warm outside, but certainly not warm enough to wear shorts. This was a new experience for me. Since the start of my subjugation in March, I had not yet laid eyes on another individual who was seemingly also in a state of subservience. The two of us briefly made eye contact. 

The woman said, ‚ÄúNatalie, it‚Äôs so great to see you again!‚Äù embracing her warmly. 

‚ÄúYou, too, Suzanne!‚Äù

Turning to Mason, Ryan and me, Suzanne said, ‚ÄúYou must be Natalie‚Äôs three men. Well, two and a half, anyhow. Welcome to Jordan‚Äôs Equestrian. Then, smiling at each of us individually, she said, ‚ÄúLet me guess. You must be Mason. You are Ryan, obviously. And, you,‚Äù (and here her smile shifted from warm to mocking) ‚Äúyou, must be Henrietta, of course. You‚Äôre all exactly as Natalie described you.‚Äù She shook Mason‚Äôs hand and then Ryan‚Äôs. I was afraid to extend my hand, so it was easy for her to ignore me.

Suzanne continued, indicating the man in shorts: ‚ÄúThis is my husband, Robbie. He‚Äôll be assisting you today.‚Äù

‚ÄúHi, it‚Äôs nice to meet you all,‚Äù Robbie said, shyly. 

‚ÄúAsk them if the they want anything to drink, rocket scientist,‚Äù Suzanne said to him sharply.

‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam, sorry. Would any of you like tea or coffee or a soda or anything?‚Äù he asked awkwardly.

I would have loved a Coke, but remained silent as the others put in their requests. Once Mason, Natalie, and Ryan sat down to talk with Suzanne, Natalie said to her, ‚ÄúPerhaps Robbie can show Henrietta some of the grooming and stable cleaning supplies while we talk. We‚Äôre going to need more of everything with three horses.‚Äù

Robbie took me back out to the main part of the store, where the equestrian club girls and other shoppers got another opportunity to stare and speculate. 

Robbie whispered to me, ‚ÄúSuzanne told me a bit about you. You‚Äôre a cuck husband, like me. Your wife is beautiful.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, I guess. Yours too.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm assuming the guy named Mason is her lover?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs he your master?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. How did you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, first of all, my wife‚Äôs lover is my master. Second, looking at him and at you, and how you‚Äôre both dressed, it isn‚Äôt hard to figure out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess you‚Äôre right.‚Äù

‚ÄúSuzanne said he‚Äôs shopping for riding crops. To discipline you, I imagine?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe has a horse, too.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMany of the crops and dressage whips we sell are dual use, so to speak. My master fancies himself a real cowboy. He whipped me yesterday with the same dressage whip he‚Äôs probably using on his horse this very minute. Of course, he uses it very gently with his horse. I‚Äôll tell you a little secret: I‚Äôll bet close to a third of the crops and whips sold in this store are used primarily or exclusively on humans. Suzanne is in the scene, you see.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe scene?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe BDSM scene, of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really quite na√Øve, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI suppose I am.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think Suzanne and your wife are going to be discussing Suzanne‚Äôs business proposition this afternoon.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI really shouldn‚Äôt say too much. Who is the other person in your party? The young man?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is‚Ä¶my‚Ä¶my son.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour‚Äôe kidding?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I wish I was.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow, and I thought I had it rough. Look, I‚Äôd better show you the grooming tools and muck forks. I don‚Äôt want Suzanne to think we‚Äôve been dawdling. Or, worse yet, talking.‚Äù

When we returned to the private room about 20 minutes later, Ryan was dressed in a polo uniform, including long, brown leather boots, a white jersey, white jeans and a black helmet. The jeans were somewhat loose fitting.

Natalie said, ‚ÄúLooking good, honey! But you won‚Äôt just be riding to play polo. You‚Äôll be riding with Mason and me for fun and at other times, too, I‚Äôm sure. And equestrian attire can be fashionable even when not riding. Besides what you‚Äôre now wearing, I think you need to buy some black boots, some short, black jackets and least one long dressage jacket. I‚Äôll bet that double-breasted French one we saw when we came in would look great on you. And you‚Äôll need several pairs of jodhpurs, both tan and white ‚Äì the tight ones, honey. Believe me, that‚Äôs what gets the attention of the young ladies.‚Äù

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be shy, honey. Suzanne is a professional. And you‚Äôve worked very hard in the gym. You shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to show off your hard work, as well as your natural gifts. Mason certainly isn‚Äôt, are you darling?‚Äù

‚ÄúHell no. If you‚Äôve got it, flaunt it, I always say,‚Äù Mason answered, unsurprisingly.

When Ryan returned 20 minutes later, after further shopping in the main store, he was classically attired in skin tight white jodhpurs, nearly knee-high black boots and a double-breasted black dressage jacket with a tailcoat. He looked‚Ä¶formidable.

‚ÄúNow we‚Äôre talking,‚Äù said Natalie, staring at our son proudly. ‚ÄúYou should get at least two pairs of black boots in addition to your brown polo boots. You know how muddy they get, especially at this time of year.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe bootblack is going to be very busy,‚Äù Mason chuckled, looking at me.

‚ÄúSpeaking of the boot boy, it‚Äôs time my two men pick out their new riding crops. Suzanne, perhaps, you can suggest a few of your favorites, for various purposes,‚Äù said Natalie, with a smirk.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd be happy to,‚Äù Suzanne replied. She pulled down four riding crops and two dressage whips from where they were being displayed on the wall.

‚ÄúThis dressage whip and this riding crop are my favorites to use in training and riding horses. They are quite gentle, as whips go, and a light tap is more than sufficient to encourage the behavior you want. These two crops, on the other hand,‚Äù ‚Äì and here she started flexing and swishing one in the air ‚Äì ‚Äúare very versatile. You might use them to prod your stallion or mare to go a bit faster, but they‚Äôre also very useful ‚Äì with the application of greater force, naturally ‚Äì in training that special submissive or servant in your life. Let me demonstrate. Robbie, get your ass over here and into position.‚Äù

Robbie hurried over next to his wife, and bent fully over, touching his toes. He was surprisingly limber for a chubby guy (then again, he was still fairly young and probably had a lot of practice touching his toes with this martinet as his wife). She swished the crop in the air a few times (canes are not the only implements capable of producing that exquisitely foreboding sound), before bringing it down a few times smartly across Robbie‚Äôs bottom, which fortunately for him, was still covered by his shorts. Despite my empathy for my fellow submissive, I couldn‚Äôt deny that it was a very erotic sight watching this sexy woman in boots and skin tight clothing whip her husband in his juvenile get-up; there was a part of me that wanted her to bare his bottom and hit him with much greater force, but this was a demonstration rather than a punishment, of course. 

‚ÄúJessie, my boyfriend, likes to use this to train Robbie in the gym. Although, as you can tell by looking at his fat ass, he needs a hell of a lot more training.‚Äù Natalie and Ryan both chuckled. 

Suzanne then put down that crop, and picked up another one. ‚ÄúThis Snowbee Horse and Pony Dressage Pro Whip, despite its name, I don‚Äôt recommend for use on any four-legged beast,‚Äù she said, again swishing it through the air. ‚ÄúNo, this is best used to discipline our ill behaved two-legged beasts. I‚Äôll show you.‚Äù Here, she brought it down harshly on poor Robbie‚Äôs bare upper thigh, causing him to cry out. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a high tech design, made with nylon and Swarovski crystals. That‚Äôs a type of glass used in fine jewelry. Robbie says it‚Äôs highly effective, don‚Äôt you, dear?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù Robbie replied, without hesitation.

‚ÄúNow, this one,‚Äù Suzanne said, picking up the final implement she had pulled down from the display case, ‚ÄúThis is from our antique collection. It‚Äôs a vintage English leather riding crop, but you can see it has the handle of a cane. It‚Äôs sort of a hybrid of a riding crop and a cane, and Robbie vouches for its effectiveness, too. Would one of you like to try it out? Or any of the others, for that matter?‚Äù

Mason said, ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôd like to try out the antique one. I like the idea of an all-in-one cane and crop. Hathaway, get next to Robbie, and touch your toes like he is.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù I replied, as I got into position, pleased that it was now quite easy for me to touch my toes (much easier than six months ago, before I had lost all the weight and spent so much time bending and contorting my body simply as a part of my daily chores). 

Mason then began swishing the antique crop theatrically through the air. Then, much to my distress, I saw through the mirror in front of me Ryan pick up the Snowbee crop and begin swishing it as well. The sounds and overall scene immediately brought back to me the memory of the old mainstream S&M film, 9 1/2 Weeks. In that movie, there is a scene in which the dominant partner, played by Mickey Rourke, takes the submissive partner, played by Kim Basinger, to an old-time equestrian shop in Manhattan. The two stuffy old salesman in suits watch in shock as Mickey repeatedly swishes a riding crop through the air, as Kim sits on a perch next to him looking downward, humiliated. If there was any lingering doubt that Mickey was purchasing the crop to use on Kim, it was erased when he brought it down on her leg. The camera then pans back to the now truly scandalized expressions on the two shop attendants‚Äô faces. 

The primary difference, of course, between the scene in the movie and my present reality was that in the latter there is no question whatsoever about who Mason and Ryan were intending to use the implements on. When Mason brought the hybrid cane/crop down on my bottom, the thin fabric of my leggings offered scant protection. Because my ass was still raw, I yelped in pain.

Natalie came to my rescue, at least to some degree: ‚ÄúDarling, don‚Äôt forget your‚Äôs and Ryan‚Äôs memorable correction of the maid on Thanksgiving. Her welts have not yet had time to properly heal. Why not have her remove her t-shirt, and use her back to try out the lovely crops Suzanne is showing you?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood idea. Remove your shirt, maid, and stand up against the wall, with your hands clasped behind your back,‚Äù Mason commanded.

 I did as ordered. Despite the pain of the first cut, my cock was straining against the cage and my nipples were rock hard. The surreal nature of this scene, me starring in a real-life S&M drama, had me highly aroused. I had only been whipped on my back once before (by Mason, over the summer, after what he believed to be my unsatisfactory job of weeding the flower beds near the pool). 

Following more swishing, Mason brought the crop down across my back. As painful as it was, it wasn‚Äôt as bad as a fresh cut across the existing wounds on my ass.

So, as much as I did not want to be grateful to Natalie  ‚Äì as this whole twisted excursion was her idea ‚Äì I could not help but be so. At least until she said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be shy, Ryan. Now that you‚Äôre living back home again, you‚Äôre going to have to play a key role in regularly disciplining the maid. It‚Äôs important that you have the right tools, so make sure you take advantage of this excellent opportunity to test a few out. Especially when you have our expert here in Suzanne to help you.‚Äù

Suzanne added, ‚ÄúI accept exchanges, of course. Especially for your mom. But why don‚Äôt you save her another trip out here and try a few out now?‚Äù

Needing no more encouragement, Ryan brought the dressage whip down on my back three times in relatively quick succession. Think of it! An 18-year-old young man whipping his 44-year-old father across the back like a master punishing a runaway slave on a plantation! Except, most runaway slaves weren‚Äôt wearing pink leggings, I suppose. Still, the entire scene was beyond belief. Natalie would call it ‚Äúunconventional‚Äù; I called it (silently, of course) ‚Äúdepraved.‚Äù From my position against the wall, I had a partial view of the mirror, so was able to brace myself for the blows somewhat before they came. I also could see Suzanne‚Äòs pleased smile in the corner of the mirror. I‚Äôm sure the effect of watching an attractive, virile young man in tight jodhpurs and boots whipping an older feminized man produced a similar effect on her to the effect on me of watching her whip her husband only a few minutes earlier. 

Suzanne made a substantial sale that Saturday afternoon. In addition to all the apparel I have already mentioned, Natalie bought close to $1000 worth of grooming and stable cleaning supplies and four of the six riding crops and dressage whips that Suzanne had showcased, including the vintage English crop and the cursed Snowbee  (which was the most painful of the three tested out on my flesh). The Snowbee  is the one that Ryan selected for use in the mansion. Altogether, Natalie spent close to $10,000 that afternoon. That is in addition to the $500,000 check she wrote as seed capital for Suzanne‚Äôs new business venture.

As Suzanne had explained to her, ‚ÄúWith the new administration coming in, especially since they have control of Congress and the Supreme Court, I‚Äôm pretty confident that the new judicial caning law they have proposed will get passed. I‚Äôve already started an online business making punishment canes for people in the scene. There‚Äôs no reason why the English should have a monopoly on this market.‚Äù

Mason interjected: ‚ÄúI always buy my canes from the online shop in the UK, but I‚Äôll have to give yours a try, assuming they‚Äôre of comparable quality.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yes, I can assure you that they are, if not better! We source our rattan from the best suppliers in Thailand and the canes are manufactured right here in Connecticut. We have excellent quality control practices.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll definitely give them a try, then. I‚Äôm always on the lookout for good new canes. God knows this bimbo maid is constantly fucking up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI promise you won‚Äôt be disappointed, Mason, And I‚Äôll give you the friends and family discount, of course. But there‚Äôs a huge business opportunity here. Once judicial caning s legalized federally, I think many state and municipal governments will be instituting it. That means there‚Äôs going to a be a huge demand on the part of these governments for canes. Who better to supply them than my new company? Made in the USA! The critical thing is to hire a salesforce right now to get out there and lock in long-term contracts with all of the government agencies that will be responsible for carrying out the punishment. I want to get out there before anyone else. There are some barriers to entry, but I‚Äôm sure there will be competition before too long. That‚Äôs what I was hoping to ask for your help in, Natalie. I need to raise money to hire a sales team and I may need to invest in some additional manufacturing capacity if we‚Äôre successful in winning contracts ‚Äì as I‚Äôm sure we will be. Do you think you could help? You‚Äôll get founder‚Äôs stock in the company, of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sounds like a pretty damned good idea to me. What do you think, Mason?‚Äù asked Natalie.

‚ÄúI like it. I think there‚Äôs very low risk, because the leaders of the incoming Congress have already said they want to pass the bill and they‚Äôve got the votes. It‚Äôs about time, too!‚Äù said Mason. Maybe he could convince the local police chief to allow him to administer the canings, the sadistic son of a bitch.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a great idea, too. Reinstituting canings certainly improved discipline at school,‚Äù added Ryan. Wonderful. Another authoritarian under the same roof to terrorize me. 

‚ÄúBeing first to market is key. I think Suzanne‚Äôs business plan has a lot of merit.‚Äù

‚ÄúSay no more. I‚Äôm all in. I‚Äôll write you a check today.  Our lawyers can work out the stock part later. I completely trust you,‚Äù said Natalie to Suzanne, with genuine enthusiasm.

And so concluded our fun trip to the equestrian store. Natalie bought the crops for Mason and Ryan and all of the apparel and footwear for Ryan as early Christmas presents. I suppose all of the muck forks, brooms, stall deodorizers and the new wheelbarrow to haul away horseshit were my early Christmas presents.

USFS press release [here](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/nfsnc/news-events/?) clearly indicated that 210 and 210B (the switchbacks to the Table Rock picnic area) were cleared and open.

I can confirm this is INCORRECT information, the road is still blocked south of the Spence Ridge Trailhead, gated and flagged for emphasis. 

I saw a lot of people on the Hawksbill trail, frankly woefully unprepared. Walking two giant dogs while holding a stainless steel coffee cup over a mile into the backcountry, with trails covered in ice is a bad idea people. 

I saw several people on the MST between Table Rock and the Chimneys, which is usual. Surprisingly much more prepared group through there, with one guy wearing only a T-shirt and a DSLR just south of the Chimneys towards Shortoff. Again, please don‚Äôt do that. There were portions of the trail with 2-3inches of ice in the Chimneys with sheer drops immediately adjacent. 

On towards the Shortoff Mountain there was unsurprisingly not a soul to be found. Not many people hiking up from Wolfpit that late in the day at this time of year.

1hetgd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prostatitis/comments/1hetgd6/male_pelvic_floor_muscles_damage_is_the_main/,Male pelvic floor muscles damage is the main source of prostatis,"These recommendations are based on my personal experience and research into other affected individuals. While not all men respond equally, adopting these strategies may help reduce or eliminate symptoms. Often, mental stress prevents full recovery, as many believe medication alone will resolve the issue. However, true recovery often requires a comprehensive lifestyle change.
Patient Profile:
‚Ä¢ Sex and Age: Men of all ages.
‚Ä¢ Associated Factors: Anxiety, stress, and an active sexual life.
Possible Causes:
‚Ä¢ Pain in the groin/perineum caused by muscle tension in the 
male pelvic floor.
‚Ä¢ Partial obstruction of urine flow due to this tension, allowing small amounts of acidic urine to enter the prostate, causing inflammation and pain.
‚Ä¢ The presence or absence of bacteria in semen does not seem to directly influence the pain.
Diagnosis and Observations:
1. Common Symptoms:
‚Ä¢ Pain in the perineum and groin.
‚Ä¢ Possibke Post-urination dribbling or a feeling of incomplete emptying.
‚Ä¢ Pain that does not correlate with an enlarged prostate.
2. Trigger Factors:
‚Ä¢ Emotional stress and anxiety. This is the main factor
‚Ä¢ Sedentary lifestyles or activities that place pressure on the pelvic area. Uncontrolled sex practice is also a major cause. 
3. Importance of Differential Diagnosis:
‚Ä¢ Identifying if the main cause is muscular (pelvic floor) rather than another sexual infection or if it is the pundendo nerve is attacked.
Treatment Recommendations:
1. Lifestyle Changes in Sexual Activity:
‚Ä¢ Total sexual abstinence for 2‚Äì3 weeks at the beginning to allow muscles to relax. Use tramadol if the pain is severe. Amitriptyline is also recommended by some.
‚Ä¢ Limit masturbation to a maximum of twice a week.
‚Ä¢ Reduce penetrative sexual activity and ensure total relaxation before and during ejaculation. Avoid delaying orgasm or tantric practices as they increase muscle tension. Taking a muscle relaxant beforehand can help. Some also say that Viagra and Cialis helps.
‚Ä¢ Be cautious, as pain often reappears 24‚Äì48 hours after overexertion. Stressful situations combined with sexual activity can worsen symptoms.
2. Use of Medication and Supplements:
‚Ä¢ Muscle relaxants such as Lioresal (baclofen) or stronger options if needed.
‚Ä¢ Anti-inflammatory medications like Naproxen can help.
‚Ä¢ Bee pollen is a mild anti-inflammatory for some.
‚Ä¢ Supplements such as quercetin (mast cell secretion blocker), magnesium glycinate (prevents muscle spasms), and vitamin C can be beneficial.
3. Physical Adjustments:
‚Ä¢ Avoid sitting for long periods or positions that put pressure on the perineum. Use a donut cushion and stand up every 1‚Äì2 hours.
‚Ä¢ Pain often recurs after long flights, extended gaming sessions, or driving jobs.
‚Ä¢ Avoid heavy lifting, weight training, running, cycling, and impact sports. Swimming and walking are highly recommended.
4. Physical Therapy:
‚Ä¢ Find a skilled male !!!! pelvic floor physiotherapist.
‚Ä¢ Therapies include:
‚Ä¢ Prostatic massage or Indiba therapy for the prostate.
‚Ä¢ Dry needling in the lumbar region (similar to acupuncture).
‚Ä¢ Shockwave therapy for the pelvic floor.
5. Relaxation and Stress Management:
‚Ä¢ Practice meditation or yoga to reduce anxiety levels.
‚Ä¢ Consider Diazepam as a muscle relaxant to aid relaxation.
6. Heat Therapy:
‚Ä¢ Use heat (e.g., sauna, hot baths) on the gluteal area to relieve pain.
‚Ä¢ Some patients report relief using vibrators between the testicular and gluteal area to relax muscles.
7. Dietary Changes:
‚Ä¢ Avoid foods that cause mucus, stomach pain, or diarrhea, especially if prone to allergies.
‚Ä¢ Eliminate coffee, energy drinks, alcohol, vinegar, and gluten, as these can irritate the nerves in some individuals.
8. Psychedelic Substances:
‚Ä¢ Many men claim that marijuana or psychedelic mushrooms trigger symptoms (though this may vary individually).
9. Stretching:
Stretching is very important. Start with kegel stretch and then when better, do hipopressive exercices as breathing exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles.
10. Be positive and patient. You will need min 3 months to recover but this is cronic as your muscles are touched. You will have to be careful for the rest of your life.",1,1734272240.0,Prostatitis,2,1.0,False
