I would rather have fun with my best (girl) friends than try and fail. But I'm constantly talked down by my family and family friends. It all started as soon as I hit 18. My uncle was leaning in my doorframe grinning and straight up said:

""Now that you 18 you gotta fuck some pussy. Come on when i was your age i had 5 girlfriends""

I shrugged but hey we were alone so it was fine. Then it got more...I dunno pronounced? A cousin friend literally said:

""Yeah you need a girl in your life bro. At this point you running on oil""

My cousin protected me and it was over. But what hurt the most was one day. I was in my grandma coffee shop. We were just talking and she decided to face time my uncle. We talked a little and he literally turned to me and said...word by word:

OH FOR FUCKS SAKE YOU 20 AND STILL NO GIRLFRIEND? WHAT YOU GONNA DO FAP FOR YOUR WHOLE LIFE? YOU GONNA SMELL LIKE CUM!

1jc5xvv,https://v.redd.it/93htaokraxoe1,Espresso Troubleshooting: What Am I Doing Wrong? Seeking Advice on Sour Shots [Delonghi ECP3630],"
Hello! I am a long time coffee enthusiast but new to the espresso world. I recently picked up this Delonghi machine and Kingrinder K6 along with some extra accessories. I have swapped out the pressurized baskets for a non-pressurized that came with this cheap amazon bottomless portafilter. I am using a single origin Guatemala light roast from a local roaster with a roast date of 2/17/25.

The problem I am having is I grind as fine as I possibly can without completely choking up the machine (32 clicks) and my shots still taste sour on the sides of my tongue which tells me that it is under extracted. As you can see in the video, I did 16 in and 36 out in about 45 seconds. I was sure to allow the machine and portafilter to have plenty of time to heat up as well.

I've heard that light roast beans can be challenging. Am I just pushing this machine beyond its limits? I also notice a lot of spraying which is quite annoying to clean up but I'm not sure if that is something I am doing wrong or maybe just the nature of the cheap basket.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated! :)

1jc5pv4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jc5pv4,Miss this girl.  Sorry it’s so long.,"This dog was incredible. She was my comfort through some of life’s sharpest turns. 

I was not in a good space mentally a little over 7 years ago now and I had not started my sobriety journey and I wanted something to love. Something that needed me, something that would keep me at home and out of trouble. 
I decided on a cat. 🐈 
     I QUICKLY learned that that asshole didn’t need me. As long as I left food out and scooped the litter box when I did come in the cat could care less if I was there or not. So it didn’t really solve any thing or fill the void I was feeling. 
       Then one day while I was out and about (at a place I shouldn’t have been at realistically) I was blindly offered a puppy. I was told she was not house broken, chewed up everything and didn’t listen to a thing. I of course was very hesitant and resistant to the idea. 
      That was until she was brought in and I laid my eyes on her. I was instantly in love. I took her home with me the same day. (Picture 1,2)She never once messed in my house. She never once chewed anything I didn’t give her to play with and she was the easiest dog I have ever trained in my life. I wouldn’t even call it training. She just did what I said from the start. Like she understood exactly what I was saying. 
First time ever putting down a puppy pad she used it, never any issues.  
The only time there was ever an “accident” indoors was we had went to someone’s house for the first time together and she went straight in and to their room and took a dump on their pillow. 😂😂But hey dogs are great judges of character and she ended up being right about this person so I wouldn’t call it an accident lol. 
    When I say this dog was incredible it’s honestly a huge understatement. 
     She followed me everywhere. If she couldn’t go I didn’t go. If I moved 2 inches on the couch she moved 3. 
If I went pee she stood guard. If someone came into my room while I was asleep she wouldn’t let them close to me. Not anyone. Not a friend a parent a stranger. She didn’t care because I wasn’t aware that they were approaching me while asleep. 
    If I was awake she would wait for command to approach anything or anyone. I mean amazing listening skills for a  “non listening” dog “trained” by an amateur. 
       She was amazing and gentle with ALL children she was very jealous and protective of other dogs when it came to me but never a kid or person. 
   She would chase a squirrel or a rabbit and loved to lunge at cats just to make them run but wouldn’t ever hurt them and if I called for her mid chase of anything she would stop on a dime and come back to me, great recall. 
she actually nursed/cleaned/cared for a baby kitten I had found abandoned outside once and treated like her own pup completely. (Cutest thing ever, picture 3)
  She slept with me every night, spent every moment of every day with me at home, if I left she would greet me at the door when I got home. We went fishing together, floating down the river, kayaking. She loved laying in the hammock with me and swinging at the park.  
      I was so very blessed. She’s only been gone for 10 days today. But it feels like the longest 10 days of my life. 
     A few days after her 7th birthday 🎉 12/27/24
She started feeling weak and not wanting to eat or drink. We spoke with the vet and come the first week of Jan had both decided it was best to bring her in. 
    I got the second worst news of my entire life that day. Her kidneys were failing. I was told to take her home and make her comfortable and told it would be no more then a day or two worth of time that I had left with my goodest girl. 💔
   They told me not to worry about feeding her and if I WANTED to syringe water/Pedialyte into her I could, just keep her warm and comfortable. 
      I of course didn’t want to hear that and I didn’t give up on my girl. I held her and stayed by her side and kept putting fluids into her because dehydration hurts and I’m not doing that to her. 
    Well after about 8 days of this there had been no improvement and I had convinced/talked myself into it being the time to take her in and have her put down. We had a huge snow storm in the forecast for the next 4 days (10-14inches) our car was broken down and I didn’t want her to take a turn for the worst and be suffering and me not be able to get her to her vet which is over an hour away from my home in the direction of the worsening storm and needing a ride since I had no vehicle. 
     So stressed. Such a hard decision and I didn’t want to let her go. 
    I asked God and I begged God to show me if I was making the wrong choice. 
  We went to the car rental company to  pick up the car we had reserved to take her on her last ride before the storm. The storm was supposed to start at 4pm. It was 8:15AM 
    Once we got to the rental place our reservation was not held, they had a different vehicle that wasn’t 4x4 so we agreed to that, when we went to pay the price difference in the two vehicles the system kept declining our card? The money was definitely there. They sent us to try our card else where and come back, we did. Card worked fine in two other places. 
They tried again. Nothing. 
    We moved money over to another card tried it again still nothing. 
Then the system went down. At this point it’s almost 9:30AM. 
  The system comes back up about 30 mins later we tried again with the second card and nothing. They tell us they aren’t sure if the second card is accepted there and to move funds back to first card that maybe the system was already the problem the first time so we go and do this and FINALLY the payment goes through and we’re ready to go out the door. YAY!
We get to the car and low and behold, the rental they replaced our reservation with has a flat tire. 
As if anything else could go wrong. 
They get this straightened out and we make it back to the house to pick up my girl for her last ride at 12pm. 
3.5 hours to pick up a car. 
Anyways we get my girl carried outside and into the car and before we make it one mile away from home the ground is WHITE  it wasn’t even snowing when we put her in the car. the storm has hit 4 hours earlier then predicted. 
   It’s snowing so hard that there is no way we could safely make it the hour drive (kids with us too) in this 2WD car. 
        When I finally got a moment to just stop and think about it I told myself that God had given me EVERY SINGLE sign possible and I just hadn’t realized it in the stress of it all. 
We went back home and I carried my girl back into the house and I just sat and cried about the day for a moment. 
     When I started crying my girl got up from next to me and come closer licked my face and laid her head in my lap. 
Mind you she hadn’t moved on her own in over a week. 
It gave me so much hope, and I felt more okay with not being able to take her and that she could outlast this storm. 
       That very night she ate some wet food on her own and started drinking water. For the next week she continued drinking water on her own and eating small bits of food mostly scraps but eating non the less.  She went another week after that eating a little more and drinking normally but hadn’t pooped in over 2 weeks at this point and I was getting super concerned then she pooped and picked up on her eating some more. 
We have a large set of steps to get into our upstairs living space and I wouldn’t let her walk them for fear of her falling but I would carry her outside to do her business daily and she would walk around outside. 
I would bring her to the porch with me of the mornings to drink my coffee like she always joined me for everyday for years. 
She was getting around pretty good but only if I had her get up. 
Then she started moving around on the bed on her own and even getting off of the bed and coming to find me throughout the house it was such and up and down experience. 
    The vet told me she wouldn’t make it even a week but my girl fought for 2 months. She never seemed to be in pain and wasn’t suffering but I was. 
     I fought with myself deciding if taking her to the vet and putting her down would be harder or if having her pass at home and having to transport her lifeless to the vet would be harder. I didn’t know. This was my first time making this decision myself. 
I didn’t know what to do. 
Once March hit I knew I had to figure it out because her eating and drinking was slowing again. 

    I get up early every morning but never before my alarm clock(6am). 
  But the morning of March 5th I set straight up in the bed at 5:24am and found that my girl had passed away in her sleep right next to me. 
   I hope that she went as peacefully as it seemed she had. And I fully believe I was awoken right after her last breath. 
       She made the choice for me in the end and I believe it was the best way. I miss her so much but I’m so thankful that all those things stopped me from taking her and that I had that extra time to love on my girl. ❤️

I’m sorry this was so long. I just needed to get it out and brag on my girl a little. 


Bonus story: (picture 4)
Me and the family had went on a weekend trip leaving Friday and retuning Sunday morning and when we had come back home this is how my girl was found. She had one item of each of ours all piled around her on the couch my shoe, one of each of my kids stuffed animals(their favorite at the time) and my partners pillow). She never cared much for toys but if we were away she would sometimes gather some up but never damaging anything. It was super cute. I guess she missed us and our things smelled like us and kept her comfort? I don’t really know but it’s adorable. 


I’d you have read this far thank you! And give your babies some extra love today. 
No matter how long we have them it’s never enough. I’m thankful for the 7 years and 3ish months with my girl but like everyone else I wanted forever with her.

The walnut, a true all-rounder in magic, is particularly powerful for wish-making spells. Walnuts found or harvested yourself are especially powerful. Offer your wish to the element of earth with care and respect. The walnut shell serves as an ""energetic envelope"" for your wish or as an offering. 

You will need: 

a piece of ritual paper, a whole, undamaged walnut, and a piece of ribbon/cord. 

Traditionally, only black or white ribbons are used. Black cord has a banishing effect, while white works on anything you wish to attract. Spells intended to attract something work particularly well during the waxing moon—especially in the last three days before the full moon. 

Make yourself comfortable, light candles, and prepare some tea or coffee. Carefully open the walnut without breaking the shell. (Important!!!)

Write your positively worded wish on the ritual paper while chewing the walnut kernel. Fold or roll the paper and place the wish inside the walnut shells, then tie the nut with the ribbon and three simple knots. 

Bury the walnut in the ground before the full moon. Before leaving the spot without turning around, release your wish with the words:

<<As ether connects the universe, so I connect with the universe and release my wish. Just as the air carries the bird, may my wish take flight through my actions. Just as the stars in the sky, may the fulfillment of my wish be at the center of the universe. So be it. >>

* It is a super-calorie efficient use of flour and rose hips, giving 675 calories for three, which is +50% more than making bannock (400) and tea (100/3 = 33.3) \[I think rose hip pie is around the 3nd best use of flour after pancakes and venison stew. Also, \]
* It gives you more 'fatigue' back than coffee.
* No scent
* Warm-up bonus from a fresh batch (can't be rewarmed unfortunately)
* Adds a nice blurry effect to your peripheral vision (wait.. this might be a con)
* AND, in what might be the best-kept secret in TLD, it EXPLODES the amount of vitamin-C you can get from rose hips: instead of using 24 rose hips to get 15 units of vit-C from tea, you can use 8 rose hips to get 6x3 = 18 units from 3 pies. Which is 54 units from 9 pies instead of 15 from one tea for the same number of rose hips. +260% vitamin C efficiency.

It is such a good recipe that I have stopped preparing rose hips for tea on my long loper.

Once you have scurvy risk in a long stalker/loper game, you either need to fish a lot (something like 1/4-1/6 of your diet needs to be fish to get enough vitamin C), or you turn to the owie-pies. 3 pies a day keeps your teeth from falling out. ",8,1742073577.0,thelongdark,3,1.0,False

## Why Body Butter? Unveiling the Magic of Intense Hydration

Before we dive into the showdown, let's talk about what makes body butter so special. In a world saturated with lotions and body creams, why choose body butter? The answer lies in its rich, concentrated formula.

Body butters are powerhouses of hydration, packed with natural oils and butters like shea butter, cocoa butter, and mango butter. These ingredients create a protective skin barrier, locking in moisture and preventing dryness. Unlike lighter lotions that often contain a higher percentage of water and evaporate quickly, body butters provide long lasting moisture, making them ideal for those with very dry skin or conditions like eczema.

Furthermore, body butters offer a luxurious sensory experience.The thick, buttery smooth texture feels indulgent on the skin, and the aromatherapy benefits of added essential oils can create a relaxing and uplifting experience. Applying body butter can transform your daily skincare routine into a pampering ritual. It's notably effective when incorporated into your nighttime routine or used post-shower, when your skin is most receptive to moisture.Body butter isn't just about moisturizing. it's also about skin repair. The concentrated ingredients work to improve skin elasticity and can even help reduce the appearance of stretch marks over time. The right body butter can soothe irritation, calm redness, and restore your skin's natural radiance.

*   **Ingredients:** This is paramount. look for natural and organic ingredients like shea butter, cocoa butter, and mango butter as the base. Pay attention to the presence of essential oils for fragrance and added benefits. If you have sensitive skin, opt for fragrance-free or unscented body butter to avoid potential irritations. Avoid products with harsh chemicals like parabens, sulfates, and phthalates—look for paraben-free, sulfate-free, and phthalate-free options.for vegan skincare, ensure the product is explicitly labeled as vegan and that no animal-derived ingredients are used.
*   **skin Type:** Consider your skin type. If you have dry skin, look for intensely moisturizing body butters with shea butter, cocoa butter and oils. For sensitive skin, fragrance-free formulas with calming ingredients are your best bet.
*   **Texture:** Do you prefer a rich, thick body butter or something lighter and whipped texture? Consider the climate you live in as well. A richer formula might be better suited for colder, drier climates. Look for a non-greasy formula that's fast absorbing.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** Are you looking for cruelty-free beauty? choose brands that are certified cruelty-free and do not test on animals. Do you value ethical sourcing? Look for companies that are obvious about their sourcing practices and prioritize fair trade ingredients.
*   **Scent:** Scent can play a big role in your experience. If you enjoy fragrance,explore body butters with essential oils that align with your mood and preferences. Lavender, chamomile, and sandalwood are great for relaxation, while citrus scents can be energizing.
*   **Price:** Body butters range in price from affordable to luxury. Set a budget and explore options within your price range. Remember that a higher price doesn't always guarantee better quality. Consider the ingredients and brand reputation when making your decision. You may find affordable body butter options offer excellent hydration and skin nourishment.

I found a colour correction specialist online and went in for a consult where they said it’s pretty easy they just fill that space with the warmer toners and you’re done. I was super hopeful, but also nervous because my hair means a lot to me and has damage from trichotillomania. 

Anyways, the toners going on and what not, and the stylist says it’s going to look black wet but I promise it’s so light. I even said “it’s not all brown right??”, with a nervous laugh because I had never seen it so dark, even wet; stylist says god no!. Once we start drying, I feel sick in my stomach at how there is not variation in colour, it’s all brown. 

From the beginning I showed at least 10 photos of clearly blonde people with a tint of warm tones throughout. The photo posted here is probably the darkest example of photos I showed. I wanted my blonde on the end to stay, just the hue warmer. I said to the stylist, it’s not exactly what I expected, and I think they knew they messed up and couldn’t give me a straight answer. They kept saying I promise it is SO light and once you’re outside you’ll see how light it is. I believed her. Side note it was my goddamn birthday so I had to go somewhere immediately and didn’t have time to look at my hair. When I got home I fell into a puddle of tears, my husband just as shocked as I am as to why on earth I am a brunette now. 

I got straight in the shower and all the brown toner was coming out, I did as many washes as I could but my poor hair felt like straw. I washed and dried and it lifted maybe 20% but it is still totally dark all over. It feels like a nightmare, I’ve been blonde as long as I can remember and I don’t even want to leave the house. 

As it’s toner, is it just a matter of waiting? And if so, WHY is it so dark? I want the salon to explain to me (waiting on a response from them) their thought process behind this. I just want to cry. I’m so upset. ",1,1742072749.0,HairDye,6,1.0,False

I work for a small hotel. It's a little fancy, about $250 a night. I work in a small bistro like restaurant near the front desk area every morning. I am being watched by everyone sadly. 

Most coworkers have been nice so they can get free stuff. They did it till they abused it and I had a hard time saying no because they would try to get me in trouble. 

I got in trouble twice because of coworkers and have gotten two write ups. One of my managers got fired because of coworkers who reported him. And yet he was hanging out with coworkers. 

One guest giving a random complaint about you and it can result to a write up. I know one of the front desk associates lost her job easily because of that. It's almost as if most employees there are trying to sabotage each another to keep their job. 

My direct boss was acting super nice and he would text me and say flirty things and all, just to get me to HR and write me up over his team making a huge mess on my workspace. I got mad and other workers there tried to exaggerate that I was snapping and guests were around and complained. (Which is a lie)

For nearly 30 years, I (52M) have been dealing with internal hemorrhoids, and occasional external “pimple-type” hemorrhoids that can be really painful. I learned to manage the internal ones (i.e., push them back in after a bowel movement) at such a gradual rate, I’d say I grew almost too comfortable dealing with it and rarely ever felt any urgency to address it.  Bleeding was an issue here and there and became a real problem a little more than 10 years ago, so I went to a doctor, who immediately banded at least two of them (he advised against doing more). It took 7ish days to recover and it was, at times, extremely painful. I had Tylenol and Motrin for the pain. That improved my situation somewhat, but over time, they returned. I went two more times for banding, which were far less painful experiences but also far less effective. Really didn’t amount to much improvement, oddly. 

Bleeding never did return aside from occasional spotting, but something more problematic developed. My internals would come out when doing the slightest activity, particularly playing soccer with my son, who is a talented kid. I go out with him to work on stuff all the time. If I took a light jog to go retrieve a ball, they might come out, and they’d be swollen, making it hard to put back in. They would come out sometimes when I was skiing or otherwise messing around, even while having beers with friends while sitting in the sun. Suddenly I could not be recreationally active (for whatever reason, I never had a problem riding a Peloton; in fact, if I had inflamed hemorrhoids, I could ride the Peloton and they would “tuck back in” and return to normal size). 

I went for an appointment for another round of “aggressive” banding, and the doctor, bless her, recommended a hemorrhoidectomy. Previous doctors told me it’s a painful procedure with inconsistent results, so I shied away. But I’m getting older. I need to change my approach while I can. 

Reddit has helped me IMMENSELY in handling this, physically and mentally. I appreciate all of you sharing your experiences, so I am offering the details of my journey in the hope it helps others.

**Pre-Day 0** 

My operation was on a Tuesday. I stopped eating on Sunday around 5:00 p.m., although I ate a couple handfuls of mixed salted nuts on Monday evening. On Monday, I drank plenty of water, had coffee in the morning, and a fair amount of chicken broth. I am prepared mentally for the most part, though I am a bit scared of what's ahead. I don't know what I don't know, but what I've heard (and read) isn't encouraging. But I'm pretty tough and I handle pain and discomfort well. Part of me is excited. I've been dealing with this for 30 years at some level. I don't know what it's like to have a normal BM.

**Day 0 - Operation Day**

I had a 10:30 a.m. arrival time, with a 12:30 p.m. surgery and an approximate 3:00 p.m. release.

I did 3 Fleet enemas back-to-back around 7:45 a.m. Drank a cup of tea before 8:30 a.m. 

My wife dropped me off at 10:30. I got checked in quick. They do the normal. I get into a gown, blood pressure, weight, sugar levels, etc. Anesthesiologist comes for a chat, explains this will be general sedation and if that’s ineffective, then anesthesia if necessary. Doctor comes by for a chat, says this should be straight-forward and I should be prepared for 2 weeks of discomfort and pain. I walk over to the surgery room. Maybe 6 people total are in there, some younger folks so perhaps they are residents or are in some training. I’m cool with it all. 

The surgery happens a bit like a woman giving birth. That’s what they tell me. They are putting compression things on my lower legs. They put a mask on me for oxygen, and that’s the last thing I remember.

I wake up in a different area, clearly a recovery zone. There are several of us there. I felt all the padding around my rear. Lots of padding. A nurse walked me through a bunch of questions. I remember none of them. Within 20 minutes or so, my wife arrived. I got into my clothes with her assistance and then into the wheelchair. I was not asked to pee. I found this odd since I’ve heard there are complications sometimes (more later). I get wheeled out to our car and off we go.

I did not talk to my surgeon post-surgery. But he did leave a message on my wife’s phone and he explained that the surgery was successful and he removed “several very large” hemorrhoids. I am glad I did 3 Fleet enemas, actually, because the second and third ones were irritating enough that it prompted some swelling, which hopefully made it very apparent what needed attention there (I’m sure the surgeon would have found everything of course).

I got home and went to bed. I did not feel any pain, just soreness. I ate lightly, mostly snacked. Triscuits, oyster crackers, Lipton chicken noodle soup. I took 1,000mg of Tylenol, and for the next several days, I will alternate between this and 600mg of Advil. I took one 5mg of oxycodone. My philosophy, which I learned here, is stay ahead of the pain. I also take a Colace in the morning and evening each day.

I had a little problem peeing the first time, but it was very easy/normal after that. I took a shower, changed my dressings, and went to sleep.

**Day 1 - First day after surgery**

I am a morning BM person. But I did not feel the need. I spent the day in bed drinking coffee, water, more soup and crackers, and half a banana. I peed all day no problem. I am taking my meds. I take one oxy in the mid-afternoon. I showered and cleaned the area, and then applied new dressings. I use Tucks for post-shower cleaning, then leave gauze in the area, and have a pad in my underwear just in case. I have hardly seen any blood or discharge. I am surprised at how mobile I am, and I have thoughts of returning to work sooner than planned.

I haven’t had a lot of gas, and the little I do have is not a problem.

**Day 2**

I woke up and I knew I was going to have a BM. I take all my meds, Colace, and an oxy. I get to the point that I am confident I am going to have a BM and I go. Everything is done quickly, less than 2 minutes. Consistency is like others have said. Soft-serve ice cream. It’s not terrible, but I am instantly sore. I took a shower, got cleaned up, and went back to bed. I got more and more sore as time passed. 

Suddenly peeing was not so easy. In fact, I pretty much can’t. I blamed the swelling and subsequent pressure in the area after the first BM. To help, I took a shower, which relaxed everything. After 10 minutes, I finished peeing. Never a stream. I’d pee, wait for some part of the bladder or whatever to “fill up” again, pee that, and repeat. Took several times to clear my bladder. Ok, I can live with that.

Still the same diet, meds, etc. 

**Day 3**

A similar day but now the soreness is just always there and I am experiencing occasional spasms around my anus that are painful. I am also far less spry, to the extent that I was. Sitting up to get out of bed takes a few moments. I can get around ok, but sitting up and sitting down takes some care. I also am now in a mode where if I want to pee, I need to get into the shower. I can’t stand and pee in the toilet. I need the sensation of the warm water, and I think I need the dilation that the warm water brings. Reduced swelling helps clear all the tubing, I think.

Still the same meds, though I am discovering that the 5mg of oxy isn’t really that helpful with the pain. Doctor says I can go to 10mg, but I don’t really want to. I take an extra ½, and 7.5mg seems to be a nice sweet spot. I feel much more comfortable at this level. I did talk to my doctor today, and he’s pleased with my progress. He said bowel movements will be painful for the next two weeks.

And then in the evening, around 9:00, I felt the need for another BM. That surprised me. I almost talked myself into waiting until morning, but I thought better of it. I went, showered, etc. and felt much better. I went to bed, and with the help of an Ambien, went to sleep around 11 and woke up at 9! 

**Day 4**

Stay tuned.

Today is day 17 on Celexa (F30)


I not sure at this point what is causing the diarrhea and I'm looking for your guys input. 

I finally went 2 weeks no diarrhea or Constipation. Regular BM finally!! That's RIGHT after starting meds

I started working out again this week, the following morning... Diarrhea no clue why.  The following day exactly the same thing. 

Then Thursday night I didn't work out, but pushed the limits and had takeout greasy foods and this morning NO diarrhea so I thought.. maybe working out is linked together... So then I pushed my limits again yesterday (Friday) I had a spicy pasta for lunch and coffee after work, diarrhea (although it only happened once and it was after I finished the coffee)

This morning, I worked out, ate, had my chai latte, but now 8hrs later I'm feeling light headed and dizzy.

Soo, in YOUR opinion.... Can working out cause diarrhea? Would the meds be doing this?  Anyone else experience this?! 

As for the coffee and spicy pasta, I sometimes can eat/ drink that with NO issues and sometimes it bothers me? Why isn't there any winning?! 

I'm tired of this!!!  I'm on anxirty meds for a reason and I have health anxiety on-top of this so I am a ball of emotions now. I thought I finally figured it out after starting the meds and finally not having the runs!! But I was sadly mistaken. ",2,1742072482.0,citalopram_celexa,0,1.0,False
1jc52tb,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1jc52tb/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

Background:

Recently I was at the my doctor for unrelated issues and mentioned that for the last few years randomly (maybe once a week or once every few weeks if it's bad) I wake up 1 to 10 times in a night as I'm forcefully sitting up because I can't breathe, it usually happens when going to sleep on my back or right side but overall during the day I feel fine and don't need naps unless I've gotten little sleep or eaten too many carbs.

I sleep 7 1/2 to 10 1/2 hours a night (usually 9 1/2)

I usually feel decent waking up but some nights I sleep 10 hours and wake up tired and others I sleep 7 1/2 and wake up feeling amazing

I don't nod off or feel tired during the day overall but I do drink a lot of coffee

  
Question:

I went in to a sleep medicine doctor and was told I'd almost definitely need a CPAP and they are having me pickup the at home study machine. Regardless of what the machine says, do I really need it if I'm feeling decent or is my ""decent"" possibly a degraded version of what it could be? I do struggle to breathe randomly but then sometimes I go weeks without noticing waking up and not breathing.

I’m 20 and honestly just trying to see if this works at all :) 

( First things first,  I’m open to sending a photo. I think physically attraction is somewhat important )

About meeee: 

I’ve dabbled in a ton of different hobbies, I love trying new things and some I’ve picked up are: hiking, crocheting and I sew from time to time and reading. My favourite book has to be Flowers for Algernon, I read it years ago it’s the first book I ever read and what got me into reading, I love its message and it’s an overall good book. As you can tell they’re all mostly indoor, but I’m very much trying to put myself out there, although I fee most comfy in my room and much prefer being alone but I’d love to meet someone who challenges me to go out more, or someone the same is good too (we’ll be in our rooms together) 

Music wise, I love folk indie, rock, punk rock and girly pop music and I listen to country too from time to time. 

I’ve never been in a relationship but I’ve been close. I have a clear view of my understanding of what I want out of one and love love, I’m a massive hopeless romantic and hope to meet “the one” and settle down someday soon, it might be you…who knows.

I work as a Digital Manager for a coffee company here and it takes up a lot of my time, making it hard to find socialising time in between, hence me deciding to try this route. Physically, I work out, 5’3, black and have a muscular chubby built if you can imagine that at all “slim thick” if you will, work makes it hard to be consistent as my work times vary sometimes and I find myself too tired after a long day, but I think lacking discipline plays a big part which I know is a weakness of mine. But I pride myself on looking and dressing good regardless, being presentable is a must to me.

Personality wise:

I’m a rather sensitive person, I’m super gentle and I have genuine care for people and everything really. My love languages are words of affirmation and acts of service ( probably why I have a praise kink tbf ) I’d describe myself as an empath and try be intentional about the people I meet, I much prefer deeper connections with people rather than surface level be it friendship or romantic connections but I’m a massive sucker for banter and laughs, I’m a silly goose at heart, I’m looking for someone who doesn’t take life too seriously at times. I find humour super important in a connection, I honestly laugh at almost everything.

What I’m looking for: 

Someone to build a connection with, i don’t want to rush into anything but rather to work towards a relationship ideally. I wanna learn about you and find out what you love and hopefully learn to love it as much as you do, i will say…I have a preference for white men as I’ve mainly grown up in white spaces (it’s odd to say but I’m being as honest as I can) I’d also prefer someone who works out regularly and cares about their appearance as much as I do, I find it super attractive. Age range is 20 - 25 but if you’re a little older than that I’m not opposed to it :)

I’ve yapped far to long at this point and I hope you’ve liked the read if you get to reading all this, lastly I don’t mind a LDR nor time difference, I see myself moving in the near future and who knows, maybe I might move to wherever you’re at if convinced. I feel my career is getting quite stagnant here as I’d like to go more into Graphic Design (specifically UI/IX), which is my true passion and what I truly excel at. Anywhoo, that me!

If this was appealing to you at all then shoot me a message, I’m on here almost every day and I don’t reply it’s probs cause I’m asleep but will reply as soon as I can chat soon, hopefully x",1,1742071995.0,DatingAfterTwenty,0,1.0,False

1jc4utl,https://i.redd.it/jclmz1g32xoe1.jpeg,1792 Full Proof Review,"1792 Full Proof Bourbon, bottled at its original barrel entry proof of 125 (62.5% ABV), is a bold, unapologetic expression from the Barton 1792 Distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky.

Appearance: Pouring into the glass, it’s a deep amber with a burnt orange glow—rich and inviting. Swirl it, and you’ll notice thick, slow legs clinging to the sides, a testament to its hefty proof and non-chill-filtered nature.

Nose: The aroma hits hard right out of the gate, with a strong ethanol punch that’s to be expected at 125 proof. Give it a moment to breathe—say, 15-30 minutes—and it opens up nicely. Caramel and toffee lead the charge, backed by a smoky oak presence that feels seasoned and robust. There’s a sweet vanilla undertone, mingling with hints of cinnamon and rye spice. Some might catch fleeting notes of dark fruit (think raisins or cherries) or even a whiff of baked goods like cornbread or cinnamon rolls. It’s not the most complex nose, but it’s full and assertive, rewarding patience.

Palate: First sip? Brace yourself—it’s a firecracker. The heat announces itself immediately, coating the tongue with a prickly warmth that’s not for the faint of heart. Beneath that, though, lies a surprisingly creamy mouthfeel, oily and substantial. Classic bourbon flavors shine through: caramel and vanilla weave together with a toasted oak backbone. The high rye content brings a spicy kick—cinnamon and clove stand out—while a subtle sweetness (think corn or molasses) keeps it from going too dry. There’s a lot going on, but it’s not overly nuanced; it’s more of a full-frontal flavor assault than a delicate dance. Adding a few drops of water tames the heat a bit, letting the sweeter and spicier notes stretch their legs.

Finish: Long and lingering, the finish keeps the heat dialed up, leaving a tingling burn on the tongue and a warm glow in the chest. Smoky oak and rye spice dominate, with echoes of caramel and a faint bitterness—like dark chocolate or coffee grounds—rounding it out. It’s not the smoothest exit, but it’s memorable, sticking around like a guest who’s reluctant to leave the party.

Overall: 1792 Full Proof is a bruiser of a bourbon—big, bold, and unrefined in the best way. It’s not trying to win you over with subtlety or sophistication; it’s here to deliver a robust, high-proof experience that bourbon lovers who crave intensity will appreciate. At an MSRP around $45-60 (though good luck finding it at that price post-2020, when Jim Murray crowned it World Whisky of the Year), it’s a solid value compared to pricier barrel-proof heavyweights like Stagg Jr. or Elijah Craig Barrel Proof. That said, it’s not perfect—the heat can overshadow some of the flavors, and it lacks the depth of its more illustrious competitors.
Score: I’d give it an 84 out of 100. Someone who is more into high proof would likely score it higher.  It’s a standout in the 1792 lineup, offering more punch and personality than the Small Batch, but it doesn’t quite reach the pinnacle of high-proof bourbon greatness. If you like your whiskey hot and hearty, snag a bottle. If you prefer balance over brawn, you might want to try it at a bar first.

Recommendation: Sip it neat if you’re a proof hound, but a splash of water or an ice cube can make it more approachable without dulling its spirit. Pair it with a smoky cigar or a rich dessert like pecan pie—it’ll hold its own.

1jc4ufb,https://i.redd.it/o5q6bfh02xoe1.jpeg,luke danes …a rant,"I was introduced to GG by my older sister, who watched it when it first aired when we were kids. She was in her teens and I was maybe like 7-8. One thing we always seemed to have in common was that we both agreed that Luke was the ideal guy for Lorelai. I have rewatched many times since then, but now that I’m approaching my thirties, I have 2 small kids, and i’m in a stable relationship. Through these life experiences, I’ve been able to come to a conclusion- Luke sucks. Don’t get me wrong, he has a lot of good qualities, and most of the time his heart seems like it’s in the right place but honestly towards the end of the show, I feel like Lorelai could have done so much better. Lor is a happy go lucky, fun loving, exciting but still responsible person and Luke is such a sourpuss all the time. He puts a damper on so many of Lorelei’s experiences, he’s always grumbling about this or that, and almost everything that comes out of his mouth is slightly negative. When he’s trying to chase Lorelai at the beginning of the show and leading up to when they start dating; he’s so lovely and puts his best foot forward and then once he has her he treats her like shit. He hid his child from her, once he told her; he made it clear he didn’t want her or her opinions around April at all, he was a nightmare infront of Rory several times like at martha’s vineyard, and he made Lorelai cancel the wedding after finding out about April. In the episode before finding out about April, Lorelai made a comment like “when we get married” and he said “yeah whenever that happens”, like insinuating that he was bothered that they hadn’t set a date but then april appears so the wedding has to be canceled. everything is on his terms all the time!!! throughout season 6 Lorelai is so incredibly unhappy and Luke has little to not emotional intelligence at all apparently because he never not once asked her if she was okay or noticed that she was absolutely miserable and so affected by everything that was happening. if you really love someone you can tell when they’re not okay !!  

i feel like we all like Luke because he’s always there to fix things around the house, and shovel the snow out of the driveway, and make the coffee and the food, and help out at the town stuff… but it’s like he does all these things to make up for the fact that his personality sucks. the bar is so low!! 

idk. i feel that lorelai settled. it would’ve been cool if she would have taken that offer to sell the dragonfly and work internationally as a consultant and meet someone else. by staying with luke the only thing she achieved was staying in stars hollow and living the life she was already so used to…lets be honest with ourselves: 

was luke gonna plan vacations with her since she loved to travel? 

was luke going to plan nice dates for anniversaries and birthdays since she loves getting gifts and celebrating so much? 

NO! luke sounds like the kind of guy to ruin a vacation with his horrible attitude. 

in real life these two wouldn’t have made it. maybe for a while but not as endgame and that’s just that. tell me if i’m wrong. ",36,1742071849.0,GilmoreGirls,30,0.91,False

I don't even know what specific Columbian because my favorite is from Fresh Roasted Coffee llc on Amazon. And they just label it Columbian.

I'd love to get this from Maria's but they seem to be always out of Columbian beans and if they have them i can't make sense of the origin. 

My second favorite is Brazil but I find I like it even more burnt up and my current batch smokes before  the second crack and my little workshop is like a Cheech and Chong movie lol.  

Is it bad that I determine the stopping point on how much smoke is coming out of the Behmore?  

It may not look like it in the picture but these beans will have a ton of oil on them in a couple days and I will love it in my automatic drip coffee maker and also my French press.

I've been to Rome & Venice before, like 10 years ago, but I only remember vague snippets 'cause I've got the memory of a goldfish. I've got no set itinerary other than the art exhibition, so the current outline is...

\-Land in Rome morning of Day 1

\-Day 1-4 Rome

\-Day 5-7 Florence

\-Day 8-9 Venice

\-Fly out from Venice the morning of the 16th

My worry is that I lined up too many hectic, tourist-dense cities. My initial thought was that I could get my fill of small town vibes by taking day-trips from these 3 places, but with only 9-ish days to play with, I feel like I'd be spreading myself too thin.

I'm thinking about ditching Venice for Bologna, maybe even ditching Florence for something like Cinque Terre. Anyone have thoughts on this, or any other advice/suggestions? Is Florence as must-see as everyone makes it out to be?

Some things to note: I'm solo, on a modest budget, do not drink, and like to wander. I appreciate history, but am not into long info-dense tours. More into music, coffee, crafts, food, & just seeing unique moments unfold. Also having a bit of a career crisis so seeing how different people live & find fulfillment is something I'm very interested in, and I feel like I won't get a good swath of that if I just stick to these tourist hot-spots.

The air in the house felt lighter for Crystal and Emily as they settled into a moment of celebration, glasses of white wine clinking softly in their hands. As they sank into the plush cushions of the drawing room Crystal reflected on her journey thus far. There was a mixture of relief and determination washing over her.

“I can’t believe I made it through,” Crystal said, her eyes sparkling with gratitude. “But I know I have to step up my game or else I’m going home for sure. I can’t let the nerves or pressure get to me. I need to be fierce. I can’t hold back yet I can’t push it so far that it becomes a mess.”

Emily nodded, her expression encouraging. “It’s about finding the right balance. You’ll get it. You’re going to do well,” she assured her, the warmth of their friendship evident in her voice. “Let’s go practice poses in the mirror.”

They rose from the couch and made their way to the large mirror in the drawing room, giggling and sipping their wine as they began to practice. Crystal struck various poses, experimenting with angles and expressions while Emily offered constructive feedback, her own confidence soaring as she joined in.

Meanwhile, on the patio, Freja sat alone, her thoughts swirling in the evening breeze. The absence of Issa weighed heavily on her; her best friend’s departure had left a palpable void. She hadn’t really bonded with the other girls—besides Issa, they felt so different from her. Freja identified as a hippie, punk-rock tomboy while the rest of the cast seemed to embody a more feminine, girly-girl aesthetic.

Inhaling deeply from her cigarette, she contemplated smoking. “I really need to quit smoking,” she muttered to herself, exhaling a thin stream of smoke. But the cigarettes were a crutch, a way to manage the stress that came with the competition. On the plus side, having her own room felt liberating, a space where she could embrace her individuality without compromise. So at least there was one good thing about Issa leaving. Now she had her own room.

Meanwhile in her own room Maria was scribbling in her journal, processing the day’s events. Just as she was lost in her thoughts, Missy approached, a friendly smile on her face. “I bet it’s nice to have your own room now that Hiandra’s gone,” she remarked, leaning against the doorframe.

“Yeah, it’s nice,” Maria replied, glancing up from her writing. “I liked Hiandra but I also like having my own space.”

“How are you doing? Today was intense,” Missy asked, her tone sincere.

“Yeah, I’m just writing about it right now. I’m glad I won immunity but it’s still hard. I’m having a rough time because I went from first to seventh. That’s not good. I can’t slip up again or else I could go home next. That's a big possibility. I am afraid I'm going to get eliminated next,” Maria confessed, a hint of vulnerability creeping into her voice.

“It could be anyone. It could be me,” Missy replied, her brows furrowing in empathy. “I went from first to fourth and then fourth again. Right now I’m pretty much just in the middle. I’m still in the top half but basically I’m in the middle. I need to climb back up to the top spot somehow. With only eight of us left anyone could go next, even the ones who got a first callout.”

“I don’t think you’ll go next. Crystal’s still here,” Maria said matter-of-factly, trying to reassure her friend.

“True but she could turn it around. Emily’s already improving. Crystal could definitely improve. But you’re right; it’s likely that Crystal will go before me. Emily could go next, too. She's improving sure but is it fast enough? Am I going to reach number one again? I hope so,"" said Missy, her voice laced with worry. “Well, I just wanted to stop by and check on you. If you need anything, I’m here to talk and be a friend.”

“Thanks, I appreciate you,” Maria said, a genuine smile spreading across her face.

Soon it was night and the models were fast asleep. As the morning sun spilled into the dining area, illuminating the models gathered for breakfast, the atmosphere was a blend of excitement and apprehension. The clatter of dishes and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, creating a comforting backdrop to the swirling thoughts of the competitors.

Freja sat at the end of the table, her gaze distant as she picked at her food. She felt somewhat isolated, still adjusting to the absence of Issa and the new dynamics forming among the other girls. The lively chatter from Lily and Edita broke her reverie, drawing her attention to their animated conversation.

“Maybe we’ll be theater geeks like that drama queen movie Lindsay was in that got overshadowed by *Mean Girls*,” Edita suggested, a playful smirk on her face.

“Or maybe it’ll be Halloween costumes since Halloween was featured in *Mean Girls*,” Lily chimed in, her eyes sparkling with mischief as she sipped her coffee.

“Or maybe we’re doing cute mug shots,” Edita giggled, recalling Lindsay’s mug shot. “Remember Lindsay's?”

“It’s so iconic,” Lily agreed, laughing at the thought. The two of them shared a moment of camaraderie, clearly enjoying the anticipation of what was to come.

As their laughter echoed through the room, Freja couldn’t help but feel a pang of longing. She appreciated their energy but wished for her best friend in the house Issa to be there to talk to her. With a sigh, she returned to her thoughts, wondering what the day would hold.

Soon, the models headed to the studio, a mix of excitement and nerves coursing through them. Upon arrival, they were greeted by Lindsay who stood at the front of the studio in an oversized pinstripe suit that paid homage to Julia Roberts in the early '90s. Her curly hair framed her face beautifully and her minimal makeup accentuated her natural beauty. She radiated confidence and charisma, instantly capturing the attention of the models.

“Welcome ladies!” Lindsay exclaimed, her voice warm and inviting. “Today we’re going to have a lot of fun! I hope you’re ready to bring your A-game because we’re diving into a theme that celebrates individuality and creativity. Today’s shoot is taking inspiration from my pop music career! I released two albums in 2004 and 2005, *Speak* and *A Little More Personal (Raw)*. They are iconic album covers! So today we are going to be creating iconic pop album covers!” The models cheered with excitement. Lindsay continued, her enthusiasm infectious. “You all have complete freedom to do whatever you want for this shoot. You can go more glam, or more pop/punk, it could be something more edgy or avant-garde, or it could be an image that is more minimal and stripped back. It can be more 80s or more Y2K inspired. It can be whatever you want but it should have an iconic feel or vibe to it. Inspo is optional. Get creative, have fun! Imagine yourself as pop stars and create the album cover of your dreams!”

A wave of excitement washed over the group, sparking a flurry of whispered ideas and suggestions. Crystal leaned over to Emily, her eyes alight with inspiration. “What if I go for something 80s inspired? Or I could do something 90s inspired and simple. Or I could go 2000s pop/punk. I could do something pop/rock. Or maybe bubblegum. What about 70s disco? Disco is considered pop right? Ooh what about something dark and mysterious like that one Billie Eilish cover? There's so many options!”

“Those are all great ideas!” Emily responded, her own mind racing with possibilities. “I think I might do something simple, cute and flirty.""

Meanwhile Freja felt a spark of inspiration ignite within her. “I could do something pop/punk inspired, something edgy and cool” she said to her makeup-artist. ""I think I'll go with that kind of vibe.""

The models got ready and worked it at the pop star album cover photoshoot. Let's see how each of them did:

1jc4o2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1jc4o2a/coffee_bar_manager_newbie/,coffee bar manager newbie,"to preface this, I’m not quite sure if it should be labeled a rant or not but here we go. 

I (21F) have been in the service industry my entire working life, I have been in the coffee industry for almost 3 and a half years now. I live in a small tourist town but we have a really good local base but our coffee shop takes coffee seriously. We roast and produce all of our coffee to retail and wholesale customers, all of the baristas are SCA certified, etc. 

That being said, I got hired a year ago and have quickly climbed in the workplace, brought people on the team, and now am in a coffee bar manager position. When I started we were super short staffed and I recommended hiring two of my friends (who had formal interviews and hiring processes within the company). I was friends with both of them, actually meeting them from other coffee related jobs in the past few years. 

I have quickly come to notice that there is a very interesting dynamic socially. Everyone (5 folks) working in the bar is in their early 20s and are all female baristas. A couple baristas (both close friends of mine before this job) have kind of created this tense, mean girl kind of environment. Everyone is feeling this. Someone else on bar particularly feels ostracized, one person feels very annoyed that we cannot act like adults and I agree with them. Things get taken personally, occasionally one of them (who does not have the authority) will snap at coworkers and tell them what to do in an unkind tone, be rude to customers, and to other staff in the company. I’m sure I have some influence on this as I get tense during busy periods and ask for things to get done, however I NEVER try to take up a tone with anyone or bark orders. I am not a perfect person of course so perhaps I seem more rude than I try to come off, maybe not. Either way, this is a behavior that is noticed by my superiors and I worry that I encouraged it unintentionally or something but it’s getting out of control. 

Outside of work, I am no longer really seeing these two friends of mine as they have stopped including me in plans and when I asked if they wanted to do something, both glanced at each other and said they were busy, that sort of thing. 

Ever since I became manager, I am now getting some of the emotional intensity that my superiors were getting before. This is my first manager position and I am so lost on how to properly separate interpersonal and work relationships because clearly this is something that they are not doing, however I need to grow the hell up and continue doing my job because I cannot make choices based on immature high school level behaviors. 

The feedback I get from my bosses are all good things, I also get good feedback from the other two people on the team. I hope this means that I am doing my job and doing it as well as possible, I just can’t help but feel so emotionally exhausted when I am getting treated poorly by my coworkers. 

Does anyone have advice or insight to this situation/ tips for becoming manager and not always doing things that make “friends” happy? ",2,1742071365.0,barista,9,0.75,False

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

An appropriate approach may be a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined the \`gestalts´.

The Twisted Sista is the perfect weight for my hair and never leaves me feeling oily or heavy. 

What's your favorite hair oil that you use? 

Routine:

Wash my hair once a week-
I use Nexxus Keraphix Damage Healing Shampoo and Soapbox Biotin and Superfruit Conditioner. I allow the conditioner to sit in my hair for 2-5mins before rinsing. 

While hair is wet from out of the shower I apply the Soapbox Mane Tamer Leave-In Conditioner and Moroccanoil Smoothing throughout my hair. I only finger curl the front section of my hair and bangs. I hand scrunch the rest of my hair (Occasionally I have to finger curl the blonde parts to get them to ringlet right) and then hit it with my diffuser section by section.

I'm (27M) working remotely and looking for new things to do while spending all day home, like both indoor and outdoor activities.

I work 4 (sometimes 8) hours a day, most of the time either playing (CS2 or Efootball) or going out to the same coffee shop or going to the gym (not anymore as my knee is fucked) and it's getting boring honestly as I'm staying in my appartement (Bardo) or with family (Manzel-temime) not doing much.

Lt Williams looked at the Voxel screen in amazement. Instead of the normal small group of alien drop pods, a steady stream was descending from orbit.



*Did we lose the fight in orbit?* Lt Williams wondered. It didn’t seem possible. The alien vessel had been deprived of its only known anti-capital ship weapon. There was no way it could have destroyed *Hermes* and her escorts, not to mention the two battlecruisers. Williams looked closer and saw blue dots of friendly IFF signals appearing at the edge of the Voxel system’s range, his confusion subsiding. Whatever was going on in orbit the aliens seemed to have launched their main invasion force; and the 7th Task Force Sparrowhawks were harrying them all the way into the atmosphere. He looked up through his cockpit canopy, but the incoming drop pods and Sparrowhawks were still too far away to see visually in the bright afternoon sky. Lt Williams switched his comms over to Delta wing’s guard channel, hoping to hear how the fight was going.



“-and closing,” a male voice said, finishing a transmission.



“Roger,” came a hard female voice. “You go left, I’ll take right.” 



“Phantom away,” came the male voice again. A second later he said, “two kills.”



“One away. Two away,” the female officer said, waiting a moment before calling out in grim satisfaction as both missiles hit their targets. “Delta zero-niner, what’s your ammo look like?”



“Just the Crusader,” Delta zero-nine replied. “Should we use it?”



“Negative,” the female officer replied. “These little pods are too maneuverable, we might miss and hit the surface. We can’t risk that kind of friendly fire. Let’s head back to the barn.”



“Roger,” Delta zero-nine answered.



Lt Williams switched back to the PDF frequency, then gripped the controls of his bird and weaved back and forth, straining his eyes for the tell-tale specks that would herald the arrival of the alien drop pods.



“Sounds like the fight’s coming to us,” mused Ensign Thompson.



“Good,” Lt Williams answered vehemently. “We’ve been circling out here waiting for so long I’m starting to think Lt Cdr Jeffrey has forgotten us.”



“Does seem that way,” Ensign Thompson grumbled. “But the LZ the Bravo boys found was at least twice the size of this one; and from the comm chatter it sounds like most of the drop pods are going over there.”



“Then why not send us in with everybody else? It’s not like they’re going to lose this LZ if we aren’t hovering around it,” Lt Williams argued.



“Don’t get angry with me,” Ensign Thompson shot back. “I’m not calling the shots.”



“Sorry,” Lt Williams said, taking a deep breath. “I’m just going stir crazy flying in lazy circles listening to everyone else doing gun runs over there.”



“I’m sure there will be plenty of action for us once they’ve mopped up over there,” Ensign Thompson grumbled.



“You’re not tired already, are you?” Lt Williams asked, poking fun at his gunner as he picked out a small speck in the bright blue sky.



“No, I drank too much coffee for that,” Ensign Thompson replied.



Lt Williams stifled a chuckle. All this circling was probably agony for Ensign Thompson. “I’ve got the bogeys in visual range,” he told Ensign Thompson. “Let’s use up our ammo and go reload.”



“They’re gonna have to pay for a new flight suit if they refuse,” Ensign Thompson growled.



Lt Williams grinned. “Or you could pop the canopy and piss over the side,” he joked. A pencil bounced off the back of his helmet and he laughed, “Careful, you’re gonna run out of pencils to throw at me.” He pointed the Sparrowhawk up at the incoming alien drop pods.



“I buy them by the case,” Ensign Thompson muttered as he concentrated on the targeting screen in front of him.



Lt Williams itched to climb up and engage, but the still burning wreckage of the two PDF pilots who had found this LZ provided a grim reminder of the dangers of the alien ground fire. He watched as the drop pods grew larger, seeing retro thrusters burn. *That’s new*, he thought, taking a closer look. The drop pods looked to be within firing range, but Ensign Thompson hadn’t opened up. He snuck a look at the Voxel screen. The aliens were still just over twice the effective range of the Sparrowhawk’s cannons. *What are these…* He thumbed a control on his flight stick and a magnified image was displayed on one of his flight screens. The alien drop pod was substantially larger than the previous ones, with six jointed landing gear protruding from a cylindrical body. The ends were rounded and had… Lt Williams jinked hard and almost crashed into the tree canopy, just as a ball of blue fire erupted from something that looked very much like the point defense turrets on the alien mothership. A grunt from Ensign Thompson, followed by a brief brrt from the twin cannons revealed he had been unprepared for the sudden maneuver. Lt Williams ignored the muttered expletive from behind him as he opened the comms.



“Crescent Tower, this is Delta three-five. I’ve got eyes on a new alien landing craft,” Lt Williams called out. “They’re much larger and have defensive weapons.”



There was a moment's pause before the PDF Air Traffic Controller replied. “What? Where? Why didn’t we get any warning from the Navy?”



“This *is* your warning from the Navy,” Lt Williams shot back. “They’re landing at the hostile LZ on search leg Zero-Two. I advise the other pilots watch their backs so they don’t get sniped.”



“Watch it, *Navy*,” growled the ATC. “There’s a bigger fight going on than your little chunk of sky. Provide visual confirmation of the new alien craft for PDF intelligence officers.”



Lt Williams fumed for a moment, considering telling the arrogant PDF officer to fly out and visually confirm for himself.



“Little prick,” Ensign Thompson growled in the silence.



Lt Williams couldn’t help but smile weakly at Ensign Thompson voicing his thoughts. He closed his eyes for a moment and took a breath.



“We might as well send the footage we have,” Lt Williams said with an explosive sigh. “Maybe it’ll help get this thing over quicker.”



“Aye aye,” grumbled Ensign Thompson, sending the magnified gun camera footage via data packet to the Crescent PDF Control Tower.



Lt Williams circled, watching as an intermittent stream of the larger alien craft landed in the clearing. He counted over three dozen when suddenly the Voxel system chirped a warning.



He looked at the screen and saw the Voxel indicating movement near the ground, under the tree canopy. “Thompson,” he called over his shoulder. “We’ve got movement on the ground.” He angled the control yoke and the Sparrowhawk began drifting away from the detected movement.



“Looks like the aliens are trying to get rid of us,” growled Ensign Thompson. “I wonder what a Crusader round would look like when it hits the ground.”



“A lot of paperwork,” quipped Lt Williams; but he turned the Sparrowhawk and adjusted the controls until the nose was pointed at the ground. “Can you get any idea of what’s down there?”



Ensign Thompson was quiet for a few moments as he adjusted settings on his screens. Lt Williams edged the Sparrowhawk back away from the area the Voxel detector was indicating as moving, keeping what he hoped was enough of a gap to give him time to react.



“There’s three large blips moving along the forest floor,” Ensign Thompson finally said. “I can’t tell if it’s three large things, or three large groups of aliens. Whatever they are, they’re headed straight for us.”



“Copy that,” Lt Williams answered. He keyed the comms for the PDF control tower. “Crescent Control, this is Delta three-five. I have bogeys on the ground heading in my direction. I can’t confirm hostile, please advise.”



There was a long pause, then Lt Cdr Jeffrey’s voice came over the comm. “Did you say you have ground forces?”



“Possibly,” Lt Williams answered. “I can’t get a visual through the canopy, and there’s too much clutter on the Voxel to make out enough detail.”



“Roger. Standby. If you can confirm let us know,” Lt Cdr Jeffrey answered.



“More waiting,” grumbled Ensign Thompson.



“Yeah,” Lt Williams sighed. “But it might just be this planet’s version of bears or something.”



Ensign Thompson snorted. “Yeah. Alien bears taking a leisurely walk away from a hostile landing zone. Sounds legit.”



Lt Williams laughed. “Maybe the aliens brought their pets with them?” He joked.



The Voxel system warbled a different alarm, causing Lt Williams to jerk the controls to the side. The Sparrowhawk jumped sideways out of the way of any incoming fire, but nothing appeared. Lt Williams studied the Voxel screen closer and saw the movement had stopped, replaced with a large energy signature. “Thompson, what do you think?” Lt Williams asked, confused.



There was a long silence before Ensign Thompson answered. “It looks like they stopped and started dumping energy into a spot in the middle of the three moving blips. I can’t see anything visually so it’s not aimed up, unless they’re using something outside the visible spectrum.”



“Outside the visible spectrum,” Lt Williams asked skeptically.



“Like lasers or something,” Ensign Thompson answered caustically.



Lt Williams thought about it for a moment. There were a lot of new things he and the Navy hadn’t seen before in this engagement, so a ground-based weapon system using lasers outside the visible spectrum wasn’t out of the question. Before he could open up the comms, a PDF pilot called in.



“Charlie to Control. We’ve got something strange on the ground here. There’s a large energy signature under the canopy, but we can’t see anything. We’re gonna do a flyover and see if we can pick up any emissions.”



“Negative, Charlie,” Lt Cdr Jeffrey ordered. “All the PDF birds are to return to base for further orders. There’s a Stellar Marine general taking over the show, we’re switching to defending the spaceport. Navy pilots, thanks for the assistance in slowing the bugs down; you can go back to taking orders from the Navy again.”



There was a brief pause before another PDF pilot came over the comms. “Wait, we’re just gonna let the Navy and Stellars take all the credit for killing the bugs?”



“We did plenty,” Lt Cdr Jeffrey said in a conciliatory tone. “But we don’t have the resources to keep fighting like this, and they’ve brought a Marine Expeditionary Brigade. I’d rather they take the brunt of the fighting; we’ve lost too many good men and women today.”



“Roger that, returning to base,” replied the PDF pilot dejectedly.



Lt Williams waited for the other PDF pilots to confirm their orders, only hearing a couple more before there was a long silence. Then Delta four-seven called in.



“Control, this is Delta four-seven, we are switching back to Navy comms.”



“Copy that,” the Crescent ATC replied curtly.



The two Bravo wing pilots called in and got the same response before it was Lt Williams’ turn.



“Wonder if they’d even notice we were gone,” Ensign Thompson growled.



“Probably not, but we’ve got a reputation to uphold,” Lt Williams answered with a sly grin. “Control, this is Delta three-five. It’s been fun, but we gotta run. Switching back to Navy comms.”



There was a longer than usual pause before the Crescent ATC answered dryly, “Copy that.”



“Reputation, eh?” Ensign Thompson muttered as Lt Williams switched frequencies.



“Can’t let them have all the fun,” Lt Williams answered cheekily. He keyed the mic and called up to *Hermes*, “Big Bird, this is Delta three-five. PDF Control has released us back to orbital control. I’m currently holding station near one of the alien LZs with no Phantoms and low on BBs. Requesting orders.”



“Roger that, Delta three-five,” answered the *Hermes* Air Control Officer. “We’re watching you on sensors. What is your fuel status?”



Lt Williams smiled. The PDF might have forgotten about them as the circled a random spot of the planet, but their own ACO had probably been tracking them the entire time. “Big Bird, we have sixty percent fuel on board.”



“Copy that. Standby for relief, then come in to reload,” *Hermes*’ ACO said.



“Roger that,” Lt WIlliams answered, relieved.



“I hope they show up soon,” Ensign Thompson mumbled.



“I’ll go super-sonic as soon as they get here,” Lt Williams answered, only half-joking. He would be glad to get out of atmosphere as well, if for different reasons. Moments after he’d spoken, a familiar voice came over the comms.



“Delta three-five, this is Echo one-niner, we are approaching your location. ETA is one minute.”



Lt Williams smiled at the sound of the cheery female lieutenant. “Roger that, Echo one-niner. Watch out for ground fire, these bugs are pretty territorial.”



“Don’t I know it, amigo,” Echo one-niner answered. “Those troopships got my wingman.”



“Sorry to hear that,” Lt Williams answered. “They almost smoked us too. We got lucky.”



Ensign Thompson snorted. “Don’t forget to warn her about the strange energy emission,” he cautioned.



“My gunner wants me to warn you about a strange energy reading coming from under the canopy,” Lt Williams called over the comms. “We can’t see anything, but it might be running off three alien vehicles or power sources they dragged into the jungle down here.”



“I heard something like that a bit ago,” Echo one-niner answered. “The corvettes can see it from high orbit, but it seems to be concentrated on the ground. Nothing is coming up as far as they can tell.”



“Good to know,” Lt Williams answered. He caught movement on the Voxel screen out of the corner of his eye, and when he looked he saw two blue blips of friendly IFFs approaching from low orbit. “I’ve got you on scopes. Recommend you swing well clear of the alien LZ. I don’t know the range on their AA, but if it’s repurposed defense turrets it should be able to hit upper atmo.”



“Copy that, we’ll take the scenic route,” Echo one-niner answered.



Lt Williams watched Echo one-niner and her wingman on the Voxel scope as they came down to his altitude well away from the alien landing zone. There was still a fairly steady stream of dropships or drop pods coming down, with friendlies harassing them on the edge of Lt Williams’ scope. He figured they were just as wary of the capabilities of the aliens’ anti-air defenses as he was, and didn’t blame them for not pressing their attacks too close. He winced as a friendly IFF blinked out well within his scope range, and a moment later saw the thin trail of smoke marking the wreckage of a Sparrowhawk falling to the surface. There was nothing on the comms, so it had to have been another wing that had lost their bird. A chirp from his control screen informed him a friendly had entered ‘close’ proximity, and he checked the horizon for his relief. He saw Echo one-niner and another Sparrowhawk approaching from the opposite direction of the alien LZ and he spun his Sparrowhawk to point towards the approaching friendlies. 



The two approaching Sparrowhawks waggled their wings and Echo one-niner came over the comms again, “Delta three-five, you are relieved. See you again soon.”



“Save some bugs for me,” he answered, putting the Sparrowhawk in a shallow climb and accelerating swiftly.



Echo one-niner laughed in response, and settled into a hover aimed towards the aliens, while her wingman split off and took up station several kilometers away.



Lt Williams waited until they were halfway to the edge of the Voxel scope before he put the Sparrowhawk into a near vertical climb and firewalled the thrusters. The acceleration felt good after an hour of hovering, and he achieved low orbit quickly. As they got further from the surface, more of the orbital combat was displayed on the Voxel screen, and Williams was surprised at how many alien craft were headed to the surface. There were long lines of what had to be dropships going towards the surface, outnumbering the friendly IFFs by at least ten to one. *How long has this been going on?* Williams wondered. The alien mothership was not on the scope, but he figured it had to be because it was too far away. That reminded him to turn on the homing receiver for *Hermes*. Since he’d been in visual range during the beginning of the battle he hadn’t really needed it; but now that he was a fair distance away from the streams of aliens headed for the surface he couldn’t see any friendly warships visually or on his Voxel scope. The receiver gave him the heading towards *Hermes*, and he adjusted course accordingly. 



As the carrier came into visual range, he turned and called over his shoulder to Ensign Thompson, “Glad to be back in space, old man?”



“I’ll be happier when we’re back at Alvarado,” grumbled Ensign Thompson.



“Me too,” Lt Williams answered, turning his attention to docking procedures.

  


It took another half hour for the Marines to break through the alien defenders. Predictably it was Captain Frank that achieved the breakthrough, directing the Marines of two platoons, plus the five originally from his own platoon, against the alien defenders blocking the passage. Captain Frank pushed himself to the very limit of his combat armor’s air supply, receiving a buddy boost from another Marine after the last alien collapsed under the combined weight of fire from three platoons worth of machine guns. Then they pushed up, reaching the opening where the passage widened out into what LtCol Dubois suspected was a launch bay. It was not what she had pictured, as Captain Frank looked around to give everyone in the Combat Control Center an idea of what they had found. It was a long tube with crenelated walls leading from the exterior hull into the bowels of the alien vessel. It was wide enough that Captain Frank’s helmet-mounted lights just barely reached all the way across the tube’s diameter. Captain Frank personally crawled to the exterior opening to place a beacon on the alien’s hull to guide Bisons and Buffaloes to their location. The opening looked wide enough to fit two Sparrowhawks side by side, or a Bison armored boarding shuttle with ease. Captain Frank led the three platoons back the other way, reminded periodically by the Marine Combat Coordinator of his low oxygen supply.



“Send a Bison down this tube and I’ll refill my air tanks,” Captain Frank replied to the Combat Coordinator's warning. “I’m going to stick with my men and see the job done.”



LtCol Dubois figured she’d have to have a talk with Captain Frank about following directions from Control, but now was not the time. His success was buying him a lot of leniency, as even the Combat Coordinator didn’t push the issue. LtCol Dubois watched as Captain Frank and the Marines crawled along the walls of the launch tube toward the interior of the alien vessel. The tension in the Combat Control Center was almost palpable as the Marines pulled themselves along. LtCol Dubois dreaded the appearance of alien drop pods or some other craft. An alien craft launching from the hive ship could kill the Marines if there wasn’t enough clearance between the Marines and the launch tube walls. In fact, with the number of alien craft leaving the hive ship, she was surprised none had flown past Captain Franks and his Marines yet.



“Control, this is Whiskey niner,” came the voice of a Bison pilot. “I’m at the beacon, but I don’t see an opening. Are you sure there isn’t a blast door or something?”



“Standby,” the Combat Coordinator told the pilot, then switched to Captain Frank. “Captain Frank, can you verify the launch tube does not have a covering? I have a Bison at the beacon but he can’t see the tube.”



The view of Captain Frank’s helmet cam spun, making LtCol Dubois a little dizzy as he pivoted to look back down the tube. “Negative Control,” Captain Frank answered. “Tell him he’s lined up perfectly. I can see his landing lights in the center of the opening.”



LtCol Dubois could see it too. The chin-mounted spotlights on the Bison were visible near the floor of the launch tube, while the faint glow of the cockpit lights could be seen near the center of the tube.



“Whiskey niner, you should be lined up perfectly with the opening,” the Combat Coordinator told the pilot.



“Yeah, I can’t see any opening,” the pilot answered. “Just hull plating, or whatever this thing is made of.”



The Combat Coordinator looked questioningly over his shoulder at LtCol Dubois.



LtCol Dubois shook her head. “Have someone go out and guide him in. I don’t want to lose another Bison, especially not to something like this.”



The Combat Coordinator nodded, switching back to Captain Frank. “Captain, I need you to send a couple marines down to guide the pilot in. There’s some sort of visual barrier preventing him from seeing the opening.”



Captain Frank shook his head, and LtCol Dubois could imagine his annoyance at the delay. He wasn’t the most patient officer.



“Copy that,” Captain Frank finally answered. “Hernandez, O’Reilly, go guide the bird in. Apparently he’s as blind as a bat.”



LtCol Dubois scowled, making a mental note to chide Captain Frank about staying professional on the comms.  



The two privates began crawling back towards the exterior hull, while the rest of Captain Frank’s boarding party moved on. They had only gone on for a minute when the helmet cam showed the edge of the launch tube drop away steeply. Almost immediately all the marines cut their helmet lights, and the camera switched to IR view. Even with IR mode engaged, visibility was poor, but there was a lot of movement. LtCol Dubois caught herself leaning closer to the screen, trying to make out the fuzzy shapes moving around and she straightened up. Just as she was about to ask what she was looking at, hoping the Combat Coordinator could see it better from his closer position, a bright flare lit up the camera view. The camera’s automatic settings struggled to adjust between the nearly lightless space and the bright green plume of thruster exhaust coming from an alien craft latched onto one of the walls.



“Control,” Captain Frank called. “We’ve found a hangar I think. Looks like they’re preparing to launch a landing craft or something, you’d better warn that Bison to get out of the way.”



“Copy,” the Combat Coordinator responded, switching frequencies in an instant. “Whiskey niner, there’s a hostile vessel about to exit the launch tube. Move away to avoid a collision.”



LtCol Dubois watched the view from Captain Frank’s helmet cam as several more thrusters turned on revealing the cavernous hangar area. She clasped her hands behind her back, watching with growing anxiety as Captain Frank and his marines crawled out of the launch tube and down the walls of the hangar. *If they all leave at once, there’s a good chance they’ll hit some of the Marines,* she thought. She whispered a silent prayer for the Marines to get far enough away from the launch tube so they wouldn’t be caught in the thruster wash.



“I hope Captain Frank remembers he sent two Marines to the opening of the launch tube,” Major Jameson commented quietly.



LtCol Dubois’ heart skipped a beat. She’d forgotten about the two privates going to guide the Bison in, and she looked over at the holographic map. It didn’t show the individual Marines, so she had no way of knowing where they were. The Combat Coordinator was busy with guiding a Buffalo to a casualty evacuation point, and LtCol Dubois wasn’t going to distract him from recovering a whole squad for the sake of two marines. All she could do was hope Captain Frank warned the two privates in time.



The camera view screen glowed as the alien thrusters increased power, the crenelated walls of the hangar coming into sharp focus on the screen. The view swung around to the interior of the hangar as Captain Frank turned his head. At least a dozen alien landing craft were lifting off the deck, the first one turning to line up with the launch tube. Captain Frank suddenly seemed to remember the two marines he’d sent to guide in the Bison, because he called out over the squad comms, “Hernandez! O’Reilly! Find cover! Drop ships are coming out!”



LtCol Dubois didn’t hear any response, since the squad comms weren’t relayed to the Combat Control Center, but Captain Frank turned his attention back to the alien dropships. “Control, I count a dozen dropships. They look about as large as a Buffalo, and I think there are other connecting hangars. There are large openings in the interior walls.”



“Roger that,” replied the Combat Controller. “Can you give any estimate as to the number of aliens aboard the dropships?”



“Negative, command,” replied Captain Frank. “It was too dark, and now they seem to have cleared the deck- Hold on, they’re moving.”



The first dropship shot past the Marines down the launch tube, and the camera jerked as the other dropships hurtled past Captain Frank’s helmet and the captain ducked. LtCol Dubois watched the view screen as the glow of the dropships’ thrusters faded in the launch tube, then Captain Frank spun back towards the hangar interior. The view was pitch black for a moment, then a faint glow revealed a large opening in the far wall of the hangar. As they watched, more dropships appeared and floated across to the launch tube before accelerating out of the hive ship.

“Command,” Captain Frank called, unconsciously raising his voice over the non-existent  thruster noise. “I think we’re watching an evacuation. I’ll try to slow them down, but we may need some heavier firepower.”



“Negative captain,” the Combat Controller replied. “Your weapons will be ineffective. I’ll relay the information to the Navy and have them intercept. Keep pushing in and find where they’re loading the dropships while I work to get you resupply.”



“Roger Command,” Captain Frank replied.



LtCol Dubois scanned the other screens as Captain Frank and his Marines began climbing down into the large hangar area. About half of the Marine boarding parties were engaged in firefights with alien warriors. A glance at the holographic map showed LtCol Dubois that all the boarding parties were gradually converging on the same area of the alien hive ship. Listening to the chatter from the Combat Controller and his subordinates, LtCol Dubois could tell they weren’t being directed that way intentionally. It seemed that almost the forward half of the alien hive ship had been cleared. LtCol Dubois wondered how much of the rest of the vessel was hangar bays, and where the living quarters were. The holographic map still showed a steady stream of bogeys coming from three different locations on the alien hive ship; but now there were bogeys coming from a couple more locations. She turned back to Captain Frank’s view, watching the shadows shift as more alien dropships moved overhead to the launch tube. The Marines were making slow progress across the hangar, but the systems aboard *Hermes* were mapping the interior of the hive ship as the Marines moved.



The ship phone buzzed, and Major Jameson picked it up. 



“Combat Control,” he said. After a moment he held the phone out to LtCol Dubois. “It’s the admiral,” he told her.



“Dubois,” she said as she put the receiver to her ear.



“*Persephone* and her escorts just arrived in system,” Admiral Vong said, wasting no time with pleasantries. “General Strong wants you to go over and brief him on the situation personally. Can you leave Major Jameson in command here?”



“Yes sir,” LtCol Dubois replied. Her agreement wasn’t just because the admiral was requesting she leave Jameson in command. Major Jameson had spent his entire career on navy ships commanding Stellar Marines in boarding actions and the occasional surface deployment. In contrast, LtCol Dubois had earned her rank in armoured units and had only been given command of an MEU assigned to *Hermes* because of the vagaries of peacetime service.



“Good,” Admiral Vong said. “I have a launch preparing to bring you over as soon as you can make your way to the hangar deck. We’ll see you when you get back.”



“Aye aye, sir,” LtCol Dubois answered as she heard the line click off. She handed the phone back to Major Jameson and unconsciously straightened her uniform.



“Good news?” Inquired Major Jameson as he replaced the ship phone.



“General Strong is here with *Persephone*,” LtCol Dubois answered. “He wants me to brief him on the situation, so I’m leaving you in charge of the rest of the boarding action.”



“Jolly good show,” Jameson answered, snapping a quick salute. 



LtCol Dubois couldn’t help smiling at how easily Major Jameson transitioned from a supporting role to being in charge of the operation as she left the Combat Control Center and headed to the Hangar Deck. He hadn’t even bothered setting down his mug of tea. She found a T6000 runabout launch warming its thrusters in the appropriate hangar. She’d only been in this hangar and the hangar her Marine craft shared with the Search and Rescue Pelicans. LtCol Dubois had no reason to go in the hangars reserved for *Hermes*’ strike craft, and consequently had never gotten lost or turned around on the expansive hangar deck. The launch’s crew acknowledged her presence as she climbed up the short ramp into the passenger area and settled in. There was already a naval commander strapped in onboard, his name tag introducing him as ‘Toffy.’



“Commander,” LtCol Dubois said in way of greeting.



“Colonel,” replied Commander Toffy, somewhat nervously. After a moment of silence he asked, “Are you going over to *Persephone* too?”



“Yes,” LtCol Dubois answered. “I’m supposed to brief General Strong on the aliens.”



“I’m part of the admiral’s staff. I’ll be the liaison between General Strong and Admiral Vong, coordinating assets and such,” Commander Toffy said, confirming LtCol Dubois’ supposition.



“Good to know we’ll be coordinating with someone from *Hermes*,” LtCol Dubois said, not sure what else to say.



Commander Toffy went silent, and both officers sat quietly while the pilots finished their preflight checks. Then the ramp closed, sealing the compartment and they lifted off the deck. The ride was only five minutes or so, spent in a slightly uncomfortable silence. As soon as the launch touched down in the *Persephone*’s spacious hangar, LtCol Dubois unstrapped the safety harness and stood. She was more comfortable than most Marines with being flown around, but she was never quite at ease as a passenger. Conversely, Commander Toffy seemed nervous about his assignment as fleet liaison to General Strong and was still untangling himself from the safety harness when the ramp lowered to reveal a female Marine lieutenant waiting for them.



“If you’ll follow me,” the Marine lieutenant said crisply, snapping a salute to LtCol Dubois and Cdr Toffy.



LtCol Dubois saluted back, looking around the spacious hangar as she followed the lieutenant. It was crammed with Buffaloes and armored vehicles of every description, all being made ready for deployment. Commander Toffy hurried to catch up, surveying the bustling hangar with a mixture of awe and professional admiration. The three officers boarded a lift, and were soon headed up to *Persephone*’s command deck where General Strong would direct his Marines to counter the alien invasion.

1jc4c0h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jc4c0h,🚨 Depop is Failing Buyers & Sellers 🚨,"I wanted to share two awful experiences I’ve had on Depop recently, showing how Depop protects dishonest sellers while completely ignoring buyers—even when clear evidence is provided. On top of that, they flagged MY account for telling the truth, while the actual scammers face no consequences.

1️⃣ The Cut Bodysuit Scam
	•	I purchased a Skims lace top that was listed as “excellent condition.”
	•	When I received it, I realized it was actually a bodysuit that had been cut into a crop top, leaving a raw, unfinished hem—which was never disclosed.
	•	The item also had visible stains, which were not disclosed in the listing.
	•	When I confronted the seller, they admitted it was originally a bodysuit—but only AFTER I received it.
	•	Depop denied my refund request, falsely claiming the alteration was “visible” in the listing, even though the seller never mentioned it.
	

2️⃣ Seller Blocked Me & Relisted My Item for Double the Price
	•	I purchased a top at full price, and the seller refunded my order claiming they spilled coffee on it.
	•	Immediately after, they blocked me and relisted the exact same top for TWICE the price.
	•	When I left an honest review explaining this, Depop removed my feedback and flagged MY account—but did nothing to the seller who scammed me.

Depop’s Absurd Response: “You’re Flagged, But You Did Nothing Wrong?”

Depop’s response to my feedback removal makes absolutely no sense:
➡ “Your account has been flagged for leaving feedback that broke our terms.”
➡ “Your feedback did NOT directly go against our Terms of Service or Feedback Policy, but we removed it anyway to be ‘fair’ to both parties.”

How does this make sense? How am I flagged if I didn’t actually break any rules?
And how is this “fair” when the seller lied, blocked me, and price-gouged the item—but they faced ZERO consequences? Nothing about my experience is fair.

🚨 Depop Needs to Be Held Accountable 🚨

I have now:
✔ Reported Depop to the FTC for failing to uphold buyer protection.
✔ Continued pushing for answers, only to be ignored and dismissed.

Depop is allowing blatant seller misconduct while silencing buyers who speak up. If you’re thinking about spending your money on this platform, BE CAREFUL, because their “protection” only seems to work one way.

Why is my account flagged for telling the truth while actual scammers are protected? Has anyone else experienced this kind of bias from Depop?",5,1742070434.0,Depop,4,0.78,False

I'd really like to figure out a interesting way to accent the material itself.

I suppose I could just alternate some fittings with copper and brass, maybe put a finish on them and get some contrast in there.  But when I visualize that in my head it just seems cheesy.

There are a metric effton of ""making with the steampunk aesthetic"" books on amazon and while they all seem like they've got some coffee table appeal, I'm really looking for ""yeah this is how you DO this"" without going the route of cosplay eva foam stuff.

I've been pen palling for nearly 10 years now and am excited to add some new friends to my roster. I really enjoy writing and receiving letters. I collect cute stationery on my travels and use fountain pens for extra fun. 

A little about me: I'm 29F living in Florida. I moved here to start my PhD last July and am working really hard and enjoying it. My focus is on inequality in the coffee supply chain. I worked in coffee for 6 years before entering this program, so a more sustainable supply chain is my passion. I recently founded a new ethical pricing project where roasters commit to transparently contributing a higher percentage of the retail price to a period justice project in Burundi, where the coffee is from. I have 4 roasters on board so far and am growing, which is very exciting! 

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, knitting, cooking & baking, and drinking too much tea and coffee. I also love doing kitchen experiments and brewing my old mead, making naturally fermented sodas, and canning jams and pickled things. 

I love hearing about the things you are passionate about, your travels, your plans for the future, and, of course, seeing pet photos.

I know this is an embarrassing number and some could argue why I bought the 9barista in first place, but I wanted to give it a serious try to see if I could get some decent Flat whites at home. In the end it never stood a chance against Hario/V60 or Aero-press. I'm pretty sure the 9barista is better off with someone else.

1jc419h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jc419h/need_perspective/,Need Perspective,"I really need some outside perspective involving setting boundaries. No real names are used but this post will be long and I need to put in trigger warnings for child abuse, child SA, other various forms of trauma and what is involved. I understand that this is heavy and not the funny material that people love to watch in videos. I have just truly appreciated advice and perspective from the commenters in this thread from what Charlotte covers in videos. This has helped me in many ways and in many situations.

I (40 F) was raised in a cult to sadistically abusive parents. The cult was the one covered in the Shiney, Happy People documentary and trust me when I say, that documentary is accurate and it was very surreal and validating when it came out to see what was my real time childhood/young adulthood in a documentary. I was in the student choir shown and spent time at two of the training centers mentioned.  I'm the second oldest and oldest daughter in a relatively large family so yes, I have a lot of siblings. My parents fell into the category of ""homeschool"" parents that lied flat out to the state that they were in fact, homeschooling and it was used as the way to keep us isolated and quiet.

As the oldest daughter in the cult, that also associated with the Quiverfull movement and complete patriarchy, while I was taught the basics, most of my ""education"" was on how to run a home, raise children and take care of a husband and of course, I was supposed to homeschool any future children and leave the size of my future family up to God as birth control was sinful. I was used as slave labor for my parents and forced to take on many of the responsibilities of raising many of my younger siblings. To excuse their actions, my parents spun the narrative that we were all super rebellious children and deserved what we got.

Some examples of the abuses from my parents, that I feel is important to the context, are:

Long and brutal beating sessions with the belt were multiple times daily. I personally, counted during these sessions as a coping mechanism and usually would lose count between 100-150 ish. On our butts and the bottoms of our feet were their favorite places although many times I remember being curled in the fetal position on the floor while the belt was coming down anywhere and everywhere (depending on how much of a rage they were in). If it was the bottoms of our feet, my mother would sit or stand on us so we couldn't jerk away and if we ever screamed, it started over.

Food was withheld for many days at a time. The longest I remember going without food was 7 days but I was always hungry. If we got caught ""stealing"" their food or it was even suspected we were trying, we would be force fed Ipecac to make us vomit. Since my mother installed locks on the pantry and marked food in the refrigerator, successfully sneaking things out was nearly impossible for years. I did still find ways periodically, but most of the time I was forced to swallow the Ipecac, I would be vomiting pure stomach acid on an already starving stomach.

Many, many nights we were forced to stay up all night either working on school work we had not done during the day (because we were never given time to do it) or deep cleaning the house and I was always exhausted and never rested. If we went to bed without permission, our mother would come rampaging and screaming into our rooms with the belt flying and usually, if I didn't move fast enough to get out before she got to the side of my bed, she would yank me out by my hair while using the belt in the other hand. Many, many Sunday mornings I was forced to drink black coffee so I wouldn't fall asleep in church to ""give her away.""

Many nights throughout my childhood, one or more of us would be kicked out of the house. When kicked out, we would only be allowed what we were wearing when it happened. So many nights in the middle of winter we would be starving and left locked out with no blankets, coats or anything.

I have memories that dance around SA from my father, but nothing that is solid proof. I mention it simply to say that my trauma responses and strong and the surrounding memories, 3 separate counselors/trauma therapists have said they point straight to it. How my brain and body respond to my father means he is unsafe for me.

There were so many more physical abuses that were done, but these are the ones more important to mention here. This doesn't include the mental, phycological, Spiritual and emotional abuse that was also happening at the same time. An example of the Spiritual being that my parents had a Bible verse to excuse literally everything. They were/are master manipulators and that included manipulating the Bible.

As I grew into a young adult, they made it their mission to ruin my future life. I could give example after example, but I had to fight through everything because I was ""supposed"" to stay in their home till my father picked my future husband and that was supposed to be it. So every single solitary thing I did to try and get out, I had to fight for. They tried to get me fired from my first job, the actively tried to sabotage any college attempts and took it so far as to try and sabotage my marriage and wedding to my now husband (43m) because he wasn't someone they could control, my father didn't pick him and \*horrors\* he had/has amazing parents and was raised in public school.

After my husband and I were married, we spent several of the first few years housing my siblings and helping them escape one by one. So, to bring it to present. My husband and I have 5 of our own children but even that was something I had to work through in therapy. We were done after our third and in spite of steps taken to ensure that fact, I got pregnant with twins when our now 9 year old was 3. For reference, my children are 15, 14, 9, 6 & 6.

It was when the twins were 1.5 years old that we FINALLY went no contact with my parents. I had wanted to the day I got married, but they still had quite a few of my minor siblings under their control and to be able to continue seeing them, I had to play ball to a certain extent. But you bet that I was counting down the days till my youngest sibling came of age and I was able to cut ties finally.

What I haven't explained yet is how hard it has been to parent with PTSD and CPTSD (yes, I've been medically diagnosed) and be the cycle breaker that I want. It is a ""duh"" to not physically abuse my children. But for all 15 nearly 16 years so far, I've nearly fallen into bed in utter exhaustion every night from the mental challenges of sometimes, minute by minute choosing to break a cycle. My child does this thing, I'm triggered, force myself to respond in a way I wasn't taught and isn't natural. It was 6-7ish years into our marriage before I even knew what a trauma trigger was and that I was living in a constant stream of them. For years, there were nightly nightmares, daily panic attacks and flashbacks. I didn't even have the information to understand that I was raised in a cult till my second born was a toddler.

Also, with my second born was a baby, I had reported my parents to child protective services and was trying to get custody of my 2 youngest siblings still there. I had to take my 2 oldest down to that office several times, submit a statement and answer so many questions only to have a social worker look me in the eyes and tell me that she had enough on my parents to remove the boys that day with an emergency court order, but that they were choosing not to. I still don't understand, but the fallout for me then was that my parents were able to regain control of the narrative and I lost the ability to see my siblings for quite a while, I was called a liar by many people we had gone to church with since I was a baby and my reputation in our city was destroyed.

Okay, boundaries. While I had no understanding of exactly how horrific the abuse I was living was growing up, I at least understood as a teen that I hated my parents and couldn't wait to grow up and get away from them. I assumed my siblings all felt the same. It never once occurred to me that siblings weren't also waiting till everyone was of age to also go no contact. At first, when I called around to siblings to let them know I was about to, they all seemed supportive but several started down the line of ""they've changed"" and ""I think you will be surprised about how they respond to your letter.""

For context, we had avoided seeing them around Christmas knowing that I was working on getting the courage to actually send them a letter. They sent us a LOT (they love to manipulate with money) of Christmas gifts all of which we returned to them the following January with my letter of no contact.

I knew very well they hadn't changed and they had been trying to gaslight me about my childhood for years and had attempted to continue that campaign with my oldest 2 children. As I knew, my parents responded exactly as I knew they would. Blame shifting, denial, etc. When everyone else realized what happened, siblings started backpedalling and not being supportive. I was told I was lying about my diagnosis's, asked when I was going to ""get over"" myself so the whole family could go back to pretending everything was fine. I was hit with ""when are you just going to forgive them?"" and ""well, we've just chosen to forgive.""

I was livid, felt totally betrayed and was sent on an emotional spiral downward where I nearly ended my life. My husband and precious children kept me here. Literally. They are amazing. Around this same time, My parents started using the large church they had moved to  to hide after I reported them, to support and fund them going overseas as missionaries.

Important to note, in the narsscistic family structure, I had started to learn at that time that I was the scapegoat. My parents had blamed everything on me growing up, down to me getting additional abuse if my younger siblings did something because ""I was the bad example."" Now, I was being blamed for causing a rift in the family. If I could just ""forgive"" and get over myself, everyone could ignore the horrific and we could continue to ""function"" as a dysfunctional family. The problem was and is that for my safety and for my children's safety, I simply couldn't anymore. I have been in some sort of therapy since right after I got married and trauma therapy for at least 6 of those years. I was fighting day in and day out to change the narrative with my sweet children. Plus, I have 5 children and one of those is special needs, even without a traumatic childhood, I would be exhausted. I was in trauma therapy before I went no contact with my parents, but there were so many things that I could not move forward on till they were removed from my life.

To the current issue. My older brother and I lived this hell together for many years. We hated each other growing up and part of that was because my mother did things to purposely make us hate each other. Keep us all fighting and we can't come up against her. I have plenty of examples but this is already a novel. I a texting conversation between the 2 of us not too long after I hit my lowest point mentally, I was so very angry and hurt. I did not (still don't to be honest) understand why he was so insistent upon continuing a relationship with our parents and I angrily told him that I couldn't trust him with anything about my family because of it. We both said so many hurtful things to each other in that fight and I really wish we'd never tried to talk over text. Here I need to make VERY CLEAR. My brother is NOT the enemy and I do NOT see him as such. We were both abused so horrifically, we shouldn't be alive. We all are dealing with our trauma very differently and I'm working very hard at respecting where each of my siblings are. That being said, I finally ended our text fight when I told him about the possible SA and his response with dismissive and downplaying of it. He's been in the military since the end of 2001 (yes, he saw so awful stuff in the middle east after 9/11). The way he was when we were younger was to refuse to acknowledge feelings. Feelings meant weakness. I don't see that this has changed. I flew into a rage and ended the conversation before I said something I would really regret.

I've been avoiding him since. Responding to texts with the bare minimum. For months I was too angry to even think about a response, and then I probably waited longer than I should have to finally address it. But I finally did last week. I sent an email to him, CC ing his wife and my husband so that the four of us would all be on the same page moving forward. I bluntly called out the hurtful things he said and told him we needed to work this out and them (this is important) said ""these are my boundaries moving forward"" followed by a list of what they are.. The top of the list being, my no contact with our parents means I need a promise from those who choose to still communicate with them, that nothing about me or my family ever be told to them.

To give as complete a picture as possible. My plan for this email had been to screenshot our text fight thread and go through the texts circling what was so hurtful that he said. When I went to my phone however, all the ones that had things that needed addressing were missing. All of my responses were still there and some of the other ones from him in the middle of the fight or before that were there. I don't know what happened to them, but I wrongly assumed he deleted them and made that accusation in this first email.

His response was to ignore my boundaries and the fact that he said hurtful things and hit back with basically saying I was clearly just bitter and he would be there when I decided to deal with that. His wife (they have been married a year longer than my husband and me) sent a very angry email ( I was grateful for it and told her that because I felt like she was finally telling me things that she needed to) saying a lot of things that are private between the 2 of them so I'm not sharing them here, but broadly, they were about how our trauma has affected their marriage over the years and and that she sees how much we all hurt each other and trigger each other, the cause obviously being our parents. My brother also sent me the screenshots of our text thread with a ""here's the messages so if you are going to hate me, at least you know what you are hating me for.""

After reading through all our back and forth, I realized how much I had to apologize for and that I now needed to apologize for accusing him of deleting the texts. Which I did. I sent a long email back with a quite a few apologies. But in both of my brother's responses, he was still not promising to keep info about my family from our parents, but still didn't acknowledge how much he hurt me.  So I tried re-explaining the hurt and my boundaries again.

To this email, my SIL responded that she absolutely promised to not say anything to our parents and mentioned that she agreed they are not safe and expressed her wish to never see or speak to them again. My brother's response to this is why we are here. He basically thanked me for my apologies, restated that we are where we are because I never clearly stated my boundaries in our original text fight (he's right, I didn't. I was too hurt and angry at the time to say things coherently), then ended the email saying ""today is a new day"" (which I take to mean that he expects me to no longer address what he said was so hurtful as if I do, he can label me bitter again. I also going off the fact that I've rarely gotten an apology from anyone in the family for hurting me with that same excuse. We move on, we shove it under the rug and if you mention it again, clearly, you are the bitter one. Then he said ""What are your boundaries? What do you want from me.""

I really don't know how to respond to this. I just listed the answers to those questions in both of the previous emails. My SIL understood the answers and I could not have been clearer. Also, I am aware that this is triggering me because the way he worded this whole email sounds like it came straight from my father. Like I could put my father's name at the bottom and had I not seen my brother's name first, I'd have promised my father wrote it. I just told him my boundaries. I just told him what I need from him. Our father is a narssacist for sure, and we both learned how to manipulate with the best, It's something I've been actively fighting for years. I feel like these questions that I've clearly listed out are trying to make me talk in circles. He still won't apologize and acknowledge how hurtful his words were.

I've tried to take a step back and not do what my SIL accurately stated we tend to do, assume the worst of each other. But I don't want to go re-explain all the things I've spent 2 emails explaining. I've been in defense mode with my own family since going no contact with our parents because for a time, ALL of them made it clear they thought I was causing too much drama by making that choice. Just the first two emails and the first few responses made me lose quite a few nights of sleep, laying awake questioning everything I said, if I could have said it better, should I just ignore the hurt, am I actually bitter and don't realize it, should I have said this instead, etc.  Also, if I have to beg an apology out of him, I don't want it anymore. From my point of view, if someone I claim to love came to me and told me I hurt them, I would apologize and try to make it right. Someone should ask my children how many times in a day I apologize to them. I'm just done with playing defense in this family. Our parents should be in prison, not on the mission field and everyone knows it.  So yeah, I don't know how to respond to my brother at this point and could really use some outside perspective. I feel backed into a corner where if I bring up again that his words hurt, he can/will just write me off as bitter again. Due to his trauma and how he handles it, am I being too hard on him to expect him to apologize for his hurtful words? And as long as he promises to hold the boundary line, will I just have to let that go? My husband told me he can't give me an unbiased opinion anymore than my SIL can give my brother one. They both had no clue what they were signing up for and have had front row seat for 19 and 20ish years respectively to each of us working through our significant trauma. My husband said his first instinct is to protect me so that's going to color is view.

And to note, I am not bitter. I forgave my parents a long time ago, this wasn't for them. This was for me, my health and for my husband and my children. However, I'm allowed to have moments of anger, I'm allowed to feel hurt. Sometimes it's a daily choice to forgive my parents yet again for a certain thing that comes up. I've been through so many layers of this onion and I think I've hit the worst, then we hit another layer and I have to go through all the stages again.  I'm just so confused.",1,1742069624.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,0.99,False

By James Taylor
December 30, 2009
-allaboutjazz.com

Ocote Soul Sound is the brainchild of two incredibly accomplished musicians, who continue to operate just under the radar;one more project to occupy the diminishingly available time of guitarist Adrian Quesada and flautist Martin Perna. With roots in the otherworldly grooves of label mates and benefactors Thievery Corporation, Ocote Soul Sounds' Coconut Rock (ESL, 2009), builds on the band's ""Chicanos in Outer Space"" groove by adding a cinematic quality reminiscent of David Axelrod, Weather Report and other fusion era powerhouses.

Adrian Quesada is the man behind the bombastic funk of Grupo Fantasma and its alter ego, Brownout. When not leading those groups, performing at Super Bowl parties thrown by iconic genius Prince, and occasionally doubling as The Purple One's backing band at impromptu gigs in Austin, TX and Las Vegas, NV, the Austin, TX-based Quesada somehow finds time to share song ideas digitally with the never-stationary Perna. A founding member of the Afrobeat orchestra Antibalas, Perna has added his flute and saxophone to recordings from the likes of TV on the Radio, Scarlett Johansson and DJ Logic.

Coconut Rock is, by far, Ocote's best record to date, showcasing the growth of the band as, well, a band. Whereas 2007's The Alchemist Manifesto (ESL) was smoke-filled rooms and psilocybin dreams, Coconut Rock is dense layers of horns and percussion, Axelrod on vacation in Tijuana or Mandrill in the bomb shelter with Madlib. ""Vampires"" recalls the proto-raps of Gil Scott-Heron, ""The Return of the Freak"" shadows the pimp walk of Curtis Mayfield's ""Superfly.""

Both Quesada and Perna were kind enough to answer some questions for All About Jazz: Quesada in person at a coffee shop just minutes from the home-turned-studio where Grupo Fantasma is currently writing their next record; and Perna, true to form, via email. The History of Ocote Soul Sounds' roots go back to Perna's days working with the Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra, as they were called at the time, the name since shortened to Antibalas, in New York City. Ocote Soul Sounds was a name I came up with in 2001 when I started writing songs that didn't really fit in the rest of the Antibalas repertoire,"" Perna explains. ""It sort of became the umbrella name for little random stuff I did, from a 45 on Bobbito Garcia's Fruitmeat label to a digital folk EP that I made 100 copies of called Electric Tides. I would do two or three shows a year around that time in New York, backed by guys from Antibalas, The Dap Kings and El Michels Affair."" Ocote took on another phase in 2004 when I linked up with Adrian Quesada in Austin, and we put together material for an album. We had both done four or five songs independently, and put them together along with a few joint collaborations and we had an instant album 2005's El Niño y El Sol (ESL). 

It was unexpectedly well received and picked up by the Thievery Corporation guys for the ESL label. Because we really didn't know how this project would turn out, if we'd expand to a full band or not, it made sense to bill it as 'Ocote Soul Sounds and Adrian Quesada,'"" Quesada adds. ""It has a better ring than Martin Perna and Adrian Quesada. Still, when we perform live we just call it 'Ocote Soul Sounds.' Regardless of the name, the nexus of Ocote's sound is undeniably the inspiring, and almost freaky, musical connection between the group's two leaders. ""The most difficult thing is getting together,"" Perna says. ""Even though Adrian and I both theoretically live in Austin, our times here rarely overlap and our commitments here leave precious little time to get together. I think there is definitely some ESP happening between us because when we do get together in the studio, the ideas flow pretty freely and usually one of us is able to put the finishing touches on the other's ideas to make it a song we're happy with. 

Martin travels quite a bit so we don't spend all that much time in the same room. So he'll send me sketches he has via email,"" says Quesada. Which brings to mind an interesting dichotomy: while Ocote Soul Sounds compositions begin with the digital sharing of two musical minds via the web, the actual music looks back, not only to the Latin funk and soul explosion of the '60s and '70s, but much further back to the Yoruban chants and layers of polyrthythmic percussion that drive Coconut Rock. 
Like Perna's work promoting sustainable living alternatives, Ocote Soul Sounds music attempts to address the present by looking to the past for lessons on how to build a better future.

All of Ocote's records, if anything, have shown the growth of the band. Like their songs themselves, the group's albums have developed from sketches of what could potentially be, to fully orchestrated brilliance. The difference between Alchemist Manifesto and [the new one] is this one is more focused. El Nino y El Sol came together... magically? I don't really know how, a lot of it was already recorded by Martin. With The Alchemist Manifesto, we set out to record a lot more but because of scheduling it was hard to do so it ended up not as well thought out. It's a good record and I know a lot of people like it but it's a lot of stuff that was just laying around and sounded completely different on an album.""

 Coconut Rock is the record we've spent the most time on so I think the songs are fleshed out more. You mentioned David Axelrod, who did a lot of big arrangements and compositions where everything was real well thought out and super orchestrated. This is the first album where we actually had the time and the resources to actually flesh out ideas. So it's not just grooves, all the songs start with a groove but this is the first time we actually had the time to sit down and turn them into real songs, to call up our friends who play instruments we can't play. In that sense, this is the most composed record.""

""I wasn't going for that [Axelrod-like style] specificall,y although I do admire his productions, both under his own name and other stuff he did. Adrian definitely has a very cinematic ear and brings a lot of that aesthetic to the sound. In the back of my mind I am constantly thinking of the dancers, you can hear that in the 'Cockroach Peoples,' 'Coconut Rock' and 'Prince of Peace'

“Working within a community of musicians that includes members of Antibalas, Grupo Fantasma and Brownout, Perna and Quesada have had no problems finding experienced musicians to help them actualize their ideas. ""John Speice, who plays with the Austin-version of the live band, he played a huge part in this record,"" Quesada admits. ""We wanted to incorporate more of the live element and the way the band is sounding on this record and he is the one who came in and was the glue that pulled that together. He plays drums and percussion on almost every song so Coconut Rock has more of a live feel than the last few, where some of the drums were samples or random percussion that we could round up. He's really the third member on this record."" 

The biggest problem for Perna and Quesada seems to be the final step in the music making process, figuring out how in the world to play these songs live. ""Brownout, Grupo and Antibalas are such live machines, huge bands that beat you over the head with music. And because they come from a live setting, all three of those bands' music is based on getting people dancing,"" Quesada says. ""With Ocote, that need to get people dancing goes out the window, allowing us to do whatever we want really. The music has more of a cinematic quality because songs are built around sounds and not necessarily what works live.

""We don't play a lot of our songs live,"" Quesada jokes. ""But we have no sense of that when writing. Afterwards, we go back and figure out what we can play live. We just went on tour with Thievery Corporation again. They're more electronic-based and Martin and I come from a live background and little by little we're realizing that short of hiring an orchestra and taking all those people on tour with us, we're going to have to start using a sampler or computers. I love watching a live band trying to recreate the record. There is some material that is heavy on the studio production, and we've either chosen not to do it live or to do some sort of reduced version of it with the instrumentation we have live,"" Perna continues. At the band's most recent gig at the loungey 6th St. bar Momo's in, Austin, TX, that live set up consisted of two guitars, Quesada and Arturo Torres, bass, congas, the aforementioned John Speice on drums, Perna's flute and baritone sax, and a second saxophone. ""I've been learning Ableton Live and am going to experiment a little bit with integrating some pre-recorded stuff (both musical and ambient sounds) into the live set. If it can work organically with much drama, cool. If not, I'll leave it in the bag.""

Two years ago I had the pleasure of working with Adrian Quesada at the Fun Fun Fun Fest music festival in Austin. As Quesada's Grupo Fantasma shimmied their way through a silky smooth set of horn-heavy cumbia, salsa and funk, I stood at the back of the stage alongside Dead Milkmen lead singer Rodney Anonymous, his band having played a reunion show at the festival the night before. Rodney was ecstatic, literally freaking about this band ""playing the sort of Chicago funk my father used to listen to.""

After Grupo's set, I introduced the two, and Quesada returned Anonymous' elation with the admission that he could probably still play guitar to every Dead Milkemen song, himself a reformed skateboarding, trouble making punk rocker. What struck me most about this moment was the sort of inter-generational conversation that was going on: a punk rock icon praising a musician who is himself a child of the punk rock and hip hop movements for playing music that his father enjoyed. Again, looking to the past to make music for the future. The Ocote Way.

""Beyond digging deeper and straying from the obvious stuff that everyone is doing and listening to, what punk rock, and bands like the Dead Milkmen, showed me and my skate punk friends was the do-it-yourself approach,"" Quesada explains. ""I remember looking at album covers and realizing these guys had done this themselves, literally drawn the covers by hand. And the albums sounded shitty, I mean comparatively they just didn't have the same budget. What I took away from those years and that music was really taking it upon yourself to make things happen. Keeping that attitude. And also really the rawness, the rawness of that music, aesthetically the music was raw and had energy and all that stuff that's fun when you're young and causing trouble.""

""I think there are definitely a lot of our peers who are inspired by 60s and 70s aesthetics, from Dap Kings to El Michels to Grupo Fantasma and Brownout, to the West Coast guys like Connie Price, the Lions, Orgone,"" Perna adds. ""A lot of us grew up in the late '80s, early '90s on hip hop that was completely built on a lot of this old funk music. For me, that's what I liked most about the hip hop, it was always much less about the lyricism for me (with a few exceptions) and more about the beats. It was in X-Clan that I heard Fela Kuti for the first time. It was the saxophone hook in Pete Rocks ""Troy"" that made me want to play saxophone. When I started digging for records and buying mixtapes with the original music, I forgot about hip hop altogether. By that time sampling laws had changed anyway and a lot of hip hop's connection with music of the past was severed.""

Artists like Fela Kuti, Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, Sun Ra and Parliament/Funkadelic were the freaks and weirdoes of their era, much like the Rodney Anonymous' and Flavor Flav's of Perna and Quesada's adolescence. As music fans, something always draws us to artists who seem a little odd, the tortured genius or eccentric entertainer. ""The Return of the Freak"" as Perna puts it.

In addition to the punk rock aesthetic of Quesada, and the mutual love and admiration of the golden era late '80s hip-hop, Ocote's sound is peppered with the chants and percussion of Yoruban religion. ""A lot of the chanting that you hear on songs like 'Pan, Chamba y Techo' and 'Coconut Rock' comes from Perna's background in Yoruba. The origins of some of the vocals is obviously African, Yoruban, but the influence actually comes from 70s bands like Mandrill, bands that didn't have a lead singer, they just had a bunch of dudes who sang.""

The Future

With a solid band in place for the first time, Quesada must now find time to balance the ever-hectic schedule of Grupo Fantasma and Brownout with the touring demands of Ocote Soul Sounds.

""More and more I lean towards staying home and making records but it's hard these days, especially with bands the size of Grupo and Ocote, to make any money. You just have to play and play a lot,"" Quesada says. ""For me personally I like the fact that Grupo Fantasma and Ocote can kinda divide and conquer and play different parts of the country. Now there's an Ocote band and it's great 'cause we don't have to defer to any other band and its schedule. The band is growing in confidence and developing its own sound.""

No doubt, Coconut Rock is documentation of a band finally comfortable in its own skin, finally acknowledging its status as a ""real band,"" no longer a pet project of two staggeringly talented musicians with too many ideas in their heads and not enough outlets to explore them.

""Every musician who gets to a certain point in his/her journey begins to confront questions of identity, roots and core values,"" Perna reflects. ""I think that is where we are right now with the music. It is a challenge to try to articulate where we are at, where we are from, and were we want to go in our own words.""",2,1742069389.0,afrobeat,0,1.0,False
