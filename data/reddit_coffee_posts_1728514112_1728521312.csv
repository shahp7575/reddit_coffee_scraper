1g06ovb,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1g06ovb/sil_tried_to_ruin_my_wedding/,SIL tried to ruin my wedding ,"For context:
My husband (23) and I (24) decided it was best not to ask his sister (30) to be in our wedding. My brother and his brother were in the wedding, his brother's wife and sister's husband were not. This is because when his brother got married a few years back, SIL threw a major fit about their wedding being child-free and her son not being the ring bearer. The couple compromised and allowed the child at the reception. SIL's destructive behavior devastated my husband's family for years over the wedding, so much that they would show up at family gatherings to make an attempt and everyone would completely ignore and disregard them. The SIL brought her sick child to the wedding and did not dress up or attempt to look nice for pictures. So, we decided it was best to sit her out of the wedding party as we aren't that close with her, and asked her son to be the ring bearer, and thought maybe she would be understanding of our choice. She wasn't.

SIL and MIL sent us nasty text messages for months about SIL not being included in the wedding party. Extremely passive aggressive and sometimes just purely aggressive. I had to have a major surgery two months after we broke the news about the bridal party, and was receiving texts from them days after my surgery how disappointing it was I didn't get SIL a Christmas gift and that we were tearing the family apart for not attending Thanksgiving (I was in the emergency room). My husband and I kept responding to the messages trying to defend our actions of why we didn't include her (bridal party mostly consisted of close friends that we've known our entire lives, besides our two brothers) and how it was nothing against her. I was finally given a book about narcissism and realized that this is the problem. The MIL enables the SIL and the SIL is a raging narcissist. Back when the other sibling was getting married, SIL love bombed my husband and I with gifts and kind messages and tried to turn us against them before their wedding. Looking back, I never realized how poorly she would talk about others, including those she claims to love. I was also significantly younger and did not realize we were being manipulated.

Our situation is complicated because my husband's parents bought a second house that the SIL has been living in for 4 years (rent free 🙄). So, everyone is expected to gather at the ""family"" (SIL) house. Fast forward, now my husband and I have been ignored at any family functions we attend there or whatever she is around. And we have tried to say hello and thank her for having us. It is like we do not exist. So after a few months of this, I personally decided that I would no longer attend any functions at her house or when she is around and my husband made the choice to only attend when necessary. Unfortunately, because of the control of the MIL, there was no way to uninvite SIL to our wedding and my bridal shower. I stopped responding to any texts and refused to feed into her behavior.

My SIL showed up to my bridal shower wearing white, of course. And when I greeted her, she acted like I wasn't there. She sat on her phone while we opened gifts together and I could hear her complaints from her table all the way across the room. Her and several of her other family members left the shower early, and what really bothered me was finding out that they did a huge cookout at her house during my shower (MIL surprisingly didn't leave). It's complicated because I wouldn't have attended, but it felt like an attempt to hurt us. 

At the wedding this past weekend, SIL showed up to our rehearsal dinner and again, did not acknowledge us. She held her son the entire time and my husband kept trying to help him rehearse his walk down the aisle with the rings, and SIL refused to allow him to practice. She showed up to the wedding dressed very nicely (not in white this time!) but it was clear she was attempting to look her best. Since she wouldn't allow her son to practice, she got to walk him up and down the aisle just like she intentionally planned. (Her wedding was planned in 3 months and quickly, so she did not get her dream wedding). From the past wedding, it was clear the MIL/SIL were using the professional photos WITHOUT pictures of the other SIL in them as family photos, so my husband, photographers, and I decided I would be in most of the photos with their family and his in some of mine. After the ceremony, SIL made a snide remark to one of our photographers to make sure they get a family photo without me in it and they did not. She then walked away while I was starting to take photos with my bridal party after the family photo, and said to her son, ""Let's get out of the picture since I'm not in it.""

MIL had also asked SIL to bring her drip coffee pot for all of the guests since our caterer's coffee was expensive. I trusted that maybe everything would be okay and that coffee wasn't a big deal. I was informed the day after the wedding from MIL that there were two coffee pots that SIL had, one was broken and the other fine. SIL was told not to bring the broke one - she did, and it exploded everywhere during dinner and coffee got absolutely everywhere (it was too busy for me to even notice as the coffee table was in a different room). I heard from guests that witnessed MIL flipped out on SIL for intentionally doing this to sabotage us. But of course, MIL won't do anything else about it since SIL has to always get her way.

I guess this is where I'm at with it. I'm in therapy and have acknowledged that there is no changing this. Narcissists try to twist the situation and will try to make us look bad for not asking her to be in the wedding party, even though she is the one subjecting us to the verbal abuse and now the silent treatment. As the MIL said to us months ago... ""You saw what happened to _____ during their wedding."" In their eyes, my husband and I are in the wrong. I have never disrespected their family, even during all of the initial drama, and tried several times to sit down with MIL and SIL to communicate in person to talk about our feelings and settle this. It never happened. My husband is too afraid to speak his mind. We had an absolutely amazing wedding day, so I'm trying not to think about anything that went wrong, but it's not fair that someone gets to act this way and not be told about it. It's so incredibly frustrating and isolating. But I know that nothing will ever change her behavior, and she will never apologize. There is more to it than this, this is the brief version. 😂 Curious if anyone's gone through something similar?",1,1728520641.0,inlaws,0,1.0,False

1g06j5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g06j5r/my_favorite_studentpart_1/,My favorite student-part 1,"I love being a teacher. Waking up every morning and seeing all my students is the highlight of my days. Each student is very different from one another. I'm not going to lie, there are certain students I do favor over the others. I have one student with whom I bond the most. She always arrives to class on time and is in very put together outfits. She doesn't wear baggy hoodies and pajamas like the other kids. She always says thank you and tells me to have a good day at the end of each class. Heather is just a role model student. Every teacher wishes for students like her. 

Today I went to the teacher's lounge like every other day to eat lunch. I switched who I sat with very frequently because they all tend to get boring fast. Today I sat with Mrs. Crow, a young newer teacher. She began talking to me about how she's engaged and showing me pictures of her fiancé. Oh great, looks like I sat at the wrong table today. 

""Are you seeing anyone,"" she asked 

""Not yet. Still working up the courage to ask her out.""

""You just got to be bold and go for it. Girls like that,"" she says smiling ear to ear with her perfect teeth.

After she let me get a few words she continued talking about herself. As she kept going on about her husband-to-be, I thought about what she had said to me. Maybe I will go for it, it's not like I haven't thought about it before.

After school a few students stayed to make up a quiz. I always bring snacks and drinks for the students, I find it helps them do better. After about 30 minutes, there was only one student left. 

""Are you sure you don't want some soda? It's the last one left."" I asked while reaching for the sprite.

""I guess it won't hurt,"" she responded.

I cracked open the soda and handed it to her while she continued working.

""Already im all done. Do you happen to have last week's test? I was absent yesterday.""

""Ah yes"". I said while rummaging through my drawers.

""It looks like I left them in my car. I could give it to  you if you dont mind walking there with me?""

""Sure. I've got nowhere else to be."" She exclaimed

We step out the classroom and start heading out the side door. 

We finally reach my car and I unlock the door. I open the door and accidentally drop my keys.

""They're right on the seat If you want to start looking for yours,"" I stated while bending down to grab the keys.

As she reaches into the car I push her as hard as I can. Her backpack flips over her head as she falls into the car. Fuck. Am I really doing this right now? At school? The pill I put in her soda should be kicking in any moment now. I slammed the door and drove away as quickly as possible. She started to yell and bang on the windows. Thank god for my tinted windows. She started reaching up towards me and covering my eyes. I grabbed my coffee mug and hit her in the head. I didn't want to hurt her, but she left me no choice. After about 10 minuted of me fighting with her while trying to drive at the same time, she finally collapsed onto the side.

I pull into my garage and think about how to get her inside. I guess I could just carry her. She's small, right? I step inside to make sure there's no one home.

""Hello?"" I asked

""Hey, how was work?"", my sister asked

""Really good,"" I responded not trying to show my panic.

""Ive just got a lot of work to do. I'll be downstairs.""

I grab Heather and slowly carry her through the garage door and down the basement stairs. Thank goodness the door leads straight to the stairs, otherwise, I dont know what I do. My sister never comes down here because this is technically my part of the house. I pay for the basement, and she knows I don't like when people mess with my stuff. I always lock the door and she just never bothers me. It's kindle an unspoken agreement we have. 

I gently place Heather on the floor. She's so pretty when she's sleeping. I go into my workshop and grab a chain and lock I'd been saving. I don't want to do this Heather, but I have to, at least until I can explain. I sit on the couch and dose off.

I finally wake up and look over to the floor, she's still lying there. I check my phone and it's been almost an hour.  When will she wake up? She's been passed out for over two hours now. I didn't think it’d last this long. I'm excited. This is something I've dreamed about doing for a while now. The basement of my house isn’t very nice, but I hope she won't mind. I have a special surprise for her. There's one other room down here and I've spent almost a whole month getting it ready. I tore out the wooden panel walls and painted them pink. All girls like pink. I hope she likes it. I remember this one shirt that Heather would wear often. It was skin-tight with a little bunny on the right side. Sometimes when she’d stretch in class her shirt would roll up and I could see her belly piercing poking out. I bought her a bunny stuffed animal because of this shirt. I hope she likes that too. I lay on the couch impatiently, thinking about how excited she's gonna be for my surprise. As I'm laying there I hear a quiet sound. “Hello”. This didn't sound like Heather. Heather had a loud strong voice. My heart started to beat uncontrollably fast. What should I say? Do I sit up? Do I go up to her? I started to panic. I have to respond soon. I got up and stood behind the couch. I wanted to go to her. Tell her everythings gonna be okay. Once she sees her surprise I know she's going to be thankful. “Did you just wake up here too?” That's what came out of my mouth. What am I doing? Why did I say that? She responded very quickly asking where we were. I didn't know what to tell her. Her new home?

1g06h7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Renters/comments/1g06h7g/advice_upstairs_neighbors_dog_pee/,ADVICE: Upstairs Neighbors Dog Pee,"Hi Renters! Looking for advice. My boyfriend and I rent a unit at a greystar apartment complex in Northern California. This is a pet friendly complex which made me hesitant to move in because of potential barking. The lady who gave me the tour assured that isn't a common complaint they get. So we went ahead and moved in May of this year. Shortly after moving in, we realized our neighbor had a dog.

We soon realized this neighbor never leaves her house, like actually. We have never seen her leave. She has family come visit and bring her groceries once a week? Anyways since she is NOT taking her dog out to the bathroom, the dog uses her porch as the bathroom (poor doggy). Well guess what? The pee comes directly onto our porch. It wasn't a lot the first the time, but I addressed this to her directly by going upstairs, where she barely would open the door to talk to us. I told her i didn't want to have to get management involved since we were new neighbors. She said she was sorry and would take care of it.

Come July, the pee is still happening and on top of that our apartment flooded. When we called maintenance they came to check it out and we found the path was coming from upstairs. She told him something was wrong with her garbage disposal that day but she thought she fixed it. Whatever happened, it ended up flooding our living room and kitchen. We actually had our mattress in the living room at the time bc we only have AC in the living room, so we had to get a new mattress out of our own pockets/insurance. She never apologized and management never came to inspect more of the damage like mold??? ya know? Anyways, management said they were going to take care of the dog pee issue.

Well here we are today. It's been super hot and we haven't been utilizing our porch much. Today was cooler and I had the day off and was going to drink my coffee on the porch. To find out, the porch REEKS of pee, our cushions on the chair are beyond repair. It's all over the floor, the wood is destroyed.

I sent a lengthy email about my grievances, I outlined the Lease Agreement regarding dog pee and mold potential. How it's considered a Biohazard per the CDC, quoted my county code of ordinance on animal urine. Even went through the California Tenant's rights manual I found on the California court's website and pulled rules from there. I told them that we are open to moving to a different unit, but this needs to be fixed immediately or we will alert public health or seek legal recourse (if we have any rights).

They replied that they want to come clean up the pee on our porch and check the walls for mold from the flood, and that they have taken action against the neighbor but cannot tell me for my own protection.

What does that mean? And if this isn't resolved, does anybody know what I can do from here? We are 5 months into a year lease. Please send some advice our way. If you ready all of this too THANK YOU! It's lengthy, needed to vent.

This was my lovely surprise this morning:

1g06ejo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECEProfessionals/comments/1g06ejo/teacher_gifts_megathread/,Teacher Gifts Megathread,"Hi parent participants- we love that you're thinking about how to acknowledge your child's ECE teachers!

However, it's barely October and we're already getting lots of questions about teacher gifts. As we approach the winter holidays, we want to avoid being overrun with people asking the same question every day.

From now until January- **any further parent posts asking for gift ideas will be removed. If you have a specific question about your centre/teachers/local traditions etc... Ask it here.**

For parent questions in general- use the [search function](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECEProfessionals/search/?q=gift&type=link&cId=7c8a9efe-cf0a-4531-aa49-e33665086e59&iId=6bdf7b6e-57c9-4511-938e-31801b67383d) first, and please ensure your post is flaired as a parent post to enable teachers to engage according to their capacity, especially over the busy, stressful holiday season!

Here are some gift ideas to get you started.

1. Handwritten Thank You Note: A heartfelt note expressing your gratitude for their hard work and dedication is the most meaningful gifts. You don't need to spend anything to show appreciation.
2. Gift Cards: Coffee shop, bookstore, or general-purpose gift cards to give them a break or the opportunity to purchase something they like.
3. Personalized Classroom Supplies: Personalized stationery or classroom supplies with the teacher's name or a special message
4. Indoor Plants: A low-maintenance indoor plant or succulent to brighten up their workspace.
5. Gourmet Treats: A basket of gourmet chocolates, snacks, or a selection of teas and coffees to share amongst the team.
6. Inspirational Book: A book that provides inspiration, motivation, or insight into teaching and childcare.



Things to consider before buying:

1. **School or Organizational Policies**: Check if the centre has any policies regarding gift-giving to teachers. Many people in this sub suggest cash- which would not be allowed in my country- so check what is suitable or share your location-specific questions below and hopefully a local teacher can answer.
2. **Inclusivity**: Ensure that the gift acknowledges not just the teacher but also considers all the staff involved. This might include teaching assistants, support staff, and administrators.
3. **Teacher's Interests**: Try to choose a gift that reflects the teacher's interests or hobbies. This personal touch can make the gift more meaningful.
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Consider cultural and religious sensitivities. Ensure that the gift is appropriate for the teacher's background and beliefs.
5. **Allergies and Dietary Restrictions**: If you're considering food as a gift, be aware of any allergies or dietary restrictions the teacher might have.
6. **Collective Gifts**: Consider organizing a collective gift from all parents to ensure inclusivity and to contribute to a more significant gift if the budget allows.
7. **Non-Monetary Gestures**: Sometimes, a non-monetary gesture like volunteering in the classroom, helping with class activities, or offering to run errands can be equally appreciated. Please don't put financial stress on your family to keep up. If buying a gift will put strain- no need. A thank you note is free, and just as meaningful.
8. **Ask for Suggestions**: If you're unsure, don't hesitate to ask the teacher or their colleagues for gift suggestions. They might provide valuable insights.
9. **Avoid Personal Items**: Be cautious when considering personal items like clothing or fragrances, as these can be subjective and might not suit the teacher's taste.
10. **Consider Sustainability**: If the teacher is passionate about sustainability, choose gifts that align with their values, such as eco-friendly or reusable items.
11. **Respect Privacy**: Respect the teacher's privacy and boundaries. Avoid overly personal or intrusive gifts.

[Cisco has a way of getting my attention. ](https://preview.redd.it/ieaotgjvottd1.png?width=1016&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d5530dd9a085d19e8854d87aa8a1d50bf7213c7)

I awoke to the smell of fresh cut grass and a cool breeze on my face. Cool enough to prompt me to pull the blanket over my shoulders and snuggle in deeper. This was the first day of our fall vacation. Mornings were becoming cooler, so Randy and I were headed to warmer weather. With a groggy mind, I didn’t think about where I was, but I knew nobody expected anything and no appointments forced me from bed.

A whine alerted my senses the Cisco our Yorkshire Terrier had seen me adjust my body; he was awake. I laid perfectly still hoping he would be content for a while longer so I could revel in my morning larceny, those final stolen moments of rest before I admit that I must get up. Then another whine. I opened one eye, only one in hope he would not notice. He stood inches from my face with his squeaky toy in his mouth, a green, rubber pig with multicolored poke-a-dots.Reality kicked in. If I was to successfully pilfer more shut-eye, I would have to outmaneuver this witty adversary. Nonchalantly, I rolled to cradle my pillow and assume a sleeping pose. Again, a whine, but this time I realized the sound did not come from Cisco but the toy. Oh no, once he got started, there was no end. Something dropped on my arm and a paw scratched my sheets.

I could ignore this disruption. More scratching. His determination was stronger than my attempt to cold shoulder his request, so I picked up the pig causing it to squeak loudly with the slightest touch. The game was on and continued for about 10 minutes. Truely, not the worst way to wake up.

The breeze and the sound of voices outside my window drew my attention. Who was in my backyard? With a glance, I remembered, our motorhome was parked at the Schneider’s Bluff Golf Course in Utah. Using our [Harvest Host Membership](https://www.harvesthosts.com/) we had parked here yesterday, eaten dinner and spent the night. Those voices belonged to the ground maintenance crew. A lawnmower drove past. Now, I was truly awake.

Having unpacked some chairs and prepared the coffee the night before, I gave into Cisco’s request to go outside. He no longer scratched the sheets to play but now scratched the door; he had to pee. With my coffee in hand, we entered paradise. Cisco found an area to empty his bladder, I sat in the chair and watched the sunrise. For anyone who hasn’t experience this time of day on a golf course, you are missing out. The few workers scattered to their duties, leaving alone with nature.

Golf greens are manicured lawns, dotted with a variety of trees. Because of the season, these burgeoned with multi-colored leaves: browns, oranges, burgundy and shades of nature. In front of and flowing around edges of the club house bloomed several varieties of mums, sunflowers, and purple sage. Off in the distance water fell over large boulders layered to create a beautiful centerpiece. The water gathered into a shallow pool and then flowed lazily around a curve and out of view.

I looked down at Cisco who had taken up residency on my lap without me noticing. Once I was awake and he had explored the immediate went back to sleep. I was up now for the day. My hands smoothed a tuft of hair and rubbed his ears. He burrowed into the crevices of my lap.

I thought of the oyster that grows a pearl from a small piece of sand reminded me great things come from small annoyances.

1g06dnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/1g06dnk/alert_for_a_long_text_dont_read_if_it_bothers_you/,"📌Alert for a long text! Don't read if it bothers you, of course.(My therapist asked me to tell the story I used the same text) I have several doubts about my ex-boyfriend's manners. By demanding responsibilities from him, could I have triggered narcissistic behaviour? ","My boyfriend (he is on autistic spectrum, maybe this information can be relevant here) seemed an introvert when I met him so I took the initiative of contacting also kissing on our first date, after a few weeks talking, which he later told me he took as a red flag; he told me that for him, things worked by going out for *""a coffee, then another coffee, and another coffee, and then...""*  He didn't finish the sentence, but it made me thoughtful because he had told me that in our previous conversation he had only been with only one person before me, (in terms of kissing or having sex) according to him. But that day we repeated many times and after we left each other to go home, we kept talking and he told me it was nice and enjoyable;
On our second date, he said he already felt like he was in a relationship. Caveat: We were both equally open to it. The enthusiasm in the conversations was mutual, as it was for the schedules initially. But soon after, some arguments arose when I started to question him after observing some behaviours such as omissions, inconsistencies and a few lies. I think the justification for that may go beyond insecurity. Eg.: telling me he needed to go out to buy something when he was actually going out for a coffee with a friend.  At first, that was somewhat understandable, but as time goes on, it's natural we get more confident and leave the excuses. But it wasn't what happened in so many cases.
So I observed behaviours like that and would point them out to him with the intention of helping him understand that he could be transparent with me about what he wanted/needed, and that I would understand him.
And I kept realising that, and trying to do the same, so I was getting frustrated but I was trying to show him the best way would be to communicate better, and I asked for that several times. We just started having arguments. 
Then he would stop responding to my messages or would reply with gaps of several hours, which was not usual, however I assumed it was a little because of his autism (I mean the fact he chose to be quiet and refusing any type of communication, I got it as a difficulty to face the conflicts in order to solve them as I read). On the other hand, it seemed like an attempt at emotional manipulation. I started feeling like he was trying to manipulate me over time with silent treatments, in order to condition me to accept that kind of behavior. He said he distanced himself because I was being accusatory, but he refused to have any clarifying things properly, giving  short and evasive answers only, followed by silence and later saying he didn’t want to talk about that matter. Eventually, he refused to discuss anything related to us, claiming that I only talked about that, but that's not true, because we connected in the first place with common interests. I was insisting on clarification because it was bothering me, obviously.

I wrote to him several times in an attempt to resolve that because he refused to call or talk personally claiming to feel uncomfortable. 
He started saying I was just  interested in emotional drama and that I was being abusive, which sounds like gaslighting to me.
In order to break that loop, I invited him to reflect and ask himself why things were happening that way. And after some other unpleasant events, I suggested we go to therapy with the same professional. At one point, he briefly said he would think about it, but later replied that he didn’t want to.

Let's go back in time for a while: Knowing he had previously used dating apps, one day I asked if he still used them. Not only did he tell me he wasn't using that, but he also made a gesture of handing me his phone as proof that there was nothing there. That alerted me because it doesn't take much intelligence to know that doesn’t serve as proof. A few days later, I asked again, and then he told me that after one of our early arguments, he stopped believing our relationship would work and simply went back to using dating apps. So yes! He had underestimated my intelligence by handing me the phone then. 

Similar things happened regarding conversations with ""other people,"" and what seemed to me like simple things that could be resolved through dialogue became triggers for avoidance. He told me that when ""I started being like that,"" his mind started to go in other directions. I also heard something like ""I did things that must have discouraged you, and you didn’t leave."" Would that be an implicit hint? Why didn't he tell me what he wanted then? What do my readers understand as ""other directions""? HOWEVER...  I asked a few times if he wanted to continue meeting/getting involved with other  people because he conveyed this in previous conversations about people 
he was talking to when we met and his answer was: ""Sigh"", ""I'm not doing this conversation anymore, let's talk about music"", or simply nothing. So he never gave me the confidence that he had stopped talking to ppl who he used to flirt with. He even said he was still having some conversations with one of them  at some point (by the way, the one he had shown attraction for, and according to him, it wouldn’t work out because he had a “sexual hobby” that didn’t work for him, but he continued talking to her because he wanted to understand what she wanted from him. That was also during our relationship) I naturally asked questions about his feelings/ intentions towards that person (She lives at the same country he was going to live for a couple of months for some specific reason, well.... It's natural since he told me he started talking to them during the days we were in bad vibes. So he said I was jealous and he simply adopted an: ""I'm not talking to anyone,"" as a standard response for anything that referred to a similar subject.

*Just one more topic about ""I'm not talking to anyone"" Once, during one of our conversations when he was in a good mood, he mentioned that he basically only talked to family members and three friends, and months before he had said he had two or three female friends who lived in the UK / Corea and it was very rare for him to talk to them. I felt that his tone was defensive, which conveyed more insecurities. I don’t want to sound like a judgmental fool, but I will point out a few things and leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions. The person had 'theoretically' stopped using dating apps after having used them for several years. He considers himself a nerd, and much of his life is online, with several social media accounts. It’s a bit strange to say he limits himself so much in chats. I asked a few questions trying not to sound invasive, but that’s the response I got. And then: I saw a few conversations, when he opened his Instagram one of them with a girl (from USA) btw and reactions with ""♥️"" although the subjects at least at that moment, the topics were generic. Discouraged, I just said in a sarcastic tune: *""Anyone is too little!""* He called me jealous, claiming they were just friends.. Actually the conversations were about general stuff. I don't believe that girl would even be interested in him in a romantic way (for reasons that I won't elaborate on further) but the conversation seemed very ""enthusiastic"". Before ppl ask me how I could see that and call me invasive.... I asked him for that and he showed me. 
And he told me: she’s my friend. (Wtf?) Further down, there were 3 or 4 more chats with girls, and I asked about the one closest to the bottom (he had done the same thing with me before when he saw my chat open, and I responded without any issues. The difference is that I never said I didn’t talk to anyone; on the contrary, I even mentioned a male friendship I made through a dating app in the past).

At the bottom was a conversation with one of his former students. Hey, it’s fine to have friendships with the opposite sex, but when you start hiding it... Bro? Why the insecurity at this level? Could they have been the targets of some previous flirting? (Maybe not just 'previous' 🤔)""
But my point wasn’t about the people or the conversations with them because of jealousy simply. Actually it was more related to the fact that he was always on the defensive, giving evasive answers and inconsistent justifications in various aspects of our conversations about topics like that. He used to say he basically was talking to five other people. 

I just asked him things like that because of the other manners, I already started to think that he was maintaining the relationship with me because it was 'real' at the moment, but he wanted to keep the possibility of something better or simply 'something' in case things didn’t work out between us. The traditional game of those who embrace the idea of fluid relationships. 
Could this behavior be partly related to the difficulty of resolving conflicts? That's it: instead of having a conversation with me about what was bothering him and what was bothering me, he simply tried to sweep it under the rug and avoid me. I struggled to believe that someone I admired precisely for showing me that they were above various types of behavioral neglect was choosing that path.
 I was kind of waiting for the person to face the reality because some behaviours seemed childish and therefore incompatible with the part of his personality that made me get interested. He used to present good arguments and articulated consistently on the general topics we discussed, which made our connection enjoyable initially.
 We enjoyed a good moment together of course.
Things heated up between us, like with any couple. The difference was that, by his choice, we didn’t have privacy, and he only agreed to go out in public places. That was okay for me, but after a few months, I suggested doing something different, like going camping or going somewhere that would allow us more privacy. This wasn’t necessarily for having sex, but we always went to pubs, for a walk in town, or to parks, which, although still public places, allowed us a few minutes of 'peace.'

We  had sex only once, for literally 3 seconds, and it caused him extreme concern about the condition of the condom (which was intact and fine) and a huge paranoia about all the negative possibilities.
We did that in a place without total privacy, and he was so worried while I was trying to calm down he disclaimed about the spot - a park -  but that was the only option we could think about. (📌 On that day, we had gone to that place somewhat prepared for it, and he even made some funny comments about it. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I was okay about it.)

After that, he told me he wouldn't be prepared to do that again anytime soon, I said ok but I didn't understand such a big block around it since he told me I used to make him uncontrollably horny and sex would be something dangerous. 
Days later he said something like ""I want you"", ""let's do whatever you want"", "" let's have sex"". He had a few beers that day and the next day he sounded like his changed his mind a little and in some time later he sent me a 15-min You-Tube video containing some basic principles of Geomancy. He told me he had asked some questions during that practice about whether he should have sex with me or not. He was looking for answers regarding a decision about a trip he was going to take related to professional matters.

I was willing to have patience with almost everything that would be different for me, but no cheating. I basically found myself wrestling with someone else's partially fictional universe.

He said emphatically: ""You ruined everything"" was his sentence when he saw me struggling against an end in that condition, bc letting a lack of communication create a society of monsters to destroy expectations and good feelings becomes sad, poor, even ridiculous. That's my ""doubt"" (if I really can call it doubt) because that represents a weak manipulation tactic usually used by neurotypicals lacking emotional intelligence or / and respect, but technically that doesn’t match him because he usually analyzes facts and situations more intelligently, in a high level common sense, I would say. At the same time I’m talking about a person who *literally* ran away a few times when I sought him out to have a conversation. 

Later, he started engaging in apparent narcissistic games, like singing while I was talking to him (I understand he was anxious about making a difficult decision for him in those days, but…) He complained that I only wanted to talk about relationship issues while he preferred to talk about movies or music, which sounded a bit bizarre to me; I wasn’t talking about problems because I enjoyed it but because I found it necessary to  clarify what was bothering me. And he seemed to start hating me and for a while I felt the same.

There were times when I went to see him (without us schedule it and I know that's not the best thing to do but he just stopped talking once again, I was sad, because I know there's a lot of better ways to solve that. I just wanted to have a decent conversation. Although I understood he got nervous and anxious with our issues.
One day I approached him saying, ""Hi, I'd like to talk.

 I know you're uncomfortable, but can we at least have a brief conversation?"" He seemed to hate me at that moment, but I insisted, telling him how disproportionate it was imo. He certainly interpreted many things from my side in a way that I didn't intend. He even said a few times he was paranoid; 
Naturally, people ask why I stayed. I wish I could have done something to change that *because/however/although* I can't see a logical reason for that set of strange manners. I got irritated in the process, and I made mistakes in how I treated him too, but nothing unforgivable to the point where I didn’t get any response, even if neutral.
So he told me that if I didn't leave, he would notify the police. I laughed ironically, but in a state of perplexity. Really? Something we could clear up over coffee, talking like the 30+ year-old adults we are. He started laughing in a strange way—nervous, sarcastic—and turned the corner. I asked where he was going, and he answered, ""To the police station."" I said, ""Really? I’ll go with you, and we can clarify the exact reasons driving you to do this, right?""
I couldn’t understand what led him to this extreme but wouldn’t allow him to have a conversation with me as the situation required. There were no screams, no violence, no offense or anything that would make the involvement of a police officer necessary imo. 

He claimed that I was ""following"" him. It was: I went to meet him on the same path we used to take when he was coming back from work. It was our way to the train station. We had an arrangement, and apparently, he wasn’t keeping it. I believe I had the right to understand what was going on. Simply blaming me, saying I was ruining the relationship, was neither fair nor sensible. I had some indications that he was seeing other women.
I never made any comment that would make him think it was a criterion for me that a man should only have had one woman /s or that he couldn't go out with a friend, or that someone couldn't have had a past or other loves. 

He also told me he felt threatened by the tone I used when I let him know I found out where he lives. 📌There we go: : we don’t live far from each other, there’s just one neighborhood separating ours, and a friend recognized him because he had seen us together and asked if I knew, and I responded that I only knew the general area. My friend was even a bit surprised because most people in relationships usually visit each other’s homes. But in our case, he would feel awkward about his parents and there are other implicit factors, like him having thought I might have some material interest, a different nationality, given that he also made it clear he held some prejudice toward people of my nationality (yeah... I know). This would be another barrier for certain things. I know that the way he processes some thoughts is very different from mine, and I let a lot of things slide because I believed time would help him feel more at ease with me. But his behavior went from 100 to 0 in some aspects towards me. The conversations got a strange tune, he started frequently giving up on our schedule; apparently, the inconsistencies about trivial day-to-day things were increasing in proportion.
There was a moment when we reconciled, and we exchanged an ""I love you,"" which once again came from me, but he reciprocated. Also, one day, when I suggested I might leave the country, he said he felt wrecked, empty... 
My understanding of that guy's motives fluctuates as much as his emotions and feelings, I think. In part, he was afraid of being left, so he preferred to do it first, as he did but in the process, he decided to inflate his ego by showing narcissistic traits. Did he use the fact that I chose to stay and try to fix things as a means to inflate his ego, seeing the opportunity to cheat?
He justifies the feelings I had for him by saying that this was the result of magic spells he did before we met. 
I've already put myself in his shoes several times, but I don’t know if he has the same ability. 
I was disappointed and perplexed by his reaction to my attempt to talk + he had said that his friends advised him to stay away from me. Did his account contain valid justifications for my dissatisfaction? I don't think so
So I wrote a text similar to this one for his friend, slightly shorter than this, telling what would be 'my version' of the events. And probably now he hates me because of that. 
Any comments on the subject are welcome, except about the length of the text, as I'm aware that it’s worthy of a magazine article, lol

⬇️Phrases he told me more than once that, in my opinion, convey superficiality/immaturity and don't align with his manners:
1. ""You are attractive, who would leave you?""
2. ""You are attractive, no one would cheat on you.""
3. ""I never cheated.""

It all feels like** ***your*** **choice, right? But what if I told you that every decision you’ve made—whether to drink that coffee or even to get out of bed—wasn’t really yours to make at all?**

**Let me explain.**

For centuries, philosophers have debated the idea of *free will*—the notion that we control our actions, our lives, our future. On the flip side is *determinism*, the belief that everything is predestined by previous causes—like dominoes falling one after another. But today, modern science is really starting to shake things up in this debate.

Take neuroscience, for example. Researchers have discovered that your brain makes decisions before *you* even realize it. Some studies show that certain brain activity can predict a decision *seconds* before we consciously make it. Imagine that: before you think, “I’m going to pick up this coffee mug,” your brain has already fired off the neurons that set that action into motion. So, are you really in control?

And it doesn’t stop there. Psychology points to patterns in human behavior that can make us seem more like predictable machines than free-thinking individuals. From childhood traumas shaping adult decisions to how our environment nudges us toward certain behaviors, our “choices” often feel less like a product of free will and more like the outcome of external and internal forces that we don’t fully understand or control.

So where does that leave us? Are we just passengers on a ride, thinking we have the wheel? Or do we still have some form of autonomy?

I’m curious—have you ever had a moment where you *felt* like your decision wasn’t entirely yours? Maybe a gut feeling pushed you toward something, or it felt like the universe (or your brain!) had already made up its mind for you. Did that make you question how much control you really have over your life?

It’s a tough one. It messes with your head a bit, but it’s a fascinating thought to sit with.",1,1728519023.0,themindmatrix,0,1.0,False

1g062q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/LARP/comments/1g062q9/in_us_vassal_larp_review/,"[IN, US] Vassal LARP Review","“Kurzenstrad is grateful to your father for his service -”
“My father gave his life, his lands, and the love of his family for your war!” Magdalin spat at Lord Dimitri, cutting him off. “What has that left me?”

I attended the fifth installment, entitled Whisper of Shadows, of Vassal LARP, an historically-based high-immersion LARP - and not to sound too mushy and starry-eyed, but it's the LARP I’ve been searching for, for years. 

“Vassal is a live action roleplaying game set in a fictitious setting called “The Known World” which strongly resembles Europe and Asia during the late 14th, 15th, and early 16th centuries. It is a game of people, be they monarchs, knights, merchants, or farmers, and their lives, hopes, and struggles.” (vassallarp.com, Player’s Handbook). It is held twice per year - one installment in spring and another in autumn, over the course of a long weekend (Thursday - Sunday).

I originally heard about Vassal from a couple of friends who attended. I was intrigued, but life and scheduling got in the way of making it to an event, until Whisper of Shadows came along and I committed to the bit. Vassal requires character approval before signing up for an event, both the submission of a character bio and garb photos. Character building is right up my alley, and I immediately set to researching the regions of The Known World and figuring out where the garb I already owned would fit historically. 

There are twelve regions from which to choose, from Albionne and Saragon in the west to Iskara and The Steppes in the east. I settled on Kurzenstrad - a region based on mid 14th - late 15th century Germanic Holy Roman Empire, Western Europe. Vassal maintains a Lore Guidebook, with nearly 100 pages of the lore leading up to Whisper of Shadows. This is a game with a backstory! I wanted a character with room to grow, a relative unknown with high ambitions who could rise to success or fall to failure depending on the story. After much character deliberation, Magdalin Wagner was born. 

Magdalin is the daughter of a lumber baron, who spent her early childhood cocooned from the world’s darkness by the wealth of her father. That soon changed when war came to her doorstep - her father’s estate lay at a river ford in the north of Kurzenstrad, the perfect crossing for overland troops. Magdalin’s father strongly supported the claim to Kurzenstrad’s rule of Lord Dimitri Maritz, and the estate’s wealth of coin, lumber, and lodging was offered without restraint to the war efforts. This made for an adolescence marred with tragedy and difficulty, and Magdalin came into adulthood as a woman who was no stranger to the hard work of running an estate with no servants to speak of, but with plenty of dead and dying soldiers to tend to. After Magdalin’s father died, what was left of the estate passed to her eldest brother, and Magdalin was alone in the world.

And thus the link to the story of Whisper of Shadows. Set in the region of Obrovoska, in a tiny town called Tarvik with an inexplicably wealthy tavern reportedly attended by the highest of society, to which Magdalin made the journey to find her fortune. The story that played out over the weekend was one of mystery, intrigue, battles, curses, murder, and shovels!

I arrived on Thursday afternoon, Day Zero. The location had the option of bunk or tent camping, and I chose to bunk. The lodge is climate controlled, and in addition to two bunk rooms includes bathrooms with showers, a full kitchen with all cooking and dining implements included, a large gathering area with a fireplace, and down a small hill, an outdoor pavilion. I loaded in my own bags and assisted with setup. I had never met anyone involved in Vassal in any meaningful way, and everyone was immediately warm and welcoming - a huge help for the anxiety I was feeling!

Midway through setup, most people changed into garb, myself included. Official game start was not until Friday at noon, but this out of game/in garb time allowed me to get familiarized and comfortable with the location and to start stepping into Magdalin’s shoes. Once setup was completed, everyone who was onsite gathered at the pavilion, which had been transformed into a medieval tavern with canvas walls, lanterns and candles for light, and all the little details and accouterments that add an extra level of immersion to the space. The evening was spent enjoying wine and charcuterie, listening to music performed by players, and getting to know everyone. I thought Thursday night was lovely, but I had no idea what else was in store!

Friday morning was go time - coffee and garb, last minute player arrivals and setup, and a lesson from leadership on consent, storytelling, and combat. Vassal is a consent-based LARP, and “the most important rule is referred to as “the Spirit of the Game,” or more commonly, Rule Zero. Rule Zero is a mentality that puts focus on a fun, safe and fulfilling experience as the highest priority, that is collectively shared and nurtured by the community. It is never the intent for any individual or group to “win the game.” The core of Vassal’s existence is the respect for Rule Zero and that all players participate in a way which upholds that vision.” (vassallarp.com, Player’s Handbook) 

Consent and comfort levels are communicated by a small series of hand signals which allow players to voice concern, respond to a check-in, clarify confusion, etc. without breaking the immersion of a scene. The hand signals have a corresponding color which may be voiced aloud if a hand signal is not viable for any reason. If a player finds themselves to be overwhelmed, overstimulated, or just needs a break, a decompression room is available and stocked with water and snacks. Vassal leadership stressed the importance of consent and playing to lift, and I did not see a single instance of anyone breaking Rule Zero the entire weekend, which speaks volumes about the type of culture that has been cultivated here!

When game on was called, the story swept into action immediately. Vassal is not a large game - there were less than 40 people in attendance - but the intimacy of such a small group allowed the intrigue to flourish. Storylines from previous games tied into the main quest of Whisper of Shadows, and while it took me a moment to find my footing within the story, I was quickly pulled into the mystery of a cursed book, a potential murder, and the questionable past of the town of Tarvik.

The game runners did a masterful job of creating props to further the story. The cursed book, the skeletal hand, the clues hidden in the barkeep’s effects and the missing tavern owner’s records, the postings on the quest board - all paper items were convincingly aged, old blood splatters eerily splashed across the pages of the cursed book, ledgers realistically completed. The game runners were playing characters within the story as well, and did an excellent job of guiding the story from within their characters.

The events over Friday and Saturday were a whirlwind. I was caught up in court intrigue, and Magdalin was officially inducted into the court of a textile magnate Duchess by Saturday night. A pitched battle took place Saturday afternoon, with the Obrovoskans and their allies attempting to fend off the Khan of the Steppes and her invading forces. The Khan reigned victorious on the field, and was presented with a drinking vessel made from the skull of an unwise Obrovoskan noble in congratulations. The evenings were spent in storyline and song in the tavern and as guests of the Khan in her complex; forging allies, negotiating back room treaties, and trying kumis for the first time. The mystery of the wealth of Tarvik was unraveled, but the consequences of that knowledge remain to be seen, and Nordenmark nearly lost one of their own to madness and shovels in the process. The cursed book remained mostly a mystery - perhaps we will find out at the next installment of the story in the spring!

Vassal is more than the sum of its parts - the people, the story, the characters, and the action all combine into a high-immersion game that allows your character to seek knowledge, or status, or victory in battle, or everything at once. The game is at turns serious, unsettling, convincingly dangerous, and lighthearted, joyous, and fulfilling. 

If you enjoy a game where the lore is deep and believable, the players have crafted complex backstories and garb for their characters, and the storyline is both easy to join and an extensive web of interconnected chronicles, then Vassal is the LARP for you. I can’t wait to return to The Known World in the spring!

Today at Tim Hortons, I ordered two chicken wraps, and the Tims app had a 20% off promotion. I used the app's automatic scan and pay feature. However, after paying, I noticed on the receipt that the staff member had made a mistake and only ordered me one chicken wrap.

Because the discount was involved, things became complicated. I told the person who took my order that they shorted me one wrap; I should have two, and since the two were supposed to include the 20% discount, it was a bit complicated. If they just added one more, I would end up paying more than I should. He didn’t say a word and turned to go into the kitchen to call the manager. The manager came out looking angry and told me that their staff didn’t know about any discounts and that in the future, I should turn off the automatic payment feature. I explained that usually, if I order a few items, that’s what I expect, and staff shouldn’t make mistakes. He was quite rude to me. He went back into the kitchen to sort it out, and eventually gave me the cash difference. After refunding me, there was no apology, no words of comfort—just an air that I was the one at fault. I then left.

Honestly, the price difference was only two or three dollars; I didn’t care about the money. What mattered to me was how they handled the situation when their staff made a mistake. I don’t know what has happened to Canadians. How did we go from a society where we would buy a free coffee for the car behind us to one where, despite a restaurant staff's error, customers are lectured not to use the automatic payment feature that the company itself supports, just to save them trouble? It’s truly disappointing.

I hope this kind of manager is in the minority. I hope that people who feel cold and lack human warmth are not representative of Canadian society.

Mainly mayonnaise and its derivatives, but we also got to make an orange vinaigrette and a classic balsamic vinaigrette! We made a mayonnaise, a thousand island dressing, a tartare sauce, aioli sauce, and we got to make a  vegannaisse as well! (Made that one in the blender thankfully 😅) MY ARM IS SO TIRED 😭, all of them came out lovely though! the emulsion of the sauces was easy after preparing with the cold sauces section of the garde manger book. We used rock salt for our aioli so we had to hydrate the salt crystals by whisking in a bit of water! I felt thankful that I had read up on it and it was a point touched in the garde manger! 
I was kinda fed up with tasting mayo by the end of the class x3, but it was a fun skill to practice in class and i really appreciate that my teammates ask for my opinion on seasonings! We like to taste stuff until we're all happy with it, but i'll usually be the one that is very meticulous with their salt x3, I much prefer to taste salt levels rather than dumping it all in, especially since I'm still not very experienced with using my hands to dose salt :P (mostly use a rock salt grinder at home) it is an essential skill i need to develop though! and im glad im getting experience using it. 

Grabbed a nice iced coffee after class from one of our coffee shops and got home and took a nice nap 😁 Excited because tomorrow we make hot emulsions which includes the famous hollandaise sauce!

He doesn’t do that, so whenever I’m planning to he then tries to make plans with his friends too, but never on his own schedule and pace. 

Today he brought up again that when we were at home together I’m always on my phone. It’s not a new complaint and I really tried to not do that and do more things together while at home, but I’ve noticed that in reality it’s the only time I have some time for myself and I don’t want to give that up. I also feel it’s kinda unfair- today he came home from work at around 9:30 pm, and we decided to stay at home because I was feeling unwell tonight. I told him to go out with his friends but he didn’t want to so he stayed with me. We decided to watch a movie together which lasted 2 hours , and then we were sleepy so we were going to bed. It was a lazy day when he came home, it’s true. But yesterday when he got off from work in the afternoon, we went shopping because he wanted to buy new clothes, we then grabbed a coffee, strolled around the city, and then went to a restaurant. We were out for about 6 hours and I had a really good time. And this happens almost daily, we always go for a walk and most of the times we go out for a drink or dinner. 

I really feel stress in this whole situation and it seems unfair to me that he’s always looking for reasons to say I’m not giving him attention. Looking at the bigger picture, I feel like I don’t have enough time for myself and when I do, I feel guilty subconsciously because of his attitude. How can we balance this out? What can I do to understand him more and for him to understand me better? Any advice is appreciated. 

Tl/dr: I (22F) feel guilty taking personal time away from my bf (27M), and we’re always fighting about similar issues. How to balance it?",1,1728517290.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

He defines our relationship as more than friends, seeing each other exclusively, the honest & purest thing he’s ever had but NOT A RELATIONSHIP! He says he’s never thought about what’s next or if there’s anything next as he’s only been going with the flow. We are not official in any way; we never post about each other on social media, and have very few pics together. I am 30(F) and met him through a messy mutual friend’s setup where his best friend wanted to sleep with me but Joe ended up being with me.

Dynamics of this arrangement: We meet often (indoor + outdoor), spend a night together in a week. When we hang out, we order food, watch movies together, go to cafes, go on motorbike rides, walks, etc. PDA is minimal, He rarely hold hands, but gives me a peck on my cheek sometimes when we’re out, waiting at the signal or coffee shop, etc. He tells me he likes me and that this is the most honest he’s ever been with anyone. Apparently some of his friends know about me, But I never have met any other friends.

My friends know about him, but since he doesn't want to be official, I have not introduced him.

Situation: His birthday is this Friday. I asked him if we can take a trip together and his answer was pretty vague about how he doesn’t like going on trips because he is broke. Then I asked him if we can meet a day prior to his birthday or on the day of his birthday, he said he’s not sure. He did mention that he’d like to meet me before, on the day or next day after the birthday. He said I’ll be home but he’s keen on making plans with his buddies. I am not expecting anything in return; I want him to have a nice time and be happy, is all. He said he’s not in a position to be in a relationship cos of being broke and his career is his priority. I really like this guy and would love to be by his side officially in his bad times where he builds himself up, I’m not a gold digger and he very well knows that.

Yes, after 7 months, I think I am ready to be in a loving relationship. However, from our previous conversations, I feel like he is a person who doesn't believe in making it official ever. He just proudly wears a batch of I went with the flow without thinking about it, and I feel like I can't say anything after that.

He does acknowledge that I spoil him a lot. I give him a lot of small gifts when he doesn't really. Bring him his fav food sometimes - he does that at a times too.

Exclusive but not official: Basically, not calling each other boyfriend-girlfriend (nothing serious-don't label it as a relationship). It means one of us (HE) can walk out any time without any drama/messy breakup and not carrying any feelings. We say I love you to each other a lot.

PART 2 ","Hi!! Last we left off, I had just finished talking about the living room. Now, I'll discuss the dining room and the kitchen!! *\*Read till the end for a surprise!!\**

**The Dining Room**

For the dining room, I got most of my references from season 4 episode 12, ""Who Threw The Barbitals In Mrs. Fletcher's Chowder?"". An episode of all all time. 

[an msw screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/6bwr4gbxqrtd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c740ec44df88f730775bb182fde7b4ab0cedb33)

* Doors and windows: The dining room itself wasn't too tricky, but the FOUR DOORS in this small room certainly gave me pause. Well, four doors and one window. I love the pass through, but BOY did I have trouble finding a good match. 
* Shifting things around: In Jessica's dining room, her display hutch is on the left side of the arch, with the grandfather clock on the other side. But I only had one and a half tiles to work with! One tile hutches did not capture the grandeur of JB's. I ended up putting a larger hutch on the wall where the window was
   * The hutch is from cats & dogs, & I shoved a cc plate holder in the middle for more storage. I think I got the vibe right, even if it's a little wonky.
   * In an ideal world I would have a tablecloth bc Jessica is a PROPER lady, but I didn't have a lot of options for a 6 seater table. 

**The kitchen**

Of all the rooms in Jessica's house, THIS is the one we see the most. I was spoiled for reference images. And I wanted to do it justice, because this is really where Jess spends the most time!!

* Some great references I used!!

* The kitchen was LOADS of fun! Jess's kitchen is full of detail and clutter, and it was super satisfying to hunt for specific items. I think this the room I got closest to the show. I love this whole room. 
* The desk: I am super happy with this desk!! I got a PERFECT match for the brown and white jugs. I made sure to include JB's typewriter (I briefly considered using the word processor she switched to in season 8, but come on. that typewriter is too iconic). On the left side, Jessica has a stack of red-marked graded paper, and a notebook & coffee on the right side. I was also able to find a nice pencil holder. 
   * this is a really small detail, but it bothers me IMMENSLY that you cannot place chairs 90 degrees from each other at larger round tables. 
   * And again, I wish I could've added a tablecloth.  
* The counter & hob: I spent a while wondering why the proportions of the counter looked so weird, until I realized that her oven is actually two tiles! I think I made a decent replica - the left side is from the country kitchen kit, and the right side is two cc ovens smushed together to get the right look. 
   * I am SO pleased with the shelves above the oven, too! Jessica has two shelves full of jars & bottles and such, with hanging copper pots above. I only filled one shelf, because the proportion worked out better that way. Originally, I had a hanging copper pot rack, but because I used medium height ceilings, it was floating way above the shelves. I opted for a base game wall rack instead. I also put a kettle on the back burner, and placed cutting boards + oven mitts on the side. I found a wall mug holder, in place of Jessica's cabinet storage. The far counter has both a tin AND  a breadbox, because I could not find a Tin Breadbox. Also there's a cute little wire spice holder as a nod to her wall spice rack. 
   * Note: Jessica only has one cabinet in her kitchen. Why. I gave her three because it looks better that way, and she deserves extra storage for when she's cooking with Seth!!
* Tall counter: I was so confused by the narrow island at the back of the kitchen. Is it just a shelf? is it a breakfast nook? Who is she? To replicate the ratios, I used counter from the bistro kit, and raised a hallway table from country living for some extra height. The objects on that counter are constantly changing, but I felt obligated to include a little tv & a rotary phone, as they are important props in several episodes! I also placed some books & a vase. There are some tall plants behind the counter. Finally, I gave Jess a bar stool. In some episodes, it doesn't exist, in others, there are two stools, and they side they're on shifts, too! 
   * I had SO MUCH trouble finding a period appropriate phone! Jessica has this super cute mint green rotary phone, but I was only able to find wall phones or 1900's looking rotaries. I went for the older style, because I imagined slamming the phone back to the cradle would be WAY more satisfying. This phone appears in several rooms! It's BoopDoodles ""Vintage set \_ vintage phone."" Thank you, BoopDoodles. 
   * The door:  JB's kitchen door is always open. To achieve this, I placed a diagonal wall. I first added the curtain, then added the door, scooching close to the arch that acted as a door frame. Finally, I deleted the diagonal wall. Personally, I think it's pretty cute!
   * Little bird paintings: in the cats & dogs expansion, your pets can bring you feathers. When you pull them out of your inventory, they turn into these adorable portraits of birds! I think JB is an avid birdwatcher (do I have evidence? no. Do I feel it is true? yes.), so these fit in great. If only I could match her Abraham Lincoln portrait! 
* The wood burning stove has a glass tile backing, but everything I tried looked ugly, so no backing for JB!
   * the passthrough window is the same as the dining room. Jess has horse head book ends, which I was able to approximate using the books from cottage living. They have little rabbits!!

**The porch**

Alright, I've got to admit I messed up a little here, both in my faithfulness to Blair house, and representing JB's house. I had trouble finding pictures of the porch, and assumed it was a full room, instead of just fenced or screened in (mistake). There's also a TOWER!!! that I didn't know about!!! till I posted this!! So this isn't an accurate room, but I do still like it. 

[the laundry room](https://preview.redd.it/n4umyjlgattd1.png?width=1321&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cd53246c1d702269bdd97659762737bcdf4955c)

* In terms of functionality, I would loathe to put Jessica in a house with no washer/dryer. So this became the laundry room!
* This is also a storage / mud room! please note:
   * loads of gardening stuff! 
   * Jess's tennies, for her 3 mile walk every morning. I think I found a pretty good match to hers!
   * rainboots, for Cabot Cove's inevitable downpours
   * an extra bicycle, and the bicycle repair kit! 

**Hallway**

ok this is gonna be quick bc i don't really care about it. It's a hallway.

[A screencap from season 3 episode 13, \\""crossed up\\""; a picture of the sims hallway from the same angle; a picture angled towards the door](https://preview.redd.it/qr4zfnfw4ttd1.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&s=58fa0617d5e017c19865e0a61de87ab6a69e3680)

There are only two interesting things here: 1) the extremely ominous mirror, & 2) trouble with paneling - Jessica's hallway gets slightly narrower as you approach the stairs, and switch to full paneling. I am unable to make subtle transitions like that - alas. I just used paneling on the stairs. Other than that, I just placed a couple of bookshelves & narrow tables full of tchotchkes. 

[the second floor hallway](https://preview.redd.it/6mdorhg4cttd1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cc2d28dcf67c957b4f372502f5824b0ed211fa1)

* not too much of note here - there's a mirror and a bookshelf in the back. A table, with plants & a bust. Just some general jessica-y clutter

the first floor mystery bump out just has a bathroom. It's boring and I don't like it, so I won't show it. But if you look closely, you might notice the dimensions don't add up ... 

does Jessica have? Secret rooms? 

my god.

(to be real, I am personally not a fan nor a believer in serial killer Jessica Fletcher. If anything, my theory is that she has a super active imagination that spins up murder plots in every situation she's in! But anyways, I had loads of weird little spots trying to match up the sound stages & blair house -- perfect for a little inside joke ;) made me giggle.)

Like the first friend, another friend has  plans based on her parents very good planning, and mirrored that. 

My parents moved to where we were. Eventually lived with us. In some ways maybe we were their elder care plan and that was fine as they came to us while still healthy and gave A LOT in terms of helping us raise our kids. Not that it was easy, but it was easier because we had such fond memories of their involvement with us when we were adults. 

We have a huge pack of kids. Apparently they have talked about the idea that at least two of them need to live near us and that everyone would need to pitch in financially for our care. The youngest one shared this with me.

We are all energy regulating machines in many levels: from our mitochondria working the basics, to whatever runs our drunk motivation centres (I imagine a Michael Scott type manager or two)... 

These are the factors I think affect my energy (and let's see if you agree):

1. **Socialising**: Hanging out with friends and family can really fuel me... until it doesn't, and I suddenly feel like a bucket of water poured out on the lawn. I can't get up and gravity is the only force in action
2. **Screen time and social media**: With a wide range of interests and a binging personality I probably consume too much. Ironically I'm really into digital minimalism on YouTube and podcasts...
3. **Sleep**: My post-medication work routine is very set to 8 hours a night, which I'm happy about. Power naps however, are like playing Russian roulette with both my time and energy. 
4. **Exercise and movement:** Exercise can boost my energy like nothing else, but it can also feel like being hit by a bus. I do both strength and cardio training 1-2 times/week. 
5. **Diet**: I'm omnivorous, with a relaxed form of intermittent fasting which (I think) works well for me. I've been loosely experimenting with vegetarian and low glucose diets, without any considerable findings. 
6. **Caffeine:** Historically I've been drinking a f-ton of coffee, but somewhat less on medication. Today I limit myself to 2 cups a day, never after 1 pm.
7. **Sensory input:** Bright lights or loud noises is draining. Sometimes having socks on is hell?
8. **Monotonous work:** Nothing kills my vibe more than repetitive tasks and the lack of new impressions
9. **Schedule**: Too much on my calendar, and I’m overwhelmed; too little, and I feel aimless
10. **Alcohol**: Do I even need to say anything?

At first I thought of this as an equation, and spoiler alert: the math does not add up! For me, this is a dice. The random nature of it gives me no clue of what to expect on a given day. Sometimes it feels more like a coin, as I'm often either incredibly energised or dead ass fatigued, indistinguishable from CFS patients. Just for context I do have a high blood pressure (avg. somewhat short of 150/100), but blood tests and heart scans are as good as they get, no deficiencies or thyroid issues. I experience dry mouth, restless legs, blurred vision. I'm late diagnosed, and during my childhood my fatigue was always pinned to seasonal allergies, which is laughable as this is a whole year thing. Yes, it was more turbulent before the meds, but I'm still significantly affected on a daily basis... 

This is not a mental hang up on ""optimising"" my life, I just want to be okay. We're all built different, but I'm looking for experiences and what you did to come closer to your own answers. How do your energy levels fluctuate, and what have you done to manage it? Is it a dice or an equation?",1,1728516401.0,ADHD,0,1.0,False

I really want to travel longer term but have to decide this month if I settle down a bit where I am now come next month, or pack up my things and travel. 

Ideally I want to do both, but money. 

So an idea I had was I could go and see Europe for the first time for at least a week or two now before I decide, then I can always come back!

I’m not looking to hop around every few days but would like to see a few places. My top areas I think I’d like are Italy, Spain, maybe Sicily

I'm Sharpie I'm from Glasgow in Scotland , I have an improvised date show called [Lookingforlaughs ](https://www.instagram.com/lookingforlaughs.ig/)and it's been doing pretty well, despite our shambolic Insta.

You'd start off blindfolded ,  we ask you a few questions about what your looking for in a partner. 

Then you have a lovely 12 minute date ..then we improvise using the date as premise.

Then we ask the audience should these guys date or not date?

I'm a 21M, 6'2, 215lbs, Hispanic. All my life, I've been generally considered healthy, never having to visit a doctor till 7/21/2024 when I fainted at a restaurant. It was a hot day and hadn't eaten or drunk anything in the morning. Was standing in line for 45ish minutes to get seated, till I told my mother I felt like I was going to faint, and fainted, falling back and hitting the back of my head on the door entrance ramp. Since that day, been feeling lightheaded 24/7. Did blood labs and everything was absolutely perfect, everything leveled. Went to a concussion specialist who said no concussion symptoms. Went to a neurologist and got an MRI and my brain is perfect, except for a finding of a rathke cyst/adenoma, still waiting on the results to determine which one it is. The cardiologist made me wear a heart monitor for 2 weeks and also an echocardiogram, which showed a perfect and healthy heart. Got two CT scans of my head and throat and nothing was wrong. The cardiologist believes it might be orthostatic hypertension, but after a month of increasing salt intake and electrolytes, nothing. Been to a chiropractor two times since the fall, but neck adjustments and back have not helped with the dizziness. 

Here is a list of my symptoms:

- Constantly feeling lightheaded and at times, near-syncope, no vertigo (spinning room feeling). Does not matter if I'm standing, sitting, or walking

- Symptoms worsen when at a crowded place and loud sounds. Went to a wedding and I felt very dizzy, wanting to faint while sitting down. My hands got sweaty, I was looking down to avoid the light, and taking deep breaths. Had to go to the bathroom several times to feel relieved and clear my mind. 

- I get chills in the whole body or sometimes from the neck to the back of the head

- There's a certain head position where I feel some tension running from my neck to the left back side of my head, which I think can crack or pop at the right angle but don't want to mess with that

- I have some left shoulder/shoulder blade pain from years ago from a gym injury. Mobility is limited when trying to do shoulder raises. Have constant soreness on the shoulder/rotator cuff and neck.

- There has been an increase in palpitations and inability to sleep on my left side which I used to do perfectly fine and not having to worry about feeling my heart thump faster or irregularly. 

- I do remember before the fainting incident, I had moments where I wanted to faint when standing up too quickly in the mornings. 

- I have not lost strength. Still able to lift, walk, bend, etc

- There have been times when I'm lying down that the dizziness gets bad like I'm wanting to faint while laying down! or times when I'm just sitting.

- My diet contains protein and drink lots of water (almost my body weight in water) and I avoid processed foods as much as possible. Never had alcohol, smoked, or caffeine from coffee or energy drinks all my life. 

- Sleeping 8ish hours of sleep every night, do have difficulty falling asleep earlier due to staying up late to study (taking 20 online college credits at the moment). 

If anybody can suggest something to help, please do. I'm a strong individual, but it's getting to me. I just can't handle going to so many doctor visits and not having an answer.

1g04uop,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1g04uop/my_endgame_dripfilter_coffee_setup/,My endgame drip/filter coffee setup,"# Overview

During the early days of the pandemic, I decided to get serious about making good coffee at home. My main goals were to get to the point where I could consistently make a great (not perfect) cup of coffee so that any difference in taste from brew to brew is due to entirely the beans.

Additional requirements are that my setup needed to be able to make multiple cups of coffee at once, offer quick enough brewing+cleanup so that I actually use it on weekday mornings, and be easy enough for my in-laws to figure out when they wake up before me and want coffee. Those criteria ruled out espresso, pour-over (i know...sorry r/pourover), and AeroPress.

I was left with figuring out how to make a great filter/drip coffee setup. I think I've achieved that as there is nothing left that I want to tweak/upgrade and I am enjoying great coffee every day. Just I wanted to share my setup here in case it helps anyone else with similar goals of brewing consistently great coffee with minimal effort. Most of the coffee nerd content I see out there is geared towards other brewing methods that require more time(espresso & pourover), complexity(aeropress, espresso & pourover), or money(espresso). Not much of it is geared towards 'how can I get my father-in-law who is content with blade grinder+$20 Mr. Coffee to make consistently awesome coffee?'...which is what I think I've achieved here.

# Setup

**- Grinder**: Baratza Vario W+

High-quality burr grinder with a large selection of grind sizes and a built-in scale which lets you program in your preferred mass of coffee beans. When it's time to grind, you just choose the pre-programmed amount and press play. This is critical for making the setup easy enough for non-coffee nerds(such as my wife and in-laws) to use. I previously owned a Baratza Encore conical burr grinder which I used long enough to wear through the original set of burrs and halfway through the replacement set. There were no issues with that grinder outside of replacing the burr, so, I was comfortable spending more money on their Vario W+.

**- Brewer**: Technivorm Moccamaster KBGT

It's a drip brewer, but is SCA Certified to deliver appropriate water temps and brew time. The thermal carafe also does a great job keeping the coffee hot without burning it like with a hot plate + glass caraffe. There are other high-quality drip brewers out there so you don't have to go with Moccamaster. However, I liked the aesthetic.

**- Water**: WaterDrop under-sink reverse osmosis system + Third Wave Water Dark Roast mineral packets

I live in Wisconsin and the tap water is perfectly safe to drink but horrendously hard and alkaline. So, correcting the water chemistry is essential here. RO systems can be pretty cheap(\~$100) or can be very expensive($>1,000). Any RO system will work, so shop different brands and feel free to save money here on a different RO system. If I were to get a new one, I'd look for a tankless RO system with standard filter sizes. Unfortunately, there's also an annoying lack of high-quality information on RO systems, so it's hard to know what is good/bad/bullshit. I don't have a solution for that, sadly, and I don't feel so confident giving particular recommendations here.

Using Third Wave Water mineral packets adds an ongoing expense for the mineral packets. You could make the cost negligible by making your own blend of minerals. I just prefer the simplicity of opening the packet and I also use the 5 gallon packets from Third Wave Water which are a better deal than the 1-gallon packets.

**- Syrups**: Routin 1883. On hand for when people want to add milk+syrup. Tastes much better than Torani + Monin and not so pricy if you buy in bulk.

# Discussion

I could not be happier with this setup. Definitely passes the ""in-law test"" in terms of simplicity. When they're visiting, I fill the water reservoir and bean hopper for them the night before - so, they just have to press the play button on the grinder, then put the ground beans in the filter basket and flip the single switch on the Moccamaster. The coffee is consistently awesome and brewed specifically to the taste preference of my wife and me.

If this were what everyone associated with drip/filter coffee rather than blade grinder plus a $20 Mr Coffee brewer, I'm certain that filter coffee wouldn't be looked down on. It's a perfectly great way to prepare coffee that lets you appreciate the beans.

Suggestions for others:

* Water chemistry matters - a lot! Switching from tap water to re-mineralized distilled/RO water is the single biggest upgrade to my home coffee. Without correcting water chemistry, it's not possible to extract the coffee properly. Beyond that, even the water on its own tastes much better which is important since coffee is mostly water. I had my neighbors & in-laws do blind tastings of tap water vs re-mineralized and they were all able to immediately pick out which was which...and they don't care about this stuff *at all*. Finally, by eliminating the hard water, I recover some of the cost from not having to clean and/or replace my brewing equipment quite as often.
* Improving the grind of my beans was the next biggest area for improvement. Grind size & consistency matters *a lot* and preference is highly personal. Early in the pandemic, my wife and I spent a morning tasting coffee at different grind sizes. For both of us, there was a region of grind sizes which we preferred over other sizes. Our preferred regions didn't line up exactly with each other but did have some overlap, so we selected a setting in this overlapping region for our daily brew. I think this was a really helpful exercise! Plus, *getting everything dialed in like this is only time-consuming up front*. Now that we know our preferences and have reliable good quality equipment, we can make better coffee at home on autopilot than we would get at any coffee shop in our city.
* In order to experiment with grind size, you need to fix other variables in place. What I did is just start with a ratio close to the 1:16 - 1:17 ratios that you typically see recommended for drip coffee. I don't think the exact ratio matters too much as long as you dial in your grind size appropriately for that ratio.

Notes on cost:

This isn't a cheap setup as far as drip coffee goes: $600 grinder + $350 brewer + $700 tankless RO system = $1,650 total. Plus, a small ongoing cost for water chemistry (RO filters + 3rd wave water packets).

If you're looking to save some money, you can definitely get a much cheaper RO system. You can also find a cheaper brewer and save another $100-150. Refer to the SCA list of certified home brewers. Finally, you can prepare your own mineral mixture for coffee following the steps in the 'How To Make Basic SCA Coffee Brew Water' video on YouTube.

I *wouldn't recommend cutting costs on the grinder*. I didn't find a comparable flat steel burr grinder for much less than the Vario W+. I also really like the serviceability and ease of getting replacement parts for the Baratza grinders.

Altogether, a cost-conscious but comparable end-game setup could be had for as low as $900-$1000 if you get a cheaper SCA certified brewer and a tank-based RO system. You could also look for a used Baratza Vario W+ or similar grinder to save a couple hundred extra dollars.

","TL;DR: my boyfriend smokes a lot of weed, distorts what I say, calls me manipulative, aggressive and overreacting, goes out to fancy dinners with his ex wife, and when I pull away then claims he loves me and when I come back he is mean to me and makes fun of me. 

My boyfriend won't cuddle with me when I am sleeping next to me, and won't listen to my emotions. I noticed that when we have sex, he won't look me in the eyes. I'm uncomfortable around him. I tried to break up with him and he told me we had to take that off the table. Then he blamed my mental health for why I wanted to break up with him (no serious mental health issues here). 

I went to a meditation retreat. It's been a long time because I am a single mom, so I've never done this. While I was there he went out to dinner with his ex at a fancy restaurant and called to tell me about it and made a big deal about it. I hated it. I asked him about calmly a week later. He blew up into a rage and started hitting a chair and got mad, asking me ""Can't I at least get coffee and go with her for walks"" He was in a rage, and it was my son's birthday. Later, two nights later, I reached out to him while we were sleeping and he said ""What are you trying to achieve"" 

Every time I've brought up my emotional needs he says they aren't positive enough, or whatever, that I am manipulative and aggressive. He went into a rage again, this time 4 am, hitting the bed repeatedly. I was scared to leave and scared to stay. 

I do not feel like he understands my perspective: namely that he has never validated my feelings or emotions, does not share his own emotions and feelings, refuses to discuss feelings, and insists on continuing to meet up with his ex. He also refuses to give her back stuff that belongs to her, even though she has asked for it back. 

  
He apologizes a lot about it, and then claims he wants me back, and as soon as I come back he is mean again. He will make promises on the phone, then blame me in his texts saying it is all my fault and I am the one behaving badly. He then claimed to say he would stop smoking pot, but I had no idea he was smoking that much pot at all, let alone seemingly every day? All day?

80% of the time, I have always struggled to be creative at home. It’s a strong reason as to why I put a hault in progressing forward in Animation as a career and have done a pivot.

The pandemic & a poor group project I was on during my time at University put a massive spanner in the works and heavily influenced the career pivot I have been making. Had neither of those things happened, I would have applied to the Animation internships/schemes i planned to apply to whilst at University. Working on my portfolio (for the means of completing University work for the world of work as a-posed to animating as a hobby) seems like a look of work to commit to completing for no guaranteed outcome/reward of real-life work. There’s little to no information online about ‘life as an animator’ online, in contrast to other industries who have tones, and the little (and recurring) information I do find online about Animation is often about how the Animation industry has no career certainty/stability & ‘starving artists’. The Pandemic putting a spanner in the works has meant alot is stacked against me, hence the position i’m in where i’m still unsure about what to do in life and contemplating which direction I comit to, given the above reasonings. I really struggle to work from home. This is how I feel… I struggle to shift and change my attitude, but outside of an institutional/school environment, I really struggle to be creative (in ant sense) at home.

Does anyone or has anyone ever felt similar? Has anyone pivoted because of this or even found solutions to overcome this?

Both during my time at 6ft Form college & University, 95% of the time, I worked in the university building or i stayed behind at school… it’s nice to be surrounded by other creative students in a creative environment.

Coffee shops are too busy (and can become expensive). My laptop is broken atm, so i can’t try it now, but if i remember last, i think my local library lacked space for my drawing tablet, and overall, didn’t have the settup I felt i could work in.
