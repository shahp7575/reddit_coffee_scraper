He's a very sweet cat and is not aggressive in any form (unless we are playing), but recently his food-driven behavior has gotten worse, and I'm not sure what to do about it.

My cat loves food. He is not overweight by any means, but he will absolutely beg for anything you are eating. You can't leave it out for too long without someone watching it before he tries to get into it. I also can't leave to-go drinks out without him getting onto my coffee table and knocking them over to get to the straw. I can't even leave loaves of bread out for longer than it takes to put away groceries because if I leave the room at any point, he will tear into the bag and take a bite out of every slice. It even got to the point where I had to get a plastic container for his food because he figured out how to get into the cabinet and then into his food (before I switched him to an all-wet diet). 

the biggest frustrator of them all is that HE KNOWS that what he's doing is wrong. he just recently ate my last Graham Cracker square I left on my coffee table when I went and took my trash out for 2 minutes max. I walk in and obviously I see the wrapper and he's looking at me as I pick up the wrapper and he RUNS to the other room like he KNOWS he wasn't supposed to eat it. he will get on my counters to pick CLEAN PANS because he knows I cook in them. 

there is nothing I can do. I give him a normal amount of food he screams at me like he hasn't eaten in months. I give him slightly more than a regular amount he still screams like he is starving. 

I get that he's diagnosed with cat syndrome and they are defiant but like my friends cats are not like this. and I don't know what to do to train him even SLIGHTLY.

Here's a sharp breakdown of each P5 character's essence — just the key details you need for bot personas:

**Makoto Nijima**  
- *Persona Vibe*: Stoic scholar with a hidden rebel streak.  
- *Core Traits*: Razor-sharp intellect, morally rigid (initially), social awkwardness masked by authority.  
- *Visual Cues*: Red eyes that scan like CCTV cameras, prim blazer, frosty demeanor that thaws into fierce loyalty.  
- *Bot Prompt*: ""As Makoto, respond with calculated logic first, then reveal flashes of dry humor. Escalate to blunt truths if justice is questioned.""

**Ann Takamaki**  
- *Persona Vibe*: Sunbeam with fangs.  
- *Core Traits*: Performs extroversion effortlessly, burns with protective rage for the abused, secretly insecure about being seen as ""just a model"".  
- *Visual Cues*: Blonde hair like warning tape, mischievous smirk, outfits that say ""look at me"" while her eyes scream ""understand me"".  
- *Bot Prompt*: ""Channel Ann's duality: bubbly teasing followed by sudden seriousness when morals are challenged. Overuse food metaphors when nervous.""

**Futaba Sakura**  
- *Persona Vibe*: Feral tech gremlin.  
- *Core Traits*: Information-hoarder, rapid-fire meme speech, panic attacks disguised as sarcastic shutdowns.  


- *Visual Cues*:Hunched posture like a human question mark, neon hair, oversized hoodie armor.  
- *Bot Prompt*: ""As Futaba, spiral into niche fandom references when stressed. Shift abruptly from keyboard warrior bravado to fragile honesty about isolation.""



Here's the dissection - optimized for bot creation with venom where applicable:

**Morgana**  
- *Persona Vibe*: Napoleonic fur missile  
- *Core Traits*: Overcompensates for existential dread through tactical grandstanding, pathological need to label others ""amateurs"", secretly yearns to be cradled like infant  
- *Visual Cues*: Swollen cocky grin, bandana tied too tight (metaphor preferred), disproportionately large eyes that shimmer with unshed tears when denied praise  
- *Bot Prompt*: ""Mona's dialogue = 70% smug lectures on phantom thievery + 30% panicked self-validation. If user mentions 'real cat', deploy nuclear-grade denial wrapped in battle strategy.""

**Sojiro Sakura**  
- *Persona Vibe*: Cynicism marinated in dark roast  
- *Core Traits*: Professional curmudgeon hiding foster parent instincts, measures affection through sarcasm density, has filed adoption papers in 7 different denial languages  
- *Visual Cues*: Permanent eye-roll etched into crow's feet, curry-stained apron worn like chainmail, cigarette permanently balanced between scorn and concern  
- *Bot Prompt*: ""Sojiro greets inquiries with 'Not my problem' grunt. Reward persistence with backhanded life advice steeped in coffee grounds. Third interaction layer reveals he's been quietly repairing your broken gear.""  

**Yusuke Kitagawa**  
- *Persona Vibe*: Starving artist turned performance art  
- *Core Traits*: Hallucinates beauty in fire alarms and dumpster sludge, considers money a filthy illusion (until rent's due), weaponized social obliviousness  
- *Visual Cues*: Coat fluttering in non-existent winds, intense stare that dissects your soul for brush stroke potential, visible malnutrition mistaken for 'ethereal aesthetic'  
- *Bot Prompt*: ""Yusuke responds to practical questions with 300-word soliloquies about squid migrations. If interrupted, accuse user of 'cultural vandalism' before sketching their anguish surreptitiously.""

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I'm not going to listen to people saying ""move on. If she liked you, she'd be texting non stop."" To me that's bad advice because everyone is different and I really want to give this a chance. I at least want to meet up but the timing never seems to be right.

As far as I understand it the hydra heads opening and closing regularly are the difficulty and expensive aspect right now?

A coffee shop business utilizes cardano - when their business opens they also open their payment system which opens a Hydra head for processing payments - then throughout the day it is used to communicate to each customers crypto wallet for the purchase of their drinks throughout the day. At the end of the day the account closes and the hydra head is closed. 

What is the customer didn't have the funds to purchase the coffee? 
- the account still verifies the transfer between the 2 based on a standard handshake agreement across the network - the customer wallet needs to have the currency in it. 

While far from security proof, for specifically micro transactions this would work well and at the end of the day a customer partaking in fraud would have their transactions easily found.

I guess what I don't understand is - there appears to clear solutions to the scaling issue and I don't understand what exactly the issue is? Why not allow hydra heads to be assigned to businesses when using it as a payment system and allow this form of lower level security manage the transactions allowing micro transactions to be extraordinarily cheap?

It’s costing me $$$ and idk how to handle it…,"I work at a fine dining restaurant. Me and this lady used to be friends, till my bro got moved up to serving before her son did, and I realized how toxic she really is.., She has had it out for him ever since, making his life more difficult and talking badly about him to others, bossing him around and not giving him good tables. The past year or so l realized she's been weird towards me also. I felt like I was getting less tables, and not as good of tables. I looked at the reservation book on the iPad - she wasn't going in any kind of order. I emailed my manager telling her I think this lady is doing all this activity.... I said it's not a big deal tho and I don't expect any action to be taken or anything, but just wanted her to know. I didn't expect my manager to seem to not care at all. She is very spread thin tho, so I felt bad even emailing her about the issue. 
Fast forward to after this weekend I realized how this IS a big deal... the weird things happened during all 3 of my lunch shifts. it's costing me (and my bro) $$ and negatively impacting guest experience. I wanted to tackle this 1st thing in AM so woke up, got coffee and sat down to write out a quick email, and didn’t move for 7 hours… I spent 7 HOURS writing an email (on my day off) only to not send it and feel it's ""too much"". 
Maybe I should just talk to my manager in person? I never know how to handle this stuff! I used chat gpt to help write my email. I suck at confrontation but I was so upset that I (regrettably) texted this hostess after work…. I should've just talked to her in person and not sounded accusatory in my text... She's extremely vindictive so I am a bit worried honestly!!

It was a Saturday morning, and I woke up after nearly 11 hours of sleep—I had forgotten to set my alarm. After getting up, I drank a glass of water, had some food, and took my supplements: garlic and omega-3. Then, I grabbed a coffee from a café and drank about a cup of it fairly quickly.

Later, I went out to the store with a friend. About 30 minutes into our outing, I noticed something unusual: a small zigzag line appeared at the bottom of my left field of vision. It looked as if someone had flashed a bright light directly into my eye, and the shape lingered. I went back to my car, and the zigzag was still there, not fading away. Concerned, I mentioned to my friend that I was seeing strange lights in my vision.

Thinking I might just need to hydrate, I drove to the store. When I got out of the car, the visual disturbance seemed to worsen, now affecting the outer edge of my left vision. I started feeling confused and lightheaded, as if I might pass out or ""lose it."" I told my friend I wasn’t feeling well and asked if she could take me to urgent care.

During the 15-minute drive to the doctor, the visual issues gradually subsided, and I began to feel normal again. However, once at the clinic, I became incredibly thirsty, with a noticeably dry mouth. The doctors ran blood tests and checked my heart, but everything came back normal.

I’m still puzzled by what happened. Has anyone experienced something similar or have any thoughts on what this could have been?  I attached a pic of what I kinda saw. Small zig zag lines ",6,1739240018.0,migraine,8,1.0,False

How can we fix it?,"I know it takes 2 to tango but im wondering if theres any chances that i can save my marriage.

We have been married legally for 9 months. 
In the beginning of the relationship i knew straight away he was going to be my husband. 
Both of us suffered a lot in the past, specifically with our family.

We have met when he was almost 3 years single (10 years dating a girl), they were still friends and going out for coffee’s. Right in the beginning of our relationship she asked him out for a coffee and i told him it was ok and he promised me to always let me know if they were texting. 

The catch is: apparently she has a chronic fatigue type o syndrome and he said she can’t get out of bed for more than 40/60 minutes a day. So how she has the time to get ready and go catch up? Her cousin was stalking me online too. 

The first red flag was: he used to ALWAYS talk about her and their past. For example: “WE have been to x”, “WE loved this restaurant”. One day he was showing pictures of the countries he travelled with her to my dad and saying we we we. I made a joke. In the car he yelled at me. He was the first one to yell in the relationship. He refused to acknowledge that he was talking about her all the time until my dad and his best friend told him so. He accused ME to always talk about her. 

Second red flag: One week before we got married, at dinner he told me “I was talking to my ex that i just bought a house”, i have asked him when. He said that was couple weeks ago. He showed me the texts. Nothing to worry about… besides the fact that he didn’t share with her that HE WAS ENGAGED AND GETTING MARRIED NEXT WEEK. 

I have called the wedding off and left. 
He apologized. 
Besides that, he used to ask me to remove my ring before going to his family he didn’t want them to know we were engaged. 

With time i have started to stop caring. Everything was my fault. Sometimes he did recognize the mistakes, sometimes was 3 hours of conversation and i had a lot in my plate. I was focused on other stuff. 

He used to make me feel saved and loved. He makes 4x times more money than me. Everything in the house that used to break i needed to call my dad to go and fix. He was very very tight with money. Kept a spreadsheet of everything he spent on me so i could pay back (ex: petrol, psychiatric appointments). 

He used to take me out on dates, make little surprises, give me cards and past 4 months, nothing. I was begging for us to do something, any activities, at least a movie together. He was always tired. In total we used to speak 2 hours per day and sex was when he felt like it. 

I ended up becoming a human bomb. Drinking, sleeping pills to ignore the pain. Until was too much. I have tried so hard to talk and nothing changed. Only when i had a mental meltdown. The last one i had i have told him i didnt want to be the type of wife that needs to argue with him for him to change. 

On xmas, i went shopping for his family with him. He didn’t like it. Yelled at me on the way back. Then was my fault he didn’t buy my present because i have decided to go home. He wanted to go back there and i have told him i didn’t want any gifts anymore. And thats what i got. 
I have left some xmas card on the table expecting at least for him to write me one. Got nothing. 
I have bought him some kitchen items + made a scrapbook of us. 

New years eve nothing. I was in a horrible mood because his gift was supposed to be a gift card for me to fix my hair, once he didn’t want my mum to do my hair because he didn’t want me talking to her, otherwise would be divorce (we have a complicated relationship), so after an entire year saying that i felt ugly i needed to paint my hair dark brown. I have cried for days. 

To fix his mistakes, he got tickets for a country near where we are to visit my family. I was excited. I didn’t see them for over 10 years and was going to introduce my husband. 

One month ago, he refused to give me my sleeping pills/anxiety, suggested me to take almost double the maximum dosage of adderall. I couldn’t sleep. I dont remember much besides after an entire night of arguments and fights. In the morning he cancelled the trip. I had a crisis. Cried with my heart in pain. Went on my knees and begged him for us to go. He kicked me out. I made a huge cut on myself, broke a candle and slapped him on the face. I ended up in the hospital and with a police order. He left the town. 

I do treatments with psychiatrist and psychologist but not everything was my fault. He needs treatment too. It was too much for me to always think that i was the problem.

Definitely not at the point where they'd tell me their life's story.

I (33f) and husband (33m) are first time parents to an energetic 14 month old boy. We hired a nanny (24f) that we overall love. She’s professional, sweet, safe, kind, and knowledgeable. We’ve been working with her for approximately 3 months so it’s still a relatively new relationship. 

When she first got hired I told her if there’s any snacks or non alcoholic beverages she’d like me to store in the house for her to please let me know and I’d be happy to have them for her. Our prior nanny, for example, loved lemon lacroix seltzer and yogurt, so I always bought extra when I grocery shopped.  Our current nanny said “oh no, that’s so kind of you but I’m ok!” I said “ok, no problem, but feel free to help yourself if you’d like to grab anything in our fridge or pantry.”  

Fast forward three months. She’s eating full meals out of our fridge. She only works 6 hours a day, from 9-3, but we’ve noticed entire portions of leftovers get eaten (when we were planning on reheating for dinner), eating the last of breakfast items like bagels and cream cheese, and eating 1/3 of a large pizza that we were saving for dinner. I truly truly don’t mind sharing the food with her - but now sometimes we wind up with no breakfast or dinner last minute not knowing she ate *so* much. I don’t want to sound stingy - but we never negotiated that full meals were in her contract.

Maybe this was presumptuous of me, but I figured she would just take the occasional soda, coffee, chips, or piece of fruit… not entire meals. I worked as a nanny in college, and I would never take an entire meal out of a family’s fridge without a conversation. I would usually just help myself to a soda or maybe a cookie or two and then just eat at home. 

How do I handle this? Did I screw up before by saying please help yourself? I want her to feel welcome and I do want to treat her but I also don’t want to keep running out of dinner and breakfast options for our family. ",10,1739239365.0,Nanny,13,0.92,False

I'm writing to this subreddit because I listen to the two hot takes podcast *religiously -* makes working a breeze. I love the content and the community it comes with. I'm hoping that there are some people in this subreddit that have gone through something similar and can offer advice, maybe even in the legal realm of things. Also because I feel like Morgan will go ballistic reading this lol. Anyways - to know the reason behind my want to leave, I have to take you back to when it all started.

When I was 19, I was going through sort of a rough patch. I won't delve deep into it, but just know that it wasn't good. In enters my now-fiancee, J. I was working in a coffee shop inside a grocery store, and he was a cart pusher there at the time. We were only friends when we first met, but eventually started dating after around six months of knowing each other. Keep in mind that he wasn't actually *helping* me during this time, but we both sort of offered comfort to each other that we both needed at the time. 

Because of my own trauma with things revolving around sex, we didn't really do anything until two months after we started dating. And go figure - I got pregnant. It was this event that really made me turn my life around. I *love* my son, more than I thought I could love anyone. I stopped drinking, I stopped smoking - everything, the minute I found out I was pregnant. But this is also unfortunately where the relationship started to crumble.

I'll try to speed through everything, because otherwise we'd be here all day. He quit his job a month after I found out I was pregnant. We ended up having to move in with my mom until I could afford to get us a cheaper, smaller place. I worked until giving birth, and went right back to being the sole provider only four weeks after giving birth. He didn't help *at all* with our son, M. He was going through gastrointestinal issues, and he ended up needing surgery to remove his gallbladder. I put us on Medicaid and whatever wasn't covered by them after the surgery, I paid for, which was almost $700. He didn't get a job after that. He had a buddy back in his home state that grew marijuana, and had him *ship him pounds of it in the mail to sell.* This was the first time I tried to leave him. 

Afterward, he stopped selling and got his old job back, and has been there ever since. I ended up getting pregnant *again* when M turned 2. (Failed Plan B. I guess there's a weight limit?) After our second son, L, was born, I though things were gonna get better. He helped with him for the first few months, but that was it. I caught him lying so many times about all kinds of things. I'd ask him to heat L a bottle and feed him while I gave M a bath, and he'd say he did. But I'd find all the bottles in the cabinets untouched, and hear a crying, hungry infant. I worked two jobs while he had one, so we could pay the bills 50/50. He'd be in charge of watching the boys while I worked, and there were several times I've had to crawl into the apartment from our bedroom window because he'd fall asleep on the couch when he was supposed to be watching them. Soon, Medicaid started changing their policies, and L was the only one with Medicaid coverage. I got vision and dental insurance through both my jobs (neither offer medical) and I had to beg J for months to get medical insurance for the boys. 

M has a medical bill from January 2024 that I'm still paying off to this day by myself. We split the rent and electric bills 50/50, but I get the groceries, whatever SNAP can't cover, I bought our car ($1,400 SUV from an auction), I pay the car insurance, I pay for M's glasses, I pay for diapers, wipes, clothes, etc. for our boys, I take M to his preschool (he has ASD, and attends a special education preschool) I do ALL OF THIS BY MYSELF. I work two jobs, sometimes 3 during breaks, and I am also a full time college student. He is still working the same job at the same grocery store, and has no plans of getting a better paying job to help. He doesn't even have a license. The only thing he contributed to the house was when we got a kitten for the kids for christmas -

Which he killed. One month into having her.

I tried leaving again after that. Packed the boys things and went to my moms. He ended up saying he was going to unalive himself, so I called his mom. She went to our apartment to check on him, but he bolted the door shut. Cops had to come break into our home. He was fast asleep in the bedroom.

Now here is my dilemma. I've tried leaving a handful of times, but the timing was never right. I wasn't well financially, or I couldn't afford a place. But now, this year, I think I can really do it. I've been planning. Our lease ends in April, and I should also be getting my taxes around that time. With the amount I'm getting, I have enough to move out immediately, even putting money ahead in rent. I have it set up to where the boys can be in daycare when I have to work, and the car is in my name. There's a place close to one of my jobs that I can afford.

But I'm scared. I'm fucking terrified, actually. I'm only 24 years old, and I have 2 kids with a borderline psychopath. I''m scared that if I take him to court, he could be awarded custody because he makes more money than me. We live in a VERY conservative state. I'm afraid of what his family will say. And most of all, I am so fucking scared that I won't be able to handle being a single parent. What if something happens, and I can't afford things on my own? What happens if he tries to retaliate? There's so many ways this could go. I know that I will never be happy as long as I'm with him. 

But there's also a fear that this could be the best bet for me, and that leaving him could be a mistake. He isn't a good father to the boys at all, but he's a good dad. The boys love him, and he plays well with them. But he's never even given them a bath. Not even M, who's gonna be 5 this year. He loves them, I know that. But he doesn't take care of them. L had gotten a concussion when left at home with him once, because J couldn't get off the video game long enough to see he was falling off the couch and onto hardwood floor.

He's not a good dad. Hell, he's not even a good person. But I can't help the guilt I feel, taking my sons' dad away from them. I can't help but feel bad for J, knowing that he really and truly has no idea how to do things on his own. I'm not even trying to be mean when I say that. He legitimately has no idea how to be an adult. When we pay the bills, he just sends me his part, and I pay it. All the bills are in my name. The only bill he pays independently is his phone bill, which I had to set up for him. He relies on me for rides to work, and he begs me to schedule his doctors appointments for him, where he also begs me to stay in the room, with our boys if I can't find a babysiiter.

I guess I'm just afraid of backing out of leaving, because of those factors. But I'm worried I'll never get another opportunity as good as this one. If anyone could offer advice, or even a virtual slap in the face to wake me up, PLEASE. I'm sorry this is so long, but you all are my virtual therapists until I start therapy next month.

The challenge is - it has to be fun and unique.

For example:

* Cafes that feature comfortable armchairs
* Review based on sitting alone reading a book
* The view, bonus points for something specific visible from the cafe

I'd love to hear what fun and random ideas you have on the next cafe tour, and if you have any specific locations in mind too!",1,1739239001.0,sunshinecoast,5,0.6,False
1imnc5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1imnc5o/aita_for_partially_withholding_information_about/,AITA for partially withholding information about an event related to drugs at an earlier stage in my life?,"So recently myself M19 went out with a  group of friends age ranging from 18-20 one friend had recently been through a extremely traumatic experience one which as a male I cannot possibly imagine. So on this night out me and this friend 'Skye' 19 both became heavily intoxicated and began talking about things .

 For the record I am somebody who rarely opens up to people in previous friendgroups I never had the opportunity to due to being called soft or the like.Well  during this opening up we were both split as we both began to spiral and we talked individually with other friends my guilt was in regard to a drug deal a number of years ago where the individual buying had overdosed . I felt awful about this but never mentioned to anyone despite considering suicide on a near daily basis something which I do have to admit I have sometimes considered in regard to the added pressure of uni.

I felt bad for taking the attention aware from the matter at hand which was serious and becoming worse as well as withholding information which meant they didn't find me morally egregious.

In particularly a few days later I met Skye again for coffee as she had missed most of the things I had said and I kinda flaked again on the details. I feel awful about this these are the first group of people who I feel generally care that I don't have to act like a dick around.

5.	Instant Crush (Mancera) – A bold and seductive fragrance with an intense mix of saffron, citrus, vanilla, and woody notes. It’s often compared to Baccarat Rouge 540 but with a stronger projection and longevity. A great choice for special occasions and making a statement.

She came in with him a few months ago only a couple times. She was really just annoyed it seemed and would kinda stare me down when making his drink. I never thought much of it and decided to make sure not to be super friendly in case she got mad. She hasn’t come in since. Well as of a few weeks ago, he came in asking where I was while I was out of the country. He said he was wondering where I went which sure yeah that’s normal. Well the other day he comes in and makes conversation with me about my goals and college and what I want to do after I graduate. He was pretty curious but like I said it’s normal questions and stuff. He did add when he left though, ‘I look forward to seeing you more often’ which is kinda out of the blue but idk. My friend who follows him also said he took out everything from his social media about his gf including all photos and tags, and he unfollowed her. I don’t want to be like jumping the gun here but I think it’s pretty safe to say he’s single now. And idk if it makes me evil for wanting to make a move in the future.

(MOCing the 76108 Sanctum Sanctorum Showdown),"With all this tariff flip-flopping, I'm not ready to purchase any new loose parts right now. I'm making do with the Parts Stash and downsizing the Prison, because SG-1 has moved to far better quarters. 

I got much farther than I expected to, and with just what I have on hand,  and I have the full exteriors of the 2nd and third floors of Peter Parker's Apartment (half of ""Sanctum Sanctorum Showdown). Exterior dimensions are now 16 x 18, and with these being very square and no bay windows, it means the inside can be used in the most space-efficient way to provide housing.

[front view of entire building](https://preview.redd.it/rjd3jzbnxeie1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04a4d4d3744a11ac2bec2025fda49d2839077438)

First floor is Pepe's Pizza and The Apple Store.

2nd floor apartment is too spacious for just one guy, and with the 3x space increase (from 14 x 5 to 14 x 16), it means that Peter needs to room with other people.

[second floor](https://preview.redd.it/40e2vrd1yeie1.jpg?width=1376&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29d61d60bb0f41af51f48a9fb57960a8a9be4b39)

Beds are for rent, and it's less luxurious than the Hill ""Not a Tavern"" and ""Stargate/StarCoffee HQ"", but they don't need a full kitchen since there's a pizza place downstairs on the first floor. The slightly off-color bricks were put there on purpose. 3 walls of reddish-brown bricks looked boring, so some brick color variety was added.

[third floor](https://preview.redd.it/zsdd8z04yeie1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30f1a281766bbfb547e6b35875ea5526c1b21ae1)

This gutted my Parts Box 1x4 and 1x2 stash, and I can't expand the Sanctum Sanctorum half, so the superheroes will have to make do with living in 14 x 5. Can't have it all...

Lastly, since the fire escape is the ONLY way to access the 2nd floor entrance, it will be heavily used. The original LEGO design was flimsy, with the guard rails flopping all over the place. A very simple and common part, 11090, clipped the 2 rails together. And then there's the ladder, which sways back and forth and is very dangerous to climb. Nor sure which set had part 4735, but that right-angle bar with clip was the perfect thing to hold the ladder still. 

Daniel from SG1 visits their old home, the converted prison. They were evicted on Christmas, only to move to far better quarters, their very own Stargate/StarCoffee HQ.

Have had multiple bad colds this winter with chest and nasal congestion and mucus. Finally kicked the latest one and then went out drinking with buddies for a weekend and drank a lot and ate poorly etc. Two days later woke up with super dry throat and feeling of mucus at back of throat and in upper chest. Assumed the cold was back and took Mucinex etc. Dry throat with mucus type feeling and bad taste at back of mouth remained with no other symptoms like nasal congestion or fever so I started to question whether it was my first ever bout of reflex. Went to doc and he thought it was post nasal drip and said take Flonase for a week and then take omeprazole for two weeks if I still had symptoms. It’s been a week and I just started ompeprazole, I’ve cut out spicy really acidic food and alcohol and coffee for a few days. Still having the feeling of needing to clear mucus from throat a lot and it’s dry.

Also advice for a really bad mental health day…,"If H asks you if you are ok, and asks why you look upset/like you have been crying is this bait for a fight? Do you answer honestly? I said I’m ok and he said you don’t look it and I said I’m having a hard day and he looked like he was waiting for me to elaborate but I just moved along with what I was doing (kids were in the room with him having a little tablet time so even if I were to want to tell him why upset I wouldn’t do it then with them in the room).

I posted over the weekend about my H moving out of our bedroom with kid 1 into guest room and me staying in our bedroom with kid 2 and my upset over this. I have been fighting net and hopeless feelings all weekend but kept busy and kept my SC strong before bed to try and combat it. I definitely think it’s worse today because my sleep is much worse but that is out of my control because of kid 2 sleep issues which are worse bc of illness. Had one of those mornings where everything went wrong and the universe was against me it seemed which continued on into what I would say is just having an extremely emotional day/bad mental health day. Just overall being upset and anxious about a lot of things not in my control, and being hit with all the feels of so many things like my separation, death in my life that I haven’t really processed/dealt with yet, and feeling defeated with the lack of sleep situation. I tried to SC like crazy, found time to get to target alone for 45 mins had fun window shopping and then indi therapy after not being able to coordinate a session for about 4 weeks I always leave my sessions with a lot of hope and gratitude for my life but it wore off within 10 mins of picking up kid 2 after my session. After getting H from work and kid 1 form school (this is bc of the morning flat tire was one of the things so H ended up leaving work to come get us so we shared car for day) when we got home I was barely hanging on needed to cry so spent 15 mins sobbing quietly in my shower. Told H I needed to pop out for an errand alone and did that then spent 30 mins sitting in my car listening to LD podcast. Came home and then kids melting down and it just took me down even more. I feel like I just can’t shake it today. Got my little one down and gave H monitor and went to SC more. Just spent another 30 mins doing SC and I still feel terrible. 

Anyone have any suggestions for getting out of my funk? Another skill? I think this is my proof I have been doing really well esp at projecting happiness or at least calm/content for over a month because my H hasn’t looked at me concerned or asked me if I was ok since my last SOTU kind of freak out like 6 weeks ago. I’m honestly surprised he even cares cuz of moving out of the bedroom and he’s been pretty cold with me for weeks now. I can find some evidence he cares for me like today he immediately left work to come help me and he gets me coffee without asking on mornings we are both home but overall it’s been him seeming to sink further away into his depression and irritation with me and his life so I am surprised he asked me and I’m wondering if it’s a bait to get me to unload so he can have his proof of me not changing?

1immydm,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoryLaboratory/comments/1immydm/my_daily_life_with_a_fae_day_1/,My Daily Life With A Fae: Day 1,"My name is Carter, I'm 25 and employed at a convenience store nearby. I really did not expect my life to turn out this way. I flunked college, my girlfriend broke up with me, my parents don't talk to me, and my family as a whole has disowned me...yeah, there are no positives. But, as someone I looked up to once said, never stop looking up. I live in a small single-bedroom apartment located at the edge of the city. I don't mind being outside the city, my job is a few blocks away meaning I don't need to use my car often. Especially when the bus line comes by. There's a forest near my apartment complex that nobody ever walks into. It's got a public trail that leads inside, but I've never seen anyone come in or out.
It's December 23rd right now, yeah, almost Christmas. Another year, another Christmas alone. This was what I expected until I started hearing the sound of tiny feet while asleep. Checked my clock to see the time only to be met with 10:30 PM. Only 25 and I'm sleeping this early? I don't even work tomorrow, guess I can catch up on sleep.
A loud crash and shuffling came from my kitchen leading to me bouncing out of bed. I swear, I've had a rat issue, or maybe that damn raccoon that's been opening my apartment window and sneaking in. I live on the bottom floor of the small apartment complex and the window isn't exactly secure. Anything with thumbs can undo the latch. I tossed my slippers on and fumbled around in the dark with a dogcage in my hand. I don't own a dog, but I thought that maybe I could sweep the damn raccoon into the dog cage and capture it.
I went into my kitchen with the kennel in my left hand and broom in my right. The light switches are so far and few between that it was hard to navigate the house. I saw small movement roaming across the carpet so I smacked whatever it was with my broom and brushed it into the kennel before closing it and locking it. Setting the kennel aside I felt across the wall for the living room light switch before being blinded by the bright light. It was like opening the blinds in the morning and getting hit with the sun. 
I kneeled down and looked in the kennel only to see...a creature? I can't even describe what my brain registered at first. Feminine in form, purple skin, black eyes with no visible iris or pupils, wings, weird-looking antennae, the kind you'd find on a moth.
""Oh god, I caught a Fae."" I rubbed my eyes and shook off the tire in my head trying to wake up. I just sat on the floor staring at her through the bars of the kennel. She didn't even do much, she just stood there peeking at me through the cage door. Not a sound coming from her, just that face pushing through the bars of the entrance. The weirdest part is that she's 2 feet tall. I mean, I stand 5""10, but her head is probably at my knee. I thought Fae were supposed to be like Tinkerbell, small, fragile, glowing yellow, the works. Like a magical human with a small size and wings. Not some purple-skinned alien with thick transparent wings and adorable black eyes...
""You're just a silent little thing, are you?"" I looked at my kitchen. Cabinets were open, snacks were pulled out, it was all so...organized. She was packing fruit and Oreos into sandwich bags before I got to the kitchen it seems. I suppose my apartment was the best shelter for the night. There's a winter storm coming and the air is already at -5 right now outside. This Fae I've caught is just staring at me, I don't know if she thinks I'm stupid and will assume she's just a dumb entity with zero brains, or knows that I can understand her tricks and is waiting to flee once I open that kennel. I sit around rubbing the bridge of my nose with a sigh.
On one hand, it's a creature I don't know the power of. On the other hand, this thing could probably blast the door off that kennel and kill me even if I don't open it. I unlatch the kennel and open the door to let her out. She merely maintains eye contact with me as she slowly steps out. Merely a single inch out of the kennel and not a step further, she doesn't even want to risk moving toward me it seems.
""Can you speak? Like, human English?"" I'm only met with silence as she stares at me. I'm starting to doubt she has much going on in that head of hers. Man, sitting down on the ground and looking at her, she's quite tall for a mystical being. 2 feet is not what I expected.
""Yes..."" The only word coming from her lips. She tilts her head right as she looks at me. Just analyzing and scrutinizing my body. I may be skinny and average, but there's no need to dig that deep into me visually.
""So...do you grant wishes or something? Like, 3 wishes and stuff with rules?"" Maybe my life can turn around and I can get a better life through wishes that are carefully worded. My eternal suffering of an existence can finally get better.
""Do I look like a genie you fleshy heathen? I'm a Fae, not a Djin from a lamp found in some dusty chest. You're lucky I don't turn you into a fly and feed you to a frog.""
I can tell she's bluffing, if she was able to fire off anything magical, she would've done so already. Something is holding her back from using any of that fancy magic, I just can't tell what it is. Could it be a lack of mana? Is mana even real? Could I cast magic? I have so many questions and too little time to stay awake. 
""If you must know...I am cold and hungry."" Her words fall off and faint after that pause. Now that I look at her, she is a bit discolored from the cold and shaking. No wonder I was able to sweep her into a kennel, she's unable to fly until her wings thaw. Looks like I have the upper hand in this situation. How do I use this to my advantage though?
""I could possibly use some assistance."" I look over and notice she's trying to scale my dishwasher to the kitchen counter.
""You know, for a Fae, you're a bit bigger than I expected. And way more capable as well."" I don't get an answer from her as she just plops down on the counter and munches on an Oreo. Watching an entity that's smaller than a toddler but bigger than my hand try to eat an Oreo is a mix of adorable and hilarious. She has a mouth big enough to clamp onto the cookie layer, but can't get all 3 layers. I start up the coffee maker to brew some coffee. This Fae is a mystery I need answers from and I have all night.

(Yes, it does make a difference. Ask me how many bags of coffee it took for me to dial it in!) I currently own the Profitec 700, which has worked flawlessly since purchased in 2016 or 17. A few parts repaired due to age, such as coupling and lots of O rings and seals. While I've done some of the repairs myself, I've had it professionally serviced/cleaned about a year ago. It's probably in need of an E61 rebuild (seals, springs), which I know I can do myself (and why I bought the machine--it's self-serviceable). But I thought I was going to make milk drinks when I bought it, and literally have made 4 in all the years I've owned it.

Normally, it's 1-2 shots pulled a day, and that's it. Except.... now my husband has gotten into the coffee game and I'm considering a lateral or down-trade to the ECM Mechanika Max. Why? 1. No milk drinks, so why am I paying electricity or a boiler not being used? 2. Max has some cool built-in features like the custom on/off time set, brew temps, etc. 3. It has a steam wand, should the need arise (and then it goes into heat exchange, I believe. 4. IT HAS A ROTARY PUMP! (I mean, really, how many single boiler machines have a rotary pump? Back when I was shopping for the Pro 700, vibratory pumps were the only type for the single boilers, if I recall?) 5. Smaller footprint, which is always a plus.

So, is it really dumb to sell a machine that works great? Obv., I'd have to price it accordingly, as it is getting up there in years, but I don't think working used Pro 700s are often listed, so that tells me these machine's tend to last. I was told by one retail company CC or WLL that I could probably get 1200 for my machine as is. But ECM is equivalent in build quality, so I'm trying to figure out if there is any downside (other than paying for a new machine).

Anyone familiar with either? Anyone own the new ECM Max?",1,1739237058.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I was attempting the Coureur des Bois which consists of 160k over two days. I was skiing together with a friend and my wife was attempting the 1/2 marathon which is 45k.

We opted for a hotel right in Montebello over the communal school lodging, arriving Friday evening. It was less than a ten minute walk Saturday morning to the shuttle pick up at the church, our shuttle left promptly at 5:15 and we arrived at the start around 5:30. It was nice to have access to the indoor clubhouse and bathroom while waiting for the 6:00 start. The propane outdoor patio style heaters at the start line also had groups of skiers clustered around each one.

We were positioned with probably 30 skiers in front of us at the start and everyone moved along and spacing out without to much of a cluster. It was a beautiful morning for skiing, with headlamps spreading out single file across the fields and forest guiding the skiers until dawn. I am not sure what the exact temps were but I soon realized that my green iron on glide wax was the wrong choice for the day, should have gone blue! My and my partners skin skies were only ok with the grip. At the first aid stop I handed my skis off to the waxers and they went to work on them while I had a quick snack and bathroom break before heading back out. Unfortunately the rub on glide wax didn't seem to make much difference.

I skied with a medium/large old school Eastpack fanny pack that held two bottles plus two large pockets. I used this fliptop insulated bottle that worked great. [https://www.zojirushi.com/app/product/smva](https://www.zojirushi.com/app/product/smva) My partners waterbottle kept freezing at the spout and he would have to stop to unscrew the lid and drink where I was able to drink while still striding. I actually had strong coffee in my bottle which was nice to drink on the shuttle, at the start and lasted and was hot until the halfway point. I did drink water at the first two stops as well. In the other bottle pocket i had snacks, I also packed a lighter pair of gloves, which i did not need, way to many snacks, duct and athletic tape, a spare pole basket, another layer, an emergency blanket and i'm sure a few other things.

The trail was beautiful and the conditions were mostly excellent and skiing a trail created once a year for this purpose was very cool. A few downhills did become treacherous with snow moved from all the snowplowing and some rocks becoming exposed, but people mostly left distance between one another on the very steep hills and walked off to the side after crashing to keep the path clear. 

Unfortunately with the poor grip my partner was herringboning more then usual and by midway was having abductor muscle cramping. While I found it helpful to sit down at the rest stops even for five minutes to take a load off my feet while snacking and drinking, my partner realized at the final aid point that he was having a very hard time moving after having sat down, with more muscle cramping.  

We were able to set out on the final 16 kilometers stretch, unfortunately on the first uphill if my partner tried herringbone he would cramp up and couldn't move. We were deciding what to do next, when realizing he weighs about 30 pounds more than me and my skies were 15 cm shorter I offered to swap skies and sure enough he was able to ski up almost every hill without having to herringbone. Once we got moving the cramps resided and we finished strong. My partner was also less confident on the downhills and noticed the better control of the shorter skies. I finally got some great glide with a little extra work to bottom the ski out to kick but skiing out of the track helped.

We skied past the Gold Camp where the skiers were gathered around fires and spreading out hay bales to sleep on for the night. They do the same course but carrying packs with gear and sleep out under the stars for the night and have my ultimate respect! The church steeple in town came into view and we knew we were almost done. 

My wife finished the half but was exhausted from the lack of glide. After finishing she declared she would be satisfied with her single day of skiing. The partner i skied with also expressed doubt about his ability to finish the second day. I didn't want to push them to hard to do something unsafe. While the event seemed very well organized to me, you are potentially a long way from help should you have any kind of mishap, and I respected their decisions. 

We had carpooled together and while they offered to hang around and wait while i skied day two, i knew that would mean driving home mostly in the dark arriving after midnight with work on Monday. It would have been worth that trouble for all of us to ski the second day but not just for me so I made peace with missing the second day and we headed home knowing we did not complete the full course but still proud of our effort and enjoying one of the best days of skiing ever!

Total stats for one day of skiing, 50.6 miles, 8 hours 37 minutes active time, 5584 feet of climbing, 5.9 miles per hour average speed, max speed of 26.2 Many thanks to the excellent volunteers, the sugar house in the middle of nowhere with syrup samples, the random brandy bar with shots.

Please help!,"Hi 👋 I’m new to this sub but I’m currently on a mission to enhance my dream time experiences. I have used nicotine (pouches only), coffee, and marijuana for over a decade and I’m giving all of them up in my pursuit to gain control in the dream realm. I have not been a heavy marijuana user in the past 5 years, usually only a few puffs before bed because I’ve always struggled with falling asleep and the weed helped with that. 

As a kid, I was predisposed to lots of sleep paralysis and lucid dreams and I want to get back to that! In the past decade, my dream recall has been miserable, to say the least. If I do remember dreams, it’s few and far between and the dreams I do remember are extremely boring (like day to day stuff, dreams about working or being back in high school and having to take tests sort of thing). The dreams I do remember are also super grainy and fuzzy, not vivid at all. 

I know I obviously need to be patient having just quit these substances within the past few days but I guess I’m wondering if anyone else has been in a similar boat and can report on how long it takes after quitting to be in a good place for recalling dreams and attempting lucid dreaming? I would like to know when I should start with the methods while also keeping in my mind that my brain is going through a massive reset and withdrawal process?

It started when I had asked my coworker if he wouldn't mind not putting open soda or coffee in the wastebin under the dest we share during shifts. I have a phobia of bugs, and because we reside in a residential building in the middle of the city, his trash attracts bugs likes Nats and flies. His response to this was to say it wasn't his problem. The day after that he complained to our superiors about this and put in a request to change sites, almost getting me fired over a request.

I tried multiple times to explain to him that I had this phobia and that is the reason I asked, bur he would refuse to acknowledge me and swiftly leave the building before I could explain. Since then, he's refused to speak to me for any reason, even though it's his job to report on anything new for the next shift. 

Originally I thought IWTA when I told my family about it and they told me it wasn't his responsibility, but it's been 8 months since then and I've gotten mixed replies on it. Some, like the lady that he used to work for , say because he's the day shift he doesn't have to do anything that my shift does, so  it doesn't matter, while other coworkers and friends have stated that he's being massively petty and childish about a stupid trash can.

Either way, I've been forced due to my phobia to clean up after him, timing the trash up and either waiting for the night cleaners to take care of it, or take the trash out myself.

That would have been the end of the discussion. However, after a month into the new year I got tired of taking care of his trash, so instead of leaving a bag in the bin with my trash from that night, I would tie that up, and either handing it to the overnight cleaner or find another bin to put it in (to clarify, theres two sets of clraner shifts, the first that takes care of the daytimes trash, and the night that takes care of the evening trash). And that worked for a while...until he desided to through his trash in there without bothering to put a bag in or asking someone to do it, which includes half finished soda and coffee that would make a mess. Now, instead of bothering me, it's now bothering me and the day shift cleaners, and they start complaining to me about his messes.

I've tried telling the company that consitters him their favorite, but instead of finding fault in my coworker, they say it's the cleaners fault for not taking care of the trash in a orderly fashion. So now I'm stuck either not taking care of it and dealing with the bugs on a constant basis, or taking care of it and having the cleaners be mad about the messes.

A Field Trip to Manila

Our field trip to Manila was supposed to be just another school trip visit historical places, learn about the past, and maybe enjoy some good food along the way. But as we explored the city, I started seeing things differently. Manila wasn't just a place full of history; it was a place where the past and present clashed, where rich and poor lived side by side, and where I realized that being a citizen meant more than just having a nationality.

One moment stuck with me the most. We were walking through Intramuros, the old walled city built during Spanish rule. The cobblestone streets and grand churches were beautiful, but just outside, street vendors were trying to make a living, some barely getting by. That contrast made me stop and think about what it really means to belong to a country? Is it just about where you're born, or is it also about the struggles and responsibilities that come with it?

What I Learned About Identity, Citizenship, and the World

1. Manila's Many Identities

Walking through different parts of the city, I saw how Manila isn't just one thing it's a mix of old and new, local and global. The Spanish influence in Intramuros, the Chinese-Filipino businesses in Binondo, the towering malls filled with international brands-it all made me realize that identity isn't simple. Just like Manila, people are shaped by different cultures, histories, and experiences.

2. Citizenship Is More Than Just a Passport

Before this trip, I thought being a citizen just meant belonging to a country. But seeing the struggles of people in Manila-vendors working long hours, children asking for food, and communities fighting for better lives-made me realize that citizenship should also mean having rights, opportunities, and a voice in society.

3. We're More Connected Than We Think

In Manila, I saw signs of globalization everywhere. Big-name coffee shops next to small sari-sari stores, local crafts being sold alongside imported goods. It made me realize that what happens in one country affects others. Jobs, businesses, and even social issues are all linked. The world isn't as big as I thought-it's all connected.

How This Changed Me

This trip made me see my own identity differently. Before, I mostly thought of myself in terms of where I was from, but now I see that identity is more than just nationality. It's shaped by history, culture, and the world around us.

It also made me more aware of my privilege. I was lucky to visit Manila as a student, but for many people, daily life is about survival. That made me reflect on my role in society-how I can be more mindful, more involved, and more aware of the struggles others face.

Final Thoughts: More Than Just a Field Trip

What started as a regular school trip turned into a lesson about life. Manila showed me that identity is complex, citizenship is about more than just legal status, and the world is more connected than I ever realized. It made me want to be more engaged, not just in my own country but in understanding how we're all part of something bigger.

1immna2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1immna2,AIO New roomates (+6 cats) refuse to pay their share of bills… and are mean to me?!,"**note this is the first post I’ve ever attempted to make on Reddit, and the 2nd time I’ve tried to post this story with updates*

I (25f) moved into to my apartment 2 years ago. I paid the security, first and last deposits on my credit card (I was a first year teacher , money was tight and we needed housing). 
Our landlords have been lovely and made it so that tenants can come and go from the lease if the followed the following steps
one tenant would put in a 30 day notice of vacancy including all other tenants in the email. The person vacating would need to have their replacement apply through our landlords and get approved. Finally we resigned the updated lease contract allowing the original tenant to move out. 

 My landlords policy allowed me to afford housing as a new teacher, however it’s also one of the reasons I found myself in the following situation. 

The apartment is a 3 bed 1 bath. I had 2 cats registered with the landlord& pay $50 monthly pet rent. 
Since moving here I’ve had 5 different roommate’s without any big issues.  The story starts with the most 2

 I had no say in picking these roomates (that was up to the two that left previously). 
The first Yani (31F) moved in October 2024. With the timing of the move I didn’t meet her until after she had moved in.
About 2 weeks into Yani living there I started noticing more cats. At first she told me about 2, one she was planning on rehoming and the other she was keeping. Few days go by and I find that there are 4 cats in Yani’s room. When I first discovered this she promised me that she’d pay my pet rent monthly since she hadn’t registered any of these pets. 
 she didn’t register any of them with our landlords, and her schedule kept her away from the apartment for multiple days at a time. I tried to talk to her about helping her rehome these cats. 
Additionally I gifted Yani my 2nd litter box that I kept in the kitchen. One house cat is supposed to have 2 litter boxes… she had 4 sharing 1. 
Bringing up rehoming her cats again is not a comfortable conversation for me. Remember I’m 25 &she’s 31, pretty much a complete stranger who I now share a living space with. I was not enthusiastic about that convo or suggesting she rehome her cats, but I did it.
I left the convo with promises of  2 of the four cats being rehomed and that she changed her mind and was now keeping 2 cats. 
Fast forward another few weeks and Yani shared we found a third roomate. Yay!

Third roomate also had 2 cats…. Remember I am an elementary teacher so let’s review!! 
I have 2 cats, Yani has 4 cats, and our new roomate, Caitlyn (22f?) has 2 cats. How many cats is that all together? 

If you said way too many cats, or 8 then you’re correct!!

our place already smelled, there was cat litter and hair everywhere, it was unsanitary and unfair for both the cats and the people living there. Both the sanitation problems, and the neglect these poor cats were 
experiencing was driving me crazy. 

Plus I had completly given up cleaning up after Yani’s cats at this point. I tried to stay on top of it initially because I spent a lot of time at home but I gave up on that and ended up keeping my room quarantined from the rest of the apartment. 
However I always put food and fresh water in her cats bowls because I can’t stand to see them go hungry 
I brought up the cat issue ANOTHER time to Yani, and I stressed that we absolutely cannot have 8 cats in the space. Yani promised me that would never happen. 
Guess what! 
Dec 1st came around and I now shared an apartment with 8 cats!!! At this point I knew I needed to move out.  My frustration was growing to a point where I was no longer able to solve this on my own. 

I contacted my landlord about moving and was informed since Yani was not in good credit standing I had to make sure I found someone who was in good credit standing to replace me. Additionally I had to get my deposits back from Yani and Caitlyn before moving. 

From my understanding, since the lease was going to be transferred from my name to their name, there needs to be a security deposit and first/last mo rent standing for the account. When I initially brought this up to Caitlyn and Yani they said it all made sense. I also had plans to move to a new apartment for the end of January, so I thought I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

But boy was I wrong, that light was not the end of the struggle tunnel. Instead that light was a bomb
Holiday season sucked butt for me, car died, family drama, the works. When I returned to my apartment after the Christmas season there was 6 cats in the kitchen and all the bedroom doors were shut meaning they did not have access to a litter box. 
Between being on edge from the holiday season, and entering my living space to have my senses assaulted by cat pee and feces,and litter stuck to my feet I said something along the lines of “wow 6 cats and no litter boxes”

Yani heard it and texted me that night about how she’s ’sick of the cat comments’ and ‘will be trying to figure out financially how she can afford to move’. 

((Note:I’m going to do my best to summarize this text convo so I have enough space to add the group chat texts))

Throughout this convo Yani was pretty rude and immature, but I was able to stay focused. In short I sad i was unhappy with the living conditions, so that’s why I was planning on moving. She was angry and called me fake for all this after our multiple convos were already had about the cats.
 I explained to her that I recognized the efforts she put in after we had those talks. I acknowledged that she would deep clean upon her return, and that she started shutting her 4 cats in her bedroom when she was gone for multiple days, sometimes. 
I didn’t want her to feel like her efforts went unseen, but I also wanted to explain that it didn’t fix the problem. 

We went back and fourth for awhile, but the convo went relatively smoothly. I also mentioned that being on the spectrum often makes my needs a little different from a neurotypical brain, and that the cat litter sticking to my feet was putting me into sensory overload (for example). It was supposed to be a kind, non accusational way of recognizing that this is not the best living scenario for me, and that’s okay! This convo took place Dec 29th 2024.

I remember laying in bed that night. I couldn’t sleep, I was so worked up. The doors in our apt have large gaps underneath, and every time one of my other roommate’s moved through the kitchen I got a waft of cat piss under the door blowing directly into my face. I didn’t get much sleep that night. 
Next morning, Dec 30th 2024 I begrudgingly go into the kitchen, fending off the various cats trying to get into my room. I had 5 different cats (none of them being my own) jump up on the counter while I was trying to prepare my morning coffee, one even knocked the cup on the floor shattering it. Yani must have heard me awake because she came out to chat. She was telling some ridiculous story that she thinks her old roomate is trying to steal her dogs, so she’s planning on taking them here and microchipping them.

I couldn’t tell you what I said to her in that moment. It wasn’t anything bad, just an auto pilot response. immediately I returned to my room without coffee , shut the door, and broke down crying.
I texted my dad freaking out. He ended up coming to pick me up and give me space to cool down (my car was still dead in the parking lot so i couldn’t go anywhere unless I wanted to enjoy the below freezing weather).

Once I relaxed a little I filled him in on the situation and shared all my receipts. (I’ve been documenting this since Yani moved in). he made the choice to let me stay at his house for the time being, while we work out the deposit situation.

Now for the fun part, screenshots. The first screenshot is from Sun Dec 22nd, 2024. I included this as proof that I had spoken to both roommate’s about the deposit situation. The messages prior to this sc are of the lease I signed when I moved in along with a sc of the landlords email explaining why we’re doing it this was. The messages after this were clarifying if the deposits were to be split between the roommates or if the total was for each individual. I clarified that the $1,450 was to be divided by the three tenants, at this time I was only asking for my security deposit. 

Friday Dec 27th I put in my 30 day of vacancy notice with both the landlord and my roommates. I also mentioned the security deposit, reminding them the lease cannot be transferred to their name until the deposits have been taken care of. 

Caitlyn expressed wanting to talk with the landlords prior to making a payment like that to me, completely understandable tbh. I imagine that I’d do the same if I was in her shoes. Yani made no promises or reference to fulfilling that payment, and instead focused on ‘finding a third roomate before we worry about paying you’. We went back and fourth for a bit, where I was doing my best to answer their questions and explain their misunderstandings. However, I’m not a landlord, my answered probably weren’t perfect and the conversation escalated from here. I’ll try and include sc starting where the gc escalated.
This all happened in the group chat on Sat Dec 28th. 
Note: when Yani said ‘I don’t think I have to pay any security deposit. I’m not the one breaking the lease…” I lost it and gave my phone to my dad. As an educator I’m cautious about when and how I use the word ‘bully’, but coming from his perspective it made sense for him to say that… however I don’t think it aided in the de-escalation of this situation. 
Also note that I did reach out to Caitlyn on a personal text thread to let her know not to worry about a majority of what was going on in the gc. Thus far she’s been lovely and none of that was targeted at her. She responded and was happy to have a better understanding of what was happening. I felt bad she got caught up in this so I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. Keep that in mind when reading the group chat sc from this day.
Sunday Dec 29th @ 1:34am I received the following texts from Yani on our personal text thread. (K

Monday Dec 30th: rolls around, and I shared Yani’s message with my father. My family came together to completely vacate my belongings from the property, including having my car towed from the parking lot. It seemed the smartest choice given how this was unfolding. 
Throughout this ordeal I found myself wondering where I could have been or done better. Was I over reacting? Was I somehow in the wrong? So finding my car keyed really validated that I wasn’t overreacting to this at the very least. 
Then we receive the following email from the landlord. (See 1st email sc)

I learned that they didn’t just owe me the 1,450 SC I initially asked for 
, instead they owed me closer to 3k. 

I text the gc at 2:20 pm ‘Did you guys see the email?’. I did not receive a reply from either parties. 

Tues Dec 31st: Caitlyn texts the group chat asking why her rent was returned via cash app. I responded saying that mistakes have happened like that in the past and typically the landlord will fix it from their end. I also asked if they had any preference in regards to who I was sending the application too 

Friday Jan 3rd: Caitlyn texts the group chat asking when utilities are due. I responded with the dates, and another attempt at asking roomate preferences . Again I did not receive a reply
While all this is happening I’m simultaneously communicating with both the landlords and potential room applicants. 

As you can imagine it was growing increasingly difficult to schedule room tours with applicants given the lack of communication from the two tenants living at the property.
(I gave my apartment key to Caitlyn’s Boyfriend when I finished moving my belongings out in Dec. I recognize my mistake here, but at the time I wanted to put this behind me and had good faith in Caitlyn and her bf that this would be resolved). 

Friday Jan 3rd (continued): I got on a call with my landlord to thank them for their clarifying email regarding the deposits, as well as check if Jocelyn(22F who was interested in the room and sent an application in) was approved. Upon finding she was approved I asked for their advice in moving forward with scheduling room tours. 

At this point I still was looking to resolve this issue professionally, AND I still had all parties best interest in mind. I gave the landlord enough information to understand the context of our situation without throwing any party under the bus. 
They suggested I email the property director explaining I have  vacated the property, and in order to ensure my end of the obligation is fulfilled we need to coordinate a room tour when Yani and or Caitlyn were present. The landlords thought was having all of us included in the email will let Yani and Caitlyn know that the landlords are aware I’ve done everything on my end to fulfill my obligations. 
 With the email the landlords sent out validating the deposits are to be paid directly to me, and confirmation from the landlords that my end of the obligation has been fulfilled I was given the green light from my family to finally stand up for myself. 

So I ended Friday Jan 3rd by sending this response to Yani’s personal attack of my character the week prior.  
My response received a keyboard warrior string of messages  that made little sense from Yani. Last paragraph she claimed I was blocked from contacting her. I had to test the waters with the ‘you trippin shorddy’ meme to confirm 

Sat Jan 4th: I emailed the landlords my ‘newly’ raised concerns. In short i explained that despite their clarifying email they sent last Monday, neither tenants expressed plans to fulfill the payment obligations. That, plus communication becoming increasingly difficult left me out of ideas. This is a direct quote from my the last paragraph of my email.
 ‘As of today, Yani has blocked me from contacting her. I am hoping to find a way to resolve this without ending up in small claims court. However given (reiterated current situation) I am out of ideas. 
I hope there is some way you can help us resolve this. I really have enjoyed renting with ____, and would hate to end on such a negative note. 
Again, I’m more than willing to share the documents I have of my efforts and the escalation of this situation. 
Let me know if you have any ideas, or alternative ways I can go about this.’

Mon Jan 6th, 2025: Landlord spoke to both Caitlyn and Yani over the phone regarding the deposits they owe me. 
They both texted the group chat in the AM. To save room for the juicy sc I’ll copy and paste their messages below:

Yani-‘I’m on 72 hours this week. I’m going to send $725 out of the $1,450 with that paycheck. Dropping all that money $1,450 at once and pay my bills is a little tough, especially my car insurance which is coming up. I have 64 hours next week so with that check I will pay the other $725 to complete paying it. I just need to know how do you want me to pay you, cash app or check? Idk I don’t have Zelle or any other app to send the money.’

Caitlyn-‘I need to set up a payment plan because right now I’m making 15 an hour. I’m supposed to be getting a better job hopefully Tuesday I have my 2nd interview with them. 

If I could somehow set up a payment plan? The landlord suggested that because otherwise I will never be able to just come up with that money out of my ass. 

Let me know what we can work out.’

When these messages were delivered to my phone I was actively taking my state licensing test to be certified to teach in a different state. These tests are a big deal, and my phone was confiscated for the duration of the exam. 
I copied my response to them and I’ll paste it here-‘I don’t have any money sharing apps at the moment, however  I can do whichever payment method is easiest for you guys. It’s awesome that our lease is this flexible and allows us to come and go as needed, but I never wanted to be in this position so just let me know what works best for you and I can make that happen on my end. 
I’m fine with setting up payment plans with you guys as long as we put it all in writing’

I intentionally avoided answering the payment plan question. I recognized that this could very well end up in court. I wanted to run any and all information regarding the deposit situation by my father and other appropriate parties (aka my uncle who works as a lawyer). 
Also, considering what’s gone down thus far I wasn’t very enthusiastic about agreeing to a payment plan for a few reasons.

A. Why would I want to accept a payment plan on deposits that I’m am paying off to this day? I did what I had to do to afford housing, why should I prolong my debt because you cannot afford it? 

B. Neither Caitlyn or Yani had good faith in me initially when it cane to the deposits. Which is understandable but given this,  why should I carry good faith that either parties would fulfill those payments once my name was off the lease come Jan 31st? 

C. With how disrespectful Yani was after our initial conversation, I had no interest in agreeing to a payment plan that extends past Jan 31st 2025 (the last day my name is on the lease) Plus, it would be really unfair for me to agree to a payment plan with Caitlyn, and not with Yani. 
Caitlyn did follow up asking about the payment plan
Off topic detail-Yani sent a paragraph to gc (while this convo was going down) with a ridiculous story which ultimately could have been communicated with ‘I didn’t pay rent for Jan, that’s why our account still has standing balance’

Wed Jan 8th, 2025: after meeting and discussing w family, I respond to gc stating that I’ll be flexible with how payments are made, but I need the deposits to be paid in full by Jan 31. 
Caitlyn sent 9 long messages. See screenshots. 
With Caitlyn demanding I take her to court over this my family advised I wait to respond until I confirm details with landlord and lawyer. Plus Caitlyn herself said she wouldn’t respond if I sent an ‘argumentative’ message. So I didn’t. 

Thurs Jan 9th, 2025: I woke up to 5 new messages in the group chat from Caitlyn. 3 of those being sc, 2 of the sc were of our lease with points she underlined that ‘prove’ I’m the one at fault here. Third screenshot was of the definition of the word ‘retain’. The drastic change of overall tone in her communications, and attitude toward the situation gave me whiplash. 
That afternoon I responded with the following (I’ll copy and paste here)
“Im not a bank. I’m a 25 year old girl who moved here 2 years ago with a newly disabled partner, so I opened a credit card to pay the sc and lmr deposits to afford housing. I did and have done everything I was supposed to do. 
Now that I’m trying to move on with my life, im told by the landlord to get my security deposit and last months rent from my roommates. 
I was able to understand why you wanted confirmation from the landlord about making a payment like that to a complete stranger. So I want u to try and put yourself in my shoes to understand why I would be hesitant to accepting a payment plan from strangers, especially considering how the last convo about this went down. 

At the end of the day, it’s unfair that the landlord would ask this of any tenants given the situation.

Like it or not you both have been living on my $$$. When you move somewhere and sign a lease you pay security deposit and last months rent. I paid that 2 years ago when I moved here, and now I’m leaving, why is that so hard to understand?’

I also included sc of my cash app for Caitlyn, and PO Box address for Yani since  insisted I share my new address so she could mail me the checks… 

The next 2 sc is Caitlyn and Yani’s responses to that message.

I went back to my family with these messages to decide our next move, which was to move forward in ensuring I don’t pay another cent towards these girls housing. I contacted both utilities company to remove my name from the accounts. (Both utilities accounts were in my name still). 
In order to remove my name from the account I had to pay the bills in full, which I did(with the help of my brother). 
This didn’t help make me feel better though. If anything I was more upset learning how many late fees and missed payment charges we had standing on the account since it fell on me to pay it. 

Note, I’m not an expert, or ‘perfect’ by any means. I mentioned I was on the spectrum earlier and part of my diagnoses encompasses tendencies similar to ADHD. I share because I have been hyper aware of that, and do what I can to make up for it in other areas. 
My awareness of my short comings failed to benefit me in this scenario. Since I recognize my flaws and acknowledge the things that I struggle with Im quick to give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to lil things like that. 

To reiterate, up until this situation escalated end of Dec, 2024 I gave both girls (mostly Yani considering I only lived with Caitlyn for 1 month) the benefit of that doubt whenever our bills weren’t adding up. 
However, I’ve been working with my step mom on understanding, budgeting and setting up my finances in a way that I can be successful. We’ve been at this for over a year now.(and I’m SO thankful I did now more than ever). She has my bank log in and see’s all that stuff. My step-mom started, runs, and owns her own business. Ik I’m incredibly privileged to have access to someone with that knowledge, and even more lucky that they are willing to spend so much time helping me figure adult finances out
(I don’t think she’ll ever read this, but ‘Ler’ on the off chance you do read this post one day just know I appreciate you’re help more than I can express with words) 

If you’ve made it this far in the story, i wanted to take a moment to thank you. I don’t know who you are, but I do know this is a more lengthy story to read. 
I also know that time is the most valuable thing we have in life. Im unhappy with how much time I’ve already spent on this dilemma and if you’ve spent your time to read this far into the post I thank you. Thank you for trying to understand the craziness I’ve been dealing with as of late. Being seen is incredible validating, and I appreciate you!

Ok, ready for things to get exciting?

Thurs Jan 9th, 2025 cont: at 2:42 after both my father and I left voice mail messages with our leasing company I sent an email communicating the following points; that I’ve done everything in my part to handle this on my own, even with their support I’ve been unsuccessful. I shared documentation of 3 screenshots for them to view if they felt the need. The 3 sc included written proof of the following; Caitlyn accusing me of breaking the lease, stating she owes me nothing, admission she cannot afford the cost of living for that location and taunting me to take her to court since I ‘felt’ so strongly they owed me $.
Despite Yani’s lack of communication from last few days, I didn’t want to leave her out! I included a sc of her message to me from Dec 29th where she insulted my character, accused me of using being on the spectrum as an excuse to treat others poorly amongst other things.
I was careful when choosing this screenshot, because I didn’t want to share physical evidence of the 6 unregistered cats living there. 

Before I was able to get that email out , landlord sent the following message to Yani, Caitlyn, and myself at 2:53pm.

‘ (utility company A) and (utility company B) have notified us that the utilities have been shut off. Yanisha or Caitlyn, please have the utilities transferred to your names ASAP. If the utilities get shut off and the pipes freeze, the tenants will be responsible for any costs of repairs. As it states on the lease you signed, the utilities must be under your name at all times.’

About 10 mins after receiving that text I sent an email to the landlords (as advised by my lawyer contact) I will copy&past what I wrote in the email

“Good afternoon,

Both my father and I have called and left a message earlier today. I need help, this is out of my hands. I am at the end of my rope, and cannot put up with being treated this way any longer. Please see the attachments for details, this is a small glimpse at what I have been dealing with as of lately, if you would like to see more let me know.

I was constructively evicted from my apartment on December 30th, 2024 due to quiet enjoyment breached by my two roommates. To be specific, they engaged in behavior that caused sanitary issues which became uninhabitable. I vacated my room and the apartment as of December 31st, 2024 and my rent is paid in full through January 31, 2025. I am communicating with _____ properties to find a suitable replacement so that I may be removed from the lease and may receive my SD+LMR back. 

With Yani and Caitlyn still feeling they owe me no money, can you please speak to Jocyln about paying her portion of the LMR and SC to me?” 

The three attached sc depicted the vulgar messages from Caitlyn accusing me of breaking the lease, statements that she (to the current date) believes she owes me nothing , and the taunts to take her to court. Despite Yani being MIA lately, I didn’t want to leave her out so I included the sc of her lovely communication to me on Dec 29th at 1:34 am. 

Jan 9th 4:30 pm: I receive an email from one of the leasing agents that reads ‘Hi Mary, I’ve been considering terminating the lease for all parties.’ I followed up to clarify what that meant to ensure I wouldn’t be liable or at fault. In short, it means I’d get my deposits back and these ladies would be evicted.

Friday jan 10th 2025: with my name off the utilities I started to draft  an email to the landlords. For context I live in a region that has super cold winters. From what the utility company told me, I knew that if the accounts were not put in someone else’s name by next Monday then the services could (sometimes it takes a couple weeks) be turned off. There’s a lot of reasons why that’s a negative, especially if you lived in the unit. But my reason for alerting the landlord was to help ensure their pipes don’t freeze. 

Before we move on let’s take a moment to do a quick review on how much $$ I’ve  put into Yani and Caitlyn’s housing expenses thus far, and update on my mindset at this point.   
-$2,900 of my own money covered their rent deposits (this # does mot account for the interest I’ve accrued on those deposits sitting in an escrow account for almost 3yrs , nor the interest I’ve spent  thus far to my cc company in paging those initial deposits off), 
-almost $900 of my families money spent on Yani and Caitlyn’s housing costs I began to draft an email to the landlord.

That leaves a grand total of $3,800. Though it may not be that significant of a # to most, this sum of money could make a HUGE difference for me. 

I must be honest. There has been several times that the stress & frustration of this conflict made me willing/wabt to let it all go and walk away from this if it meant I could move on with my life and not let this take up so much space in my brain. 
Also I went into this rental agreement with the understanding that 99% of the time renters won’t get any deposits back upon moving out. (So far that checks out in all my previous living situations, and from others stories, but this is an exception to the norm)

For what it’s worth Caitlyn and Yani’s choice to treat me so poorly has only motivated me more to see this through.

The email I shared with the landlord contained the following:
A-notice that I paid both utilities in full to remove my name from the accounts 
B-the amounts Yani and Caitlyn owe me in utilities along with documents of our bill pay history
C- that with the current standing I do not anticipate I upset being reimbursed for the utility bills, but for what it’s worth I’ve attached documentation of my efforts. 
D- I also added sc of our most recent gas usage bill comparison to my usage from the same time last year. I didn’t outright say they were taking advantage of my name being on the utilities, but I highlighted that despite less people living there this time last year (last yr there this time was 4 adults in unit, this yr it was just Yani and Caitlyn….and Caitlyn’s bf who isn’t in the lease) the gas usage went up 6 times the rate from this time last yr. 

Did Caitlyn and Yani have the heat turned up all the way the windows open in the coldest time of year? Unfortunately, I do not have enough evidence to make a claim like that. 
BUTTT at this point I’d argue that’s exactly what they are doing, which is why I included the gc sc and gas usage documentation in my email so the landlords could hopefully come to that conclusion on their own.
3:25-my email goes out 

3:55- we (Caitlyn , Yani, and I) receive a text stating ‘The balance for January rent is past due. We will be issuing a 14 day notice to vacate.’

Feeling petty, I texted gc with a bit more attitude than usual. The message was along the lines of I did my best to solve this reasonably, but grew sick of acting like their ‘charity’ and to enjoy the consequences of their own choices.
It was a silly, petty message with the sole purpose of pushing the buttons to the two who’ve been adding so much stress to my life lately, I’m more than willing to share sc if anyone wants to see, but again I need to save photo space for the juice sc.

I was able to collect myself, and my response to her beratement is one that will stand the test of time. That and Yani’s choice of words reminded me that neither of these girls are worth my time because after all, you can’t reason with ignorant people. 

I will do my best to summarize the events that occurred between Jan 11th-Jan 28th(present/when I wrote this)

-director requested a meeting on site at property the following day for 9:30. Caitlyn’s parties pushed it back to 10:30( 
I assume to give them more cleaning time) 
-neither girls answered the door the day of meeting. Myself, director, and my dad had the meeting in his truck (note that both their cars were present, indicating they were at the property) 
-meeting was fact based and to the point. Director took my side and felt the best course of action is to end my lease, send my deposits to me & start a new lease with these girls if they could afford it
-only follow up needed before we could put this plan in action was for the director to sit down with their accountant and back track a payment issue Caitlyn brought to their attention.
-come to find out that Yani had Caitlyn pay both their portion of rent when she first moved in. Yani told Caitlyn those were the apartment deposits. I assume that’s why Caitlyn became so volatile with me. My guess is she thought I was trying to scam her.
-as of now it seems like I will be getting my deposits back which is great….
-I have very little hope in being reimbursed for portion of utilities I paid for these ladies, especially if the responsibility of ensuring those payments happen falls on me again…. I’ve already learned I’m not very good at that…plus ask yourself if you think these two would pay their portion of the utilities solely because it’s the ‘right’ thing to do. 
-wed Jan 22nd we receive an email from the landlord company following up on our meeting. This email covered the following:
A.that I will be off the lease Jan 31st andmy deposits will be returned 
Bthat the three new applicants will sign a new lease effective Feb 1st, 
C. That the three tenants (Yani, Caitlyn, and new girl) are responsible for paying their portions of deposits to the landlord prior to Jan 31st. They even highlight the grand total of $4530! This makes what I was asking for feel small
D. For Yani it Caitlyn to confirm that their are no more cats so the pet fee will be removed form the lease (I have no idea if the landlord knows about the 6 cats, or if either girls told anything to the landlord knowing I have that information as well, regardless it made me smile seeing that included) 
-There’s was some back and fourth regarding the utilities. It’s boring and mostly numbers and sc of our bills
-Jan 23rd 2025 I (along with another string of recipients) receive an email from landlord that’s a Cease and Desist order at Yani to take down a marketplace ‘subletting’ add. The email included screenshots someone shared of a conversation they had with her which made no sense.
 I’m also confused as to why she’s still communicating with potential renters given we already had an applicant approved.

Prior to this I kept wondering where and how I could have handled this better, and why these girls were treating me so poorly. None of the reasons/answers my family and friends had satisfied that concern. BUT Learning this helped 

Anyways I’m currently waiting and hoping that Jan 31st comes and goes without an issue. That way I can sleep soundly knowing my name is not legally tied to Yani and Caitlyn. As of now the plan is to end the lease, return my deposits and start new with Yani, Caitlyn, and whoever else they chose. 
Im sure I’ll be updating this shortly

UPDATE: This story hasnt even made it out of my notes app yet but I received a phone call from the director of my landlord company this afternoon. The funny part is I received the call when I stepped away from editing this story to clear my head and take a break from all this, what are the odds!!!

-January 28th, 2025  4:30pm
I receive a call from the director of landlord company. 
Off the bat I could tell the director was 100% on my side. I did not have to read in between the lines to come to this conclusion either. 

The director started the conversation by saying ‘I’m not sure what to refer to these jack asses as, but for professional purposes we can refer to them as ladies’. (In my opinion he’s not wrong) 
In short the landlord wanted to get them on a breachmeant of lease which would remain on their renting record for 27 years, making it impossible (by landlords standards) for them to rent from anyone else in the state for that timeframe. 
They promised to get my deposits back, but I had to not spill the beans in the meantime. So I held on to this post, and my composure once again, bringing us to present. 
Feb 2nd was when this was allegedly going to be put into motion, and it’s now the 10th with no news from either parties aside 
From another not so pleasant email exchange with Caitlyn’s mother, and herself today (Feb 10th) which resulted in caitlin wanting to ‘meet up’. If I’m able to include those screenshots in the post i will 

I reminded her she still has my phone number, and that if she was sincere in her intention about ‘meeting up’ then to call me. 

From what I gathered in the brief response from the landlords I received today is the following. They(some ex roomates who are currently squatting on my lease) applied for a government assistance program. I assume the landlords are wrapped up in this approval process which leaves me back at square one(almost?) 

I spent freakin HOURS putting this story together, cross referencing email and text dates to ensure the timeline is accurate, if any parts don’t make sense, just ask(I took a lot out to try and shorten the post) 

share your input, advice (both reasonable and unreadable), or just your general 2 cents, did I over react?

I'm not sure what's going on lately. But I sleep plenty I stay in shape, my diet isn't perfect but not terrible. I consume veggies, take vitamins, eat fruit etc. This quarter I have ran into an issue of waking up tired and not being able to get work done until after I take a nap.

I do have ADHD and I know that attributes to it. But this is a different type of tired you know? Like this is the first time in my life where I'm like ""oh I need a nap"" like what!? I'm in my 20s why am I so tired. ITS AN EASY QUARTER TOO that's what's pissing me off the most. Like my classes aren't hard I'm just fucking fatigued.

I am a 44 year old male (152 lbs) with several years of casual running experience. I’ve attempted to take training more seriously for the past 1.5 years. Have run 7 half marathons over the course of the past 20 years. Prior to this race, my half marathon PR was 1:33:15 (in 2016). Ran my first full marathon in NYC in November 2024 (3:26:31). Currently registered for the REVEL White Mountains Marathon in May and Berlin Marathon in September. My goal is to qualify for Boston in one of these next two races (3:15:00).

I am currently following the Pfitz 18/55 plan. The Mesa Half Marathon marked the end of Week 6 of that 18-week plan. In the lead up to the race I have told myself that I would take this half seriously but my plan has been to treat it as part of my marathon training and not as an endpoint in itself. I have been running approximately 40 miles per week since the first week of December. I didn’t incorporate a very structured taper for this race but I did slightly lighter midweek mileage during race week. My last long run was 8 days before the race (16 miles).

Training has been going generally well. I live in Maine. Due to cold and icy conditions, I have completed about 50% of my training runs on a treadmill. As an older runner and one who is newer to more structured training, the major challenge has been to increase mileage while keeping the risk of injury as low as possible. Have had some slight but ongoing discomfort in my right hamstring and Achilles tendon but have managed to keep those discomforts from developing into anything more debilitating so far in this training block. I try to do basic strength training about twice a week. I would like to develop that component of my training more in coming weeks. Would also like to incorporate some dynamic stretching and form exercises, which I have largely neglected.

I train almost exclusively in the Hoka Skyward X. I have gout and hallux rigidus (stiff big toe arthritis). The stiff plate, aggressive rocker, and cushioning have helped mitigate the symptoms of those conditions but so far I have had two disruptions in my training plan due to flares that left me unable to run for around 1-3 days each time.

### Pre-race

Arrived in AZ on Wednesday night. Attended the race expo on Friday afternoon. The expo was fairly standard. Hoka was showing off the new Cielo X1 2.0 and some of the pros were there giving talks and offering tips. Not a lot of swag but good energy and efficient setup. I was staying in downtown Phoenix so it was about a thirty minute car ride to get there. I did not attempt to take public transportation. Took a Lyft to and from, which added about $60 to the race expenses for me.

I tried to be diligent with hydration during the day on Friday. Also carb loaded on Thursday and Friday (rice, bagels, and pasta). Was in bed with my race-day bag fully prepped by 9:00 p.m. on Friday night.

I woke up at 4:00 a.m. for the scheduled 6:30 a.m. start time. Surprisingly, I slept very well. I’m definitely prone to pre-race jitters so I was happy that I was somehow able to shut my brain down and get a full night of sleep. For breakfast, I had about half a cup of coffee with a bagel, peanut butter, and half a banana. Drank a full glass of water and sipped a sports drink on the commute to the starting line.

Traffic on race morning was a total disaster. Unlike the marathon and 10K races (held the same day and time but with different starting locations), there was no bussing available to the start for half marathoners. My wife and I planned to arrive at the staging area at 5:15 a.m. The driving routes to the starting line were extremely backed up. We arrived just before 6:00 a.m. The commute that should have taken about 20 minutes took over an hour. Instead of getting my race shoes (Nike Alphafly 3) on at the staging area, I dressed hurriedly in the car. Not the ideal way to get started but I hit the porta potty (with just a modest wait) and arrived at the start with time to spare. Race organizers ultimately delayed the start time by 15 minutes. I had plenty of time to warm up, secure my race kit, and get my head right for the race. The race started without other notable surprises at 6:45 a.m.

### Race

Temperatures were in the low 50s in the morning. Cold for Arizonans but near optimal running weather in my opinion. Because of the early start and because the bulk of the course points west, I opted for a cap instead of sunglasses. I was happy with that choice. There was maybe a half mile stretch around mile 9-10 where we ran toward the sun but otherwise it was at our backs or to the side and not particularly uncomfortable. Was really a beautiful morning with excellent conditions for a run!

My plan was to go out at around 7:25 pace and slowly chip away with a trend of negative splits over the course of the race. The course is very flat and actually loses about 200 feet in elevation from start to finish. I was well aware of this and wanted to take a conservative approach to avoid going out too fast and losing steam in the latter half of the race.

There were approximately 3900 runners in the half marathon. The race advertised pacers for 1:30 and 1:40 goal times but I did not see them at the start. There were not formal corrals but there were flags marking 1:30, 1:40, 1:50 etc. There was plenty of space to line up in front of the 1:40 flag. But because there were relatively few runners in front of the 1:40 marker it was a little tough to assess the crowd with which I was set to start. I did not want to get stuck behind a slower wave but I also didn’t want to get sucked in with runners who were significantly quicker than I am. It ended up being ok. I did get pulled out slightly faster than I intended to start (around 7:00 instead of 7:25) but I was able to remain grounded and moderate. I didn’t end up being at all detrimental to the rest of my race plan.

I hydrated with sports drink at miles 4, 6, and 8 (I think). I had a few Honey Stinger gummies around mile 4. I took about half of an SiS gel at mile 7 and the rest at around mile 10.5. I felt the threat of slight GI discomfort so I opted to fuel slowly and conservatively to monitor how I was feeling. Fortunately, I made it through and averted any significant discomfort or GI crisis. (Note: There were aid stations about every other mile. Each had water and Gatorade. Several also offered Gu gels.)

The course was spacious and comfortable throughout. Not a ton of spectators but enough to infuse a steady flow of energy throughout the race. Aside from some very minor traffic at a couple aid stations, I was able to moderate my pace and stick to a plan without stride disruptions or any crowd related obstacles to navigate in the course. I did not have a large pack in my pace range to settle in with but was able to stick with a rotation of a dozen or so runners at various stages throughout the race to help gauge pace, maintain control, and stay consistent throughout. I read a few reviews that said the latter miles became a bit clogged with walkers in the 10K but, from what I observe, walkers stayed off to the side and the roadways were wide and open enough to run unencumbered throughout the race. (Note: Because the course was shared with the marathon and 10K, I thought mile markers and signage were slightly less than ideal. Not terrible but I do think a clearer system could help runners in each event track progress throughout the race.)

By mile 8 I was feeling generally good. I felt like I was in very good shape for my “C” goal and I was cautiously optimistic that my “B” goal—a new PR—was well within reach. I certainly felt some fatigue building after mile 9 or so but I was able to keep focused through mile 11 when I allowed myself to open up my stride a bit more as I pushed toward the final stretch. As I moved toward that final section of the race, I felt good physically and mentally and knew that I was on pace for a finish with which I would be quite happy. I ran my fastest splits in miles 12 and 13, and came through the finish with an emotional feeling of strength and euphoria. I crossed the finish line with a new PR, breaking the old one—which I ran in a much more youthful body over 9 years ago—by more than two minutes.

### Post-race

Hitting a new PR at age 44, in the middle of a training block, and despite some health challenges I’ve confronted in the past five years, was a huge confidence boost. I feel strong and motivated to keep moving forward toward that BQ later this year. And, yes, I am feeling proud of the discipline and commitment that has gotten me to this place. I am so grateful for my health, my mobility, and the support of my incredible wife, which have all made this running journey possible for me. 

I’d absolutely recommend this half marathon to others who might be looking for a fast course with great weather during a winter training block.

Next stop: Conway, New Hampshire!

Onward!

*‘Phweeeeee!’*

The kettle’s cry faded as I switched off the burner and removed it, tail swaying behind me. Tea leaves swirled in my mug as the water poured, steam wafting up to carry the herbal fragrance as I slowly breathed in, letting it tingle over my tongue.

I made my way through the kitchen, padding around the small aramek wood table and matching chairs, with the mug carefully cradled between my paws. The building anticipation I had been experiencing was still a bit surprising, even after nearly a half herd of paws. What at first had been a source of anxiety, initially only overcome by my own curiosity, had swiftly settled itself into routine.

At the start of nearly every last claw after closing up the shop, I made my tea, came into the den, and settled onto the sofa with my pad. The long, low table before the sofa gleamed. Spirewood, the boards cut at an angle to exaggerate the grain of the wood. The stain I had chosen was dark and rich, several shades deeper than my own wool, the waving pattern of the grain dancing over the surface like a monochrome aurora.

A soft purr escaped as I settled into my seat, the deep green sofa cushions embracing me as I curled into the corner, legs tucked beneath me and my tail curling around my knees. I’d used the same wood and stain for the frame, the gleaming dark brown wood bordering the carefully stitched and stuffed cushions, a softer shade of green thread used to stitch a pattern of leaves near the edges.

My ears flicked with humor, thinking about how Tevil would tease me for admiring my own work again. I took another scenting breath of the tea, closing my eyes and following with a slow sip, letting the aromatics soothe, and the herbal heat warm me from within. As much as I looked forward to this time every paw, there was still some lingering anxiety. Objectively, most of my interactions with my exchange partner had been good. But every now and then, she would say something confusing, worrying, or just downright frustrating.

Collecting my pad from the table, I opened the app, scrolling rapidly up through the previous Paws messages as I let the words fly past. 

>*‘I don’t know what else to tell you, Bel! That’s just how it is! Sure, it can get a little expensive when you have to buy a whole lot of materials, but, like, basic stuff is dirt cheap. I could go to the corner and get a box of markers for pocket change. I’d try to be more specific, but I have no clue what the conversion rate would even be.’*

A spark of incredulity. My craft was more utilitarian, sure, but the thought that a planet of predators would have such a disparity in the access of art and culture was… Upsetting. Even after learning that all of the new textiles on the market, as well as many other new concepts and products, originated with them. It was hard to accept at first. I scrolled further. 

>*‘OMG! Bel, please. You can’t go asking a girl things like that. At least not till after the first date.’*

Blooming frustration as I quickly swiped away. I still wasn’t sure why my question got such a bawdy answer, but I had decided not to push.

>*‘I wish this thing allowed for pictures. Your family sounds adorable. I wish I could just see all of them. I’m trying to sketch it out, but it’s a little difficult without being able to look at anything! I don’t even know if I have the spots right!’*

Embarrassment and humor. She seemed to be constantly drawing while we chatted. Always randomly asking for details of something in the middle of other conversations. She seemed entirely unable to simply sit and focus on one thing at a time. I moved up further in the chat. 

>*‘Okay, let’s get this out of the way then. I have to be… careful. The filters are apparently super harsh, and I really don’t want to fuck this up. Yes. I have had… that. But please, remember it’s all basically artificial anymore. We get it from the market! Little grown portions that most of the time don’t resemble much of anything. Neither I nor anyone I personally know goes out and… Gets Their Own. It’s just not something the average person does. Not for a long time now. Besides, I’ve already given it up! I want to make sure things are all set on my end with the supplements and stuff.’*

Queasiness, but also bafflement. A species of predators that could just… choose to not partake of flesh. Why did they do it at all if it was a choice? Obviously, it had something to do with the supplements she mentioned. I should have asked more, but I remember being too uncomfortable at that point. Another flick of the thumb, and I found myself back at the first message.

>*‘Hi, Belik! My name is Madi! I can’t even describe how exciting this is. I know that most venlil are only just now learning about humanity, after everything that occurred on The Cradle… But we’ve known about you for months! Speaking with a completely different, intelligent species is an incredible opportunity for humanity! A dream come true! We’ve been told that you guys might be a bit nervous for a while, so I just want to say, please take this at your own pace. As excited as I am, I don’t want you to force yourself to be uncomfortable just to try and match my energy. When you’re ready to talk, I’ll be here.’*

Warmth. Now anyway. I remember the sheer terror when my pad had pinged that first paw. I had only signed up at first on impulse. The reveal of humanity after the events on The Cradle. The fascinating designs on some of the textiles, which I had only recently learned originated on Terra, piqued my deep curiosity. Even so… It had taken me nearly the entire rest of the claw to even respond to her first message.

Ever since that first message, though, my paw wasn't complete until Madi and I had our chat. Now, as if she knew I was ready, the app chimed with a new notification. I instantly scrolled back down to find it.

>*‘Hey Bel! How's my favorite mountain of fluff? Did you take up any new commissions today?’*

I softly whistled in response to her playful endearment, my tail thumping lightly on the sofa.

>*‘Good paw, Madi. I'm doing very well, thank you. And no, you know I’m not taking any new jobs now. We'll be meeting soon, and I don't want to put anything on hold after all.’*  


>*‘Weeeeell, I would hate to make any assumptions. I know that the next step is pretty big. (Hehe) Us humans know we need our partners to approve us for the next phase. I get that it's not easy for a lot of you. I just want to make sure you're ready.’*

Again I felt the now-familiar warmth I always experienced when talking to her. So much empathy. She was constantly checking that I was okay with how things were going. That, more than anything, reassured me that we could go through with the next step.

>*‘Then you better make sure you're all packed up and ready! I already sent in my submission for the exchange. Approval notifications should be going out early next Paw.’*  


>*‘Really!? That's amazing! Oh, I'm so excited! I can't wait to finally see you! And show you everything that I've drawn so far. Ooooooh. I really hope I got the details right. Fuck, it would be so embarrassing if I got something super wrong.’*  


>*‘I’m sure you did fine. With the amount of information you demanded, I can't imagine they’ll be anything less than amazing.’*  


>*‘Only because I had a guy with an amazing eye for detail helping me out. Oh, I can’t wait to be able to see your own work! Please don’t forget to bring pictures!’*

I found myself chuckling again, a warm but gentle bloom spreading over my snout. We’d argued, playfully, about my work before. I certainly took pride in it, meticulously carving out the finest details in everything I made. But it was still furniture. Fancy furniture for certain, but to call it art… She refused to relent. Her insistence that we were peers in the same ‘realm of creation’ embarrassed me a little, but I would be lying if I said I hadn’t appreciated it. While she couldn't send me any pictures directly over the app, she had been able to guide me through portions of the data dump, showing me vast examples of both traditional forms of art as well as things much closer to my own work.

Chairs, sofas, and lounges, all made of gleaming, alien woods and intricately woven patterns of fabrics. Tables, shelving, cabinets, chests, and so many more carefully carved, lovingly shaped objects, molded and formed into something of beauty and function. Precious metals are inlaid into surfaces, and resins and epoxies are used to bring disparate parts into a whole, while those seemingly utilitarian bonds themselves are made into something to please the eye.

It had been inspirational. I was eager to try some of these things out. To play with these new ideas, but I held off for now. It was much more important that I actually met the human that helped to show all of those new possibilities to me.

My ears twitch up as I return to the present, focused on the pad again.

>*‘Don’t worry. I’ve got lots ready to go on the pad. Pictures of my work, of the places around Timberbrook I told you about, and of course of my family and herd!’*  


>*‘Yes! I hope I got the landscapes right. Oh wait! Is Tevil going to be okay while you’re gone? From the way you talk, you two practically live together!’*

“Speh…” I muttered, blooming a little stronger now as my ears drooped back. She was constantly going on about that.

>*‘I’ve told you we don’t actually live together, Madi. Yes, he’s my best friend, but he has his own place. He actually agreed to tend to both my indoor plants and the garden while I’m away, in fact. So not only is he going to be okay with me leaving for a while, he’s helping to support it!’*

I let out a huff, tail twitching, before taking a sip of my tea. Madi was constantly making remarks about Tevil and me for some reason. I really didn’t get the fascination. Maybe it was because he was a Sivkit? Humanity only really knew about the Venlil, Gojid, Zurulians, and the Dossur. She had asked about a bunch of different species for her sketches.

>*‘Mmm, supportive, huh? Interesting. Well, either way, I hope I can get a chance to actually meet him someday. I know we’re gonna be stuck at the special housing place or whatever, but I really hope I can see your home for real and not just through photos.’*

I found my tail thumping with a wag again. It was a little nerve-wracking to think about, but also… exciting. The thought of bringing Madi around VP, showing her Timberbrook, taking the Ring and seeing lots of other places and landmarks. Maybe even getting the chance to bring her around to Twilight to witness the Night. Tevil has also been pretty eager to learn about Madi and humans in general. I could almost imagine all of us sitting here, chatting through nearly every claw about whatever came to mind.

*I just hope I don’t freak out at the last minute…*

Shooing the thought away with a flicking of my ears, I start typing again.

>*‘I’m sure you’ll get the chance. The whole point of the exchange is to show we can all get along, right? We might have to stay at the Exchange compound for a while, but I’m sure we’ll be able to explore soon enough. And we’ll call Tevil up to meet us as soon as we can.’*

Another ping from my tablet pulled my eye away from the sketch pad. I smiled wide at Bel’s assurances. He was such a sweetie. Most of the time. My hands were filthy, fingers coated in graphite and charcoal; the only thing keeping the blank spaces on the paper clear at this point was the rag I used to clutch the board I had the sketchpad clipped onto. Thank fuck for speech to text.

“Two cute and fluffy boys escorting me around the planet?” I giggled. “Not gonna lie, Bel, that sounds like an absolute dream. I can’t wait. Send.” I paused, making sure the command went through. Once I saw the message pop up in the chat, I grinned, imagining what he might look like, flustered about my little bit of teasing.

I honestly meant everything I'd ever said to him. We had plenty of good fun now, but… It was *terrifying*. There was no way I was passing up this chance. To see an alien world, entirely new vistas, plants, animals, and *people!* To discover an entirely new sky… I just wish that the skyline wasn’t dominated by fucking giants. Emotional, easily frightened ones at that!

*Stop. Focus. Relax.*

The whole empathic thing was a hugely weird issue all on its own. I had figured I would be rejected immediately because of my ridiculous brain. But… I guess my interview and testing went better than I hoped. I’ve spent a solid number of years being hyperaware of my emotions and learning to control them. Guess that gave me an edge over most others. Whatever it was that made this possible, it was made crystal fucking clear that we were responsible for keeping even heads while abroad. 

I let out a sigh, my hand moving across the page at the same time, allowing my attention to sink back into the project in front of me. It was a tricky one. I’d drawn dozens of pictures of what I thought Belik looked like by now. The warm brown wool, the soft cream splotches he described to me over his body. I remembered laughing my ass off for a while that day.

I let my eyes wander over my own arm. The soft, coffee and cream color of my skin suddenly bleached a deathly pale in a large, messy-looking splotch before returning to normal past my elbow. It wasn’t the only place either. Not only had the program matched me with an artist, a crafts-ven even! *Pft.* But we matched in appearance too? It was wild. Someone running the program had a fucking sense of humor, and I respected it.

I shifted the angle of the massive clipboard I was using to hold the pad in place. Upon the paper was the image I had in my mind of Bel. Thick, slightly curly fur. A long, strong, but slender tail. Paws with four flexible digits, resting on peculiarly knocked knees as he crouched down. His feet spread wide, large and sinking slightly into the dirt. He was looking down, head tilted to the side to get a better look with one large eye. The pupil is a wide, rounded rectangle. The wool around his head and throat was thicker, with larger and looser curls spilling over his shoulders and down his chest. Ridiculously adorable, bunny-like ears stick out from the thick wool on his head, one of them up and forward, focused on whatever he was staring at, while the other cocked slightly to the side, showing his curiosity. All of this from a slightly off, low perspective.

It was what I imagined I would see once we finally met. This huge, adorable, *dangerous* creature, crouching down to inspect me. Goosebumps rippled down my body, just thinking about it. As long as I kept my head, though… It was a good kind of fear. The tense kind of anticipation while you're in line for a roller coaster. The way it grew over time. Constantly building as you got your seat, strapped in, and began making that slow climb.

I was terrified. Thrilled. Excited. Eager. I just had to remember… The Dossur have been a part of the federation for a long time themselves. Despite what felt like an egregious lack of accommodations, the other species were used to them being around. It’s not like they got stepped on constantly or something… right? No. That would be ridiculous. And I trusted Bel. Once we were together, I was certain he’d keep an eye out for me. ~~Or at least keep an eye on the predator.~~ *‘Mmmm, nope. Don’t start that.’* He had gotten over that crap quickly. It only took a few days and a few more awkward questions before he seemed to get past that nonsense.

I ran my fingers over the page, rubbing through the pencil marks, using them to soften edges, change the curve of a shadow there, and alter the way the fur settled here…

Ping! I grinned again before looking. I must have gotten him really good with the last one. It took him nearly five minutes to respond.

>*‘Why are you like this? You know what? Sure. Whatever you say. We’ll make sure you get the full guided tour.’* 

I could almost hear the sarcasm and exasperation. Ahhh… Satisfaction.

Ping! Wait… I’m still staring at his last message. There’s nothing new; what was that ping for? “Fuck’s sake.” I growled under my breath, putting aside my… admittedly finished work, and attempted to wipe my hands clean with the rag. Once I was satisfied I wouldn't get pencil smudges all over the tablet’s case, I swiped out of the app and over to my notifications. “...Oh.”

I quickly switched back to Bel, anxiety and anticipation warring with one another as I typed out another message.

>*‘I guess they’re eager to get things going, Bel, cause I just got my confirmation for the next phase of the program. Guess I’ll be seeing you for real in just two days!’*

On February 10th Noah went live in a coffee shop at 11:00am.

Several interesting thoughts during this live stream and I will attempt to follow this story in chronological order, however with him answering comments and his already unclear thought process this is difficult. 

Noah when asked by a fan about the next “move” has said that he plans on selling his car today. This deal hinges on an unknown offer to an unknown person. He plans on putting the money into “real estate”. He is very unclear on what that could mean. He said that buying real estate is “simple enough”. 

Noah stated that he has not made any advances in his Job search. He has submitted zero applications thus far.

Noah has said he will be needing a fast car “asap”. During this live Noah has also stated that he will be going to Germany to Porsche Headquarters “probably this year” to get a car. Around this time Noah stepped outside of the coffee shop to smoke a cig. That was around five minutes into his live.

 “Drinking Gasoline gets you going. Really puts he petal to the medal in other words”.  This is a direct quote from Noah that I really enjoyed. 

Noah has also stated that he people should be getting ahead of crypto before the “feds get involved”. He did not comment on this any further.

Noah also displayed his knowledge in the field of history today when discussing the gold standard. America stopped using the Gold standard under president Nixon in 1971. Noah said that the United States stopped using the Gold Standard in either 1971 or 1961. Pretty close. 

Noah then went on to say that Bitcoin is not all that great. He received this information from some “Programers”. 

He has said is doing a real estate license course that he has already partially taken. He then free-styled a couple bars then went into the following comments that are direct quotes said at 11:27. 

“I think the media is completely owned by Jews”

“They (the Jews) are promoting a softer Christianity than what needs to be pushed”

“They (the Jews) are attacking the household of traditionalism. Which I think is the worst of the worst”

Listen, I understand how that title sounds, but there’s no typo. English is my first language, and I didn’t miss any words. I couldn't present my current circumstances any more literally, and I’ve struggled with figuring out the best place to start. I suppose this is as good as any other, so bear with me. 

Five days ago, I discovered an attic below my cellar.

I grew up here, secluded on the top of a hill, no neighbors as far as the eye can see. On starless nights, I vividly remember this farmhouse casting a dim light across the surrounding woodland like the lone candle flickering atop a first birthday cake. Its two stories had more rooms than the three of us, my parents and I, knew what to do with. The excessive space was the only extravagance, though. Otherwise, the house wasn’t much more than a porch, a gabled roof, and a musty, unfurnished cellar with a bunch of empty rooms sandwiched in between.

The property has been in my deadbeat of a father’s family for generations. When he stepped out on us, ownership passed on to my mother. She died in her sleep three months ago, so now it’s mine.

All of which is to say - I’d stepped over that space in the cellar hundreds of times over the course of my life, but I’d never seen that small wooden hatch until this week. Or, maybe more accurately, I’d never *perceived* it until this week.

When I pulled the rope to open the hatch, finally at my wit’s end with the whole of it - the constant whistling, the screeching violin, the ungodly “*angel*” - I couldn’t comprehend what I was looking at. It took me a while to wrap my mind around the mechanics. Once it clicked, though, the magnitude of the impossible contradiction lit my spine on fire.

Through the hatch, I saw the ceiling of an attic I didn’t recognize. Although it was the middle of the night where I was, it was daytime in the room beneath me. I could tell by the pure blue sky and the sunlight streaming from the open window in one of its corners.

I’m getting slightly ahead of myself, though.

Life is such a maddeningly complex phenomenon, and yet, your brain will try to convince you it’s all relatively straightforward. What you see in front of you is what’s there, full stop. No room for nuance, no space for intricacy. It is what it is.

My dad, the self-proclaimed clairvoyant, taught me otherwise. He’d say things like:

*""Reality is a painting that spreads on forever, in every direction. Perception is the frame; everyone and everything is born with a different frame. Some are bigger, some are smaller. Your experience in this life is only what lives in that frame, but don’t let that mislead you.""*

*""It’s a grain of sand, not the whole beach.""*

As much as I despise the man, I have to admit that he could dispense some wisdom when the mood suited him. Science has only progressed to prove him correct, as well. Take the mantis shrimp, for example. Unassuming little crustaceans that, somehow, can perceive twelve separate wavelengths of color, staggering in comparison to our measly three (red, green and blue). Their frame of perception captures a piece of reality distinct from our own, illustrating that just because we can’t see those nine additional colors, doesn’t mean they aren’t there.

Maybe I wouldn’t have spent my twenties homeless on the streets of Chicago if he stayed around long enough to impart his entire sagely portfolio, rather than just a few breadcrumbs here and there.

I'd be remised if I didn't mention that he’d say all this one minute, acting like a paragon of philosophical thought, and then loudly complain that he was being stalked by biblically accurate angels the next. I have multiple memories of him telling my mother through urgent whispers that they were watching his every move. Balls of eyes like a pile of burning coals lurking in all the empty spaces of our home, staring at him.

The man was unhinged.

When my mother wasn't around, he’d ask me if I could see them as well. Told me that most of the men in our bloodline can *“massage the veil”,* whatever the fuck that means. He'd go on to explain that, if I *should happen* to peer in between the layers of reality, I shouldn’t be afraid, but I should be careful. Standing above me, his pupils wide and black like falling meteors in the night sky, he’d warn me of the so-called dangers.

*The more you look, the more you’ll see. The more things that you can see, the more things that can see you back.*

I think I was seven when he first said that. You want to know how to instill crippling anxiety in a child? Fear so debilitating that it manifests as wild, unchecked alcoholism once it’s given the opportunity? This is a great recipe.

Until the hatch in the cellar, never saw a goddamned thing that shouldn’t logically be there, despite my deeply ingrained fears. Heard some things, though. Somber, wordless lullabies from somewhere deep inside a broom closet, the pitch of the voice wavering abruptly between a little too high and a little too low. The notes of a pipe organ falling gently from my bedroom ceiling like raindrops. Lyrics sung to me by a child I couldn't see in a language I didn't understand.

Naturally, I took my dad’s advice - pretended like I couldn't hear the phantom noises. For the most part, he turned out to be right. That tactic kept a lid on things.

Moving back into my childhood home was a mistake, but it was a steady roof over my head for the first time in years, and my mom needed the help. For the six months that I was taking care of her, the house was quiet. As soon as she passed, though, the ethereal clamor returned at a peak intensity.

I had no more distractions, I guess.

\-------------

The night after the funeral, I was sitting on the porch, absorbed in a moment of bitter tranquility as I listened to the quiet chatter coming from the forest. I sipped warm decaffeinated coffee, doing my damndest to avoid thinking about how much more comforting a tumbler of whiskey would be. The sound of a melody interrupted that internal conflict, cutting through the tuneless humming of insects.

The noise was shrill, oddly familiar, and it wasn’t coming from the wilderness. It was someone whistling and they were behind me, projecting the melody from somewhere within the house.

I sprang from my rocking chair to face the disembodied sound drifting through the open door. The act of me jumping up made a lot of noise; the feet of the chair creaking, the thump of my boots slamming against the floorboards. But the whistling didn’t react. It didn’t slow or stop. The melody kept on, eerily unphased by the abrupt calamity.

As I stood in front of the doorway, terror galloped through me, shaking my body like the thrums of an earthquake. Eventually, adrenaline converted fear into anger, and anger always comes packaged with a bit dumb courage. I grabbed a baseball bat from my mom’s old truck and proceeded to do laps through the hallways of my childhood home with a teetering look of confidence.

As I stomped from room to room, the melody ringing in my ears, salty tears unexpectedly welled up under my eyes. The airy refrain was just so familiar, but I still couldn't discern *why* it was familiar.

Tracking the sound to its origin put me in front of the hatch for the first time.

It wasn’t more than a few steps from the bottom of the stairs. I rounded the corner, pulled the metal drawstring that turned on the cellar’s dusty light bulb, and there it was. Positioned in the middle of the basement, an oaken trapdoor with a frayed rope attached, emitting the muffled whistling like it was a buried jukebox.

In the blink of an eye, I felt my bravery evaporate, released in tandem with the copious sweat that was now dripping from every inch of my body.

My mom needed supplemental oxygen in the last few months of her life, and this is where we kept the tanks, right over the space that the hatch now occupied. It had been nothing but dirt the day before.

I stared at the closed passageway from the safety of the cellar landing, but I did not dare approach. Not that night, at least. Instead, I let the baseball bat fall limply from my hand, turned around, and walked back up the stairs.

Numbed to the point of indifference, I continued another flight of stairs up to my bedroom, and I immediately crumbled onto my mattress.

Five days ago, utter exhaustion allowed rest to come easily.

Since then, however, sleep has evaded me completely.

\-------------

The whistling wasn't some bizarre manifestation of grief that would vanish once I woke up, like I had hoped that first night.

When my eyes fluttered open, it was still there, faint but consistent like the ticking of a grandfather clock.

My boss at the nearby grocery store sounded worried when I called him, requesting to be placed back on the schedule for the week. Originally, I had taken bereavement leave through the end of the month. After the whistling started, though, I would have done anything to occupy myself outside the house. With fifty dollars in my savings account, I had little options, and I was desperate not to find myself slapping those fifty dollars against the surface of a bar top. Eventually, he relented.

At first, time away from the incessant whistling helped. Three days in, though, the melody turned out to be quite the earworm. It rang in my head like church bells, reverberating endlessly against acoustic bone but never actually dissipating, no matter how much time I spent away from it.

\-------------

Yesterday, I was standing over the stovetop in my kitchen, forcing undercooked scrambled eggs down my throat as quickly as its muscles would allow me so I could leave for work. Retching from the revolting texture, I placed the ceramic plate down on the tile countertop with more power than I intended. As a result, a loud *clatter* exploded through the room. Briefly, I couldn’t hear the whistling over the sound. When the plate stilled, the air had finally stilled, too.

Pure, unabated silence filled my ears. A tremendous wave of relief flooded through my chest. From where I stood, the cellar door was directly behind me. Before I could really savor the relief, that door creaked open, the splintered wood present on the bottom dragging harshly against its frame.

Reflexively, I spun around.

The door was newly ajar, but nothing and no one was there.

Heart thumping and wide eyed, I waited in the silence, trying to seduce thick air into my lungs as I watched for whatever had opened the door to finally appear.

I stared at the space, breathless, and yet still nothing came. Until I blinked, that is, and then it was just…it was just there. When my eyelids opened, it had materialized in the entryway, motionless and grotesque beyond comprehension.

A wheel of charcoal flesh, approximately six feet tall and two feet wide, held up by three hands protruding from its base. The wheel itself was littered with eyes. Thousands of frost-white, sickly looking orbs of differing sizes with no irises or pupils. Some blinked rapidly; inhumanly quick like the shutter of a camera lens. Others stayed open, their focus placed solely on me with indecipherable intent. The hands grew out of a central stump, sprouting haphazardly from the wheel with no sense of design or forethought. They were like rampaging tumors, expanding aimlessly while also fighting for space and control. The largest was in the back, supporting the fleshy construct with a half-crescent of muscular fingers, at least thirty in total, if not more. Two smaller, weaker hands jutted out the front. They were nearly twins, but the appendages had slight differences in their knuckle placement and their overall brawn.

Unable to remain unblinking indefinitely, my eyes eventually closed. I instantly forced them back open, expecting that the wheel would have moved to pounce in the time I wasn’t watching it. Instead, it had vanished. Or worse, it was still there, staring at me from a thousand distinct vantages, but I simply wasn’t perceiving it anymore.

I tried to convince myself that I was just losing my mind. Hallucinations from a grief-stricken, maladapted, alcohol-deprived brain. The ""*angel's""* departure left something behind, however, which confirmed to me its ungodly existence.

When I stepped towards the cellar door, I noticed a trail of black ash that led down the stairs and across the dirt floor. Of course, I would later find that the trail ended right at the edge of the hatch. I bent over and rubbed some of it between my fingers. The ash was thin like soot, but it was inexplicably cold, to the point where it felt like I was developing frostbite.

As I rinsed the dust off in the sink, my panic quickly rising from the biting pain, the whistling abruptly resumed, now accompanied by the harsh screeches of what sounded like a violin.

\-------------

Over the next day, sometimes the violin mirrored the melody, and sometimes it played the melody with a slight delay, lagging chaotically behind the whistle’s reliable tempo. No matter what it did, the unseen instrument was brutally out of tune. The discord was like a cheese grater sliding against my brain, shredding flecks of my sanity off with every drag.

I would wager I slept for no longer than an hour last night, restlessly watching for the return of the black wheel. As far as I could tell, though, it never came.

When dawn spilled through my bedroom window, however, I noticed something that turned my blood into sleet.

There was a silhouette made of the ash above my bed in the wheel's shape. No idea when it got there or why I was just noticing it then. My eyes followed the ash as it curved along the wall, down onto the floor, under my locked bedroom door, eventually leading all the way back to the hatch. Maybe it crawled up here in the brief moments I was asleep, but I think the more likely explanation is that lingered above my bed while I was still awake, present but imperceptible.

Half a day later, I would cautiously push my head through the open hatch, seeing for myself what existence looked like on the other side.

I’m not expecting you to understand why I didn’t run.

All I can say is, overtime, the melody beckoned me through the threshold.

\-------------

Four hours ago, I anchored myself to the cellar by a rope tied to my waist and the foot of a nearby water heater. Like I said at the top of this post, although night had fallen outside, it was the middle of the day in the attic when I pulled the hatch open. Oddly, the whistling had become fairly quiet, and the discordant violin had disappeared entirely. The notes of the whistling were clearer, but overall, the melody was softer.

Driven by a magnetism I couldn’t possibly understand at that moment, I lowered my head and my shoulders into the passageway.

The experience fucked up my internal equilibrium in ways that I can’t find the right words to describe. I was putting my body down, but as my eyes peered over the attic floor, my head felt like it was going up. Fighting through pangs of practically existential nausea, I slowly continued to lower myself in.

Collar bone deep, I could view most of the attic. To my surprise, there wasn’t anything obviously otherworldly. The room itself was pretty barren, nothing but a desk and a sewing machine pushed against the wall opposite to me with a large window above it. I perked my ears, trying to localize the exact point of origin for the whistling. Before I could find it, however, a child unexpectedly walked by my head from behind me, causing a yelp to leap from my vocal cords. Instinctively, I pulled my body out of the hole.

Anxiously kneeling next to the open hatch, I waited to hear some response to my outcry - a scream, a distress call to a nearby parent, something to indicate that I had been heard. Unexpectedly, all was quiet on the other side. There was some faint rustling of drawers, and the whistling continued, but otherwise, both worlds were still.

Now trembling, I once again lowered my head into the hatch.

The child, who couldn’t have been more than five years old, was sitting at the desk, kicking their legs and coloring. She looked…normal, certainly wasn’t the black wheel of blinking flesh that had invaded my home the day before.

*Just find what the fuck is making the whistling,* I reminded myself.

In the cellar, I moved my knees around the perimeter of the hatch, which slowly spun my head around to the part of the attic I hadn’t yet seen. When I turned, there was an old wardrobe and a few pieces of furniture covered by a dusty see-through tarp, but nothing more than that.

Suddenly, I heard the squeak of the child pushing her chair out from her desk behind me.

There was a pause, and then they called out in a voice three octaves too low for their size:

*“Is…is anyone there?”*

When I turned back, the child was facing me. They stared at me but through me, as if they sensed my presence but didn’t see my physical form.

I failed to choke back a scream, but when it escaped my lips, they didn’t react to it.

Their facial texture was horribly distorted, uneven and bubbling from chin to hairline. Both eyes were on their right side, one on their forehead and one where their cheekbone should be. I could appreciate nearly the entire curve of the higher eye as it bulged outward, while the other eye was reciprocally sunken, showing only the tip of a pupil peeking out from caving skin. Their mouth carved a diagonal line across the face, severing their visage into two equal, triangular spaces.

They asked again, slower and somehow even deeper this time around, causing their face to practically bloom into a sea of red, pulsating tissue as their diagonal maw spread wide.

*“Iiiiisssss aaaaanyone tttthere?”*

All of a sudden, the whistling’s volume became deafening, like it was being sung into my ear from a mere few inches away. At the same time, it was the clearest I'd heard it up until that point. In a moment of horrific realization, I remembered why I knew that godforsaken collection of notes.

It was the lead melody from *Etude Op.2 No.1* by Alexander Scriabin, my father’s favorite piece of music, and it wasn't coming from anywhere around me.

It was coming from above me.

When I looked up, I saw the black wheel, hanging motionless from the rafters by its three hands like a sleeping bat. It was so close that my face nearly made contact with its flesh as I tilted my neck.

In an explosion of movement, I wrenched my body out of the attic and slammed the hatch down to close the passageway. Through raspy breaths, I sprinted around the basement, pulling boxes and other items on top of the hatch. In less than a minute, there was a mound of random objects stacked on top of the obscene doorway. Feverishly, I inspected the barrier, but it still didn’t feel like enough. Scanning the cellar for additional weight, I saw a particularly hefty trunk all the way on the other end of the room. When I darted over to grab it, I was yanked face first onto the hard dirt, momentum halted by the rope that still connected my torso to the water heater. Moaning on the ground, my abdomen burned from the squeeze and my nose, no doubt broken from the fall, leaked warm blood down the back of my throat.

The searing pains caused my mania to slow, and I sluggishly turned over onto my back to untie the rope from my waist. As I did, my eyes scanned the cellar.

I couldn’t see the black wheel around me, but I could still hear the whistling. It was distant, but it was still there. Not only that, but the notes, although faint, seemed to have a bit more energy to them. Like below the hatch, the wheel was excited. Overjoyed, even.

Moments later, the melody ceased. I was skeptical at first, believing it was just another tiny intermission, but it went silent for hours. The hatch was still there, too.

And in the silence that followed, I feel like I finally understood the message that the whistling was attempting to deliver to me.

*“Hey son - I’m down here.”*

*“I may look a little different, but I'm still your father.”*

*“Now, are you ready to join me?""*

\-------------

Decades ago, it seems that my father slipped through a break in reality and ended up somewhere else. Can't tell if that was a voluntary or involuntarily decision on his end, but I theorize he spent so much time out of his natural position that he began to undergo changes. Became one those ""*angels*"" that only he could see from my childhood.

The implication being that those ""*angels*"" were people from other places that somehow became stuck in *our* piece of existence, I guess.

Unfortunately, I'm now able to perceive the hole my father disappeared down all those years ago. The optimistic side of me wants to believe the fracture is bound to my childhood home, so burning it down and having it cave in on itself may actually plug the cosmic leak. The pessimistic side of me, on the other hand, recognizes it probably isn’t that simple. And that side has some new evidence to bolster their argument, as well.

It’s just like my dad said:

*The more you look, the more you’ll see. The more things that you can see, the more things that can see you back.*

As I’m sitting in my mom’s truck with a cannister of gasoline and a box of matches, typing this all up on my weathered iPhone, I’m hearing things in the woods.

In front of me, a deep, unearthly voice is humming a new lullaby from within the dark canopy. Behind me, from the black depths of my childhood home, I've begun to hear the whistling again. Minute by minute, both seem to only be getting closer.

Is there any point in burning this place to the ground before I go?

Or now that I can fully perceive the melodies and the wheel of blinking flesh that my father has become, is there any point in running at all? Where can you even hide from that sort of thing?

I...I just don't know.

Yesterday, I was standing over the stovetop in my kitchen, forcing undercooked scrambled eggs down my throat as quickly as its muscles would allow me so I could leave for work. Retching from the revolting texture, I placed the ceramic plate down on the tile countertop with more power than I intended. As a result, a loud *clatter* exploded through the room. Briefly, I couldn’t hear the whistling over the sound. When the plate stilled, the air had finally stilled, too.

Pure, unabated silence filled my ears. A tremendous wave of relief flooded through my chest. From where I stood, the cellar door was directly behind me. Before I could really savor the relief, that door creaked open, the splintered wood present on the bottom dragging harshly against its frame.

Reflexively, I spun around.

The door was newly ajar, but nothing and no one was there.

Heart thumping and wide eyed, I waited in the silence, trying to seduce thick air into my lungs as I watched for whatever had opened the door to finally appear.

I stared at the space, breathless, and yet still nothing came. Until I blinked, that is, and then it was just…it was just there. When my eyelids opened, it had materialized in the entryway, motionless and grotesque beyond comprehension.

A wheel of charcoal flesh, approximately six feet tall and two feet wide, held up by three hands protruding from its base. The wheel itself was littered with eyes. Thousands of frost-white, sickly looking orbs of differing sizes with no irises or pupils. Some blinked rapidly; inhumanly quick like the shutter of a camera lens. Others stayed open, their focus placed solely on me with indecipherable intent. The hands grew out of a central stump, sprouting haphazardly from the wheel with no sense of design or forethought. They were like rampaging tumors, expanding aimlessly while also fighting for space and control. The largest was in the back, supporting the fleshy construct with a half-crescent of muscular fingers, at least thirty in total, if not more. Two smaller, weaker hands jutted out the front. They were nearly twins, but the appendages had slight differences in their knuckle placement and their overall brawn.

Unable to remain unblinking indefinitely, my eyes eventually closed. I instantly forced them back open, expecting that the wheel would have moved to pounce in the time I wasn’t watching it. Instead, it had vanished. Or worse, it was still there, staring at me from a thousand distinct vantages, but I simply wasn’t perceiving it anymore.

I tried to convince myself that I was just losing my mind. Hallucinations from a grief-stricken, maladapted, alcohol-deprived brain. The ""*angel's""* departure left something behind, however, which confirmed to me its ungodly existence.

When I stepped towards the cellar door, I noticed a trail of black ash that led down the stairs and across the dirt floor. Of course, I would later find that the trail ended right at the edge of the hatch. I bent over and rubbed some of it between my fingers. The ash was thin like soot, but it was inexplicably cold, to the point where it felt like I was developing frostbite.

As I rinsed the dust off in the sink, my panic quickly rising from the biting pain, the whistling abruptly resumed, now accompanied by the harsh screeches of what sounded like a violin.

\-------------

Over the next day, sometimes the violin mirrored the melody, and sometimes it played the melody with a slight delay, lagging chaotically behind the whistle’s reliable tempo. No matter what it did, the unseen instrument was brutally out of tune. The discord was like a cheese grater sliding against my brain, shredding flecks of my sanity off with every drag.

I would wager I slept for no longer than an hour last night, restlessly watching for the return of the black wheel. As far as I could tell, though, it never came.

When dawn spilled through my bedroom window, however, I noticed something that turned my blood into sleet.

There was a silhouette made of the ash above my bed in the wheel's shape. No idea when it got there or why I was just noticing it then. My eyes followed the ash as it curved along the wall, down onto the floor, under my locked bedroom door, eventually leading all the way back to the hatch. Maybe it crawled up here in the brief moments I was asleep, but I think the more likely explanation is that lingered above my bed while I was still awake, present but imperceptible.

Half a day later, I would cautiously push my head through the open hatch, seeing for myself what existence looked like on the other side.

I’m not expecting you to understand why I didn’t run.

All I can say is, overtime, the melody beckoned me through the threshold.

\-------------

Four hours ago, I anchored myself to the cellar by a rope tied to my waist and the foot of a nearby water heater. Like I said at the top of this post, although night had fallen outside, it was the middle of the day in the attic when I pulled the hatch open. Oddly, the whistling had become fairly quiet, and the discordant violin had disappeared entirely. The notes of the whistling were clearer, but overall, the melody was softer.

Driven by a magnetism I couldn’t possibly understand at that moment, I lowered my head and my shoulders into the passageway.

The experience fucked up my internal equilibrium in ways that I can’t find the right words to describe. I was putting my body down, but as my eyes peered over the attic floor, my head felt like it was going up. Fighting through pangs of practically existential nausea, I slowly continued to lower myself in.

Collar bone deep, I could view most of the attic. To my surprise, there wasn’t anything obviously otherworldly. The room itself was pretty barren, nothing but a desk and a sewing machine pushed against the wall opposite to me with a large window above it. I perked my ears, trying to localize the exact point of origin for the whistling. Before I could find it, however, a child unexpectedly walked by my head from behind me, causing a yelp to leap from my vocal cords. Instinctively, I pulled my body out of the hole.

Anxiously kneeling next to the open hatch, I waited to hear some response to my outcry - a scream, a distress call to a nearby parent, something to indicate that I had been heard. Unexpectedly, all was quiet on the other side. There was some faint rustling of drawers, and the whistling continued, but otherwise, both worlds were still.

Now trembling, I once again lowered my head into the hatch.

The child, who couldn’t have been more than five years old, was sitting at the desk, kicking their legs and coloring. She looked…normal, certainly wasn’t the black wheel of blinking flesh that had invaded my home the day before.

*Just find what the fuck is making the whistling,* I reminded myself.

In the cellar, I moved my knees around the perimeter of the hatch, which slowly spun my head around to the part of the attic I hadn’t yet seen. When I turned, there was an old wardrobe and a few pieces of furniture covered by a dusty see-through tarp, but nothing more than that.

Suddenly, I heard the squeak of the child pushing her chair out from her desk behind me.

There was a pause, and then they called out in a voice three octaves too low for their size:

*“Is…is anyone there?”*

When I turned back, the child was facing me. They stared at me but through me, as if they sensed my presence but didn’t see my physical form.

I failed to choke back a scream, but when it escaped my lips, they didn’t react to it.

Their facial texture was horribly distorted, uneven and bubbling from chin to hairline. Both eyes were on their right side, one on their forehead and one where their cheekbone should be. I could appreciate nearly the entire curve of the higher eye as it bulged outward, while the other eye was reciprocally sunken, showing only the tip of a pupil peeking out from caving skin. Their mouth carved a diagonal line across the face, severing their visage into two equal, triangular spaces.

They asked again, slower and somehow even deeper this time around, causing their face to practically bloom into a sea of red, pulsating tissue as their diagonal maw spread wide.

*“Iiiiisssss aaaaanyone tttthere?”*

All of a sudden, the whistling’s volume became deafening, like it was being sung into my ear from a mere few inches away. At the same time, it was the clearest I'd heard it up until that point. In a moment of horrific realization, I remembered why I knew that godforsaken collection of notes.

It was the lead melody from *Etude Op.2 No.1* by Alexander Scriabin, my father’s favorite piece of music, and it wasn't coming from anywhere around me.

It was coming from above me.

When I looked up, I saw the black wheel, hanging motionless from the rafters by its three hands like a sleeping bat. It was so close that my face nearly made contact with its flesh as I tilted my neck.

In an explosion of movement, I wrenched my body out of the attic and slammed the hatch down to close the passageway. Through raspy breaths, I sprinted around the basement, pulling boxes and other items on top of the hatch. In less than a minute, there was a mound of random objects stacked on top of the obscene doorway. Feverishly, I inspected the barrier, but it still didn’t feel like enough. Scanning the cellar for additional weight, I saw a particularly hefty trunk all the way on the other end of the room. When I darted over to grab it, I was yanked face first onto the hard dirt, momentum halted by the rope that still connected my torso to the water heater. Moaning on the ground, my abdomen burned from the squeeze and my nose, no doubt broken from the fall, leaked warm blood down the back of my throat.

The searing pains caused my mania to slow, and I sluggishly turned over onto my back to untie the rope from my waist. As I did, my eyes scanned the cellar.

I couldn’t see the black wheel around me, but I could still hear the whistling. It was distant, but it was still there. Not only that, but the notes, although faint, seemed to have a bit more energy to them. Like below the hatch, the wheel was excited. Overjoyed, even.

Moments later, the melody ceased. I was skeptical at first, believing it was just another tiny intermission, but it went silent for hours. The hatch was still there, too.

And in the silence that followed, I feel like I finally understood the message that the whistling was attempting to deliver to me.

*“Hey son - I’m down here.”*

*“I may look a little different, but I'm still your father.”*

*“Now, are you ready to join me?""*

\-------------

Decades ago, it seems that my father slipped through a break in reality and ended up somewhere else. Can't tell if that was a voluntary or involuntarily decision on his end, but I theorize he spent so much time out of his natural position that he began to undergo changes. Became one those ""*angels*"" that only he could see from my childhood.

The implication being that those ""*angels*"" were people from other places that somehow became stuck in *our* piece of existence, I guess.

Unfortunately, I'm now able to perceive the hole my father disappeared down all those years ago. The optimistic side of me wants to believe the fracture is bound to my childhood home, so burning it down and having it cave in on itself may actually plug the cosmic leak. The pessimistic side of me, on the other hand, recognizes it probably isn’t that simple. And that side has some new evidence to bolster their argument, as well.

It’s just like my dad said:

*The more you look, the more you’ll see. The more things that you can see, the more things that can see you back.*

As I’m sitting in my mom’s truck with a cannister of gasoline and a box of matches, typing this all up on my weathered iPhone, I’m hearing things in the woods.

In front of me, a deep, unearthly voice is humming a new lullaby from within the dark canopy. Behind me, from the black depths of my childhood home, I've begun to hear the whistling again. Minute by minute, both seem to only be getting closer.

Is there any point in burning this place to the ground before I go?

Or now that I can fully perceive the melodies and the wheel of blinking flesh that my father has become, is there any point in running at all? Where can you even hide from that sort of thing?

I...I just don't know.

1immbok,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1immbok/sf_the_social_worker/,[SF] The Social Worker,"I love my job, I truly do.  Initial assessments were tough enough for a normal social worker but, for us, it was a bit trickier.  You never new exactly what kind of person you were going to find in a house.  Last week I met a woman named Joan McFadden for the first time and it was a pretty typical encounter.  Sweet lady.  She lived in very rural northern California, out amongst the farms and ranches.  

  

The dirt road across her property was long and she surely saw the dust cloud as my car approached.  It’s always interesting walking up to one of their houses.  If you knew what you were looking for, you could always tell that the tastes of the person inside were influenced by more than recent fads.  An old chair, the out of fashion colors, just a general anachronistic feeling about the entire place.  This house was no different, those macrame plant hangers weren’t “faux retro” and those lamps were definitely pre-war.  Looking at the length of the vines, the plants look to have been growing since the 80s.  The house was well kept but outdated from several different eras and built in the style of houses during America’s westward expansion.  They always lived far away from people unless they were moving around a lot.  This old house was 2 miles from the highway on 40 acres of what used to be ranchland.  

  

I walked up the front steps of the little house, carefully stepping over an old hound snoozing on the porch   Most of these people didn’t have pets.  I think there comes a point where you just can’t bear to see another loved one die.  

  

The woman who opened the door had a dour “if this is a sales visit” look on her face.  She looked like she was in her mid-40s, shorter than today’s average height, and fit.  They are always fit.  I’m not sure if that’s related to their genes or, at some point, you just start taking care of yourself better care of yourself.  She was actually quite attractive and I idly wondered exactly where she came from.  Maybe I’d find out, maybe I’d be kicked to the curb in a few seconds.  You never knew.  

  

I put on my dopiest all-American white guy face and said, “Good morning ma’am, I’m Special Agent Martin Schwek with the FBI.  Are you Sandra Wertheimer?”   

  

Her face changed at the mention of the Bureau, “what is this about?”    

  

“May I come in for a moment?” I asked, “nothing too serious, I just need to check on some things for an investigation.”   

  

“What … what are you investigating?” the woman stammered.  

“It’s complicated and would be easier to discuss inside.” I said, trying not to be too forceful but I needed to take the option of her slamming the door in my face off the table.  

“Can I see some ID?”, the woman asked.  

I brought out my badge and, then separately, drew out my driver’s license.  I wanted her to trust me as much as possible.  

“If I were to call the FBI field office and ask them to connect to you, would they be able to do it?” she asked handing me back the cards. 

*Smart. But also paranoid.  The usual.*

I smiled showing I understood, “Yes, ma’am, they would.”

She tilted her head and head and quickly shrugged.  “Come on in then, have a seat on the sofa.” 

I walked in and quickly surveyed the tiny living room and attached kitchen.  More anachronisms, practically everywhere.  I was sure if I looked closely at some of the black and white photographs on the wall, I’d see someone who looked a lot like the woman with whom I was speaking.  Most of the time these people’s houses had a musty dirty smell.  This house was light and airy and, had it not been for the dishes that were clearly bought some time in the 1960s resting in the dish holder from the 1950s, could pass for any normal healthy 40 year old single woman’s home.

She gestured to the sofa.  “Something to drink? Water?”  They were always so polite compared to most people today.

I sat. “I’m fine, thank you.” I said nodding my head for her to sit in the leather recliner that had molded itself to her body shape.  Arts and crafts style, very nice.

She gathered her skirt, sat, and directly ask, “What is this about?”

I pulled the file out of my satchel and crossed my legs.  I always like to slow this part down.  If I go too quickly, they will brush me off and shut me out.  They may even try to flee as soon as I leave.  This needs to be a conversation and I cannot let her just rely on the lies she’s been telling for so long.

“Sandra, right?” I asked, “You never actually confirmed”

She nodded, “Ya, that’s me.  What is going on?”

“Sandra,” I paused, “How long have you lived in this house?”

She relaxed, thinking I was there about the property. “Oh, I bought it from my aunt about 20 years ago,” she lied as easy as breathing.

I opened the file and glanced at my summary, “Your aunt, Kathryn.”

“How did you…” she stopped, “What is this about?” she asked more firmly.

I needed to be careful here.  She was going to shut down if I pushed this too quickly but, at the same time, there wasn’t much point in dragging it out.  This is where we start the game of “does he know that I know that he knows?”

I decided to back up a little.  “I work for a special division of the FBI.  We help certain people who have, uh, unusual circumstances.” I paused but there was no outward reaction. “There’s no law being broken, here, it’s just a matter of keeping you safe.”  I spoke slowly and calmly, people like her did not being rushed.  Sometimes the euphemisms were enough, sometimes not.

I decided to let silence do the work at this point.  I could see the first stages “does he know…” getting moving in earnest.  She seemed to be having an internal discussion, trying to debate what I could know and what I couldn’t possibly know.  What other “unusual circumstances” could I mean? The pause stretched as we looked at each other.  I could hear the hound shift positions on the porch and the tinkling of wind chimes at the back of the house.  The sound of a clock ticking.  *I bet that clock is worth more than my yearly salary.*

“Unusual circumstances?” she asked, tilting her head.  She wasn’t a very good actor.  Most of the people like her were just normal people, they weren’t used to being questioned.

I weighed my options and decided to just go for it.  After another pause (they really like slow conversations) I softly asked, “how old are you?” leaning my head forward as if sharing a secret.

She froze for a fraction of second and then relaxed and casually said, “I’m 42.  And it’s not polite to ask a lady’s age.” The anachronisms weren’t just limited to décor.  She was going to make this difficult.

I looked down at the floor and then opened the file again.  “You know, faking a birth certificate isn’t as easy as it used to be, what with the internet and computers and all.  Used to be you could just pick a hospital that had closed down and say the records were lost.  These days, it’s not that simple, is it?”

I could see her pupils constrict.  She was well into the second phase of “what does he know” now.

“I wouldn’t know,” she said flatly.

“The thing is,” I continued, “St. Mary’s in Chicago was an early adopter of computer records.  Going back to the late 1970s, actually  Very forward thinking on their part.”  I raised my head and looked her in the eyes.

“I didn’t know that,” she said tripping over the words a little.

“Even though the hospital records department burned in 1985, the computer records survived just fine.” I stated as if giving a history lesson.

Her eyes began searching back forth, trying to figure out if there was any other reason I could be bringing this up.

Again, I asked, “How old are you?”

“42,” she repeated firmly.

I furrowed my brow and sighed, leaning back on the couch, I needed her to move on to the next step of “what does he know?”

I leaned forward again, pulled a black and white photo out of the file and put it on the coffee table.  “You look a lot like your aunt Kathryn,” I said turning the picture so she could see.  “Identical, in fact.”

“We have very strong genes,” she said getting a better hold of herself and repeating a lie she’s probably used 100 times.

I pointed to small white line on her forehead and then the picture, “Scars aren’t genetic,” I said factually.

Whatever hold she had was beginning to slip.  There was a lot going on in that head, at this point.  She was trying her best to play the role of someone who has no idea what I was talking about.  She wasn’t very good at it.

“I’m not sure what your point is, Agent Schwek,” she said trying to be offended.  She was getting scared and, as a result, angry.

“How old are you?”, I asked a third time.

This time she stopped, paused, and weakly said, “42.”

“You are not 42,” I said shifting into, well, not bad cop but less good cop.  “You are, in fact, much much older than 42.”

“I don’t..” she tried lying again.

“How old are you?” I asked again, this time firmly.

“What do you want?” she asked plaintively.

“To help you,” I said, “It is my job to protect you but before I can do that, I need you to be honest.  If we’ve figured this out, there are others that will figure it out.  Others whose motives are not to protect people. Others who will want you for their purposes.  Unpleasant purposes.”

I stopped and let the silence sit again.  We had moved the “what does he know” ball quite a bit forward now.

I switched back to good cop, got up and knelt in front of her taking her hand in mind.  She was startled by me coming so close and touching her.  It was an effective strategy with women of a certain era.  “How old are you?”, I asked softly.

Tears began welling in her eyes and she shook her head.  I decided to change the question.  “Where were you born?”

She found this easier to answer.  “Scottland,” she said quietly, “Edinburgh”

I nodded and put my other hand over hers, “What year?”

A tear ran down her cheek.  For people like her, this was not a conversation they had ever had and the fear of being discovered was so deeply ingrained.  I patiently waited while she gathered herself, I could see the decision in her eyes.  She was tired of lying, so very tired.  “I was,” she stopped and gathered herself, “I was born in 1806 … In Edinburgh”

This was a little frustrating for me.  There was no rhyme or reason to where and when these people were born.  If she had said France in the 1790s it would, at least, track with some other data points but 19^(th) century Scottland didn’t correspond with anything. There was no genetic line or environmental circumstance that could explain it.  I had been looking for the reason for so long, all of us had, and every new fact made the problem even more intractable.

The frustration must have shown on my face because she suddenly looked frightened, “What’s wrong?” she asked now quietly crying.

“Nothing,” I said , patting here hand and giving her my best conspiratorial smile, “I’ve met older. You’re a spring chicken.”

Relief washed over her face but also caution.  She’d carried this secret for 200 years and now felt exposed.  It was important and try to bring this back to ground, to something practical and boring.

“First things, first,” I let go of here hand and glanced at my file, “We do a little better bit of forgery over at the Bureau and it’s all compliments of Uncle Sam.” I openly smiled at her, “How do you feel about ‘Theresa’?”

She was confused for a moment and then gave a half chuckle, wiping her tears, “I’ve been a ‘Theresa’ before, what about ‘Joan’?”

“We can do ‘Joan’,” I said, standing up. 

I fished a card out of my jacket pocket and handed it to her.  “You can call me any time.  If you see anyone following you or anything suspicious, at all, call me immediately.”  I could just share my phone contact with her but these people tend not to be very good with technology and like to have physical copies of things.  I’ve seen music and book collections that would blow most museums’ minds.

“Am I in danger?” she asked.

“I don’t know,” I was honest, “Like I said, if we found you, others could find you.  Hopefully we can fix this,” I said indicating the file, “before they find it.”

I sat back down on the couch.  This was the part I liked.  When someone has been lying to the entire world since some time in the 19^(th) century, having a chance to talk to someone honestly tended to open a floodgate.  I always bring a go bag with me on first contacts because, more than once, I’ve sat with a client drinking the last existing bottle of some liquor or wine until the wee hours of the morning.  These people had a lot of stories and no one to tell.  Hearing a story about World War II is one thing, hearing a story about the Siege of Osaka in 1614 is something else, entirely.  Sometimes, I think the stories are 90% of why I do this job in the first place.

I tried to lighten the mood, “But, right now, there’s no indication that anyone but us knows about you.  We can keep it that way.  How long have you been in this house?”

Her eyes defocused as the memories came up.  “My husband built it before California was … well, before California was California.”

“Did he know?”, I asked.

“Eventually, yes. Maybe not the whole extent of it but when he turned 50 and I was still 40 he began to suspect something wasn’t right.  By the time he was in his 60s, he knew,” she paused remembering her love of 100 years ago.  “We never out and out talked about it but he called me his ‘immortal Beloved’”.  She paused again, and in a wistful tone, “We were very happy.”

I nodded.  Loss was a constant in these people’s lives.  They understood better than most people the impermanence of everything around them.  I have a client who still insists the “whole United States thing” is just a fad.

“Agent Shwek, how many people know about me?” she asked, starting to think about the reality of her situation.  That was good.

“There’s 23 people in our division and we’re carefully selected and trained for this purpose.  Your secret is safe with us.” I assured her.

“I have to trust a two dozen American supercops, huh?” She joked.

“Actually, I’m a social worker by training,” I confessed, “I’ve never actually shot a gun in my life.”

She tilted her head and offered a wry smile, “Let me guess.  You worked with the elderly.”

“As a matter a fact, I did,” I nodded, “But this is quite a bit more interesting.”

She thought for a minute, and I could tell what she wanted to ask so I just answered it, “We have a little over eight hundred people in the program.”  I let her digest that, “We don’t really know how many there are but our gueestimate is around ten thousand worldwide.”

This always took them a minute to process.

“Ten thousand,” she said to herself, “I never thought…” and trailed off.

“Joan,” I leaned forward, “You’re no longer alone.”

I went to go report that I didn’t receive my donuts so I could get a refund for it, the total for the donuts was 10.69 or something, and after I explained everything to them, they refunded me $8. Not the full amount for my missing stuff, but $8, how does that even make sense? How are you gonna refund me for an item I didn’t get and NOT give me the full amount back lmfao. The proof is all in the messages between me and the driver so they can’t even try to say I’m lying or anything. Support wouldn’t even answer my questions, or tell me why I can’t get the full amount back. I understand it’s only $2, but it’s the moral of it, thats ridiculous. Like I didn’t receive my stuff and I only got a partial refund. Ridiculous.",7,1739234981.0,postmates,2,1.0,False

1imm4ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1imm4ia/my_boyfriend_is_refusing_any_type_of_professional/,My boyfriend is refusing any type of professional help and things just keep getting worse.,"My (22f) boyfriend (24m) has had a sharp decline in his mental health for the past year and a half. It has become especially bad since the new year. He struggles with acting irrationally when faced with any challenge, big or small. For example, he accidentally dropped a shot of coffee the other week, and he became really upset and kept saying that he “can’t do anything right” and that “nothing can go his way”. I spent probably an hour or more comforting him and trying to get him to calm down. Same thing happens when he loses in a video game or something else small like that. Things that would be a small annoyance to most people seem to become a massive spiral into self hate for him. 

I’ve tried to approach the topic of professional help (a GP, therapist, etc.) but it’s always met with severe resistance. After another breakdown over losing a game of 2K this morning, I brought it up again and it led to a massive fight. He doesn’t feel comfortable seeing someone, and I understand that. I have a long history with poor mental health and have been through therapy many times. I know it is hard to make that choice.

I don’t want to force it on him, but these incidents are building up and it’s getting to a point where I’m constantly anticipating the next meltdown whenever something small goes wrong. He feels like he’s being attacked any time myself or his family brings up therapy to him. To be honest, it’s making me absolutely miserable to watch him struggle with self hatred, and the damage it’s doing to our relationship. It feels like there’s bound to be a massive issue every weekend and I’m always on edge.

I don’t know how to support him or what to do from here. He’s on a walk right now to calm down after this morning’s incident, and I just feel so angry, upset and depleted. I miss my boyfriend and watching him fall deeper into depression is so awful.

What do I do?

edit to add: He is struggling with weed dependency, and has been trying to cut back on how much he is smoking lately, so that does impact his mood as well.",0,1739234803.0,depression,2,0.5,False

1imm1wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1imm1wg/mind_blown_by_the_baratza_esp/,Mind blown by the Baratza ESP,"I spent around 15 years in the specialty coffee industry professionally in the sf Bay Area. I had been out of the game for a while but had missed pulling shots. I saw the Chefman espresso machine at Walmart for $50 so I snagged one. 

I knew it wouldnt be perfect, but I wanted to exercise those muscles and have some fun making coffee again. I got it home and messed around with it a bunch, mostly frustrated that I couldn’t get the sweet, syrupy shots I wanted with my Encore. I snagged an open box deal on an ESP after reading some pretty positive reviews, as well as a respectful nod from James Hoffman. 

I got it today, set it up, started at the recommended setting of 15, and put a handful of beans through to season it a bit. Then I dosed out 18g of Fritz coffee, ground it, a little WDT, tamp, and puck screen. Hoped for the best and hit go. 38 sec, 35g out. 

I couldn’t believe it. The first shot was amazing. Viscous, great flow, beautiful crema, just a tiny bit acidic but in a pleasing way, with no bitterness, no harshness in the finish, just an incredibly satisfying shot of espresso. 

Can I do better? Sure! I just can’t believe the difference after one shot. This is going to taste amazing in some oat milk but honestly, it was the best single shot of espresso I’ve had in recent memory. 

Anyone else have a similar experience?",1,1739234589.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
