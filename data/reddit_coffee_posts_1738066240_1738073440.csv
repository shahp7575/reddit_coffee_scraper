I see questions of that sort a lot, if its alright for a guy to have traditionally ""feminine"" hobbies, but lately I've been thinking about my own hung ups, for my whole life I got along best with women and all my male friendships didn't last long for various reasons, mostly me no longer being comfortable among edgy boys and I'm yet to find a male friendship that wouldn't turn toxic. 
I feel the problem is, Im unsure how to feel about my female relationships, I've been raised among women and that's whom I best get along with, I like hanging out with women most and I enjoy their attention and the fact that I know exactly what to do to make them feel appreciated.
Thing is, I have some hung ups about it. I enjoy going to the coffee shops and then going shopping even though all my female friends hate shopping, I find immense joy in it even if I don't buy anything. I like bringing them clothes to try on, helping them decide, looking for cool stuff for myself. I'm not even a big fashion guy I almost always wear street wear but I enjoy going to any store (except make-up stores, because those are boring).
One of my favorite activities is going window shopping with my girlfriend or friends and just having fun looking at things.
I don't go shopping often, but I do enjoy window shopping a lot. I feel like it's such a feminine thing, since most men hate shopping. How to tackle this insecurity?

TL:DR: I like shopping with girls and Im a guy and feel bad about it.",2,1738073101.0,ftm,1,1.0,False

Was a store manager at a coffee chain before I got into a car accident and broke my ankle and was off for 5 months. Since I passed the 12 weeks of FMLA, they let go of my postition and gave it to my coworker. Even after telling me they were going to hold my position until the 1st of January. 

I went back to work the week of Christmas, and was told that I'd at least be able to 'interview for the assistant position' against another gal, but I would 'automatically get it due to my experience.' 

Fast forward to a month later, there has been zero communication with me, my boss, my coworkers and the person I'm up for assistance against. They passed their manager training and has spoken to my boss, but again, no words to me. 

I've been demoted to closing shifts, haven't had any manager duties, and am getting fed up. Talked to a separate coworker about looking for another job, and was removed from the next week's schedule. Again, no communication from my boss or my new store manager. Just not on the schedule. 

When I asked my boss, he also had no reply. My plan was to go into my store today to pick up my shoes and my servsafe certificate and leave. But this morning I woke up to a text, finally from the gal who took my position as store manager, saying she can put me on the schedule. Again, no communication at my demotion, my position to assistant, anything. Just whoops, sorry you saw a schedule shared to the boss without you, we just didn't figured you cared, again, no communication. I'm tired of this. I put two years into running that store before my accident.

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1ic26so,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1ic26so/turning_a_side_hustle_into_a_fulltime_gig/,Turning a Side Hustle Into a Full-Time Gig,"Alright, let’s dive into this because let’s be honest: the leap from side hustle to full-time business can feel about as comfortable as a high diving board when you’ve never even been in a pool. It’s that thrilling, terrifying, and incredibly rewarding all tied up in one big, life-changing jump.

1. **Know Your Numbers**: First up, let’s talk finances. You need to get cozy with your financials like they’re an old friend. Start tracking your earnings and expenses or, in layman’s terms, put on your accountant hat (you know, the one that feels slightly too tight). Understand your cash flow, establish a budget, and if you aren't already, start saving three to six months’ worth of living expenses. I know, it sounds daunting, but think of it as your parachute when you jump. You want it to work!

2. **Clarify Your Vision**: Dream big — really big. Can you see it? The exact life you want to create? Write down what you want your business to become. Use all those lovely adjectives that make your heart race. Picture your ideal day: what does it look like? What are your goals? Without laying this groundwork, you'll be like a ship adrift at sea without a compass: you might end up somewhere, but it probably won’t be where you intended.

3. **Mindset Matters**: Brace yourself for a mindset shift. This isn’t just about transitioning from side hustle to full-time; it’s about officially embracing your identity as a business owner. You have to be ready to walk into that role with confidence. I won't lie; self-doubt will inevitably tap you on the shoulder and make you question your life choices while you’re trying to enjoy a cup of coffee. Recognize that doubt and say, ""Not today, friend."" Replace negative thoughts with affirmations that reinforce your worthiness and potential.

4. **Create a Safety Net**: As you edge closer to your full-time dream, don’t just dive in headfirst. Instead, dip a toe in first. Keep your day job until your side hustle proves it can run on its own for a while. This isn’t just wise; it’s like having a soft landing during a tricky jump. Develop a clear transition plan that maps out when and how you’ll make this leap. That way, you won’t have that panic-inducing “what did I just do?” moment.

5. **Build a Support System**: Surround yourself with a community—this is huge. Find mentors, friends, or even an online group of fellow hustlers who can offer encouragement, share experiences, or just cheer you on from the sidelines. I can’t tell you how many times a simple “You got this!” from a buddy kept my own dreams from flatlining. Trust me; faith and community go hand in hand.

6. **Create an Exit Strategy**: Give yourself a timeline. Set benchmarks and milestones that you want to hit before you take the plunge. It could be reaching a certain income level, enough clients, or maybe all your arbitrary metrics of what ‘success’ looks like. This structure can help to ease the transition and allow you to celebrate those little victories along the way.

7. **Embrace Flexibility**: Finally, be prepared for the unexpected. The road will not always be smooth. Remember your journey is unique, and what works for someone else might not work for you. Consider every challenge a lesson. You’re not just building a business, you’re embarking on a transformative adventure where God might be trying to teach you something juicy.

Transitioning from a side hustle to a full-time business is a big deal. But with these steps, a good dose of prayer, hard work, and maybe a few chocolate bars along the way, you’ll find not only the courage to jump but also the joy in building something that reflects your passions and purpose.

I used to love the mornings.

The sounds of the house as it creaks gently in the early hours, settling into its foundation like a sleeping giant still in the midst of REM. The crickets playing a song while the frogs call out to friends. Lights are off in the house but a few small dims to show the way for sleepy feet while the stars overtake the sky. I would wake so early, four or even three in the morning and sit on the pool deck, listening to it all. It was peaceful. It was soothing. It gave me energy to take on the day.

You would never wake before eight if it could be helped. Night was your time to thrive. Where I would be getting ready to settle in, you were growing excited for all you could do before bedtime. While I slowly sipped on the last dredges of my nightly tea, you were sucking down your fourth cup of coffee. I had to go to sleep before you, because I knew if I didn’t, your energetic jumps into bed for slumber would keep me awake.

How is it that we worked so well together when we were so overtly different?

And our daughter was perfectly in between it all. She could stay up just late enough to enjoy a show. You would snack on bread and pretzels as you talked about life’s mysteries, came up with come-backs for the bullies, or discussed the injustices of anything you could think of.

Gosh, she was such a brilliant child. The world will fall to ruin for the loss of that beautiful mind.

You two owned the evenings like a pair of giggling, naughty school children. Making messes, breaking dish ware or other fragile things, then shushing each other as you tried to sneakily clean it up. The chuffing would often bring me out to see you two trying to hide the shame of your most recent rough housing. Your apologies would spill out behind suppressed grins, furtive glance at each other and clearing throats as you tried to act surprised about the wreck behind you.

I’d pretend to be angry and give out scoldings, though I could never truly be upset when I’d look into the eyes of my two favorite people. Then we’d clean up as a family and make plans to go to the shops on our day off and replace whatever lost the war to the antics of you and our baby.

But mornings; that’s the time I loved the most. I could sit in the peace of the musical world. No plans to make, no thoughts to clog my mind, just me and the darkeness.

Then, just as the sun was beginning to bring a bit of light to the sleeping world, a sound would ring out over the emptiness. Usually groggy, shuffling feet or creaking wheels that would break the silence as it moved across the bricks of the pool deck. And then a small, warm hand would reach my side, pull a body with it, and our sweet baby would clamber into the chair and snuggle in close.

She used to be so small she could curl into my lap like a puppy, but at one point, though I’m not sure when, she was too big for that, so she’d squash me into the chair so we could sit side by side. Sure, it was uncomfortable, sure, it left both of us sore and aching, but we would still just sit and enjoy the peace of the morning.

We’d watch a stream together, talk about whatever she could imagine, plan her day or think up marvelous stories and adventures. Sometimes, if one of us was feeling unwell, we wouldn’t talk at all. We didn’t need to. We just needed to be with the other. To have the pressure of our loved one pressed into our sides as the world slowly woke before us. The heat of our bodies providing warmth to the other.

Remember love, last week when I was complaining about hip and back pain, and your first thought was the chair. How it was getting too small for our baby and I and we should replace it. You wanted to get something bigger. Something that all of us could sit on together. You picked one out even, and we were meant to have it delivered on Thursday.

I’m sorry, my dear love, but I’ve canceled that order now. It’s too big for me alone. But, this chair feels so empty now. I can’t bring myself to sit in it. Will it collect dust like our bed? I’ve had to stop using that too. And you know I can't reach the cupboards, so I won’t be able to clean up there either. How long do you think it’ll take for the blanket of the forgotten, the dirt of the unused to layer itself onto the things I can no longer think to use anymore?

I’m not sure I can ever enjoy a morning again without her by my side. The frogs are too loud and the crickets bring me more annoyance than calm. Those tiny hall lights are bright on my eyes, though I can’t convince myself to unplug them. Yet I don’t like the darkness of the outside anymore either. The stars still shine, but they will always have each other, while I am left in this house alone.

I can’t even bring myself to get out of bed anymore, if the sun has yet to rise fully. I just lay there, in the spare room, staring at the empty wall. Why did we never put pictures in here? It sounds so different on this side of the house though and sleep is so hard to find.

Maybe that’s why I stay in bed. I’m just tired still. Or is it because it’s hard to eat and my body needs more rest to make up for the lack of nutrition? Honestly, I think it's because the world is too heavy now. I never was a strong person. I always needed you and our baby to help me carry things, but now I’m forced to do it alone.

I think I hate the morning.

There was only the calm rustle of the batches of evergreen outside, and the occasional faint call of the fast ferries—barely audible, as opposed to the ear-splitting blaring she had the displeasure of hearing last night. For a time. It was deafeningly quiet in the Victorian-looking library, save for the occasional venom-laced whisperings Uzi was smart enough to infer was specifically tuned for her to at least faintly overhear. It was always her. It was always something about *her* specifically, wasn’t it? The drone leaned against the walnut chair, bracing her book against the miniature parapet of the same material that intelligently held two sticks of light within it. But where the humans were seated looked as if they had been a replica of a Renaissance-era painting down to the most minutiae detail. Uzi’s finger twitched. Dimmed lights cradled in what looked to be gothic-style ornate mini-balconies hung low—but not too low—from the stained-glass paneled ceiling as far as the eye could see, even somewhat stretching into the drone area, held in place only by a single sturdy chain of the same color. But there was a maddening difference in quality, the hexagonal cradles looked flimsy within her area, as if they were made of simple plastics and not of steel. Or was it simply cheap tin that hung above her? The surrounding architecture within the human area still retained its sprawling Victorian look, but Uzi thought not of spending minutes ogling its design in spite of its ethereal presence. She registered its somewhat celestially detailed appearance—as if the hands of God himself had painstakingly chiseled the stone from which it was made—but at the same time it had halfly faded from her memory. But of course, they had separated that area from her kind, and she was forced to relocate to a small reading room—the Family hadn’t done any “convincing” because that would be far too high-profile for their liking. Typical, but the teen understood. A drone in a human-only area with no authority doing jackshit about it would raise more than a couple eyebrows— *and fists,* she warily observed. Maybe some *Strega* would soothe her nerves. No, the herbal liqueur always gave her a throbbing headache that persisted as a faint throb far into the night. Truth be told, she preferred Irish guinness. Most nights, it cleared her mind with a far better dispelling force than the trickle of rain could be.

   It barely held a quarter of the books Uzi *knew* to be available in such a gargantuan library as this. There were no holo-guides that they could customize to guide them to the book they wished to read—if it was available to them. The room she was sent to was more of a child’s closet than an actual room worthy of being part of a library as this. She was barred from reading any sort of cult classics because it was of topics “only comprehensible to the human mind.” The simple finger-twitching quickly transformed into a rageful shaking that was quick to grow uncontrollable. Papers were dead last on her problem ladder. If only she could ever manage to get her hands on any one of them… Her thoughts stopped there. It had simply collapsed, like a weakened rope snapping after being made to hold over sixty tons worth of cargo, sending it all tumbling into the raging depths of the ocean. Uzi bristled while she rubbed her thumb against the lukewarm pages she had skimmed through, her gaze flickering between the old-fashioned text and the dully sparkling material of her gloves. Anger was ambushed by sorrow, and like the thudding of a rifle’s bullets against flesh it was wrent to shreds. It was a fitting punishment for such a soulless creature as her. There it was again—the *pewt* of a silenced M9, dried blood recoloring what was once a spongy yet coarse black. Every time she blinked, she saw it in increasing detail. Dots of yellowish green and squirming maggots that only moved in centimeters joined the image, though they feasted upon no corpse. *Look at you,* she chided. Uzi winced at her own voice, and the towering text within the book blurred into each other. *You look horrible. You even reading that thing?* 

   Though her hair framed her face and rendered anything besides the dust that flew about underneath the firm haze of the light and the book itself invisible, she felt *eyes* burn holes through the side of her head. The whispers had become near-inaudible, sending courses of dread shooting through her veins—she no longer heard them! Her auditory receptors began to ring; a maddeningly faint shriek, as silent as the whispers that grew ever fainter, slithering to the back of her head and pushed against the bone. With a rapid glance, Uzi made a half-hearted attempt at making sense of the crusted texts within the book, but her gaze was always pulled to the yellowed, crusted edges of the pages rather than the actual text. *Raskolnikov… Filthy… Dirty… Loathsome, loathsome!* Of all the words that her mind swirled together, it just *had* to be those ones. Wasn’t that her textbook definition? *Loathsome.* Her optics screwed shut, and her expression twitched and spasmed in vain attempts to keep itself neutral.  
  Both her containment and reading had failed miserably, mainly due to her waning interest in anything at all reality had to offer. For her intellect, *her* mind, this was what she was rewarded with? Some shoddy peace-and-quiet area that carried possibly less than a hundred books compared to the thousands the humans had at their fingertips? What was this, a *preschool?!* All she had to do was make *one call,* send out only *one* message to the *caporegime* of the U-District—Enzo Aiello—and these shit-for-brains whisperers would be erased off the face of the Earth come daybreak. The other part of her that argued Aiello would never spontaneously murder a couple of students over some indirect slur-hurling was swiftly suffocated. Uzi squirmed with a sensation that seemed dangerously close to a twisted delight as her mind enthusiastically drew up daydreams of her strangling them to death with her bare hands; or the *Assassin's Special* —a deuce-deuce handgun fully equipped with a silencer—she had not grown out of its usage; after all, she had started off with the gun, though the drone had made the switch to an M9 just shy of a month ago. They'd be on their way across the metaphorical bridge within the hour. Ten, no, three button men would be at their doors. A simple house painting job, it would be over quickly. *Ten buttons would be a waste,* she observed. The grin Uzi had no idea had taken form quickly stretched itself into an almost ear-to-ear smile—if she had ears. 

   The dread that once nearly replaced her oilstream was enveloped by a giddy delight, and the teenage drone nearly slammed the book shut and shot up from her chair. Her thoughts melted into a jumble, and instead of jumping upwards she only found herself skimming through the pages with a speed of increasing ferocity. A feather-light tap on her shoulder jostled her upper body straight upward, and her exhaustion-dulled purple optics met bright neon pink ones. Uzi damn near slammed the book shut, yet the smile had been short lived—disappeared long before the touch. The drone's blonde hair was styled into a messy shoulder-length ponytail and bangs that swung in an arc and covered most of her visor down to the top ridges of her oval optics. She was about the same height as Jade was—about five-foot seven, two inches taller than Uzi herself—and wore a navy blue Polo sweater that had been somewhat tugged off her left shoulder and slightly baggy jeans to match. She leaned forward slightly, gesturing to Uzi's gloves. “You ever take those off?” 

   Uzi huffed. “No.” She simply answered. She rubbed her gloved palm against the top of her hand without much conscious thought.

   “What’cha readin’?” The other drone eyed the title. Her voice was a low hum, a stark contrast to her usual boisterous tone. 

   “Some book. Didn't pay much attention to it.”

   “They let us have that?” She scoffed, though it was not a jeering one, rather a scoff that reeked of disbelief. “Damn.” She quickly shifted the subject. For all her bravado, Lizzy Barlowe knew when to shut up. She got to the point. “Where were you? You just up and left last night.  Didn't even say why.”

   “I said why. You just didn’t hear it.” Uzi's optics zipped to the closed book’s metallic black cover.  Had she come off too rough? Lizzy still held her typical smug expression—unreadable as always. Or was she just fronting? The other drone was particularly tight-lipped about her protection dues to the Family—nearly every drone in U-District was under the wings of the Family, though they knew not who protected them, only that they did it well and charged them to speak not of even the masks they wore—and if it weren't for Uzi's upbringing within the Family, she wouldn't have known they even truly existed. Lizzy had been one of Uzi's first friends since her sophomore year in high-school, and one of the many people she—be it directly or indirectly, depending on the circumstance—kept her actual life hidden away from. If they knew, then they'd be more of an unwitting target then they already were— *if they decided to stick around.* What made her even think they would? *At least they’re protected,* Uzi pointed out to herself in a vain attempt to calm herself down from the swirling broth of emotions that nearly filled her brain to the brim like a steaming mug of coffee. *For now.* It took nearly all of Uzi’s restraint not to growl out yet another string of self-rebuking once again.

   “Yeah. I didn't.” She pressed, a clear invitation for Uzi to reiterate her reason for departing so early.

   “It was gettin’ late, and that murder freaked me the hell out.” Uzi shuddered, holding her mind back from digging up the images once again.

   Lizzy winced. The news of the thing had her looking over her shoulder every five seconds. She gestured for her friend to scoot over. Uzi nodded, shifting herself just enough to make comfortable space for Lizzy to sit. The drone flicked a strand of golden hair from her visor and took her seat, shifting into a relatively comfortable position within the rough wooden chair that were as long as church seats—which quickly gave her thigh a stabbing cramp that oscillated between a simple prickling that darted up and down her leg and the lick of a flame. Lizzy’s optics flitted between Uzi, who was now flipping through the book yet again in an attempt to pick up where she left off, and the desk. The purple-haired girl smelled *off* , that was certain. The faintest scent of strawberries, something fruity, and… *blood.* Was it blood? It barely carried its typical odor, a far fainter hint than the perfume she wore—but she could just about pick up the acrid, copper-like smell. Lizzy Barlowe was an anatomy major with a clear, albeit restricted future in the medical field given her species, a fate set in stone she still held anger towards. Anger that was slowly melting away. At the very least she'd make it to pathology. But she knew what blood smelled like all too well from sterile labs from which the smell clung and wafted off the very walls of it to the point of nausea, mainly due to the grisly dissection of various lifeless specimens that would unfold within its walls. The horrible, cloying stench would stick to her clothes like leeches and be the sole cause of weeks of vigorous washing. It was a smell she never really accustomed herself to, a miasma that made her stomach do resentful flips and kept her up most nights.

   Her mind flashed back to Uzi hurrying out the door the previous night, muttering something she barely caught a word of to Gryffin before leaving both bewildered drones and vanishing into the night in a rush neither had seen out of Uzi before. Originally, they were quick to write the incident off as simply her father calling her to do something—they knew that her adoptive father was none other than the philanthropist Aurelio Rossi, the sole reason why nobody except for the particularly bull-headed picked physical fights with her or even looked her way—but the excuse had run as hollow as drywall now. The what-ifs that steadily increased in their outlandishness raced about in her mind with the speed of NASCAR race-cars. *What if she did it?* Lizzy nearly snapped her head to the left. That was impossible. She *knew* Uzi, she *knew* her. But why did she smell like blood? *There was no way in Hell she'd go near a gun,* she told herself. But the question persisted. Why did she smell like blood? Or was that just her? *She’s not capable of* *shooting a man’s eyes out,* Lizzy’s rationale reasoned. *You’re just too on edge. We’re all on edge, aren’t we? And didn’t you just come back from class? It’s probably you.* Yet the hint of silver persisted, snaking a thin line through her nostrils like seventeenth-century armies and pressing against the back of her throat. Lizzy’s shoulder twitched, and her throat dried. The drone beside her turned to Lizzy, inclining an eyebrow. She had taken notice of her friend’s burgeoning nervousness. “You okay?” The other drone nearly jumped out of her own skin. She nodded with much more fervency than she had intended. “Yeah. M’fine.” She forced her lips into a wobbly half-smile, but the way Uzi's lips compressed itself told her it didn't convince her friend at all. 

  “So…” Lizzy began, her voice wavering somewhat, pinching up a bit, though it was not distinct enough for the purple-haired drone to catch. Or so she hoped. “What’cha thankful for, rich girl?” Uzi shot her a glower, turning and muttering something unintelligible.

1ic1zua,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ic1zua/i_just_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_and_i_cant/,I just broke up with my girlfriend and I can't stop thinking if it was the right decision or not. I feel so lonely right now.,"This will be a long post, but I hope some of you will read it all. I feel so lonely at the moment and reading any comment will help me. Thank you in advance to anyone who goes through my story. Thank you

I decided to break up with my girlfriend a week ago. I’m sorry for the long post in advance. I will try to give context of the beginning of our relationship a I think is relevant and so that you have a bigger picture of our situation. I’m 25, she’s 31. We were together for 3 and a half years. She’s the first and only woman I’ve ever been, both casually and in a relationship. We’re both from South America, but we both live in Spain - she’s been here longer than I. I don’t have any family here, I’m all by myself for work.



When I met her originally, she was just a friend in common, and although I found her attractive, I never thought anything could happen with her (my self esteem has always been quite low, and I never really“thought” of looking for a partner/girlfriend until then)., plus she had a boyfriend at the time. One night though, we were hanging out with our friends in common, and that night we were dancing and got really close, we “cuddled” on a couch afterwards and so on.. And after that, my mind switched completely to trying to have something with her - and looking back, this was really “unhealthy”. I was completely blinded and addicted to her - I made up excuses to see her whenever, I started lacking off work, etc, I did everything I could to “make her like me”.



It all went quickly after that - she broke up with her bf (they were already having issues), I moved in alone and we started seeing each other every day. Since the beginning, I did start seeing things that didn’t really make me feel good, especially talking about anything related to money - anytime I brought anything that concerned me, she would get very defensive, get angry, leave, etc. However, I was so blinded by this feeling I had for her, that I always complied to what she wanted or said - I ran after her, begged and cried.



Things went on like this, and I was always the one trying to advance the relationship - I wanted her to move in with me, etc. After about a year, she got a job close to my house and she moved in with me. In parallel to this, I met all her family (they always treated me very good) and it escalated very quickly - we got a cat, etc.

However - as time went on, I started to see the “bad” side of her personality: one of the biggest problems was related to money. I always had a better paying job than her, she had a really low income. I always paid for absolutely everything: house expenses, food expenses, going out, travel, etc - and I don’t have a problem with this, but what I did have a problem was that everything that she had as income (although low) she would keep for herself and save - while I was struggling to maintain us both. She would try hard to hide her money from me (and her family) to give the appearance that she never had any money, so that people would give her stuff and “help her”. She was able to save up a few thousand euros that she hid (both cash and in her bank that she always tried hard so I couldn’t see her bank app when she opened it, etc).



Many times I felt manipulated by her. She would use guilt to get what she wanted from me. Every time I would bring something up in hopes of being constructive, or tell her something bothered me, she would get defensive and try to turn the situation around to make me the one to blame instead (and she was most of the times successful at this). Whenever things escalated, she would threaten to break up with me, and every time that happened I ran after her and begged her not to do it, promising I’d “fix” whatever she told me I was doing wrong or not doing. She was always very impulsive, and didn’t have any problems saying bad words to me..



At the same time, I feel like she tried to do stuff to “make her look” like she was doing things right. For example, she pushed me to save money together in proportion of our income (e.g. 10% of whatever each makes). However, at the same time I was paying for absolutely everything else, and the rest of her money she was saving for herself. She always brings this up as “I did try to save money”... or she would try to help me organize my finances, but always with my money, never including her income in the equation.

It is true that we both liked to travel and have a good time (me as well).. So I did spend a lot in trips, hotels, etc that we both enjoyed, and that made it hard for me to save up. But I felt like we always had a problem: if we didn’t go out or travel, she’d say we never do anything. However, if I didn’t save money, she would say I need to save, so I couldn’t win. If I ever said anything at all related to her giving some of her money on a regular basis, or something related.. She would get really defensive, tell me I’m selfish and threaten to move out.



There was also another situation with her ex. I always thought (and keep thinking) that she never got over him. She was really attracted to him (sexually). After they broke up, he always tried to maintain contact with him. At the beginning, she did meet him a couple of times for coffee, but after two times, I told her I wasn’t comfortable, and she stopped (although he did talk to her, she refused to meet him). However, some things never felt good for me, for example, he had his phone bill under her name (although he paid it) and she never attempted to remove herself from it, etc. 



Last month I went to my home country for a month to visit my family (she stayed in Spain), and the same day I left, her ex wrote to her and said he thought he saw her at the supermarket or something like that (wasn’t the case). She told me about this, and told me she just replied “no” or something. However, a couple of weeks later we had a small argument on video call, and she told me something that hurt me quite a bit. She said “I could not be alone right now if I wanted to, but I keep choosing you”. It was very easy to see that she was referring to the fact that she could be with her ex at that time if she wanted to, but made it seem like she was “making me a favor” by not doing so.



In any case, last week, we were at the gym together, and she uses an app that tracks steps and you can redeem prizes and stuff. She handed me her phone to do something in the app while she did an exercise, and in this app, you can have “friends”. I looked at this and saw she had a friend called “Jack”. I half-jokingly asked her who this was (she always did the same thing if she ever saw a “female” name on my phone or something). However she got really defensive again, she deleted him immediately and then she demanded to see my phone instead. I refused at the time to give her my phone (although I had nothing to hide). After this, she told me she didn’t trust me anymore and wanted to break up, calling me all sort of stuff (fake, etc). When I saw how she got, I told her to see my phone, but she said she didn’t want to anymore (“the fact that I didn’t give the phone to her in the moment, told her all she needed to know”).



She slept on the couch that night, and left the next morning, not returning for 3 days. During this time, I spoke with friends and family on the phone and reflected, and I thought that if she decided to leave me, I would accept it and not beg her this time - so I did. And this made her really confused and angry, as she thought I’d run after her like always. She came home wanting to talk, told me that she thought I wasn’t the same person as the beginning of the relationship (I suppose because I was much more submissive back then). 



For a brief moment, I almost gave in and accepted to go back with her. But the next day I told her I wanted to talk and told her I wanted to break up. She cried, told me she loved me so much, said that if I really loved her then I would “fight” for the relationship and try to fix our issues. She said she’d never forgive me in her life because I didn’t “fight’ for us. I maintained my position and told her that I’m not sure if this is the correct decision, but this is what my heart tells me to do. We met a couple of times after that just to talk, told her the things that bothered me - she never really acknowledged anything, she just tried to justify herself - she cried again, told me I still had time to go back with my decision, but I said no. Now the only next step is for her to take all her stuff from my house.



But I’m going through such a bad time now. Even though typing all this makes me think about how bad I’ve felt during the relationship at a lot of times, it still hurts so much. I don’t know if this is the correct decision. Of course we had our good moments, trips, laughs, her family.. Etc. she said she pictured a future with me. Am I seeing things correctly? Is she the narcissist I think she is? Or were some of the things my fault as well? Am I leaving someone that really loved me and wanted to have a future with me? I feel so alone at the moment. I have no one else. I keep thinking I made the wrong decision and I know there’s no going back. I also have brief moments where I get confident and validate my decision… but its like 30%. I don’t know how I’ll be able to go through this.

Reading any comment from anyone will help me as I’m so lonely right now. I really really appreciate anyone who read all the way to here.

Idk why but I naively thought something like this would never happen (to me). I think I just got too big for my boots haha. I finally came out to a few friends in December and to one of my brothers who I am super close with. I received nothing but love and joy from them and it made me feel so so special. Like words can’t even describe. Being gay was something I thought I would end my life over not even a couple years ago, so to then be praised by some of the people around me for taking my mask off gave me a breath of new life that I cannot even begin to articulate.

For context, I grew up making good grades, playing sports, being the “golden child”, going to a good uni, graduating, getting a good remote job in finance etc. Not that remarkable in the grand scheme of things but I felt it was enough to make me special I guess. Nobody in my family did what I have done up to this point. It made me feel soooooo close to being special. Liked. Adored. Unconditionally loved and admired. But alas, the bubble has popped. I will never be special because that’s just how the world works for people like me. Everything I’ve done for the first 24 years of my life has been for the approval of others and it will never be enough because to most of them I am still an abomination. Perverted. Less than. Wicked. 

It’s humbling, but a wake up call that was needed I think. If my own mom doesn’t even want me as I truly am then I think it’s time to wake up and smell the coffee. This is how the world works.

I am the leper.

What’s really hard to process is that I really love my mom and I know she loves me. We got along so well. Always have tbh but religious psychosis is a whole different animal I guess. I’m not mad at her.

Here’s the catch: these robots couldn’t fully rid themselves of human programming and ended up embracing it as part of their identity.

You play as a **robo-smith** who’s just taken over a small repair shop in the middle of nowhere. The gameplay is a mix of **narrative-driven simulation** and **mini-games**, focusing on your interactions with fascinating visitors and customers.

Still you're important to me and I hope we can talk one day.

But for now, I have a life to live. And one that I won't let you make unhappy anymore. Your opinions of me are yours, I respect them but I will not let them dictate my self-worth anymore. 

Forgiveness will set you free as much as it has set me free. I forgive you for saying what you did. I don't care if you meant it or not. If you did, you never really knew me or respected the love I had for you in the first place and I'm glad you're not in my life. And if you didn't, then you should have talked to me,  communicated with me rather than leaving bloody inflamatory messages and screwing with my head!. But our relationship was toxic, as much as I hate to admit. I hope you grow from this and if someday you do decide to communicate its...never too late. Even if you don't its okay. 

I've made my fair share of mistakes, but you did too. If you would have been open to repairing this, it would have been better but I can't force you to be in my life. I tried asking, begging, and you even gave me hope of meeting me but then you blocked me before we could meet? I won't be played with anymore! I'm DONE.

Go on, go away I don't want to keep someone in my life who didn't care enough to try to fix things. You'd have come back if you cared. You'd have talked to me if you cared. 

My true love wouldn't have been this way. She would have not broken up with me on text. True love is someone who doesn't just stay when things are good, but also sticks through when the going is bad. You never did the latter, but I don't blame you anymore.

I forgive you.

I still care about you, and wish you the best in life. I'm open to talk about things happily if you wanted. I still love you, but I can do that from afar and I don't have to be in your life to do that.

I have moved and will live my life but still you'll always hold a soft spot in my heart. 

I hope one day we can just sit in a coffee shop and laugh about this whole thing happily. Maybe it's just a dream but it's a beautiful one isn't it? Goodbye .. I'll miss you.

1ic1vm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1ic1vm2/poor_customer_service_scores/,Poor customer service scores,"Hi, I’m a barista at a big coffee chain across the uk, I haven’t been in work for 2 years prior to starting at my barista job so I’m a bit weak and lack experience in that terms. 

Every week the customer service scores are amazing except from the days I work my shift. They go down exponentially. It’s upsetting because I literally have to keep this job or I can’t study in London anymore. 

Everyone knows I’m a trainee because I wear a shirt that says I’m a trainee. Yet I’m the only trainee that gets negative feedback. Yes I’m slower, but I only work 16 hours a week and I have my studies to focus on. I let the whole team down because there’s a set score on customer service that I need to achieve. We receive a bonus if we meet it. 

How do I get faster? I would rather do the drink right than rush and get it wrong. I’m also under a lot of financial pressure too and I’m not sure what to do. All I know it’s making me sad. I cry during my breaks because I recently went through a rough breakup with my ex boyfriend. That is also affecting my work performance. I also can’t memorise drink orders (I know the recipe) but tell me three drinks to make I’ll probably forget and keep asking. 

I’m sad too because when I ask the customer to repeat the order they get agitated. 

I also remember a time I was serving people, they were being extremely passive aggressive. There was a couple, they looked at me, looked at each other, then looked at me. In a judgy way when everything I was doing was correct. I’m so upset and feel that I’m the worst at my job even though I’m so low in mood at the moment because of my breakup. I must mention I often have memory issues, for example if someone tells me something, I need them to repeat it 3-4 times which can be frustrating because I can’t take in all the information at once. 


TL;DR: I’m too slow at customer service and don’t know how to get faster. I need help on how to memorise multiple orders and how to stop crying on my breaks due to my breakup. ",1,1738071933.0,barista,1,1.0,False

I  started dating my boyfriend 8 months ago , we're from the same culinary school. Now he had two female friends in his class who he seemed very close to, one of whome we infact thought he was dating before he started talking to me. Now when we got together, we had the discussion about friends we're comfortable with the other having etc, I have two  guy friends whom I hang out with from my friend group, I stopped talking to the other guys from the group when I started dating my boyfriend because many of them have tried hitting on me before, so I only hangout with the two who have been more brotherly and never crossed the line. I had them over a few times so that my boyfriend could get to know them and he said he's okay with them and I never hangout with them unless my boyfriend is there or if my girlfriends are there as well . I had asked my boyfriend is anything had happened between him and his two female friends and he said no at the time. But a few months later when we were visiting my family in my home town he revealed that friend A once asked him to kiss when they were out drinking. I told him back then that considering he hadn't told me about it before its a bit weird for him to keep hanging out with her considering how he'd never want me to hangout with anyone who tried hitting in me before we started dating. Also there were a few times when he went out for coffee with them without telling me. Now when college restarted for him he went out for coffee again with them and I saw that Friend A , who had wanted to kiss him, had taken several candids of him eating etc and continues to act flirty with him . I told him that it makes me uncomfortable him hanging around with them so much and he said that he doesn't even talk when they aren't in college and it's hard to avoid them in college and he couldn't make excuses for not going for coffee since they were on break for an hour and that ""ig he tells them that my girlfriend is uncomfortable with it "" it would be weird. So I said he doesn't have to give my reason and can just say he doesn't want to go so he just said okay sorry baby. Today and yesterday we had an exam and were at college and on both days, the instant we entered he walks straight to them to talk with them. Now  I overreacting? Because I feel like he's being hypocritical, whenever he's been uncomfortable about anything with my friends I've apologised and made sure that I didn't do anything to make him feel liek that, and I feel like when the roles are switched he just says ""sorry baby"" and doesn't actually think about my feelings or his actions at all. Should I bring this up or just stop putting in so much effort? He keeps talking about how he wants to marry me and we're unofficially engaged etc, but I feel like he still values his so called ""nit that close"" friends feelings over mine.",5,1738071587.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

• Centering couch on wall
• remove large end table from in front of window and moving it to other side of couch
• bringing the 3 legged end table in to the center of the room (and pairing it with its twin for a more typical ""coffee table"" vibe)
• swapping the futon and folding chair (yes, I will replace them in time)
• pulling the dining room table out to center it with the pendant
• pulling the couch out to make it level with the large end table.
• moved around some lamps to test the vibe
* added a blanket to the couch

I also dropped a few pics of some of my other favorite little spots throughout the house just for fun. Btw, I don’t intend to leave that big plant on the kitchen table, just needed to set it somewhere for the time being.

We are not feeding people with a proper meal. Don't worry, everyone is local, we are not hosting over a meal time, and we will make it clear in invitations etc that we are not providing food.

I appreciate this is not the usual way of doing things. I would still like to provide a nice experience for our guests, even if it isn't what they are used to. There are several constraints: we won't be able to store things in the room beforehand and we need to clear up relatively quickly afterwards. We will have the room for an hour and a half. The season will be winter (February 2026). A very small group of us will be going out for dinner afterwards but not everyone. 

I am thinking of providing mini cream cheese bagels (Bagel Factory do platters you can order and includes vegan and gluten free options), slices of cake (two big 40-person Colin the Caterpillars with some vegan/gluten free mini options) and a selection of biscuits, with napkins. We could hire some vessels or airpots for dispensing hot drinks, and could provide instant chai, coffee and hot water for tea, as well as milk, sugar, cups. I will ask friends in advance to help with set up (most will need to be done during the ceremony and our wedding coordinator has advised she can help with that so friends don't have to leave the ceremony) and clearing up after. I spoke to a coffee cart about providing barista coffee but they said it would be really challenging to serve 100 people over an hour and a half and also getting them in/out of the room within that time. 

We would do the cake cutting with our guests present, play music on speakers and have a Instax camera and guestbook. 

Costs so far:
Room - £100
Main cake - £100 for caterpillar cakes
Vegan/gluten free sweet snacks - £20
Bagels - £350
Biscuits - £10
Instax - £80
Instax film and batteries - £50
Total so far: £710

Not costed yet but guessing will be at least £300
- tea, coffee, chai
- napkins 
- cups 
- vessels/airpots for serving hot drinks 
- bunting

Is there anything more you think we could offer to elevate the experience and make our guests feel part of the day? Trying to keep costs for this element of the day under £1500, so possibly have £500 left.

Any ideas greatly appreciated.

I have been making espressos for one year and I now start my journey in pour overs using a V60! I got the ZP6 as for me flavor separation is the most important thing and I don't mind at all ""tea like"" body. I tried the basic recipe of Lance Hedrick (15g in -> 45g bloom for 30s-2min -> 230-250g of final weight) and I don't really taste the flavors like I thought I would... Maybe I am just trash at tasting haha.

One thing I noticed is that everyone seems to recommend to grind pretty coarse (5-5.5 on the ZP6), but for me even with an Ethiopian coffee at that setting it drip through very quickly (40s-60s after the bloom to go to 250g), is that normal? And yes I zeroed the grinder. I use third wave light roast water and T90 filters.

It was one of those fights where both people get overwhelmed and it gets kind of blown out of proportion. I definitely could have brought up my points more maturely, but I feel like he crossed a line. I dont want to make this a novel, but I will try to add enough context because I definitely was wrong too.

sunday night-We both have work monday-friday (typical office stuff), he works from home monday but I must go in office monday. I also have a 45 minute commute each way, meaning I must get up at 6am. He had his friends over until 12:30 am, came to bed talking, eating, etc, so after that I couldnt sleep until sometime after 1. Maybe 5 hours is enough for some people, but getting up at 6 to try to look presentable, make my fiance his coffee and lunch, feed the pets, drive 45 minutes, and work a job where you are doing the work of 3 people so you dont get a lunch break…i need more than 5 hours. 
I let it go that night because he was high/drunk and thats not the time to talk.
Monday- I work every other day from home and have a lot of crap to carry inside cause of it. I have my typical purse and a water bottle, but then have two additional bags for my laptop and papers. I try the knob and im locked out. Again, it is something small but he always locks me out of the house, even when i say im coming home. I try to to fiddle with the key, but the knob wont work because our door is weird. So i have to set all my stuff down. OF COURSE my hair gets stuck in the knob and a junk rips out. It HURT SO BAD. He answers the door after that and i was admittedly snarky and said “oh now you answer the door” while im clutching all my bags (and my hair). Of course, this comment sparked a fight. Again, admittedly i should have brought this stuff up more maturely instead of blurting jt out while I was in a bad mood but i said
-it hurts my feelings when I feel he isnt being courteous. 
-His friends arent over late when he has to go into work the next day, but they stay late when i do. 
-i get up early to make his life easier/unlock the door for him before he gets home, but he doesnt do it for me
He said
-well i was having fun
-no need to yell at me
He then told me that he would just sleep on the couch downstairs and not come upstairs to use the bathroom or drink water if he had friends over that late which i was like that makes no sense, can I just sleep in the guest room if you are going to be up that late.
HE HATED that. I excused myself because i needed a breather. He then yells at me “hows finding a therapist” from the bottom of the stairs (while im going up) and then before I answer he says “is this how your parents solved things, cause they hate each other? Oh this is a great resolution!” Again, i stayed quiet. Then he yells “you are just trying to guilt trip me and you are acting like your mom” 
That is the part that i think most definitely crossed a line. My parents and I are low contact. My mom was a narcissist and my dad was just an enabler. My mom SA’ed me, mentally abused me, and starved me. I was literally hospitalized under her care for being so underweight. My mom has told me she doesnt love me, told me im worthless, no one will ever love me, etc. 
he compared me to the person that has been a monster to me my whole life. He compared me to the person I fear to become every day. After that, I had a full blown panic attack. He then profusely apologized, said he didnt mean it, doesnt know why he said it, etc. 

If anything, i feel like HIS comment where he would sleep on a couch, piss himself, and dehydrate himself is more manipulative than me saying I could sleep in the guest room? 

I just dont know what to do. I feel extremely numb about this comment. it shook me to my core. How do you navigate when your partner says something that crosses a line? Do you just remind yourself that they were being defensive? He is acting like it was him being defensive, but even when Im defensive, i wouldnt try to bring up trauma. Is this something where Im just too overly emotional? I feel like maybe I am expecting too much. Maybe I can do these things wheee I go out of my way, but i shouldnt expect it so to reciprocated. I am trying to act normal, and i still love him obviously…but it breaks me that the one person that is supposed to be in my corner compared me to the absolute worst person I know…",1,1738071249.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1ic1maw,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ic1maw/after_a_super_long_wean_ill_start_my_first_decaf/,"After a super long wean, I'll start my first decaf day tomorrow!","I've been weaning since 2016 or so, coming from 300mg. All my previous attempts failed, even when I weaned over a couple of weeks, so I took the super wimpy road of very long term weaning. In the first years I managed to get down pretty quickly to 150mg but in the years following I only decreased with 25mg or so a year. I think I could have gone faster, but I usually stayed at the same dose for a long time before I felt the courage to face more withdrawal... The milligrams above 50 were estimates, but from 50mg on I used broken caffeine pills to be more precise.

Well, after almost 9 years, tomorrow I'm finally dropping to zero with the exclusion of decaf coffee  (which is strongly regulated in the EU to contain only tiny traces) and decaf green tea (regulated as well) in moderation, which I'll allow myself, but eventually I may give that up as well. So I'll be setting my counter from tomorrow on! Finally free!

Thanks a lot to everyone on this subreddit who have been supportive during my journey. When I struggled with withdrawal, looking at this page for encouragement helped me through it.",1,1738071132.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

In a late level you had to find gold idol looking things and put them into a puzzle.

1ic1k39,https://i.redd.it/fa73avq9lqfe1.jpeg,Embody an aspect of death.,"Below is a list of some common aspects of death, specifically the main reasons that death occurs in humanity.

Apathy: A numbing void, where all passion, emotion, and drive are extinguished. It is the silent death of the spirit, where one feels no desire to act, care, or connect. It is a cold detachment from life, a refusal to engage with the world, leading to a slow, unfeeling descent into nothingness. In its grasp, even survival loses meaning, as the spark of existence flickers and fades.

Chaos: The lack of order and structure needed for one to live. Every life requires order on some level for progress to be made. Disorganization, unpredictability, and collapse of structure can lead to the crumbling of life. To bring chaos is to also bring death.

Corruption: Pestilence, disease, poison, wickedness, depravity. Anything that which tarnishes what is pure. A taint that spreads like a virus, twisting all to its whim. Nothing is sacred to the corrupt. In their eyes, the unsullied will soon be defiled as well, ruined by whichever means. They themselves are tainted, stripped of their purity as they live a cursed existence.

Curiosity: The insatiable desire to uncover, explore, and understand the unknown. It is a double-edged sword—it drives progress and discovery but can also lead to peril and death when boundaries are pushed too far. The pursuit of forbidden knowledge or reckless exploration can bring about the end, as the thirst for answers blinds one to the dangers of the path ahead.

Decay: Wither, wearying, eroding, rotting. All things come to the eventuality in their existence when they slowly but steadily fall apart and die. The all but unavoidable fall into decadence is an ultimately all-consuming aspect which takes to any form of being. All things eventually degrade until they reach the point of nonexistence, no matter how healthy or well-maintained they are; life especially since it is all so purposely finite.

Despair: The user exists in a state of dread that no one can escape. They only feel like giving up for their failures and the loss of loved ones with low expectations for the future. Forced to watch their torment feeling helpless, they linger on wandering the sad earth as a dead corpse with no hope of comfort to mend their broken spirits.

Destruction: Break, crush, destroy, all actions related to damaging the constitution of an object, system, or being. This is the desire to cause destruction toward others, oneself, or a system. The need to kill is such a thrill that user needs to obliterate their opponents to feel contentment: they have an unsatisfying desire for conflict.

Envy: A corrosive longing for what others possess. It is a death of contentment, replacing peace with bitterness and greed. Envy feeds on comparison, turning admiration into hatred and jealousy, and often leads to self-destruction as the envious person is consumed by their own dissatisfaction or failures.

Fear: A primal discernment of a threat. The instinctual sense of danger. It is without reason, unbound. To be truly afraid is when you feel at your core that you're about to die. All living things experience fear, feel danger. The user is within a constant state of terror, paranoia, or anxiety. A person consumed by fear would do anything to not die, even inflict death upon others.

Greed: To possess everything and to waste everything. Everything should belong to the user because they want it, they rightfully deserve it, and they would kill anyone who stands in their way from getting it. They would do anything to make what they want theirs by any means, all they have to do is take it.

Hindsight: Hindsight is cruel clarity of looking back on what cannot be changed. It brings regret, sorrow, and a longing to undo the past, but the inability to do so often leads to despair.

Hunger: The basic need to consume something for sustenance of one's body. To eat lest they starve, deprived of strength to go on living. Every being must feed themselves in some way to maintain their life. One must eat or be eaten.

Intoxication: The urging need to feed something deep inside but can neither truly satiate their blissful high nor relinquish their addiction or emotional state of ludicrous joy to negate other physical aspects. If the user attempts to withdraw from it, they could die, and if they continue the way they are, they will die. Either way, it is a need to desire, to love, to indulge on deathly levels.

Lamentation: The sadness, the grief one experiences for the dying. Either from losing family, friends, or things of value, everyone laments the loss of what they cherished. The sorrow they feel is a pain that cuts deeper than any blade. The torturous anguish is too great to go on living. Sadness itself is a killer, eating away at their happiness and will to live.

Legacy: Inheritance, heritage, patrimony, birthright—legacy can be a cruel burden. For some, it is an inescapable destiny, a life dictated by the expectations, traditions, or sins of the past. To bear a legacy one does not choose is to carry the weight of ancestral mistakes, painful traditions, or oppressive expectations. It is not a gift but a curse, perpetuating cycles of misery and robbing individuals of their freedom to shape their own path. It is a chain that binds the present to the suffering of the past.

Loneliness: The solitude that user feels are too great for anyone to bear, so they would prefer to die than be alone. Yet there are those who would rather be alone, whether it is for their own goals or if they are just in the mood. However insignificant it may seem; it is powerful enough to kill because no one wants to die alone.

Madness: An unstable mind that extracts balancing flows from your physiques. The user hears voices even though they do not know where they come from or even who they belong to. They engage in various activities that are out of the ordinary, and this could be disturbing. It's to reeducate the meaning of insanity and suppress any sense of fear for when the scales are tilted, death is coming for many people.

Misfortune: The uncontrollable cruelty of life. A force that is so random that it bough death through a roll of an unfair dice. It embodies the idea that no matter how prepared, strong, or good one might be, fate can still strike with devastating blows.

Nihilism: The philosophical doctrine that negates the meaningful, positive aspects of the human life. The belief that there is nothing in life, no hope, no morality in themselves or in others. There is no such thing as a soul inside any of us, we are just sacks of meat. Wishing to feel the embrace of oblivion, only death's sweet release can satisfy them. They are totally consumed by ""true"" despair.

Obsession: A relentless fixation that consumes the mind, overriding all else. It is a death of balance, where one’s thoughts spiral into singular focus, leaving no room for growth, connection, or joy. It corrodes reason and drives a person to extremes, often to their own detriment. In its grasp, the object of obsession becomes both a beacon and a curse, pulling the obsessed closer to ruin.

Pride: Pride before the fall of the arrogant. It can be a source of strength, to build someone up. At the same time, it can lead one to destruction.

Rage: Rage is an unstoppable force. Too much of it may spell the end of someone.

Regret: The haunting weight of past actions, decisions, or failures that can never be undone. Regret consumes the mind and soul, forcing the individual to relive their mistakes and dwell on ""what could have been."" The relentless self-blame and longing for redemption can make life unbearable, driving one to despair or a desire for release. Regret is the slow decay of hope, feeding on the memories of a life that could have been different.

Sacrifice: Sacrifice is a rite or act that is often met with solemn aversion. In ancient rituals, sacrifice was essential to the culture and death was inescapable. If the person had the option of having their life spared, they had to have someone else die in their place.

Senescence: Time, while an inextricable and fundamental principle intertwined with space that gives us freedom to function, is a continuous progression that waits for nobody and leads us to our inevitable fate. One can escape a car crash, sickness, and a murderer, but they will still face the bitterness of mortality because none can escape the slow decay of time. When one reach their final ages, their life will finally give out.

Stagnation: The eventual grind/halt of all things when which after eventually running its course along the road will eventually begin to settle in its ways until it can no longer grow or develop in new ways. When this happens, when things stop changing, they eventually stop all together and ultimately die out indefinitely. All things must ultimately come to an end after all those who lose the ability to adapt and alternate themselves or their environment risk the vulnerability to decadence leading to inevitable collapse.

Suicide: The ultimate surrender to despair, a tragic act born from unbearable pain, hopelessness, or a desire to escape life's torment. It embodies the complete breakdown of the will to live, where the weight of suffering eclipses all reasons to endure.

Treachery: Deceit, betrayal, and the ultimate violation of trust. To lead others into ruin through manipulation, lies, or covert actions. Treachery is the dagger in the back of loyalty, the whisper of betrayal that poisons the soul.

Vengeance: The consuming drive for retribution, it is the death of forgiveness and peace. It festers in the soul, demanding justice for wrongs suffered, often at any cost. The avenger sacrifices everything to settle the score, but vengeance is a double-edged blade, wounding both the target and the wielder. In its pursuit, one often finds emptiness rather than resolution.

I spent my summers and weekends etc. home alone, doing housework and farmwork, and later also working a summer job on top of this. If I ""sneaked"" out at all, e.g. just to get some clothes to wear, I was punished with vicious verbal abuse over the phone as though I'd done the worst thing in the world. (I am also quite afraid of the phone now too, big surprise there.)

I was like a prisoner. I never knew what it was like to just go places and do things without massive guilt and fear, and feeling like I was doing something terribly, horribly wrong the whole time. 

I'm in my 30s now and it hasn't stopped feeling that way. I cannot go out and have a nice time somewhere, buy myself something I need or just want, treat myself to a coffee or light lunch while I'm out... I can't do it without massive guilt. I'm supposed to be at home, all the time, being either useful or alone.

I had some shopping and errands to do yesterday, and I spent the whole time rushing myself along and being frantic about it because I felt so awful for doing it, and the longer I was out shopping and doing errands the more guilty and fearful I felt. 

I cannot seem to deprogram myself from this. 

Anyone else also struggle with this? I know exactly what the problem is and where it comes from, but I can't seem to think my way out of it. It sucks all the joy out of doing nice things. I'm tired of the struggle. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Cutting my abusers out of my life has made a difference in making the internalised voices fade, but this one area I feel my brain is too strongly programmed and I'm really struggling.

I am pretty desperate to get some space from my parents. They treat me terribly. No respect for my belongings, scream at me when I get home late (from work!), scream at me when my cat is meowing too much at night, etc etc. The logical solution would be to just move out, but I live in Toronto, and I can’t afford a home or rent on a paramedics salary. 
I have another job lined up 7 hours away where my fiancée works, a job which I’ve had in the past and absolutely loved at the time. My fiancée and I have been long distance for 2 years, and he planned to move to Toronto with me when his job’s contract is up (not until 2030!!) The option to go back to my old job where he is, and buy a home with him, would always be there. But I’d be giving up 2 years worth of raises, seniority, sick days, etc. As a paramedic, time served is directly proportional to perks of the job. 
However, the thought of leaving my siblings in Toronto is tearing me apart. Both are double income so have been able to afford apartments on their own with their spouses. Both are starting their families soon. Missing that is heart breaking to me. Being 7hrs away and not being able to go to coffee with them whenever I want is absolutely heartbreaking to me! But staying with my parents who are incredibly verbally abusive every single day doesn’t seem like an option either.

ang sakit kasi i never saw it coming, kasi you despised all your family members who cheated, kasi you know how your own mom got cheated on, kasi you got cheated on by your ex too, so i thought your course of action would be different. i was so secured na you wouldn't do the same thing. you said your last MU gave you a shit ton to overthink about so why did you pass the pain to me? since saturday i've been cycling through blaming myself, sadness, anger, missing you, hurt, bargaining, comparing myself to your other girl. and the worst part is, i probably don't even cross your mind. you know how to shut off your emotions, i can't do that. i wish i was like you. i wish i can sleep peaceful too.

i reread every single message we exchanged when you two started. even the whole month when you first exchanged your 'i love you's. it was brief pero grabe ang sakit kasi all those times, i was so happy talking to you, i looked forward to resting with you after work, i was so calm falling asleep with you on call. i thought we were finally making progress, i thought i can finally give you the treatment i thought you deserve, we even planned to have our first night sa january. 

come january, i travelled four tiring hours just to see you, shouldered all the expenses, had sex with you for the first time and felt so happy when i fell asleep kasi i was so overwhelmed with the love i felt for you. you didn't notice it but after the deed, i cried a little cause it was the first time i felt such peace. i just wanted to run my fingers through your hair and listen to the sound of you breathing. then morning came, and i saw her notification and now my brain is scrambling trying to identify which is real, which is not, why did i give so much. 

you sold me the dream, eh. i think i was gullible kasi i believed everything you said from the start. that call back in april nung OT ako, you said if we lived together and nagovertime ako, gusto mo pag-uwi ko ihahanda mo na yung dinner, the bath and everything para di na ko mapapagod. your voice was so warm. i wanted that. i wanted to come home to you. i thought for the first time in my life, i'll be taken care of na. i remembered how you wanted me to meet your mom on your birthday kaya i thought this was something serious.

i can't forget your frustration and anger. sa balcony, sa kitchen, when you almost walked out the room. when i kept begging you to message the girl and confess what you did. i even felt like i was walking on eggshells begging you to do that or else you'll get so angry. i was crying the whole time but you won't do anything about it. kasi you don't want to hurt her. kasi gusto mo unti-untiin. kasi her mom just died. bakit? ako ba hindi nasasaktan? bakit sa akin, isang bagsakan yung sakit? hanggang kailan ko to dadalhin?

i never had trouble breathing pero these days nahihirapan ako huminga. parang may nakadagan sa dibdib ko. i have to do breathing exercises all the time, switched coffee to spearmint tea to calm myself down, and always called my friend while crying to sleep. 

i just wanted to take care of you.

I live in the middle of nowhere. I only have a Walmart nearby and target and other big box stores in a town about 15 minutes from me. 

It doesn’t seem feasible for me to support black businesses because they’re so far and few. I can’t drive 40 minutes every time I want a coffee or tea (Starbucks). I can’t order online and wait a week for hair products or body products when I need that supply the day of or weekend I want to do my hair. 

I actually do have a black owned beauty supply store nearby. But the prices are doubled what the Asian owned beauty supply stores nearby charge. And that’s with a lot of black owned products. It’s more expensive! 

When I think about everything I could possibly switch in my routine I think about how much more money and time it would cost me. 

What are some other ways I can support black businesses more often? 

I’ll probably get dragged for this but it’s an honest thought. ",14,1738069174.0,blackgirls,16,0.89,False

I’ve been overweight for most of my life since having my first child at 17 in 2008. 

In November 2017 I started lazy keto and fasting and lost 69lbs in 11 weeks. I kept losing, got down to about 160 by May 2018 and then my life went to hell and I gave up. I ballooned back to 220 by 2021 and have since gained another 30lbs to date. 

I started keto and intermittent fasting January 1 2025. I need to drop 100lbs by December this year. 
I’m eating 800-1200 calories a day as I’m not working or doing anything right now and therefore being lazy. I’m tracking my meals, eating less than 30g of carbs, approximately 50-60g of protein and 70-80g of fat. I weigh everything. I fast 16:8 most of the time although some days are 22:2 and a few have been 14:10. I’m eating healthy foods - the same foods I ate the first time I lost the weight. Eggs, bacon, sausage, cheese, green beans, cottage cheese, plain yogurt, chicken, steak, fish, lettuce, mushrooms, onions and garlic..black coffee or a small bit of heavy cream, water and sugar free soda once in a while..

The scale still sits at 250.4. I do feel like my abdomen is smaller like way less bloating and I can tell my fat is changing in consistency - it’s softer and bead like under my skin - but still no changes in my weight like the last time. 

Any advice? 

The reason I’m not working out right now or doing much is due to a leg injury that’s healing. I didn’t work out at all last time either though..",0,1738069174.0,loseit,19,0.25,False

The only reason why I knew about it was because of their post on Instagram.

I don't think many people understand the importance of following Virginia based accounts across social media platforms. This is honestly my main source of finding things to do because the 'finding' is minimal.

All I have to do is scroll briefly and my algorithm sends me events from different accounts that I follow and even from those that I don’t because of my interaction habits.

[I could made a whole dissertation about how easy it is to trick your algorithm to send you oodles and boodles of VA content, but I'll save that for future posts.]

The point is, if you're so busy following all these accounts that are nowhere near here, of course you're gonna think there's nothing to do here because the algorithm is gonna keep sending you content from California, Orlando, Atlanta, New York City, Japan, England or whomever else because these are the places YOU are telling it you love.

All in all, make a conscious effort to follow more accounts that are actually based in Virginia, Hampton Roads, and your home city or county and you'll be amazed at how many things you've been missing out on right in your own back yard!

Remember it is yet another beautiful day, here in VA!

Has anyone found a really delicious dairy free of milk option without seed oils, specifically for iced coffee? 

I know all the big name brands without oils like malk, simple Oatly, etc., but I have NEVER found an oil free brand that tastes as good with an iced coffee. Obviously the oil was the part that tasted good, unfortunately! 

Before I knew about seed oils, Oatly Original was my go to because it tastes delicious. Although I don’t go near that now, I can’t find a good combo of milks that taste great in an iced coffee. 

I’ve even made my own oat milk many times and while it’s okay, it’s obviously not the same (though I did try adding coconut oil once, yuck). Almond milk is too thin, and I’ve also tried cashew milk and coconut milk which I don’t think will ever go well in coffee. I have to be dairy free, or I would say I would just use grass fed-organic whole milk.

My journey begins on the 2nd of June, three days ago in this year of 2024. I remember the day being quite cold, as it is autumn—almost winter at that time in Argentina. 

The sky was cloudy, with gentle thin tears falling from it. There was fog, a lot of fog, and the ambience was generally humid for the constant rains of the season. I remember waking up wishing I took my life a while back, because in case it wasn't bad enough having lost my mom months ago, another family member just went and died. Not on purpose or anything! No, it was just a car accident. Someone drunk driving. Anyway, now because of ol’ good cousin Lucas, we all had to go to the graveyard on a day like that, on top of the burial being early. 

Looking in the mirror and brushing my teeth, I tried to think about it as a change of routine, since my days were pretty dull. Just surviving, doing absolutely nothing and not looking hard enough or just not getting a job. The water went through the drain as my life escaped from in-between my fingers, unable to keep it together. Jesus, when was it decided that I was to turn 24 this year? 

As I drove out of the city and into the road listening to Será by Las Pelotas, I decided I wouldn't touch not a glass of alcohol. I knew there would probably be eyes around, and given the circumstances in which that idiot died, of course people would be focused primarily on me not doing “my thing”. Because of course, everyone in the family had labeled me as an alcoholic, even if that was a long time ago, it appears that two years of alcoholism are hard to erase from the record. 

I set foot outside of the car my mother had left me. I was so ready to hear something along the lines of “It is because of people like you that…”, “It is due to people like them that…” I opened the umbrella and braced myself, walking towards the entrance. The place was huge, it is the biggest cemetery of the province after all, and one of the prettiest too. I had been there before for different occasions each time, first was because of a childhood friend’s uncle, then my grandparents on specific dates. I found it funny how they asked to be buried there and my family just did that, despite how expensive it was. At least they had the extra money I guessed, good for them!

When I crossed the gate at first no one was around to receive me. I held my umbrella tight and tried to find the person in charge, because well, there normally was someone who had to let you in. And so for some minutes, all I could see was how the cemetery sprawled over the landscape, the different paths it had, without any guidance, seeming like a maze. The statues and monuments, granite and marble, apparently staring at me as if I was some sort of alien, ignoring their own cracks and flaws that time had given them as a warning, they had to retire. I wondered who was managing the place, letting it get so… worn out. 

A frown was visible on my reflection as I peeked through the third window of the building at the front, and saw the room was devoid of any human beings. Man! I was so angry, I had woken up, gotten out of bed and now everyone in the family would think I am an asshole for not showing up, but this wasn't my fault! I sighed and relaxed my shoulders, my left hand reaching for my phone when all of a sudden someone put a hand on my shoulder. 

“Alma” my auntie greeted, showing me a weak smile. 

Not much happened after that. I just remained there, silent, watching as my other family members talked with each other and shared memories of my cousin. I felt out of place. I never really connected with anyone in the family, they felt like some sort of strangers that I knew out of obligation, or formalities. It was such a big family, so many people and no one was even close to knowing not even what my favorite color was. Nevertheless, I knew that I had to be there. And as they were finally closing the hole in the ground, I felt a presence next to me.

“Enjoying yourself?” Asked my younger cousin, Matilda. 

“Aren't you supposed to be like, crying and shit?” I glanced at her askance, not really sure about what she meant with the question. 

“I'm surprised you decided to show up. You could perfectly be the one who killed him.” 

I didn't have a comeback. I wasn't even able to reply, my phone started ringing, and God it was loud. I cursed at myself and buried my hand in my pocket, going away to answer it. By the time I was far enough though, it ceased to ring, and a message that I hadn't seen before popped up. Both notifications were from my dad. 

My heart sank. Of all the bad news I could’ve gotten that day, these were by far the worst. And while he got to enjoy a life abroad, in a first world country, sending me a message from a Café with his younger daughter and perfect wife, I stared blankly at the screen, reading over and over the message. 

‘I have talked about this with Monica. I saw the balance in your bank account that I transfer money to. I'm so disappointed. One would think that you would've done something of use by now, you're old enough to live by yourself. I don't know what to do with you anymore, you're wasting your life. And if it's gonna be like that, this is the last month I'm giving you money. I mean it. I can't help you anymore.’ 

Another message. It was a contact he shared, my ex-psychiatrist. My hands went cold as the shock went away and reality settled in. What did he mean? I hadn't wasted that much money! I still could do something! Mom’s life insurance was bad, did he think it was gonna last forever?! I felt my heart race, my face get warm and saw the blurry vision of tears blocking the way. I put my phone away. I had it coming, he had been warning me. I lowered myself to the ground slowly, squatting down. I cleaned my tears with one hand and still held the umbrella with the other, and I observed the puddles being formed by the water that fell from the crying clouds with tiny waves. A chilling wind whispered to me through the rows of graves, carrying with it the scent of dampt earth and decaying leaves. I let it tickle my cheek and move my hair. I took a minute. 

By the time I started walking back I saw everyone was leaving, each jumping onto their cars or just saying their goodbyes. I waved to my aunt who was talking with the staff and decided it was enough. I turned around and headed to the exit. Approaching the window I first peeked at, however, I stopped. A poorly written poster that communicated they were understaffed and needed a night watchman caught my eye. I quickly took a picture of it while I thought no one was looking, saving the number attached for later. Every chance I got, I had to take. Not like I had any better alternatives. 

The very next day, with a sense of defeat and a clearer head to calm my mood, I made the call. An old man answered, the very owner of the cemetery. We agreed to have a job interview on the next day, “as soon as possible”. But I didn't think too much of it, after all, it was a night shift there, and who in the world would want a job like that? He surely didn't have many candidates, and that was an advantage to my favor. So considering how desperate we both surely were, this would go well. I would armor up and use every tactic and resource I had to get this job, so I dressed with a white shirt, serious pants, high heels and tied my hair up in a bun. A serious independent woman ready for the position!

Yeah that did not go as planned. I had to drive barefoot, when I arrived the high-heeled shoes kept making me struggle in the mud and I had to roll my pants up a little more so they didn't get too dirty. On top of that, it was so chilly that I felt my body shaking every few minutes. I was so tense, nervous and felt so not-ready. In a shocking turn of events, Mr. Pacífico, the owner, whose name is actually Carlos, was very understanding. He was like one of those warm and welcoming grandads that you can see watching the birds and feeding them at a park, with a soft, serene voice. 

“Very well Alma, enough with the background and standard questions” he smiled at me and intertwined his fingers on the table. “I wanna know, why do you want to work here?” 

I smiled and looked down before returning my gaze back to his eyes.

“I find the place to be very special. I think it would be a great experience and I just know that I can do the job well. I also really need the money sir.” 

He chuckled. “I love how honest you are, sweetheart! It is perfectly fine! I know you don't want to work here!, Who in their right mind would? Just tell me, do you fear death?” 

I giggled, thinking I had heard him wrong. However, with the silent revelation that it wasn’t a mistake, I answered. “No sir.”

I got the job a few minutes after that. Or well, at least a trial night. I would be there for one night and if everything went well, I would get the job. This trial was paid, so of course, I had nothing to lose.

It was supposed to be easy. There was no big storm, no client coming for the night, nothing to really worry about, or so I thought. Carlos explained it all to me, he would leave and I would be at the office, the building next to the gate, the only entrance and exit of the place surrounded by pointed fences. There, I had to regularly check the many cameras distributed along the whole graveyard and its various facilities. Landline was working in case of an emergency and there were a distinctive amount of locks I had to learn to use quickly on the door to shut it. I could communicate with him through the old phone or my mobile in case something was out of place, he just told me to have common sense and everything would be alright. I appreciated that he trusted me and all, yet I was still hesitant to stay all alone so when he told me that there was a security guard roaming around, I exhaled with relief. 

 “Oh and by the way, if you see any fog coming from the nearby forest, lock yourself in here and don’t open the door, no matter what happens.” he warned before leaving without further explanation, and the door finally closed.

 I glanced at the computer, unsure if I wanted to sit just yet. There was a coffee machine and a mini fridge next to a cupboard filled with supplies and snacks that he didn’t say anything about, and I would’ve asked about it if only I hadn’t heard the main gate close just when I was about to head out. I sighed and put all the locks on as he had instructed. Taking a better look at the room after, it was filled with stuff to be comfortable during the shift. To be honest, at that point I was just jumping on one leg, this would be the most comfortable, easiest job ever, and everyone else was dumb enough to judge it as scary and not take it. I smiled at the surveillance camera inside the room and surrendered to the chair, sitting comfortably in its embrace. I looked at the walkie-talkie that connected me with Zeiss, the security guard, it was strange not to know anything about the man, but I couldn’t be unprofessional and talk to him because of that, so I decided to instead familiarize with the list of cameras and their locations, which were written down on paper. I had to remember this, since it was my trial night, if anything out of the ordinary happened I had permission to tell the other guy to check it instead of going myself, although normally whoever was closest had to do it. 

After a few minutes of going back and forth between the list and the video on the screen, I leaned back on the chair and got my feet out of those god awful high heels to sit comfortably cross-legged, relaxing in what seemed to be my best job to date. The video of the office could barely capture the top of my head from that angle, so it would be perfectly fine. I was just about to close my eyes when I spotted something moving in one camera, which made me squint because it was a little dark and I could not distinguish it properly. Of course there were lamps and lighting but along with them came certain spots they didn’t quite reach, and this humanoid figure without any flashlight was in one of them. Unsure, I sat up straight and picked the walkie-talkie, pressed the button Carlos had taught me and spoke. 

 “Hello Zeiss, I’m Alma the new watchman, I think I’m seeing something weird in… err…” I failed to remember the name of the location and just repeated the number. “Camera number 11. Could you please go and check it?” I panicked for a short moment as I let go of the button, given that I had told him unclear indications, and saw how the figure began moving again, probably taking something out of a pocket or a belt. I heard static.

 “Good evening Alma, I believe you are referring to me. I am standing in front of the camera, over.” The figure waved. He sounded young, around my age or younger. Was I tripping or were they really this understaffed, hiring whoever came first? I sighed, embarrassed. 

 “Oh, I’m sorry, I thought…” I left the sentence unfinished. “It’s a little dark in those areas, don’t you need a flashlight?” 

 “I have one, don’t worry.” he began walking and left the frame, not saying anything beyond that. 

 I frowned with a subtle awkward smile looking at the device. Yeah I probably was working with someone as strange as the position he had. Who the fuck would be willing to lurk the cemetery at night like that? I mean, staying in a room and watching the whole place was one thing, but actually being out there at night on their own? Most likely someone really dumb, arrogant or a psycho. I put the thing down on the table and leaned back once more, taking my phone out of my pocket. I had some signal, but no WiFi. I forgot to ask for it. 

I rolled my eyes and let it rest on the table too. I watched the footage, still, it got boring after some time. Got over the fact that I didn’t ask and made some coffee anyway, got some pen and paper and started drawing, every few minutes checking if everything was alright and if I could see that Zeiss guy somewhere in the cameras, but there was nothing. I was letting out a big big yawn when I realized I had to hit the bathroom. It had been quite some time since the last visit and my body was letting me know. I got up and put on those diabolical high heels. I attached the walkie talkie to my blazer’s pocket and approached the door with all the locks on. Did I really need them? Everytime I had to head outside I would have to do everything over and over again, kind of annoying if you ask me. I stretched as I felt the breeze letting me know it was windy, which made the temperature more freezing. I turned the lights on when I reached them in the restroom, and did my business peacefully. The crickets sang, the trees’ leaves joined them and the bell rang… I shook my head softly. Bell? Were there bells here? 

 Standing outside, I could hear its faint ring in the distance. I pursed my lips and like a fucking stupid protagonist of a horror movie, went towards it. It didn’t sound like the chapel’s big bell, it was a small one, like that of a goat. I clenched my fists unknowingly as the chill seeped through my bones, my breath unfurling in pale clouds that vanished as I moved on. The lamp posts from the set path were sparse, their dim halos barely enough to push back the surrounding shadows. Each pool of light bringing ahead of it a void so complete it felt alive until the next bright zone. Walking through the cobblestone was hard with those awful shoes, and yet I didn’t stop, as if I was being called, and the minutes froze waiting for me. The bell rang intermittently, closer now, and with it came its faint vibration in the air, as though the sound itself carried weight. When I reached the end of the cobbled track I hesitated for a moment, right in front of me a sea of uncut grass. I wondered how much time it took me to get there, and yet as soon as I caught the repeating sound so near, I immediately got off those high heels. Barefoot now I made my own way through crooked headstones, their etched names half-erased by time. My eyes set on my newfound need. The next repetition echoed unnaturally as I finally reached the small origin of it; a small bell to the side of a grave, with a string attached to something underground. It wouldn’t cease this time, moving continuously as I fixed all my attention on it. I extended my hand and tried to touch the string, and suddenly it went silent. No more movement. The lamps that I left behind grew further apart, and the night deepened. I snapped out of it, scanned my surroundings only to barely see more gravestones with bells next to them. 

“What the fuck…” I stepped back, but as soon as I gave my back to my surroundings and faced the trail I had to return to, all the bells sang in chorus. My eyes opened wider than before, turned around, hand reaching for the walkie talkie at the sight of all those little shits dancing. A slow walk transformed quickly into a jog, and a jog in a run at full speed. They mocked me, they laughed non-stop at how I was a coward, how I left without even grabbing my shoes again, how my finger pressed the button but I was so frightened I couldn’t even spit out some words. My breath began to run out, tears covering my retina and making it hard to actually see what was in front of me, and so with only differentiating between vague shapes and tones light or dark I tripped, letting go of what I was holding. I realized they weren’t ringing anymore. Wiping my tears while still crying, I sat with the minor scratches I had received, trying to recover. But the crickets didn’t talk, the wind didn’t blow, and this wasn’t over. I reached for the only communication I had with someone, and now I talked quietly as I got on my feet again. 

“Hey dude, are the-” I wasn’t able to finish, all I let out was the loudest scream I could offer. I had the brilliant idea to look back once more, and there I saw a vague shadow figure of a man in a trenchcoat. No need to say or do anything else, it was a race to the safe spot. I have never ran so fast in my life, and it was more impressive considering I’m completely out of shape. As I finally approached the door, I could hear footsteps closing in on me which gave me the last shot of adrenaline I needed. I entered and slammed the door, to which loud bangings exploded on it, as if it was someone who came to collect owed money. 

“Please please just leave me alone, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!” I shouted as I backed away. It stopped. I cried for a short second before the door opened by just using the handle, that was enough to make me shriek and throw the walkie talkie as hard as I could to whoever was there. 

“Bitch, what the hell!” It impacted on someone’s head, rather than the floor. The guy held his hand to the place it was hurt. 

I blinked twice, going dead silent. It was a twink. By his voice I could recognize him, it was Zeiss. I covered my mouth and analyzed him. Brown hair, dark eyes, a bit shorter than me and apparently younger too. I was fucked, if this was the security, the whole place and us were fucked.  

“Oh my god I am so sorry!” I went ahead and grabbed him by the arm to make him come inside and letting go to then close the door with all the locks. “This crazy shit happened to me back there and I, I think we are not alone, we must call the police, or Carlos or…” 

“Alma, I see you are scared, but for fucks sake calm down and tell me what happened!” 

“I was in the bathroom I heard a bell and then went to check and there were like a shit ton of bells and they rang on their own and then I ran and there was this man in a trenchcoat that looked at me and…” I explained frantically, no pauses, no breaths in-between. 

“Wait, so…” he crossed his arms. “You just got freaked out by the bells and called me?” 

“W-Well yes! You're supposed to handle these situations!” I gestured desperately- “But what the fuck are you supposed to do if you wouldn’t even be able to take me on a fight?!”

“Girl… are you trying to make me angry or something?” the way he raised his eyebrows told me that I sounded crazy, and he was over the situation. 

“What?, What am I supposed to do with those bells!?, Why did they even ring?, Are there people buried alive down there!?, And the man… neither of us can take him!”

“There’s no man, Alma. We’re alone here. You probably are delusional or just saw a family of goblins standing on top of each other to look human in a trenchcoat.” his calm demeanor combined with that unbelievable explanation left me staring at him blankly, to which he sighed and added. “Look, I get it, it’s your first night and you think this place is haunted, but believe me, it’s far worse than that. I mean, why else the paycheck would be so good?” 

“But the bells…” 

“That’s on you, just ignore them, they sometimes ring, and so what? They didn’t harm you did they? And you could’ve just told me to go check them if you wanted, you even had the two-way radio with you.” he brought up, as if it was the most casual and normal thing ever. 

“You’re nuts, for real.” I frowned with pain. 

“Uh-huh, that’s why I’m the one wearing shoes and you’re the one who’s barefoot in this temperature.” 

“I had to!” I tried to clarify, but he shook his head lightly. 

“Sure, just get your shoes back on and continue your job. We still have three more hours to go.” he reminded me as he unlocked the door. 

“Can you at least come with me to get my shoes?” I asked, taking the flashlight already accepting the situation. 

The man rolled his eyes but agreed, and after escorting me to the office again he left for, as he put it, “Goblin hunting”.

 The last three hours I spent treating all my scratches and getting myself clean again before sitting at the desk and writing the first part of all of this. I was very tired and almost fell asleep many times, but I managed to stay awake and get most of it done, of course while watching the cameras every few minutes. I sometimes saw Zeiss walking around, other times it was just plain nothing. But the night had definitely earned the title of crazy already. It was about to be sunrise when Carlos arrived and opened the gate. I was getting out of the first building, ready to leave, and Zeiss was leaning on a wall nearby, with his arms crossed, yawning. I was congratulated and told I got the job as I was handled the payment for the trial. I must’ve had a troubled expression, because the owner then asked.

“You still want the job right?” With a worried smile. 

“Oh, uh…” I mirrored the smile anxiously, discreetly looking at the money, and then at him again, not being able to even count how much it was total, as it was even more than I expected for this. “Yes of course sir, I just need some rest.” 

 He giggled and shook my hand happily, and we said goodbye. I waved to Zeiss on my way out and I left, having way too much to think about and many things to consider about this job. Getting home felt like a blessing. I collapsed on my bed, slept until the afternoon and woke up late, knowing that I would have to go to work if I wanted to keep this salary. I read the messages Carlos sent me, a contract, some other stuff. But I didn’t reply, I had no clue of what to do yet. 

 

I finished writing this just now and I’ve been thinking that if I hadn’t panicked, it wouldn’t have been so bad. Should I come back?

Raj is intrigued by the idea, and decides to fund this movie. And asks him, whom Omi wanna cast in the movie.

Omi drops a bomb, and shows Raj a short film. It’s shot with hidden camera, and features Priya (36) - Raj’s wife. It’s a film where Priya is dancing in a wedding baraat, and bumps into Omi. The two dance happily. Raj is pretty impressed with the way, Omi has used the camera, edit and music. And also, he likes the idea of his wife returning to something dance/entertainment related field. He gives green signal.

Omi and his brother Karan had a ten year age gap, so after their parents death - Karan had practically been like a parent to him. Omi as a ten year old, was pretty fond of Priya (who back then, was his Bhaiya’s girlfriend). Omi used to constantly day dream about living a perfect life with Karan and Priya. Until one day - everything was over!

As he grew up in this harsh world, he found what had happened to his brother. And how Priya was now living a luxurious life. He would often feel his brother inside his mind, and would want to take Priya for himself. In his head, that would unite Priya and Karan. He started learning to dance, his brother’s old videos and memories helped him a lot. And the hatred for Priya and Raj just fuelled his passion.

Meanwhile Raj Singhania is going through a crisis. He has been not able to get his rod hard for any woman since years now. He loves his wife truly, and he knows that she loves him too. But the lack of sex is eating him up. There was no excitement or color in his life. Until Omi walked into his office with that short film…

When Raj saw Omi (a young guy) dancing with his wife. He felt a current flowing through his body. He felt hard for the first time in years. He saw how Omi’s hands had brushed against the naked skin of Priya’s back and waist. How her giant melons had crushed on Omi’s chest a couple of times. He wanted more…

My journey begins on the 2nd of June, three days ago in this year of 2024. I remember the day being quite cold, as it is autumn—almost winter at that time in Argentina. 

The sky was cloudy, with gentle thin tears falling from it. There was fog, a lot of fog, and the ambience was generally humid for the constant rains of the season. I remember waking up wishing I took my life a while back, because in case it wasn't bad enough having lost my mom months ago, another family member just went and died. Not on purpose or anything! No, it was just a car accident. Someone drunk driving. Anyway, now because of ol’ good cousin Lucas, we all had to go to the graveyard on a day like that, on top of the burial being early. 

Looking in the mirror and brushing my teeth, I tried to think about it as a change of routine, since my days were pretty dull. Just surviving, doing absolutely nothing and not looking hard enough or just not getting a job. The water went through the drain as my life escaped from in-between my fingers, unable to keep it together. Jesus, when was it decided that I was to turn 24 this year? 

As I drove out of the city and into the road listening to Será by Las Pelotas, I decided I wouldn't touch not a glass of alcohol. I knew there would probably be eyes around, and given the circumstances in which that idiot died, of course people would be focused primarily on me not doing “my thing”. Because of course, everyone in the family had labeled me as an alcoholic, even if that was a long time ago, it appears that two years of alcoholism are hard to erase from the record. 

I set foot outside of the car my mother had left me. I was so ready to hear something along the lines of “It is because of people like you that…”, “It is due to people like them that…” I opened the umbrella and braced myself, walking towards the entrance. The place was huge, it is the biggest cemetery of the province after all, and one of the prettiest too. I had been there before for different occasions each time, first was because of a childhood friend’s uncle, then my grandparents on specific dates. I found it funny how they asked to be buried there and my family just did that, despite how expensive it was. At least they had the extra money I guessed, good for them!

When I crossed the gate at first no one was around to receive me. I held my umbrella tight and tried to find the person in charge, because well, there normally was someone who had to let you in. And so for some minutes, all I could see was how the cemetery sprawled over the landscape, the different paths it had, without any guidance, seeming like a maze. The statues and monuments, granite and marble, apparently staring at me as if I was some sort of alien, ignoring their own cracks and flaws that time had given them as a warning, they had to retire. I wondered who was managing the place, letting it get so… worn out. 

A frown was visible on my reflection as I peeked through the third window of the building at the front, and saw the room was devoid of any human beings. Man! I was so angry, I had woken up, gotten out of bed and now everyone in the family would think I am an asshole for not showing up, but this wasn't my fault! I sighed and relaxed my shoulders, my left hand reaching for my phone when all of a sudden someone put a hand on my shoulder. 

“Alma” my auntie greeted, showing me a weak smile. 

Not much happened after that. I just remained there, silent, watching as my other family members talked with each other and shared memories of my cousin. I felt out of place. I never really connected with anyone in the family, they felt like some sort of strangers that I knew out of obligation, or formalities. It was such a big family, so many people and no one was even close to knowing not even what my favorite color was. Nevertheless, I knew that I had to be there. And as they were finally closing the hole in the ground, I felt a presence next to me.

“Enjoying yourself?” Asked my younger cousin, Matilda. 

“Aren't you supposed to be like, crying and shit?” I glanced at her askance, not really sure about what she meant with the question. 

“I'm surprised you decided to show up. You could perfectly be the one who killed him.” 

I didn't have a comeback. I wasn't even able to reply, my phone started ringing, and God it was loud. I cursed at myself and buried my hand in my pocket, going away to answer it. By the time I was far enough though, it ceased to ring, and a message that I hadn't seen before popped up. Both notifications were from my dad. 

My heart sank. Of all the bad news I could’ve gotten that day, these were by far the worst. And while he got to enjoy a life abroad, in a first world country, sending me a message from a Café with his younger daughter and perfect wife, I stared blankly at the screen, reading over and over the message. 

‘I have talked about this with Monica. I saw the balance in your bank account that I transfer money to. I'm so disappointed. One would think that you would've done something of use by now, you're old enough to live by yourself. I don't know what to do with you anymore, you're wasting your life. And if it's gonna be like that, this is the last month I'm giving you money. I mean it. I can't help you anymore.’ 

Another message. It was a contact he shared, my ex-psychiatrist. My hands went cold as the shock went away and reality settled in. What did he mean? I hadn't wasted that much money! I still could do something! Mom’s life insurance was bad, did he think it was gonna last forever?! I felt my heart race, my face get warm and saw the blurry vision of tears blocking the way. I put my phone away. I had it coming, he had been warning me. I lowered myself to the ground slowly, squatting down. I cleaned my tears with one hand and still held the umbrella with the other, and I observed the puddles being formed by the water that fell from the crying clouds with tiny waves. A chilling wind whispered to me through the rows of graves, carrying with it the scent of dampt earth and decaying leaves. I let it tickle my cheek and move my hair. I took a minute. 

By the time I started walking back I saw everyone was leaving, each jumping onto their cars or just saying their goodbyes. I waved to my aunt who was talking with the staff and decided it was enough. I turned around and headed to the exit. Approaching the window I first peeked at, however, I stopped. A poorly written poster that communicated they were understaffed and needed a night watchman caught my eye. I quickly took a picture of it while I thought no one was looking, saving the number attached for later. Every chance I got, I had to take. Not like I had any better alternatives. 

The very next day, with a sense of defeat and a clearer head to calm my mood, I made the call. An old man answered, the very owner of the cemetery. We agreed to have a job interview on the next day, “as soon as possible”. But I didn't think too much of it, after all, it was a night shift there, and who in the world would want a job like that? He surely didn't have many candidates, and that was an advantage to my favor. So considering how desperate we both surely were, this would go well. I would armor up and use every tactic and resource I had to get this job, so I dressed with a white shirt, serious pants, high heels and tied my hair up in a bun. A serious independent woman ready for the position!

Yeah that did not go as planned. I had to drive barefoot, when I arrived the high-heeled shoes kept making me struggle in the mud and I had to roll my pants up a little more so they didn't get too dirty. On top of that, it was so chilly that I felt my body shaking every few minutes. I was so tense, nervous and felt so not-ready. In a shocking turn of events, Mr. Pacífico, the owner, whose name is actually Carlos, was very understanding. He was like one of those warm and welcoming grandads that you can see watching the birds and feeding them at a park, with a soft, serene voice. 

“Very well Alma, enough with the background and standard questions” he smiled at me and intertwined his fingers on the table. “I wanna know, why do you want to work here?” 

I smiled and looked down before returning my gaze back to his eyes.

“I find the place to be very special. I think it would be a great experience and I just know that I can do the job well. I also really need the money sir.” 

He chuckled. “I love how honest you are, sweetheart! It is perfectly fine! I know you don't want to work here!, Who in their right mind would? Just tell me, do you fear death?” 

I giggled, thinking I had heard him wrong. However, with the silent revelation that it wasn’t a mistake, I answered. “No sir.”

I got the job a few minutes after that. Or well, at least a trial night. I would be there for one night and if everything went well, I would get the job. This trial was paid, so of course, I had nothing to lose.

It was supposed to be easy. There was no big storm, no client coming for the night, nothing to really worry about, or so I thought. Carlos explained it all to me, he would leave and I would be at the office, the building next to the gate, the only entrance and exit of the place surrounded by pointed fences. There, I had to regularly check the many cameras distributed along the whole graveyard and its various facilities. Landline was working in case of an emergency and there were a distinctive amount of locks I had to learn to use quickly on the door to shut it. I could communicate with him through the old phone or my mobile in case something was out of place, he just told me to have common sense and everything would be alright. I appreciated that he trusted me and all, yet I was still hesitant to stay all alone so when he told me that there was a security guard roaming around, I exhaled with relief. 

 “Oh and by the way, if you see any fog coming from the nearby forest, lock yourself in here and don’t open the door, no matter what happens.” he warned before leaving without further explanation, and the door finally closed.

 I glanced at the computer, unsure if I wanted to sit just yet. There was a coffee machine and a mini fridge next to a cupboard filled with supplies and snacks that he didn’t say anything about, and I would’ve asked about it if only I hadn’t heard the main gate close just when I was about to head out. I sighed and put all the locks on as he had instructed. Taking a better look at the room after, it was filled with stuff to be comfortable during the shift. To be honest, at that point I was just jumping on one leg, this would be the most comfortable, easiest job ever, and everyone else was dumb enough to judge it as scary and not take it. I smiled at the surveillance camera inside the room and surrendered to the chair, sitting comfortably in its embrace. I looked at the walkie-talkie that connected me with Zeiss, the security guard, it was strange not to know anything about the man, but I couldn’t be unprofessional and talk to him because of that, so I decided to instead familiarize with the list of cameras and their locations, which were written down on paper. I had to remember this, since it was my trial night, if anything out of the ordinary happened I had permission to tell the other guy to check it instead of going myself, although normally whoever was closest had to do it. 

After a few minutes of going back and forth between the list and the video on the screen, I leaned back on the chair and got my feet out of those god awful high heels to sit comfortably cross-legged, relaxing in what seemed to be my best job to date. The video of the office could barely capture the top of my head from that angle, so it would be perfectly fine. I was just about to close my eyes when I spotted something moving in one camera, which made me squint because it was a little dark and I could not distinguish it properly. Of course there were lamps and lighting but along with them came certain spots they didn’t quite reach, and this humanoid figure without any flashlight was in one of them. Unsure, I sat up straight and picked the walkie-talkie, pressed the button Carlos had taught me and spoke. 

 “Hello Zeiss, I’m Alma the new watchman, I think I’m seeing something weird in… err…” I failed to remember the name of the location and just repeated the number. “Camera number 11. Could you please go and check it?” I panicked for a short moment as I let go of the button, given that I had told him unclear indications, and saw how the figure began moving again, probably taking something out of a pocket or a belt. I heard static.

 “Good evening Alma, I believe you are referring to me. I am standing in front of the camera, over.” The figure waved. He sounded young, around my age or younger. Was I tripping or were they really this understaffed, hiring whoever came first? I sighed, embarrassed. 

 “Oh, I’m sorry, I thought…” I left the sentence unfinished. “It’s a little dark in those areas, don’t you need a flashlight?” 

 “I have one, don’t worry.” he began walking and left the frame, not saying anything beyond that. 

 I frowned with a subtle awkward smile looking at the device. Yeah I probably was working with someone as strange as the position he had. Who the fuck would be willing to lurk the cemetery at night like that? I mean, staying in a room and watching the whole place was one thing, but actually being out there at night on their own? Most likely someone really dumb, arrogant or a psycho. I put the thing down on the table and leaned back once more, taking my phone out of my pocket. I had some signal, but no WiFi. I forgot to ask for it. 

I rolled my eyes and let it rest on the table too. I watched the footage, still, it got boring after some time. Got over the fact that I didn’t ask and made some coffee anyway, got some pen and paper and started drawing, every few minutes checking if everything was alright and if I could see that Zeiss guy somewhere in the cameras, but there was nothing. I was letting out a big big yawn when I realized I had to hit the bathroom. It had been quite some time since the last visit and my body was letting me know. I got up and put on those diabolical high heels. I attached the walkie talkie to my blazer’s pocket and approached the door with all the locks on. Did I really need them? Everytime I had to head outside I would have to do everything over and over again, kind of annoying if you ask me. I stretched as I felt the breeze letting me know it was windy, which made the temperature more freezing. I turned the lights on when I reached them in the restroom, and did my business peacefully. The crickets sang, the trees’ leaves joined them and the bell rang… I shook my head softly. Bell? Were there bells here? 

 Standing outside, I could hear its faint ring in the distance. I pursed my lips and like a fucking stupid protagonist of a horror movie, went towards it. It didn’t sound like the chapel’s big bell, it was a small one, like that of a goat. I clenched my fists unknowingly as the chill seeped through my bones, my breath unfurling in pale clouds that vanished as I moved on. The lamp posts from the set path were sparse, their dim halos barely enough to push back the surrounding shadows. Each pool of light bringing ahead of it a void so complete it felt alive until the next bright zone. Walking through the cobblestone was hard with those awful shoes, and yet I didn’t stop, as if I was being called, and the minutes froze waiting for me. The bell rang intermittently, closer now, and with it came its faint vibration in the air, as though the sound itself carried weight. When I reached the end of the cobbled track I hesitated for a moment, right in front of me a sea of uncut grass. I wondered how much time it took me to get there, and yet as soon as I caught the repeating sound so near, I immediately got off those high heels. Barefoot now I made my own way through crooked headstones, their etched names half-erased by time. My eyes set on my newfound need. The next repetition echoed unnaturally as I finally reached the small origin of it; a small bell to the side of a grave, with a string attached to something underground. It wouldn’t cease this time, moving continuously as I fixed all my attention on it. I extended my hand and tried to touch the string, and suddenly it went silent. No more movement. The lamps that I left behind grew further apart, and the night deepened. I snapped out of it, scanned my surroundings only to barely see more gravestones with bells next to them. 

“What the fuck…” I stepped back, but as soon as I gave my back to my surroundings and faced the trail I had to return to, all the bells sang in chorus. My eyes opened wider than before, turned around, hand reaching for the walkie talkie at the sight of all those little shits dancing. A slow walk transformed quickly into a jog, and a jog in a run at full speed. They mocked me, they laughed non-stop at how I was a coward, how I left without even grabbing my shoes again, how my finger pressed the button but I was so frightened I couldn’t even spit out some words. My breath began to run out, tears covering my retina and making it hard to actually see what was in front of me, and so with only differentiating between vague shapes and tones light or dark I tripped, letting go of what I was holding. I realized they weren’t ringing anymore. Wiping my tears while still crying, I sat with the minor scratches I had received, trying to recover. But the crickets didn’t talk, the wind didn’t blow, and this wasn’t over. I reached for the only communication I had with someone, and now I talked quietly as I got on my feet again. 

“Hey dude, are the-” I wasn’t able to finish, all I let out was the loudest scream I could offer. I had the brilliant idea to look back once more, and there I saw a vague shadow figure of a man in a trenchcoat. No need to say or do anything else, it was a race to the safe spot. I have never ran so fast in my life, and it was more impressive considering I’m completely out of shape. As I finally approached the door, I could hear footsteps closing in on me which gave me the last shot of adrenaline I needed. I entered and slammed the door, to which loud bangings exploded on it, as if it was someone who came to collect owed money. 

“Please please just leave me alone, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!” I shouted as I backed away. It stopped. I cried for a short second before the door opened by just using the handle, that was enough to make me shriek and throw the walkie talkie as hard as I could to whoever was there. 

“Bitch, what the hell!” It impacted on someone’s head, rather than the floor. The guy held his hand to the place it was hurt. 

I blinked twice, going dead silent. It was a twink. By his voice I could recognize him, it was Zeiss. I covered my mouth and analyzed him. Brown hair, dark eyes, a bit shorter than me and apparently younger too. I was fucked, if this was the security, the whole place and us were fucked.  

“Oh my god I am so sorry!” I went ahead and grabbed him by the arm to make him come inside and letting go to then close the door with all the locks. “This crazy shit happened to me back there and I, I think we are not alone, we must call the police, or Carlos or…” 

“Alma, I see you are scared, but for fucks sake calm down and tell me what happened!” 

“I was in the bathroom I heard a bell and then went to check and there were like a shit ton of bells and they rang on their own and then I ran and there was this man in a trenchcoat that looked at me and…” I explained frantically, no pauses, no breaths in-between. 

“Wait, so…” he crossed his arms. “You just got freaked out by the bells and called me?” 

“W-Well yes! You're supposed to handle these situations!” I gestured desperately- “But what the fuck are you supposed to do if you wouldn’t even be able to take me on a fight?!”

“Girl… are you trying to make me angry or something?” the way he raised his eyebrows told me that I sounded crazy, and he was over the situation. 

“What?, What am I supposed to do with those bells!?, Why did they even ring?, Are there people buried alive down there!?, And the man… neither of us can take him!”

“There’s no man, Alma. We’re alone here. You probably are delusional or just saw a family of goblins standing on top of each other to look human in a trenchcoat.” his calm demeanor combined with that unbelievable explanation left me staring at him blankly, to which he sighed and added. “Look, I get it, it’s your first night and you think this place is haunted, but believe me, it’s far worse than that. I mean, why else the paycheck would be so good?” 

“But the bells…” 

“That’s on you, just ignore them, they sometimes ring, and so what? They didn’t harm you did they? And you could’ve just told me to go check them if you wanted, you even had the two-way radio with you.” he brought up, as if it was the most casual and normal thing ever. 

“You’re nuts, for real.” I frowned with pain. 

“Uh-huh, that’s why I’m the one wearing shoes and you’re the one who’s barefoot in this temperature.” 

“I had to!” I tried to clarify, but he shook his head lightly. 

“Sure, just get your shoes back on and continue your job. We still have three more hours to go.” he reminded me as he unlocked the door. 

“Can you at least come with me to get my shoes?” I asked, taking the flashlight already accepting the situation. 

The man rolled his eyes but agreed, and after escorting me to the office again he left for, as he put it, “Goblin hunting”.

 The last three hours I spent treating all my scratches and getting myself clean again before sitting at the desk and writing the first part of all of this. I was very tired and almost fell asleep many times, but I managed to stay awake and get most of it done, of course while watching the cameras every few minutes. I sometimes saw Zeiss walking around, other times it was just plain nothing. But the night had definitely earned the title of crazy already. It was about to be sunrise when Carlos arrived and opened the gate. I was getting out of the first building, ready to leave, and Zeiss was leaning on a wall nearby, with his arms crossed, yawning. I was congratulated and told I got the job as I was handled the payment for the trial. I must’ve had a troubled expression, because the owner then asked.

“You still want the job right?” With a worried smile. 

“Oh, uh…” I mirrored the smile anxiously, discreetly looking at the money, and then at him again, not being able to even count how much it was total, as it was even more than I expected for this. “Yes of course sir, I just need some rest.” 

 He giggled and shook my hand happily, and we said goodbye. I waved to Zeiss on my way out and I left, having way too much to think about and many things to consider about this job. Getting home felt like a blessing. I collapsed on my bed, slept until the afternoon and woke up late, knowing that I would have to go to work if I wanted to keep this salary. I read the messages Carlos sent me, a contract, some other stuff. But I didn’t reply, I had no clue of what to do yet. 

 

I finished writing this just now and I’ve been thinking that if I hadn’t panicked, it wouldn’t have been so bad. Should I come back?

The technologies that [define](https://hir.harvard.edu/not-so-green-technology-the-complicated-legacy-of-rare-earth-mining/) much of modern life, including smart phones, televisions, and LED lights, rely on a limited number of relatively rare metals and minerals. But these consumer staples [have](https://hir.harvard.edu/not-so-green-technology-the-complicated-legacy-of-rare-earth-mining/) recently gained new competitors for these essential resources. The push for renewable energy generation and vehicle electrification—sometimes called the green transition—has [placed](https://www.iea.org/news/clean-energy-demand-for-critical-minerals-set-to-soar-as-the-world-pursues-net-zero-goals?ref=hir.harvard.edu) increased strain on critical mineral supply chains. For example, electric vehicles [require](https://hir.harvard.edu/not-so-green-technology-the-complicated-legacy-of-rare-earth-mining/) six times the critical mineral resources of gasoline-powered vehicles, and a wind farm demands nine times the mineral input of a similarly sized natural-gas plant.

Experts [expect](https://www.iea.org/news/clean-energy-demand-for-critical-minerals-set-to-soar-as-the-world-pursues-net-zero-goals?ref=hir.harvard.edu) the pressure on global supply chains to increase with the growing political support for the green transition and the market viability of renewable energy technologies. For example, [limiting](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ffd2a83b-8c30-4e9d-980a-52b6d9a86fdc/TheRoleofCriticalMineralsinCleanEnergyTransitions.pdf#page=48) global warming to two degrees Celsius—a goal commonly used by climate scientists—would quadruple global demand for minerals critical to renewable energy systems. And [achieving](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ffd2a83b-8c30-4e9d-980a-52b6d9a86fdc/TheRoleofCriticalMineralsinCleanEnergyTransitions.pdf#page=48) global net-zero carbon emissions would require supply equally six times current consumption of these minerals.

Ironically, the growth in demand for critical minerals [presents](https://www.iea.org/reports/sustainable-and-responsible-critical-mineral-supply-chains) serious environmental challenges. Critical mineral mining and processing [is](https://ccsi.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/docs/our%20focus/extractive%20industries/CCSI_2018_-_The_Renewable_Power_of_The_Mine__mr_.pdf#page=17) energy-intensive and highly dependent on fossil fuels. Merely scaling up existing practices would vastly [increase](https://ccsi.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/docs/our%20focus/extractive%20industries/CCSI_2018_-_The_Renewable_Power_of_The_Mine__mr_.pdf#page=18) carbon emissions from critical mineral mining, undermining the goals of the green transition. In addition, widely used mining methods [produce](https://hir.harvard.edu/not-so-green-technology-the-complicated-legacy-of-rare-earth-mining/) great quantities of toxic waste, including dust, waste gas, wastewater, and radioactive residue. These methods also [consume](https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-nevada/not-just-nevada-lithium-is-draining-water-across-the-world-study-reveals-3103188/) vast amounts of water, raising general concerns about groundwater pollution. Concerns about water use [are](https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-nevada/not-just-nevada-lithium-is-draining-water-across-the-world-study-reveals-3103188/) especially pronounced in the arid regions where critical minerals are often mined, such as lithium in Nevada and parts of South America.

Experts [explain](https://ccsi.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/docs/ccsi-circular-economy-mineral-renewable-energy.pdf) that fulfilling the environmental promises of renewable energy will require improvements in critical mineral mining and processing practices. But, they [note](https://hir.harvard.edu/not-so-green-technology-the-complicated-legacy-of-rare-earth-mining/), it will also require recycling and reusing mineral-dependent products, such as lithium batteries and solar panels.

Western policymakers [view](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LTRC_ChinaSupplyChain.pdf#page=8) dependence on minerals sourced from China—which dominates all levels of the global supply chain for nearly all critical minerals—as an economic and national security vulnerability. Many policymakers and scholars also [raise](https://www.cato.org/commentary/green-energy-not-so-green) concerns that China’s reliance on coal-fired power and its lenient approach to environmental regulation will worsen the environmental costs of critical earth mining and processing. And ongoing Chinese efforts to [secure](https://earth.org/rare-earth-mining-has-devastated-chinas-environment/?ref=hir.harvard.edu) exclusive mining rights worldwide, especially in Africa, are likely to intensify existing national security and environmental concerns.

Accordingly, policymakers increasingly [call for](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/us-governance-critical-minerals) the United States and its allies to diversify supply chains by increasing domestic and foreign investment in critical minerals. With demand reaching unprecedented levels, many [argue](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/us-governance-critical-minerals) that these efforts are vital to ensure national security and reliable, sustainable governance over the global critical mineral supply. But the feasibility of these efforts is [uncertain](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-has-big-plans-for-climate-and-energy-policy-but-can-he-implement-them/), given the possible conflict between President Donald J. Trump’s promises to scale back federal investment in renewable energy development and his protectionist, anti-China trade stance.

In this week’s Saturday Seminar, scholars discuss the critical mineral supply chain and the global shift to renewable energy.

* In a [report](https://www.csis.org/analysis/elevating-role-critical-minerals-development-and-security) for the [Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://www.csis.org/), [Daniel F. Runde](https://www.csis.org/people/daniel-f-runde) and [Austin Hardman](https://www.csis.org/people/austin-hardman) argue that achieving the energy transition and securing national security amid the projected spike in demand for critical minerals requires a comprehensive federal response. Noting that at least six federal agencies are involved in drafting mining regulations, Runde and Hardman [propose](https://www.csis.org/analysis/elevating-role-critical-minerals-development-and-security) designating a lead agency to create a comprehensive federal plan for critical minerals. This approach would avoid “duplicative or clashing” critical mineral policy agendas, [suggest](https://www.csis.org/analysis/elevating-role-critical-minerals-development-and-security) Runde and Hardman. Streamlined federal control, they [argue](https://www.csis.org/analysis/elevating-role-critical-minerals-development-and-security), would facilitate increased domestic mining and processing while laying a stronger foundation to pursue international partnerships.
* In a [report](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/7771525c-856f-45ef-911d-43137025aac3/SustainableandResponsibleCriticalMineralSupplyChains.pdf) for the [International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/about), [C. Michaels](https://www.iea.org/contributors/kc-michaels), [Alexandra Hegarty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandra-hegarty-556205b6/?originalSubdomain=fr), and [Joyce Raboca](https://www.iea.org/contributors/joyce-raboca) recommend enhancing supply-chain transparency and directing public spending to improve environmental, social, and governance practices in critical mineral extraction and processing. Transparency increases both the reputational benefits of good corporate practice and the reputational costs of bad practice at all levels of the critical mineral supply chain, Michaels, Hegarty, and Raboca [explain](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/7771525c-856f-45ef-911d-43137025aac3/SustainableandResponsibleCriticalMineralSupplyChains.pdf#page=21). They [argue](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/7771525c-856f-45ef-911d-43137025aac3/SustainableandResponsibleCriticalMineralSupplyChains.pdf#page=23) that combining reputational incentives with robust public financing, such as renewable resource development tax credits, would motivate corporations to create an economically and environmentally sustainable critical mineral supply chain.
* In a recent [report](https://ccsi.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/docs/ccsi-circular-economy-mineral-renewable-energy.pdf) published by the [Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment](https://ccsi.columbia.edu/), [Perrine Toledano](https://ccsi.columbia.edu/directory/perrine-toledano), [Martin Dietrich Brauch](https://ccsi.columbia.edu/directory/martin-dietrich-brauch), and [Jack Arnold](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacknarnold/) of [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) discuss how to achieve circularity in the critical mining sector by recycling and reusing critical mineral resources to minimize environmental footprints. Toledano, Brauch, and Arnold [examine](https://ccsi.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/docs/ccsi-circular-economy-mineral-renewable-energy.pdf#page=11) circularity approaches in nine countries, noting that few have dedicated policies to encourage or achieve circularity in critical mineral use. To address this shortfall, they [recommend](https://ccsi.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/docs/ccsi-circular-economy-mineral-renewable-energy.pdf#page=11) that governments strengthen their regulatory frameworks, expand research and development funding, and implement better critical-mineral use monitoring systems. Toledano, Brauch, and Arnold [conclude](https://ccsi.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/docs/ccsi-circular-economy-mineral-renewable-energy.pdf#page=4) that achieving circularity in mining activities is crucial to reaching the Paris Agreement goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
* In a [report](https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/updated-mining-footprints-and-raw-material-needs-for-clean-energy) for the [Breakthrough Institute](https://thebreakthrough.org/), researcher [Seaver Wang](https://thebreakthrough.org/people/seaver-wang) and several coauthors explore the debate over clean energy’s environmental impact. The Wang team [points out](https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/updated-mining-footprints-and-raw-material-needs-for-clean-energy) that technological innovations have greatly improved the efficiency of renewable energy systems, including by reducing material requirements for solar panels and offshore wind turbines. Wang and his coauthors [argue](https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/updated-mining-footprints-and-raw-material-needs-for-clean-energy) that recycling programs and regulations promoting longer lifespans for clean energy technologies could further reduce critical mineral demand. They [conclude](https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/updated-mining-footprints-and-raw-material-needs-for-clean-energy) that although room for improvement remains, the cumulative environmental footprint of renewable energy sources is already significantly smaller—two and twenty times smaller, respectively—than that of coal and gas.
* A recent [report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106395.pdf) by the [S. Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/) (GAO) urges the United States to diversify its sources of critical minerals, recommending increased reliance on nontraditional sources such as the byproducts of critical mineral extraction, processing, and use. GAO [notes](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-106395) that these byproducts include mining waste and wastewater, as well as byproducts of coal and geothermal power production. GAO [suggests](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-106395) policies such as tax credits and good Samaritan legislation to encourage the extraction of critical minerals from nontraditional sources while offering protection from environmental liabilities. Ultimately, GAO [argues](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-106395) that this approach would reduce dependence on foreign suppliers and limit the net environmental harms of critical mineral use.
* In an [article](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-framework-for-federal-mining-reform-impact-planning-benefits-sharing-and-asset-based-revenue-management/) for the [Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/), [Mark Haggerty](https://www.americanprogress.org/people/haggerty-mark/), [Jackson Rose](https://www.americanprogress.org/people/jackson-rose/), and [Toni Ruth](https://www.americanprogress.org/people/toni-ruth/) explain that many mining zones, including areas where critical minerals are mined, function as “extractive economies” that fail to benefit local communities. The authors [recommend](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-framework-for-federal-mining-reform-impact-planning-benefits-sharing-and-asset-based-revenue-management/) federal policy inventions such as early impact planning to prevent unexpected infrastructure crises, community benefit agreements to diversify local economies, and asset-based revenue management to ensure economic and community stability. Haggerty, Rose, and Ruth [argue](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-framework-for-federal-mining-reform-impact-planning-benefits-sharing-and-asset-based-revenue-management/) that federal policymakers can draw inspiration from state efforts, including Montana’s [Hard-Rock Mining Impact Act](https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/mca/title_0900/chapter_0060/part_0030/sections_index.html), which helps individuals in mining zones to negotiate with mining companies, and the mineral tax that Montana imposes on mining companies to replenish community funds.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

***The Following are my speculations on what the outputs for Rare Earths would be. (Note we are still waiting for that ""Early as Possible F.S.""?***

***Calculations were completed using a mine life of 36 years and a Scandium price of $2,500 (Noting that only 30 tons per year are sold until the market develops. Using most recent C.M. pricing.***

***NOTE: CAPEX is estimated high at $1.8 Billion & may be a bit lower...  Final outstanding shares calculated were for 50 million shares outstanding (Pie in the sky) & \*\*200 million shares outstanding. \*\*\*(Which is closer to MP Materials outstanding share count!)***

***Also sharing a comparison with MP Materials.***

# Have Fun running your own numbers!

**1. Updated Revenue Estimates (Annual)**

Estimating only **30 tons of scandium** per year will be sold initially, we will adjust the revenue from scandium accordingly. Until market catches up with demand....

**Niobium (5,000 tons/year):**

* 5,000 tons/year x 1,000 kg/ton x $45/kg = **$225 million/year**

**Neodymium/Praseodymium (600 tons/year):**

* 600 tons/year x 1,000 kg/ton x $90/kg = **$54 million/year**

**Terbium (24 tons/year):**

* 24 tons/year x 1,000 kg/ton x $650/kg = **$15.6 million/year**

**Dysprosium (120 tons/year):**

* 120 tons/year x 1,000 kg/ton x $450/kg = **$54 million/year**

**Titanium (TlCl4) (12,000 tons/year):**

* 12,000 tons/year x $4,500/ton = **$54 million/year**

**Scandium (30 tons/year) (Adjusted for sales): As market develops into 110T under contract the annual revenues increase!!**

* 30 tons/year x 1,000 kg/ton x $2,500/kg = **$75 million/year** (for scandium sales)

**Total Revenue Estimate**:  
$225M (Niobium) + $54M (Neodymium/Praseodymium) + $15.6M (Terbium) + $54M (Dysprosium) + $54M (Titanium) + $75M (Scandium sales) = **$477.6 million/year**.

**2. Operating Costs (OPEX) & Capital Expenditures (CAPEX)**

* **OPEX**: Still assuming **25% of revenue** for operating costs:
   * 25% of **$477.6 million** = **$119.4 million/year** OPEX.
* **CAPEX**: Remains at the previous estimate of **$1.8 billion** for the project’s initial capital expenditures.

**3. NPV Calculation (with 36-year mine life)**

Now, let’s recalculate the NPV with this revised sales volume and adjusted revenue:

* **Discount rate**: 10% (standard for these types of projects).
* **Pre-Tax NPV**: With the reduced scandium sales, the pre-tax NPV will likely be closer to **$3.5-4.5 billion**.
* **Post-Tax NPV** (considering 45X tax credits and Nebraska credits): The post-tax NPV could rise to **$5.5-6.5 billion**.

**4. Share Price Estimates (for different shares outstanding)**

**For 50 million shares outstanding:**

* **Post-Tax NPV of $5.5 billion** ÷ 50M shares = **$110/share**

**For 200 million shares outstanding:**

* **Post-Tax NPV of $5.5 billion** ÷ 200M shares = **$27.50/share**

**Updated Summary:**

* **Annual Revenue** (with 30 tons of scandium sold): **$477.6 million/year**
* **OPEX**: **$119.4 million/year**
* **Pre-Tax NPV**: **$3.5-4.5 billion**
* **Post-Tax NPV**: **$5.5-6.5 billion**
* **Share Price (50 million shares outstanding)**: **$110/share**
* **Share Price (200 million shares outstanding)**: **$27.50/share**

**MP MATERIALS Share Price Estimates (Based on 2024 projections) Compared to NIOCORP:**

Let’s assume we are comparing based on the projected **post-tax NPV** for both companies, using **50 million shares outstanding** for Niocorp and **165 million shares outstanding** for MP Materials (as of their latest share count).

If Intermittent Fasting works primarily by reducing calories, a small amount of milk in coffee shouldn't make much difference. But some people say that going ""clean"" makes sticking to their fasts much easier and leads to quicker weight loss.

1ic0lgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/1ic0lgc/to_anyone_considering_becoming_a_post_production/,To anyone considering becoming a Post Production Runner (UK only),"Good evening fellow editors 

  
I am a freelance editor and cinematographer who have mainly specialised in short form content and cooperate editing and ran my own freelance services. I am enjoying it. I get new clients quite consistently and I have a lot of creative freedom to incorporate Motion graphics in After Effects and Colour grading in DaVinci Resolve, I have a strong network of sound designers, cinematographers and writers I collaborate with when I or them need assistance. 

However, My big plan at first was to get into long form unscripted TV Post Production as I always dreamed of working on tv shows. After graduating University, I put my freelance services on hold and started working as a runner at a Soho based end to end facility this autumn after graduating University. 

I did enjoy the nature of a runner position, However it felt like a VERY slow approach to getting to my goal as a TV editor.

Runners most likely in the UK earn minimum wage and most of them are located in London (UKs most expensive city when it comes to cost of living). Runners Complete hospitality duties like serving coffee and running errands like delivering hard drives. At the post house I worked, I was also required to basically do the receptionists job and coordinate bookings when short staffed (All the time). 

As you guys can tell, there isn't much actual editing happening, at my place, I was offered paid training but could only do about 5 hours a week. The rest had to be done in my own time unpaid. 

This to many may sound like a terrible deal when YouTube editors or freelancers with less experience make 2x as much at least and just do what they enjoy but as a runner, I was told by everyone that ***'As a runner, your showing the company your loyalty by doing crappy jobs because you're passionate about being promoted and learn'***

I believed it and took as many training sessions I could get as I was eager to succeed and came in on my days of, spent my lunches being trained etc and literally practiced the AVID workflow in my own time. I also did EVERYTHING when as a runner, covered people on sick days, Made sure all duties and the facilities were top less clean and make clients more satisfied than ever thinking that all my efforts will be paid off in the long term as HR and the senior team will notice my efforts and then hopefully promote me. 

**2 weeks ago I was laid off along with 3 other runners due to 'Budget cuts' while producers and the CEO took a larger salary for themselves.** 

Anyone else with experience in the UK unscripted tv industry, please be more than welcome to share your story

1ic0fw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ic0fw7/overly_insecure_or_is_something_off_in_my/,"Overly insecure, or is something off in my relationship? 33M 34F","I'm a male in my early 30s, and I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 8 months. The first 3 months were perfect. She told me she loved me 2 months into the relationship, and I reciprocated. She talked about children, marriage, and how she felt it was “destiny” that her previous toxic relationships led her to me.

About 6 months ago, she was officially diagnosed with burnout, and since then, our relationship has changed. While she is affectionate and wants to spend a lot of time with me (almost every day), her moods can vary—sometimes and then she spends at most 2 days, saying that she has a lot to do at home. Intimacy has also decreased. In the beginning, sex was frequent and passionate, but now it happens maybe twice a week, sometimes not at all. She says it’s because it hurts her at times due to the size, but I also noticed her enthusiasm has changed—she’s no longer as vocal or engaged as before.

I try to show my love and effort. I cook breakfast for her in bed when she stays over, buy her flowers biweekly, and give her small, thoughtful gifts, and obviously from time to time genuine complements. I keep track of what she likes and listen when she vents. We’ve been on two vacations together. But when it comes to me sharing or opening up, I don’t feel truly heard. She often cites her ADHD as the reason for her distraction, which I know is real and challenging for her, but it feels like an excuse when I’m trying to connect. She’s said she’ll work on it, and she has tried, but it’s inconsistent.

What bothers me most is some white lies I’ve noticed. For example, she told me she was celibate for years before our relationship, but I later found out (after snooping, I’ll admit) that she went on a vacation with another guy she had dated during that time. I don’t understand why she lied about it—it feels unnecessary.

Early in our relationship, we agreed that flirting or chatting online with clear intentions is emotional cheating. I recently checked her DMs (again, I know this wasn’t right), and I found a conversation where a guy complimented her, called her cute, and asked if she was single. She replied “thanks” and, when asked again, said “yes” to being single. She claimed it was a misunderstanding due to English not being her native language, which could be plausible, but I’m stuck on how quickly and enthusiastically she replied to him—using emojis and having a back-and-forth conversation. She never responds to me that quickly or engages in live chats like that. She hasn’t deleted this guy from Instagram either, which bothers me. Granted we talk daily on the phone at least an hour if we don't see each other. 

She’s the first person who’s tried to boost my confidence, telling me it’s a pity I don’t see myself the way she sees me and that I’m handsome. Still, I have trust and insecurity issues, and situations like these make me spiral.

There are other things that raise questions for me. She told me she paid for a service to scrape her online data but didn’t explain why. She’s lost a lot of friends in the past few years, which she attributes to them being jealous or narcissistic. I sometimes wonder if she might be a covert narcissist herself. At the same time, she trusts me immensely—I have the password to her phone, laptop, and even her bank account. She often asks for my advice at work and relies on me for help, which sometimes overwhelms me because someone is relying so much on me. I don't understand why someone would trust so much or give up so much autonomy.

Yet, I sometimes feel like an accessory or someone useful for the moment. When I try to talk about my feelings or share something personal, it feels like it doesn’t matter to her. This has led me to stop opening up as much because, honestly, what’s the point if I’m not being heard?

My mother has also noticed a change in me. She told me that when I visited with my girlfriend, I didn’t seem like myself—she said I looked “hypnotized” and thinks my girlfriend might be manipulating me.

Another thing that’s been on my mind is her appearance. She’s gained around 5kg since we started dating and doesn’t seem to try as hard to look good for me—or even for herself—like she did in the beginning. It’s not about the weight itself but more about the lack of effort, which seems to mirror other areas of the relationship where she’s stopped putting in as much energy. But she is still sexy to me and I always tell her whenever she asks me or jokes that we are like beauty and beast 

Financially, I cover most of the expenses, though she occasionally treats me to small things like coffee or pizza. She doesn’t demand to go out or spend money, and she’s mentioned that she values having a strong man who can lead and calm her down.

I’m trying to figure out if my feelings of insecurity and mistrust are rooted in my own issues, or if they’re valid based on her behavior. On one hand, she’s open with her passwords and seeks my advice, but on the other, her inconsistency, past lies, and hot-and-cold behavior leave me feeling unsure.

Am I overanalyzing this, or is there something deeper going on here?


TL:DR
I've been in an 8-month relationship that started great, but since my girlfriend's burnout diagnosis, her effort, intimacy, and consistency have declined, leaving me feeling unheard and undervalued. I've discovered some lies and questionable behavior, including a DM where she told someone she was single, though she claims it was a misunderstanding. While she trusts me with her passwords and relies on me for support, Sometimes feel like an accessory rather than a priority, and I'm questioning whether my insecurities are clouding my judgment or if there's a deeper issue.

He finally asked yesterday if I wanted to come over to his place and chill. Said we can order food, watch movies, and just hang out.

I wanna believe he's coming from a good place, but I don't wanna put myself in some kinda sketchy situation. Today, he has been hitting me up, seeing if I've decided, and making me feel kinda pressured.

About a year ago i (f24 from france) met a guy (m24 from france) with whom i clicked instantly and we laughed a lot and it felt like he was my best friend but we also had feelings for each other. Everything was perfect in the beginning. He was all i ever dreamed of and we did a lot of fun things. After a while he moved an hour away due to work and since then he wasn't putting any effort in our relationship anymore. I offered to visit him a couple times but there was always an excuse why that won't work. He only visited me once but he hung out with his friends most of the time. 

During that time (we weren't officially together and we also haven't really talked about what we are yet) I started talking to one of my coworkers (m26 from usa) and it turned out that we have a connection. He's the sweet and kind guy that walks me home, brings me coffee and compliments me. We also have so many things in common and have the same worldview. It was very easy to fall for him. 

After a week i met up with guy number 1. We talked about what we are and all that stuff. The outcome of that conversation was that he's not ready for a committed relationship and that he wants to ""enjoy his twenties"". He's also gonna go travelling for half a year soon so we would have to do language distance. I realised he's not mature enough for me/ not enough in love and that i should move on. 

Only a few weeks after i got together with my current boyfriend (guy number 2) and since then we have a happy relationship. He treats me very well and is the kinds guy that would do anything for me. We don't laugh as much and don't have as much fun as i had with guy number one but i never noticed that or thought it was that bad. We have the same worldview and are so similar in many different topics. Since he's not from the same country as me and only stayed here for one year we had around 3-4 months together before we had to go into Long distance. It has been hard but worth it so far. I met his family an he has met mine. He still treats me very well and our communication i better than i could've ever imagined. 

Lately i keep thinking more about guy number 1. and what would've happen if i didn't give up as quickly. If i'd laugh more and if it would've been easier. Especially because my current partner doesn't speak my language and i can express myself and joke around way better in my mother language. I don't wanna break up with my boyfriend because i love him and i don't think I could ever find someone else that is so mature and so good to me and loves me for who i am. I do think about my future tho and i don't wanna marry someone one day thinking about another guy. But at the same time i don't wanna ruin my current, very healthy relationship by texting him or reaching out to know how i feel. 

Everything tells me that guy number 1 is a red flag and it would've be a toxic love but I'm somehow scared i made the wrong decision. Please don't judge me for my actions and for what i'm thinking. I appreciate any help. Maybe someone had a similar situation. Can i get over that and move on with my boyfriend?",1,1738066804.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code: \

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
- Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
- The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
- Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.\
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.\
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.\
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.\
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.\
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.\
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.\
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.\
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
- Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
- It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
- Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes \
- Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
- Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
- Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
- Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.\
- Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.\
Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.\
- Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.\
Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
