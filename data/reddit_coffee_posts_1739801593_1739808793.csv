Neither of us care to gamble, just going for the food and to get away/relax. I’m an ambulatory wheelchair user. (I can walk, just not a lot.) I also have COPD and am triggered by cigarette smoke, which I’m concerned about. 

Is the monorail difficult with a wheelchair? 

What’s the best option for a basic cup of coffee in the morning?

1irne9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1irne9a/how_do_you_get_over_being_cheated_on/,How do you get over being cheated on?,"In May 2023 I split from my boyfriend of a year after I learnt he also had a girlfriend. With him I was the happiest I’d been in a long time. He was kind, gentle, intelligent, caring, everything I could ever want from a dude. I trusted him 100% and the concept of him cheating never even crossed my mind. We’re both college students (first met in a class), our campus has a food court that one day I was meeting some friends in. He was done with classes for the day and I invited him to join us, he accepted but asked to bring another class friend along, I hadn’t met the friend but obviously saw no issue with it. Him and the friend sit down with us, the conversation keeps flowing until the ‘friend’ mentions one of my boyfriend’s housemates was knocking on his bedroom door when he was asleep. His face went red and began making clear attempts to change the subject. I sensed this and when we left I asked who she was and how she knew someone was knocking on his door. He said she’d just been over helping him with an assignment and slept in his room as she lived far away. I could tell this wasn’t the full story and after a bit of internet stalking managed to find the girl’s Instagram and dropped her a message. She spilled the full story: they’d been together for eight months, she had no idea he was also into guys or of my existence. He told me two nights a week (often more) he had to attend meetings for a society he was part of, turns out he’d left the society when they got together and the ‘meetings’ were him going to see her. I was completely broken. Everything I’d been believing for the past year was a lie. I’ve had a difficult time with self esteem and perception since middle school (I was very obviously gay in a very uptight, masculine all-boys school, need I say more?), my relationship with him was the first time I truly began to feel like I was genuinely healing and moving on. That was all gone overnight.

Since then I’ve developed an intuition to question everything when meeting dudes. I cannot convince myself I’m worthy of love or that anyone can be seriously attracted to me, hence anyone with some interest must just be wanting someone out of me and/or will hurt me in the long run. It’s ruined my sex drive, as much as I can be turned on my mind then immediately turns me off out of fear. I tried hooking up with a few guys after we broke up but couldn’t get past that feeling, and I’d just leave feeling embarrassed that I didn’t satisfy the other guy enough. I slept with one person in 2024 and since then haven’t even bothered with ‘dating’ apps or any form of going out and meeting new people. It’s made me reclusive and lonely, I’m aware of the feeling and want to get rid of it, but I can’t get past the first stages of doing so.

I’m at college in Massachusetts but grew up in South Carolina where my family still live. I go back there when semesters have finished and have a job with a small(ish) local company which I do for the time I’m back. Last time I went back for longer than a weekend was at Christmas, my company holds a Christmas party every year which I always attend. Before getting with my ex I’d hooked up with a guy who worked for the same company but in a different department and office, we got on well but I hadn’t spoken to him since then. He recognised and approached me and we quickly hit it off again. After everyone had left I decided to send him a text saying it was nice to see him again, he immediately responded and we’ve kept speaking ever since, we’ve also met a few times (he works night shifts so we couldn’t find time for any further hookups), he’d drop coffee and snacks off at my office on days I was in a bad mood. He was pulling all the right moves and I’ve since caught quite deep feelings for him. On a drunken night I confessed that and he said he felt the same way, we both agreed however we hadn’t properly known each other long enough to jump into anything but would be open to it in the future.

A few weeks pass and I’m back at college. A couple days in he surprises me saying he’s purchased flights to come and visit me for a few days around Valentine’s Day. I’m over the moon and start to feel myself at least shrugging off my doubts about myself, but they’re still prevalent. As his arrival gets closer those doubts take hold of my mind and I’m back again questioning what his real intentions are. When he arrives I’m incredibly nervous (and I think that came across) and we spend a couple days going off and doing cutesy little ‘coupley’ things. I didn’t mention sex on the first night as I thought perhaps a day or two to settle in to the fact he was here would calm my nerves. We start heading to sleep and he pulls me over and starts making out with me. This caught me completely off guard (he’d been saying he was tired from travelling all day - fair enough - so I assumed he wouldn’t want to anyway) and I go into internal panic mode. I’m clearly not putting much effort in, after 20 minutes he says he wasn’t enjoying it and just went to sleep. I went to the bathroom and bawl my eyes out. I get back and he’s fast asleep, the next day we both wake up and make no mention of it. I continued to enjoy the next few days with him but can’t help but feel as if it was still lingering on his mind, he seemed disappointed and as if he wasn’t enjoying himself (I’ll add he never stated this and I may well just be overthinking). On night two I’m still shaken up and decide I’ll reject if he asks to try again and leave it for another time. I get into bed however and notice he’s on Grindr talking to people. He didn’t go off and meet anyone, but I took it very personally and as a bit of a confirmation of how I feel about myself. He also never mentioned it and I believe he’s convinced I don’t know about it, I also know at least one guy from MA added him on insta and they were both texting back and forth whilst he was with me (didn’t say what was being said, may be nothing to it, but can’t help speculating). On the third night we both went out with some of my college friend, he got very drunk and I deemed it better to not try anything whilst he was in that state. The next day is his flight home.

Today’s the day after he left. We’re still speaking but I feel as if any feelings on his end are gone and I’ve ruined any chance I had. All down to my insecurity. I’m on the edge of just forgetting all about him and moving on (or at least trying to). We’ve haven’t addressed what happened, I’m not convinced it’s gonna be the response I want to hear and hence I don’t really want to hear it.

I’m posting as I assume ‘secret girlfriend’ situations are relatively common. To those who’ve been in this situation, did you have these feelings and how have you moved on/coped with them?

Really interesting mix of people who were all there for different reasons, most had done it multiple times, some of them 50+ both in the UK and abroad (Peru seemed popular).

Anyway, I tried it.  Interesting experience, could feel sensations such as drifting down or floating up and finished on a real high.

But, no visuals.  I could feel my brain desperately trying, bit like trying to force a shit.

But at least for this first time, no visuals whatsoever. 

In that sense, it worked for everyone else there in terms of visuals.

1irnbzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1irnbzh/conflicted_about_quitting_over_text/,Conflicted about quitting over text,"I basically need some confirmation that I am not making a poor decision. A couple months ago I started a new job, and for the record I am NOT a careerwoman. I am a housewife who needed a part time job so I had a little extra spending money. This position was never meant to be permanent. It's a tiny shop and I'm not making a lot hourly.

At first, I loved it. My boss is the owner of the shop and when I started she was warm, patient, and insisted upon a healthy work/life balance. SO nice and the hours were reasonable. The ~cool boss~ veneer started to fade when I told her a couple weeks in advance about the date of me and my husband's civil ceremony/wedding and she said ""Well can you maybe do that in the afternoon?"" (so she could schedule me for that day, proceeded to do so.)

This week I have been sick. This is the first time since starting that I have called out sick. Yesterday she told me if I needed to take another day off to recover to please do so because she doesn't want to catch what I have. I am not always on my phone, especially when I am with my husband on a Sunday afternoon, so 4 hours later I told her I would take another day to recover, thanked her, and let her know that I appreciated her patience. She said ""a little more notice would have been nice,"" as though she didn't offer me the day off initially or account for the fact that I might accept the extra time??

Beyond that I am essentially not allowed to take bathroom breaks. Often it is just the two of us in the shop, and while she is making product I am meant to listen for the door to open so I can greet customers. Totally understandable that I would have to limit bathroom breaks or keep them super short so I can listen out for customers, except on the days when there is a third person up front listening to the door, I STILL have to ask permission to use the restroom (she requested that I ask her or inform her) and when I do let her know, my boss is unfailingly passive aggressive or irritable even when I just need a 2 minute break to take a piss. For the record I have IBS and an overactive bladder, paired with anxiety I dread going in because I know I would rather be uncomfortable and hold it (when I'm ABLE to hold it, anyway) than have her get huffy and impatient. I have altogether stopped drinking water or coffee when I'm at work to just prevent this scenario altogether if I can.

I am a reliable worker. I always make myself available when she needs me, stay an hour past the time my shift is meant to end whenever she asks, I don't gossip or talk too much (when I do, I'm asking her about herself and how her day's going since that's her favorite topic, or complimenting the shop) and I'm never on my phone. I keep my head down and do a thorough job, yet the longer I work there the more rude and impatient she is towards me. I don't know what I'm doing wrong besides mildly inconveniencing her, but I am allergic to confrontation when it's someone this moody, so I want to quit today over text. I am still sick and I know that if I have to take another day off, she's going to be in a snappy mood and take out her frustration on me when I am eventually able to come back in, but if I bite the bullet and come in with obvious congestion and a scratchy throat she's STILL going to be annoyed.

I don't respect her enough to give her the MONTH'S notice she asked for if I ever wanted to leave, and the job isn't going to lead anywhere, so there's not any bridges I'm worried about burning.

Hi all! I want serious help please.

Imagine yourself in my shoes (that way it would be easier for me to explain my situation)

You go to a university everyday.

There are 2 main groups in your University: group A and group B. 

There is a stark hatred between those two groups.

Not everyone shows that hatred but you never know who will.

Now, you belong to group B which is less in ratio say 500:1 to group A in your University.

You know that someone somewhere is making fun of you just because you belong to the other group. It can be your friend, your classmates or someone total stranger passing by you. 

Whether you are sitting in your class, roaming outside with friends, chilling and drinking coffee with your friends... you always feel and know that someone is making fun of you and the demeaning/derogatory jokes they must be making about you, leaves you in a state of constant anxiety.

They don't make fun of you on your face but will be laughing looking at you or pass some slang when you are around which is specifically for group ""B"" people.

Now you don't have any proof of their behaviour and even if you had, they are the one in power. So complaining is not an option.

When talking about yourself, you are not very well build and you have some self doubts (like how you must be looking in those clothes etc etc). But because of these doubts and their constant mockery, you are loosing confidence and are always anxious.

Imagine walking into your favorite fast-food joint and being greeted not by a teenager texting behind the counter but by a humanoid robot with zero attitude and perfect customer service. That's not a sci-fi flick—that's coming to a reality near you soon, thanks to AI. But before we dive into our inevitable future, let's sip some coffee and talk about how artificial intelligence is not just transforming industries but is poised to revolutionize our existence altogether.

**The AI Surge: Are Humanoids the Next Workforce?**

With Tesla leading the charge, humanoid robots powered by AI are no longer just a futuristic fantasy. Within the next five years, expect your local automotive companies to jump on the humanoid bandwagon, ushering robots into everything from car manufacturing to your early morning latte run. But while AI promises efficiency and performance beyond human capabilities, it raises the question: What happens to creative jobs? Are we rendering ourselves jobless by creating our own replacements, or is AI opening doors we can't yet comprehend?

**What's in it for Us?**

You might say, ""Sure, AI can write code like nobody's business, but can it replicate human creativity?"" While it's true that 80% of jobs mostly require task execution over abstract thinking, the thin line between human creativity and AI's artistry grows thinner by the day. Soon, we might not distinguish between a robot-painted portrait and a Monet.

**Man vs. Machine: The Intelligence Arm Race**

Enter the realm of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)—a potential game-changer in bridging the gap between our organic brains and super-speed AI processes. By juicing up our mental faculties with the processing power of a supercomputer, could we finally give AI a run for its binary? Imagine scientists deciphering complex systems faster than me explaining why pineapple belongs on pizza.

**Tether's Tango with Tech: The Dawn of BrainOS**

Thankfully, Tether steps into the scene, pioneering an open-source platform called BrainOS. Just as altruistic as it sounds, Tether aims to democratize brain augmentation, ensuring these innovations benefit all and aren't hoarded by tech giants. So, instead of fearing our man-made Frankenstein, why not become enhanced versions of ourselves through ethical technology?

**The European Dilemma: Regulation or Innovation?**

Caught amidst these advancements is the regulatory juggernaut—especially in Europe. With AI regulation debates resembling philosophical round tables, is the EU sabotaging its technological edge in a bid to protect its people? Or are they playing it smart, keeping potentially chaotic AI in check?

So, here’s the million-dollar question, folks: While AI races ahead, are we enhancing our brains enough to keep pace, or are we just knitting ourselves blankets for the new world order?

I wanted to share a recent trip I took with a couple of friends, where we visited all four parks in one day (I wouldn’t recommend it unless you hate sleep and love sore feet). They had never been to Disney World before and were determined to hit all four parks, so I knew we were in for a long day.

Note: This is all with the Lightning Lane multi-pass + ILL for Cosmic Rewind.


Park One: Animal Kingdom (8:00 AM)

We arrived around 6:45 AM and ended up near the front of the non-resort rope drop group. We decided to skip Avatar, and unfortunately, in the days leading up to the trip, I couldn’t secure an ILL at a time that would work.

Ride recap:

- Everest (walk-on)
- Dinosaur (walk-on)
- It’s Tough to Be a Bug (multi-pass) -> needed that early multi pass time to work on the other parks

We grabbed a quick coffee and drove over to Hollywood Studios.


Park Two: Hollywood Studios (9:45 AM)

Ride recap:

- Smugglers Run (multi-pass)
- Rise of the Resistance (Single Rider ~ 30 min)
- Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway (multi-pass)
- Tower of Terror (~45 min)

We enjoyed a drink and relaxed for a few minutes before tackling the Tower of Terror queue.

Skyliner to EPCOT.


Park Three: EPCOT (~1:30 PM)

Ride recap:

- Soarin’ (multi-pass at about 1:55 PM - still had to wait about 20-30 minutes; the ride was definitely backed up)
- Cosmic Rewind (ILL - 7:20 PM)

Between Soarin’ and Cosmic Rewind, we FINALLY took the time to eat and sit for a while. We definitely needed the break.

We got some food from the America Smokehouse, sushi + beer in Japan, kebabs + bread/dips + pastries in Morocco, and fish and chips in England.
After some digesting and shopping, we went to our Cosmic Rewind ILL.

We really wanted to see the MK fireworks, but with our Cosmic Rewind ILL timing, it just wasn’t going to happen. One train was down, so we didn’t leave Guardians until ~8:00 PM.

Monorail to MK.


Park Four: Magic Kingdom (~8:40 PM)

Ride recap:

After Tron, we enjoyed the empty park, took some pictures, and made our way out.

Finally, we wanted to walk the Boardwalk on our way back to the car, so we took a bus to the Boardwalk Resort and walked back to the Hollywood Studios parking lot (officially in the car at 1:00 AM). I know that seems crazy after such a long day, but it was so peaceful and the perfect ending to such a chaotic day.

We had more than 40k steps and 18 miles logged by the end of the day.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Understanding how to make coffee less acidic can enhance your daily brew. Many people love their coffee but find its acidity troubling. This can lead to discomfort or even heartburn. The good news is there are ways to enjoy coffee without the burn.

By adjusting your brewing method or choosing different beans, you can lower the acidity in your cup. This guide will explore simple, effective tips to make your coffee smoother and more enjoyable. Whether you’re a coffee newbie or a seasoned drinker, these tips can help you savor your favorite drink without the unwanted side effects. Let’s dive in and make your coffee experience better!

# Choosing Low-acidity Beans

Do you want to enjoy your coffee without the unpleasant acidity? Choosing low-acidity beans can make a big difference. This guide will help you pick the right beans to enjoy a smoother cup of coffee.

# Types Of Beans

Different coffee beans have varying levels of acidity. Some beans are naturally low in acid. Knowing which types to choose can help you reduce the acidity in your coffee.

* **Arabica Beans:** These are generally less acidic than other types. Arabica beans have a smoother taste and are more flavorful. They are grown at high altitudes, which contributes to their lower acidity.
* **Sumatran Beans:** These beans are known for their earthy flavor and low acidity. They come from Indonesia, where the growing conditions produce beans that are less acidic and more full-bodied.
* **Brazilian Beans:** Brazil produces beans with a mild and nutty flavor. These beans are often used in blends to reduce acidity.

Choosing beans from these regions can help you enjoy a less acidic cup of coffee. Always check the origin of the beans to ensure they come from low-acid regions.

I’ve been experimenting with different recipes with this one. I found that the 3 pour 1:16 got me the best results with this particular coffee.

I tasted some berry notes, almost like the berries that are found at the bottom of the container that are kind of saturated. 

Overall, a good coffee. I thought I was a big fan of this. Until I got a bag of Milky Cake and that one immediately became my favorite.

I have a bag of Banana Split I’m resting. Then after that I’ll be moving on to the next roaster.

I was a bit overwhelmed by the diagnosis since it was not really what I went to doctor for.  I want in for chest pains. Was told it was an anxiety attack and I had PMDD / ADHD. Looking back I get why since it was related.  Basically the chest pains went away and i never had that level of attack again so I just ignored the advice. 

Fast forward many years and I got pregnant back to back. Between pregnancies and breastfeeding I felt normal for almost 2 years. I really did not get how bad I was.  I wish there was a pill to really give this felling without being pregnant. Yes, I know birth control, but it isn't the same.  

Once i started ovulating again I went crazy. I had no memory at all and felt out of control.  I had a hard time finding help. I eventually ended up seeing a random doctor at a walk in clinic who help me so much. He took to time to listen. Also diagnosed me with ADHD and post Partum depression. The hormones were causing my ADHD to go insane.  Since then I have managed. 

Now being 41 I am dealing with Perimenopause For some reason I did not connect the similar symptoms to my ADHD.  I am out of my mind again. I have no memory at all and I am struggling at work. I feel like I am floating and sometimes even have to watch my feet hit the ground to make sure I am walking. My meds are no longer tackling my ADHD so I had the dosage increased and it is causing my lips / face to twitch like crazy. 

I saw a specialist prior to connecting it to my ADHD and was given medication for my thyroid, some hormones like estrogen and testosterones. I also was proscribed lots of vitamins.  I think we are on the right path but I CANNOT REMEMBER TO TAKE THEM. I have timers it, it laid it next to coffee, my husband texts me and my kids even try to help. But it takes the slightest distraction to lose me.   The specialist was out of pocket so I feel spending this amount of money just to fail and feel the same  is frustrating. 

I have an appointment with my OBGYN and I feel like i need to ask for some serious action. HRT therapy but maybe take time off to really have someone force me to take it? Maybe after a week or two I will actually feel the effects to remember on my own? Is there shots or patches that I can take or someone can be responsible for giving me weekly?  My other questions, which I have asked in the past because I am so bad, is to have a full hysterectomy.  

  
What are people doing? Routines or medications? Types of doctors you have seen? Any advice is helpful? I'm really struggling and when i bring it up I am just given advice that doesn't help.

I'm sure those things will improve with practice and muscle development, but I'd also like to know if there’s any physical or mental cues that are helpful to keep in mind with trumpet embouchure while I'm playing.

Some specific embouchure questions that I can think of are:

Should I imagine that I’m trying to hold a very thin straw (like a coffee stirrer) in my lips (and the straw would be my aperture)?

Should I think about keeping my lips as taut as possible against my teeth to make my lips more ""ready to vibrate"" (like tightening a drum head or guitar string)?

Should I think about there being a ""tug of war"" between the muscles above my top lip (mustache area) and the muscles below the bottom lip (between chin and bottom lip), where those muscles are trying to pull the lips _open_? While these muscles try to pull the lips open, other muscles resist to keep them shut, making a tight surface. Is that the right way to think about it?

As I increase the pitch, should I think about rolling my bottom lip inward? Or is it more about firming up the corners? Or a combination of many things?

Should what's happening inside the cup of the mouthpiece generally look the same for most notes (with only muscles outside the cup loosening/tightening), or should my lip setup inside the cup change as well?

Is it supposed to be so tiring on the face when I'm doing it right, or might I have too much tension? My face gets tired within less than a minute of playing.

1irn1r8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubaibling/comments/1irn1r8/zeina_and_safa_are_such_evil_cruel_and_pathetic/,"Zeina and Safa are such evil, cruel and pathetic losers","I am concerned seeing how many people support Safa and Zeina. They are really mean. No, they are just downright cruel. There are way too many incidents to recount how evil they have been. I understand Zeina is a businesswoman and built a name for herself in real estate, but this gives her absolutely no right to go around terrorizing people the way she does. 

She is so beyond narcissistic and the way people side with her blindly is unnerving. Both on the show and the audience. Zeina will not keep anybody in her life unless they worship and enable her. Safa is Zeina's little lap dog. Mona will always, always, always side with Safa and Zeina. She's confronted LJ, Farhana, and Danya to get over all these various things. Like babe, Safa and Zeina, could not give two shits about you. They just care about what they can gain from you. 

Farhana does not kiss Zeina's ass and she can't handle it. Same with LJ. 

Safa and Zeina:

\*roasts Farhana since season 1 about how they don't like her events are sponsored\*

\*roasts Farhana for renting designer bags just because she brought a dust bag\*

\*calls Danya an ali baba version of her\* (that is so mean and not true) 

\*comes to LJ's party in red snake outfit for attention\*

\*both of them apologizes to absolutely nobody for anything but expects five apologies and not even accepting it in the end\*

\*in the most unclassy way, starts shouting in front of everyone that Bliss and Danya rent cars and they're not that rich\*

\*Nonironically does a Lamborghini funeral\*

\*Tells LJ she has no real friends\* 

\*Constantly telling Farhana she wants attention\* (um shut the fuck up Safa. you want attention just as much.) 

\*Poaches Farhana's sponsors but won't admit to it\* 

They start shit every single place they go. In my view, Farhana was the classy one at Ibrahim's event. Safa brings a dustbag to mock Farhana because Farhana just will avoid spaces Safa is in at this point. Farhana does not respond. She stays silent. That is classy of her despite how humiliating that is. Then Farhana doesn't react... So Zeina brings a toy car Ferrari and passes it off as a joke? Fuck you Zeina. That is so insulting. That is not a joke. She's forcing Farhana to accept it and loses it when she won't. I mean seriously think about it. Zeina went to the store or amazon or whatever to buy a mini red ferrari for Farhana to humiliate her? That is so pre-meditated and crazy. 

After that, Farhana responds. AS SHE FUCKING SHOULD. They keep pushing Farhana to her limits. Then Mona (totally spineless) is asking Farhana if it's right that she went around asking about the car. Um, where is the same energy for Safa and Zeina literally the ENTIRE show? Safa trashes Danya and Bliss for absolutely no reason saying they rent cars. Why didn't Mona confront Safa? Because she's a loser. Why didn't Mona confront Safa and Zeina about renting the bags? Because she's a loser. 

Then why did Mona ask who Farhana prefers more - LJ or Jawana? Why would someone ask such a classless question? Then Jawana plays victim and starts howling. But the question is, why did Jawana go behind LJ's back first? I see her point of view. No, LJ didn't have to respond with the same unkindness. No, Farhana doesn't have to respond with the same unkindness with the ferrari. But it's just so gaslight-y to keep blaming the people who are defending themselves against the instigators. 

In my view, both Farhana and LJ have been far more peaceful than the others. Zeina even threw the coffee at Danya first and Danya cried and apologized. You'll never ever hear an apology coming out of Zeina's mouth. 

She's only acting calm about Ibrahim because he has collateral over her with the trademark registration. He actually has an upper hand for once. Otherwise, she would be her trashy high and mighty self again. 

I feel so bad that mahira keeps forcing Farhana to let her stupid ex husband introduce Aydin to his girlfriend. I've seen people in this group saying that's immature of her. Put yourself in her shoes. If you were married and that person left you for someone else, left you to take care of your child for five years, started calling the person you cheated with your child's mother, why the hell would you let your child even one foot close to that woman? Mahira is projecting her inability to move on from the divorce onto Farhana because I think she's scared it'll take as long as Farhana to move on. But guess what? Divorces are HARD. Healing is not linear. You won't heal just by throwing a butterfly party. 

Anyway, I agree with Danya that everyone is just ganging up on Farhana and I don't know why because it is so obvious who started it there. Farhana is not without her faults either. She can be cringe as she was on her dates. 

I think the only one who has grown was Danya and LJ. LJ keeps her distance from negative influences. That's also why Zeina keeps interfering in LJ and Jawana's friendship. She doesn't even know Jawana but she wants to know why all this happened because she can't accept that LJ has chosen not to kiss Zeina's ass. She was finding a way to take LJ down. She is a fucking snake and Safa is her low intellect minion without a brain of her own. 

Zeina has such a control over Safa that Safa was scared to tell Zeina. Zeina is so full of herself that if anyone falls out of line a little bit, she will ice them out. Where is the self reflection on your guys's end?! I genuinely want to understand why people support Zeina. I get that she seems composed/she is a businesswoman but she is actually so evil and unclassy. Money can't buy class. 

I hate when people corner one person like that, especially when it was obviously Safa and Zeina from the beginning instigating fights with LJ, Farhana, Danya, Ibrahim (I hate Ibrahim too), Lojain. Remember when Zeina was mad that Lojain hung out with Farhana, LJ, Danya, and Ibrahim and went to her house asking her why she would do that? 

TLDR: Anyone who does not kiss Zeina's butthole is her #1 enemy. Safa is her lackey. They are two really mean, cruel bullies.

4. Being rude to J and I, sort of treating us like we're stupid (mainly he did this to J, but he's done it to me too) and just being rude to me (like when I don't do certain things he gets a tone so to speak)
Our manager asked us about these things a few days ago and said she noticed it too, citing how a reason they (the owners, mainly M and his wife) even hired C is because ""she's pretty"". She said she has to document these things. I've sort of been wondering how much she can even do considering M is everyone's boss and literally owns the place. I'm not sure about our manager, but my coworkers and I are nervous to bring anything up to him because we don't want to get fired.
Slightly related: I'm a (closeted at work) trans man. I'm sure most if not all of my coworkers would be supportive or neutral about me transitioning, which is what I'm planning to do very soon. However, M is a trump supporter and I'm unsure if this is a safe place to do so. My sister already thinks that he might suspect I'm trans (again I'm closeted, so it may be based off my dress and hair) and is being rude to me because of that (and the fact that I'm Hispanic). I've applied to another job, so there's hope there, but if I stay at this job then I have to deal with M.
If anyone could give me advice for either situations, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",0,1739807606.0,AskHR,1,0.5,False
1irmz2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autism_Parenting/comments/1irmz2o/snow_days/,Snow days,"Not really a vent or a discussion, just an observation this morning. 

We’ve had a lot of snow… way more snow than normal. the schools were closed for a couple of days last week and they are closed today, I can’t see them being open tomorrow. There is literally 4 feet of snow in front of my house, even if the schools reopen, I’m not sure when the city will clear our street, so we’re hunkered down for a few days. 

I looked out the window this morning while I was making myself a coffee, I saw the nieghbours kids, who are the same age as mine, in their garden, playing and amusing themselves… It made me think of my own childhood, I remember getting snow and it being such an amazing experience (I lived in the UK and now live in Canada), I remember me and my brother playing outside in the snow for hours… building forts and snowmen… 

My kids just aren’t interested. It’s not even on their radar. Even if they wanted to wrap up and go outside, it would last 5 minutes and then they’d want to come back inside. I will need to shovel at some point and I’ll ask my eldest to help but the winter and snow is such a non event for them.

In the summer however, they are constantly outside, so I wonder if it’s a warmth thing (it’s f\*cking cold tbh) or the amount of clothes… I dunno… 

anyway… back to watching the gruffalo on repeat :-) ",1,1739807590.0,Autism_Parenting,0,1.0,False

It was never really assessed by my psychiatrists or doctors because they’d rather treat my other problems than bulimia as of now. I’m a bigger person but I’ve been losing weight rapidly since the past 4 months. I do not binge eat or overeat. I just puke anything that comes into my system typically… 
I had also only been scarfing down a ton of pills instead of food most days. Like a lot of Tylenol, lots of Sleep Aid, Naltrexone and Excedrin. 

But it’s getting bad, I don’t know what I’m doing to myself but it sucks. Everyday I’ve started to get a headache and feel like hell if I don’t puke. 

Yesterday, I had so much of a headache I decided that it was time to make myself throw up again. I had only eaten some pasta and a chocolate. My head and stomach were killing me. When I puked, it resembled coffee grounds. I got overly nervous and asked my bf to help. I ended up staying home and managing it myself since I feared it didn’t actually have to be a medical emergency. 

Yet ever since then, my stomach has been absolutely killing me whenever I turn, exercise, or do anything. And everytime I wake up I get a bad headache again. I know know KNOW damn well not to puke but the temptation to get rid of this sickness is major.

I have already paid for the trip and bought my plane ticket. 

Yesterday, I met with my boyfriend’s mom (who is strongly connected with her sixth sense), my sister, and my grandma. When we were sitting for coffee, his mom leaned into me and warned me that I should not get on the plane because something terrible will happen while I’m on it. She was very specific, too, mentioning that nothing will happen if I get there, or on the plane ride back, just the plane ride there. She sensed a strong danger and seemed extremely intense about it. She also mentioned that my mother, who passed away six years ago, connected with her and said that I should not go on the plane. His mother, who usually sees these visions in her dreams, saw my mom and I standing together, which she interpreted as me passing away because of a horrific accident on the flight. My sister, who is also in touch with her senses, says that she doesn’t want me to go either because she doesn’t have a good feeling about it. At this point, my whole family is begging me not to go.

While sitting and listening to all this information, I felt worried, obviously, but I didn’t have my own gut reaction to it. I think I’m going to be okay. I follow my intuition, which says that I’ll be alright, but I also think logically, and the idea of the plane disappearing over the ocean is close to none. 

I really need some advice because this seems like an incredible opportunity and something that aligns with my interests to strongly, but I obviously don’t want something to happen to me on the plane 😭

I was laying down in the mud, hidden behind a short parapet. The scenery felt like WW1 with wet tranches all around, but I had the uniform of a French WW2 soldier and was holding a good old American M1 Garand.

My surroundings were quiet at first, as I layed there waiting for the unknown. At some point, I reached the end of my patience, getting restless due to the anxiety, and took a quick peak over the sandbags covering my position. Lo and behold, the first thing I saw was a bullet exploding the head of a fellow soldier in front of me. Panic took hold of me, and all hell broke loose. I got as close to the ground as possible as bullets were zipping through the air around me, and the intense shelling was shaking the ground.

Now, many men in my family fought in multiple wars during the 20th century, and I was always told that they were glad they fought before getting married, because those who fully surrendered to the battle had a higher likelihood of surviving, because of less emotional distractions and taking more risks... But I am married, and NOT thinking about her, especially when facing a very likely death, is unthinkable to me.

So a very terrorizing and paralyzing thought melted my mind as I layed there in the mud and blood, cold and wet, cowering beneath the bullets: ""Oh my God, I'm fucked"".

Both setups are exactly the same (same size chemex, same chemex filters, very similar electric kettles), aside from the obvious difference in quality for the grinders. I stopped bringing my hand grinder to work as our coffee club has grown to quite a few people, so we have been using the office's blade grinder as it can fit the amount of beans we need for 6-8 people (~100 grams). 

Something I've noticed is that I'm still able to get quite a decent cup of coffee (most of the time) in the office using the blade grinder. This morning we brewed a medium-light roast from Eastlick coffee co (The Ace blend), which turned out pretty dang good despite the grind being horribly inconsistent (a mix of small chunks of beans, fines, coarse, and everything in between). I fully expect a grind like that to come out less than ideal, however, I was able to pick up all of the tasting notes perfectly and really enjoyed the cup. 

That being said, I still think a consistent grind is very important as most of us already know, so I'd like to upgrade our office grinder to an electric burr grinder (like the Baratza Encore) sometime soon since our coffee club is growing in popularity. But in the meantime, I'm still a little shocked that the blade grinder is still yielding a good cup.

1irml3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1irml3j/blackberry_a_legacy_stock_thats_going_to_get/,BlackBerry: A Legacy Stock That’s Going To Get Re-Rated And Run,"BlackBerry is not a dead brand. It’s not a failed smartphone company. It’s not just another stock that spikes when retail traders pile in and then disappears.

It is a deeply entrenched, high-margin infrastructure software business that has gone completely unnoticed in the AI-driven rally. While every software stock remotely connected to AI, IoT, or automation trades at sky-high valuations, BlackBerry—which powers 255M+ vehicles and counting—still trades like a company with no future.

The reality is different. BlackBerry dominates real-time, safety-critical automotive systems with its QNX operating system, and it’s now layering on a SaaS-like business with IVY, a cloud-based vehicle data platform co-developed with AWS.

IVY allows automakers to process, analyze, and monetize vehicle sensor data in real time. This is exactly the kind of AI-adjacent, cloud-powered software business that should be trading at 10x revenue, yet the market assigns it zero value.

That will not last much longer.

* QNX is embedded in 255M+ vehicles and continues to expand at 20M+ per year.
* IVY has secured early adopters, including Foxconn’s MIH EV platform, Dongfeng, and Mitsubishi Electric.
* The cybersecurity division, generating $350M–$365M annually, is now stabilized and profitable.

Every other infrastructure software business with this kind of positioning has already been re-rated higher—this one just hasn’t caught up yet.

# The Trade: BlackBerry Gets Re-Rated in the Next 2–3 Quarters—Possibly as Soon as Earnings April 2nd

QNX is growing, IVY is ramping up, and cybersecurity has stabilized, yet the stock price still reflects none of this.

* If BlackBerry provides strong IVY guidance next earnings, the re-rating could start immediately.
* Even without IVY, QNX’s backlog alone justifies a higher multiple.
* Cybersecurity, previously a drag on performance, is now quietly generating cash.

This setup provides a margin of safety with significant upside.

Even if IVY takes time to scale, QNX alone is worth more than what the market is assigning to BlackBerry today.

If the market re-rates BlackBerry as an infrastructure software business, it trades at $12–$18 in the next 2–3 quarters. That does not include IVY guidance or it's potential impact on price, which could drive the stock much higher.

# QNX: The Operating System Running Inside 255M+ Vehicles

QNX is not an infotainment OS—it’s the real-time, safety-critical software running inside automotive systems.

* Installed in 255M+ vehicles, growing by 20M+ per year
* $815M backlog (+27% YoY) ensures forward revenue visibility
* Trusted by nearly every major automaker, including BMW, Toyota, Ford, GM, Volkswagen, Honda, Stellantis, Bosch, Continental, Magna, and Denso

QNX is embedded in ADAS, digital instrument clusters, telematics, and secure gateways—systems where failure is not an option. Automakers don’t replace this kind of software lightly, which is why QNX enjoys high retention and a long revenue tail.

As vehicles become more software-driven, QNX’s role is only growing.

* Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) require real-time OS solutions that QNX already dominates
* QNX Hypervisor enables multiple systems to run securely on a single chip, increasing its value per vehicle
* EVs and autonomous systems require low-latency, high-reliability computing—exactly what QNX provides

If QNX were valued like a strategic AI-driven infrastructure software provider, it would not be trading at 5x revenue.

A more appropriate 8–10x multiple puts QNX’s valuation at $2.5B–$3.5B alone.

Right now, the market is treating QNX like a legacy asset when it’s actually growing and gaining importance.

# IVY: The Unpriced SaaS Upside That Could Change the Entire Valuation

BlackBerry IVY is a co-developed vehicle data platform with AWS that allows automakers to process, analyze, and monetize in-car data.

* Foxconn’s MIH EV platform, Dongfeng Motors, and Mitsubishi Electric have already signed on
* IVY enables software-driven revenue streams for automakers (subscriptions, upgrades, real-time analytics)
* BlackBerry captures recurring revenue from these services

Right now, the market assigns IVY zero value because revenue has not yet scaled.

But automakers are moving toward Tesla-style in-car software features, usage-based pricing, and over-the-air upgrades.

If IVY becomes the data layer that enables this shift, BlackBerry’s valuation moves toward SaaS multiples instead of just embedded software.

And we will know a lot more by next earnings.

# Cybersecurity: No Longer a Drag, Now a Cash Generator

For years, BlackBerry’s cybersecurity business was bloated and uncompetitive.

* Then management sold off Cylance, cut unnecessary costs, and focused on high-trust, high-retention government and enterprise contracts.
* Cybersecurity now generates $350M–$365M annually with a $280M ARR & Margins have improved to 65%
* Trusted by NATO, Fortune 500s, and government agencies

This is not a high-growth business, but it is a stable, profitable enterprise software business that the market is ignoring.

Even at a conservative 2–4x revenue multiple, cybersecurity alone could be worth $700M–$1.2B.

Right now, the market is treating this business as worthless, which makes no sense.

# Market Mispricing: How Big Is the Upside?

BlackBerry is currently trading at \~5x sales, significantly below comparable infrastructure software businesses.

If the market re-rates BlackBerry as a legitimate infrastructure software provider, the stock is an easy double from here.

A reasonable valuation based on its components:

* QNX at 8–10x revenue → $2.5B–$3.5B
* Cybersecurity at 2–4x revenue → $700M–$1.2B
* IVY is completely unpriced—if it scales, it could be worth billions

**This pushes BlackBerry’s fair value toward $12–$18 in the next 2–3 quarters on the low end, $20+ on the high end if IVY scales.**

If IVY guidance is strong next earnings, that re-rating could start immediately.

# Final Thought: The Market Is About to Wake Up

This is not a meme stock revival.

It is an AI-adjacent, embedded infrastructure software business that has somehow escaped the AI stock rally.

That will not last much longer.

* QNX should not be trading like a no-growth legacy product
* IVY is being assigned zero value, despite real partnerships and revenue potential
* Cybersecurity is now a stable asset, not a liability

This stock is one strong IVY earnings guide away from a re-rating to juicy SAAS multiples. BlackBerry is almost certainly about to be priced like a great software company instead of a clown show. When that happens, it’s not trading anywhere near $5.69 anymore.

**TLDR:** My analysis indicates BlackBerry is a high-margin software business that the market doesn't believe could operate a coffee cart at an airport. Their IOT businesses includes the dominant OS for automotive software and an emerging SaaS platform co-developed with AWS both of which should command high multiples. The stock trades at a massive discount to comparable AI-adjacent infrastructure software businesses. In a base case, the stock should trade at $12–$18 in the next 2–3 quarters and if IOT guidance is strong next earnings it can pop to 20+.",91,1739806580.0,wallstreetbets,71,0.8,False

They are then sun-dried on the backs of rare, ethically sourced Peruvian alpacas, ensuring optimal bean-to-alpaca contact for precisely 72 hours. I paid $450 for a mere 100 grams, a veritable steal for such a divine experience.

My in-laws arrived, and, as predicted, demanded I prepare them 'coffee.' As a beacon of hospitality, I acquiesced. My father-in-law, that barbarian, requested... cream and sugar. I paused, my hand trembling, my spirit recoiling. 'Excuse me?' I inquired, my voice barely a whisper. 'Would you dare to slather ketchup on a perfectly seared ribeye, you bean-murdering philistine?' I then proceeded to explain the nuanced flavor profile of the beans, including the subtle notes of sun-dried apricots and the lingering hint of volcanic soil, but they just stared blankly. Suddenly, I blacked out. I believe I began shrieking obscenities and reminding them I liked my ex girlfriend's parents better.  

They eventually fled, their plebeian sensibilities clearly shattered. My wife is mad at me. Did I overreact?",6,1739806435.0,espressocirclejerk,1,1.0,False

Does anyone know what happened to the Mariupol group of witnesses in Ukraine that were hiding in a cellar and trying to carry on their meetings during the onslaught on the city by Russian bombings and invasion in 2022?

I recall a brief comment in a publication or on the JW website how courageous they were standing up for Jehovah and his righteous standards (not my words)
Then we hear nothing! So what happened to the 100 or more so witnesses sheltering in a cellar? Did they lose their lives by the bombings? Detained by Russian forces or escaped to greener pastures?

1irmeh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1irmeh5/lets_talk_about_electricity/,Let's talk about electricity!,"Long story short. 

With a small backyard solar set up you could eat like you weren't living in a dystopian future. 

Solar is cheaper than ever. Battery systems are half the price that they were a year ago. A small chest freezer is $200 at Costco and it can be switched into a fridge mode and uses about 1/10 the electricity or less that of a normal fridge. An electric pressure cooker uses a fraction of the energy that normal cooking uses. An induction cook top is also relatively energy efficient and can boil water in less than two minutes.

Put those all together and you have a sustainable little kitchen in times of emergency. If we get a Tuesday and not a doomsday, the system will eventually pay for itself with not only a lower electrical bill but also saving your butt in an extended power outage by not losing all the food in your fridge or freezer.

People are talking about cooking over campfires if SHTF and how we won't have electricity for cooking or refrigeration. Unless you live in a forested area, away from the thousands or millions of other people who also need to cook and heat with wood, this is not a sustainable option. The amount of wood and land it takes to maintain even a single household is unattainable for 99.9% of us. 

We take for granted our refrigeration. Before every house was electrified they would truck in ice that was cut from lakes in the winter and stored in massive warehouses. Or you could walk 5 minutes to your local market to get farm fresh produce from the farm a few miles outside of town and a chicken that was butchered that morning. You would cook your dinner with wood delivered once a week or month to your wood shed.  Our society is no longer set up to exist without electricity. 

I don't expect total loss of electricity but I do expect power outages to become more common and longer lasting. Remember the rolling brown outs in California? I expect the natural gass piped into so many homes to be disrupted more often. I expect gas, diesel, and propane to be more and more expensive. I expect food to be less available and more sporadic and much more expensive. 

This all comes back to having solar power at least as a back up. A small system won't run your dryer and 15 cubic foot fridge. It won't heat your shower water. It won't run your gaming computer. It will charge your devices. It can run a small chest freezer and/or chest fridge. It can run a pressure cooker to cook up that rice or beans or stew. It can run the portable induction cook top to boil water in a matter of minutes to make it safe to drink or to brew a cup of coffee or warm some wash water for that sponge bath. It can run a small laptop modern with all your entertainment loaded onto it for a movie night. It will run a string of LED lights to keep your world lit on a dark night.

When food is plentiful, fill up that freezer. When sun is plentiful, cook up large meals to freeze for later. Add in some canning jars and you can make jams and high acidity foods like pickles when food is plentiful to save for times when fresh produce is scarce. If you add in an electric pressure canner you can make canned meals ready to eat on a sunny day from food stored in your freezer and produce from your garden or your neighborhood market.

I truly believe we wouldn't be able to survive without electricity in modern times. A few days here and there without power is fine. Make it a few weeks and things will start to really break down. Especially in densely populated areas. I live in the desert. There is no firewood here. Or at least not enough to sustain more than a couple of families in the valley.

I lived in a tiny trailer with 600 watts on the roof and it was enough to power everything I needed to live comfortably with access to showers at work. That was a flat mount so it was closer to 400 watts max gain. They make single panels that are 500 watts these days. One or two of those, with a battery pack that can handle the voltage and wattage gain (not all of the battery packs can handle more than a tiny bit of solar and this isn't common knowledge) and the right, energy efficient appliances, and you are golden. 

It is easier than ever to set up a system. No special knowledge or electrical skills needed. The all in one inverter/batteries often come with a wire to link directly into solar panels. Like plugging in a toaster. Some people prop up their solar panels on a fence or attach one to a balcony rail. Some solar panels are light weight and fold up so you can store them until needed or easily packed into the car for a bug out.

Long story short. Solar can go a long way to help keep you and you and/or your family healthy, fed, safe, and sane. ",10,1739806111.0,TwoXPreppers,0,1.0,False

1irmcw3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1irmcw3,What a beautiful country. I had a great trip!,"Just got home from a wonderful 12 day trip in February. Landed in Liberia, stayed there a day then travelled to La Fortuna, Monteverde, Punta Islita, Gauyabo. Basically travelled within a northwest region. I love, that I experienced different climates. It was incredible seeing the cloud forests, hot springs, volcanoes, cities and beaches. 
Before I left I kept reading that the food was bad and that I will get my car broken into… neither of those things were true. 
I don’t like busy tourists places so I tend to stay in more remote areas. La Fortuna was very touristy, but everywhere else was less so. I went with my husband and daughter. We ate at local sodas and bought groceries in between. 
The locals ticos were wonderful, friendly to chat with and very helpful. I stayed in local homes instead of resorts or hotels. We rented a 4x4 with no issues from Budget. 

In La Fortuna I did a few tours. We went to the Eco termales hot springs. It was beautiful and had a resort vibe, the water and pools were amazing. Did the 3 hour tour with North Fields coffee/chocolate tour. I had fun with my small group of people and felt that the 3 hours was nice, it was at a relaxed pace and allowed lots of people to ask great questions. 

Did a night tour with Guillermo Tours
 506-88-455588. Highly recommend Guillermo! He knew the jungle like the back of his hand. Highly knowledgeable and helped get fantastic pictures. Should be taking pictures for National Geographic! 

In Monteverde, we spent a day at Treetopia zip line park. It was fantastic! The people were professional and the park was incredible. We walked through several of the reserves and had amazing foods with great sunsets. 

Then drove through the back country on dirt roads to Punta Islita and stayed in a treehouse in the dry jungle forest. I woke to monkeys and birds travelling over top on the house every morning. The beaches were insane, and we were basically alone. We walked the shores and found old turtle nests and watched the Macaws and incredible sunsets. 

Lastly I stayed at the Animal Rescue in Guayabo. It was so great! I loved all the animals on the farm and we had a great ATV ride through the 300acre farm. I spent an evening laying in the grass, with a huge pile of puppies ontop on me, watching the sunset. We tried the 
Las Hornillas Volcano Hot Springs and covered ourselves in volcanic mud. It was so much fun. 

I loved my entire trip! I highly recommend a Costa Rican adventure. ",18,1739805996.0,CostaRicaTravel,5,0.95,False

1irmblo,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1irmblo/long_stains_on_an_uneven_surface/,Long stains on an uneven surface,"For a few years, I've had an issue where the surface of my teeth is uneven, and gunk gets stuck in the crevices and is nearly impossible to brush out. The only way to get it out is to physically scratch it out with a tookpick or nail or a dentist appointment.

I've tried not drinking coffee for a month, brushing after every meal, drinking water constantly, and it's always there. Scratching it away will only have it reform in a week, and two after a proper dental cleaning.

For some inexplicable reason, whenever I go on holiday, it fades away quickly overnight. My dental hygiene probably gets slightly worse, I use the same toothpaste and the same brush. It doesn't matter where I go, just that I'm not in the country. I don't bother trying to get it out or do anything special, but it just fades away on its own.

The only difference I narrowed down to is that I only drink mineral water overseas, and never here, since the tap here is very soft and perfectly drinkable.

Could very soft drinking water be the issue?

I've just returned from holiday, so the stains are barely visible. But I imagine that they'll get significantly worse and spread in the coming week. The canines can get especially bad and be half covered in stains, and front molars in long streaks of brown. You can see the remnants of a bad stain on the leftmost lower teeth.

She's been in assisted living for 3 years in her own apt. Building is mostly independent with a small (24 residents) memory care floor and about 70 people on AL of some degree for another. Her maladies include: severe osteoarthritis in her hips, knees, shoulders, hands with off-the-chart pain even when sitting. Off/on edema (wears TED hose). No ""diseases"" - blood work is normal. Appetite is decent. Cognitive decline but still pretty with it. Meds include Gabapentin for pain (100 mg/daily + 300 mg at night), Lexapro (10 mg) for generalized anxiety, Tylenol (max dose daily), Advil (max dose daily). We just started on the daytime Gabapentin and it's helped a little I think but made her super loopy. Nothing is truly touching the pain. Bad experience with THC/CBD. She refuses Oxy. Tramadol makes her nauseous. She can't/won't walk anymore without someone with her. She can make it to the bathroom but by the time she pushes her pendant and a caregiver comes to walk with her, she doesn't make it every time. I spend about 4 hours with her once a week (I live 90 min away and I work full time) and my sister does the same 2x a week. We have hired private care for the afternoons. She eats in her apartment (not in the dining room) and between me, my sister, and the private care, she gets help setting out her dinner. She is fine for breakfast and lunch (easy to grab and sit and eat). She doesn't do anything socially anymore and isn't interested. Ship has sailed. She sleeps a lot during the day and actually sleeps from about 10p-4a without getting up. 

She's declined a lot in the last 2 months. The walking is labored and painful. She cannot wipe herself or pull her pants up/down. Won't wear muumuus/house coats. She is having a harder time holding silverware. Can barely hold a cup to drink coffee. We've tried OT and probably need to visit this again to get her better ""tools"". May be time to introduce a commode. She has such a hard time getting up from a seat I don't see how this will work but I hope OT will help. 

We are considering moving her to the memory care floor of her building so she can get faster care. They are 3 caregivers + 1 nurse for 24 residents on that floor. The management says a caregiver can get to her faster to get her to the toilet. They do have a skilled nursing facility but MEDICALLY she doesn't need that. 

We brought in Hospice for a consult but she was declined service - not ""dying of anything"". Haven't found a palliative care program that will come to her and provide any sort of care. 

What am I missing? What am I not trying to get her out of this pain loop? What else could I do to meet my highest ideals for her (her highest too) which are COMFORT and DIGNITY? Getting her butt wiped and having accidents makes her cry. She hates this ""life"". I hate this for her too. She's existing not living. And she talks about ""going to Dad"" a lot. She has visions of ""people with her.... maybe they will come get her?

I work from home from around 7 AM to 3 PM and I get up in the morning perfectly fine, make sure im having a high protein breakfast like I see mentioned in here and every single day I start to just completely crash around 8:30 AM and doze off at my desk :/  This happens on and off for the rest of the day but even when I am not dozing off at my desk I feel like I am still super low energy that it’s affecting my entire life. I sometimes feel literally just too tired to clean and take care of housework and also affecting my job performance lately 🥲

I’m open to any advice or ideas, I am overweight so I am currently working with my PCP and a dietitian through my health insurance, but so far the only advice I’ve really been given is sticking to under 1500 calories and doing high protein, less carbs. 

Not sure if it matters for the question but just in case: currently taking Metformin 500mg once a day and some other stuff suggested to me (magnesium, b12, probiotic). I also don’t drink coffee or anything like that because I also have ADHD on top of everything else in here so caffeine actually usually makes me feel more sleepy afterwards lol

If there’s any questions or anything, I forgot to mention in here, let me know! Appreciate you all ❤️ ",1,1739805396.0,PCOS,1,1.0,False

1irm3bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1irm3bb/cupping_roasts_from_different_days_sample_roast/,cupping roasts from different days / sample roast process,"i'm starting to incorporate cupping into my home roasting cycle, but since i'm not churning out loads of coffee at once and trying to drink everything i roast, my roasts are often days or up to a week apart. do you guys have any best practices for cupping things roasted on different days, does it make that much of a difference, etc? i'm aware i probably *should* roast every sample on the same day to eliminate the variable but that leaves me with a whole bunch of coffee to drink. 

annoyingly my minimum batch size is around 200g with the skywalker v1 and even there it's quite shaky with regards to accurate temperature readings. have any home roasters got a solid sample roasting process on their normal machine to gauge where a new coffee wants to be without wasting batches at a time? can i just roast way less than 200g in the skywalker and disregard the bean probe's reading?

i seem to notice my coffees getting better up to a week or two post roast as i go pretty light. (my last papua new guinea came in at a frankly shocking 9% moisture loss, light even for me.) i'm aware waiting this long will pretty much eliminate post-roasty differences, but i can't keep waiting this long either!

these posts of mine always seem to cover too a few many areas but they're all interconnected and i'm trying to learn all this as i go. any thoughts / ideas / experiences welcome :)",3,1739805301.0,roasting,0,1.0,False
1irm2i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ENTP_women/comments/1irm2i7/entp_5w4_with_social_anxiety_isconfusing/,ENTP 5w4 with Social Anxiety is...confusing,"I got into MBTI because I remember someone suggesting me it when I told them how complicated and contradictory my personality was-- they said I might be able to understand myself better or just have fun.

I sorta liked the idea and I learnt a lot about MBTI, I'm an ENTP(debater) but...5w4 (philosopher), which is not common with ENTPs as they are usually 7wX or something like that. The reason why is the wing 5s are introverted, reserved etc, and ENTPs are already regarded as the most introverted extrovert personality types in the MBTI. 

As an ENTP girl with normal ENTP girl struggles, this is an add on because of my unstable personality what I mean is, I could be super duper socially anxious in certain situations where my knowledge is not required, like socializing with someone with no intentions of work or any professional connection, or being somewhere far apart from my cup of coffee (like a comic-on...a restaurant, a mall ill start shivering and stuff). But I also noticed that, I'm far-far away from being like this in places like MUNs (model united nations), School group projects, Presentation, Leading, Talking to higher ups or people WHO REALLY matter about complex things, I wont stutter, I'm straight to point, I wont have a big full awkward smile...its just super intellectual, I'm confident, I crack jokes, more than happy to do something uncanny, a stereotypical ENTP slightly w higher Ti. I find myself being the stereotypical loud ENTP with people I'm close with like a friends. 

It is not like I can not socialise, I very well can-- more better than a lot of people I know but it is heavily case dependent, like you can not expect me to socialise in a new classroom, I do suffer from social anxiety, I can still pitch in a talk with someone who I find interesting though, but you can 100% expect me to socialise in a club, specifically which I sign up for, which I'm interested in. 

I enjoy spending time alone, I barely have any friends, most of schooling I've been antisocial and ' weird ', but now I realise that ENTP with the 5w4 just means that I'm an ENTP x INTP mix

Not sure what to do about this though, I end up coming out very charming in certain places, often leading people to believe I'm always like that-- a lot of people asked me for my ID and phone to contact me, keep talking, but I just go to these public spaces be myself, loud, charming, and just come out and act like non of it happened, is it just me that I want to be loud and forget it? is it just me that I enjoy having a niche based audience and not really consider making deep friendships out of EVERYONE? I hate having many friends, I do not even have a friend group, I prefer having 2 friends but have a ride or die relationship, I'd rather have 1000 acquaintances and 5000 connections (which I do, but sometimes I find it hard to manage) ",3,1739805240.0,ENTP_women,1,1.0,False

However, for some reason I find myself extremely nervous around attractive people even if it’s a girl. I overthink how they might respond. 

These days everyone has their AirPods on and just focus on music and their workout. I feel it is so forced when you make conversation with them. 

How can initiate a conversation without being awkward? A friend told me I shouldn’t do anything and let men approach me if they find me attractive. But I think I can’t just sit around for that miracle moment. ",2,1739805094.0,Advice,10,1.0,False

My tribe was full of winners, which I never tasted.
I was a late bloomer, So I told lies to overcome my flaws
a liar, but never evil
I never knew to be a good son or a father 


I was a burglar once to steal the love I never had.
I stole  but never keep
The reflection wasn't me
The Grey within me found new shades

The coffee grew cold like the distinct summer.
I wasted days that I regret
But the burglar in me finds her again

* As a Fulbright Scholar to the UK, MJ Sharp collaborated with a nocturnal ecologist who is also concerned about escalating light pollution and our loss of night and darkness. Archaeologists in Cornwall have newly discovered evidence that prehistoric peoples visited ancient megalithic sites in low light or at night. Sharp was intrigued and set out to photograph these ancient sites at night, hoping that it “might be restorative for present-day people who have lost access to their evolutionary birthright of experiencing darkness and night.”

1irlusz,https://www.reddit.com/r/macmini/comments/1irlusz/my_apple_setup_m4_mini_pro/,My Apple setup (M4 Mini Pro),"Heyy,  
Time for me to show some photos !

Got the M4 Mini Pro back in November, then slowly started to swap from a gaming style to a more modern one. Got this wonderful desk from an old lady who barely used it, and added some stuff to the black/gray/wood style

I like to adapt the setup to what I do, I can hide the keyboard and mouse below the stand (on the left), and instead put some chess board, cat, kid toys, coffee etc. I like to game but work has stepped in, and an Ultrawide is for me the best choice I could make.

About the specs:

\-M4 Mini Pro 16GPU 512/24 (Base Pro model, don't need anything above tbh in both work and gaming)  
\-LG Ultrawide 29' 2580\*1080p IPS 100Hz (I don't need above than 1080p as I'm far from the screen, and I don't see the difference between my old 120Hz phone and this monitor, but the ultra wide allows me to have two pages side-to-side in a single monitor)  
\- A lot of Razer stuffs, Sieren Mini, Kyio, Mamba Elite, Ornata Chroma (Should have a Basilisk V3, but does not work on Mac, meh.)  
\- Boooooooooks and DVDs (because I don't like the ""minimalist"" vibe, I like when it's full of stuffs)  
\- An iPhone XS that I got for free (with the old lighting connector and no Always-On, what a time to be alive)

So...we met 10 years ago, were together 4 years. We broke up due to long distance and lack of acceptance from family mainly. I never dated anyone after him until 2 years ago but now I broke off with my now ex-fiance. The ex-ex contacted me throughout the years. We met 3-4 times over the years when we were single after break up. I tried to push him away and break contact completely and when I was in recent relationship out of respect for my partner I never spoke or texted with him. He called me 3 years ago to sincerely apologise for his mistakes during our relationship, then we met for a coffee once and he dropped me couple messages (all before my recent fiance). Now we got in contact again. He called me, we spoke about our relationships. He also wants to meet up for a coffee. And honestly I realized it was always him and I love him dearly. He''s been the love of my life. We were young when we met and made a lot of mistakes in the relationship. I didn't give him another chance at the time as it was a lot... and hard on me. Now we grew and are totally different people. After 6 years post breakup there's still love there form my side. The reality is.. he is also seeing someone. Its pathetic but I don't want him to get married. I love him. I will always do. Should I tell him or leave it? I feel like if I die tomorrow or next week or year I'll keep this secret... I'm stubborn but I'm ready to let go of my ego and tell him about my feelings. If he doesn't feel the same we need to stop contacting each other completely. It's been killing me inside.

Even the ad for Vim had a model-like girl, which struck me as odd. It made me wonder, why is it that all these ads seem so out of touch with the reality of daily life in India?

When I think back to school, I had around 45 classmates, and only about 5-10 girls were fair-skinned, while everyone else had normal Indian brown skin. So why are these stereotypes so deeply embedded in media, and why are local actresses or models who look more representative of the average woman in Tamil Nadu not hired?

So this weekend I finally got around to installing the Bosch 500. I have a blind corner to run the drain through and the drain hose was around 8"" short of being perfect. So I patched in a small drain extension piece. I used a fish cable to get the new drain line through the blind corner. I tested my water temp coming out of the faucet at 130 degrees. Bosch says at least 120. The Bosch also has a regular plug which is great. I wired up a surface mount electric outlet and just plugged it in.

First run the dishes were really clean. Impressively clean. Even the coffee cup stains came off. Plastic also came out very clean. I could not even put the plastic in the Kitchenaid it came out worse than it went in. The door popping gimmick (dry cycle) is actually pretty cool! 

The Kitchenaid did seem to be better built for whatever that is worth. It had a much more solid feel especially with the racks and door. Not a big deal though. I do miss the lighted interior that the Kitchenaid had. Also the Bosch has an app but so far it seem fairly useless. It is nice to see how much time is left but other than that I am not really seeing a use for it. I think the 800 series has a projector that tells the remaining time on the floor. Mine just has a status color light. I kind of wish I had gone with the 800 just for that reason.

I was recently diagnosed and started on 30 mg, and just increased to 40 mg. I have heard that people tend to really struggle when they crash, and I also really like coffee, so my routine is to have my morning coffee and then wait an hour+ to take my vyvanse with breakfast around 10:30 or 11. On weekends it is closer to 11:30 or 12.   
  
My theory was that this would allow the crash to happen around the time I want to go to bed. I definitely had side effects when I first started taking vyvanse — racing heart being the biggest — but it’s all settled down now and sleep isn’t an issue for me. It hasn’t helped my bedtime procrastination by any means, but my quality of sleep is essentially the same so I consider that a win.  
  
Anyway, I am due to go back to the doctor to discuss how I am doing on 40 mg in a couple of weeks and wonder if I should be taking it first thing and then adding a boost mid-afternoon. But I’m worried the boost will make it hard to sleep? I assume my mornings could be so much more productive if I took it when I wake up, but I’m stuck on the worry that I will crash at burn late afternoon. I only have 40 mg pills so I’m reluctant to try first thing because if I crash, I don’t have any option to offset it.

I’d love to hear your experiences. 

If a booster helps, what is the max you can tolerate and the latest time you can take it without it messing with your sleep? 

I am so new to this and have no idea what the options are. I never even knew a booster was an option and hadn’t considered the idea of splitting the dose either. I’m open to anything that will make it the most helpful. TIA!",3,1739804444.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

This post is going to be a long one, so buckle up.
Backstory first: I 40F  am extreme introvert due to being screwed over so many in the past, between people not helping when I was SA'ed by a family member for years, and a 5 year relationship that was abusive. I've been fucked over by friends (one was talking to abusive ex, and after I fled, she told him where I was, and he showed up).   
Met my recent ex.... who has 2 best friends... who are his exes and they have all been friends for 20 years...
Ex- X (M39)
Friend 1- Y (F39) kid's mom)
Friend 2- Z (F39?)( X got her out of her shell when she was 19) 

X and I have known each other mutually for 15 years, I never hung out at his family's place, even though my son did all the time, and I was invited multiple times. We met officially when I moved into the house. We hung out one night alone, spent all night talking (I can go days without talking, and I prefer small talk with people 90% of the time) I moved in, and started dating the next day. 
On that first night, we were talking about how we were, I said I'm an introvert, and also that I knew Y, not personally, but I never liked her vibe, but would be ok with being civil. My boundaries were no talking about me, or our relationship. He said he was down with that. 
He told me he's an introvert too, and that he enjoys a 4 or 6 pk of beer, and bed early. 
Things were good for a month, and we got closer and found more in common and whatnot. I met Z, and actually laughed when she left, and said to him, ""You dated that?"" 

As time went on, I learned just how much these 3 talk on the daily basis... 20 times a day, and then he would talk about them all the time to me. I don't care that they are friends, but I started figuring out he was talking about me to them, and I was getting upset over it, and tried telling him that it wasn't ok. 
One day, Y was sitting in her car, and when I got  off  a long day at work, and exhausted, she told me to get in her car, we needed to talk... I was already annoyed, and she made it worse, by saying we got off on the wrong foot, and that we needed to be friends. I lost my cool on her, and said I didn't want to be, and I didn't want to get to know her onna personal level, but am totally able to be civil, and other things. She, of course, was butt hurt, even though she has 2,000 friends on her Facebook and knows everyone between 2 towns. She for some reason needed to me to be friends with her... not just civil. 
X was showing me just how much he really drinks, and other things, but he only did them around me, because he respected Y and Z so much, and they wouldn't allow him to drink around them. I had spent 2 years, telling X, that I didn't want to spend more on alcohol most night, but he was buying mikeys, plus cans of iced teas. Every night almost. I would drink with him too (I know I didnt have to, but if I didnt, he would drink every drop and wouldn't get any sleep at all), and we fought a lot....
When those fights happened, he would call Z, have her pick him up, and he would stay with her for a few days. X, Y, Z, would go on road trips, and go for coffee, and hang out for 6 hours, and still  call each other 2 hours later. 


X always used our fights as an excuse not to bring me to wherever they were going, and would tell them I was being a bitch. 
Last year he was displaced out of his home, and had to bounce between Y and Z's place, and another friend, for 2 months. The cops had put an assault charge on him, when he didn't. The next day, Y and Z came by the house, with the cops, and immediately cornered me to the back of the house, and were  in my face,  asking me over and over what I did, and saying it was all my fault, when neither me or X even knew wtf had happened. He finally got the report back, and it was all because I had asked him to shut the party down, and a friend of his he invited over, had told the cops he tried to punch me. Everyone blamed me for that night, while I was writing and calling crown counsel to drop the charges, and he didn't do anything to me. (He doesn't believe in hurting anyone, especially females)

He broke up with me after running to Z's house again, when he was drunk, and I wasn't  and he was scared to be kicked out of the house again coz of our fighting. (The cops have told him to leave almost once a month since he was allowed to be back home). 


We still talk every now and then, but he keeps throwing the fact that I have no friends (I have them, I just don't hang out with them on the daily, and will go out for coffee every now and then)... he wants to try again, but right now I'm not into because of the fact he respects Y and Z fully, and will do anything for them, when they ask... most recent one was, I've been asking him for almost the whole relationship to fix/paint his bathroom,  and fix the living room floor. He never did. But a few months, Z asked him to fix her bathroom, there was a crack in the tub, and he also repainted the bathroom, and he got paid for the job.  That was my breaking point, and started getting more and more annoyed with him. But, he couldn't figure out why. 

So... am I in the wrong for being angry everytime he throws my introversion/""not having friends"" in my face? Or when he says I'm bitter about him having friends? He doesn't see at all that it's not the fact he has friends... but how attached he is to his exes? ",1,1739804413.0,amiwrong,18,0.57,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I love good  laundry systems. If you have multiple machines this is fricking amazing. If not this all still applies anyhow except for time staggering (see below).

Stains.

Pre-spray shout on armpits colors and cuffs of shirts that have been sweated in. I had an Italian roommate in college who would stink up the Livingroom when he steam  ironed the armpits of his dress shirts- reactivating armpit odor .  Even though you could not see a stain the organic crap was in there. Shout's surfactants will dislodge this in the wash.

Use liquid blue Tide and shout for whites in cold water... not Tide pods (those are just for travel) BTW ""All brand detergent"" sucks and never use those 99 cent store detergents you will prematurely age and detroy teh colors in your clothes. Tide is the safest , and Woolite is actually harsh don't use it.. Use Tide in cold water and your whites will come out looking like they were done in hot and look like brand new. Only use hot water  for washcloths and bathmats. Warm is just a waste of energy as there is zero improvement in cleaning with Tide over cold.

Acetone or rubbing alcohol will dissolve ball point pen stains as will Gonzo. If you get cooking oil on dark cottons only Shout will ever get that out. If you have ketchup  on pure whites- Clorox bleach cleaning spray with the pump bottle  does miracles in just 3-5 min...rinse out immediately then wash. Be savage with this stuff on the white washcloths. Works far better than straight bleach (has other things to remove stains)  and won't damage clothes as much.

If you have a long term stain on whites that isn't motor oil . 1-2 oz bleach in a 5 gallon pail. cold water soak 3 days then launder a normal.

Blood? Period from lady friends- all fluids? Gonzo stain remover.

Salt for red wine.

Grease from car door jambs and trunk latches??? Grass -mud, eggs, gravy... Shout it out.

Now the washing strategy the goals are clean unwrinkled clothes for the least time spent, least wear and tear on everything, and least money spent in the machines. If you do this you won't  have clothes sitting hot after drying  all at once setting in wrinkles. This this way you can spend 1/2 the time on laundry in total because ironing is mostly eliminated and you can dry clothes much more efficiently. Also the machines you use will become available for others as you go. How annoyed have you been waiting for dryers full of dry clothes  taken up by others who are ""Fold overloaded' by having to do all the folding at once?). Read this twice...

1. Sort out a fastest drying and washing items first by color then similar fabrics and weights. Toss that in the first machine with shortest wash time .
2. NOW NOW NOW Start that machine BEFORE sorting more.
3. Now next shortest wash dry ...keep fabrics and weights of fabrics similar.
4. NOW Start that machine before sorting more (repeat)

You do this so all laundry is staggered i.e. not completing the cycles at the same time. If you have say more than 40-60 lbs of washing.. you don't want it finishing and wrinkling at the same time. This way no more than 2 loads finish at once, giving you time to fold continuously. Since the dryers are also staggered by estimated drying time  if when you are folding clothes you can guess how much more time is needed for the slightly damp item and toss into a dryer with enough time left. The total amount of stagger this way is only about 8-15 min depending on how many loads. So worth it not to iron!

5. Fold constantly, and take all shirts and pants out immediately and lay flat atop one another- and smooth out flat on flat surface . The residual heat will make it look like you ironed EVERYTHING.

ONLY AFTER you have stacked all the t-shirts and shirts (These are first priority , Pants, boxers, sweats . Then flip over the Stack leaving them flat - the bottom will NOW  be cooler and ""near ironed"" and start folding from the stack top (which was bottom).

\+ you can fold later or elsewhere. At least they aren't in a ball setting wrinkles. For the most part you will end up with everything folded and looking like it was ironed. Only dress shirts will need ironing - and those can be left slightly damp and dry using the steam iron. they will look professionally ironed this way without the tell tale ""Ruffle ridges on the button area"" of home ironing

6. Tuck your towels 1/3 fold in to the slot when tri-folding that way they wont fall over and need refolding. See that method on youtube.

Sometimes I I have really thick Turkish towels bath sheets (love them) I put the top sheets in with the towels but not the fitted sheets or duvets. (all cotton sheets and towels  no piling- what losers use blended fibers in sheets anyhow, suckers for marketing that's who!) Pop those in a large dryer and do not overload. The sheets with increased surface area will wick water from the towels and speed drying. When the turkish towels are near dry- take out the sheet and dry that alone to not have wrinkles in the sheet. Always finish towels for last 15 min on low to prevent weird shrinkage. Easy to do when all the loads are staggered as done above, it's natural that you will come across them when they are still damp as you can see from the sheet becoming dry first to signal you.

Use about 3/4 to 1/2 the recommended amount of Tide in cold water. Pre-spray all stans with Shout. If the stain is dried or deep use the nozzle of the shout bottle as a crude brush while injecting the stain by pumping while scrubbing with the nozzle. Use liquid fabric softener never those sheets- easy to do.

Never machine dry wool socks even merino ones. Never over dry sheets or towels. Pants washing inside out. Check all pockets twice. A single  Ballpoint pen or wad of tissues will ruin your day and your dryer.

1irlmcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1irlmcb/writing_in_public_vs_at_home/,Writing In Public vs At Home.,"Every writer is different,

We each have a unique fingerprint as a writer: whether it's our prose, routine, or our ideas and views on life.

Now, logically, one would think all writers are not social people: trapping themselves in their caves and abandoning humanity while in their throws of work. But I don't think that's entirely true.

 During my first few years as a writer, I tried this but found I just sabotaged myself by overthinking. So, I had to make the change. Now, to be fair, after my wife and I had our son, I had no choice but to change my routine. And since then, I can never imagine writing in an isolated fashion again - even if I achieve the dream of being a full-time fiction writer.

So I wanna see how many of us, like myself, prefer the other side of this.

I write better in public.

Mainly, I do it to watch the creatures known as humans in their social habitats. Sipping their liquids and chewing their chow. It helps me understand them more... feel closer to them.

But, no, seriously.  When my work is getting too much for me, I've found that it helps me to people-watch. It helps me feel grounded. Watching normal people do things as simple as ordering a mocha or talking with their friends reminds me that the world still moves no matter how angry I am with my craft or myself. If I don't have that touch with reality, I will go insane.

I go to the same damn cafe at the same damn time every day for my lunch break from 12-1 (sometimes later if I'm feeling naughty, hehe, sorry boss), and on Saturdays from 9-12. The owners at the coffee shop are really lovely and do everything they can to ensure I'm taken care of (whether it's because they know I'm on the collapse of a mental breakdown or because they support my dedication, who knows). It's kinda become public knowledge that I'm the ""writer at the coffee shop chasing his dreams"" at this point. \*To the point where I've been posted on their FB page and praised for my consistency\*  And it's not because people come up to me and stare at my screen, it's because people are curious why I'm there every single day working. I've heard writers say they're scared to write because of what others may think, but hell... who cares! People - despite what the news and world want you to believe - are caring and supportive. I've learned that if someone has the balls to come up to you and ask what you're doing, they have the heart to care, too. Even people who don't write, know how hard it is. And they just want you to know you're not alone, sometimes.

This journey is tough, and I'd recommend doing everything you can to make it easier mentally.",2,1739804087.0,writing,11,0.75,False

1irljuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1irljuj/sibling_wbpd_versus_my_healthy_partner/,Sibling wBPD versus my Healthy Partner,"I think me growing up has affected my sibling wBPD in a way. 

I know this is life, and it was bound to happen. But, when I started dating my now partner, everything was okay until it wasn't. My sibling began to make comments in front of them that genuinely were plain rude, and things I would never say to a friend or partner of theirs. It also came down to them holding a sense of contempt about my partner, who would ask my sibling out to activities with us every now and then. Errands alike; Stores, coffee runs, ice cream.

I brought up the comments in private to them, and I was split on really badly. Like, they have never spoken to me like that. I don't even remember what I said in the heat of the moment, but end of the day, their comments invoked a reaction my ancestors probably gasped at. Not a proud moment. End of the day, what was said to me caught me off guard. I kept clear for about two months. 

Fast forward to some ridiculous teary apology. We are here again. Comments had resumed, and they refrained from really ever coming to hang out with my partner and I again. To be honest, I was fine. They loved to use us as therapists for comments and concerning thoughts that my sibling would tell me in private that I had encouraged them to find help for. Still went to me to dissect, treat, calm, and soothe. I felt like I was drowning in opinions and horrendous ideas, delusions! that my own mental health led me to my own therapist. Best idea ever. 

This episode is far worse, I do believe because I am of no use anymore. I don't seek them out anymore. My partner is so healthy and loving and any comment I make about them, about a thing they did that was very thoughtful is met with a snarky face or remark. Like perhaps I don't want to talk about how my parents never loved us or were both conniving narcissists. It has never been true and will never be true. No one expected perfection. When I didn't validate every delusion, I was somehow some enemy in disguise. Told me wanting kids is a wasting my life. All the while their days are spent sitting in a room they never clean, in a house they never washed a dish in, with people who dont ask them for a dime, and not working cuz they cant be arsed. If I wanted them or didn't, I am fulfilled regardless. My life is how I wish to make it and I will find the happy in it.

My partner is the healthiest form of love. Loves my parents and they love him back. My friends love him. Its just my sibling I can tell. There's something so vengeful about the way they hate I am moving on from being their therapist. I have switched sides I suppose, I dont defend their shitty actions anymore. I don't care. But, for the first time ever, they are in fact splitting on me and I do think it's because my attention has shifted.

1irli0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1irli0t/roommate_wanted_part_15/,Roommate wanted. Part 15,"Tim’s breath hitched, and he took a step back, but Mason was already moving toward him. “Go on,” Mason said, his tone sharp and commanding. “Get on your knees. I’ve got something for you that most women only dream about.”

Tim hesitated, his mind racing. *This can’t be happening,* he thought. *This is too much. I can’t—* But before he could finish the thought, Mason’s voice cut through the air like a whip.

“Now, Tim. Or do I need to call Axl and let him know his wish genie isn’t cooperating?”

Tim’s heart sank. He couldn’t risk Nuria finding out he hadn’t fulfilled Mason’s wish. Reluctantly, he dropped to his knees, his hands trembling at his sides. Mason stepped past him and sat down on the couch, his smirk widening as he looked down at Tim.

“Good boy,” Mason said, his voice dripping with satisfaction. “Now, for my third wish… I wish for you, my little wish genie, to give me the best blowjob of my life. And I mean *the best*. You’re going to put in maximum effort, got it?”

Tim’s stomach churned, but he didn’t dare argue. Mason undid his pants and pulled them down, revealing his erection. Tim’s eyes widened, and he felt a wave of nausea, but he forced himself to stay still.

“Go on,” Mason said, his tone sharp. “Don’t keep me waiting.”

Tim hesitated for a moment, his mind racing. But he knew he didn’t have a choice. He leaned forward, his hands trembling as he reached for Mason. Mason, however, had other ideas. He grabbed Tim by the hair and pulled him closer, forcing his mouth onto him.

“That’s it,” Mason said, his voice low and teasing. “Show me what you’ve got, wish genie.”

Tim closed his eyes and tried to focus on the task at hand, but it was impossible to ignore the humiliation and disgust coursing through him. Mason’s grip on his hair was tight, and he guided Tim’s head with rough, deliberate movements. Every time Tim tried to pull away, Mason yanked him back, his grip tightening.

“Come on, Tim,” Mason said, his voice sharp. “You’re supposed to be giving me the best blowjob of my life. Put some effort into it.”

Tim forced himself to comply, his movements slow and mechanical. Mason, however, wasn’t satisfied. He grabbed Tim’s ears like reins, pulling him closer and forcing him to take more. Tim gagged, tears welling up in his eyes, but Mason didn’t stop.

“That’s it,” Mason said, his voice low and breathless. “Just like that. You’re doing great, wish genie.”

After a few minutes, Mason pulled Tim’s head back, giving himself a moment to catch his breath. “Not bad,” he said, his tone mocking. “But I think you can do better. Let’s go again.”

Tim didn’t have a chance to respond before Mason grabbed his head again and pushed him back down. This time, he was rougher, his movements more frantic. Tim gagged again, but Mason didn’t care. He pulled Tim’s head back one last time, his breath coming in ragged gasps.

“Almost there,” Mason said, his voice low and strained. “Just a little more…”

With a final, forceful thrust, Mason pushed himself as deep as he could go, holding Tim’s head in place as he came. Tim gagged and struggled, but Mason didn’t let go until he was finished.

Mason leaned back on the couch, a satisfied smile on his face. “Well, Tim,” he said, his tone casual, “that was… impressive. I might just have to call Axl and see if I can borrow his wish genie every month.”

Tim wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, his face burning with humiliation. He didn’t say anything. He couldn’t.

Mason stood up and pulled his pants back on, still smirking. “Alright, wish genie. You’re free to go. I’m done with you for now.”

 

 

Two days had passed since Tim’s humiliating ordeal at Mason’s house. For two days, he had taken the bus to work, his mind constantly racing with thoughts of Nuria, Axl, and his car. He hadn’t heard a word from any of them, and the silence was unnerving. *Where is my car?* he thought, his anxiety growing with each passing hour. *What are they doing with it?*

When he finally returned home after another long day at work, his heart sank as he approached the house. His car was parked in the driveway, but it was far from the pristine condition he had left it in. The rear taillight was shattered, and there was a noticeable dent on the side. Tim’s stomach churned as he walked closer, his dread growing with every step.

He opened the driver’s side door and froze. The interior was a disaster. Cigarette butts littered the floor, dirty condoms were strewn across the seats, and chewing gum was stuck to the carpet. The backseat was covered in empty fast-food containers and greasy bags, and a slice of pizza, oozing with melted cheese and grease, was slowly baking on the dashboard under the hot sun.

Tim’s hands clenched into fists, his anger boiling over. He slammed the car door shut and stormed into the house, his face red with fury. He found Nuria in the living room, lounging on the couch with a glass of wine in her hand. She looked up as he entered, her expression calm but with a dangerous glint in her eyes.

“Nuria,” Tim said, his voice trembling with anger. “What the hell happened to my car? It’s a complete mess! And there’s a dent in the side! What did you do?”

Nuria’s eyes narrowed, and she set her glass down on the coffee table. Slowly, she stood up and walked over to Tim, her movements deliberate and menacing. Before he could react, she drove her knee hard into his groin. Tim gasped, doubling over in pain as he collapsed to his knees.

“Don’t you *dare* speak to me like that, Timmy,” Nuria said, her voice cold and sharp. “You forget your place. I *always* look down on you. Always.”

Tim groaned, clutching his stomach, but before he could recover, Nuria slapped him hard across the face. The sound echoed through the room, and Tim’s head snapped to the side, his cheek stinging.

“I don’t accept that tone from you,” Nuria said, her voice low and dangerous. “Axl and I had two wonderful, luxurious days, and yes, maybe he shouldn’t have hit that pole, but that’s not the point. The point is, you don’t get to talk to me like that. Ever.”

Tim looked up at her, his eyes wide with fear and pain. “I… I’m sorry, Miss Nuria,” he stammered, his voice barely above a whisper.

Nuria’s smile was cold and cruel. “You’re going to stay right there on your knees, Timmy. And before we deal with the car, I’m going to punish you for your disobedience during the whole ‘genie and wishes’ idea. You didn’t follow through perfectly, and that’s unacceptable.”

Tim’s heart sank. He knew what was coming, and there was nothing he could do to stop it.

Nuria walked over to the corner of the room and picked up the whip she had used on Tim before. She twirled it in her hands, her smile widening as she approached him. “Five lashes, Timmy,” she said, her voice calm but with a sharp edge. “And after each one, you’re going to thank me and say something that reminds you how important I am to you. Understood?”

Tim nodded weakly, his body trembling. “Yes, Miss Nuria.”

“Good,” Nuria said, her smile widening. She stepped behind him and raised the whip. “Let’s begin.”

The first lash came down with a sharp crack, and Tim cried out in pain, his body jerking forward. Tears welled up in his eyes, but he forced himself to speak. “Th-thank you, Miss Nuria,” he stammered, his voice shaking. “You… you are like a princess to me.”

Nuria laughed, a cold, mocking sound. “Good boy. Let’s keep going.”

The second lash was just as hard, and Tim gasped, his hands gripping the edge of the couch for support. “Thank you, Miss Nuria,” he said, his voice trembling. “You… you are my everything.”

Nuria’s smile widened. “That’s better. Keep going.”

The third lash came down, and Tim cried out again, his body trembling with pain. “Thank you, Miss Nuria,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “You… you are my queen.”

Nuria laughed again, clearly enjoying herself. “Oh, Timmy, you’re learning. But we’re not done yet.”

The fourth lash was the hardest yet, and Tim screamed, his body convulsing with pain. Nuria stepped in front of him, her expression furious. She grabbed a fistful of his hair and yanked his head up, forcing him to look at her.

“You’re being too loud, Timmy,” she said, her voice low and dangerous. “I suggest you keep it down, or this is going to get much worse.”

Tim nodded weakly, his face streaked with tears. “Yes, Miss Nuria,” he whispered.

Nuria released his hair and stepped back, raising the whip again. “Now, for the fifth lash… I think we’ll make it special.”

Before Tim could react, Nuria drove her foot hard into his groin again. Tim gasped, doubling over in pain as he collapsed to the floor, his hands clutching his stomach.

“Get up,” Nuria said, her voice sharp. “Present yourself for the final lash.”

Tim groaned, his body trembling as he forced himself back onto his knees. He bowed his head, his hands gripping the edge of the couch for support.

The fifth lash came down with a sharp crack, and Tim cried out, his body jerking forward. “Thank you, Miss Nuria,” he said, his voice trembling. “You… you are my world.”

Nuria smiled, a cold, satisfied smile. She stepped in front of him and crouched down, her eyes locking onto his. She reached out and gently stroked his cheek, her touch almost tender.

“I hope you understand now, Timmy,” she said, her voice soft but with a sharp edge. “You don’t get to talk back to me. And when I come up with a good idea, you execute it perfectly. Understood?”

Tim nodded weakly, his body trembling with pain and exhaustion. “Yes, Miss Nuria,” he whispered.

Nuria smiled again and stood up, brushing off her hands. “Good. Now, go clean your car. And make sure it’s spotless. I don’t want to see a single crumb when you’re done.”

Tim nodded again, his mind a whirlwind of emotions. He forced himself to his feet and stumbled toward the door, his body aching with every step. As he stepped outside, he couldn’t help but wonder how much more he could take.

 

**--**

It was an ordinary workday for Tim. He had been sitting at his desk, trying to focus on a report, when his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen and saw Nuria’s name. His stomach dropped. *What does she want now?* he thought, his mind racing with possibilities. Reluctantly, he answered the call.

“Timmy,” Nuria’s voice came through the phone, sharp and commanding. “I need you to be ready by 1 PM sharp. I have an appointment, and you’re coming with me. I’ll pick you up at your office parking lot at exactly 1 PM. Don’t be late.”

Tim’s heart sank. “Miss Nuria, I… I have a meeting at 1 PM. I can’t just leave. I can be ready by 2 PM, but—”

Nuria cut him off, her tone icy. “Did I stutter, Timmy? I said 1 PM. Be there. I don’t care about your meeting. Cancel it.”

Tim hesitated, his mind racing. “But… Miss Nuria, it’s an important meeting. I can’t just—”

There was a long silence on the other end of the line, and Tim could feel the tension building. Finally, Nuria spoke again, her voice low and dangerous. “Timmy, let me make this very clear. You *will* be at the parking lot at 1 PM. I’ll be there in *your* car—yes, *your* car—and we’ll go to my appointment together. Understood?”

Tim swallowed hard, his throat dry. “Yes, Miss Nuria,” he said quietly.

“Good,” Nuria said, her tone softening slightly. “Don’t disappoint me, Timmy.”

The line went dead, and Tim sat there, staring at his phone, his mind racing. *How am I supposed to explain this to my boss?* he thought. *This is going to be a disaster.*

Tim took a deep breath and stood up from his desk. He walked down the hall to his boss’s office, his heart pounding in his chest. He knocked lightly on the door and waited for the gruff “Come in” before stepping inside.

“Tim,” his boss said, looking up from his computer. “What is it? You’re supposed to be in the meeting in ten minutes.”

Tim hesitated, his hands clenched at his sides. “Uh… sir, I… I need to cancel. I can’t make it to the meeting today.”

His boss’s eyes narrowed. “What do you mean, you can’t make it? This is an important meeting, Tim. You can’t just bail.”

Tim’s face burned with embarrassment. “I… I know, sir. But something urgent has come up, and I… I really can’t be there.”

His boss leaned back in his chair, his expression stern. “Tim, this is unacceptable. You can’t just skip out on meetings because something ‘urgent’ comes up. What’s so important that it can’t wait?”

Tim hesitated, his mind racing for an excuse. “It’s… it’s a family emergency,” he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper.

His boss sighed, clearly frustrated. “Fine. But this is a one-time thing, Tim. If this happens again, we’re going to have a serious conversation. Understood?”

Tim nodded weakly. “Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.”

His boss waved a hand dismissively. “Go. But make sure you’re here tomorrow, ready to work.”

Tim nodded again and quickly left the office, his face burning with humiliation. *I can’t believe I just lied to my boss,* he thought. *This is all Nuria’s fault.*

At 1 PM sharp, Tim was standing in the parking lot of his office, scanning the area for his car. But it was nowhere to be seen. He checked his watch, his anxiety growing with each passing minute. *Where is she?* he thought. *She said 1 PM sharp.*

After ten minutes of waiting, Tim pulled out his phone and sent a text to Nuria. *Miss Nuria, I’m at the parking lot. Where are you?*

A few minutes later, he received a reply. *I’m still getting ready. I’m on my way.*

Tim sighed, his frustration mounting. *She’s not even on her way yet,* he thought. *And I missed my meeting for this.*

He stood there, pacing back and forth, his mind racing. *Why does she always do this? Why can’t she just be on time for once?* But he knew better than to complain. Nuria didn’t tolerate excuses, and he wasn’t about to risk her anger.

At 2:30 PM, Tim finally heard the familiar sound of his car’s engine. He turned to see Nuria pulling into the parking lot, driving his car with a wide grin on her face. She screeched to a halt in front of him, the tires squealing against the pavement.

Tim walked over to the car, his frustration evident on his face. But as he approached, Nuria’s expression turned cold and stern. She rolled down the window and glared at him.

“Timmy,” she said, her voice sharp. “Why are you standing there like that? You know better than to approach me with that attitude.”

Tim immediately bowed his head, his shoulders slumping. “I’m sorry, Miss Nuria,” he said quietly.

Nuria’s smile returned, and she gestured for him to get in the car. “That’s better. Now, get in. We’re late.”

Tim opened the passenger door and slid into the seat, his body tense. As he buckled his seatbelt, he finally got a good look at Nuria. She was dressed in a sleek, dominant outfit—a tailored blazer, a tight pencil skirt, and high heels that clicked against the car’s floor. Her makeup was flawless, and her hair was perfectly styled. She looked every bit the powerful, commanding woman she always tried to be.

“You’re late, Miss Nuria,” Tim said quietly, unable to keep the frustration out of his voice.

Nuria’s eyes narrowed, and she turned to him with a cold smile. “Excuse me, Timmy? Did you just criticize me?”

Tim’s heart sank. “No, Miss Nuria. I… I just meant—”

Nuria cut him off with a sharp laugh. “Oh, Timmy, you’re so cute when you try to act tough. But let’s get one thing straight—you don’t get to question me. Ever. Understood?”

Tim nodded weakly, his face burning with humiliation. “Yes, Miss Nuria.”

Nuria smiled, satisfied, and started the car. “Good. Now, let’s go. We have an appointment to get to.”

As they drove off, Tim couldn’t help but feel a sense of dread. *This is going to be a long day,* he thought. *And it’s only just beginning.*

 

As Nuria drove Tim’s car down the highway, the tension in the vehicle was palpable. Tim sat stiffly in the passenger seat, his hands clenched in his lap, his mind racing with questions. He glanced at Nuria, who was focused on the road, her expression calm but with a hint of mischief.

“Miss Nuria,” Tim began hesitantly, “where are we going?”

Nuria smirked, her eyes still on the road. “It’s a surprise, Timmy. But I’ll give you a hint—it has something to do with your TV, the one that’s now in my room.”

Tim’s heart sank. *Of course,* he thought bitterly. *She’s probably going to make me buy her a new one or something.* But he didn’t dare say that out loud. Instead, he nodded weakly. “Okay, Miss Nuria.”

They drove in silence for a while, the hum of the engine filling the car. After about fifteen minutes, Nuria let out an exaggerated sigh. “Ugh, this is so boring,” she said, her tone dramatic. “Timmy, do something to cheer me up.”

Tim blinked, caught off guard. “Uh… what do you mean, Miss Nuria?”

Nuria rolled her eyes. “I mean, entertain me. Tell me a joke or something. This drive is putting me to sleep.”

Tim hesitated, his mind racing for something to say. “Uh… okay. Why don’t skeletons fight each other?”

Nuria raised an eyebrow. “Why?”

“Because they don’t have the guts,” Tim said, forcing a weak smile.

Nuria sighed, clearly unimpressed. “That’s the best you’ve got? Really, Timmy? I thought you were supposed to be funny.”

Tim’s face burned with embarrassment. “I… I’m sorry, Miss Nuria. I’m not really good at jokes.”

Nuria shook her head, her expression one of mock disappointment. “Fine. Tell me something interesting, then. What’s going on at work?”

Tim hesitated, unsure if she actually cared or if she was just trying to pass the time. “Uh… well, we’re working on a new project, and—”

Nuria cut him off with a sharp laugh. “Boring. Next.”

Tim’s shoulders slumped. He didn’t know what to say. He glanced out the window, his mind racing for something—anything—that might satisfy her.

Finally, Nuria broke the silence. “Tell me about Mason,” she said, her tone casual but with a hint of curiosity. “What did you have to do for him? I want to hear all the details.”

Tim’s heart sank. He didn’t want to relive the humiliation of that night, but he knew better than to refuse. “Uh… well, he had three wishes,” Tim began, his voice quiet. “The first one was laundry. I had to wash, dry, and fold all his clothes. And iron the stuff that was already clean.”

Nuria laughed, a light, airy sound that made Tim’s skin crawl. “Oh, that’s rich. What else?”

Tim swallowed hard. “The second wish was… uh… he wanted me to pay off his Jeep. The one I cleaned. He still had a lot of payments left, and he… he made me pay it off.”

Nuria’s eyes widened, and she let out a low whistle. “Wow. That’s bold. How much did that cost you?”

Tim hesitated, his face burning with humiliation. “A… a lot, Miss Nuria.”

Nuria laughed again, clearly enjoying herself. “Oh, Timmy, you’re too much. What was the third wish?”

Tim’s heart raced. He didn’t want to tell her, but he knew he didn’t have a choice. “Uh… the third wish was… a blowjob.”

Nuria burst out laughing, her voice echoing through the car. “A blowjob? “

Tim nodded weakly. “Yes, Miss Nuria.”

Nuria shook her head, still laughing. “Oh, Timmy, you’re such a pushover. But I have to admit, I’m a little jealous.”

Tim’s heart sank. He knew where this was going.

Nuria glanced at him, her smile widening. “You know, Timmy, I could really go for an orgasm right now. What do you think?”

Tim’s eyes widened in panic. “Miss Nuria, I… I don’t think that’s a good idea. We’re driving, and it’s dangerous—”

Nuria cut him off with a sharp laugh. “Oh, Timmy, don’t be such a prude. I’m not asking for your opinion. I’m telling you what’s going to happen.”

She reached down and hiked up her skirt, revealing that she wasn’t wearing any underwear. Tim’s face burned with humiliation, and he quickly looked away.

“Timmy,” Nuria said, her tone sharp. “Look at me.”

Tim hesitated, then slowly turned his head, his eyes wide with fear.

“I want you to lick me,” Nuria said, her voice calm but with a dangerous edge. “Right now. While I’m driving.”

Tim’s heart raced. “Miss Nuria, please… this is really dangerous. We could crash, and—”

Nuria’s expression darkened, and she reached over to grab a fistful of his hair, yanking his head closer to her. “Timmy, let me make this very clear. You’re going to do as I say, or you’re going to regret it. Fifteen lashes, Timmy. “

Tim’s stomach churned, but he knew better than to argue. “Yes, Miss Nuria,” he whispered.

“Good,” Nuria said, releasing his hair. “Now, get to work.”

Tim hesitated for a moment, then leaned over, his face burning with humiliation. He began to lick her, his movements slow and hesitant. Nuria let out a soft moan, her hands tightening on the steering wheel.

“That’s it, Timmy,” she said, her voice breathless. “Just like that.”

As they drove, Nuria gave him instructions, her voice calm but with a sharp edge. “Harder, Timmy,” she said, her fingers tangling in his hair. “Don’t stop.”

Tim obeyed, his mind a whirlwind of emotions. The humiliation, the fear, the sheer absurdity of the situation—it all swirled together into a heavy, suffocating weight.

After a few minutes, Nuria pulled the car over into a quiet, dead-end street. She shifted in her seat, spreading her legs wider to give Tim better access. “Don’t stop,” she said, her voice low and commanding. “Keep going.”

Tim obeyed, his movements becoming more desperate as Nuria’s moans grew louder. She gripped his hair tightly, pulling him closer as she reached her climax. Her body tensed, and she let out a loud cry of pleasure, her legs clamping down around his head.

When it was over, Nuria leaned back in her seat, her breathing heavy. “Good boy, Timmy,” she said, her voice soft but with a sharp edge. “Now, clean me up.”

Tim hesitated, but he knew better than to argue. He leaned in again, his movements slow and deliberate. When he was done, Nuria smiled, clearly satisfied.

“You did well, Timmy,” she said, her tone almost affectionate. “I didn’t know you had it in you. It wasn’t perfect, but you’ll learn.”

Tim nodded weakly, his face burning with humiliation. He sat back in his seat, his mind racing. *How did I end up like this?* he thought. *Why can’t I just walk away?*

But deep down, he knew the answer. Nuria had complete control over him, and there was no way out. Not yet, at least.

After another thirty minutes of driving, Nuria pulled into the parking lot of a large, imposing building. She parked the car and turned to Tim, her smile widening.

“We’re here,” she said, her tone cheerful. “Let’s go.”

Tim nodded weakly and followed her out of the car, his mind still reeling from what had just happened. As they walked toward the building, he couldn’t help but wonder what Nuria had planned for him next.

But deep down, he knew it didn’t matter. Whatever it was, he would have to obey. Nuria had made sure of that.

 

Tim followed Nuria into the large, brightly lit photography studio, his head bowed and his shoulders slumped. He made sure to keep his head lower than hers, a habit he had developed to avoid her wrath. Nuria noticed his posture and let out a soft, amused chuckle. *He’s really putting in the effort,* she thought, her lips curling into a smirk. *Good boy.*

As they entered, a man in his late thirties approached them, a friendly smile on his face. “Welcome!” he said, extending a hand to Nuria. “You must be Nuria. And this is…?”

Nuria glanced at Tim, who was standing slightly behind her, his eyes fixed on the ground. “This is Timmy,” she said, her tone casual but with a hint of possessiveness. “He’s here for the photoshoot.”

The man raised an eyebrow and looked at Tim, his expression a mix of curiosity and concern. “Uh… Tim, do you know what you’re signing up for here? This is a pretty… unique shoot.”

Before Tim could respond, Nuria stepped in, her voice sharp and dismissive. “Of course he knows. This is like a gift for him. Right, Timmy?”

Tim nodded weakly, his face burning with humiliation. “Yes, Miss Nuria.”

The man hesitated for a moment, clearly unsure, but then shrugged. “Alright, if you say so. Let’s get started.”",2,1739803768.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

Thank you so much for all the excitement and support around ListForge--its been really energizing as a developer! So I wanted to get an update out to you all quickly in return. The latest update (1.1.3) is now available in all the same places!

In this update, I focused on bugfixes and some of the widely-requested features. All bugs reported should be fixed--please let me know if you find any that slipped through the cracks (or any new ones). I of course couldn't get to all the great feature ideas you all came up with, so if you don't see a feature that you're excited about in the update, don't worry, it is still being worked on and/or taken into consideration.

Some newly added features to look out for include: **rule descriptions** (hold the rule name to view), **adding multiple units at once** (press the plus button to multi-add or elsewhere on the unit tile to single-add), number of **profile counts in view-mode**, and **detachment rules displayed everywhere**!

Please join the project Discord to provide feedback (preferred) or drop it here in the comments--please refrain from sending it via DM as its getting hard to manage due to the volume--thanks! Discord link: [https://discord.gg/rynNqmC9mq](https://discord.gg/rynNqmC9mq)

Lastly, please check out my Ko-Fi (similar to Patreon) page to support the project/buy me some coffee to power bug squashing (lots of coffee has been consumed in the development of ListForge)! I've set a goal of $3000 total Ko-Fi donations to develop Crusade support for 40k. If the goal is reached, I will start development on it immediately and continually maintain it. Crusade support has been a widely-requested feature so if that's of interest to you, please consider. Ko-Fi link: [https://ko-fi.com/listforge](https://ko-fi.com/listforge)

1irlgdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProsTips/comments/1irlgdz/brainway_app_review_my_honest_experience/,Brainway app review: my honest experience,"So, i found out about this app on reddit and wanted to share my experience with you, maybe there are more people like me. So, I’ve been testing out the brainway app for a few weeks now, and I wanted to share in case anyone here is looking for tools to improve focus and productivity.

At its core, the app tracks things like mood, energy levels, sleep, and even habits like caffeine intake. One of the most surprising takeaways for me was seeing patterns I hadn’t really noticed before, like how skipping breakfast or overloading on coffee leads to an energy crash later in the day, making it harder to focus and stay on task.

One thing I do like is the small actionable challenges the app suggests, like a morning stretch routine or limiting social media time. I wasn’t expecting much from those, but surprisingly, they did help me stay more engaged throughout the day. The step-tracking challenge, in particular, helped me break up long work sessions and avoid falling into endless scrolling.

That being said, the app does require regular input, which can feel like another task to keep up with. I also wish it had a feature for tracking deep work sessions or integrating with existing productivity tools to make the insights more actionable.

For anyone who struggles with procrastination or wants to identify what’s affecting their focus, it could be useful, especially if you’re someone who benefits from seeing trends in your behavior over time. If you’re already highly structured and disciplined, you might not find it as necessary, but for those trying to build better habits, it could be a helpful tool.

Has anyone else here tried it? Curious to hear if it’s helped you improve focus or break unproductive cycles!",16,1739803640.0,LifeProsTips,1,0.95,False

1irle0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1irle0w/my_jura_filter_and_cleaning_spreadsheet_results/,My Jura filter and cleaning spreadsheet results,"I've been keeping track of Jura consumables and thought I'd share my findings for those who are interested in the total cost of operation.

First, my water tests out as almost no hardness, I set it it at 5 out of 30 on my machine just to get a little leeway for the filter and descale intervals. You usually pick filter OR descale, not both, but the water hardness you enter has an effect on the interval.

These costs are given in USD.

**FILTER**

The CLEARYL Smart+ filter costs $20. I got 241 product serving on that before the machine asked for a new filter. That is mostly coffee products but some hot water for tea. I think they all count as usage.

That comes to 8.2 cents a cup.

**DESCALE**

The machine will want to be descaled if you don't use a filter. A package of descaling tablets also cost $20, but that has 3 descales in it. So that comes to about 2.7 cents a cup.

**CLEANING TABLETS**

I cleaned my machine and noted the count. My machine went 283 cups before it asked to be cleaned again. Cleaning tablets are $14 for 6 or $2.33 a cleaning. So that comes out to only .8 cents per cup.

So, if you choose filter, then your cost is 9 cents a cup or $9 per 100.

If you choose descale, your cost is 3.5 cents a cup or $3.50 per 100.

I know some people tend to think the Jura products are expensive, but in the overall scheme of things, I don't think it's that terrible if you compare it to buying an espresso or Americano at Starbucks.

**MILK CLEANING**

The new Jura tablets are $35 for 180g and supposed to get you 60 milk cleanings. So that's 58 cents a cleaning.

You'll have to figure out milk cleaning for yourself. You need clean at least daily if you if you make 1 or 10 milk drinks.

If you make milk drinks every day, that's $17.50 a month.

I tend to only make milk drinks on weekends so that's only $4.64.

**Alternative Products**

If you're out of warranty and want to save some money, Woldo makes Cleaning and Descaling products and Rinza makes Milk Cleaning products that will cost quite a bit less than using Jura products.

1irlbm9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1irlbm9,In-depth opinions on some niche and designer fragrances!,"Hello to all the fragrance enthusiasts, it's been over a few months since I did an in-depth reviews of some niche perfumes([here's the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiFragranceAddicts/s/08i3AohUUt)) and was encouraged by a few commentors for some more reviews. The following are another set of personal opinions on some 10ml niche and designer decants (I also have 2/2.5/5ml samples. But this is just for the 10 ml decants that I've purchased from Scentoria and one from Anmol Shukla (u/Unhappy-Repeat-3015). Before starting, these are certain things I've come to realize for the past few months - 

👉🏼 Accords and notes that I keep inclining towards - Woody, spicy, smoky, earthy aromatics, ambery, nutty, bitter and spicy non-gourmand gourmands, delicate florals, soapy, leather and musk. 

👉🏼 Accords and notes that I tend to avoid(since I've not been able to find a proper one)- Citrusy freshies, Jammy florals, lactonic(currently exploring but majority of them turns into a weird scent on my skin) and sweet vanillas. 

👉🏼 Accords and notes I'm currently exploring - Rose, Tea, Fig, Honey, Sandalwood, Guaiac Wood, Tuberose, Neroli, Lactonic scents and Animalic notes such as civet (strangely loving it on me even though my parents said I stink but I stink good😁😁) 

1. ARABESQUE BY THE MERCHANT OF VENICE -

■ Notes : Tobacco Leaf, Plum, Ginger, Cinnamon, Tonka Bean, Cedar, Benzoin, Musk and Vetiver. 

■ What am I actually smelling : The opening is giving me roasted sauf with darchini sprinkled over it, something liquorish sweet, beautiful smooth unlit tobacco, a little dusty and the inside of an expensive leather handbag. As it dries down, the darchini keeps getting prominent along with that beautiful liquor scent and is also very balsamic like vanilla but that roasted sauf smell keeps lingering in the background, something woody like a camphorous fresh furniture scent comes out and it gradually becomes a fennel-ish, cinnamony, vanilla-ish unlit tobacco inside of a leather bag kept on a table freshly built from cedar. 

■ Remarks : This is a straight up gorgeous scent something a royal might wear❤! Had I smelled it before starting my sampling journey, it would have completely blown me but after sampling 8-9 tobacco centric scents, this kind of becomes ""just another perfume"" but definitely one of the best ones in the category that I've come across, maybe nothing unique but it just screams opulence! I had my eyes on this one for quite a while but I couldn't find it anywhere until I saw it on the decant list of Anmol Shukla( u/Unhappy-Repeat-3015). 

■ Performance : 6-6.5 hrs on my skin and the whole day on clothes. After the 3rd hr, the vanilla becomes a little prominent on my skin along with that darchini and the wood. On my clothes it's more of the darchini and the liquor along with the wood. 

■ Full bottle worthy : While this gorge of a scent is close to what I like in my tobacco perfumes, I feel like it's still not up to that ""point"" when it comes to the tobacco to actually invest in a full bottle. 

2. CONTRALTO BY SOSPIRO - 

● Notes : Orange Blossom, Pink Pepper, Clove, Juniper Berries, Guaiac Wood, Chestnut, Cashmeran, Vanilla and Peru Balsam. 

● What am I actually smelling : This is giving me exactly 3 things - The toiletries (shampoos, lotions, etc) provided by an expensive hotel that you have just opened and smelled, it certainly smells like a hotel lobby after someone uses all the air fresheners they have and also it is giving me a luxurious spa! The soapy or the lotion-y notes have to be from the orange blossom and it is also a little tart and borderline citrusy and very clean-ishly musky.

● Remarks : This stuff is blended to the Gods! 🤯🔥 It's smooth as puck! I smell like someone who has probably spend an hour dousing in body washes and lotions. I just wish the wood accord to be a little more prominent. It has Guaiac Wood and Chestnut listed but none of them are prominent on my skin and clothes. It took me 3 wears to actually appreciate this beautiful soapy, musky and an airy scent. This is a perfume that smells like a literal luxury atleast to my nose. 

● Performance : 8-9 hrs on skin and the whole day on clothes. For an airy scent, the longevity is impressive as fudge! After the 4th hour, the soap accord becomes more prominent on my clothes than my skin. 

● Full bottle worthy : Hell yeah. Drown me in this stuff. ❤❤

3. CUIR BELUGA BY GUERLAIN - 

■ Notes : Tangerine, Aldehydes, Immortelle, Patchouli, Vanilla, Suede, Heliotrope and Amber. 

■ What am I actually smelling : To me this one somehow reminds me of that Shingar liquid kumkum bindi that used to come in 11 colours🤐! That liquid kumkum bindi smell goes in the back after around 10 mins and then the actual vanilla along with the smoothest leather pop up which is more of an expensive leather shop scent rather than a rugged leather. I smell something green or earthy in the background but somehow it is getting counteracted by that smooth soft creamy leather which to me seems like the main character in this perfume. 

■ Remarks : I used to love sniffing those bindi tubes during my childhood so this scent definitely hit that nostalgic spot for me. But in terms of the perfume itself, I love the fact that it is not predominantly a sweet vanilla fragrance.  The smooth soft leather adds some much needed character along with that faint green earthy situation(I guess that is the patchouli speaking). It's somewhere between an occasional and everyday scent. 

■ Performance : 6-6.5 hrs on skin and the entire day on clothes. After the 3rd hour, that kumkum bindi smell again comes in the front on clothes but on skin the smooth creamy leathery vanilla persists. After the 5th hour it becomes a faint powdery lipstick-ish scent on skin and on clothes it's basically somewhere between kumkum bindi and the suede. 

■ Full bottle worthy : Is this a beautiful scent? Yes. Is it INR 33k worthy? Hell naww! 🤐😶

4. DOLCE AMALFI BY XERJOFF - 

● Notes : Quince, Cardamom, Apple, Saffron, Cloves, Tolu Balsam, Incense, Vanilla, Tonka Bean, Amber, Cedar and Musk. 

● What am I actually smelling : A juicy laung(cloves) bomb! It definitely has that Dabur daant laal manjan powder scent going on. There's this woody accord in the base that is kind of similar to Little Song by Meo Fusciuni but more subdued. It is a clove blast from the start to the finish. The opening is more of a juicy clove like you have pierced a juiciest apple with a lot of cloves and taking a big bite of it while the base settles into this more clove-y wood and something faintly Amrutanjan-ishly balmy. 

● Remarks : An absolutely gorgeous and comforting scent! This is a scent that straight up transports you to a happy place💛! I want to keep sniffing again and again, it is that beautiful. I sprayed Starlight and Dolce Amalfi side by side and the combination is pretty much the most comforting scent I've ever smelled in my life. It's warm and spicy but not punchy but comforting like a hug from your loved ones!

● Performance : 6-7 hrs on skin. Whole day on clothes. After the 3rd hr, it smells like someone is heating up cloves on a piece of freshly cut wood. At the end of the 6th hr, it becomes this faint laung scent along with some faint dusty woody accord. 

● Full bottle worthy : Yes, yes and hell yeah drown me in this stuff (2). ❤❤

5. EPIC 56 WOMAN BY AMOUAGE - 

■ Notes : Pink Pepper, Cinnamon, Cumin, Rose, Geranium, Jasmine Tea, Amber, Musks, Oud, Frankincense, Guaiac Wood, Orris, Sandalwood, Patchouli, Vanilla 

■ What am I smelling : Cinnamon? Check! Cumin? Check! But pan masala?🤐😶 Well......check! The opening note have this spicy, Chasme glycerin soap-ish smell mixed with peptobismol-ish florals with a pan masala aroma! It's there along with an essential oil-ish scent which I guess is the Geranium(I used to have a Geranium essential oil, it kind of smell like that). There is this prominent woody like a freshly built furniture smell 15 mins after spraying the perfume. But that pan-masala is still lingering somewhere along with a prominent darchini and jeera! After 30 mins I somehow get a talcum powdery spicy rose soaked in a glass of water in which some tablets have been dissolved. The dry down gets more woody and more green-ish earthy which I guess is the patchouli. 

■ Remarks : I was(am still) so confused by the initial whiff because something about the pan-masala situation wasn't sitting right with me but it eventually keep getting subdued by an array of spices and probably the Geranium. It is legit edgy! I don't like to smell like pan masala but I like smelling edgy hence the confusion! The woody-powdery-florally-peptobismoly dry down of this perfume is what makes me want to love this 44k worth of stuff!  Whatever woodwork sorcery, perfumer Cécile Zarokian managed to put into the dry down is just pure heaven! This is a perfume that is blended to the Gods🔥❤!

■ Performance : 10-12 hrs on skin and whole day on clothes(not to be sprayed on light clothes). In my humble opinion, the real stuff unfurls in the dry down with that wood, powdery and greenery which I got after the 3rd hour. For the first 60 mins I sat there confused what to do with this faint pan masala smell. This shit projects(not like MAB's Tilia level projection) for quite a while! 

■ Full bottle worthy : Hell yeah minus the paan masala for 60 mins. Drown me in this stuff(3). 

6. GOLD INCENSE BY CAROLINA HERRERA - 

● Notes : Cinnamon, Angelica, Marigold, Bergamot, Labdanum, Atlas Cedar, Incense, Madagascar Vanilla and Sandalwood. 

● What am I actually smelling : This one opens with a darchini giving it a Chasme glycerin soap smell. The incense here is more of a monastery incense, very soft, very subdued! I can smell some wood in the background and also something aromatically balm-ish. This feels like you're walking in the woods and all of a sudden start smelling a soft incense from somewhere. You follow the smell and go deeper into the woods and come across this monastery well hidden from the outside world. You sit there taking in the nature, peace and tranquil❤. It's the most peaceful you have ever felt. I couldn't figure out any vanilla, it was just fresh wood along with a soft incense and cinnamon. 

● Remarks : This is one of the perfumes that I upgraded to a 10ml decant from a 4ml sample. I love this! No doubt! This is the closest to peace I've felt after a long time. It's a legit journey. The way it evolves on my skin is so beautiful. It just makes a happy and peaceful bubble around me. Mind you, this one has a fewer aspects of Starlight and a fewer aspects of Vanille Havane especially the cinnamon part, it changes it's direction exactly when the incense starts coming out. 

● Performance : 4-5 hrs on skin and almost the entire day on clothes. After the 3rd hr on skin, it starts becoming a little soapy, slight talcum-y chandan with darchini lurking in the background and I also get this scent of a book whose pages have turned yellow. On clothes in the dry down, the incense is prominent along with something balm-ish and woody and something a hint of some florals. 

● Full bottle worthy : Hell yeah even though the performance could be a lot better! Drown me in this stuff(4). ❤❤

7. GRIS CHARNEL BY BDK PARFUMS 

■ Notes : Cardamom, Fig, Black Tea, Iris and Bourbon Vetiver, Sandalwood and Tonka Bean. 

■ What am I actually smelling : Right from the start, it is a cardamom blast! The opening immediately reminds me of those elaichi cream biscuits(I loved having those with a cup of tea)! This one is the most perfume-y of all the ones in this list. Something in this perfume smells like an antique shop meets with a wedding evening. As it start to dry down it reminds me of a certain talcum powder I used to apply before leaving for school. The wood accord here feels very smooth like a grey silk over a log of wood. It is giving me luxurious bath and body products!🔥

■ Remarks : This is another one that I upgraded to a 10ml decant after sampling the 2ml. As a tea-holic person, on me I couldn't detect even an ounce of any tea. But I'm not mad at it because I didn't expect any. But this definitely smells luxurious as fudge! I can see myself wearing this in very special occasions. To me this is not a comforting scent but rather a scent that says,"" I am here to make an impression"" that screams confidence and opulence😎🔥!

■ Performance : 8-9 hrs on skin. Whole day on clothes. This one projects(not like MAB Tilia level)! After the 4th hour, I can make out something greenish but it keep getting subdued by the prominent sandalwood and a very powdery thing which I guess is the Iris which kind of started veering into the agarbatti direction but somehow it remains beautifully balanced. On clothes for 3hrs, I keep smelling elaichi + a trail of a strong wedding scent that you smell if you get closer to the bride. Gradually, the wood accord comes out giving it more of an oomph and dries down into this powdery smooth woody floral perfume-y scent. 

■ Full bottle worthy : Hell yeah. Drown me in  this stuff. (5) ❤❤

8. LITTLE SONG BY MEO FUSCIUNI : 

● Notes : Pink Pepper, Ginger and Bergamot, Coffee, Turkish Rose Oil, Liatris, Tobacco, Bourbon Vetiver, Civet, Musk, Labdanum and Sage. 

● What am I actually smelling : The pepper just slaps you right in the face on the first spray!! I get roasted sauf and there's the bitter coffee which isn't very prominent but it's definitely there! And ofcourse the tobacco comes through in a very soft manner nothing over the top but very smooth. I get something green in here, quite a bitter herbal green but that roasted sauf smell is VERY prominent. Also the dry down has the dabur daant manjan toothpowder mixed with a freshly built furniture scent which is strangely addictive. Imagine you have this beautiful quaint little cabin smack dab in the middle of the woods. The fire crackling in the fireplace, you are sitting by it with an old withered diary in your hands and an unlit tobacco pipe lies on the table beside you just by the bowl of some roasted coffee and fennel seeds. The glass window is ever so slightly ajar and the cool night breeze flows into the space. 💛

● Remarks : Am I completely blown away that I remained seated dumbfounded on how a fragrance actually captured ""a cabin in the woods""? Yes. Yes. Yes. Holy smoking cats🤯🤐🔥! This was a love at first sniff even though I should be offended by the peppery slap. I have no words for this fragrance other than the fact that I need my existence and my entire house to smell like this😌❤! The tobacco here, though as transient as it gets, is absolutely beautiful and probably the closest to what I actually love in a tobacco fragrance even though it's not a tobacco-centric one. It would have been wonderful if the warm and beautiful smoky tobacco smell remained throughout the fragrance, but unfortunately it didn't.

● Performance : 5 hrs on my skin and 14-15 hrs on clothes. After the 3rd hr mark, the wood accord becomes so addictively prominent on my skin that if you close your eyes you'll be transported to an expensive furniture shop. On my clothes, it's bitter green with a sack full of roasted sauf and a cup full of coffee beans for the first 2 hours and dries down into a very woody, toothpowder-y bitter green-ish scent.

● Full bottle worthy : Heck yeah even though the performance is not very good but this has absolutely blown my socks off! Drown me in this stuff. (6) ❤❤❤❤

9. L'OMBRE DANS L'EAU BY DIPTYQUE - 

■ Notes : Black Current Leaf, Rose, Black Current Blossom and Petitgrain. 

What am I actually smelling : This starts like a branch of a tree all covered in fragrant leaves. You pluck a lot of leaves and crush them in your hand. Then you notice a rose bush, you pluck one and crush it all with it's flowers, stems and leaves alongside the priorly crushed fragrant leaves. At this point your hand will start smelling quite strongly of an essential oil. 

■ Remarks : Holy Mother of Greens🤐🤧! This perfume definitely succeeds in capturing a realistic rose garden. I legit scrunched my nose and let out a little cough the moment I sprayed it because it was that sharp and green! I like green scents but this one as much as I appreciate the vision, this pretty much smells like a straight up essential oil on me. If I smell it from a distance I do get the vision of a garden but the moment I put my arms to my nose, it's just giving me essential oil that brings me to the fact, this is not for the cars especially for people with motion sickness! 

■ Performance : 9 hours on skin and on clothes until you wash it. This one projects like this is a fragrance that will make you seen(still not like MAB Tilia level projection)! The fragrance remains pretty much the same both on my skin and clothes but after the 4th hr the rose as in the rose petals accord is a little prominent on my clothes than my skin where it is just all leaves, stems and thorns. 

■ Full bottle worthy : Nope. It would have been a full bottle worthy if not for the scent becoming an essential oil on me and making me carsick. 

10. WHITE HINOKI BY AMOUROUD - 

● Notes : Ginger, Blood Orange, White Pepper, Labdanum, Heliotrope, Cinnamon, Hinoki Wood, Whiskey and Tobacco. 

● What am I actually smelling : You have white wood floors in your house and you have just cleaned them with phenyl😶. This is exactly what I smell seconds after spraying it. There is something about it that is giving me that orange Digene tablets. After almost an hour, I am getting a prominent wood shaving accord combined with orange digene tablets and maybe a dash of phenyl!

● Remarks : This is a strangely addictive scent! Very meditative! Very zen! I would personally prefer my room to smell like this. But I really don't mind it when I smell like a chalta-firta clean white wood floor! 

● Performance : 7-8 hrs on skin and whole day on clothes. After the 4th hr, I start smelling like a concoction of woodshavings and talcum powder. I am not supposed to enjoy this ""concoction"" but strangely it really does work on my skin and my dad legit said that I smelled like a ""chalta-firta furniture ka dukan""🤭😅!

● Full bottle worthy : Hell yeah! Drown me in this stuff. (7) ❤❤

Thank you so much for reading till the end🙏🥺❤. Hope this helps. I'll probably upgrade a few more samples to 10ml decants in the upcoming months till then I got to finish my samples before I start buying more😁.",13,1739803268.0,desifemfrag,8,1.0,False
1irlaoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1irlaoy/sitting_still/,Sitting still,Hi all. Random but I think common question maybe? I definitely have adhd and drink coffee like a dumbass. I'm attending a Jimmy Fallon taping on 2/26 and I been fine in the past but my anxiety been different and adhd is never cooperating. I take klonopin for anxiety.

It's an hour long taping I believe. Thanks ,0,1739803198.0,ADHD,3,0.5,False
1irla1k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1irla1k,In-depth opinions on some niche and designer fragrances!,"Hello to all the fragrance enthusiasts, it's been over a few months since I did an in-depth reviews of some niche perfumes([here's the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiFragranceAddicts/s/08i3AohUUt)) and was encouraged by a few commentors for some more reviews. The following are another set of personal opinions on some 10ml niche and designer decants (I also have 2/2.5/5ml samples. But this is just for the 10 ml decants that I've purchased from Scentoria and one from Anmol Shukla (u/Unhappy-Repeat-3015). Before starting, these are certain things I've come to realize for the past few months - 

👉🏼 Accords and notes that I keep inclining towards - Woody, spicy, smoky, earthy aromatics, ambery, nutty, bitter and spicy non-gourmand gourmands, delicate florals, soapy, leather and musk. 

👉🏼 Accords and notes that I tend to avoid(since I've not been able to find a proper one)- Citrusy freshies, Jammy florals, lactonic(currently exploring but majority of them turns into a weird scent on my skin) and sweet vanillas. 

👉🏼 Accords and notes I'm currently exploring - Rose, Tea, Fig, Honey, Sandalwood, Guaiac Wood, Tuberose, Neroli, Lactonic scents and Animalic notes such as civet (strangely loving it on me even though my parents said I stink but I stink good😁😁) 

1. ARABESQUE BY THE MERCHANT OF VENICE -

■ Notes : Tobacco Leaf, Plum, Ginger, Cinnamon, Tonka Bean, Cedar, Benzoin, Musk and Vetiver. 

■ What am I actually smelling : The opening is giving me roasted sauf with darchini sprinkled over it, something liquorish sweet, beautiful smooth unlit tobacco, a little dusty and the inside of an expensive leather handbag. As it dries down, the darchini keeps getting prominent along with that beautiful liquor scent and is also very balsamic like vanilla but that roasted sauf smell keeps lingering in the background, something woody like a camphorous fresh furniture scent comes out and it gradually becomes a fennel-ish, cinnamony, vanilla-ish unlit tobacco inside of a leather bag kept on a table freshly built from cedar. 

■ Remarks : This is a straight up gorgeous scent something a royal might wear❤! Had I smelled it before starting my sampling journey, it would have completely blown me but after sampling 8-9 tobacco centric scents, this kind of becomes ""just another perfume"" but definitely one of the best ones in the category that I've come across, maybe nothing unique but it just screams opulence! I had my eyes on this one for quite a while but I couldn't find it anywhere until I saw it on the decant list of Anmol Shukla( u/Unhappy-Repeat-3015). 

■ Performance : 6-6.5 hrs on my skin and the whole day on clothes. After the 3rd hr, the vanilla becomes a little prominent on my skin along with that darchini and the wood. On my clothes it's more of the darchini and the liquor along with the wood. 

■ Full bottle worthy : While this gorge of a scent is close to what I like in my tobacco perfumes, I feel like it's still not up to that ""point"" when it comes to the tobacco to actually invest in a full bottle. 

2. CONTRALTO BY SOSPIRO - 

● Notes : Orange Blossom, Pink Pepper, Clove, Juniper Berries, Guaiac Wood, Chestnut, Cashmeran, Vanilla and Peru Balsam. 

● What am I actually smelling : This is giving me exactly 3 things - The toiletries (shampoos, lotions, etc) provided by an expensive hotel that you have just opened and smelled, it certainly smells like a hotel lobby after someone uses all the air fresheners they have and also it is giving me a luxurious spa! The soapy or the lotion-y notes have to be from the orange blossom and it is also a little tart and borderline citrusy and very clean-ishly musky.

● Remarks : This stuff is blended to the Gods! 🤯🔥 It's smooth as puck! I smell like someone who has probably spend an hour dousing in body washes and lotions. I just wish the wood accord to be a little more prominent. It has Guaiac Wood and Chestnut listed but none of them are prominent on my skin and clothes. It took me 3 wears to actually appreciate this beautiful soapy, musky and an airy scent. This is a perfume that smells like a literal luxury atleast to my nose. 

● Performance : 8-9 hrs on skin and the whole day on clothes. For an airy scent, the longevity is impressive as fudge! After the 4th hour, the soap accord becomes more prominent on my clothes than my skin. 

● Full bottle worthy : Hell yeah. Drown me in this stuff. ❤❤

3. CUIR BELUGA BY GUERLAIN - 

■ Notes : Tangerine, Aldehydes, Immortelle, Patchouli, Vanilla, Suede, Heliotrope and Amber. 

■ What am I actually smelling : To me this one somehow reminds me of that Shingar liquid kumkum bindi that used to come in 11 colours🤐! That liquid kumkum bindi smell goes in the back after around 10 mins and then the actual vanilla along with the smoothest leather pop up which is more of an expensive leather shop scent rather than a rugged leather. I smell something green or earthy in the background but somehow it is getting counteracted by that smooth soft creamy leather which to me seems like the main character in this perfume. 

■ Remarks : I used to love sniffing those bindi tubes during my childhood so this scent definitely hit that nostalgic spot for me. But in terms of the perfume itself, I love the fact that it is not predominantly a sweet vanilla fragrance.  The smooth soft leather adds some much needed character along with that faint green earthy situation(I guess that is the patchouli speaking). It's somewhere between an occasional and everyday scent. 

■ Performance : 6-6.5 hrs on skin and the entire day on clothes. After the 3rd hour, that kumkum bindi smell again comes in the front on clothes but on skin the smooth creamy leathery vanilla persists. After the 5th hour it becomes a faint powdery lipstick-ish scent on skin and on clothes it's basically somewhere between kumkum bindi and the suede. 

■ Full bottle worthy : Is this a beautiful scent? Yes. Is it INR 33k worthy? Hell naww! 🤐😶

4. DOLCE AMALFI BY XERJOFF - 

● Notes : Quince, Cardamom, Apple, Saffron, Cloves, Tolu Balsam, Incense, Vanilla, Tonka Bean, Amber, Cedar and Musk. 

● What am I actually smelling : A juicy laung(cloves) bomb! It definitely has that Dabur daant laal manjan powder scent going on. There's this woody accord in the base that is kind of similar to Little Song by Meo Fusciuni but more subdued. It is a clove blast from the start to the finish. The opening is more of a juicy clove like you have pierced a juiciest apple with a lot of cloves and taking a big bite of it while the base settles into this more clove-y wood and something faintly Amrutanjan-ishly balmy. 

● Remarks : An absolutely gorgeous and comforting scent! This is a scent that straight up transports you to a happy place💛! I want to keep sniffing again and again, it is that beautiful. I sprayed Starlight and Dolce Amalfi side by side and the combination is pretty much the most comforting scent I've ever smelled in my life. It's warm and spicy but not punchy but comforting like a hug from your loved ones!

● Performance : 6-7 hrs on skin. Whole day on clothes. After the 3rd hr, it smells like someone is heating up cloves on a piece of freshly cut wood. At the end of the 6th hr, it becomes this faint laung scent along with some faint dusty woody accord. 

● Full bottle worthy : Yes, yes and hell yeah drown me in this stuff (2). ❤❤

5. EPIC 56 WOMAN BY AMOUAGE - 

■ Notes : Pink Pepper, Cinnamon, Cumin, Rose, Geranium, Jasmine Tea, Amber, Musks, Oud, Frankincense, Guaiac Wood, Orris, Sandalwood, Patchouli, Vanilla 

■ What am I smelling : Cinnamon? Check! Cumin? Check! But pan masala?🤐😶 Well......check! The opening note have this spicy, Chasme glycerin soap-ish smell mixed with peptobismol-ish florals with a pan masala aroma! It's there along with an essential oil-ish scent which I guess is the Geranium(I used to have a Geranium essential oil, it kind of smell like that). There is this prominent woody like a freshly built furniture smell 15 mins after spraying the perfume. But that pan-masala is still lingering somewhere along with a prominent darchini and jeera! After 30 mins I somehow get a talcum powdery spicy rose soaked in a glass of water in which some tablets have been dissolved. The dry down gets more woody and more green-ish earthy which I guess is the patchouli. 

■ Remarks : I was(am still) so confused by the initial whiff because something about the pan-masala situation wasn't sitting right with me but it eventually keep getting subdued by an array of spices and probably the Geranium. It is legit edgy! I don't like to smell like pan masala but I like smelling edgy hence the confusion! The woody-powdery-florally-peptobismoly dry down of this perfume is what makes me want to love this 44k worth of stuff!  Whatever woodwork sorcery, perfumer Cécile Zarokian managed to put into the dry down is just pure heaven! This is a perfume that is blended to the Gods🔥❤!

■ Performance : 10-12 hrs on skin and whole day on clothes(not to be sprayed on light clothes). In my humble opinion, the real stuff unfurls in the dry down with that wood, powdery and greenery which I got after the 3rd hour. For the first 60 mins I sat there confused what to do with this faint pan masala smell. This shit projects(not like MAB's Tilia level projection) for quite a while! 

■ Full bottle worthy : Hell yeah minus the paan masala for 60 mins. Drown me in this stuff(3). 

6. GOLD INCENSE BY CAROLINA HERRERA - 

● Notes : Cinnamon, Angelica, Marigold, Bergamot, Labdanum, Atlas Cedar, Incense, Madagascar Vanilla and Sandalwood. 

● What am I actually smelling : This one opens with a darchini giving it a Chasme glycerin soap smell. The incense here is more of a monastery incense, very soft, very subdued! I can smell some wood in the background and also something aromatically balm-ish. This feels like you're walking in the woods and all of a sudden start smelling a soft incense from somewhere. You follow the smell and go deeper into the woods and come across this monastery well hidden from the outside world. You sit there taking in the nature, peace and tranquil❤. It's the most peaceful you have ever felt. I couldn't figure out any vanilla, it was just fresh wood along with a soft incense and cinnamon. 

● Remarks : This is one of the perfumes that I upgraded to a 10ml decant from a 4ml sample. I love this! No doubt! This is the closest to peace I've felt after a long time. It's a legit journey. The way it evolves on my skin is so beautiful. It just makes a happy and peaceful bubble around me. Mind you, this one has a fewer aspects of Starlight and a fewer aspects of Vanille Havane especially the cinnamon part, it changes it's direction exactly when the incense starts coming out. 

● Performance : 4-5 hrs on skin and almost the entire day on clothes. After the 3rd hr on skin, it starts becoming a little soapy, slight talcum-y chandan with darchini lurking in the background and I also get this scent of a book whose pages have turned yellow. On clothes in the dry down, the incense is prominent along with something balm-ish and woody and something a hint of some florals. 

● Full bottle worthy : Hell yeah even though the performance could be a lot better! Drown me in this stuff(4). ❤❤

7. GRIS CHARNEL BY BDK PARFUMS 

■ Notes : Cardamom, Fig, Black Tea, Iris and Bourbon Vetiver, Sandalwood and Tonka Bean. 

■ What am I actually smelling : Right from the start, it is a cardamom blast! The opening immediately reminds me of those elaichi cream biscuits(I loved having those with a cup of tea)! This one is the most perfume-y of all the ones in this list. Something in this perfume smells like an antique shop meets with a wedding evening. As it start to dry down it reminds me of a certain talcum powder I used to apply before leaving for school. The wood accord here feels very smooth like a grey silk over a log of wood. It is giving me luxurious bath and body products!🔥

■ Remarks : This is another one that I upgraded to a 10ml decant after sampling the 2ml. As a tea-holic person, on me I couldn't detect even an ounce of any tea. But I'm not mad at it because I didn't expect any. But this definitely smells luxurious as fudge! I can see myself wearing this in very special occasions. To me this is not a comforting scent but rather a scent that says,"" I am here to make an impression"" that screams confidence and opulence😎🔥!

■ Performance : 8-9 hrs on skin. Whole day on clothes. This one projects(not like MAB Tilia level)! After the 4th hour, I can make out something greenish but it keep getting subdued by the prominent sandalwood and a very powdery thing which I guess is the Iris which kind of started veering into the agarbatti direction but somehow it remains beautifully balanced. On clothes for 3hrs, I keep smelling elaichi + a trail of a strong wedding scent that you smell if you get closer to the bride. Gradually, the wood accord comes out giving it more of an oomph and dries down into this powdery smooth woody floral perfume-y scent. 

■ Full bottle worthy : Hell yeah. Drown me in  this stuff. (5) ❤❤

8. LITTLE SONG BY MEO FUSCIUNI : 

● Notes : Pink Pepper, Ginger and Bergamot, Coffee, Turkish Rose Oil, Liatris, Tobacco, Bourbon Vetiver, Civet, Musk, Labdanum and Sage. 

● What am I actually smelling : The pepper just slaps you right in the face on the first spray!! I get roasted sauf and there's the bitter coffee which isn't very prominent but it's definitely there! And ofcourse the tobacco comes through in a very soft manner nothing over the top but very smooth. I get something green in here, quite a bitter herbal green but that roasted sauf smell is VERY prominent. Also the dry down has the dabur daant manjan toothpowder mixed with a freshly built furniture scent which is strangely addictive.

The fire crackling in the fireplace, you are sitting by it with an old withered diary in your hands and an unlit tobacco pipe lies on the table beside you just by the bowl of some roasted coffee and fennel seeds. The glass window is ever so slightly ajar and the cool night breeze flows into the space. 💛

● Remarks : Am I completely blown away that I remained seated dumbfounded on how a fragrance actually captured ""a cabin in the woods""? Yes. Yes. Yes. Holy smoking cats🤯🤐🔥! This was a love at first sniff even though I should be offended by the peppery slap. I have no words for this fragrance other than the fact that I need my existence and my entire house to smell like this😌❤!

It would have been wonderful if the warm and beautiful smoky tobacco smell remained throughout the fragrance, but unfortunately it didn't.

● Performance : 5 hrs on my skin and 14-15 hrs on clothes. After the 3rd hr mark, the wood accord becomes so addictively prominent on my skin that if you close your eyes you'll be transported to an expensive furniture shop. On my clothes, it's bitter green with a sack full of roasted sauf and a cup full of coffee beans for the first 2 hours and dries down into a very woody, toothpowder-y bitter green-ish scent.

● Full bottle worthy : Heck yeah even though the performance is not very good but this has absolutely blown my socks off! Drown me in this stuff. (6) ❤❤❤❤

10. WHITE HINOKI BY AMOUROUD - 

● Notes : Ginger, Blood Orange, White Pepper, Labdanum, Heliotrope, Cinnamon, Hinoki Wood, Whiskey and Tobacco. 

● What am I actually smelling : You have white wood floors in your house and you have just cleaned them with phenyl😶. This is exactly what I smell seconds after spraying it. There is something about it that is giving me that orange Digene tablets. After almost an hour, I am getting a prominent wood shaving accord combined with orange digene tablets and maybe a dash of phenyl!

● Remarks : This is a strangely addictive scent! Very meditative! Very zen! I would personally prefer my room to smell like this. But I really don't mind it when I smell like a chalta-firta clean white wood floor! 

● Performance : 7-8 hrs on skin and whole day on clothes. After the 4th hr, I start smelling like a concoction of woodshavings and talcum powder. I am not supposed to enjoy this ""concoction"" but strangely it really does work on my skin and my dad legit said that I smelled like a ""chalta-firta furniture ka dukan""🤭😅!

● Full bottle worthy : Hell yeah! Drown me in this stuff. (7) ❤❤

1irl91r,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1irl91r/day_five/,Day Five,"Still going strong over here. Yesterday was hard I had some cravings but was able to curb them with candy, hydrating, or a nic mint. Just starting my day five and I do feel like I want to vape today BUT I also remember how shitty it feels after taking time away from it. When I think about that feeling I do not want to vape. Today I am on my own and home alone and have the day off of work so I think it will be a harder day. It’s weird my cravings are worse today than yesterday ugh. 
Here are some positives I am already feeling from my quit:  

- more energy 
- waking up feeling more refreshed 
- food and candy and coffee actually feel good, the constant dopamine drip o was on with the vape literally made it so anything I was looking forward to was really just looking forward to so I could feel the vape hit after. 
- my mouth and teeth feel cleaner 
- breathing already feels deeper and clearer

1irl8ou,https://www.reddit.com/r/serviceadvisors/comments/1irl8ou/first_time_sa_at_acura/,First time SA at Acura,"Thursday was my first full day at the service desk at my local Acura dealer. It’s a relatively small service center, just two advisors, a customer relations specialist, and our fixed ops manager. I’m here to share my accomplishments to get to be in this position, as well as looking for advice as a new SA and someone who’s relatively new to the industry in general. 

Some backstory: 
I left my previous job where I was an assistant manager at a coffee shop of all places because Ive driven two Acuras and love them, to work an entry level position at my local Acura dealer. “Client Care” was the title. For those of you at other dealers without a similar position it’s basically a glorified porter. Fill out a sheet with basic info of vehicles that come in for service, and wash cars that are done in service. 

Worked in client care for 5 months, but was just promoted to SA. One of the advisors left after ~5yrs to go work on the admin side of a larger manufacturer. I like to think I have a good work ethic, I’m a natural problem solver, and I have a great relationship with our fixed ops manager, so ultimately he picked me for the position. I’m decent with customer service and I have a basic/intermediate automotive knowledge, so I have a good starting point but still have a lot to learn. 

And no, I’m not sharing my pay plan or looking for “well, *actually*, x dealer is better”. I’m happy with my current position and am going to use it as a good starting point. And yes, I’m aware of how shitty of a job this can be in the long run. I’ve already set aside a part of my budget for coffee and energy drinks. But where I’m 20yo with no post-secondary education under my belt, I think this is a good start to my career

Can you not see other cars?,"I know people like to shit on people who drive these trucks, but that’s not the point of this post. I’m asking genuinely. I went to get coffee this morning and had two incidents with these trucks. 

The first one, we came up to double left turn lanes. I was in the left, he was in the right. As we took the turn he just came over in my lane like I wasn’t even there. 

Second, I was pulling out of the Dunkin parking lot and the guy just changed lanes right on top of me. Again, like I wasn’t even there. 

Did these guys just not look, or can you legit not see other cars? I’m already cautious of all cars on the road (especially where I live, JFC) but if I need to be extra aware of these trucks because of visibility, I’d like to know.

1irl5qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1irl5qh/adult_life_is_overwhelming/,Adult life is overwhelming,"I (23F) have always been hard-working and kept busy, I’ve always had lots of hobbies and friends, got good grades, always took care of myself, cleaned my room, loved cooking for myself and others, exercised regularly, went out with friends almost everyday etc. I’ve always been quite a healthy and motivated person.

Recently I’ve noticed that since leaving college and getting a job I have slowly gotten lazier and lazier. I have struggled with depression in the past, but usually when that happens I’ll just have weeks where I can’t get out of bed. This is different. I will do all the basic things that make me functional: I will go to work, shower, brush my teeth, put makeup on, etc. Nobody in my life suspects that anything is different than usual, I seem completely normal. But I realised recently that I have completely stopped doing anything that requires effort at all - even things that make me happy. 

Examples of things I’ve noticed that worry me: I often skip meals because I don’t go grocery shopping, everything I eat is pre-made (I used to cook breakfast and dinner every day), I stopped drinking tea because I ran out of teabags 3 months ago, I cancel most plans and if I see people it’s always the same closest friends (I haven’t made a new friend in over a year), I stopped buying any of my favourite drinks/snacks, I stopped using my desk because I spilled coffee on it a month ago and haven’t cleaned it yet, the only times I will do my laundry is if I run out of clothes, I have a laundry basket in my closet but because I’m too lazy to open the door to the closet I just constantly have a pile of dirty clothes by my bed, all my plants died because I forgot to water them so my room has been full of dead plants for months, I’ve been to lazy to throw them away, my ashtray has been overflowing so now I use the table as an ashtray, there’s been a leak in my bathroom for over a year and all I have to do is send an email to get it fixed and I haven’t.
The list goes on and on. There’s just nothing in my life that I do for myself that takes even a little bit of effort. All I do when I’m alone is play video games and scroll through instagram. I seem functional to everyone around me because no one sees this stuff and I still do a lot for other people and at work, but I feel like I’m just slowly stopping to exist, and I don’t know how to start living properly again. 

Since I realised what’s happened I’ve tried slowly trying to do things again but everything makes me so overwhelmed. Even thinking about basic, easy, and rewarding things makes me cry. I can’t even go get a coffee from the cafe just downstairs. It seems like I have limited energy and there is just way too much to do, I don’t even know where to start. I think adult life overwhelmed me, I just can’t take care of myself, and work, and see friends, and relax, and have hobbies. It’s all too much. I genuinely don’t think this is depression, if anything I think I’ve made myself depressed with this lifestyle. 

Has anyone else gone through this? How do you balance everything that comes with adult life? What can I do to get back to normal? I want to just start being functional again but I don’t know where to start, it all seems like too much.",6,1739802803.0,needadvice,10,0.75,False

By the way, this interview has 48 questions!**

**DATE PUBLISHED: 2ND JULY, 2022**

**⚠️ ORIGINAL SOURCE IS IN THE COMMENTS ⚠️**

⭐

*In a galaxy far, far away…*

>***The following people who worked on the interview:***

>***Interviewers: Liliya P, Anastasia K, Alexander S, Alyona Coleman.***

>***Designer and editor: Liliya P.***

*^(Good evening, gladiators and gladiatrix! The phenomenal end of the first season and the extension of the story for the third season did not leave our team indifferent. Dmitry kindly agreed to give us an interview in order to share the latest news and reveal something new about the lore of the story and about himself.)*

*^(In this interview, there will be questions from the group's administration first, and then from subscribers.)*

*^(Have fun reading!)*

“Hello, Dmitry, we are glad to finally have a heart-to-heart talk! First of all, congratulations on the brilliant conclusion of the first season, as well as on the extension of the novel. This is our common small victory, which we defended as best we could. And, of course, we cannot help but congratulate you on your long-awaited vacation! How are you planning to spend it?”

**Dmitry:** Hello!) I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone once again for their activity and concern. This reaction was a pleasant surprise for all of us) There are two more weeks before the vacation, we need to spend them productively! I would like to relax, walk a lot and be inspired by new places. However, the purpose has not yet been determined)

**(1) Anyway, we wish you a good vacation.) Let's start with the extension then. Were the two episodes of the June update written before the news that Gladiator Chronicles would be extended after all? And if you had known in advance that three seasons were waiting for you, would you have written these episodes in a different way?**

**Dmitry:** Thank you very much! Yes, the main shift was planned for August, these episodes would have remained in the form they were supposed to be in anyway. If I'm not mistaken, they were written before the extension. Now I allowed myself to approach the transition a little smoother, so it will be a little delayed)

**(2) So, it turns out that the time skip is not waiting for us in the August update?**

**Dmitry:** That's right. It would have been possible if I had been faster, but so far I have only managed to write two chapters per update, unfortunately. I hope that with experience, speed will come, which will not harm the quality. But! I am glad to inform you that, in my gut feeling, the August chapters are the best that I have ever written)

**(3) We still remember that after the first episode there was an announcement that the plot was being revised. What changes were ultimately made in Gladiator Chronicles? Perhaps you can share some deleted scenes?**

**Dmitry:** We made the plot more condensed, trying to minimize scenes with exposition and world structure. At that time, I didn’t yet understand how many functions the backdrops of locations perform, that they themselves can “speak” and convey certain information and atmosphere.

The plans, for example, were to keep Rix as a slave longer to show the hopelessness and fear that a person can have in such circumstances. These kinds of scenes were in the plans, but were not written, because I received feedback from the players in time, with which I largely agreed)

**By the way, Orvon copes with such scenes perfectly. Sometimes I feel so sorry for him, he is absolutely not prepared for such a life. It’s good that Rix’s strong shoulder is next to him.)**

**Dmitry:** Yes, Orvon needs more protection and some kind of care. Born into a fairly wealthy family, he did not do dirty work. And by nature, the guy is softer and more vulnerable. In my life observations, such people need much more time to get used to something that is unusual for them)

**(4) By the way, we noticed that Orvon, although not very popular as a LI among players, but his fans are the most loyal. So, we are very curious to know what Rix felt when he saw Tori in Orvon's house, given that they broke up. How did Rix perceive their meeting and why could he show such actions to Tori if he had previously decided to put an end to their relationship?**

**Dmitry:** This is a very difficult emotional moment for Rix, who broke up. On the one hand, the dots seem to be set, but the emotions and feelings that he felt for her cannot be cut off so easily. A kiss and hug is a loophole for those players who found it difficult to make such a decision, and they would like to at least support their ex–girlfriend, if not make amends.

It seems to me that in such a case (of an unexpected meeting with a person who was once dear), the emotional nature of the reaction cannot be excluded. It could have been an unexpected outburst of gratitude, joy. Tori, on the other hand, will take this impulse a little more restrained)

**(5) One of the entertainments in the GC universe is gladiator fights and the holiday from the first episode. What was it dedicated to and what other holidays exist in this universe? Once there was an option in the “Truth or Lie” post about New Year's greetings from Augusta, is this waiting for us in the future?**

**Dmitry:** Just like in our world, some holidays are global, some are local. The holiday from the first chapter was local. If I remember correctly, it was dedicated to the day of the foundation of Kardom, but I could be wrong, since I haven't looked at these notes for a long time)

In “Truth or Lie” posts, I allow myself to joke a little and I'm very glad that it's well received. About Augusta and New Year, of course, it's a joke)

**(6) Our entire administrative staff is delighted with the elder Flavius! That's how charismatic he turned out to be. I wonder, when you created his image, were there any characters that you were inspired by? (For example, he often says the phrase ""you're smart,"" which can't help but remind me of CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow :))**

**Dmitry:** Yes, Cassius Flavius ​​is love. I really love the series ""Lie to Me"". Cassius in some moments reminded me of Dr. Lightman, played by the incredible Tim Roth, whom I adore with all my heart.

""You're smart"" is more about the young Cassius, who did things in his youth (laughs).

**(7) And if you had to choose a character from the novel to sit down and talk with a little, who would you choose: Caesar or Cassius?**

**Dmitry:** I would drink dry red wine with both of them (laughs)

**(8) How is the idea of posters for each new season created and implemented? Are there any references?**

**Dmitry:** Posters for me are always a headache.) I want to thank my game designer Nikita and artist Masha for helping me with this difficult task. Guys, I can't live without you)

Our poster is a collective one, and the references were taken not from posters, but from conceptual art. Although the folder with posters of various scientific and practical films still lives on my computer.

**(9) And the girl on the poster next to Rix – is it Tori or Darea? Or someone else altogether? Or is this a spoiler?**

**Dmitry:** I like reading player theories, I don't want to stop them with my answer)

**(10) How are things with the archive? Or was it one of the experiments? You once said that in the future we will be able to visit the archive and learn something new.**

**Dmitry:** It will return! Not in August, but it will definitely be. There are already clear ideas on how to organize it)

**(11) How long did it take you to write the ""skeleton"" of the plot? And how do you deal with ""stagnation"", when inspiration leaves you and you can't come up with anything? Or have you not encountered such difficulties yet?**

**Dmitry:** We are given enough time to develop the skeleton, there can be no stagnation) They can appear during the writing of a chapter – that's true. When I understand that the text resists and stalls, I try to bring it to the next stage very quickly.

Planning helps a lot both in the long and short term. This is one of the most effective ways to get off the ground)

**(12) Does genetic engineering have anything to do with the fact that Caesar has changed so much in five years? (We previously saw him aged greatly in the Palatium (palace) scenes, but in the update we see a rather young Caesar)**

**Dmitry:** Yes, to some extent. But it is not the only one. This point will be explored quite extensively in the story.

**(13) We've been waiting for a long time to meet Rix's cat. And here it is! Why Gendal?**

**Dmitry:** Because I love the Lord of the Rings!) But I didn't want to add ""f"" since the reference was already pretty obvious. But seriously – the cat simply survived a fight with another cat named Balr.

**(14) We noticed your love for the Lord of the Rings. Who is your favorite character? Have you read the books?**

**Dmitry:** Yes, of course! A friend gave me a copy of the Lord of the Rings when I was 11-12 years old, and I still haven't returned it to him. I didn't like Gimli as a child, but now I think he's a masterpiece)

**(15) Since we're talking about cats, what are yours' names? And we think our subscribers (and us, let's face it) would be interested in seeing your furry bandits)**

**Dmitry:** Their names are Marcel (the prototype of our Gendal) and Nesquik.

[Marcel](https://preview.redd.it/qztwig9ylpje1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79cd0c00788a3b23dea410f0d6da9f2c93c89330)

[Nesquik](https://preview.redd.it/y1znsei1mpje1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38237d8a6c2dcdb4f54d25b3e0f068ec315568a2)

**Why Nesquik?)**

**Dmitry:** Because he's a sweet kitty! (laughs)

To be honest, it's hard for me to imagine a 27-year-old guy talking about a cat like that, but I can't explain it any other way (laughs)

**(16) If you were writing a Noir story, what pseudonym would you choose?**

**Dmitry:** I'd write under someone like Bill Johnson)

**(17) Which of the screenwriters do you communicate with most often? Or maybe you ask one of them for advice?** 

**Dmitry:** I've spoken to Ursa quite often lately, and congratulated Marina and Anastasia on finishing their stories. In short, I have good, friendly and collegial relations with almost everyone)

**(18) In our first interview, you shared that you love basketball. How do you feel about football? Who are you rooting for?**

**Dmitry:** As a child, I supported Real Madrid and Manchester United, because David Beckham played there. I hardly follow football now)

**(19) We have heard that RC has a merch in its plans. What would you like to see, based on your story?**

**Dmitry:** I don't know about merch, unfortunately.) I think a gladiator's sword. Or scarium balls that you need to spin in your hand and relax. And also Cassius' rosary! And wine under his brand. (laughs)

**(20) Will you continue to focus on variability?**

**Dmitry:** I will try to find a middle ground) Two episodes will be released in August – the first, it seems to me, is both variable and quite lengthy (I hope), the second is less variable, but it should be more authentic. But it's dictated by the plot in any case.

**(21) In 06x01, we could ask Gars to be our mentor. I wonder if this choice will play a role? And should we expect Stortia as a mentor?**

**Dmitry:** Yes, definitely!

**(22) If Rix were to end up in our time, what would he do?**

**Dmitry:** Depends on which path to take.) To be honest, I have no idea. But I'm sure he would be successful in his chosen field)

**(23) We found out that Afiy has been enslaved since childhood and he doesn't remember his parents at all. Did he manage to find out anything about their fate?**

**Dmitry:** Thank you for bringing this up. Some players asked me why in the first story about his parents he says that they are old, and in the recent one – that he doesn't remember them, only individual images. In the first conversation, he and Rix are not that familiar. In it, Afiy talks about what he heard from someone. In the second, when he opens his soul, the memories are more personal, although not specific. No, unfortunately, he knows nothing about them. The tracks were lost, since he was often thrown from one owner to another.

**A sad fate… It is good that, despite this, Afiy was able to maintain his spiritual kindness.** 

**Dmitry:** It is incredibly difficult and important in difficult times. But it is necessary.

**(24) Imagine: You are Rix. Who of the female characters would you invite on a date?**

**Dmitry:** Oh, that's a difficult question. I think it depends more on what to do on this date. It would be cool to skydive with Stortia, and to go see Venice with Paulina. With Augusta – to the Cannes Film Festival, with Tori – to feed squirrels and hedgehogs)

**(25) Was there any other name for Gladiator Chronicles during the development of the story? Or did you immediately decide to name it that way?**

**Dmitry:** There were many options that were thought up and discarded. Initially, the project was called ""New Rome"" between us)

**(26) Will there be a male makeup?**

**Dmitry:** I had thoughts about male makeup. It is important to say that makeup and beards are a rather labor-intensive process. Artists need to adapt EVERY drawn emotion to EVERY beard/makeup. That's why I use such opportunities sparingly)

**The following are questions from subscribers :)**

**(1) I'm interested in the following: is there a religion in the world of Gladiator Chronicles? And if so, who is their God?**

**Dmitry:** There are a large number of worlds in Gladiator Chronicles, each of which, due to natural circumstances, has one or another religion or belief system. This is an incredible cultural mix. Just think – if there are a huge number of religions and beliefs on Earth alone, imagine what will happen within the Cosmos?)

**(2) A question about Cassius' youth: Was Cassius a monogamous man, or was he rather a kind of Casanova?**

**Dmitry:** This man deceived, seduced, caroused, humbled himself, fought, betrayed, was himself betrayed, loved, used. His life is a constant chaos and movement)

**(3) How soon can we expect the branches to close? And is it worth worrying about paid improvements with other favorites (LIs) besides your own?**

**Dmitry:** Yes! Everything will be decided in August. I found a great moment that would be justified from the point of view of the plot, and at the same time, it seems to me, it looks quite organically in the context of what is happening.

**(4) Has humanity had contact with other races? Can we see aliens?**

**Dmitry:** No, I didn't plan on aliens in the story) Gladiator Chronicles are more about the immutability of human nature and aspirations, which after thousands of years remain the same as they were long ago. Introducing aliens would have shifted the focus)

**(5) There are a lot of questions about who let Rix go home. For example, if Labelle did it, would it have any effect on his relationship with Augusta?/Paulina on the branch (if you’re pursuing them)?** 

**Dmitry:** I planned to make this decision the main one in building further relations with LIs, but since this idea was not implemented by me as I would have liked, the impact, of course, will be, but not so decisive. Wait for August)

**(6) The story is extremely variable, and this is simply amazing. Are there many different endings in it? And also, will we see at least one large-scale battle in space?**

**Dmitry:** There will be two global finales - the actual plot finale and the actual individual finale with each LI.

Battles in space are a very complex and epic thing, it seems to me at the moment that it is more about the visual component than the text. I think about it all the time. I want to believe that in the near future my subconscious will give me an idea on how to implement such an episode.

**(7) Does Augusta remember her mother? Should we expect the beautiful woman to tell us about her relationship with her family?**

**Dmitry:** Augusta is a tough nut to crack. Rix will have to try very hard to get through to such confessions)

**(8) How much power do the clerics have? Are they like a council and equal to Caesar or do they still obey him?**

**Dmitry:** The Order of the Clerics is an elite organization reporting directly to the Supreme Pontiff, who is Caesar's subordinate. They are a kind of standard-bearers and heralds of New Rome and technological progress all rolled into one)

**(9) Can LIs die during the story, depending on Rix's choices?**

**Dmitry:** Not in the written and released chapters yet, but who knows what awaits us ahead ;)

**(10) Tell us about the characters' hobbies. We know about Labelle, and the others?**

**Dmitry:** Wait, everything will gradually be revealed)

**(11) Many are interested in the promised blonde girl. Will she be a LI? Or just a (side) character?**

**Dmitry:** Everything has its time)

**(12) Orvon and Afiy have already shown jealousy, but will there be a similar reaction from Cassius' children?**

**Dmitry:** Oh, yes!

**(13) Will Cassius' reaction to Rix's relationship with one of his children be shown? And will it be possible to pair Tori with someone?**

**Dmitry:** Yes, in August, Cassius will show his attitude in all its glory :D I will think about this possibility. So far, the plans are to pair one lovely lady and an equally wonderful man.

**(14) Will we have the opportunity to dress up the LIs in other clothes for diamonds, like in other stories? And is it worth waiting for gifts from them?**

**Dmitry:** Yes, in the upcoming update it will be possible to dress up some of the Flavians)

**(15) How densely populated is Blore? Are there cities there or just the villa of the Flavians?**

**Dmitry:** This is a very small planet, which Cassius loved with all his heart. He very convincingly asks no one to settle there :D

**At the end of a wonderful interview, Dmitry answered a small blitz survey :)**

**(1) Summer or winter?**

**Dmitry:** Mid-spring and mid-autumn)

**(2) A lark or an owl?**

**Dmitry:** Why choose if you can sleep during the day and be both a lark and an owl?)

**(3) Tea or coffee?**

**Dmitry:** Used to be tea, now coffee.

**(4) The sea or the mountains?**

**Dmitry:** Combination)

**(5) Theater or library?**

**Dmitry:** Theater.

**(6) Detective or fantasy?**

**Dmitry:** Oh... Why are the questions on the blitz so difficult?.. So far fantasy, let's hope that detective will follow))

**(7) Chocolate or chips?**

**Dmitry:** Cheesecakes!

**Thank you very much for your answers and for the interesting conversation)**

Had last gotten an hbA1c during COVID which was 6.1, since i caught the virus and the docs ordered a full checkup. Post COVID, didn’t do anything to help it along. 

But now that im trying to work my way back into health, i’ve hit the gym 6 days a week for the past month. Am on a calorie deficit. Actively counting calories. Lost 8KGs in the first month with a lot of self-enforced discipline. Have cut out sugar from my coffee, but also have chais at work. Was kind of delaying checking my bloodsugar till i’d past the first month. 

Got a full panel bloodwork done two days ago and saw that my hbA1c has gone to 6.3. Gave me the shivers, but makes sense at the pace i was stuffing high-octane crap in my mouth. 

- Is there an advisory on how much sugar to limit myself on per day?
- Can it even be reversed from this stage? 
- Have an impossible sweet tooth but have been relying on fruit for this past month. Or limited to a couple of dates for a post dinner sweet. Does this work?
- Should i get one of those active monitoring blood glucose patch thingies?

I’ve been monitoring my symptoms since then and it seems to be POTS as they suspect (120-130 hbpm on what I call “bad body days” while doing basic tasks involving standing or walking and heat intolerance being the most common). 

So I was trying to part my hair to do some twists when suddenly my body started going wonky (dizzy, nauseous, eyesight going a little wiggly, overall feeling like I was gonna keel over and die) which usually lets me know my body is struggling. So I’m currently laying curled in a blanket with my window open for cold air, munching on a piece of bread and sipping a bottle of water, but I only barely made it to the kitchen and back to bed before my bodily mutiny took me out. I was just wondering if this is a common thing with POTS. I was just working on the top and back of my head and I have coily/kinky hair so my arms were up for a over 10-15 minutes but I’m not sure if this was the cause or the fact I had coffee for breakfast and fell asleep before making dinner last night. Any tips on mitigating this? Is this common? Am I just gonna have to leave my hair alone because my body hates me today? 
Any shared experiences or help would be appreciated, because I’d really like my body to behave normally instead of going AWOL when I really need to do something",1,1739802624.0,POTS,2,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1irl25q,https://gofund.me/ff6b7fcd,The time my apartment got burned down and my cat was killed by my upstairs neighbors vindictive ex,"On November 7th, 2024, I headed home for lunch as I always did. I would use my hour lunch to take a break and clear my head by playing a little bit of Baldurs Gate 3 and hanging out with my kitty of 14 years. When I was normally greeted by happy meows and chirps from my cat Lily, instead I was greeted by fire trucks, police tape, and my entire life in ash. Turns out, the night before, shortly after saying goodbye to my kitty and giving her treats and pets,  I left for my girlfriend's house (also named Lily, I call them my bouqet) the ex of the tennant above me decided to get revenge on him by pushing in my window ac unit, dumping gas all over my couch and my thousands of magic the gathering cards on the coffee table, and igniting the life I had just began building with the love of my life and the kitten that helped me get through so much since my early teens. 

I wasn't able to get closer than 5 feet from the front door as it was an active crime scene with the ohio fire marshal conducting his investigation. The first thing I asked was what about my cat? Please tell me she survived. She had not, luckily not touch by the flame, but taken by the smoke. I was her person, the only one she ever really bonded with, and I will never be able to forgive the guilt of not being there for her final moments. Lily was a 1 year old cranky old lady. One of those cats that you know will live to 20 out of sheer spite for the world. She came alive when she became a one animal house cat, I was even able to hold her without losing copious amounts of blood. She was my light, she was my little girl, and she was adopted so fast by my girlfriend Lily. Every time I snuggled with them, or human Lily annoyed cat Lily with love, I could not believe how much it made my heart soar. Now, my little girl is a box of ash and bag of hair on my shelf, her paw print receiving a place of reverence on the christmas tree this year. These things provide none of the warmth and love of my old kitten, but I swear I still feel her hop up on the bed as I'm waking up, ready for treats and love and to yell at me as I leave for work. 

While things are ultimately replaceable, everything I had was lost in the fire. Cherished bits and bobs that wove a tapestry of some of my best times and memories. Two of my grandpa's hats next to the signed album of my favorite band who I met while wearing his ""super grandpa"" hat which had the band laughing and striking up conversation with me. The teal Gameboy color my grandparents gave me and one of the only things I had of them. All of my magic the gathering and DND materials that I used to take my friends to far off worlds and wage epic battles together. My 3d printers that I used to literally shape the world around me. T shirts and clothes from countless trips made by myself or others. Things that I was able to look at and have them take me back to some happy time or joyous memory.  

Renters insurance covered a bit, at least a bed and necessities, but I was also forced to take time off work to process the grief caused by this event. I decided to continue this leave and officially resign to become a substitute teacher while working on my second bachleors degree in teaching. In the mean time, I started door dashing to cover my bills. I loved this, and was making the same money I was before, but ended up having to take out a loan to cover rebuilding expenses. I have a 2000 jeep cherokee that I call donkey and loved driving around doing deliveries and listening to podcasts. I was happy, I was making good money, and I was finally starting to feel stable again. I pleaded with the universe, please, do not take this jeep from me. I love my car, it doesn't matter what make or model or how old. It was always my safe space while living at home and the freedom and autonomy my car represents means so much to me and my mental health. I was told the cherokee engine from this era was unkillable. Well, I guess I find bad luck like a squirell finds a nut. What I thought was a cracked intake manifold turned out to be a total engine failure. Not only was this a stop to my income, it was a loss of the final bit of my old life that I was desperately clinging to. 


This was the final straw on the camel's back that was my mental health. I struggled with chronic depression and incredibly self destructive thoughts for so long. Then, at the end of 2023, I finally got it under control and began living my life as I wanted to. As someone who is stable enough to be a smile for anyone who needs it. This random arson attack from someone I had never even seen before in passing made me backslide into my old state of mind. While I still see life as worth more than anything and I still retain my dreams for human Lily and I's future, I'm at rock bottom in my hope of climbing back up out of this valley. 

And now we come to today. I took a semester off to focus on myself and rebuild, but I am now stuck without any idea of what direction to head. I'm ready to start being a substitute teacher, but I have no transportation to get there. Because of the loan I had to take, I am not approved for the financing on the engine swap, totaling around $6200. I can afford the payments, but can't get approved for them. In a spiraling pit of despair, I thought ""maybe a reddit community could help"". A thought i laughed off, but one that stuck with me. I am reaching out now desperate for help and at the bottom of the barrell of options. Please help me repair my car so I can return to stability, and continue my dream of educating the next generation. I am attaching the link to a go fund me my sister set up and the police report as well. If you could please share the go fund me link on a social media account, or help directly, I can finally get my life back on track. Thanks
