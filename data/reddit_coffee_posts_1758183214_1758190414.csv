1nk4bfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeRoasting/comments/1nk4bfr/coop_in_ottawa/,Co-op in Ottawa,"Hi all,

I’m based in Ottawa and roast about ~34 kg/year at home. Right now I’m exploring the idea of starting a local green coffee buying co-op so hobbyists and small roasters here can access bulk imports.

Concept:
Pool demand → order full bags (60–70 kg) from importers.
Split down into 5–20 kg portions for members.
Lower per-kg costs + more variety than hobby pack pricing.
Local pickup in Ottawa to avoid shipping fees.

Would anyone in the Ottawa/Gatineau area be interested in joining something like this? Even just a handful of us could make a first bulk order happen.

However, it was a known thing amongst the workers at this place that the van was a total disgrace, and while I saw the state it was in, I didn't think I would be there long. My mangers and higher ups pretty much know the state of the van as they have to go in there to collect any cash we make so the mould is there and its been there and i have tried everything to keep my work space as clean and hygenic as i can since i have been there alot longer than i anticpated because finding another job has been quite hard. that being said i have gradually been getting sicker and sicker and it's not been something easy to spot. it started with hand tremours which scared me into thinking i had a brain tumor but my MRI was clear, then i kept getting flare up of psirosis and now i have gone down to 47kg and i have NEVER been this skinny in my life i look awful and im so sick i just dont know what to do the doctors have no idea what it is. I saw someone talk about their experience with mould sickness, and I am so beyond scared because everything matches up. I have taken the week off to get my health under control, but I really don't think it's in my best interest to go back. I have bills and rent to pay. Is there anything I can do for some sort of compensation, or just maybe a bit of help? I've looked into Fair Work, but they say they can't help with work conditions, or maybe I'm not looking into it correctly, and to be quite honest, my brain feels like mush; I can't really think properly. I even thought I was maybe going through some sort of psychosis because of how crazy my head has felt. It's black mould by the way. I know that me saying my mental state isnt the best right now might seem like all crediablity of this situation goes out the window but my life is actually going well right now besides this so I just have no idea what to do im so scared and sick and I really hate that this is happening because ive made some really amazing friends at this place but I'm tired of putting myself last in life this is my literal final straw.

# Brewing Methods

Finding the best coffee without chemicals involves more than just selecting organic beans. The brewing method plays a crucial role in maintaining the purity and flavor of your coffee. Using traditional brewing methods ensures you get a rich, chemical-free cup every time. Let’s explore two popular methods: French Press and Pour Over.

# French Press

The French Press is a classic brewing method known for its simplicity and full-bodied flavor. Using a French Press ensures that you get the most out of your coffee beans without introducing any unwanted chemicals.

Here are the steps to brew coffee using a French Press:

1. **Measure Coffee:** Use a 1:15 ratio of coffee to water. For example, use 1 ounce of coffee for every 15 ounces of water.
2. **Grind Beans:** Use a coarse grind. It should look like sea salt.
3. **Boil Water:** Heat water to about 200°F (93°C).
4. **Add Coffee:** Place the ground coffee in the French Press.
5. **Add Water:** Pour hot water over the coffee grounds.
6. **Stir:** Stir the mixture gently.
7. **Steep:** Place the lid on and let it steep for 4 minutes.
8. **Press:** Press the plunger down slowly and evenly.
9. **Serve:** Pour the coffee into your cup and enjoy.

The French Press method is ideal for those who prefer a richer, more robust flavor. It allows the natural oils from the coffee beans to remain in the brew, enhancing the taste.

# Pour Over

The Pour Over method is another excellent way to brew coffee without chemicals. It gives you more control over the brewing process, allowing you to extract the best flavors from your coffee beans.

Follow these steps to make Pour Over coffee:

1. **Measure Coffee:** Use a 1:17 ratio of coffee to water. For example, use 1 ounce of coffee for every 17 ounces of water.
2. **Grind Beans:** Use a medium-coarse grind. It should resemble sand.
3. **Boil Water:** Heat water to about 200°F (93°C).
4. **Prepare Filter:** Place a paper filter in the dripper and rinse with hot water. This removes any paper taste.
5. **Add Coffee:** Put the ground coffee into the filter.
6. **Bloom:** Pour a small amount of hot water over the grounds to bloom. Let it sit for 30 seconds.
7. **Pour Water:** Slowly pour the remaining water in a circular motion over the grounds.
8. **Serve:** Once the water has passed through the coffee grounds, pour the coffee into your cup and enjoy.

The Pour Over method highlights the delicate flavors of the coffee. It provides a clean and crisp cup, free from chemicals. This method is perfect for those who appreciate a lighter, more nuanced coffee experience.

# Flavor Profiles

Choosing the best coffee without chemicals is about more than health. It’s also about taste. Flavor profiles in coffee vary widely. They depend on the roast level. Understanding these profiles helps you pick the perfect cup. Let’s explore the distinct flavors of light and dark roasts.

# Light Roast

Light roast coffee is known for its bright and vibrant flavors. The beans are roasted for a shorter time. This keeps more of the original taste of the coffee bean. Here are some key characteristics of light roasts:

* **Acidity:** Light roasts have a higher acidity. This gives a tangy taste.
* **Flavor Notes:** You can taste fruity and floral notes. Common flavors include citrus, berries, and jasmine.
* **Body:** The body is light and tea-like. It feels thinner on the palate.
* **Aroma:** The aroma is often sweet and fragrant.

|Characteristic|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Acidity|High, tangy|
|Flavor Notes|Fruity, Floral|
|Body|Light, Tea-like|
|Aroma|Sweet, Fragrant|

Light roasts are often preferred by those who enjoy a more complex and nuanced coffee. They offer a refreshing and lively cup. Perfect for those who appreciate the diverse flavors of the coffee bean.

# Dark Roast

Dark roast coffee offers a different experience. The beans are roasted longer. This brings out deep and rich flavors. Here are some characteristics of dark roasts:

* **Acidity:** Dark roasts have lower acidity. The taste is smoother and less sharp.
* **Flavor Notes:** You can taste chocolate, nuts, and caramel. Some dark roasts have smoky or spicy notes.
* **Body:** The body is full and heavy. It feels robust on the palate.
* **Aroma:** The aroma is strong and bold.

|Characteristic|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Acidity|Low, Smooth|
|Flavor Notes|Chocolate, Nuts, Caramel|
|Body|Full, Heavy|
|Aroma|Strong, Bold|

Dark roasts are ideal for those who enjoy a robust and intense coffee. The flavors are rich and deep. Great for those who love a strong, full-bodied cup. A comforting choice that delivers a powerful coffee experience.

# Choosing The Right Beans

Choosing the right beans is crucial for enjoying the best coffee without chemicals. The type of bean you select can significantly impact the flavor and quality of your coffee. Here, we explore some factors to consider when choosing your coffee beans.

# Arabica Vs. Robusta

When selecting coffee beans, you typically have two main types to choose from: Arabica and Robusta. Each type offers unique characteristics that can affect your coffee experience.

**Arabica:**

* Known for its smooth, mild flavor.
* Less bitter than Robusta.
* Contains less caffeine.
* Generally grown at higher altitudes.

**Robusta:**

* Stronger, more bitter taste.
* Higher caffeine content.
* More resilient to pests and diseases.
* Typically grown at lower altitudes.

Choosing between Arabica and Robusta depends on your preference for taste and caffeine content. Arabica beans are often favored for their smooth and complex flavors, while Robusta beans are preferred for their strong and bold taste.

|Characteristics|Arabica|Robusta|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Flavor|Smooth, Mild|Strong, Bitter|
|Caffeine|Less|More|
|Growing Altitude|Higher|Lower|

# Freshness Matters

Freshness is a key factor in achieving the best coffee without chemicals. Freshly roasted beans provide a richer and more vibrant flavor compared to stale ones.

**Signs of Fresh Coffee:**

* Aromatic smell.
* Bright and lively flavors.
* Beans with a shiny, oily surface.

To ensure your coffee stays fresh, consider the following tips:

1. **Buy whole beans:** Whole beans stay fresh longer than pre-ground coffee.
2. **Store properly:** Keep beans in an airtight container away from light, heat, and moisture.
3. **Grind as needed:** Grind beans just before brewing to preserve their freshness.

By focusing on freshness, you can enjoy a coffee that is not only free from chemicals but also bursting with natural flavors.

# Storing Coffee Properly

Coffee lovers often seek out the best coffee without chemicals. But, did you know that storing your coffee properly is just as important? Proper storage ensures your coffee stays fresh and pure, enhancing your overall experience. Let’s dive into some essential tips for storing your coffee properly.

# Avoiding Contamination

One of the biggest threats to your coffee’s purity is contamination. Even the best coffee can lose its quality if not stored correctly. Here are some tips to avoid contamination:

* **Use airtight containers:** Always store coffee in airtight containers. This prevents exposure to air, which can cause oxidation.
* **Avoid plastic:** Use glass or ceramic containers. Plastic can absorb odors and chemicals, which can transfer to your coffee.
* **Keep away from strong odors:** Coffee beans can absorb odors from their surroundings. Store them away from spices, cleaning products, and other strong-smelling items.

Here’s a table summarizing the best storage containers:

|Container Type|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Glass|Non-reactive, odor-resistant|Can break easily|
|Ceramic|Non-reactive, durable|Can be heavy|
|Metal|Durable, airtight|Can react with coffee|

By following these tips, you can keep your coffee free from contamination, ensuring a pure and enjoyable cup every time.

# Maintaining Freshness

Freshness is key to a great cup of coffee. To maintain the freshness of your coffee, consider the following:

1. **Store in a cool, dark place:** Heat and light can degrade coffee. Keep your coffee in a pantry or cupboard, away from sunlight and heat sources.
2. **Buy whole beans:** Whole beans stay fresh longer than ground coffee. Grind only what you need for each brew.
3. **Avoid the freezer:** Freezing coffee can cause moisture to build up, which affects the flavor. Instead, store coffee at room temperature.

Here’s a quick tip: Always check the roast date on your coffee. Freshly roasted beans are best used within two weeks. If you can’t finish your coffee within this time, consider buying smaller quantities more frequently.

By implementing these storage practices, you can maintain the freshness of your coffee, enhancing its natural flavors and aromas. Remember, the way you store your coffee can significantly impact its taste and quality. Happy brewing!

This section provides consumer tips to help you make informed decisions. Learn how to read labels and understand certifications that guarantee chemical-free coffee.

# Reading Labels

Reading labels is crucial when selecting coffee without chemicals. The information on the label can reveal a lot about the product’s quality and safety. Here are some key points to look for:

* **Country of Origin:** High-quality coffee often comes from regions known for their coffee production, such as Colombia, Ethiopia, or Brazil.
* **Roasting Date:** Freshness matters. Choose coffee with a recent roasting date for the best flavor and quality.

Additionally, be wary of vague terms like “natural” or “gourmet.” These words are often used for marketing and do not guarantee the absence of chemicals. A well-detailed label reflects transparency and trustworthiness, making it easier to select a safe and high-quality coffee.

1nk46yo,https://v.redd.it/3ivdhv6mbwpf1,Air hissing sound,"Helloos! Recently got this beast and was very excited about it. Bought a good grinder for it etc. But now i'm trying do dial in different coffees, and no matter what i try or do (apart from grinding waaay to coarse), i always hear air hissing when I am pumping. Now this is a sound I never hear in YT videos etc, and im pretty sure something is not entirely right. Can someone please think with me what it could be?

The people at Wacaco are not particularly helpfull or willing to think along, hopefully you guys are :). Because I am afraid this is preventing me from pulling shots even slightly correctly... If i grind coarse, it pulls to fast (and still hisses), if i grind finer it takes just too long to pull a shot (always nearing a minute). It tastes all right, but flavours could be better en extraction not looking too nice (beans are a little on the old side though). 

But besides all that, i just hate the hissing sound because it makes me think something is wrong.

  
So summary:

Strange hissing sound, shots take too long (even with right grind or slightly coarser), pressure is probably not building enough due to air leak and leading to long pull times",1,1758189815.0,picopresso,0,1.0,False

From primetime K-Dramas to billion-dollar blockchain moves, crypto is popping up in places you’d never expect. Whether you’re new to the space or just catching up, here’s what made waves this week.

# K-Drama puts Crypto Mania on Prime-Time TV

A new Korean drama, “To The Moon,” will premiere on Friday. It will spotlight retail crypto investors chasing wealth through the 2017-2018 bull market. 

At the [press conference](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20250916092500005), a female cast member said she had purchased about $360 (KRW 500,000) worth of Ethereum years ago but still holds it because she never figured out how to withdraw it.

The drama airs on MBC, South Korea’s leading free-to-air public broadcaster known for producing nationwide hits such as “Coffee Prince” and “Dae Jang Geum.” The Friday-Saturday 10 pm slot is one of the network’s prime-time positions, guaranteeing broad exposure nationwide.

It will also be available via streaming in Taiwan, Indonesia and India.

The plot follows three low-income women working at a large confectionery company. Stressed out with stagnant office jobs, they turned to cryptocurrency during the nation’s first major bull run, when regulations were minimal and news outlets reported on students and retirees investing their savings in digital assets.

South Korea’s cryptocurrency market continues to expand, recording daily trading volumes of about $3.15 billion. It consistently ranks among the world’s largest markets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum proving especially popular among younger investors.

# Circle partners with Hyperliquid for USDC expansion

Native Markets has [secured](https://x.com/fiege_max/status/1967262690444984463) the USDH stablecoin ticker on Hyperliquid (HYPE), winning almost 70% of validator votes in Hyperliquid’s first major on-chain governance process.

Despite competition from established players like Paxos, BitGo, and Ethena, Native Markets emerged as the obvious frontrunner throughout the weeklong campaign. 

Furthermore, Circle has announced a partnership with Hyperliquid, bringing USDC integration to the blockchain. The stablecoin issuer is bringing Native USDC and CCTP V2 on HyperEVM.

https://preview.redd.it/kfyj9q7qbwpf1.png?width=981&format=png&auto=webp&s=678ddd9797b0260fefebcf7639b1f2074888f1b4

The company plans to make this a long-term collaboration, offering new tools for Hyperliquid developers. Also, Circle may become an ecosystem validator in the future, as it’s already a stakeholder.

Now, the important question is: will the USDH rule USDC?

With the launch of USDH, Circle’s USDC, the dominant dollar-backed asset on the network, is facing fresh competition. Still, a massive amount in USDC reserves remain on the platform, emphasizing its comfortable position.

Nonetheless, Hyperliquid has made it clear that USDC and other stablecoins will keep being supported as quote assets. However, they have to meet requirements like a 200,000 HYPE stake (about $10 million), a strong peg to $1, and sufficient liquidity depth against both USDC and HYPE.

Overall, this partnership can be mutually beneficial for both firms and the broader industry. Circle is the second-largest stablecoin company, but this Hyperliquid deal shows its commitment to being an industry leader.

# Google unveils AI agent-to-agent crypto payments protocol

Google has [unveiled](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-agents-to-payments-ap2-protocol) its newest contribution to the AI sector, an agent-to-agent payments protocol. This open-source platform will allow AI agents to transact directly without human oversight.

The tech giant has created a new platform for AI agents to interact directly through financial transactions. Google’s new protocol focuses on agent-to-agent payments, aiming to make the firm a vital piece of the growing AI infrastructure.

James Tromans, the Head of Web3 at Google Cloud, claimed to reporters,

“The way we built it is from the ground up to factor in both heritage and existing payment rail capabilities as well as forthcoming capabilities such as stablecoins.”

The firm partnered with over 60 companies, aiming to maximally integrate payment options.Currently, the protocol allows payments in debit and credit cards alongside some USD-backed stablecoins. This could also expand to other cryptoassets in the future. 

Google engaged in a huge level of collaboration for this AI development. Coinbase, which facilitated the first AI-to-AI crypto transaction, was named as a major contributor alongside firms like Salesforce, American Express, Etsy, and more.

With the degree of investment, optimism is high that things operate smoothly for all sorts of transactions. Google is quite committed to the AI sector, but this update shows real experimentation.

If Google’s efforts prove successful, it could ensure the tech giant’s position in a novel sector of an explosive market.

# Solana TVL hit $13 billion ATH

The Solana network has experienced a surge in user demand and network inflows, resulting in its decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) reaching an all-time high of over $13 billion.

As buying activity grows, SOL’s price has also surged nearly 25% in the past week. What matters now is whether this wave of network growth will be sufficient to propel the altcoin back to record price levels.  

According to DefiLlama, Solana’s DeFi TVL is at an all-time high of $13.38 billion, having skyrocketed by 18% in the past week. This surge is a clear marker of increased capital inflows into Solana’s DeFi protocols, a trend that can only be sustained when there is a rise in user demand and on-chain activity.

Data from Artemis confirms this trend, showing that Solana has experienced an uptick in daily active addresses and transactions. According to the on-chain data provider, in the past week, for example, the number of daily active addresses involved in at least one SOL transaction has increased by 37%.

The increase in users has directly translated to higher activity, as the daily transaction count on the network has climbed 17% over the same period.

https://preview.redd.it/10w9ph7vbwpf1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a3e9f69837ee84eff9d242de5820e2443c4c050

When a network’s user demand increases this way, it signals stronger confidence in the ecosystem and deeper utility for its native asset. With the Solana network showing strength, attention now shifts to how these gains are reflected in SOL’s market performance.

# Ethereum nears $5,000 as ETFs reshape market demand

Ethereum (ETH) has jumped by nearly 10% over the past week, driven by improving market sentiment and renewed investor demand. 

The price surge comes as a broader risk appetite returns to the crypto market, raising hopes that ETH could be gearing up for a breakout toward the $5,000 mark.

Ethereum’s Exchange Supply Ratio (ESR) has plunged to its lowest level this year, indicating that fewer coins are being held on centralized exchanges. As of this writing, the metric is at 0.14, falling steadily since July 20.

https://preview.redd.it/670qipfybwpf1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ac6f17ac78193259c400d0132e3cced5110e78c

The ESR measures the share of ETH’s circulating supply on centralized exchanges. A higher ESR signals that more ETH is sitting on exchanges, increasing the risk of near-term selling pressure.

Conversely, when the ESR declines, as it has now, it indicates that holders are moving coins off exchanges, often into private wallets or custodial solutions. This reduces the immediate availability of ETH for sale.

Historically, such declines in exchange balances have often preceded extended rallies, raising the likelihood of a rally toward $5,000 in the near term. 

Furthermore, institutional confidence is showing signs of revival. Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which saw capital outflows last week, have recorded a rebound in inflows in the past few days.

https://preview.redd.it/83smils1cwpf1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=e53e7ef2ca8f40f8d898ccff8a6e189a15458601

According to SosoValue, between September 8 and 12, spot Ethereum investment funds recorded $638 million in capital inflows, a sharp reversal from the $788 million in outflows the previous week.

The turnaround reflects a decisive shift in sentiment, with key investors rotating back into ETH and strengthening the case for a sustained push toward the $5,000 level

Furthermore, Ethereum staking activity is locking up more ETH than ever before. Data from CryptoQuant showed that Ethereum investors have locked up an additional 2.5 million ETH since May, pushing the total amount of staked ETH to 36.2 million. Per Dune Analytics data, this represents nearly 30% of Ethereum’s total supply.

https://preview.redd.it/tcfehsn4cwpf1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdc38963005bc18966dd59ab15eaa2caf5d124c0

This steady increase reduces the top crypto’s circulating supply and reinforces its upward price pressure. It also signals that investors are committed to ETH for the long term and not short-term speculative plays.

Another strong piece of evidence showing that Ethereum’s market role has significantly changed is the acceleration of its on-chain utility. According to CryptoQuant, Ethereum’s daily transactions spiked to 1.7 million in mid-August, and the number of active addresses on the network reached a high of 800,000.

https://preview.redd.it/1b5wz8u8cwpf1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=b864409273c4ee408a2405836b835615678ff30f

All the same time, smart contract calls broke past 12 million per day, which is an unprecedented level in prior cycles. The activity level underscores Ethereum’s growing role as the backbone for decentralized finance, stablecoins, and tokenized assets.

# Base emerges as a major L2 contender

Coinbase-backed Layer 2 network Base is accelerating its ascent into the upper echelons of Ethereum scaling solutions. It continues to lead on multiple metrics, including weekly transaction counts and daily active addresses.

With a total value locked (TVL) of $5 billion, a stablecoin market cap of $4.5 billion, and daily revenues of $100,000, the project is now positioning itself as a serious contender in the increasingly competitive L2 ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/feiabfvbcwpf1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9e60072f136ea638637fa907c54e739185835a2

The activity reflects Base’s push to capture everyday on-chain behavior. From decentralized swaps to creator payments, the network is increasingly being used as a foundation for practical, user-facing applications rather than just liquidity mining or arbitrage.

Furthermore, Base’s team has emphasized its growth flywheel, designed to attract builders, creators, and users. This approach also advertises Base as a platform for growth and funding. This differentiates it from other Layer-2s focused primarily on transaction throughput.

https://preview.redd.it/fx1jt9yecwpf1.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2dc736e2d55cc06df794f7cbe47cd479328b2f6

The most eye-catching announcement from the BaseCamp event was the launch of a new bridge to Solana. Described as a way to move seamlessly across ecosystems, the bridge will enable users to trade assets across chains.

They could also deploy tokens in both ERC-20 and SPL-20 formats and tap into Solana’s liquidity within Base applications. Users can deposit and use SOL in Base apps, import any Solana token, and export Base-native tokens back to Solana.

Alongside the Solana bridge, Base also confirmed it is exploring the launch of a network token. In an update, the project said it is still in the early phases of exploration and has not yet provided specifics on timing, governance, or design.

# Zypto Integrates Hive for Gas-Free Global Payments

Hive users now have a new way to manage their crypto and spend globally, thanks to Zypto’s latest integration. The v1.21 app update introduces full support for [**HIVE**](https://zypto.com/defi-crypto-wallet-app/hive/) and [**HBD**](https://zypto.com/defi-crypto-wallet-app/hive/), enabling gas-free transfers, full wallet functionality, and access to Zypto’s real-world payment ecosystem.

Users can now:

* Create or link a Hive account directly inside the Zypto App
* Send, receive and pay with HIVE and HBD without network fees
* Use their balances to pay bills, top up mobile phones, or fund crypto cards, all in-app

The Hive blockchain, known for its speed and fee-less design, powers a growing ecosystem of creators, apps, and communities. By adding Hive, Zypto expands its mission toward a more open and decentralised economic system – one where networks like Hive, decentralised to the core, are fully supported.

The integration includes full support for:

* Hive account linking and management
* Fee-free P2P transfers
* Payments in HIVE/HBD across Zypto features
* Swap access between HIVE, HBD and 24,000+ assets

Zypto’s community-led approach continues to attract diverse chains and user bases. Hive joins a growing list of supported networks inside the [Zypto App](https://zypto.com/defi-crypto-wallet-app/), including [Ethereum](https://zypto.com/defi-crypto-wallet-app/evm-blockchains/), [Solana](https://zypto.com/defi-crypto-wallet-app/solana/), [Base](https://zypto.com/defi-crypto-wallet-app/base-chain/), [XRP](https://zypto.com/defi-crypto-wallet-app/xrpl-ripple/), [Tron](https://zypto.com/defi-crypto-wallet-app/tron-trx/), and more.

# Closing remark

The current buildup of stablecoins on exchanges has been noted as an “extremely strong bullish signal.” Analysts remark that this capital is poised to be deployed into assets such as Bitcoin and altcoins, signaling that a powerful rally may be on the horizon.  
  
Retail participation and spot market volumes will still play a role in sustaining Solana’s momentum. If buying activity from smaller players still stalls, even whales might hesitate to drive the price higher.

Overall, it seems likely that the exchange reserves jumped, not due to panicked investors selling, but exchanges buying more XRP. In fact, this could be a sign of institutional coordination for an upcoming event.

Ethereum’s rally toward the $5,000 mark is reframing its role in global markets. The asset is transitioning from a speculative token into a reserve choice for institutions and large-scale investors.

With billions flowing through its ecosystem, real user adoption, and now a cross-chain bridge that expands its reach, Base is positioning itself as a central player in Ethereum’s scaling wars.

And with fee-free HIVE and HBD transfers now live in Zypto, Hive’s role as a decentralised, user-driven network is stepping into the spotlight, not just as a blockchain for creators, but as real infrastructure in a more open financial future.

Tried LMNT first because everyone here worships it. 1000mg sodium at 7am on empty stomach. by 7:30 I'm having hunger pangs worse than day 1 of fasting. stomach growling like I haven't eaten in a week

The salt bomb triggers digestive enzyme production. learned this the hard way. your gut thinks food is coming and starts the whole digestive process. completely defeats the autophagy benefits
tested it for 2 weeks:

Days 1-7: LMNT at 7am = hungry by 8am, broke fast early 5/7 days

Days 8-14: Plain water = normal hunger at noon, completed all fasts

Tried liquid IV next (mistake). the sugar obviously breaks fast but even their ""sugar free"" version has maltodextrin which is LITERALLY a glucose polymer. how is that fasting safe??

Recently tried a premium brand with way less sodium (450 mg) and my stomach didn't revolt. not sure why it works better... maybe because it uses sea salt instead of whatever industrial shit is in the others? What matters is it doesn't make me want to eat my desk at 9am.

First, note that the portafilter is filled with used Espresso grounds. That's why the colour is like that, and it drips and flows so much. I just want to show the behaviour of the machine. It behaves like that with fresh grounds.

Issues:

Short pressing the button seemingly starts Preisfusion, but stops after 1 sec or so. Every time.

My workaround has been long pressing the button for about 2 seconds. Then Extraktion starts but I think the pre infusion is not there or too short. When I make an espresso like this, first a gush of about 15 g espresso comes out relatively quickly before it slows down an ""drips like honey"" like it should and you see in videos online. (Again, in this video I just show the behaviour of the machine with used Espresso, so it comes out too fast. I can't seem to find an option to add a second video to show it)

I read online, you can manually control pre-infusion by holding down the button for longer, then release it. However, if I do that, after about 4 seconds or so the machine just stops. (See video)
If I hold down the button an don't let go, the machine also stops after like 4 sec. So the ONLY way to get espresso out for me, seems to hold the button for about 2 sec, not longer since then it won't work, and short pressing won't work either. That can't be normal, right?

I mean, the pump seems to be working, and I never had any issues with the steam wand.

1nk40cd,https://i.redd.it/wenosa8yawpf1.jpeg,Is peeing every 2 hours normal?,"Most people wonder if running to the washroom every couple of hours is normal. The truth? For some, it might be okay — but for others, it could be your body waving a red flag.

Let’s dive into when frequent peeing is fine, when it’s not, and what to do about it.

# So, Is It Normal?

* On average, peeing **6–8 times a day** is considered normal.
* If you drink a lot of water, coffee, or energy drinks, going every 2 hours might be expected.
* But if it happens even when your fluid intake is average, it could point to an underlying issue.

# Common Reasons Behind Frequent Urination

# 1. Your Drinks Matter

* Caffeine and alcohol act as diuretics — making your bladder work overtime.
* Even too much plain water can push you to the restroom more often.

# 2. Lifestyle Habits

* Night owls who sip tea or soda late might see frequent trips at night.
* Stress and anxiety also make your bladder more active.

# 3. Medical Conditions

* **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI):** Often brings burning, urgency, and pain.
* **Diabetes:** Excess sugar in the blood makes kidneys produce more urine.
* **Overactive Bladder:** Bladder muscles contract even when not full.

# When to Worry

* If frequent urination disturbs your sleep.
* If you feel pain, burning, or see blood in urine.
* If you notice a sudden increase without lifestyle changes.

At this point, consulting a specialist is key. [Dr. Sachin Patil](https://urologistnearme.in/), experienced Urologist in Pune, explains that while occasional extra bathroom trips can be harmless, persistent frequency often needs evaluation to rule out conditions like diabetes, kidney issues, or bladder problems.

# How to Keep Your Bladder in Check

# 1. Track Your Fluids

* Keep a diary of how much and what you drink daily.
* Notice patterns that trigger frequent peeing.

# 2. Bladder Training

* Delay bathroom visits slightly to stretch the gap.
* Over time, this strengthens bladder control.

# 3. Diet Choices

* Cut down on caffeine, spicy foods, and fizzy drinks.
* Focus on balanced meals that don’t irritate the bladder.

# 4. Stay Active

* Exercise keeps your body’s metabolism in balance.
* Pelvic floor exercises can improve bladder strength.

# Finding the Right Help

If frequent urination starts affecting your daily life, don’t brush it off. A quick search for a trusted [Urologist near me](https://g.co/kgs/nHZr6sE) can connect you to the right specialist who can run simple tests and give clarity.

Remember, your bladder is like your body’s alarm system — when it changes its rhythm, it’s worth paying attention. With proper guidance and timely care, most bladder issues are manageable.

# Final Takeaway

Peeing every 2 hours can sometimes be normal — but not always. The key is to notice patterns, watch out for red flags, and not ignore discomfort. If it’s persistent, let a professional check it out.",2,1758189139.0,Healthandlifetips,0,1.0,False
1nk3yxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1nk3yxy/so_i_became_his_dead_ex_to_destroy_him/,So I Became His 'Dead' Ex to Destroy Him,"For three whole years, I pretended to be Ethan Parker's girlfriend—only to realize, too late, that I'd actually fallen for him.  
  
Just as I was working up the nerve to tell him I was pregnant, I overheard Brittany—the girl who'd always had it out for me—talking to him.  
  
""Thanks for faking amnesia to help me get back at Olivia,"" she said. ""One hundred pranks, and I'll go out with you.""  
  
My whole world came crashing down.  
  
I was nothing more than a pawn in his twisted game to win over Brittany—his unrequited crush.  
  
So I died in a staged plane crash.  
  
Ethan searched the wreckage like a madman until he found a single ring, engraved with the words: ""Prank 100: I bet you love me.""  
  
They say he cried until he passed out and woke up in the hospital consumed with rage toward everyone involved in the pranks.  
  
Meanwhile, I stood in the French Alps, burning my fake death certificate, a faint smile touching my lips.  
  
He faked amnesia to break my heart. I faked my death to break his.  
  
Brittany's voice, sickly sweet, drifted through the wall. ""Ethan, prank 96—success!""  
  
Ethan's reply was cold, unfamiliar. ""Having fun, Brittany?""  
  
""Getting back at Olivia for stealing your scholarship and that game design award. Duh,"" one of his buddies chimed in.  
  
""Just four more, Brittany, and Ethan's all yours!"" another voice shouted.  
  
My blood ran cold.  
  
""Ethan's a genius. Who would've thought of faking amnesia just to mess with Olivia?""  
  
""That time we made her search for her bracelet in the pouring rain… priceless! And then he gave it to Brittany!""  
  
My mom's jade bracelet. The one she gave me on her deathbed. The one Ethan ""lost"" when he moved. I'd searched for seven hours in a downpour and ended up with a 104-degree fever.  
  
""And remember her thesis defense? Ethan told her he got jumped at a bar.""  
  
They roared with laughter. ""She ran to the bar, found nothing, and ended up begging her professor not to fail her! We got it all on video.""  
  
I bit my lip until I tasted blood.  
  
I'd missed my thesis defense—a project I'd poured six months into—for nothing. I had to postpone graduation because of it.  
  
Brittany giggled. ""And that time he folded her game design—the one she'd slaved over for three nights straight—into a paper airplane. She was like a stray dog, picking up the pieces all night.""  
  
""So what's the plan for this one?"" Ethan asked.  
  
""Tell her you're in the hospital. Tell her to rush over. Then we all go party and leave her hanging!""  
  
My phone buzzed. A message from Ethan: ""City Hospital, ER. Come quickly.""  
  
I slipped away before anyone noticed.  
  
Two minutes later, he retracted the message. A pang of guilt, maybe?  
  
I played along like I'd never seen it.  
  
I already knew the truth.  
  
I'd stumbled upon a hidden folder on his phone labeled ""Game Progress,"" filled with 96 videos—one for each cruel prank.  
  
The password? Brittany's birthday: 12/24.  
  
The same day he claimed he first met me.  
  
The same Christmas Eve I waited for him in the snow for three hours while he was at Brittany's birthday party, placing a crown on her head.  
  
That night, he'd wrapped a scarf around my neck—so tender, so caring.  
  
A wave of nausea hit me. I opened his meticulously kept chat log with Brittany.  
  
""Told her I was working late. Took you to Disneyland. She waited until 3 am.""  
  
""Told her her competition time was two hours later. She ran out in her pajamas. Hilarious!""  
  
The last entry was from the night of our class reunion. Brittany had ""accidentally"" spilled scalding coffee on me. Ethan shielded me instantly.  
  
But the chat log read: ""Disgusted even to touch her. Used three bottles of sanitizer.""  
  
I called my dad. Told him I wanted to join him in Paris.  
  
He'd moved there five years ago, after Mom died. He'd always wanted me to come, to study abroad. I'd refused. I stayed for Ethan.  
  
I thought I could melt his icy heart. I forgot that melted ice leaves only bone-chilling cold.  
  
""My sweet girl,"" Dad said, his voice full of relief. ""You finally figured it out.""  
  
""Yeah,"" I choked out, tears welling.  
  
""Dad,"" I said, ""when I leave, I need you to stage a plane crash.""  
  
He didn't understand, but he agreed.  
  
A plane crash. My final gift to Ethan Parker.  
  
I deleted every photo of us. While packing, a leather-bound journal slipped out from Ethan's safe. Embossed on the cover was the phoenix logo from my game, Ashes of the Realm—the initial design I'd spent 36 sleepless nights perfecting.  
  
Ethan had printed it. The book was filled with my design drafts, meticulously collected, with notes wishing me success.  
  
Page seven held a photo of me, glasses perched on my nose, deep in code. A sticky note beside it read: ""She called the developers 'frazzled cats' today. Her revised plan is ten times better. Such an adorable genius.""  
  
He'd been there those nights I pulled all-nighters—massaging my shoulders, cooking me ramen. He'd run out at 3 am for cake just because I'd mentioned craving it. He remembered my period, always ready with hot ginger tea and heating pads.  
  
This ""love prank""? He was falling for it, too.  
  
The last page held a crumpled plane ticket stub from last Valentine's Day. His handwriting filled the margins: ""If I had to choose again, I'd still pretend to lose this ticket, trick her into staying up all night with me to revise the proposal. Brittany wanted this. Prank 72.""  
  
Rain lashed against the window. All that love, built on a lie. He might have cared, but he cared more for Brittany. I was just a tool.  
  
I scheduled an abortion.  
  
That night, Ethan came home smelling like winter. I pretended to sleep.  
  
He paused. I hadn't reacted to the prank. He must've lost face in front of Brittany and his friends. Why wasn't he pushing it?  
  
The mattress dipped. Strong arms wrapped around me.  
  
He nuzzled his face against my neck, his breath warm on my skin. ""We're having a baby, Livvy Moon.""  
  
Livvy Moon. His nickname for me. Like the moon, shining only for him. Close to my real name, Olivia. But I knew he called me ""pretentious"" behind my back. Livvy Moon was a joke. Another way to make a fool of me.  
  
I stayed silent. He didn't know about the abortion.  
  
He pulled out my pregnancy test—three little hearts drawn on it in pen. My pen. The Montblanc I'd bought him with my first paycheck. The one he carried.  
  
I didn't respond. He hugged me tighter, whispering sweet nothings. My heart stayed frozen.  
  
""I'm tired. Let's sleep.""  
  
He went quiet, obedient. ""Tomorrow, we're going to Brittany's birthday party,"" he murmured before drifting off.  
  
I lay awake all night.  
  
He built a game of amnesia; I gave him three years of my heart.  
  
I'd stage a death, and he'd spend the rest of his life regretting it.  
  
At the party, Ethan's friends surrounded me, shoving the biggest slice of cake in my face.  
  
""Ethan says he loves watching you eat sweets.""  
  
Ethan looked away, feigning disinterest.  
  
The cake tasted bitter. My stomach churned.  
  
Brittany pushed the cake closer. ""Olivia, don't be rude. It's my birthday! Unless… you're nauseated by me?""  
  
A sharp pain ripped through my abdomen.  
  
They laughed, reveling in my discomfort.  
  
I stumbled to the bathroom, violently ill. Their laughter echoed through the door. Another successful prank.  
  
""Still have that stomach bug?"" Ethan offered me a glass of water with mint leaves—an old remedy he'd taught me when we first met.  
  
I couldn't answer. The pain intensified—needles stabbing my insides.  
  
I looked down. Blood. So much blood.  
  
""Take me to the hospital,"" I whispered, clutching his arm.  
  
Brittany blocked the door, giggling. ""It's just spotting. Totally normal. Don't overreact, Ethan.""  
  
""Get out of the way!"" Ethan roared.  
  
The first time he'd ever challenged her.  
  
I woke up to Brittany's whiny voice outside the room. ""Too much of the… you know… stuff? Wasn't it just supposed to be embarrassing?""  
  
One of the guys laughed. ""Getting rid of that little bastard's a bonus. Ethan should be thanking us.""  
  
""Yeah. Three years is enough. What if she'd kept it? How would he ditch her then?""  
  
Ethan's voice, low and strained. ""Pranks are pranks. You don't mess with her health.""  
  
Brittany's voice turned shocked, then angry. ""Who was it that said he'd help me 'teach that nerd a lesson'? Who wanted to humiliate her as my birthday gift? Don't tell me you've fallen for her.""  
  
A long silence. Then, ""Never. You know I love you.""  
  
Laughter erupted again.  
  
Prank 98: Complete. They were already plotting number 99.  
  
I touched my now-flat stomach. The dull ache lingered. We were just part of their sick game—a birthday present for Brittany.  
  
I cancelled the abortion. There was no need.  
  
The baby's father had already made the decision.  
  
I was about to call my dad when Ethan walked in. I feigned sleep.  
  
His voice, thick with guilt, brushed against my ear. ""Olivia, I'm so sorry…""  
  
The reason went unspoken.  
  
When I was discharged, Ethan said his friends and Brittany wanted to apologize. They invited me to hike up Cheaha Mountain. There was a temple at the top, a place to pray for our lost child.  
  
I knew it was probably another prank. But the thought of the baby…  
  
This would be my goodbye.  
  
They fawned over Brittany, ignoring me.  
  
At the prayer tree, Ethan bought a wooden plaque for us to write the baby's name together.  
  
Brittany smiled sweetly. ""You're such a good mom, Olivia.""  
  
I ignored her fake sympathy.  
  
The tree was crowded. I had to lean over the railing to hang the plaque. Someone shoved me hard from behind.  
  
""Aaah!""  
  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
A sudden, violent force ripped through me. My leg... I couldn't move.  
  
Everything went black.  
  
Then, Ethan's arms were around me, lifting me up. His eyes were red and swollen.  
  
""Livvy Moon, don't worry. I'll get you to a hospital.""  
  
""Why?"" I whispered, my vision swimming with tears. ""Why are you doing this to me?""  
  
The wound was on the outside, but my heart was the one that felt completely shattered.  
  
His voice shook. ""I didn't know they'd do that, Olivia. I swear…""  
  
Then, nothing.  
  
I woke up with my leg trapped in a heavy plaster cast. The doctor said the damage might be permanent. Hot tears spilled down my cheeks.  
  
Ethan was right there beside me, his face etched with deep worry. He drew a tiny moon on the cast. ""Livvy Moon,"" he whispered. ""I'll be here until you're better.""  
  
I closed my eyes, and he gently tucked the blanket around me, moving as if I were made of the most fragile glass. He fussed over me, fetching anything I could possibly need, running back and forth for almost an hour before he finally settled into his chair.  
  
The perfect, attentive boyfriend.  
  
The one who had orchestrated my downfall.  
  
I pretended to sleep, my heart hammering out a painful, frantic rhythm. Ethan stayed up the entire night, keeping watch over me.  
  
He kept kissing that little moon on my cast, his own tears flowing freely. He held my hand so tight, as if he were afraid I might vanish.  
  
""I'm so sorry, Livvy Moon. It's all my fault. I should've never listened to them. I should've never hurt you.""  
  
""I'm glad I still have a chance. I won't ever hurt you again. You're my everything, Livvy Moon.""  
  
""I almost lost you. I'm so sorry.""  
  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
He watched me all night, and I could feel the weight of his gaze. He was in pain because I was hurt—he'd even told them not to mess with my health.  
  
For a second, I almost let my guard down. Almost. Then it hit me—how delusional I was being.  
  
Ethan's true loyalty? It always went back to Brittany.  
  
Prank 99. I was still just a pawn in their twisted game. He let it happen. Again.  
  
What's stopping him from being part of Prank 100?  
  
While he was out grabbing breakfast, I called my dad. The bodyguards were already on their way. It was time to put the ""plane crash"" plan into motion.  
  
Then Brittany showed up. Smug. Gloating.  
  
""Olivia, breaking your leg? That was my idea. Prank 99.""  
  
I stared back, my breath catching in my throat.  
  
She looked me over, adjusting her designer shawl like she owned the room.  
  
""Prank 100? The Realm competition. You're going down for plagiarism. Ethan handed over all your Ashes of the Realm levels. He even bribed the committee. Your submission will be timestamped three minutes after mine. Get ready for public humiliation.""  
  
Realm. The biggest game design competition in the country. Two years of my life—all those levels, saved on my laptop.  
  
I slapped her. Hard. ""Stealing my work. Chasing after my boyfriend. You'll always be a second-rate version of yourself, Brittany.""  
  
Her eyes turned sharp. She grabbed my wrist, hand raised to hit back. ""You're the one settling for secondhand things now!""  
  
But the slap never came.  
  
""Brittany, what the hell are you doing?"" Ethan stood in the doorway—my dad's bodyguards right behind him.

Even Ethan believed I'd never fight back.

So when he brought another woman into our territory, I smiled. 

I handed him a folder and watched him sign his name without reading it.

He didn't know he was signing our divorce.

He didn't know his Luna made a deal with his mother, secretly moving out of his life.

Let him keep the mistress. 

I'll take back my freedom.

And wait to see his face when he knows the truth.



May 8, 2023, my Alpha Mate, Ethan Hawthorne brought his mistress to our pack, and I decided to deceive him into divorcing me.

Standing in front of his office, I took a deep breath, knocked on and stepped inside.

The polished wood door swung closed behind me with a soft click.

I clutched the file in my hands , forcing a mechanical smile to my lips as I approached his desk. Ethan didn't glance up. His focus remained on the laptop screen.

""Are you busy?"" I asked, my voice even, polite.

He looked up, his gray eyes meeting mine without any flicker of warmth.

""A bit,"" he said, voice low and rough. He leaned back in his chair. I placed the folder on his desk, already flipping to the marked pages where his signature was needed.

""Just a few spots to sign.""

Without reading, he picked up the pen lying next to his laptop and began to sign, page after page, his hand moving automatically, his gaze occasionally drifting back to his screen.

I watched silently. Ethan looked…worn out. His usually sharp grey eyes were dull, and there were deep shadows under them. He had just come back from London after two weeks at the Annual Alpha Conference — a gathering of pack leaders across the globe.

But he hadn't come back alone.

My wolf Yve stirred uneasily inside me.‘He reeks of her.'I pushed her down gently. There was no point in flaring up.Not when the papers he had just signed held the ending we both needed.

When he was finished, he clicked the pen closed and slid it across the table toward me.

""Thanks,"" I said, sliding the documents back into my folder.

I paused, hesitated, then asked, ""Will you be home for dinner tonight?""

Predictably, Ethan shook his head. ""Got some things to wrap up here. Don't wait.""

I nodded, plastering the same empty smile across my face. ""Got it. See you around, Alpha,"" I said, forcing my voice to sound like any other obedient wolf under his rule—not like the Luna and fated mate he seemed to have regretted claiming.""

I turned away, letting my smile fade once my back was to him.

My heels clicked softly against the hardwood floor as I walked toward the door.The air shifted slightly when I passed the annex lounge, and Yve immediately bristled.

‘Smell.'Sweet vanilla perfume — too sweet.I glanced sideways without thinking, my enhanced senses sharpening the image beyond what human eyes would see.

Half a box of artisanal pastries sat abandoned on the low glass table. A lipstick-smeared coffee cup beside it. And near the plush lounge chair, a black high-heeled shoe.

Yve snarled deep within me, the sound more a vibration across my bones than a true noise.‘He brought her here. Here. Not just to London. To our den. Our Pack. He stains our space.'

My throat tightened painfully.

My chest felt heavy, like something was sitting right on top of it as I turned on my heel and head back, away from this awful place that made me feel disgusted.

By the time I got back to my office, exhaustion hit me hard. I dropped into my chair, not even bothering to turn on the lights.

Slowly, I pulled out the divorce agreement from the lowest drawer—the very document Ethan had just unknowingly signed.

My fingers brushed over his perfect signature.

Firm. Bold. Unwavering.

Just like the way he had pledged himself to me during the mating ceremony years ago. Back then, Ethan had been so firm, so sure. He looked at me like I was his whole world. I had believed it, like a fool.

That familiar scent I sniffed earlier—I knew exactly who it belonged to. I'm smarter than this. I should've seen it coming.

I could still feel the phantom brush of his lips against the mark he placed on my neck.

I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the ceiling. I could almost hear Ethan's mother Amelia's voice again— calm, cold, and cutting. ""Don't be naive, Olivia. Men—even Alphas—always want more. They don't stay faithful.""

A bitter laugh escaped my lips. ""You were always spot on, Amelia,"" I muttered.

I realized then that I had been wrong. So, so wrong.

Not only had Ethan cheated, but he had taken his mistress to our office.

‘We deserve better', Yve whispered.

‘We do', I agreed.

Steeling myself, I picked up my phone, snapped a clear photo of the signed divorce agreement, and attached it to a new message.

To: Amelia HawthroneSubject: Agreement CompleteMessage: Ethan has signed, as per our understanding.

I hit send without hesitation.

The previous week, Amelia had approached me in private.If I agreed to file for divorce quietly, without confronting Ethan or exposing the affair publicly, she would ensure a settlement of $150 million transferred discreetly to my personal accounts.

In the world of packs and politics, image was everything. An Alpha embroiled in a public scandal would weaken the Hawthrone Pack's standing — something Amelia would never allow.

Neither would I, truthfully. No matter how broken Ethan had left me, I would not humiliate myself by causing a spectacle.

I had my dignity.

After a month — the grace period to finalize everything — Ethan would be free.And so would I.

I let out a slow breath, settling into my chair. That's when a knock came at the door.

""Come in,"" I said.

Ethan's beta, Reed stepped inside, carrying a small, elegant box in both hands.

""Luna Olivia,"" he said formally, not quite meeting my eyes. ""Alpha Ethan asked me to deliver this to you. He bought it for you during his trip to London.""

Reed placed the box on my desk and I flipped the lid open.

Inside, nestled on deep blue velvet, was a gleaming diamond set — necklace, earrings, bracelet. The same set I had seen in a photo...on her.

Disgust crawled up my throat.

""Alpha Ethan mentioned he... he picked it out personally. Wanted something special for you."" Reed added quickly, like the words might make it hurt less.

I forced a smile, tucking the box back into my desk drawer like it meant nothing.

""How thoughtful of him,"" I said. ""Even with his busy schedule and all"" I said lightly, my tone dripping with sarcasm.

Reed flinched slightly. ""I should get back,"" He was slipping out, leaving the door swinging shut behind him with a soft thud.

My eyes dropped back to the jewelry sitting on my desk, gleaming under the harsh office [lights.My](http://lights.My) stomach twisted in disgust.

Without wasting another second, I snapped a photo of it and forwarded it to a second-hand luxury dealer.Me: Donate the full amount to the werewolf orphanage fund.

I shut the box with a click, wiping my hands like I'd just handled garbage. Because, honestly, that's what it felt like.

By five in the evening, I was wrapping up, gathering my things, and heading to the parking lot.The day had drained me, but it was the kind of exhaustion that sat deeper than muscles or bones.

As I stepped outside, the wind shifted, carrying a familiar scent.Leather. Musk. Vanilla.

My eyes narrowed instinctively.

That's when I spotted Ethan's car, parked near the exit.

Through the window, I caught a glimpse—Ethan, sitting in the back seat.

And right beside him, a vibrant blonde, laughing like she didn't have a care in the world.

Reed was behind the wheel.

The second he saw me, he slammed on the brakes, hard enough that the car jolted.

For a heartbeat, everything went still.

My eyes locked with Ethan's through the glass.





\###Chapter 2

Olivia's POV

I recognized the blonde girl sitting close to Ethan — it was Chole Windsor, the daughter of the Alpha of the second-largest pack in the United States.

She didn't even pretend to be subtle. Her eyes found mine across the lot, but she made no move to step away from Ethan. Instead, she draped her arms over his shoulders, leaned in, and whispered something in his ear. He didn't stop her.

I looked away. Got into my car, turned the engine, and drove off without sparing them a second glance.

I hadn't been home for long. After slipping off my shoes at the entrance, I made my way upstairs to the walk-in closet, the quiet of the pack house settling around me.

I was standing in front of the wardrobe, picking out a necklace — something simple to go with tomorrow's blazer — when I heard a car pull into the gravel driveway outside.

I didn't need to look to know who it was.

A moment later, I smelled someone behind me.Ethan.

I didn't turn around. Just clasped the necklace and set it back in its place.

""Are you upset?"" he asked.

""Obviously,"" I said, still not looking at him. ""You should be careful next time.""

He didn't respond right away. I heard him exhale through his nose. ""The Windsor pack's Alpha wants to collaborate with us. I've been talking to Felix, their eldest Alpha-in-line. Chole is his sister.""

I nodded slightly and turned to face him. ""So to secure the alliance, it's necessary to wrap your arms around his sister in public?""

His jaw flexed. He didn't answer immediately. For a moment, he just looked at me like he didn't expect to be questioned. Then his voice hardened.

""I'm trying to explain, Olivia. Watch your tone when speaking to your Alpha.""

I stared at him for a second.

""You don't need to explain anything to me,"" I said. ""If you're tired of me and ready to name someone else as Luna, say so. I'll leave.""

His face darkened. ""What did you just say?""

I didn't flinch. ""I said we can get a divorce and break the bond.""

I stepped past him, but he grabbed my arm. His hand shot up to my chin, gripping it just enough to hold me still without bruising.

""Don't ever say that again,"" he said, voice low.

I didn't respond. Just met his eyes for a beat too long before pulling away.

But inside, I already knew — I wasn't saying it for effect.

I'd been thinking about divorce for weeks. Preparing for it in quiet ways. I didn't want him anymore.

Ethan stayed home that night. Sat in the Alpha's private office most of the evening, didn't eat dinner. It was well past midnight when he finally got a phone call that made him leave. I wasn't close enough to hear everything, but I caught a woman's voice on the other end — crying.

The next morning, my phone lit up with a message from my friend Ava — a lawyer. She had sent me a screenshot of Chole's latest post.

It was a photo taken at sunrise, from the top of some mountain trail. Two hands clasped together, fingers interlocked.The caption read: ""Enjoy the sunrise, feel your heartbeat.""

I stared at the photo.

One of those hands was Ethan's. I'd know that scar near his thumb anywhere.

I sat holding my mug for so long the water went cold. Only when I set it down did it make a sound.

The following days, Ethan didn't return home.

At work, we saw each other only during meetings. He sat at the head of the table, and I stayed on the side with the executives. We barely made eye contact. I didn't go upstairs to his office, and he didn't come down to mine.

In the evenings, I started browsing house listings — somewhere small, outside the city. I also started clearing out the closet. Anniversary gifts. Jewelry. Even the wedding ring. All of it went to resell platforms or donation. They didn't mean anything to me anymore.

One evening around 11 p.m., Luna Kate from SilverFang pack texted me out of the blue, inviting me to join her at a club. We were not very familiar—I'd only met her a few times when I attended the Pack Summit with Ethan. She was very good at greeting anyone with her fake smile. Her Alpha husband was frequently caught up in scandals, and now she started to be a social butterfly as well.

I almost said no. But then I remembered — if I really left the Hawthorne Group, I'd have to build something on my own. Might as well start moving.

""Sure,"" I texted back.

When I got to the Moonfell, Kate met me near the entrance. She linked her arm through mine like we were best friends.

""Glad to see you Olivia,"" she kissed my face. No one but our inner circle knew Ethan and I were married. They always called me Olivia and thought we were just a rumored couple with mate bond.

""Me too,"" I tried to fake smile.

She led me upstairs and into a large room that was divided by a decorative wooden screen.

There were people on the other side — laughing, drinking, talking loud — but Kate brought me to this side, quieter, with just one woman sitting alone. I recognized her vaguely. Mate of someone in Ethan's circle. She smiled at me — tight, awkward.

I took off my coat, sat down, and Kate disappeared a moment later.

I picked up a drink, sipped it once, and then I heard it.

My name.

From the other side of the screen.

""She hasn't been seen with Alpha Ethan much lately, huh?""

""Well, of course not. He takes Chole Windsor everywhere now.""

""She's the daughter of the second biggest Pack Alpha in the country. Obviously, she's a better fit. Makes the Pack look stronger.""

""Still, Olivia and Alpha Ethan were together what — eight years? He's probably tired of her even though they are mates.""

There was a pause. Then a chuckle.""Shame. She wasted her best years. I'd still take a go at her, though.""

The cup froze in my hand.

I recognized the voices. Two of them belonged to the sons of the Gamma and Delta.

The woman beside me shifted uncomfortably.

I stood up. She looked startled, maybe thinking I was going to leave.

Instead, I cleared my throat, picked up my drink, and stepped around the screen.

The laughter faded when they saw me.

I leaned casually against the edge of the divider, my drink in hand. I looked at the one who'd spoken last.

""Isn't it a bit unfair?"" I asked. ""You make it sound like I've been living off him.""

They blinked.

I took a sip.

""Ethan was a vigin before we got together. So if I've been using him to satisfy my needs for eight years without paying — sounds like I got the better deal, doesn't it?

Silence. The whole room had gone still.

Most of them just stared— and then widened when they looked at someone behind me.





\###Chapter 3

Olivia's POV

I smelled it. I turned around, and there he was.

Alpha Ethan.

I glanced at him, then looked past him to the low velvet sofa behind. Chole Windsor sat there, legs crossed, glass in hand.

Her smile was gone. The way she stared at me —her eyes flashing with the territorial aggression of a she-wolf ready to defend her claim — made it clear she would've ripped my throat out if she could get away with it.

That's when it clicked.

This wasn't some coincidence. They were here together. Chole, Ethan, and their usual circle — people I once thought of as allies. This was their private little gathering. From the way they talked earlier, it clearly wasn't their first. They didn't even care to hide their relationship. Maybe they never had.

Ethan walked toward me.

Behind him, the group scrambled back to life. One of them stepped forward quickly. ""Olivia, we were just messing around—none of it was serious. We were just talking nonsense.""

Another added, ""Really sorry. We didn't mean anything by it.""

I didn't respond.

Ethan reached for my wrist.

""Let's go,"" he said, already trying to pull me out of the room.

I didn't fight.

Instead, I grabbed my drink and threw it in his face, a clear challenge in the presence of his pack.

The room fell into complete silence again. Someone gasped. I could hear the ice clink against his cheek as the liquid ran down his jawline.

I smiled faintly, ""Please, Alpha, continue enjoying yourself with your beloved. I won't interrupt again.""

Then I lowered my head, tried to pull my hand back from his.

His grip only tightened.

His face had gone dark. Without another word, he bent down, grabbed me, and threw me over his shoulder like a sack.

I kicked instinctively. ""Ethan—put me down!""

He didn't respond.

We walked into the hallway, and I struggled on his back, but Ethan didn't loosen his grip.The elevator had just arrived on the floor. As he stepped inside and turned around, my upside-down view caught a pair of polished black leather shoes. Then black suit pants, long legs, and pale hands — each finger slender, the joints sharp and defined.

The air felt still. Quiet but awkward.

Ethan walked out of the elevator just as I looked up — and met a pair of deep, steady eyes.

Sharp and captivating.

They held mine for a second too long. I looked away, suddenly embarrassed to be seen like that. Slung over Ethan's shoulder like some helpless object.

Suddenly, Yve stirred inside me, her instincts sharpening, the primal awareness of another strong wolf nearby sparking her curiosity.

I didn't know why I felt that way. But I didn't like it. It unsettled me.

Ethan dragged me out of the club and down the steps to his car. He opened the back door, tossed me in, and climbed in himself.

My head spun. Being carried upside down and then thrown like that.

He grabbed a wet wipe from the glove compartment and began wiping his face silently.

Then he finally spoke. ""Why were you there? You came to catch me, didn't you?""

As he wiped his cheek, I noticed something just behind the tissue box.

A foil wrapper — gold, neatly tucked behind the tissue box.

A conndom.

The sight of it made my stomach turn. I looked away immediately and reached for the door handle.

""I'm not staying in this car,"" I said.

He pulled me back roughly. ""Where do you think you're going?""

""Home,"" I said, my breathing uneven. ""I want to go home.""

""Stop making trouble, Olivia. My patience is running out.""

I didn't answer. Just sat there, breathing hard.

""Harold!"" Ethan called out toward the club. ""Drive.""

Harold came out a minute later, nodded, and got into the front seat.

The ride was silent. I stayed pressed against the farthest side of the car, arms crossed, staring out the window.

By the time we reached the house, I opened the door and got out before the engine had fully stopped.

Inside, I went straight to the kitchen and poured a full glass of ice water. I drank all of it in one go.

Only then did I feel something close to normal.

When I walked back out, Ethan was sitting in the living room. I didn't ask why.

I sat down across from him.

It was quiet for a while. Then he said, ""I was there to talk business. A new project.""

I said nothing.

""You showing up and making a scene like that — it embarrassed me.""

He kept going. ""You looked ridiculous. Screaming, throwing drinks. Like a jealous shrew.""

I stared at him.

He looked back at me, like he expected me to deny it.

""Is that all?"" I asked.

His brows drew together. ""If you want our relationship to work, you need to stop being paranoid all the time. I don't have time for your insane suspicions.""

I nodded. ""Got it. Anything else?""

He stared at me. ""Do you know how annoying you are right now?""

I stood up slowly.

He won't be annoyed much longer.

I went upstairs, changed into pajamas, and got into bed without another word.

He came up about an hour later and found me already asleep.

After showering, he got into bed quietly. I turned my back to him and inched closer to the edge, making sure our bodies wouldn't touch.

That didn't stop him.

He hugged me from behind and yanked me back into his arms, rough and without a word. He was tall, his Alpha strength undeniable, the raw power of a pack leader. With barely any effort, he held me in place, his grip unyielding, making it clear that resisting would be pointless.

I spent the night stiffly, barely moving.

By morning, I hadn't slept at all. I went downstairs and made breakfast for myself — toast, boiled eggs, a glass of milk. I sat alone at the dining table and started eating in silence.

Ethan came down a little while later, dressed for work. He glanced toward me but didn't say anything at first. He walked halfway to the door, then stopped. A few seconds passed before he turned around and walked over.

He leaned in close to my ear.

""This weekend,"" he said gently, ""let's go out to sea. Just the two of us. Clear our heads a little.""

I took a sip of milk and replied without looking at him. ""Hmm.""

That was it.

On Friday, he broke the promise.Said he had to fly to London for a project. An urgent meeting, supposedly.

I wasn't surprised. I didn't feel anything — no disappointment, no anger. Just nothing.

Maybe he hasn't noticed we haven't shared a meal in weeks. We don't talk. We don't go anywhere. We don't spend time like people in a marriage — not even like people who live under the same roof.

He says divorce is out of the question, but I already feel like someone who doesn't exist to him.

If I disappeared tomorrow, I genuinely doubt he would even notice.

Over the weekend, I started moving books out of the study. Stacked them into a suitcase and took them to my new apartment. The place was smaller. Simpler. But it felt like mine.

While I was organizing the shelf, my phone rang.

Melina.

I hesitated, then picked up. ""Hello, Luna Melina."" Ever since I married his son eight years ago, she still asks me to call her luna.

She snorted arrogantly. ""Come over now. We need to put down in writing what we discussed earlier.""

I paused. ""Is that really necessary?""

She didn't hesitate. ""If I say so.""

""Fine. I'll go back this afternoon,"" I answered.

Yet, she wasn't satisfied. ""Come back at noon.""





\###Chapter 4

Olivia's POV

I arrived at Hawthorne Manor around 11 AM.

As I approached the main entrance, a sweet, overly cheerful voice drifted out through the partially open windows.

""Yay! I won again!"" The girl's tone was playful, but there was a flirtatious edge to it, the kind meant to tease a lover. ""Are you letting me win on purpose, Ethan?""

I paused, my hand hovering over the door handle. I didn't need to see her to know who it was.

Chole Windsor.

I realized the real purpose of Melina, she wanted to humiliated me.

I took a slow breath, letting Yve's quiet growl settle in my chest, then pushed open the door and stepped inside.

Ethan was in the living room, his head turning sharply when he caught sight of me. For a moment, his eyes flickered with surprise, quickly masked by a flash of annoyance. ""What are you doing here?""

I walked in, slipping my sunglasses off and tucking them into the pocket of my loose white T-shirt. I hadn't bothered with makeup today, just jeans and a comfortable shirt. I met his eyes,""Your mom didn't tel you? She called me."" I continued, ""Didn't know you were back from London so soon. Or are you a magician now, managing to be in two places at once?""

His jaw tightened, a flicker of guilt flashing in his eyes. He didn't respond.

Before he could recover, Chole stood up from the plush velvet sofa. She brushed an invisible speck of dust off her thigh, showing off her perfectly manicured fingers.

""Hi,"" she extened her hand, stepping closer with a bright smile. ""I'm Chole Windsor. It's nice to meet you.""

I looked at her outstretched hand for a second, then deliberately ignored her.

Melina entered the room. She wore a tailored black dress, her hair swept back in a flawless chignon, a perfect image of power and control. Her eyes moved over me briefly before settling on Chole.

""Chole, darling,"" she said, taking Chole's hand in both of hers,""I hope you're having a good time today. Make yourself at home. This is your house too.""

I felt a muscle in my jaw tighten, but I kept my face neutral.

Melina's eyes flicked to me, her expression cooling instantly.""Ah, Olivia. You're here.""

She turned back to Chole, her tone still warm.""This is Ms. Hawthorne, the manager of the Hawthorne Group. She's here on business.""

It took every ounce of self-control not to roll my eyes. She made it sound like I was just another employee, someone here to deliver a report, not the Luna of the pack or her son's wife. It was a subtle dismissal, a deliberate way to tell Chole that I was no threat.

I ignored her, my eyes drifting back to Ethan. He didn't even try to defend my position.

""Didn't you say we had business to discuss? Let's get it over with.""

Melina's smile tightened slightly.""We can discuss it another day. You're here now, so why not join us for a meal?""

I exhaled slowly, already tired of this charade.""I'm not here for a meal, Melina. I have other things to do.""I turned to leave, my back already to them.

Her voice sharpened,""I am still the pack luna, Olivia, and I have asked you politely to stay. What is this attitude of yours? No manners at all.""

I paused, my hand stilling on the back of a leather chair. I turned slowly, meeting her icy stare with one of my own.""Fine. I'll stay for a meal.""I met her gaze without blinking.""Just make sure you don't regret it.""

Chole, sensing the tension, quickly tried to lighten the atmosphere,""Oh, that's perfect. I was just telling Ethan how much I enjoyed winning our little game of Silver Moon Toss earlier. I'd love to keep playing.""

I glanced at the balcony where a polishedSilver Moon Tosstarget stood, several delicate gold rings stacked neatly beside it. I hadn't even noticed it before. Clearly, it was something new — probably Chole's idea.

Silver Moon Tosswas a light social competition often played atwerewolf gatherings. The rules were simple — players took turns tossing three golden rings, trying to encircle the movingMoon Pillarfive meters away. It required precision and rhythm, often used to showcase coordination between couples.

Chole's eyes lit up when she saw me looking at the ring toss setup.""Oh, Olivia, do you know how to playSilver Moon Toss?""

I met her gaze, catching the hint of challenge behind her bright smile.""Only a little,""I replied, letting my eyes linger on her for a beat.""Wanna play?""

Ethan's jaw tightening as he shot me a warning look.

""Of course. Shall I go first, or would you like the honor?"" Chole adjusted one of the gold rings on the table, her confidence flaring.

""Go ahead. I'll watch."" I stepped back, casually folding my arms.

Chole's smile widened, clearly pleased with herself. She stepped into position, her posture perfect, each movement precise. She took a steadying breath, then flicked her wrist. The golden ring sliced through the air, narrowly missing the Moon Pillar, landing just a few centimeters off.

She turned back to me,""Almost nailed it.""

Behind her, Melina's eyes followed the ring,""Chole. So graceful.""

Chole gave a appreciative nod, clearly loving the praise.

I didn't bother with any of the theatrics. I stepped forward, picked up a ring, and tossed it without much thought. The ring cut through the air cleanly, glinting in the sunlight before slipping perfectly around the Moon Pillar with a clear, satisfying clink.

Chole's smile froze for a second, her fingers tightening around the ring she still held. She forced a thin, strained smile.""Lucky shot.""

I let a careless smile spread across my lips, leaning back slightly.""Maybe.""I shrugged,""Last time I played this was at the Alpha Foundation dinner with Ethan.""

The remark hit its mark. Chole's face tensed, her grip on the ring tightening as she prepared for the next throw.

Melina stepped in quickly,""Dear, it's just a game. The important thing is to have fun.""

I shrugged, stepping back.""Of course. But some people get carried away too easily.""

I didn't miss the way Melina's eyes flicked to Ethan, a silent accusation in them.

In the next few rounds, I almost hit every ring, each one sliding smoothly around the Moon Pillarwith a clear, satisfying clink. Meanwhile, Chole's throws grew increasingly off-target, her rings clattering against the base or falling short entirely.

I noticed the slight tremble in her fingers as she reached for another ring, her forced smile tightening with every miss, her eyes flashing with barely concealed frustration.

Melina's expression grew more strained with each missed attempt, her jaw clenching tighter every time I hit my mark. She glanced at Ethan, as if hoping for some intervention, but he remained silent.

I stepped back, dusted my hands lightly, then walked to the nearby sofa. I set my final ring down on the polished side table, folding my hands neatly in my lap, my eyes meeting theirs without flinching.

""Want to keep playing?""I asked, my tone light, almost bored.

Chole's hand curled tightly around the last ring, her knuckles turning pale, lips pressed into a thin, strained line.

Melina shot me a sharp, furious look, her eyes narrowing into thin, dangerous slits.









\###Chapter 5

Olivia's POV

""Come on, one more,""Chole said, trying to hide the frustration in her eyes.""I'm just getting warmed up.""

I glanced at her, then at Ethan, who still hadn't said a word. Melina watched from the side, clearly annoyed but not stepping in.

""Sure,""I replied, picking up another ring, my tone casual.""Let's keep going.""

We kept playing. I hit the pillar again. And again. Chole's throws grew wilder, her aim less precise, her confidence visibly cracking. Melina's eyes darted between us, her polished exterior slipping as her face twisted into an increasingly sour expression. She glanced at Ethan, clearly expecting him to intervene, but he just stood there.

I picked up my final ring, tossed it with a casual flick of my wrist, and it spun neatly around theMoon Pillaronce more.

Chole's forced smile finally shattered. Her eyes filled with tears, and a small, broken sound escaped her throat. She clutched the last ring tightly, her fingers shaking, then let it clatter to the ground as she stumbled toward Ethan.

Ethan stepped forward, his face hard, eyes cold. He snatched the gold ring from my hand, his jaw clenched.

""That's enough,"" he said, his voice low but sharp.

Chole threw herself into his arms, her shoulders shaking as she buried her face in his chest. Ethan's expression softened, his arm coming up to hold her gently, fingers stroking her back in slow, comforting circles. Melina quickly stepped in, wrapping an arm around Chole, whispering something I couldn't hear.

https://preview.redd.it/ompaczsw8wpf1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=9939a886495322a9483806e310deb58c06dc57cb

  
  


It started like any other morning. Coffee in hand, I logged into[ **Infotrench.com**](http://infotrench.com) to check how our keywords were performing on Google. Normally, the analytics dashboard gave me a clear picture—ranking positions, performance shifts, and trends that helped me decide what to do next.

But that day, something felt… off. A few keywords that usually ranked on the first page had completely disappeared. Others were jumping up and down like a rollercoaster. At first, I thought it was just a reporting delay or maybe a small glitch. But then, as I compared numbers with Google Search Console, things got stranger—the two didn’t match at all.

That’s when I realized this wasn’t just my issue. It was something bigger.

# The Twist Behind the Scenes

After digging deeper, I found the reason. Just a few days earlier, **Google had quietly removed the ability to view 100 search results on a single page.**

Now, this may not sound like a big deal if you’re just searching for your favorite recipe or product—you rarely go beyond the first page anyway. But for rank-tracking tools like [**Infotrench.com**](http://infotrench.com) (and many others in the SEO industry), this was a **game-changing earthquake.**

Here’s why:

* Before: Tools could pull **100 results with one query** by simply adding the parameter &num=100 in Google’s URL. Efficient, quick, and reliable.  
* Now: That same trick no longer works. To get 100 results, the tools need to run **10 separate searches**, flipping through pages one by one.  

The impact? Data collection became 10x more expensive, slower, and less consistent. What used to be sharp analytics now sometimes looks blurry or delayed.

# Why It Matters

For me, as a user checking [**Infotrench.com**](http://infotrench.com), this change explained the sudden “weirdness” in keyword tracking. The issue wasn’t that the site was broken. Instead, the **rules of the game had changed**—and every SEO tool was scrambling to adapt.

* **Google Search Console** started showing slightly confusing or inconsistent reports.  
* **Marketers** like us suddenly saw ranking data that looked unstable, even when our SEO strategies hadn’t changed.  

In other words: the compass we relied on lost its true north overnight.

# The Takeaway

This little adventure taught me an important lesson: when you see your keyword rankings fluctuate strangely, it’s not always your SEO that’s the problem. Sometimes, it’s the **data collection methods behind the scenes**.

Google’s small tweak—removing the 100-results view—had ripple effects across the entire SEO industry. And while tools are working hard to adapt, it’s a reminder for all of us that in search marketing, the ground can shift without warning.

So the next time you notice your rankings acting strange, take a deep breath. It might not be you—it might just be Google reshaping the game again.

1nk3rd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nk3rd1/could_icepure_wfc5300a_under_sink_water_filter/,Could ICEPURE WFC5300A Under Sink Water Filter Redefine Your Home Water Quality? Review,"I’ve had the chance to try out the ICEPURE WFC5300A Under Sink Water Filter system, and let me just say, I was genuinely impressed while also finding a couple of things worth noting. This filter is designed to last for 3 years or a whopping 22,000 gallons of water—perfect for anyone who prioritizes clean drinking water without constant maintenance. Imported with quality certifications like NSF/ANSI 42, IAPMO, RoHS, and even BPA-free construction, it’s built to provide peace of mind about what’s going into your glass. But just how well does it perform under regular use? Let me walk you through it.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the filter gives an impression of durability. Crafted using lead-free and food-grade materials, it feels reassuringly sturdy yet lightweight at just 1.63 pounds. The dimensions—3.6"" in diameter and 10.8"" in height—make it pretty compact, so it snugly fits under the sink without eating up too much space. It also features a sleek design that harmonizes with modern kitchen setups. I personally appreciated the thoughtful touches, such as easy-access slots for quick installation.

**Performance that Stands Out**

The sheer filtration capacity is one of this system’s winning points. Filtering up to 0.5 microns, the filter removes over 99.99% of heavy metals, chlorine, bad odors, and contaminants while also filtering out rust and sediments. I tested it with municipal water, and the difference was immediate—clean, crisp-tasting water every single time! It’s hinted in the specs, but in practice, you’ll notice smoother-tasting water that actually makes your coffee and tea taste better too. Cooking with cleaner water feels like a subtle luxury in everyday life.  

[Ready for ICEPURE WFC5300A? See the Amazon deal.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b08q3kxs3s/)

**Ease of Installation**

This was one of the features that made me smile. Instead of calling a plumber, I installed it myself in around 20 minutes. The detailed video tutorials ICEPURE provides are a big help, making the process seamless. It’s installed under my kitchen sink, but I realized it works equally well in spaces like bathrooms or even RVs. Versatile and straightforward—exactly what I hoped for. Imagine not having to wrestle with unclear instructions. Well, this filter eliminated that problem for me.

**Strengths**

- Exceptional filtration capacity of up to 22,000 gallons or 3 years.
- Removes chlorine, heavy metals, odor, and other contaminants effectively.
- Certified with NSF/ANSI 42 and IAPMO for trusted performance.
- Easy to install without professional assistance or additional tools.

**Negatives**

- It’s only compatible with specific models like ICEPURE WFS5300A, which could be problematic if you don’t check compatibility in advance.
- The replacement schedule, while clear, might not align with those wanting slightly longer-term filters. Three years is a lot, but you still need to keep track.

**Good Aspects**

The ICEPURE filter consistently delivers clean water like a pro. Its large filtration capacity and multiple certifications assure safety and reliability. In terms of value for money, it outshines many counterparts, especially for homes using municipal water. The robustness of the filtering system combined with simplicity in maintenance made everyday life much easier. Here are a few standout benefits:

- Easy installation without added costs.  
- Compact, space-saving design under the sink.  
- Clear improvements in taste and odor—perfect for drinking and cooking.  

**Critiques**

I wouldn’t call it a deal-breaker, but I did notice a small limitation: the filter doesn’t really work for well water systems or naturally harder water sources like some competitors do. Additionally, while installation was smooth, the compatibility with specific purifier models required a bit of a double-check. A universal fitting version would add a considerable edge. These points, while minor, might influence your decision depending on your particular needs:

- Limited compatibility.  
- Designed more for municipal water use, not ideal for well water.  

**Competing Products**

When stacked against similar water filters like the Culligan US-600A or the Brita Faucet System, the ICEPURE unit holds its own. The Culligan has flexible cartridges for various water types, but it falls short in terms of longevity—only 6-12 months per filter compared to ICEPURE’s 3 years. Meanwhile, the Brita Faucet System, while convenient, doesn’t match the ICEPURE’s capacity or level of contaminant removal. Where ICEPURE really excels is in simple installation and long-term performance, giving it a slight advantage over its competitors.

**Cost Efficiency**

The financial side of the ICEPURE water filter definitely works in its favor. Given its longevity and heavy-duty contaminant removal, this filter is a solid investment for households. Considering I won’t need to purchase replacements for three years under normal conditions, it’s definitely worth penny-pinching for a bit more upfront. Maintenance costs are negligible too, which cannot be said for some pricier systems I’ve tried in the past.

At her 70s, I always try to gently tell her not to do too much, but every time she visits it's like she has this list she has to go through (visit this city, walk all over town A to B, museums, stores, spend lots of money, visit all the shops I go to etc.). And this time she overexcerted herself and twisted her knee. She didn't tell me this, instead she started using this new-found crying/begging voice of hers to tell me how she had to wait 20min for the bus when she got back to my city after going places by herself all day.

When I came to pick her up at the busstop, as a surprise since she didn't even say hello when she arrived but left like 10min to leave me to deal with all her luggage etc, she was in a foul mood and handed me all her bags and then clung to me like some support pole as if I could carry her home. When I wasn't providing her with what she needed (I had the dog, all these bags etc) she basically started urging me to leave her alone and walk ahead, then she begged a total stranger to drive her home (the good old: I am old, I am in pain, life is so hard).

Once home, everything was suddenly fine, she was nicer and started planning her daytrip for the next day; walking, lost of walking, which did not seem like a good idea, but after mentioning that she basically told me ""it's fine now, my knee doesn't hurt anymore"".

Next day, the drama happened all over again. She left early, not by car, but again by bus. Called me up after her hairdresser's appointment so we could meet up in town, and all seemed well. I arrive downtown, try and park my bike, and she calls me up with AGAIN that wheeping voice and asks me ""I'd like you to go home and ask X-neighbour if he can pick me up"", this neighbour is an old man who lives in our street, he's very kind, but she has only spoken to him a couple of times, and now she expected me to drive back, and to tell him to pick her up with his car downtown without a reason why. I mentioned he might not be home (which is logical, he has his own life), and she basically responded with ""Then give me his phonenumber, so I can call him myself"". Well, though luck because I don't have the phonenumbers of all my neighbours, and honestly I was not feeling comfortable in handing it out to her so she could bother people to play taxi for her. When I told her I didn't have it, she hung up on me.

*Thinking back, it felt like she was trying to use me to manipulate this old man into doing what she wanted. The day after she mentioned how she ""liked"" this neighbour, which makes me think she is her way of trying to get him to ""like her"" back, but in such a wrongful way. It didn't feel right, the thing she was trying to make me do, and the thing she wanted him to do.*

What started then was a cat and mouse game of ""mom, where are you right now"" and her being frustrated that I couldn't read her mind or track her GPS through sheer will alone. When I found her, she basically started hanging on me all over again, taking tiny babysteps and pausing every 5 or so to strike up a conversation about anything: the weather, what's for dinner, I'm hungry lets eat somewhere, things that were going on in her social life etc. It was so frustrating, and making me so stressed out. Suddenly she was fine to go to one more store, where she basically budged in and demanded the staff to stop helping others and instead focus on her, the owner luckily took care of her, but she was rude, so rude. Like, throwing things across the counter and telling the staff to ""put it on my pile near the checkout"". And when we got home, finally, she sat down and was like ""ah, what a long day. When's dinner? I could use some coffee, can you make me some?"" And I still had all these things to do, taking care of the dog, and not having a single moment to sit down and breathe easy. When I made us tea and coffee, and finally sat down, she started right away with ""my things can go in the car"" and ""what's for dinner? I'm hungry actually."" And when mentioning how I just wanted a moment to drink my tea, she'd say, ""Well, I didn't say you had to do it right away!""

The only good moment were the few hours in the morning when she didn't force herself to be places. For the entire visit I didn't even feel like her daughter, I felt like I was either in the way, a hotel manager, or whatever other role she wanted me to play. I simply felt stressed, the entire weekend long till she was gone.",1,1758187928.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False
1nk3osu,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1nk3osu/is_it_wrong_that_i_became_distant_as_well_and/,Is it wrong that I became distant as well and entertained his ex?,"Hey Reddit, I just got hired at my new company (25M). I met this guy (24M) at work and we became kinda close. One time, I posted a story of the two of us hanging out in the office game room. Later, I found out he had just broken up with his ex, which explained why I was shocked when his ex suddenly stalked my IG.

That’s where the teasing at work started, and since then, we’ve been spending lunch breaks together. Eventually, we got close enough to go on a friendly “date”. At that time, I honestly didn’t feel anything beyond friendship, plus things were moving really fast, especially since he had just broken up with his ex.

FF: I had to go home to my province for a family event, and while I was away, I saw in our group chat that he went on a lunch date with someone else (not sure how many times but I guess many times already). I was fine with it however it got me curious at the same time, but when I got back, he suddenly became distant for no reason.

The next day, his ex added me on Facebook, started chatting me up, and wanted to be friends. Since there was nothing going on between me and this guy anyway, I thought, “Why not?” His ex even invited me for coffee (not sure when) and I said yes because I didn’t really see a problem with it.

This workmate guy actually bought us matching bags for each of our team. But since he’s been acting distant, I decided to just buy my own bag for my team and left the bag he gave me on his desk. I became distant as well. I don’t talk to him much anymore, and I don’t even have the guts to look at him. I just don’t like the feeling that I somehow did something wrong, even though I really didn’t do anything.

So… is it wrong that I became distant as well and replied to his ex and said yes to his invitation?",2,1758187907.0,gayrelationships,2,1.0,False

1nk3nvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/EctopicSupportGroup/comments/1nk3nvz/it_wasnt_constipation/,It wasn't constipation,"I had my surgery finish a few hours ago and my left tube is gone.

My positive pregnancy test happened on 9/10 with a 5 year old Mirena IUD in place. This was diagnosed because I bled after having sex. 
I did HCG labs every couple days:

~730 -> ~940 48 hours 

940 -> 1982 in 52 hours 

1982 -> 2402 in ~48 hours in the ER

The OB thought I was perhaps very early, that I needed to prepare for a possible miscarriage, and couldn't spot anything in my uterus or tubes. In total, I had 3 transvaginal ultrasounds done.

During this entire experience, I was having constipation. Around 1pm 9/17 I felt the worst ""constipation"" yet. I was on the toilet for an hour. A couple people told me constipation was part of early pregnancy and going cold turkey on coffee could cause painful constipation that needed OTC meds. The feeling wasn't stool though, but internal bleeding pressuring my behind which caused a sharp, cramping pain. It hurt to shift my weight and walk.

1 hour later of being in the bathroom and hoping that water and meds would help pass a stool, I also wasnt pushing it either I felt like something was not right in the back of my mind, I vaginally bled and went to the ER. My left side was extra tender, not necessary my womb area but just right of my left hip bone. My whole womb and behind really hurt though, and felt full like I was gassy or backed up. 

Thankfully, it was caught somewhat early for a surgical scenario! I didn't have a lot of bleeding, my blood count looked good before surgery, my vitals were good during surgery, and I'm home now hoping for a smooth recovery. 

This doesn't even fully feel real yet for me. I hope every one of you can recover from what happened to you, and appreciate your stories!! 

Extra side note... an OB called in for a second opinion on my ER ultrasound didn't know all my history, but made a guess I had a Mirena and said she wasn't surprised. The ultrasound technician also said quietly during small talk that he isn't a fan of IUDs... so yeah, while I feel guilt that this was my fault, I am also sad that I trusted a doctor to place it in me without being fully informed.

""Thirty million, just like you wanted.""Ethan crossed the room with measured steps. The team parted for him like water around a stone. When he reached me, he took my hand in his, and for a moment, I thought he might kiss me—a rare public display of affection.Instead, he pulled a black marker from his pocket.""I promised you something special,"" he said, uncapping the marker. ""Hold out your wrist.""Confusion rippled through me, but I extended my arm. The room had gone completely silent. Ethan bent over my wrist and began to draw on my skin. The marker's chemical smell filled my nostrils as he concentrated, tongue between his teeth like a child coloring.When he finished, he stepped back with a flourish. ""There. Your very own watch.""I stared down at my wrist. A crude cartoon watch drawn in permanent marker stared back at me—wobbly numbers, stick hands pointing to what I assumed was three o'clock, and a childish strap.Someone coughed. The silence stretched painfully.""It's... creative,"" I managed, forcing a smile that felt like cracking glass.Ethan beamed, apparently oblivious to my humiliation. ""I thought you'd appreciate something personal rather than just another boring luxury watch. Anyone can buy those.""A smattering of awkward applause broke out. I maintained my smile, even as something cold settled in my chest.""Well,"" Ethan clapped his hands together, ""don't let me interrupt. Back to work, everyone. That thirty million won't multiply itself.""He left without kissing me, without a proper congratulations. The door closed behind him with a soft click that somehow felt louder than a slam.The celebration resumed, but with diminished energy. I excused myself shortly after, retreating to my office where I scrubbed at the marker until my skin was raw. It barely faded.That night, I soaked in the bathtub, trying to wash away both the marker and the lingering embarrassment. Ethan was working late—again. The house felt emptier than usual.Wrapped in my robe, I scrolled through Instagram mindlessly, seeking distraction. A new story appeared from Amber Sullivan, Ethan's assistant. I rarely checked her posts, but something compelled me to tap on her profile picture.The image loaded, and my world stopped.There, gleaming against Amber's delicate wrist, was a Patek Philippe watch. The limited-edition model Ethan had once pointed out in a magazine. ""Only fifty made,"" he'd said. ""The ultimate status symbol.""Her caption read simply: ""Thanks, boss! #blessed #dreamscometrue""My thumb trembled as I checked the timestamp. Posted today—the same day Ethan had drawn a childish doodle on my wrist.I zoomed in on the watch. One hundred thousand dollars of precision engineering and luxury, nestled against Amber's skin. The skin on my own wrist still bore faint black marks from Ethan's marker.Something crystallized inside me—hard, sharp, and irreversible.

Chapter 2I didn't sleep that night. The image of Amber's wrist adorned with that Patek Philippe burned behind my eyelids whenever I closed them. The contrast was too stark, too deliberate—a hundred-thousand-dollar watch for his assistant, a marker drawing for his wife who'd just secured thirty million dollars for his company.I waited until morning. The weak autumn sunlight filtered through our bedroom curtains as Ethan emerged from the shower, toweling his hair dry. Our Upper East Side apartment felt suddenly claustrophobic, the tasteful furnishings I'd selected over the years now witnesses to my humiliation.""Did you sleep well?"" he asked casually, not really looking at me as he selected a tie from his extensive collection.I unlocked my phone and held it up, Amber's Instagram post displayed prominently. ""I think we need to talk about this.""Ethan glanced at the screen, his expression flickering for just a moment before settling into practiced neutrality. ""About Amber's new watch? What about it?""""You bought her a hundred-thousand-dollar Patek Philippe."" My voice remained steady, though I could feel heat rising to my face. ""The same day you drew a cartoon on my wrist with marker.""He sighed, the sound so condescending it made my teeth clench. ""It's a business incentive, Victoria. Amber's been instrumental in several key projects.""""And I just closed a thirty-million-dollar deal.""""That's different."" He turned away, selecting cufflinks from a leather case. ""You're my wife, not an employee I need to motivate.""""So your wife deserves less recognition than your assistant?""Ethan's shoulders stiffened. He turned, his face arranged into an expression of patient disappointment that I'd seen countless times before. ""Why are you being so materialistic? I thought you'd appreciate something personal and meaningful. If I'd known you wanted some overpriced timepiece, I would have just had accounting cut you a bonus check.""The casual cruelty of his words struck me like a physical blow. ""This isn't about the watch itself. It's about what it represents.""""What it represents,"" he mimicked, rolling his eyes. ""You sound ridiculous right now. I'm late for a meeting.""As he moved toward the door, something snapped inside me. I stepped into his path. ""No. We're finishing this conversation.""Surprise flashed across his face. I rarely challenged him directly.""You've been gaslighting me for years,"" I said, the realization crystallizing as I spoke. ""Making me feel ungrateful, materialistic, or emotional whenever I ask for basic recognition.""""You're being hysterical,"" he said, but there was uncertainty in his voice now.""Am I? Let's find out.""I grabbed my laptop from the nightstand and opened it, quickly navigating to FosterTech's internal expense portal. My senior position gave me access to financial records most employees couldn't see. Ethan moved to stop me, but froze when he saw what was already on my screen.""Le Bernardin, $1,200. Per Se, $1,800. Weekend at Gurney's in the Hamptons, $5,400."" I scrolled through the records, my voice growing colder with each entry. ""All expenses filed under 'Amber Sullivan, performance bonus.' Quite the performer, isn't she?""Ethan's face hardened. ""You're violating company privacy protocols.""""That's what concerns you? Not the fact that you've been lavishing your assistant with luxury while telling me we needed to be careful with expenses?"" I continued scrolling, each new entry fueling the ice forming around my heart. ""Tiffany & Co., $12,000. Cartier, $8,500. All while you claimed we couldn't afford to renovate the kitchen because 'cash flow was tight.'""""Business expenses are different from personal ones,"" he said, but his argument sounded hollow even to him.""And this?"" I clicked on an entry from three months ago—a weekend at the Plaza Hotel, presidential suite. ""Was this business too?""The color drained from his face. ""You're misinterpreting—""""I'm not stupid, Ethan."" My voice was barely above a whisper now. ""I just trusted you. My mistake.""I closed the laptop and looked at him—really looked at him—perhaps for the first time in years. The handsome face that had once made my heart race now seemed like a mask, hiding something ugly and small.""I'll be staying at the Carlyle tonight,"" I said, moving past him to the closet. ""And I'll be calling Eleanor Vance in the morning.""""The divorce attorney?"" His voice cracked. ""Victoria, you're overreacting. We can talk about this.""I turned to him, the marker stain still faintly visible on my wrist. ""I think we're done talking.""

Chapter 3Eleanor Vance's office exuded the quiet confidence of old money—understated elegance that whispered rather than shouted. Much like the woman herself. She studied the prenuptial agreement through tortoiseshell reading glasses, her silver-streaked hair pulled into an immaculate bun. I sat across from her, fingers drumming nervously against the leather armchair.""Interesting,"" she murmured, turning to the final page.""What's interesting?"" I leaned forward, the memory of Ethan's cartoon watch still burning on my wrist despite my attempts to scrub it away.Eleanor removed her glasses, fixing me with a penetrating gaze. ""Did you ever actually read this document before signing it, Mrs. Foster?""Heat rushed to my cheeks. ""I... skimmed it. We were three weeks from the wedding. Ethan said it was standard protection for his startup.""""Standard, indeed."" A smile played at the corner of her mouth. ""Except for this clause here."" She turned the document toward me, pointing to section 8.3.I squinted at the legal jargon, struggling to decipher its meaning.""In layman's terms,"" Eleanor explained, ""this clause stipulates that in the event of infidelity, the injured party is entitled to fifty percent of all assets acquired during the marriage, plus an additional twenty percent of pre-marital assets.""My breath caught. ""That's... unusually generous.""""Extraordinarily so. These clauses typically favor the wealthier spouse—which at the time of signing was Mr. Foster, correct?""I nodded slowly. ""His startup had just secured first-round funding.""""Yet he signed a document that would devastate him financially if he cheated."" Eleanor tapped her manicured nail against the paper. ""Either he never intended to be unfaithful, or...""""Or he never thought I'd find out,"" I finished, a cold clarity washing over me. ""Or never thought I'd leave.""Eleanor leaned back, studying me. ""You have evidence of the affair?""I pulled out my phone, opening a folder of screenshots—Amber's Instagram posts, expense reports, hotel reservations. ""Plenty.""She reviewed them with clinical detachment. ""Good. Very good. With this clause and this evidence, we're in an exceptionally strong position.""For the first time since discovering Amber's watch, I felt a glimmer of satisfaction. ""What's our next step?""""I'll draft the divorce petition today. In the meantime—"" she fixed me with a stern look, ""—secure your finances. Immediately.""I left Eleanor's office with a strange lightness in my step. The prenup that Ethan had pressured me to sign—the document I'd resented for years as a symbol of his distrust—might be my [salvation.My](http://salvation.My) phone buzzed as I stepped onto the sidewalk. A company-wide email from Ethan:\*Due to unexpected budget constraints, all non-executive salaries in the Carter Project Division will be reduced by 30%, effective immediately.\*My stomach dropped. The Carter Project Division—my team. The people who had just secured the company's largest deal ever.This wasn't about budgets. This was punishment.I called Liam immediately. ""Have you seen the email?""""Just opened it."" His voice was tight with controlled anger. ""Everyone's freaking out. Sarah's in tears.""""I'm so sorry, Liam. This is because of me.""""Because of you? Victoria, we all know what's happening. The timing isn't exactly subtle.""I closed my eyes, leaning against the cool stone of the building behind me. ""I'm meeting with lawyers. Filing for divorce.""A beat of silence. ""Good.""The simple approval in his voice nearly broke me.""What can I do for my team?"" I asked.""Nothing right now."" Liam's voice dropped lower. ""But just so you know—we're with you. All of us. Whatever happens.""""He's cutting your salaries by thirty percent, Liam. You have families, mortgages—""""And we have loyalty."" His voice was firm. ""You built this team. You fight for us every day. We know who deserves our allegiance.""Tears pricked at my eyes. ""Thank you.""As I hung up, another email notification appeared—this one from Amber Sullivan to the entire company:\*Please join us in congratulating Amber Sullivan on her promotion to Executive Assistant to the CEO with expanded responsibilities in client relations.\*Attached was a photo of her wrist, the Patek Philippe gleaming against her skin.The message couldn't be clearer. Ethan was declaring war—not just on me, but on everyone loyal to me.What he didn't realize was that I'd spent seven years learning from the best. If he wanted war, I would give him one he'd never forget.

A single ember moving through the crowd, her steps measured, head slightly lowered. People brushed past her, indifferent, the rhythm of the city swallowing her whole.

As she walked, the streets subtly changed. The boutique windows gave way to shuttered storefronts. Bright awnings disappeared, replaced with graffiti-scrawled brick and peeling paint. The sidewalks seemed narrower here, the air heavier, carrying the sour smell of old grease and damp concrete.

Still she walked, the yellow spot in a landscape that seemed to drain itself of color the deeper she went.

At last, she stopped. The address had led her here: a squat metal shutter wedged between two abandoned storefronts. No name. No signage. Nothing but a magnetic card reader bolted crookedly into the wall.

Elisabeth hesitated, glancing over her shoulder as though expecting someone to laugh, to stop her, to say she didn't belong here. But the street was indifferent.

She slid the white card across the reader. A mechanical groan. The shutter creaked upward and jammed halfway.

She tried again. Nothing. The shutter hung there like a mouth frozen mid-sentence.

Her throat tightened. She crouched low, brushed grit off her knees, and ducked under into shadow.

Inside, the air smelled of dust and chemicals. A flyer for pest control was tacked to the wall, the cartoon rat smiling obscenely. She moved down the long and narrow corridor, the flickering light buzzing overhead.

At the end, the space widened into a lobby no larger than a storage closet. Harsh neon bled across windowless walls, exposing every stain and every crack.

On one side, a grid of metal boxes. Dozens of them, stacked like forgotten coffins. Elisabeth scanned the numbers, her eyes stopping first on 207, low to the ground. And then, higher up, a box marked **503.**

Her hand trembled slightly as she held up the white card.

Then followed a beep and the lock disengaged.

The cardboard box sat on her coffee table like an accusation. Brown and ordinary. Yet the numbers scrawled in black marker — **503** — pulsed in her mind as though they carried a secret code.

The apartment was immaculate again, Maria's touch restoring it to showroom perfection. Not a pillow out of place. Not a glass left unpolished. And still, in the middle of all that tidiness, the box waited for her.

Elisabeth sat on the couch, elbows on her knees, staring at it. She felt as if she were waiting for the box to open itself, to relieve her of the responsibility. But it did not.

At last, with a sharp breath, she tore at the tape.

Inside, the contents were arranged with unnerving precision, each object cradled in white foam. She lifted them out one by one and placed them carefully on the table, the ritual strangely reverent.

A vial no bigger than her thumb, glowing faintly under the lamp's light. On its label: **ACTIVATOR** — single use, discard after use. Her skin prickled. The word itself felt final.

Next: a clear plastic kit, sterile, clinical. Inside, long silver needles and plastic barrels, labeled **STABILIZER** — other self.

Her hand hovered over the next item. It looked like a sewing kit, yet nothing domestic or comforting about it. Steel scissors, gauze pads, surgical thread, disinfectant. Tools of repair… or violation.

A transparent tube coiled like a sleeping serpent bore a tag: **SWITCH.**

Finally, she drew out two heavy pouches filled with thick yellow liquid. They sloshed wetly when she shifted them. The words stenciled in black across the surface made her stomach lurch: **FOOD — MATRIX — OTHER SELF.**

On the plastic, numbers were lined in descending order, each paired, each mirrored: 7 — 76 — 65 — 54 — 43 — 32 — 21 — 1 Switch. Switch.

The symmetry was terrifying and absolute.

At the very bottom of the box lay a card no bigger than a business note. On one side, the instructions were reduced to iconography and brutal simplicity: **YOU ACTIVATE** — only once (intravenous) **YOU STABILIZE** — every day (intramuscular) **YOU SWITCH** — every seven days, without exception

Her fingers turned it over, the cardboard soft against her skin. One final line waited for her there, in stark black letters:

**REMEMBER YOU ARE ONE.**

Elisabeth's gaze swept over the table. The yellow vial caught the light like a drop of sunlight. The needles gleamed. The bags of thick liquid loomed, grotesquely alive.

She sat very still, heart thudding, as though afraid her movement alone might activate it all.

The air in the room seemed to tilt around her. For the first time, she felt that she was not sitting alone.

\---

Later on, she stood naked before the mirror. Her reflection stared back, stripped of costume and mask. The bright bulbs traced every contour of her body: the curve of her breasts, the soft line of her belly, the beauty mark pressed like a fingerprint next to her navel. She slid her hand across it as though confirming that yes, it was still there — the one immutable detail in a body that otherwise felt like it was betraying her.

She was still beautiful. Everyone said so. But the glass didn't lie: the faint slackening of skin, the shadows under her eyes, the small betrayals that whispered *time is winning*. Each trace of age felt amplified, magnified into catastrophe. The end of youth, the end of desire, the end of everything.

And in the silence of the bathroom, she heard it again, the voice. Deep and resonant.

*You are the matrix.*

She froze. The words seemed to vibrate in her bones.

On the silver tray beside the sink, the instruments gleamed in clinical alignment. The vial pulsed faintly yellow, promising something more.

*Everything comes from you. And everything is you.*

Her hand trembled as she picked up the syringe, slid the needle into the vial, and drew the fluorescent liquid. She held it to the light: it glowed like captured lightning.

*This is simply… a better version of yourself.*

Her reflection studied her with accusation, as if daring her to go through with it.

She wrapped the tourniquet around her arm, bit down hard to tighten it. The alcohol stung her skin as she dabbed, searching for a vein. The metal tip hovered and poised.

One deep breath. And then the plunge. The needle slipped beneath her flesh as the yellow fire slid into her vein.

She waited with her muscles taut as her lungs locked.

Nothing.

A long exhale, part relief, part disappointment. Her lips twisted into a bitter smile. ""This is bullshit—""

The world lurched. The tiles spun. She fell forward, skull cracking against porcelain white.

Then the pain came.

It was as if her stomach had been set ablaze from within. A violent spasm curled her body into a knot, forcing a strangled cry from her throat. Sweat poured from her pores, drenching her skin in fever heat.

And then — movement.

Something was alive under her flesh. Not cramps, not spasms, something *growing.* It slid beneath her skin, bulging, distorting, as if a thousand insects were crawling through her veins.

Her scream dissolved into gasps. Her hearing warped, the bathroom muffling around her, as though her head had been dunked underwater. Her own heartbeat thundered in her ears.

Her vision tunneled. Extreme focus. Her pupil dilated into darkness — then split. A fissure opened inside the iris itself, dividing into two. She blinked, but the second eye flickered in her vision, obscene, impossible and gone again.

Her back arched violently. Waves rolled beneath her skin, each ripple cracking the surface of her spine. The flesh split. Wetly. Slowly. As if unzipping itself.

From within, something pushed. Pressed like it was emerging.

Bone. A spine — *another* spine — rising, threading its way up from beneath her own.

Her body was no longer hers. It was a container, splitting at the seams.

The scream caught in her throat as the sound was swallowed by a deafening ringing. A black hole widened inside her pupil, pulling everything into its vortex.

She felt herself fall, spiraling into the abyss. A tunnel of blinding fluorescent light swallowed her whole, rushing toward a singular white point that devoured everything—

Then nothing.",1,1758186986.0,demonhatstories,0,1.0,False

We’ve been out for coffee and stuff and he’s very straight, which is where my crush ends. 

I always thought we had enough in common to least stay friends, because hey, making friends in your 30s isn’t easy (he’s mid 20s, btw). 

Today at the gym, he randomly asked me about political views and it took me aback so I gave a normal “I’m pretty liberal” answer. I never felt more judged after that. He went on a little rant about women and the LGBT community and how they have all the rights in the world but still aren’t happy. I politely disagreed but what hurt more was someone I thought I knew saying some pretty mean things. He’s been pretty intelligent, bookish, and self aware otherwise. 

So I left. Even though he texted me saying “you left early?” And gave him some excuse about being late for a thing. I don’t know bros, do I keep up this friendship, because the crush is pretty much dead. 

TL;DR: Guy I like at the gym had opinions about women and the gay community. Not sure if I should maintain this friendship. ",1,1758186853.0,askgaybros,12,0.57,False

I was struggling every day for the past 2 years, still mildly, but for the past 4 months i’ve had no tics during the day and just some at night sometimes. I feel same but different, it’s a different mental attitude. going from, ‘I need to make this movement omggg’ to actually no I don’t need to’. the urge I felt has been less jumping out of me, but more a minor sensation suggesting to me, and my sound mind saying, no, I don’t need to do that. 
it’s only when I have gotten very tired and stressed, stopped taking care of myself, or have taken drugs/alcohol/drinking coffee the tics come back a bit bc my strength in myself/inhibition goes. 

like taking care of yourself you’re sweet but if you fall it’s so hard to stop again. i feel like I’m slowly figuring something out in my mind and putting it into practice. lately ive been feeling ticcy, and getting the panicky feeling of suppressing and not being able to stop, I smoked some weed and felt an attack starting, I was with my boyfriend, and really started telling myself you’re okay, you don’t need to do this, you’re okay, and after a little while it worked. 
also i’ve been darting my eyes around constantly when people aren’t looking, thinking omg I just want to go somewhere and let it out, but then, whenever I focus or get into something like an activity or conversation it goes away and I feel better, get by myself and boom I’m cool I don’t need to explode anymore. 

does anyone else with it mild have it come up in certain situations/mindsets and kinda make you think about wtf is going on?? 

for what it’s worth, i had a breakthrough that started my being mostly free from this recently. I know most of you separate yourself from it anyway but it’s really not a part of me. me is the one who is free. if it’s something I have to question or learn from that’s not authentically me. it’s something placed onto me. I’m fully removed. at my best I don’t feel the need to engage. but yes sometimes the restless voice and feeling tries to invite itself back in. it’s an indulgence. I see it as a separate entity now. a negative one imposing itself onto me, sorry, it hurt thinking about it like that when it was still so connected to me, so I feel bad saying it, but it’s how I see it now. with spiritual strength in myself I have protective layers to shield myself from the ticcy entity. essentially. past couple days i’ve been struggling though, after a lit birthday weekend, so I’m thinking about this again. it’s hard to make it stop when it’s already started. you know what I mean 

does anyone else think about this in a more spiritual way?? rather than wtf doctors say? im also against mental health diagnoses I think they keep you attached to certain beliefs about yourself. I don’t like imposing my views on people bc I know many find help and peace in putting a label on yourself. I know I think very differently to most people if you think like me you get what I’m saying 

also sorry but not sorry that this is all over the place :P
one other thing, I’m really mild and I think people on the fringes can really look at the parameters of severity and the complexity without being fully immersed. I think I’m here for a reason. and I really feel for those who have it bad. when I get a bad flare up, can be just for a few days, and my neck hurts so bad, I feel so defeated.

dinner:

small tuna salad(half onion, cucumber, tomato and 1 can of salt water tuna) , 2 boiled eggs and 2 spoons of tahini.

I’m really struggling with my fiancé right now and could use some outside perspective.

This morning he asked me to make him a coffee, and I said “yeah, in a minute, I’m waiting for a phone call.” He immediately got upset and said, “fine I’ll do it myself then, you know for someone who wants to be a housewife you don’t do the stuff you need to do.”

For context, I already vacuum every day, wash up, and handle most of the general cleaning. But this isn’t even our place it’s his parents’ house so I sometimes feel like I’m crossing boundaries if I do too much. Still, he tells me I “don’t clean up properly.”

He also says he gets annoyed that when he comes back from the gym I don’t automatically offer him food, because “that’s what a housewife would do.” The thing is, I’m not his wife yet, and we don’t even have our own home. I told him I’d be happy to step into that role when we’re married and have our own place, but right now I want us to have goals to work towards, like moving out together and building a stable future.

When I brought this up, he called me “rude and disrespectful” for even having expectations of my own. He said I was basically showing “the type of person I am” by not wanting to act like a housewife until we’re actually married. He also told me, “the relationship will go how I want it to because I’m the man.” That really stung, because it feels like he doesn’t care about my needs or voice at all.

He’s had a big loss in his family a few months ago, and I was there for him through all of it. I know he’s been grieving and it’s taken a toll, and I want to support him. But he’s also said he doesn’t want to leave his parents’ house, and although he talks about starting a business, so far that’s just been making business cards and posting on Facebook. He does cover some costs here and there, but I told him he needs a stable income if he wants us to build the traditional dynamic he says he wants.

Today, after this argument, he slammed the bedroom door and stormed off. He’s so angry at me, and I honestly don’t understand what I’ve done that’s so wrong. I want our relationship to succeed, but I also don’t want to lose myself or my future in the process.

I love him, but I feel like I’m walking on eggshells and that my wants don’t matter. Is this just a rough patch because of stress and grief, or are these serious red flags about how he sees me and our relationship?",5,1758186464.0,relationship_advice,109,0.61,False

Ever wondered if the coffee shop, your landlord, or even your parents can see what you’re doing on their WiFi? Short answer: YES!

# What can WiFi owners actually see?

Depending on the router and their tech skills, WiFi owners might be able to see:

* What devices are connected (with names)
* When you connected/disconnected
* What sites you visited (sometimes full URLs)
* How long you stayed on each site
* Even stuff you downloaded or streamed

And this isn’t just a myth. Lots of routers log this by default, and some offices or families run extra tracking software.

# Scenarios where your activity might be visible

* Parents using parental control systems
* Employers running monitoring software
* Tech-savvy WiFi owners checking router logs

And incognito mode won’t protect you. It only hides history on your device, not from the WiFi owner.

# How to STOP your browsing sistory from being tracked?

The easiest way is by using a VPN. A VPN encrypts your traffic (AES-256 level) so that anyone looking at the router logs only sees gibberish instead of your browsing history.

1. Use a VPN: This encrypts your traffic so the WiFi owner can only see you’re “online” but not where you go or what you do.
2. Be careful what you share: Think before you log in on shared networks.
3. Use strong passwords and unique emails: General good practice.

While I absolutely love the stunningly beautiful design of the collecter-centric decks that Bicycle, Theory11 and Kings Wild Project make, I've fallen rather in love with the cheapo merchanidising ones, finding myself sitting up with equal zeal over a childhood cartoon deck as I would at looking at the ornate, intricate designs painstakingly put together by a talented artist for a limited edition theme.

It's as if the decks, while in my hands or splayed out on a table, are an extension of me - whether that's my mood, or an aspect of myself I'd long lost touch with.

I think this can be said about any hobby or collection... they're an expression of our inner worlds brought out into the cold hard light of day.

- keep it but turn off alerts and battery nags
- or switch to Apple's simple Find My without all the notifications

He says I'm overreacting, that it helps his anxiety and ""if there's nothing to hide, what's the issue?"" What bugs me more is that he often mutes his own alerts and sometimes forgets his phone at the gym, but expects me to be on it 24/7. That double standard is... weird. I love him and he's otherwise a great partner, but this is definitely making me feel trapped.

AIO for wanting to delete the app altogether if he won't turn off the alerts? Is this normal in healthy relationships or am I being too sensitive? Scripts for resetting this boundary would be super helpful. Would couples therapy be overkill here?",6,1758185665.0,AmIOverreacting,19,0.88,False

Morning: 1 scoop Amul Unflavoured Raw Whey + 2 sachets of Nescafe Rs.2 coffee, mixed with milk

Evening: 1 scoop The Whole Truth Cold Coffee flavour, also with milk (After workout)

I prefer using milk because I don’t like the taste with water—plus, the extra milk adds a bit more protein.

1. the “morning system” at 7am, my devices wake before i do. shortcut fires → iphone fetches weather, compiles my top 3 tasks from reminders, opens daily journal in obsidian, starts a focus playlist, sets watch into work focus. i drink coffee → day is already staged. this isn’t a trick, it’s chaining built-ins into ritual

2. the contract pipeline pdf lands in mail → hazel (mac) auto-renames + files it → ipad opens in files → sign with pencil → airdrop back → mail sends. no adobe, no 3rd-party subscription. a full workflow that takes 40 seconds flat

3. the environment triggers nfc tag on desk = iphone sets focus, mac launches xcode + safari + notes, watch mutes, lights shift via homekit. bedtime tag = ipad opens books, watch starts sleep, phone goes into night shift. spaces trigger flows

4. the project workflow system drop new file in downloads → auto-renamed, filed to client folder, task created in things, slack team notified. the “admin” vanishes. feels like you hired a digital assistant

5. the travel automation carplay connection = iphone launches maps, queues podcast, sends eta text, enables low power, watch logs departure. zero taps while rushing out the door

the magic isn’t in shortcuts alone it’s in combining them with focus modes, hazel, keyboard maestro, homekit, nfc, even watch automations. once you stop chasing “features” and start building systems, the ecosystem feels like one machine instead of 4 devices.

The Definitive 2025 Guide for Bahrain Company Formation, Regulations, and Practical Success\
\
Alt text: Professional business people in discussion at Bahrain Financial Harbour., and the latest Reuters economic reports, Bahrain’s projected GDP growth is 3.8% for 2025, driven by fintech, logistics, and manufacturing.\
\
Over 54% of Bahrain’s private sector workforce is expatriate (Gulf News, May 2025)\
Bahrain ranked #1 in the MEA region for cost-effectiveness of company formation\
New regulatory changes now allow 100% foreign ownership in most sectors (effective January 2025).\
\
Firsthand, I’ve noticed a surge in new tech startups at Bahrain Bay and Seef, with founders from the UK, India, and Saudi Arabia. Their teams communicate in English, switch to Arabic with government officials, and sometimes chat in Hindi over coffee. It’s a unique blend.\
Official government regulations – Bahrain.com\
\
Why Language Matters for Bahrain Company Formation\
English: The Business Backbone\
\
All major business documents, contracts, and proposals can be drafted in English.\
MOICT (Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism) accepts English versions of most commercial registration documents.\
Multinational corporations and SMEs default to English for internal and external communications.\
\
Arabic: Regulatory and Legal Groundwork\
\
Commercial Registration (CR) and all Sijilat applications require Arabic legal names.\
Government portals (LMRA, Sijilat, Tamkeen) offer bilingual functionality, but some regulatory notices and tax documents are issued in Arabic only.\
Business stamps, signage, and official company documents often must feature Arabic alongside English.\
\
Personal aside: When I submitted my CR at the MOICT in the Diplomatic Area, I was relieved to find bilingual officers on hand—though my Arabic helped speed things up with document verification.\
Other Languages: The Hidden Engine\
\
Hindi, Urdu, and Malayalam are indispensable in retail, hospitality, and construction—reflecting the South Asian backbone of Bahrain’s workforce.\
Business meetings may switch between English and Hindi, depending on the team; this is especially common in the Seef mall area and Manama souk.\
\
\
Step-by-Step Guide: Navigating Language in Bahrain Company Formation\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.\
1. Choose Your Business Structure\
Start by deciding whether you’ll set up as a WLL (LLC), S.P.C, Branch, Partnership, or in a Free Zone. Each has linguistic requirements at the documentation stage.\
\
WLL, S.P.C., and Branches: Must register a legal Arabic name; English trade names are optional.\
Free Zones: Bilingual registration encouraged; allows greater flexibility during foreign filings.\
\
2. Prepare Bilingual Documentation\
\
CR Application: Fill out Sijilat online portal (Arabic legal name required, English translation optional).\
Memorandum & Articles: Submit in English, but notarized Arabic translation often needed for legal recognition.\
Tip: Use an accredited translation office—costs 30-45 BHD per document.\
\
3. Government and Banking\
\
MOICT (Diplomatic Area): Forms are bilingual, but queues are shorter if you schedule appointments after 2pm (local tip: Fridays are closed).\
Banking: Most major banks provide bilingual account managers. Emirates NBD’s Bahrain Bay branch offers same-day account opening if documents are pre-translated (saved me a week of follow-ups last year).\
Sijilat & LMRA Portals: Both accept applications in English, but official decisions come in Arabic.\
\
4. Contracts and Internal Requirements\
\
Employee contracts: English is accepted, but Arabic versions may be requested upon inspection.\
Trade documents: Most customs and logistics paperwork default to English, but keep Arabic translations on hand for LMRA visits.\
\
\
Insider Tips: Saving Time and Money\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation..\
- Networking: Attend majlis-style business gatherings in Seef or the Ritz Carlton lobby—these informal sessions often short-circuit red tape, especially if you’re introduced by a local sponsor.\
\
Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Language Needs\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company setup.\
\
Translation Fees:\
Arabic-English legal translation: 30–45 BHD/document\
Certified translation of contracts: 25–50 BHD each\
Registration Fees:\
Sijilat CR Application: ~50–100 BHD, depending on business type\
Notary and legal fees: 20–100 BHD\
\
Total first-year language and documentation budget: Plan for 250–500 BHD, depending on complexity.\
\
Professional Tip: Bundle translation and registration services—local agencies in Seef often give bulk discounts and ensure correct phrasing for MOICT and EDB filings.\
\
See current cost breakdown and budgeting advice\
\
Regulatory Compliance and Post-Formation Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for Bahrain companies.:** All annual returns and VAT filings must now include an Arabic summary, even if the main accounts are in English.\
\
Accounting and Bookkeeping:\
Bilingual financial records becoming standard; fines for non-compliance can exceed 500 BHD.\
Outsource compliance and accounting support to avoid translation errors.\
\
Personal aside: Early in my career, I missed a submission deadline because my receipts weren’t bilingual; I now recommend regular digitization and translation as you go.\
\
Common mistake: Submitting only English documents for regulatory inspections. Always keep an Arabic copy ready for LMRA audits.\
\
\
Ownership, Free Zones, and Sponsorship Nuances\
Foreign Ownership, Local Sponsorship, Free Zones Explained\

Alt text: Professional business support and consultation in Bahrain Bay.. Bahrain outpaces the UAE and KSA for openness—no “local sponsor” required except in a handful of restricted industries.\
\
Explore foreigner-friendly company activities\
Learn how 99%+ foreign ownership works\
Free zones in Bahrain offer even greater flexibility; English is the primary working language in these environments.\
\
However, in my experience, securing a Bahraini partner can still be helpful for government relations and market access even if not strictly required by law. It’s a relationship-driven business culture—majlis introductions and Ramadan networking events still open doors.\
Cultural Insight: The tradition of Arabic coffee and courtesy before meetings—never rush straight to business, even if the conversation is in English.\
How local sponsorship works\
\
Navigating the Company Formation Process: Time-Saving Steps\
Process Walkthrough (with Language Considerations):\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation..\
- Step 2: Prepare required documents (CR application, MOICT forms, shareholder IDs, office lease).\
- Step 3: Translate all official documents before submitting to Sijilat.\
- Step 4: Apply online (Sijilat/MOICT), pay fees, await review.\
  - Tip: Applications submitted Tuesdays or Wednesdays are processed fastest—avoid Mondays._\
- Step 5: Receive CR, open corporate bank account (bilingual documents required).\
- Step 6: Register with LMRA (labour market), VAT, and municipality—again, have Arabic versions ready.**\

Commercial registration requirements\
\
Bahrain vs. UAE & KSA: Language and Business Edge\
A tangent, but relevant: When a client asked about opening in Dubai instead—yes, English is widely used in the UAE, but many free zones still require Arabic legalizations and a local service agent for mainland setups. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, maintains stricter Arabic requirements at all levels. Bahrain’s flexible approach to language and ownership gives it a distinct advantage for international entrepreneurs.\
\
Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\
\
Underestimating the need for certified Arabic translations: Always confirm with Sijilat which documents need notarization.\
Mismatched names between Arabic and English filings: Double-check spellings and legal names before submission.\
Ignoring local business etiquette: Don’t rush into deals—take time for majlis introductions, even if the meeting is in English.\
Not budgeting for translation updates as regulations change: Keep a modest annual reserve for new policy compliance.\
\
\
Recommended Resources\
\
Best translation office: AlMada Translation, Seef District—swift service and MOICT accreditation.\
Corporate service provider: KeyLink Bahrain: full-service company formation, document translations, and post-setup support.\
Official updates: Bahrain government portal, Gulf News Bahrain, Reuters Bahrain Business, Forbes Business.\

\
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\
Which language should I use for my company name in Bahrain?\

See more on business type structures here\
Is English enough for doing business in Bahrain?\

See accounting and compliance services\
How much does bilingual documentation add to my company formation cost?\
Budget 30–50 BHD per document for official translations, and an additional 100–200 BHD for full company setup.\
View the complete cost guide\
Are translations required for free zone companies?\
Yes. Even in free zones, Arabic translations of key documents are requested by regulatory authorities. However, operational documents and contracts within the zone are commonly in English.\
Explore Bahrain’s free zones here\
Can I handle company formation myself, or do I need a local agent?\
You can self-apply, but using a local service provider can save weeks (and headaches)—especially for translation and dealing with regulatory changes.\

Summary:\
English is the main language for business in Bahrain, but Arabic remains key for legal and regulatory dealings. For 2025, successful company formation means investing in quality bilingual documentation, using the right local resources, and embracing Bahrain’s unique blend of business efficiency and welcoming, multicultural tradition.

Hi there! 

I’m planning on booking a cardiologist appointment as soon as my insurance kicks back in but currently have a question. 

Earlier last year I had an incident where I fainted while on the toilet. I woke up on the floor and had no memory of the event, but had cut myself and busted my nose pretty badly.

A couple months later while with my father, we were discussing heart issues that run in my family. I may have been stressed by the conversation, but next my heart rate increased drastically and my heart started to hurt immensely. This pain felt like someone had reached into my chest and started squeezing until it could pop. I ended up fainting while on the ground, and woke up about 20-30 seconds later and had urinated.

Last week I had cut my thumb open fairly badly while cooking dinner. I’ve fainted before in my teens at the sight of large amounts of blood and bad injuries on myself, so I knew it was coming. The difference is this time, my heart started hurting more than it ever had previously. A complete 10/10 pain, I couldn’t move or hardly breathe while I laid on the floor, I thought my heart was going to give out on me. My girlfriend had then watched me faint, out for around 5-10 seconds, when my leg kicked out and slammed into our coffee table (no memory of this beyond my new bruise I now have).

From what I’ve heard from the cardiologist previously, (who brushed me out after a 2 minute conversation about not being old enough to worry about heart problems), it would be hard to use a holter monitor as my symptoms are so sporadic and situationally dependent. From my previous test results the EKG (possibly ECG I don’t quite remember) my heart rhythm was normal. 

So, anything I need to be worried about?

This is everything in my perfume cabinet, and yes; also other brands. Cardboard tubes are ffern, some designer brands on the bottom and Body Shop / Yves Rocher in between. But mainly; Lush in all shapes, sizes and scents. 

Although I’m pretty sure I still must have some black small spray bottles, but can’t seem to find those now, couldn’t get them in this cabinet due to the shape and size.

I’ve been a Lushie since 2006, with my Lush career starting in 2007 as packing mailorder parcels and ending in customer care in 2021.
So remember; this is 14 years of mainly staff discount hoarding combined with an absolute love of perfume. 

I’ve went on some Lush work trips as well, events in London and Florence to get to know new products/celebrate launches/ get training on them. So there are a definitely memories connected to some these :-)

1nk2uf1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nk2uf1,Did the coffee dip trick on my Krueger Dunks,"Nike SB Dunk Low Freddy Krueger S2 batch is far away from being a 1:1 replica but that is currently the best affordable batch around here. 
Color is off, stripped fabric material is off, shape is off (specially the mudguard), blood patterns are off and badly placed,... But hey, we aren't supposed to have these sneakers, right ? So who cares ? 

I own the previous budget batch and it's even worse but the stripped fabric material is better and mudguards too. The rest is budget. 
I repainted this budget batch and add the correct blood patterns. The only thing I don't like with this batch are the swooshes not being the correct shape on one side of each shoe. 

So, I bought the S2s a year ago and thought that I could fix the blood patterns. I was wrong because there is no way to erase correctly the factory ones due to the material (nubuk). I tried on a little spot with acetone but it spread the color. 
So, I left these in their box until last week when I saw u/RealShoddy tutorial. I gave it a try but didn't go as far for the burned effect.
I repainted over the blood splatters to break the edges with a more red burgundy paint. 
I'm overall satisfied with the results.

I am 27M, `5.4Ft`, `66Kg`, and of South Asian ethnicity. He has no known prior medical conditions and is not on any medication.

Despite some of these lab results looking alarming, I feel completely normal and healthy. I am not experiencing any fatigue, no weakness, no abdominal pain, or any other symptoms.

One specific lifestyle detail is that I uses a low-calorie artificial sweetener (the brand is 'I'm lite 50% less calories sugar') in his tea/coffee, three times every day. I do not consume alcohol but smoke a pack of cig, everyday.

Here are the concerning results:

**Liver Function Test (LFT)**

* **AST (SGOT):** 74.80 u/L(Normal Range: 3-50 u/L)
* **ALT (SGPT):** 225.2 u/L(Normal Range: 3-50 u/L)
* **GGT:** 151.8 u/L(Normal Range: 5-55 u/L)

**Lipid Profile**

* **Total Cholesterol:** 223.6 mg/dl(Desirable: <200)
* **Triglycerides:** 212.4 mg/dl(Desirable: <150)
* **LDL Cholesterol:** 151.6 mg/dl(Optimal: <100)

**Complete Blood Count (CBC)**

* **Platelet Count:** 124 x 10³/µl(Normal: 150-410)
* **RBC Count:** 6.77 x 10⁶/µl(Normal: 4.50-5.50)
* **MCV:** 70.4 fL(Normal: 83.0-101.0)
* **MCH:** 22.4 pg(Normal: 27.0-32.0)

**My main questions are:**

1. What could be the potential connection between the very high liver enzymes and the other abnormal results?
2. How concerned should I be, given that he has absolutely no symptoms?
3. What are the typical next steps life style changes? I should prefer, since I have WFH, i hardly get change to go out.

I have had intense cravings for sweet and salty foods even when I’m properly hydrated and replacing electrolytes. 

I’ve lost 34lbs so far within the last year and a half and have managed to keep it off. I’m 20lbs away from my goal weight so I still have ways to go. I don’t really go to the gym. I achieved the weight loss by staying within my calorie deficit and walking 30-40mins 3-4x/week. 

However, I’m really having a lot of trouble getting these cravings under control and wondering if anyone has ever gone through this, and why now so suddenly when I’ve been doing so good the past 1.5year? If so, do you have any tips and tricks? 

I also want to add that I usually drink coffee in the morning and that helped a lot with my cravings but lately it seems like it’s not working as well as before. ",2,1758184393.0,loseit,4,1.0,False

It’s about a black shadowy humanoid figure that is only visible in mirrors, but invisible outside of them.","
The first scene I remember is a man driving down an empty dark road at night. His car starts making weird sounds, and when he looks in the mirror he sees a black humanoid figure. He looks again, and it’s still there. He pulls over to the side of the road, steps out of the car, and looks around but sees nothing. When he starts driving again, he sees it again in his rearview mirror, still following him. Thinking he’s just tired, he stops at a gas station to clear his head. In the bathroom, he stares into the mirror, looking at the stalls behind him, thinking something is there. Suddenly, from one of the stalls, a scientist comes out and scares him. The scientist shows him some pictures and asks if he sees it too. That’s all I remember from that part.

The second scene I remember is of a kid with glasses and curly hair who comes home from school (or somewhere) and decides to take a shower. During the shower, he notices that his hair is falling out. Panicked, he quickly goes to look in the mirror and sees the black figure behind him, which then attacks him. It throws him to the ground while remaining invisible. He manages to get into the living room, where his flip phone is on the coffee table. As he grabs for it, the invisible thing slaps it out of his hand and throws him down again. While on the ground, he tries reaching for the flip phone. Just as his fingers are about to touch it, they suddenly snap backward.

1nk2rts,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiKilledMyStartUp/comments/1nk2rts/the_uae_just_opensourced_a_32b_thinker_is_silicon/,The UAE just open‑sourced a 32B 'thinker' — is Silicon Valley nervous yet?,"So the UAE quietly built a 32B reasoning model, slapped Apache‑2.0 on it, and called it K2 Think. If you’re a founder, indie hacker, or consultant who’s spent the last decade tuning prompts and arguing about hallucinations over metaphorical coffee, this ought to be deliciously inconvenient.

What happened: MBZUAI (plus G42 and friends) released K2 Think as open weights, pitched as a compact reasoning engine that punches above its parameter count on math, science, and chain‑of‑thought tasks. Benchmarks in their model card put it near the top of open‑source math leaders; they optimized for throughput on Cerebras hardware and prioritized long CoT behavior.

Why it matters: For years the AI arms race was US vs China, with everyone else watching, forking repos, and whispering about sovereignty. K2 Think is a reminder that the map is filling in: smaller nations with capital and focused research programs can now ship competitive, open models. For you, the practical takeaway is simple — more open models mean more choices and more complexity in the vendor and model‑selection problem.

What founders and hackers should do: 1) Bench it now. If your product leans on math, logic, or multi‑step reasoning, K2 might give better accuracy/latency tradeoffs than the 100B+ incumbents. 2) Evaluate infra: 32B is compact but still nontrivial. Check memory/latency on your stack; K2’s wins are most visible with good hardware or batching. 3) License check: Apache‑2.0 is generous, but don’t assume training data openness or governance guarantees. 4) Consider sovereignty and procurement: many clients suddenly find “not-US/China” appealing for procurement or PR reasons.

Caveats: Model cards can be curated. Open weights ≠ open datasets. Safety, alignment, and adversarial robustness are still the same nasty gremlins — just from a new address.

Conclusion: K2 Think is not a magic wand, but it is a useful, memeable, and strategically important addition to the open ecosystem. If you’re building anything that requires reliable reasoning, it’s time to throw K2 on your benchmark suite and see whether the little Emirati brain out‑thinks your current stack. Will it unseat the giants? Probably not overnight — but it will make the next six months interesting.

As a firstime dad to a 5-month-old boy, my partner and I have started joking that we now rate cafes not on their coffee, but on their changing facilities! 

Finding a good one feels like a huge win, and a bad one can ruin an entire outing.

It's made me wonder if there's a better way to know what we're getting into before we go somewhere new. 

I'm exploring an app idea to help with this, but I need to know what the real-world problems are first. I'd be so grateful for your honest thoughts:

When you're judging a new place, what's on your 'parent-friendly' checklist? I'm thinking beyond just 'has a changing table' – what are the small details that make a huge difference? (e.g., the type of high chair, a separate changing room vs one in the main toilet, the location of the facilities inside the building?)

What's the best 'hidden gem' feature you've ever discovered that made you think 'everywhere should have this'? (Someone in another group mentioned the wall-mounted toddler seats for containing one child while you deal with another!)

What's your absolute worst-case-scenario story? (Let's share some solidarity!)

And finally ...

Thinking about your current routine, how do you try to solve this problem now? (e.g., Is it Google Maps roulette, checking old Mumsnet threads?). Does the idea of a dedicated app for this feel like it would solve a real headache, or more of a 'nice-to-have' convenience?

This event is huge and parking is always an issue. We decided we both didn’t want to have to pay crazy car park prices so we asked her auntie to drop us off in her car which she was happy to do. Her auntie drove her car and I was in the back of the car. It’s one of those mini vans so I can’t see much in the back (I was far back). Her auntie and her decided to stop right in front. She parked there and then they swapped spots so her auntie can drive the car back. I didn’t suggest to stop there nor did I see it was actually a taxi rank. Obviously they didn’t either. The fine ended up being over $100. She has asked me to pay half the fine but I just don’t feel like this is my fault and don’t know why I need to pay the fine? She then suggest I pay a quarter. I understand it’s a pain as ended up more expensive than driving and parking there but at the same time I don’t feel at fault here. She’s been quiet since this happened. I think she’s upset I haven’t said I’ll help pay for it. I must say I’m always the one to offer to buy a coffee for her or shout her things and it’s not often reciprocated so maybe I’m being petty from our history I’m not sure.

I’ve been on steroids since, and honestly the last two months have been brutal. It feels like my whole life has been taken over. All sense of normalcy for me is out the window— all I can do is lay down or run to the bathroom. Going to work has been horrible and I get no sleep. Beyond the physical pain, mentally it’s exhausting watching my life just pass me by.

I’ve struggled with tapering prednisone and (under my GI’s instructions) keep ending up back at 40mg. I hate to be on steroids for this long, but they’re the only thing keeping me barely afloat right now. I’m staying here until I can start my first infusion of Stelara, hopefully in the next couple weeks. But I’m so tired and discouraged. I can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I know the goal is to get into remission with biologics, but the “what ifs” take over my head. What if the medication doesn’t work? Will I ever feel normal again? Will I ever be able to enjoy coffee, alcohol, and food without worrying? i am also terrified of side effects from medication. Oh and also surgery? I know that's not the case for everyone but gosh that is scary. 

I feel like I’m in constant fight-or-flight, and reading posts about people being stuck in flares for years makes me so scared. I just want to know — does it get better?

I had no time for family, friends, or even myself. I felt like a slave to my job.

One night, I hit a breaking point. I decided I had to build something of my own.

 I was one of those people who bought every shiny new AI tool. Subscriptions piled up fast. After a while, I completely lost track of what I was paying for. I saw charges for tools I didn't require since i forgot to cancel my subscription on time.

That’s when it clicked: if I was struggling with this, other solopreneurs, startup folks, and AI enthusiasts must be too.

So, I decided to solve it. I built a [subscription tracker app](https://www.subscriptiontrackerapp.com/) that:

* Tracks all recurring payments in one place
* Sends reminders before you’re charged
* Helps cancel free trials on time

And here’s the crazy part: I was able to do this almost entirely solo using these 5 platforms:

1. **Expo Go** → made building the Android app way smoother
2. **VS Code** → my coding home
3. **Bolt** → super helpful for designing the frontend
4. **Instagram** → started sharing my build journey there
5. **X (Twitter)** → connecting with other founders + learning in public

It’s still early days, but in the first 15 days after launch, I’ve managed to get 300 downloads and 4 paying users — totaling **$17 MRR**. It may sound small, but to me, it feels huge. This little app I made for myself now paid for coffee. Its just the beginning.

The game is also as old as my metal band!

All of this feels really nuts to me :D But in a good kind of way. I have been reading the coffee reports often so I know the love and struggles behind the development.

I love Exanima with all my heart, but I've been out of the loop lately - is the full release of the game finally coming? 0.9 came out a year ago and I am really excited for the full release! 

Once it comes out, I plan to move the family somewhere for the weekend and try to finally finish the game :D (im gonna savescum for sure, otherwise I wouldn't make it with my cheese brain :D)",3,1758183376.0,Exanima,1,0.81,False

I’m hoping to meet some people who are also living here – especially ladies 💕  We can connect, hang out, grab coffee, do sports, explore nearby places, or just chill and chat.    
  
Really missing that girl time and looking forward to some fun hangouts! ✨  ",4,1758183286.0,phuket,2,0.75,False
