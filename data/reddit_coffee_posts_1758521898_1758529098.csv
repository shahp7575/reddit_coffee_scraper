Despite my physical fatigue, my heart was practically singing with excitement.



""Just a few more hours,"" I whispered to myself, quickening my pace. ""Just until tonight.""



Tonight, I wouldn't have to return to that unwelcoming house I was supposed to call home. I'd already requested time off from my part-time job—something that had earned me a disgusted spit from my boss, as usual. Being the lowest-ranked omega in our pack meant I was always stuck with the dirtiest, most backbreaking work. But I didn't care about his contempt tonight.



I was going to Gabriel's place. My boyfriend. Well, after tonight, hopefully my fiancé.



Tomorrow was the Lunar Assembly. The most sacred ceremony in the entire werewolf world, where wolves from all packs would gather together to find their destined mates under the Moon Goddess's blessing. And tomorrow was also my eighteenth birthday—finally old enough to participate in the sacred ritual. More importantly, Gabriel and I would officially establish our mate bond and I could finally escape that hellish house forever.



Tomorrow was going to change everything. Gabriel had promised. I can’t wait any minutes to see him, and kiss him.



Just thinking about Gabriel made my heart race. He was wealthy, devastatingly handsome, and the brother of our most powerful Alpha though I haven’t met his brother. Sure, I was just an omega, but Gabriel had promised me that bloodlines didn't determine everything—that love was what truly mattered.



I quickened my pace toward Gabriel's residence, a beautiful stone house in the center of Whispering Valley that was far more impressive than the tiny wooden shack my family called home. I paused at the front door, smoothing down my worn dress and taking a deep breath before knocking.



Nothing.



That was strange. Gabriel had specifically said he'd be home waiting for me tonight. I tried the door handle and found it unlocked. Maybe he was inside and hadn't heard me? I called out softly, ""Gabriel? It's me, Seraphina.”



Still nothing, but sounds drifted from upstairs. Laughter. Then something else that made my blood freeze.



Moaning.



My feet moved without permission, carrying me up the stairs like I was sleepwalking through a nightmare. The sounds grew clearer with each step—breathless gasps, the rhythmic creaking of bedsprings, and a voice I knew all too well.



""Oh God, Gabriel... right there...""



Valerie. My stepsister.



The bedroom door was slightly ajar. Through the crack, I saw them—Gabriel's muscled back moving over Valerie's pale form, her golden hair fanned across his pillow like a victory banner.



""You feel so much better than I imagined,"" Gabriel panted.



Valerie's laugh was like broken glass. ""Better than that pathetic omega sister of mine, I bet. Poor little Sera probably doesn't even know what to do with a real man.""



""Don't."" Gabriel's voice was rough. ""Don't mention her when we're like this.""



""Why not?"" Valerie's fingers traced down his spine. ""After tomorrow's ceremony, she'll know exactly where she stands. An omega like her could never satisfy you.""



The words hit me like physical blows. I stumbled backward, my shoulder slamming into the wall.



""What was that?"" Valerie hissed.



Before I could move, before I could think, my wolf surged forward with a rage I'd never felt before. My foot connected with the door, sending it crashing against the wall.



""WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?""



They sprang apart like scalded cats. Gabriel nearly fell off the bed scrambling for his pants while Valerie simply sat up, making no effort to cover herself.



""Seraphina!"" Gabriel's face went white. ""I can explain—""



""Explain?"" My voice cracked like a whip. ""Explain how you're screwing my sister the night before you were supposed to propose to me?""



""It's not what you think—""



""IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK!"" Tears streamed down my face, but my voice only grew stronger. ""You lying, cheating bastard!""



Valerie stretched languidly, finally reaching for Gabriel's shirt. ""Oh, sister dear. You really thought he'd choose you?"" She tilted her head with mock sympathy. ""How adorable.""



""Valerie, don't,"" Gabriel warned, but his voice lacked conviction.



""Don't what? Tell her the truth?"" Valerie stood, pulling the shirt on with deliberate slowness. ""That Mom and Dad have known about us for months? That they practically threw me at Gabriel because they were so embarrassed by the idea of their precious Alpha family being tied to an omega reject?""



The world tilted. ""You're lying.""



""Am I?"" Valerie moved to Gabriel's dresser, running her fingers through her hair in the mirror. ""Why don't you go home and ask them yourself? I'm sure they're waiting up for you—probably with our engagement announcement ready to show you.""



""Sera, listen—"" Gabriel finally managed to get his pants on. ""This doesn't have to change anything between us. We can still be friends—""



""FRIENDS?"" I lunged toward him, but he caught my wrists.



""You need to calm down,"" he said, his grip tight enough to bruise. ""Think about your position here. Your family. You don't want to make this worse for yourself.""



I stared into his eyes—eyes that had whispered sweet promises just days ago—and saw nothing but cold calculation.



""Let go of me,"" I whispered.



""Sera—""



""LET GO OF ME!""



I wrenched free and ran.



When I burst through our front door, my foster parents Victor and Elizabeth were sitting calmly in the living room with an elegant invitation lying on the coffee table between them. Seeing my tear-stained face and disheveled appearance, they showed absolutely no surprise.



""You... you already knew?"" I asked, my voice barely a whisper.



""Seraphina, sit down."" Victor's voice was ice-cold. ""Yes, we know about Gabriel and Valerie's relationship. And we fully support it.”



Elizabeth picked up the invitation and held it out to me. ""This is their engagement announcement. Tomorrow at the Lunar Assembly, Gabriel will officially propose to Valerie. They hope you'll attend as Valerie's sister.”



I stared at the beautiful invitation in my trembling hands. Gabriel and Valerie's names were embossed in gold, along with the silver crest of the Nightshadow family. It was all real. They had all betrayed me.



Victor and Elizabeth had been so kind when they first adopted me—back when they'd struggled with infertility for years. I still remembered Elizabeth's gentle smile as she tucked me into bed, telling me I was their precious daughter. But everything changed after I'd been with them for a year. The moment Elizabeth discovered she was pregnant with her own child, I became nothing more than an unwanted burden.



""Why?"" My voice was hoarse. ""Why would you do this to me? Sister? I would never be a sister to that evil bitch!”



""Enough!"" Victor shot to his feet and backhanded me across the face with brutal force. The impact sent me crashing to the floor, my cheek burning with pain. ""You're nothing but an abandoned child we took in out of pity. What right do you have to make a scene and insult our daughter?”



""Seraphina, you should be grateful that we raised you."" Elizabeth's voice was devoid of any warmth. ""Now that you know your place, you'll accept reality. Tomorrow at the ceremony, you'll bless your sister's engagement and then find yourself a suitable omega mate to live quietly with.”



""I won't!"" I struggled to my feet, tasting blood on my lip. ""I'll never bless this goddamn betrayal!”



Victor raised his hand again, but this time I was ready. I dodged and ran for the door as Elizabeth's voice shrieked behind me: ""You ungrateful little brat! Get out of our house!”



I fled into the night, running blindly through the darkness as tears fell like broken pearls. I didn't know where I was going; I only knew I couldn't stop moving or the crushing pain would swallow me whole.



I don't know how long I ran, but eventually I found myself on Main Street when a familiar voice made me stop.



""Sera!""



I spun around to see Ophelia running toward me, her dark hair flying behind her.



""I saw you run in—what happened? You look like you've seen a ghost.""



""Worse."" I collapsed into her arms. ""I've seen the truth.""



""Tell me.""



So I did. Every horrible detail, every cruel word, every moment of my world crumbling. Ophelia held me while I shook, her own anger building with each revelation.



""Those bastards,"" she hissed when I finished. ""All of them. Gabriel, Valerie, your so-called parents.""



""What am I going to do?"" I cried against her shoulder. ""Tomorrow is the Lunar Assembly. Everyone will see Gabriel and Valerie's engagement. I'll be the laughingstock of the entire pack.”



""Listen to me, Sera."" Ophelia stroked my hair gently. ""We're not waiting for that damned ceremony. Tonight, we're going to Silver Moon Harbor!”



""What?"" I pulled back to look at her, still having tears on my face.



""I heard there's a huge party in Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Lots of wolves from other packs who are here for tomorrow's ceremony will be there."" Ophelia's eyes sparkled with excitement. ""We're going to have some fun and forget all about these bastards and your heartless family!”



""But... but I..."" I hesitated. As an omega, Silver Moon Harbor was completely foreign territory to me.



""But what?"" Ophelia gripped my hands. ""Sera, you've lost everything here. Instead of staying to be humiliated tomorrow, let's go to Silver Moon Harbor and try our luck. Maybe you'll meet your real destined mate—someone who won't give a damn about your bloodline.”



I looked into Ophelia's determined eyes, thinking about the cruel words I'd heard in Gabriel's bedroom, remembering my parents' cold faces, imagining the humiliation I'd face tomorrow…



""Okay."" I wiped away my tears, feeling a fierce courage I'd never experienced before. ""Let's go to Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Let all those people go to hell!”



Ophelia grinned with delight. ""Now that's my Seraphina! Come on, let's go back to my place and get ready. Tonight, we're going to show the most beautiful girl!""



...



Seraphina's POV



Ophelia dragged me back to her small apartment above the bakery, her eyes blazing with determination. ""We're not letting those bastards win,"" she declared, pulling out makeup and rifling through her closet. She spun around, holding up an emerald green dress that perfectly matched my eyes. ""Tonight, we show them what they lost.""



The dress was beautiful—silky and elegant, with a flowing skirt that hugged my curves in all the right places. As Ophelia worked on my makeup, carefully applying smoky eyeshadow that made my green eyes pop, I felt something shifting inside me.



""There,"" Ophelia stepped back, admiring her handiwork. ""Now you look like the goddess you are.""



I barely recognized myself in the mirror. The woman staring back at me looked confident, mysterious, beautiful. Nothing like the broken omega who'd fled Gabriel's house just hours ago.



""Come on,"" Ophelia grabbed my hand. ""Silver Moon Harbor awaits.""



The ride to the harbor district felt like stepping into another world. Where Whispering Valley was all cobblestones and quaint cottages, Silver Moon Harbor was glass and steel reaching toward the stars. The Moonlight Hotel rose before us like a glittering palace, its windows blazing with warm light.



""I can't believe we're actually doing this,"" I whispered as we approached the grand entrance.



""Believe it, honey,"" Ophelia grinned, straightening her own midnight blue dress and passed me a mask. ""Tonight, we're not omega and beta from nowhere. Tonight, we're mysterious beauties who belong wherever we damn well please.""



The ballroom took my breath away. Crystal chandeliers cast rainbow patterns across marble floors, and hundreds of werewolves in elegant attire mingled beneath soaring ceilings. Everyone wore elaborate masks, adding an air of mystery to the already intoxicating atmosphere. The scents of different packs mingled in the air—pine forests, ocean spray, mountain herbs—creating a symphony that made my newly awakened wolf stir with interest.



""Holy shit,"" I breathed, then immediately covered my mouth. ""Sorry, I just—""



""Don't apologize for anything tonight,"" Ophelia laughed, leading me toward the bar.



She pressed two tequila shots into my hands, raising her own. ""To new beginnings and leaving the past in the dust!""



The alcohol burned down my throat, but it was a good burn—cleansing, like it was washing away the bitter taste of betrayal. Ophelia immediately ordered two more.



""I don't usually drink this much,"" I protested weakly.



""You don't usually find your boyfriend screwing your sister either,"" she pointed out. ""Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures.""



By the third round, I was feeling deliciously dizzy and incredibly free. The pain was still there, but muffled now, wrapped in cotton and shoved into a corner of my mind.



""Dance with me,"" Ophelia pulled me toward the crowded dance floor, and for the first time in hours, I smiled genuinely.



We lost ourselves in the music, spinning and laughing like we didn't have a care in the world. Other wolves watched us with interest, but I was too caught up in the moment to care. This was what freedom felt like—wild and intoxicating and absolutely terrifying.



When a slow song began to play, I was about to suggest we get some air when I felt a warm hand capture mine.



I turned, and my breath caught in my throat.



The man standing before me wore an elegant silver mask that covered the upper half of his face, but what I could see was devastating. Strong jaw, sensual lips curved in a slight smile, and eyes... God, those eyes. They were the deepest blue I'd ever seen, so dark they were almost black, but when the light hit them just right, they seemed to shimmer with silver.



""The most beautiful woman in the room wouldn't refuse a dance, would she?"" His voice was like aged whiskey—smooth, rich, with just enough roughness to make my pulse skip.



I should have said no. Should have remembered that I was hurting, that I'd just had my heart shattered. Instead, I found myself placing my hand in his and letting him lead me onto the dance floor.



""Why not?"" I heard myself say. ""Let's dance.""



He was tall—at least six and a half feet—with broad shoulders that filled out his expensive suit perfectly. When he pulled me close, I could feel the solid warmth of his chest, the careful strength in his hands as one settled on my waist and the other cradled my palm. He moved with the fluid grace of a predator.



""I've been watching you since you walked in,"" he murmured near my ear, his breath sending shivers down my spine. ""You're absolutely captivating.""



The compliment should have felt empty—we were strangers, after all—but something in his voice made it feel genuine. Like he really saw me, not just another pretty face in a crowd.



""You're not from around here, are you?"" I found myself asking, tilting my head back to look into those mesmerizing eyes.



""What gave me away?"" There was amusement in his voice, and I could see his lips curve into a more genuine smile.



""You don't feel... local."" It was hard to explain, but his scent was different from the wolves I'd grown up with. Richer, more complex. Like expensive cologne mixed with something wild and untamed that made my newly awakened wolf pace restlessly.



""Very perceptive."" His hand on my waist tightened slightly, drawing me closer until there was barely an inch of space between us. ""I'm here for the Assembly tomorrow, like most of the out-of-town wolves. Though I have to say, if I'd known the local hospitality was so... enticing, I would have arrived sooner.""



The way he said 'enticing' made heat pool low in my belly. This was dangerous—I could feel it in every instinct I possessed. But after tonight, after Gabriel and Valerie and my so-called parents, I didn't want to be safe anymore.



""And what about you?"" he continued, spinning me slowly before pulling me back against his chest. ""Let me guess—dragged here by a well-meaning friend who thought you needed to get out more?""



I laughed despite myself. ""Something like that. Though her methods are a bit more... aggressive than most.""



""Good friends are like that."" His thumb traced a small circle on my palm, such a simple touch but it sent electricity shooting up my arm. ""They know what we need even when we don't.""



We moved together like we'd been dancing for years instead of minutes, our bodies finding a rhythm that felt as natural as breathing. The alcohol had loosened my inhibitions, but it was more than that. There was something about this man that called to the deepest part of me, something that made my wolf want to arch into his touch like a cat seeking warmth.



""You have beautiful eyes,"" he said suddenly, his voice dropping to barely above a whisper. ""Like emeralds in moonlight.""



""I could say the same,"" I replied, mesmerized by the way his eyes seemed to catch and hold the light. ""I've never seen eyes quite like yours.""



Something flickered across his expression—too quick for me to catch. ""Haven't you?""



Before I could ask what he meant, he was spinning me again, and when I came back to face him, his expression had returned to that charming, mysterious smile.



The song was ending, but neither of us made any move to separate. If anything, he held me closer, his hand sliding from my waist to the small of my back.



""I think I need some fresh air.""



""Come with me."" He led me toward a dim corridor that led to the emergency exit.



""I really want to kiss you. May I?"" I nodded.



He looked into my eyes, his hand caressing the back of my neck, and our lips met. It started gentle but quickly deepened; he pressed me against the wall, the kiss becoming more intense, almost suffocating us. When he broke the kiss to let us breathe, we gazed into each other's eyes—like pouring gasoline on fire.



In that instant, I saw his eyes exposed under the mask—deep blue eyes flickering with silver light in the moonlight. I had never seen such eyes before. My heart was shocked, but my body craved him even more.



...



Chapter 3



Seraphina's POV



His hand slid from my waist to my thigh, lifting my leg to his waist. By then I was completely lost, feeling his body pressed against mine. I was desperately craving, pulling him closer, wrapping my leg around his waist.



""Your kissing skills are great."" I smiled at him, feeling tremors throughout my body.



He kissed me all the way to the top floor, finally even carrying me in his arms. We entered a luxurious suite, and as soon as we entered, his hand slipped under my skirt, caressing my most sensitive places. When his fingers explored inside, I moaned softly. ""You're so incredible. "" he said, kissing me even more forcefully.



I could feel the chemical reaction between our breaths, this attraction was so strong, as if it was arranged by fate. He quickly unzipped his pants, his movements as skilled as if he had done it countless times, tore off my underwear, and caressed my entrance as if asking for permission. He looked into my eyes again and asked:



""What do you want me to do?""



""I want you inside me right now."" I responded shamelessly, already burning with desire. I had never been like this before—usually I would have retreated the moment he grabbed my hand, but tonight I promised to enjoy myself fully, to live in the moment if I met interesting people. And that's exactly what I was doing, living in the moment.



Hearing my words, he slowly entered me, watching me throw my head back, savoring every inch of him—he was really big. He took the opportunity to leave a string of kiss marks on my neck. When he was completely inside, he paused and whispered in my ear: ""Now I'm going to move.""



He withdrew only to thrust back with full force this time, the feeling was so incredible. I was completely lost, driven mad by his crazy movements as he went in and out of me frantically.



We lost control, completely lost ourselves, as if nothing else existed around us. I felt my vision blur as the climax began to build, and I moaned softly in his ear. At that moment, he seemed to go crazy, lifting my other leg to his waist as well, and I wrapped both legs tightly around him. He kissed me intensely, thrusting into me even more forcefully—that was heaven on earth.



I moaned in his mouth and reached an incredible climax, but he didn't stop, and soon another climax began to build. I climaxed again, more intensely than before, leaving me almost unable to breathe. When I climaxed, he whispered that feeling me pulsing around him brought him close to his limit, and soon I felt his burning release inside me.



""You're really amazing."" He kissed my neck, whispering in my ear.



Perhaps it was the alcohol driving me, or perhaps his rich scent made me dizzy. I don't know how many times we did it, my last memory stopped at him kissing me, softly asking what my name was, and I no longer had the strength to answer.



The next morning, I woke up with my head pounding like a jackhammer, feeling like someone had taken a sledgehammer to my skull. The bed beside me was cold and empty—nothing but rumpled sheets where he had been. If it weren't for the purple kiss marks scattered across my neck and collarbone, I might have convinced myself that the entire night was just some vivid, alcohol-fueled dream.



I stumbled out of bed on unsteady legs, my body still aching in places that reminded me exactly how real last night had been. The mysterious man had vanished without a trace—no note, no phone number, not even a stray piece of clothing. Even after everything we'd shared, we'd never removed our masks. I had given my virginity to a complete stranger on the eve of my eighteenth birthday.



""Sera.""



The voice exploded in my mind like a thunderclap, making me jump so violently I nearly fell over. My heart hammered against my ribs as I spun around the empty hotel room, searching for the source.



""Who's there?"" I whispered, panic creeping into my voice.



""Relax, it's me—I'm your wolf. You can call me Ayla.""



The realization hit me like a bucket of ice water. My wolf. Of course! At eighteen, I'd finally awakened my wolf consciousness. I'd heard stories of exceptionally gifted wolves who could communicate with their inner beasts from childhood—Valerie had been bragging about talking to her wolf since she was twelve. But naturally, someone like me would be a late bloomer even in this.



""Oh God, Ayla..."" I sank onto the edge of the bed, running my hands through my tangled hair. ""I'm so sorry. With everything that happened yesterday, I completely forgot. It's... it's wonderful to finally meet you.""



""We have much to talk,"" Ayla's voice was warm but urgent in my mind, ""but first—""



My phone's shrill ringtone cut through our mental conversation like a knife. I lunged for it, seeing Ophelia's name flashing on the screen along with a notification showing twelve missed calls. My stomach dropped.



""Sera!"" Ophelia's voice erupted through the speaker before I could even say hello, pure fury radiating through every syllable. ""Where the hell did you disappear to? I've been worried sick! If you don't have the explanation of the century, I swear on the Moon Goddess I will hunt you down and tear you apart with my bare hands!""



""Ophelia, I'm so sorry—"" I began, but she cut me off.



""Sorry? SORRY? Do you have any idea how terrified I was? A whole night! I thought someone had kidnapped you or worse!""



Guilt crashed over me in waves. I took a shaky breath and launched into the whole tale—the mysterious man, the dancing, the passion, waking up alone with nothing but marks on my skin and a splitting headache to show for it.



The line went dead silent. For a moment, I wondered if the call had dropped.



Then Ophelia's voice came back, but now it was filled with barely contained excitement rather than rage. ""Oh my God, Sera! You actually did it! You had a one-night stand with a gorgeous mystery man!"" She paused, and I could practically hear her grinning. ""Okay, I'm officially no longer mad at you. In fact, I'm proud of you! After what that bastard Gabriel did, you deserved a night of mind-blowing passion.""



Relief flooded through me, but then her tone shifted slightly. ""Though please tell me you two were smart about protection...""



The question hung in the air like a sword about to drop. My stomach plummeted.



""Oh shit,"" I breathed, my face draining of all color.

I used to have a ton of friends that I’d meet up with regularly, then back in 2021 that all changed. I won’t go into the details of why because they’re long and not really that relevant, but I had a major falling out with one of my core friendship groups. Since then I’ve basically found it really difficult to make friends again. I’m aware that the trauma of that moment has a part to play, but I’m here now. I do still have a few friends but two of them live far away and the others rarely reach out (same with me). I assumed until recently that it was normal to never meet up with friends for months on end because it’s ’hard to find the time’ when you get into your mid-late 20s. But it suddenly dawned on me that even the people I know who are really busy meet up with their friends for coffees or catchups at least 3-4 times a month. On the rare occasion that does happen for me, I just count the minutes until it’s over. It’s not because I don’t like the person, but because I’ve gotten so used to the comfort of being on my own (I say that loosely as I live with my partner). 

Again, no idea if this kind of behaviour can stem from E9 S/O blindness or just (?)trauma(?). I’m thinking it’s probably a mix of both because I’ve always struggled socially 😅 I’m interested to hear what you guys think. ",1,1758528492.0,Enneagram,1,1.0,False

I don’t even think I’m regular independent. Bang average independence for my age.

What I can’t do, I get help with, but if it’s just the chores strictly surrounding myself, I’ve never had any issues. I manage that around my job and school, and it’s never been a problem.

However. I’ve been here all of 24 hours and I can feel my brain cells going away. I somehow overpacked and underpacked. I brought dessert to introduce myself to my flatmates (who are lovely, might I add, and also very independent adults) and no one ate it. I burned my toast. My coffee tasted weird. I forgot to buy pepper for my eggs, ducked into the Co Op, found out it costs £3 and just left in a state of apparent shell shock.

1nngisz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufyh/comments/1nngisz/got_started_on_the_yard/,Got started on the yard,"I should have taken some pictures today but honestly it does not look that much better than when I started but I feel deeply accomplished at the moment just getting started. I have been in quite the rut for *checks watch* pretty much a full year. I have had a hoarding problem over the years due to growing up in poverty and also a hoarder type situation (we lived with my great uncle and he ""recycled"" which means the back yard was full of metal appliances, etc. that he would take apart and sell the scrap, so basically a junk yard) anyway I didn't really put it together that growing up in that environment has led to my current habits. I am doing EMDR therapy but it's going to be a long road (maybe, I'm not actually sure)

Anyway, in 2018-2019 I did the konmari method and I went through everything except sentimental items. My father died in 2017 and I *still* haven't gone through the photos I got from his house to figure out which to keep. Anyway, Konmari was really good for me and I learned a lot about myself and what I like. I got rid of years of crap I never used and had negative feelings about. It was fricking awesome! But I have since reverted back to my old ways.

In 2020 as you know COVID hit and then I was in shelter in place for 1.5(ish?) years and I was bored out of my mind and insanely anxious so I collected starter items for every hobby known to man, all kinds of costumes and different clothes for ""after quarantine"". I also took walks and collected stuff my neighbors put outside for free. I had plans for all of it but it's all just become clutter. Also with the supply chain issues during COVID my newly found security feelings (if I really want this item I can get it again, but I probably won't) from doing konmari went completely out the window due to the supply chain issues. All the feelings I had about not needing to get a 36 pack of toilet paper for instance were shattered. So here I am still buying in bulk for 1 but COVID is over. I have way too much stuff. 

I got rid of most of the hobby stuff except for candlemaking stuff but guess what I took up gardening 3 years ago and I love it but my gardening habits are not tidy, I love my garden but it is not Pinterest worthy for sure LOL. It pretty much just looks like my yard is full of trash and overgrown plants. I had a pretty booming garden in spring this year but my mom got sick and I was a wreck and then I was on vacation for 2 weeks and pretty much stopped caring for it even what I got back.

So today I worked on the yard. I only threw away trash today and plastic pots too brittle to use and a few novelty gardening items that didn't work for me. I got a lot of weeds out of there as well and cut down old dead plants (such as a tomato from 3 years ago that died a long time ago). I also planted purple cabbage, yellow cauliflower, sweet potatoes and some brussel sprouts. I also picked up some nice flowers and am planting those around as well for the butterflies. It looks much better, but I also use my old dead plants as mulch so I pretty much just lay down dead dried plants around my plants. It works for me but it doesn't look too too tidy but I'm waiting on my rabbit poo hookup so I can pick up some bags of spent rabbit bedding and straw which looks much more uniform and is dynamite for the garden and then I will compost the stuff I am using as mulch for now.

I also had some tomatoes fermenting in water for like 2 weeks (it's part of a process to get the seeds out and clean them) but I had 12+ varieties of tomatoes to save seeds from so I had a bunch of them in the living room labeled so I got those out of the living room, rinsed and labeled the seeds and spread them out on coffee filters to dry and be put away in another week. The tomato situation was really stressing me out because I did not think ahead and I put some of them in open containers to ferment in the living room and it smelled quite off when you walked into the house. Not a good feeling! Anyway I'm getting that squared away. 

Anyway this is a long post but I am really proud I started on the yard. I have also started getting rid of stuff inside the house as well I took 3 bags to the thrift store today. 

Stuff to get rid of from the yard:
- A wooden falling apart tabletop that technically belongs to my landlord but is not even meant for outdoor so it is falling apart and looks awful.
- bike 1 
- bike 2: burning man bike (asses and get rid of if needed)
- both bbqs (get a proper bbq that I didn't find in the side of the road and isn't falling apart)
- 3 drawer bin
- irrigation tubing, (use it or lose it!!)
- white tiles
- agaves (put them in pots and put out for free)

Other to-dos:
- Consolidate plants such as geraniums
- reinforce wine barrels for planting (20 minutes each barrel, make sure batteries are charged)
- acquire pond liner
- make wine barrel pond
- put pond plants in pond
- get compost for beds
- plant blueberries in barrels
- yucca? 
- and much more!!!",3,1758528123.0,ufyh,0,1.0,False

It helped me power through workouts and stay alert throughout my day, making it easier to make healthier choices.

&#x200B;

\*\*Enhanced Mental Clarity: ★★★★★ (5/5)\*\*

Java Burn doesn't just target physical weight loss; it also supports mental clarity and focus. The blend of natural ingredients, including nootropics, contributed to improved cognitive function. This mental boost helped me stay on track with my weight loss goals by reducing cravings and emotional eating.

&#x200B;

\*\*Natural Ingredients: ★★★★★ (5/5)\*\*

Java Burn's use of natural ingredients is commendable. It contains a blend of powerful compounds like green tea extract, green coffee bean extract, and more, which are backed by scientific research for their weight management benefits. Knowing that I was consuming a product with safe and natural ingredients gave me confidence in its effectiveness and safety.

1nnggfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1nnggfv/help_anyone_have_a_link_to_reclaiming_my_dream/,"Help!! Anyone have a link to ""Reclaiming My Dream Game""","I stared at my computer screen, my fingers frozen above the keyboard. This couldn't be happening. I blinked hard, hoping the words would rearrange themselves into something that made sense, but they remained unchanged, mocking me with their permanence.

""Groundbreaking New Mobile Game 'Dreamscape' Launches Today - Lead Developer Amanda Walsh Revolutionizes Gaming Industry.""

My stomach dropped as if I'd been pushed from a high cliff. Dreamscape. My game. My creation. Five years of sleepless nights, of coding until my vision blurred, of meticulous world-building and problem-solving. Every pixel, every line of code, every character arc—all mine. And now, somehow, it belonged to Amanda Walsh.

I scrolled frantically through the company website's press release, each word a fresh knife in my chest.

""...Walsh's technical brilliance has created an unprecedented gaming experience...""

""...her innovative approach to interactive storytelling...""

""...a testament to the creative vision of Amanda Walsh...""

My hands began to shake. The room seemed to spin around me as rage and disbelief collided in my chest. This was more than theft—it was erasure. They hadn't just stolen my work; they'd stolen my existence.

I pushed back from my desk so violently that my chair slammed against the wall behind me. Several developers in nearby cubicles looked up, startled by the noise, but I barely registered their presence. Blood pounded in my ears as I strode across the open-plan office floor, my vision tunneling until I could see only one person: Amanda Walsh, standing by the coffee machine, laughing with two marketing executives.

She saw me coming and had the audacity to smile—a slow, satisfied curl of her lips that told me everything I needed to know. This was no mistake. This was calculated theft.

""What the hell is this?"" I demanded, thrusting my phone in her face with the press release displayed. My voice came out steadier than I expected, considering the hurricane raging inside me.

Amanda's smile didn't falter as she glanced at my phone, then back at me. She tucked a perfect strand of blonde hair behind her ear, a gesture I'd seen her perform countless times when she was about to manipulate someone.

""Oh, Victoria,"" she said, her voice dripping with false sympathy. ""I was going to talk to you about that. Ryan thought it would be more... marketable coming from me."" She emphasized the word 'marketable' with a subtle glance at my worn jeans and simple blouse, so quick that only I caught it.

The office had gone silent. I could feel the eyes of every developer, designer, and marketing person on us, but I didn't care. Five years of my life had just been stolen.

""Marketable?"" I repeated, my voice rising. ""That game is my creation. Every line of code, every design element—all of it came from me. You've never written a single function in your life!""

""Victoria."" Ryan's voice cut through the tension like a cold blade.

I turned to see my husband standing in the doorway of his corner office, his expression a mixture of annoyance and something else—something that looked disturbingly like contempt. He walked toward us with measured steps, his expensive shoes clicking against the polished concrete floor.

""This is highly unprofessional,"" he said, his voice low but carrying across the silent office. ""If you have concerns, we can discuss them in private, not create a scene in front of the entire staff.""

""Unprofessional?"" I echoed in disbelief. ""What's unprofessional is stealing someone's work and giving credit to someone else!""

Ryan's jaw tightened. He glanced around at our audience, clearly calculating the optics of the situation.

""You're obviously upset,"" he said dismissively, ""and clearly not thinking straight. This sounds like unprofessional jealousy, and frankly, I expected better from you."" He turned to the office at large. ""Everyone, back to work. The launch is today, and we have metrics to track.""

With that, he placed his hand on the small of Amanda's back—a gesture that was far too intimate for a boss and his executive assistant—and guided her away, leaving me standing alone in the middle of the office floor, humiliation burning through me like acid.

As my colleagues awkwardly returned to their tasks, avoiding eye contact with me, I felt something inside me harden. This wasn't over. Not by a long shot.

Hours later, I sat across from Ryan in our sterile penthouse living room, the city lights of San Francisco twinkling beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows. The beautiful view that had once made me feel on top of the world now seemed to mock my powerlessness.

""I want answers, Ryan,"" I said, my voice tight with controlled fury. ""Why would you do this?""

He looked at me over the rim of his whiskey glass, his eyes cold and calculating. ""It's business, Victoria. Nothing personal.""

""Nothing personal?"" I repeated incredulously. ""You stole my work and gave it to your assistant. How is that not personal?""

He set his glass down with deliberate care. ""I need you to be generous here, Victoria. Sign over the rights formally. It would be best for everyone.""

In that moment, looking into the eyes of the man I had once loved beyond reason, I realized I was staring at a stranger. And worse—an enemy.
Chapter 2

I didn't sleep that night. How could I? The betrayal cut too deep, leaving me wide awake as moonlight filtered through our bedroom window. Ryan hadn't come home—probably celebrating with Amanda. The thought made my stomach turn.

By dawn, I'd made my decision. I wouldn't just roll over and accept this theft. I opened my laptop and began compiling evidence—the digital journal I'd kept throughout Dreamscape's development, complete with timestamps, code snippets, and design notes dating back five years. Every breakthrough, every challenge, every late night documented in meticulous detail.

My fingers flew across the keyboard as I drafted a formal complaint to the board of directors. Each word was precise, clinical, detached from the rage simmering beneath my skin. This wasn't about emotions; this was about facts. And the facts were irrefutable.

""I can prove, beyond any reasonable doubt, that Dreamscape is my intellectual creation,"" I wrote, attaching file after file of evidence. ""Amanda Walsh has never contributed a single line of code to this project, nor has she participated in any design meetings prior to the game's completion.""

I hit send at 7:30 AM, just as the office would be coming to life. Then I dressed carefully, choosing a crisp white blouse and tailored black pants—armor for the battle ahead.

The emergency board meeting was scheduled for noon. I arrived early, clutching a tablet with all my evidence, and took a seat at the long mahogany table. Board members filtered in, their expressions ranging from curious to uncomfortable. None would meet my eyes.

Ryan entered last, Amanda trailing behind him like a shadow. He didn't look surprised to see me—he'd been expecting this. The realization sent a chill down my spine.

""Thank you all for coming on such short notice,"" Ryan began, his voice smooth as silk. ""Unfortunately, we're dealing with a serious situation that requires immediate attention.""

I straightened, ready to present my case, but Ryan continued before I could speak.

""It has come to my attention that my wife, Victoria, is claiming ownership of our company's newest release, Dreamscape."" He sighed dramatically. ""This is not only false but potentially amounts to corporate espionage.""

The room went silent. Corporate espionage? I felt the blood drain from my face.

""What are you talking about?"" I demanded, my voice shaking despite my best efforts. ""I created Dreamscape. Everyone in the development department knows that.""

Ryan's smile didn't reach his eyes. ""Victoria, we have documentation showing Amanda's leadership on this project from inception. Your claims appear to be an attempt to undermine a successful product launch out of personal jealousy.""

""That's absurd!"" I opened my tablet, frantically pulling up my evidence. ""I have five years of development logs—""

""Logs that could easily have been fabricated,"" Ryan cut in smoothly. ""The board doesn't need to see your manufactured evidence.""

I looked around the table, searching for any ally, any face that showed doubt about Ryan's version of events. I found none.

""Furthermore,"" Ryan continued, ""these baseless accusations are grounds for immediate termination. However, given our... personal relationship, I'm willing to be lenient—provided this matter is dropped immediately.""

The threat hung in the air, crystal clear. My job for my silence.

""This is theft,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ""You know it, and I know it.""

Ryan's expression hardened. ""That's enough, Victoria. The board has more important matters to discuss."" He turned to the others. ""I believe we're done here.""

One by one, the board members filed out, leaving me alone with the crushing weight of what had just happened. Not only had my work been stolen, but now my professional reputation was being systematically destroyed by my own husband.

The next morning, I arrived at the office to find an email waiting in my inbox. The company-wide announcement stated that Amanda Walsh had been promoted to Chief Development Officer, effective immediately. My access to the Dreamscape servers had been revoked, and I was being reassigned to a minor support project on the opposite side of the building.

As I gathered my few personal items to move to my new desk—a cramped space near the bathroom, far from the development team—I caught the sympathetic glances of my former colleagues. Some looked away quickly, afraid to be associated with me. Others offered small, sad smiles that said everything: they knew the truth, but they were too afraid to speak up.

I set my box down at my new desk and stared at the blank monitor. This wasn't just about a game anymore. This was war—and Ryan had no idea who he was really fighting.
Chapter 3

The morning after my reassignment, I walked into the office to find an email announcing a 'special celebration coffee break' for senior management. No invitation for me, of course. I wasn't senior management anymore—I was the crazy woman who'd been demoted to tech support after falsely claiming credit for Amanda Walsh's 'brilliant innovation.'

I watched from my new desk near the bathroom as they gathered in the glass-walled conference room. Amanda stood at the center, her blonde hair perfectly styled, wearing a dress that probably cost more than my monthly salary. She was laughing, touching Ryan's arm as she spoke, her eyes constantly seeking his approval.

'She doesn't even know what a recursive function is,' I muttered, my fingers gripping my coffee mug so tightly I feared it might shatter.

Liam Evans, my senior programmer, paused by my desk. 'This is wrong, Victoria,' he whispered, his eyes darting nervously toward Ryan's office. 'We all know it.'

'Then why isn't anyone saying anything?' I asked, unable to keep the bitterness from my voice.

He looked down, shame coloring his features. 'You know why.'

I did know. Fear. Mortgages to pay, families to support. Ryan had made an example of me—cross him, and your career would be destroyed.

Through the glass, I watched Amanda raise her coffee cup in a toast. 'To new responsibilities,' she announced loudly enough for her voice to carry. Several colleagues glanced in my direction, their expressions a mixture of pity and relief that they weren't in my position.

* * *

Two weeks later, I sat in the back row of the grand ballroom at the Game Developers Conference in Los Angeles. I hadn't planned to attend, but something drove me here—perhaps the masochistic need to witness firsthand how completely my life's work had been stolen.

The Innovation Award was the last category of the night. My heart hammered against my ribs as the presenter opened the envelope.

'And the winner is... Dreamscape by Mitchell Tech Solutions!'

The crowd erupted in applause. I remained motionless, watching as Ryan and Amanda rose from their front-row seats. They walked hand-in-hand to the stage, fingers intertwined in a display that went far beyond professional collegiality. The spotlight followed them, illuminating Amanda's sequined gown and Ryan's satisfied smile.

She stepped to the microphone first, clutching the crystal trophy like it was her firstborn child.

'This is such an incredible honor,' she gushed, her voice echoing through the ballroom. 'Dreamscape was a labor of love, a vision I've carried for years.'

Each word was a dagger. Years? She hadn't even known about the project until I was nearly finished with it.

'I have so many people to thank,' she continued, 'but most importantly...' She turned to Ryan, her expression softening into something intimate and possessive. 'My life partner, Ryan Mitchell, who believed in me when no one else did.'

Life partner.

The room spun around me. Not boss. Not CEO. Life partner. She'd just publicly declared their relationship—their affair—to the entire industry. And Ryan stood there beaming, his hand at the small of her back, nodding as if this was completely normal.

I couldn't breathe. The betrayal was no longer private; it was being broadcast, celebrated. People were applauding my husband and his mistress as they stood on stage, accepting an award for my creation.

Somehow I made it through the rest of the ceremony. As soon as it ended, I slipped out a side door before anyone could see the tears threatening to spill down my cheeks.

* * *

Back in my hotel room, I sank onto the bed, no longer able to contain the sobs that wracked my body. I opened my laptop with trembling hands and found the livestream of the ceremony, torturing myself by replaying Amanda's acceptance speech.

'My life partner, Ryan Mitchell...'

The tears came harder now, staining the pristine white hotel pillowcase. Five years of work stolen. My marriage publicly shattered. My professional reputation in tatters.

I curled into myself, feeling smaller and more alone than I ever had in my life. But as I lay there, something shifted inside me—the pain crystallizing into something harder, colder, more focused.

I reached for my phone and opened my family group chat. I hadn't contacted them in months, determined to make it on my own. But now, with shaking fingers, I typed a message and attached a link to the awards ceremony.

'I need help. It's time you knew what my husband has done.'

The Chen family had remained in the shadows of my life for years. But shadows could be powerful things when they belonged to one of the wealthiest families in Asia. And Ryan Mitchell was about to learn exactly who he had betrayed.",1,1758527873.0,novelsfree,1,1.0,False

1nnga9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfyChair/comments/1nnga9r/whats_the_best_chair_for_reading/,What’s the best chair for reading?,"Here’s a full essay-style reddit post you could use as a reply to that question:

When people ask me “what’s the best chair for reading?” I usually tell them there isn’t a single universal answer—because the *best* chair is the one that supports your body type, your reading habits, and the space you’re in. That said, I’ve spent an embarrassing amount of time studying ergonomics (and trial-testing more chairs than I’d like to admit), so let me break down what actually matters if you want to read for long stretches without fidgeting, cramping, or dozing off too soon.

**1. Ergonomic support comes first.**  
If you’re reading for more than 20 minutes at a time, posture matters. A chair with proper lumbar support and a seat depth that matches your leg length will keep you comfortable far longer than a trendy armchair with flat cushions. High-back chairs are underrated because they let you rest your head and neck during long reading sessions, which is a lifesaver if you read before bed.

**2. Armrests are non-negotiable for most people.**  
A lot of people don’t realize how much weight your forearms carry when holding a book or e-reader. Having padded, well-placed armrests means you won’t end up with sore shoulders after an hour. Personally, I prefer chairs with slightly lower, wider arms—perfect for resting a book or even balancing a cup of tea.

**3. The material changes the whole experience.**  
Leather looks classy, but it can get hot or sticky if you’re reading for hours. Fabric and microfiber tend to be cozier, breathable, and feel less “slippery” when you shift positions. I’ve found that textured upholstery actually keeps me more anchored and less likely to slouch.

**4. Recline and angle options are underrated.**  
One of the best upgrades I ever made was moving from a stiff accent chair to a chair with an adjustable recline. Reading at a slight recline (think 100–110° angle rather than a flat 90°) reduces pressure on the lower back and makes holding a book at eye level much easier. If you don’t want a big recliner, even a modest tilt can make a huge difference.

**5. My personal favorites.**

* **The classic wingback chair**: timeless, supportive, and often paired with an ottoman. Great if you want a cozy “reading nook” vibe.
* **Ergonomic office chairs (the higher-end ones)**: not as romantic looking, but they’re unbeatable for posture and comfort if you read at a desk or with a tablet.
* **The Eames lounge chair (or similar recliners)**: expensive, but genuinely engineered for long comfort sessions. I’ve never sat in one without wanting to read for hours.
* **Affordable sleeper chairs / armchairs with ottomans**: if you’re budget-minded, pairing a decently padded armchair with a separate ottoman gets you 80% of the benefit of high-end recliners.

**6. Don’t forget the extras.**  
A good reading chair isn’t just about the chair—it’s about the ecosystem around it. A side table for your coffee, a lamp at the correct height and color temperature, and maybe a small throw blanket will turn even a budget chair into a perfect reading zone.

So, “best chair” really depends on whether you want formality, coziness, or strict ergonomics. For me, the sweet spot ended up being a medium-firm fabric recliner with supportive arms and an ottoman. It hits all the marks: posture support, ability to shift positions, and the right amount of coziness.

If you want one takeaway: don’t just buy the chair that *looks* good in the catalog. Think about how your body feels after an hour in it. Reading is supposed to transport your mind, not torture your back.",1,1758527159.0,ComfyChair,0,1.0,False

I dragged myself down the cobblestone path. My body ached. My feet hurt. But my heart was singing. 

""Just a few more hours,"" I whispered. ""Until tonight."" 

Tonight was everything. No more going back to that house. No more pretending they were family. 

I'd already asked for time off work. My boss spat at me. Called me lazy. Typical. Omegas always got the worst treatment. 

But I didn't care tonight. 

I was going to Gabriel's. My boyfriend. Soon-to-be fiancé. 

Tomorrow was the Lunar Assembly. Sacred ceremony. Wolves finding their mates under the Moon Goddess. Tomorrow was also my eighteenth birthday. Finally old enough. 

Gabriel promised we'd bond tomorrow. I could escape forever. 

Gabriel. Rich. Gorgeous. An Alpha's brother. Sure, I was just an omega. But Gabriel said bloodlines didn't matter. Love mattered. 

I practically skipped toward his house. My heart hammered with excitement. Beautiful stone building in the center of town. So much better than our pathetic wooden shack. Soon I'd live here. With Gabriel. Forever. 

I knocked eagerly. 

Nothing. 

My smile faltered. That's... odd. Gabriel said he'd be waiting. He promised. 

I tried the handle. Unlocked. Relief flooded through me. He must be inside. Maybe preparing a surprise? 

""Gabriel? It's me!"" I called out cheerfully. 

Silence. 

Wait. What was that? Sounds from upstairs. My heart lifted again. He was home after all. 

Then I heard it clearly. 

Laughter. 

Female laughter. 

Moaning. 

My world stopped spinning. No. No, that couldn't be— 

My feet moved on their own. Step by step. Up the stairs. Each step felt like walking to my execution. 

The sounds grew louder. Clearer. Destroying me with every breath. 

Gasps. Bed springs creaking. A voice that made my soul shatter. 

""Oh God, Gabriel... right there..."" 

Valerie. My stepsister. 

My brain refused to process it. This wasn't happening. This was a nightmare. I'd wake up any second. 

The bedroom door hung slightly open. Like a cruel invitation to witness my destruction. I saw them. 

Gabriel's muscled back. Moving. Valerie's pale body beneath him. Her golden hair fanned across his pillow like a victory flag. 

No no no no no. 

""You feel so much better than I imagined,"" Gabriel panted. 

My heart exploded into a thousand pieces. Each word was a dagger. 

Valerie laughed. That cruel, sharp sound I knew so well. ""Better than that pathetic omega sister of mine, I bet. Poor little Sera probably doesn't even know what to do with a real man."" 

The air left my lungs. I couldn't breathe. Couldn't think. Could only feel the agony ripping through my chest. 

""Don't."" Gabriel's voice was rough. ""Don't mention her when we're like this."" 

""Why not?"" Valerie's fingers traced his spine like she owned him. ""After tomorrow, she'll know exactly where she stands. An omega like her could never satisfy you."" 

Each word was a physical blow. I stumbled backward, gasping for air. My shoulder slammed into the wall. The sound echoed like a gunshot. 

""What was that?"" Valerie hissed. 

My wolf surged forward. Rage I'd never felt before. My foot connected with the door. It crashed against the wall. 

""WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?"" 

They jumped apart. Gabriel nearly fell off the bed scrambling for his pants. Valerie just sat up. Didn't even cover herself. 

""Seraphina!"" Gabriel went white. ""I can explain—"" 

""Explain?"" My voice cracked. ""Explain how you're screwing my sister?"" 

""It's not what you think—"" 

""IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK!"" Tears streamed down my face. ""You lying, cheating bastard!"" 

Valerie stretched. Finally reached for Gabriel's shirt. ""Oh, sister dear. You really thought he'd choose you?"" She tilted her head. Mock sympathy. ""How cute."" 

""Valerie, don't,"" Gabriel warned. But his voice was weak. 

""Don't what? Tell her the truth?"" Valerie stood up slowly. ""That Mom and Dad have known about us for months? That they practically threw me at Gabriel because they were embarrassed by their precious Alpha family being tied to an omega reject?"" 

The world spun. ""You're lying."" 

""Am I?"" Valerie moved to the mirror. Ran her fingers through her hair. ""Why don't you go home and ask them? I'm sure they're waiting. Probably with our engagement announcement."" 

""Sera, listen—"" Gabriel finally got his pants on. ""This doesn't have to change anything between us. We can still be friends—"" 

""FRIENDS?"" I lunged toward him. He caught my wrists. 

""You need to calm down,"" he said. His grip was tight. Bruising. ""Think about your position. Your family. You don't want to make this worse."" 

I stared into his eyes. Eyes that had whispered promises just days ago. Now they were cold. Calculating. 

""Let go of me,"" I whispered. 

""Sera—"" 

""LET GO OF ME!"" 

I wrenched free and ran. I burst through our front door. Victor and Elizabeth sat calmly in the living room. An elegant invitation lay on the coffee table between them. 

They showed no surprise at my tear-stained face. 

""You already knew?"" My voice was barely a whisper. 

""Seraphina, sit down."" Victor's voice was ice. ""Yes, we know about Gabriel and Valerie. We fully support it."" 

Elizabeth picked up the invitation. Held it out. ""This is their engagement announcement. Tomorrow at the Lunar Assembly, Gabriel will propose to Valerie. They hope you'll attend as Valerie's sister."" 

I stared at the beautiful invitation. Gabriel and Valerie's names in gold. The silver Nightshadow crest. It was all real. 

""Why?"" My voice cracked. ""Why would you do this to me?"" 

""Enough!"" Victor shot to his feet. Backhanded me across the face. Hard. I crashed to the floor. My cheek burned. 

""You're nothing but an abandoned child we took in out of pity. What right do you have to insult our daughter?"" 

""You should be grateful we raised you."" Elizabeth's voice was cold. ""Now you know your place. Tomorrow you'll bless your sister's engagement. Then find yourself a suitable omega mate."" 

""I won't!"" I struggled to my feet. Tasted blood. ""I'll never bless this betrayal!"" 

Victor raised his hand again. This time I was ready. I dodged and ran for the door. 

""Get out of our house!"" Elizabeth shrieked behind me. ""Ungrateful little brat!"" 

I fled into the night. Running blindly. Tears falling like broken pearls. 

I didn't know where I was going; I only knew I couldn't stop moving or the crushing pain would swallow me whole. I didn't know how long I ran, but eventually I found myself on Main Street when a familiar voice made me stop. 

""Sera!"" 

I spun around to see Ophelia running toward me, her dark hair flying behind her. 

""I saw you run in—what happened? You look like you've seen a ghost."" 

*1*

""Worse."" I collapsed into her arms. ""I've seen the truth."" 

""Tell me."" 

So I did. Every horrible detail, every cruel word. Ophelia held me while I shook. 

""Those bastards,"" she hissed when I finished. ""All of them. Gabriel, Valerie, your so-called parents."" 

""What am I going to do?"" I cried against her shoulder. ""Tomorrow is the Lunar Assembly. Everyone will see Gabriel and Valerie's engagement. I'll be the laughingstock of the entire pack.” 

""Listen to me, Sera."" Ophelia stroked my hair gently. ""We're not waiting for that damned ceremony. Tonight, we're going to Silver Moon Harbor!” 

""What?"" I pulled back to look at her, still having tears on my face. 

""I heard there's a huge party in Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Lots of wolves from other packs who are here for tomorrow's ceremony will be there."" Ophelia's eyes sparkled with excitement. ""We're going to have some fun and forget all about these bastards and your heartless family!” 

""But... but I..."" I hesitated. As an omega, Silver Moon Harbor was completely foreign territory to me. 

""But what?"" Ophelia gripped my hands. ""Sera, you've lost everything here. Instead of staying to be humiliated tomorrow, let's go to Silver Moon Harbor and try our luck. Maybe you'll meet your real destined mate—someone who won't give a damn about your bloodline.” 

I looked into Ophelia's determined eyes, thinking about the cruel words I'd heard in Gabriel's bedroom, remembering my parents' cold faces, imagining the humiliation I'd face tomorrow… 

""Okay."" I wiped away my tears, feeling a fierce courage I'd never experienced before. ""Let's go to Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Let all those people go to hell!” 

Ophelia grinned with delight. ""Now that's my Seraphina! Come on, let's go back to my place and get ready. Tonight, we're going to show the most beautiful girl!""

# Chapter 2: Chapter 2

 

Seraphina's POV 

Ophelia dragged me back to her small apartment above the bakery, her eyes blazing with determination. ""We're not letting those bastards win,"" she declared, pulling out makeup and rifling through her closet. 

She spun around, holding up an emerald green dress that perfectly matched my eyes. ""Tonight, we show them what they lost."" 

The dress was beautiful—silky and elegant, with a flowing skirt that hugged my curves in all the right places. 

As Ophelia worked on my makeup, carefully applying smoky eyeshadow that made my green eyes pop, I felt something shifting inside me. 

""There,"" Ophelia stepped back, admiring her handiwork. ""Now you look like the goddess you are."" 

I barely recognized myself in the mirror. The woman staring back at me looked confident, mysterious, beautiful. Nothing like the broken omega who'd fled Gabriel's house just hours ago. 

""Come on,"" Ophelia grabbed my hand. ""Silver Moon Harbor awaits."" 

""I can't believe we're actually doing this,"" I whispered as we approached the grand entrance. 

""Believe it, honey,"" Ophelia grinned, straightening her own dress and passed me a mask. ""Tonight, we're not wolves from nowhere. Tonight, we're mysterious beauties who belong wherever we damn well please."" 

The ballroom took my breath away. Crystal chandeliers cast rainbow patterns across marble floors, and hundreds of werewolves in elegant attire mingled beneath soaring ceilings. Everyone wore elaborate masks, adding an air of mystery to the already intoxicating atmosphere. 

""Holy shit,"" I breathed, then immediately covered my mouth. 

She pressed two tequila shots into my hands, raising her own. ""To new beginnings and leaving the past in the dust!"" 

The alcohol burned down my throat, but it was a good burn—cleansing, like it was washing away the bitter taste of betrayal. Ophelia immediately ordered two more. 

""I don't usually drink this much,"" I protested weakly. 

""You don't usually find your boyfriend screwing your sister either,"" she pointed out. ""Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures."" 

By the third round, I was feeling deliciously dizzy and incredibly free. The pain was still there, but muffled now, wrapped in cotton and shoved into a corner of my mind. 

""Dance with me,"" Ophelia pulled me toward the crowded dance floor, and for the first time in hours, I smiled genuinely. 

We lost ourselves in the music, spinning and laughing like we didn't have a care in the world. Other wolves watched us with interest, but I was too caught up in the moment to care. This was what freedom felt like. 

When a slow song began to play, I was about to suggest we get some air when I felt a warm hand capture mine. 

I turned, and my breath caught in my throat. 

The man standing before me wore an elegant silver mask that covered the upper half of his face, but what I could see was devastating. Strong jaw, sensual lips curved in a slight smile, and eyes... God, those eyes. They were the deepest blue I'd ever seen, so dark they were almost black, but when the light hit them just right, they seemed to shimmer with silver. 

""The most beautiful woman in the room wouldn't refuse a dance, would she?"" His voice was like aged whiskey—smooth, rich, with just enough roughness to make my pulse skip. 

I should have said no. Should have remembered that I was hurting, that I'd just had my heart shattered. Instead, I found myself placing my hand in his and letting him lead me onto the dance floor. 

""Why not?"" I heard myself say. ""Let's dance."" 

He was tall—at least six and a half feet—with broad shoulders that filled out his expensive suit perfectly. When he pulled me close, I could feel the solid warmth of his chest, the careful strength in his hands as one settled on my waist and the other cradled my palm. 

""I've been watching you since you walked in,"" he murmured near my ear, his breath sending shivers down my spine. ""You're absolutely captivating."" 

The compliment should have felt empty—we were strangers, after all—but something in his voice made it feel genuine. 

""You're not from around here, are you?"" I found myself asking, tilting my head back to look into those mesmerizing eyes. 

""What gave me away?"" There was amusement in his voice, and I could see his lips curve into a more genuine smile. 

""You don't feel... local."" It was hard to explain, but his scent was different from the wolves I'd grown up with. Richer, more complex. 

""Very perceptive."" His hand on my waist tightened slightly, drawing me closer until there was barely an inch of space between us. ""I'm here for friends. I would have arrived sooner."" 

""And what about you?"" he continued, spinning me slowly before pulling me back against his chest. ""Let me guess—dragged here by a well-meaning friend as well?"" 

I laughed despite myself. ""Something like that. Though her methods are a bit more aggressive than most."" 

We moved together like we'd been dancing for years instead of minutes, our bodies finding a rhythm that felt as natural as breathing. 

""You have beautiful eyes,"" he said suddenly, his voice dropping to barely above a whisper. ""Like emeralds in moonlight."" 

""I could say the same,"" I replied, mesmerized by the way his eyes seemed to catch and hold the light. ""I've never seen eyes quite like yours."" 

The song was ending, but neither of us made any move to separate. If anything, he held me closer, his hand sliding from my waist to the small of my back. 

""I think I need some fresh air."" 

""Come with me."" He led me toward a dim corridor that led to the emergency exit. 

""I really want to kiss you. May I?"" I nodded.

# Chapter 3: Chapter 3

 

Chapter 3 

Seraphina's POV 

His hand slid from my waist to my thigh, lifting my leg to his waist. By then I was completely lost, feeling his body pressed against mine. I was desperately craving, pulling him closer, wrapping my leg around his waist. 

""Your kissing skills are great."" I smiled at him, feeling tremors throughout my body. 

He kissed me all the way to the top floor, finally even carrying me in his arms. We entered a luxurious suite, and as soon as we entered, his hand slipped under my skirt, caressing my most sensitive places. When his fingers explored inside, I moaned softly. ""You're so incredible. "" he said, kissing me even more forcefully. 

I could feel the chemical reaction between our breaths, this attraction was so strong, as if it was arranged by fate. He quickly unzipped his pants, his movements as skilled as if he had done it countless times, tore off my underwear, and caressed my entrance as if asking for permission. He looked into my eyes again and asked: 

""What do you want me to do?"" 

""I want you inside me right now."" I responded shamelessly, already burning with desire. I had never been like this before—usually I would have retreated the moment he grabbed my hand, but tonight I promised to enjoy myself fully, to live in the moment if I met interesting people. And that's exactly what I was doing, living in the moment. 

Hearing my words, he slowly entered me, watching me throw my head back, savoring every inch of him—he was really big. He took the opportunity to leave a string of kiss marks on my neck. When he was completely inside, he paused and whispered in my ear: ""Now I'm going to move."" 

He withdrew only to thrust back with full force this time, the feeling was so incredible. I was completely lost, driven mad by his crazy movements as he went in and out of me frantically. 

We lost control, completely lost ourselves, as if nothing else existed around us. I felt my vision blur as the climax began to build, and I moaned softly in his ear. At that moment, he seemed to go crazy, lifting my other leg to his waist as well, and I wrapped both legs tightly around him. He kissed me intensely, thrusting into me even more forcefully—that was heaven on earth. 

I moaned in his mouth and reached an incredible climax, but he didn't stop, and soon another climax began to build. I climaxed again, more intensely than before, leaving me almost unable to breathe. When I climaxed, he whispered that feeling me pulsing around him brought him close to his limit, and soon I felt his burning release inside me. 

""You're really amazing."" He kissed my neck, whispering in my ear. 

Perhaps it was the alcohol driving me, or perhaps his rich scent made me dizzy. I don't know how many times we did it, my last memory stopped at him kissing me, softly asking what my name was, and I no longer had the strength to answer. 

The next morning, I woke up with my head pounding like a jackhammer, feeling like someone had taken a sledgehammer to my skull. The bed beside me was cold and empty—nothing but rumpled sheets where he had been. If it weren't for the purple kiss marks scattered across my neck and collarbone, I might have convinced myself that the entire night was just some vivid, alcohol-fueled dream. 

I stumbled out of bed on unsteady legs, my body still aching in places that reminded me exactly how real last night had been. The mysterious man had vanished without a trace—no note, no phone number, not even a stray piece of clothing. Even after everything we'd shared, we'd never removed our masks. I had given my virginity to a complete stranger on the eve of my eighteenth birthday. 

""Sera."" 

The voice exploded in my mind like a thunderclap, making me jump so violently I nearly fell over. My heart hammered against my ribs as I spun around the empty hotel room, searching for the source. 

""Who's there?"" I whispered, panic creeping into my voice. 

""Relax, it's me—I'm your wolf. You can call me Ayla."" 

The realization hit me like a bucket of ice water. My wolf. Of course! At eighteen, I'd finally awakened my wolf consciousness. I'd heard stories of exceptionally gifted wolves who could communicate with their inner beasts from childhood—Valerie had been bragging about talking to her wolf since she was twelve. But naturally, someone like me would be a late bloomer even in this. 

""Oh God, Ayla..."" I sank onto the edge of the bed, running my hands through my tangled hair. ""I'm so sorry. With everything that happened yesterday, I completely forgot. It's... it's wonderful to finally meet you."" 

""We have much to talk,"" Ayla's voice was warm but urgent in my mind, ""but first—"" 

My phone's shrill ringtone cut through our mental conversation like a knife. I lunged for it, seeing Ophelia's name flashing on the screen along with a notification showing twelve missed calls. My stomach dropped. 

""Sera!"" Ophelia's voice erupted through the speaker before I could even say hello, pure fury radiating through every syllable. ""Where the hell did you disappear to? I've been worried sick! If you don't have the explanation of the century, I swear on the Moon Goddess I will hunt you down and tear you apart with my bare hands!"" 

""Ophelia, I'm so sorry—"" I began, but she cut me off. 

""Sorry? SORRY? Do you have any idea how terrified I was? A whole night! I thought someone had kidnapped you or worse!"" 

Guilt crashed over me in waves. I took a shaky breath and launched into the whole tale—the mysterious man, the dancing, the passion, waking up alone with nothing but marks on my skin and a splitting headache to show for it. 

The line went dead silent. For a moment, I wondered if the call had dropped. 

Then Ophelia's voice came back, but now it was filled with barely contained excitement rather than rage. ""Oh my God, Sera! You actually did it! You had a one-night stand with a gorgeous mystery man!"" She paused, and I could practically hear her grinning. ""Okay, I'm officially no longer mad at you. In fact, I'm proud of you! After what that bastard Gabriel did, you deserved a night of mind-blowing passion."" 

Relief flooded through me, but then her tone shifted slightly. ""Though please tell me you two were smart about protection..."" 

The question hung in the air like a sword about to drop. My stomach plummeted. 

""Oh shit,"" I breathed, my face draining of all color. ",1,1758526837.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share my experience with keeping my planner 2026 in pristine condition. I've been using planners for years, and I've learned some valuable lessons about maintaining them properly.

First off, let's talk about why proper cleaning matters. Our planners go everywhere with us - coffee shops, office desks, and even outdoor spaces. They collect dust, coffee stains, and general grime over time. But here's the thing: you can't just use any cleaning method, or you'll risk damaging those precious pages.

I've discovered some effective cleaning techniques that work great for my planner 2026 (check it out here if you're interested: https://athometouch.com/planner-2026). Here's my step-by-step process:

1. Gentle Dusting
Start with a soft microfiber cloth to remove surface dust. Never use wet wipes directly on the pages - trust me, I learned this the hard way!

2. Cover Care
For the cover (especially if it's leather or faux leather), use a slightly damp cloth with a tiny bit of gentle soap. Always test on a small area first.

3. Page Protection
For paper pages, I use a clean eraser to remove pencil marks and smudges. Those white vinyl erasers work best and don't leave residue.

4. Binding Maintenance
Don't forget about the binding! A small, soft brush helps remove debris that gets stuck in spiral bindings or between pages.

5. Storage Solutions
When not in use, store your planner in a cool, dry place. I keep mine in a protective sleeve, which has really helped maintain its condition.

One thing that really helped me was investing in a quality planner to begin with. The one I use (available here: https://athometouch.com/planner-2026) has been incredibly durable and responds well to gentle cleaning.

Pro Tips:
- Never use harsh chemicals
- Avoid leaving your planner in direct sunlight
- Use page markers instead of folding corners
- Keep drinks and food away from your planner
- Consider using a protective cover

I've found that doing a quick cleaning routine every couple of weeks prevents major buildup and keeps my planner looking fresh. It's much easier to maintain cleanliness than to deal with set-in stains later.

Remember, your planner is an investment in your productivity and organization. Taking care of it properly ensures it'll serve you well throughout the year. These methods have worked great for me, and I hope they help you too!

Let me know if you have any questions or other cleaning tips to share. I'm always looking to learn new methods!",1,1758526718.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

I'm thinking of starting a regular social meetup for Arabic men (30+) in the area. Nothing formal or business-related - just casual coffee/food meetups every couple of weeks to chat, unwind, and meet like-minded people from the community.

The idea is that whether you're Leicester-born, new to the area, a busy dad needing a break, or just want to connect with other Arabic guys over some good food and chat (in either Arabic and English), this could be a good way to make friends - and god knows that's hard enough for men over thirty already.

I'm picturing starting with local cafes and restaurants, but open to expanding based on what the group wants - maybe movies, cultural events, whatever people are interested in.
Is there any interest in something like this? I've set up a Meetup page if anyone wants to check it out: www.meetup.com/leicester-arabic-social-club/",0,1758526575.0,leicester,0,0.4,False

As many of you might have been, I am currently deep in machine/tech discovery of Espresso machines and I am having a hard time making my decision.

Initally, I am questioning whether there is a real **benefit for me in Dual Boilers, or if Heat Exchangers is the better option.**

I come from a Sage Barista Express which is on its last months.

**Location:** Denmark / Europe.

**Preferred Drink:** Mainly Latte, Cortado but also enjoy an Espresso from time to time.

**Frequency:** 2 x Coffee every morning + more on weekends.

**Space:** I think we have pretty good space, so no worries here.

**Experience:** Been making espresso/coffee for 5 years, but no expert on more technical elements. I would like to get a bit more nerdy on the topic, but nothing too crazy :)

**Type:** Mainly looking for electric solutions.

**Candidate:** I've been looking at lot at Profitec with their Move / Jump solutions, but also Lelit Bianca V3, Rocket Appartamento.

**Grinder:** I would also need a grinder for my setup, but this is not too necessary right now.

i specifically remember going to a spot called java city… or maybe java time, my memory’s fuzzy… but it was by a grocery store. my mom would take me in the summertime, sugar ray blasting from our red honda accord, and i’d get this drink called the polar bear. i’ve been craving it like crazy, partly because i just want to taste it again, but also because it feels like a way to transport myself back to that time.

if anyone here remembers tracy back then, and especially those cafés and their polar bears, please tell me what was in it, or even just how you remember it tasting. i’d love to recreate it, not just for me but for my mom too. we still talk about how good their coffee was, and it’d be really special to bring that memory back to life.

thanks for any help! whether it’s a recipe, a wild guess, or just a “yeah, i remember those polar bears too.” nostalgia’s hitting hard, and honestly… it’s hard not to romanticize tracy sometimes. even though, let’s be real, growing up there also felt like living in a giant dust bowl full of tumbleweeds. but hey, there were some pretty great moments tucked in there too.

That even after sleeping 8 hours, your brain doesn’t shut off?  
Or that your “motivation crashes” happen right when you need clarity the most?

You might think this is just normal entrepreneur stress.  
But what if what you’re feeling is actually **energetic burnout**?

Here’s what I’ve seen (and lived) that rarely gets talked about

# The Multi-Layered Energy Drain

**Mental Load Overload**  
Women often juggle *everything*.  
It’s not just work, business—it’s family schedules, bills, relationships, client needs, content creation, marketing deadlines.  
Your brain never really switches off. This constant “mental tabbing” creates chronic fatigue.

**The “Always On” Syndrome**  
If you are a business owner, there’s no clock-out button.  
You answer DMs at midnight, create content on weekends, feel guilty if you rest.  
This boundary-less lifestyle wears down the nervous system and leads to adrenal fatigue.

# Energetic Patterns That Contribute to Burnout

**Over-Giving & Under-Receiving**  
Extra unpaid hours, bonus sessions, endless advice.  
You give more than you get back.  
Over time this imbalance creates resentment and depletion.

**Perfectionism as an Energy Vampire**  
“I’ll launch when it’s perfect.”  
Sound familiar?  
Endless revisions drain your energy. Perfectionism comes from fear that you’re not enough.

**Absorbing Emotional Labor**  
Many coaches unknowingly absorb their clients’ pain.  
Without boundaries, you become a sponge for stress that isn’t yours.

# How Burnout Shows Up in the Body

* Waking up tired, even after 8 hours of sleep
* Afternoon crashes and endless coffee refills
* Racing thoughts and tension in shoulders/jaw
* Digestive issues, decision fatigue, mental fog

Your body is literally telling you: **enough is enough**.

# The Invisible Energy Leaks

* People-pleasing and saying yes to everything
* Comparing yourself constantly on social media
* Old trauma wounds activated by business rejection
* Ancestral beliefs like “good women don’t ask for money”

These aren’t just mindset issues.  
They’re energetic drains that keep you running on empty.

Here’s the reframe:  
Burnout isn’t only about being busy.  
It’s about operating from **depleted, fear-based energy patterns**.  
And those can be shifted—cleared—at the energetic level.

Which of these patterns feels the most familiar in your life right now?

👉 And if you’re curious about how energy healing can help you break free from burnout and reclaim your energy—I’m happy to share what’s worked for me and others.

I’m a 28M and I think I’m somewhere between HS stage 1 and 2 (not fully sure). My flares usually appear in the armpit, sometimes a pimple on my face, and rarely in the groin area.

I first noticed HS symptoms in 2021 when I had just finished my postgrad. Before that, I had a pilonidal cyst surgery in 2017 which reoccurred in 2018 and required another minor surgery. I mention this because pilonidal sinus feels quite similar to HS, and I’ve read both may be linked to autoimmune issues.

What’s frustrating is managing HS while working a job now. After my pilonidal surgery, I was on 10 months of bed rest, and my weight jumped from 57 kg to 78 kg. Currently, I’m 94.5 kg.

To manage HS, the only thing I do consistently is avoid potatoes, eggplant, coffee, wine, and sugar. This sometimes helps. But whenever I drink coffee (like during work meetings), my HS tends to flare up again.

I really want to exercise, lose weight, and get back in shape, but I feel stuck and frustrated.

If anyone here has tips, personal experiences, or suggestions for managing HS—especially with lifestyle, diet, or exercise. I’d be really grateful to hear them.

1nnfx2h,https://i.redd.it/9r24db8yxnqf1.jpeg,The art of troubleshooting,"Well maybe not exactly art, more like a headache 😁 This is just a short story of my most recent escapade with a machine i own. But it's also a reminder that if I had been someone who is new to 3D Printing, and this issue occured to me, i'd probably be in a world of frustration trying to explain what is happening only through text and imagies, without knowing terminologies. On the other hand, it may also be frustrating for others trying to help out without knowing the full story, or the details. So just a reminder to always be patient with others, if we weren't patient folks, we wouldn't be in this hobby anyway 😉 (I come from an era where a benchy took 1 hour and 47 minutes)

Both these models were printed on one of my XL 5TH, both are the same exact gcode, same filament, same toolhead. 

As someone who tries to help as much as I can in troubleshooting (along with many of you), this is a very good example of how we could wreck our brains in trying to figure it out, only to find out it was simply a silly mistake. Bearing in mind that I have been using this machine religiously without issue.

The top print was the first one. As soon as I saw the result, my first instinct was to tighten the belts. The machine has over 5,000 hours on it, so it was in desperate need of a service. I tightened the belts, and also reverted the machine to a previous stable version fw (I had it running on the alpha firmware). Calibrated it and ran phase stepping. Heated up the nozzle, gave it a good clean, made sure there were no jams, opened the extruder, gave it a good clean, lubricated the gears again, and tried the print again

This time I used a different toolhead (TH5, whereas before it was TH4), just for a sanity check; the only thing that changed was the ghosting (after retuning the belts), but I still had that underextrusion around the corners. At this point, I figured it had to do with Pressure Advance, but I couldn't figure out why it's happening all of a sudden. 

At this point, each print was 8 hours long, so I was frustrated enough to go to bed and sleep on it, and get back to troubleshooting in the morning.

After a generous dose of caffeine the next morning, which I consumed while standing in front of my XL, standing up, staring it down like I was in the middle of a staredown, this little nagging feeling came over me.

I put my coffee cup down, grabbed the culprit toolhead TH4, and proceeded to take out the nozzle..... and there it was ""CHT 0.60""..... did the same on TH5, once again ""CHT 0.60"", all the other nozzles were CHT 0.40mm

About 6 months ago, I swapped out all my nozzles to CHT 0.40mm. However, for some reason, I reinstalled 0.6mm CHT Nozzles on TH4 and TH5. This is mainly a production machine, so in 99% of the cases, it only uses ABS on TH1 and TH2, sometimes TH3 for spool join purposes, which is why I never noticed this issue before.

The reason for this post is purely to share one of the many times in my career where no matter how knowledgeable you are in troubleshooting, sometimes things escape you, little things, but eventually it becomes another thing in the list of things to remember to verify, no matter how sure you are that ""it can't possibly be that simple""

We’re staying near Truc Bach Lake and luckily arrived at 7 am. That timing was perfect because we got to see how active people are in the mornings. For the past two days, I’ve been waking up at 5 am. I usually run around the lake. Yesterday, while I was exercising, a group of ladies who were dancing invited me to join them, it was so much fun! This morning at 6 am, I joined a Tai Chi group. One of the women spoke English, was very welcoming, and asked me to come again.

I do have a few questions:

* I’ve seen many people drinking a yellow-colored drink in the morning. Does anyone know what it’s called?
* On our first day, we tried at least 10 cafés, but most only served drinks. Finally, we found KUU Coffee. The owner is a lovely lady and actually serves bread and eggs, which we usually have for breakfast.
* Early this morning around 6 am, I bought fruit from a local vendor. She asked for 200k for 250 g of grapes and 1 pear. I knew it was too much, so I bargained. She didn’t speak English, so she showed me her notes to agree on a price. We agreed on 20k. I gave her a 500k note, and she returned 450k.

(Another DevylBear Hawkturion Chronicle)","  Hello, royale folks, DB Hawk3 here, with a quick yet funny moment I had last Saturday night. Now I mostly had written my take in other subreddits, either on workplace hijinks, and such, never to encounter a IDWHL event.....

          ....***until that fateful night itself!!*** And believe me, it still gave me time to laugh and reflect on it. ***(BTW, there's wasn't any evil Wappies involved, for this is rather wholesome to say the least.)***

        Picture this, yours truly was with his Dad(he didn't play into the situation)& his stepmom(she's the one whom got mixed into it) went towards the building I like to call Sky Voyer, home to different types of planes and history of them as well. It was the location for a charity gala for a non-profit organization I like to call Buddy-O, dedicated for pairing volunteers with other non-profit organizations in need of physical help.  Their theme was ***""Compassion Soars High""***(don't want to give away part of..you know what 😜)

       Well, the party was in full swing,  people mingling, appetizers rolling around, drinks flowing,  followed by taking our places at the tables located on the lower floor, dined on salad, rolls, entrees of either veg(a cooked acorn squash with veggies, lentils and grains)/surf-n-turf(a grilled steak, a baked piece of salmon,  and mashed potato topped with roasted and sautéed veggies), wine, coffee, and dessert of either teremisu or a personal lime tart. There was a drag chartreuse performer (epic in her way,almost got me verklempt over a song from the musical 'The Wiz' that was sung by the good witch before the emotional finale song ***🎶Home🎶***), a special talk from a priest, new works in a way, the emcee getting us cheering, etc. But I have to digress myself as you were about to go screaming, wHeRe'S thAT inCiDeNT?

   Hold your boots, bub, before you get angry cause the incident actually happened after it!

  Now, try to picture what I was wearing. The event had an attire request, Cocktail style. Well, I decided to simply wear my ironed white buttoned down long sleeve shirt with a black Cardan tie, a ironed dress pants, and already shined black leather loafers. This is where it'll becomes a little relevant. Now after meeting with said performer and getting a picture,  I went with my parents so they can find the bathrooms, met up with dad to which I told him there's a open bathroom at the floor below, so he told me to wait for my stepmom to finish up. I ended up sitting at the lonely seat while waiting up for her, when out of the blue, a couple of ladies were checking out the Apollo exhibition were about to ask me(at the same time, my stepmom was coming back from the restroom to meet up with me), rather quickly if I know anything about the exhibit itself. It's when I quickly and pointedly said to them, ""Sorry, I don't work here.  I'm just waiting for my stepmom."" They saw her, and the wholehearted can of confetti spilled out, with me closed eyed laughing,  the chit chat flowing, with one commenting on my fashion sense, saying that I looked like I was an usher for the building, to which I recalled seeing the workers working there on normal business hours don't normally wear anything close to mine, but it sounded more positive than negative. Then after that we giggled a little and waited for my dad to come around. Then went our way back to our homes.

   Like I had said, no angry Wappies out and about. 
As to the ladies, I hope we come across again on another gala, and if so, maybe we meet again at a set table to reminisce about this wholesome affair. Hopefully not as what you both thought whom I was. My, time flew by, got to get my beastly beauty rest, until then, take care, and love yourself,  another and keep sane and safe in this troubled world. ",1,1758524932.0,IDontWorkHereLady,0,0.67,False

(It's morning, listener is laying in bed, speaker is already up)

Good morning! Rise and shine! Did you sleep well? You don't have to answer, I know you did, you're welcome.

Where are we? Hmmm... I think I could call this ""my place"". Kind of... So - this is kind of my place.

It's already morning. You've slept for fourteen hours, cause I've had some work to do.

You might be surprised, but I'm not a man with a long-term plan. I like to go with the flow. I plan at most two or three steps ahead. Maybe that's why they still didn't catch me. How can they predict my moves if I can't predict them myself? 

Am I going to kill you? Ooooh, that's a good question. Certainly... not... yet. You're not dumb, you've seen me, I can't just let you go. But your future is still unwritten, so choose your actions wisely. First of all - get up, breakfast is ready. The bathroom is there, you should find everything you need there. You'll find some clean clothes in the closet if you want to change. Take all the time you need, we're not in a hurry. We won't start until evening.

Oh, you'll see. I promise you'll be delighted.

—

(Through whole scene speaker and listener are sitting by the table, eating breakfast, so you can use some SFX, but you have to remember they use plastic or paper tableware and cutlery)

Finally, you really took your time. I thought that it would be nice of me to wait for you and now I'm starving. Please, sit and enjoy the meal. I did everything by myself and I'm rather proud of the results. Hope you'll find something that will please your taste buds. I'm sorry for the way it is served, but I do hope we will get to the point where I would amaze you with appropriate tableware.

Poisoned?! Oh, please... Ok, so... Tea… (Sound of pouring) Cup… (Sound of drinking) You see? I'm still alive, I didn't turn into a zombie, my throat wasn't acid-ridden. Do you want that one or will you pour yourself another?

Good. Do you want me to try everything that's on the table? Cause I'll be honest, I got a bit carried away. It's not often that I have guests so I let myself show off a little. Normally I would just eat a sandwich or two. 

Wonderful, bon appetit!

Oh, and there's coffee, if you prefer. I swear it's nothing weird. No mushrooms, no raw eggs and definitely no sausage water. It's just regular coffee, my favourite. And I'm even curious of your opinion if you decide to try it.

So... For how long have you two known each other?

You know, I think it's rather rude to treat the host with silence...

That's better. You think it's not my business, I respect that, there is communication, we're going in the right direction. Maybe there is something that actually is my business and you would like to talk about it?

Oh, I'm glad you've noticed, because I knew that at some point we would have to raise this topic. Yes, there are no windows here. What's more - no TV, no radio, no phones, no laptops. You don't need any of those at the moment. Think of this as a well earned rest for your brain. Going further - you won't find any sharp objects here. And if you find a way to escape or harm yourself with things you can find here - I'll be extremely impressed. Now, I have to confess something and I hope it will not affect your feelings in any way. So... (Sound of deep breath) You are not my first hostage. Please, don't look at me like this. Believe me, they meant nothing to me, in the end they were all just disappointments. But you and I... I think we have something special...

I'm saying this to all my hostages? (Honest laugh) Hahaha! Someone's getting feisty, I love that! But being serious - many have been kept here, none escaped. Nor alive or dead. But you are more than welcome to try. A good chase brings a lot of spice to a relationship, if I could call it that way.

I really don't know how long it will take. I'm planning to use you tonight and then we will see. Oh, God, you should really stop making those faces because it's just too tempting... The thing is I need to do something before that. You know, someone has to help the chaos to spread itself. So, you're staying here alone and you have to organise your time by yourself. There is a bookshelf and you'll find something interesting there for sure. Or you can try to escape, or I can put you back to sleep. The choice is yours. I will be back in a few hours and then we'll go out.

Yes, out. That's the big surprise - we're going on a date!

I mean exactly what I said. A date. You've never been on any?

So why are you so confused? We will eat a fancy dinner and I'll show you the city by night. You're in the capital! Didn't I say earlier that I will show you some interesting places? Besides, maybe that's the last date in your life? I promise to do my best. This will be the night you'll remember.

Oh, come on! Don't you find me attractive? 

Yeah, I know I kill people and blah blah blah, but I still remember when I first talked to you. You thought I was hitting on you and you were blushing so hard... Your eyes sparkled like stars when you looked at me, and when I said I will give you my number, your heart pounded so loud I could hear it. You are blushing even now! It was such fun to watch your excitement slowly turn into dread, when you realized who you've been talking to. But still - I think I am exactly your type. Look at me and say I'm wrong.

(Slightly vexed)

I said: look at me!

Did it sound like I gave you a choice? I know everything is nice, we're having fun, joking and stuff, but don't forget who I am. I can cause you so much pain, that you will go mad. And I don't even have to move my finger. Do you need a small reminder? You can scream all you want, nobody will hear you.

So, if you look at it this way, you indeed have a choice: we can go on a date or first it will hurt, a lot, and then we will go on a date. You have a few hours to think about it. Understood?

It's the last time I'm repeating myself: understood?

(Back with the normal voice)

Good. So... You may dress yourself up, there should be some fancy clothes in the closet. Or don't, this choice is yours too. This city has already seen everything. Ok, so I will be going now. Do you need another nap or will you behave?

I thought so. There is plenty of food, so you won't be hungry. I'll be back in a few hours.

(Speaker gets up from the table and slowly heads towards the door, but suddenly stops)

Oh, there is still one thing that bothers me. Through all this time, you didn't mention, not once, that he will find you. Is it because you know he won't, don't you? Without you he's just a dumb strapper. And all of his powers are useless, because he wouldn't even find his own ass, without you telling him where to seek for it. So there won't be any spectacular rescue… Together you are a perfect team, but separately - each of you is weak in their own way. Weak and powerless. So… Our situation here… Doesn't it mean a game over for the both of you?

You don't have to answer, your face shows everything. But don't worry, the fun part hasn't even started yet.

(Sound of opening the door)

Oh, and I don't really want to twist the knife in the wound, but if you hold on to the hope that he's dead worried about what has happened to you - you should know you wrote him a message, that you are tired and you need a few days off. So he probably thinks you are just sitting home and watching TV or reading books or whatever, because that's where your phone is. Am I right? And I'm really curious, when he will notice something is wrong. So... Have a nice day and I hope you are as excited for the evening as I am. Bye!

(Sound of closing the door and closing the locks)

1nnfm8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_dhani_sethia/comments/1nnfm8d/am_i_the_problem_or_my_parents/,Am I the problem or my parents?,"So I'm going to be sharing alot of personal information here anonymously. I wanted to before but I was scared someone would find out but I ah6ve to know now. I live in nagpur India wih my mother father and a 17 yr old sister. I myself am 14 yrs old female in class 10th while my sister is in 12th. I am not goin to sugar coat anything and will tell the reader everything. Basically since I was small me and my parents have been having problems and they have been accelerating continiously. The problem is that acc to my parents I am a spoiled brat who does not obey her parents amd does not respect them at all. They say I don't take punishment. Incidents happen very frequently. For example I was sleeping and I and to got to school. My father came to wake me up 2 times before. I had been in heavy sleep so I had Absolutely NO idea or sense. I was in deep sleep. The third time I heard him so I said yeah I'm waking up. It was getting a little late. For me it was the first time. So he stared shouting in my face to get up NOW in this tone and face that I can't explain but it is very scary. This is a petty incident but so many happen like this EVery single day where I am beaten that my respect for them automatically lessens. So I don't listen to them as much. I JUST CANT. I think about those incidents. Them kicking me with legs on the floor. It just makes my blood boil and I JUST CANT respect them like I probably should. I look at him with hatred so he says keep your eyes down don't answer back feel ashamed. When I don't he starts hitting me and kicking me. He says he has a right to do that and there is no law that forbids so in India. He says if I want a law like that I should go to norway or something. He says he can hit me and do whatever he wants till I'm 18 by law and after that morally also. I used to think hitting was wrong but on social media in india ir is considered normal so I don't know what to think. He has hitten me with stick on my legs also. Hitting is veryyyyyy common. My mother I know she loves me but she also believes in my father's way. They don't have a good relationship and fight alot but they believe both are awesome parents. My sister is my safe point but I broke when she once said I was also wrong I should respect them. I know used to but I just can't anymore. I cry many times in school and in my classes. I am very good at academics but they don't care. They say this is more important. I do self study so they don't prioritize my studies. My sister used to take full help from my father who is good at maths. So her studies were always important. Oh my god she's studying don't disturb her! She's in 10th not like you! Go away! But when I am in 10th... Don't disturb her she's in 12th preparing for jee so her studies are top most. When I say so they say yes it will always be like that because she is elder one. They say we have lost the excitement of being in 10th. But I am in 10th for the first  time why don't they understand! When I show something to my father or tell him I did this in school today he never says I'm proud of you or you did the right thing. It's always oh you didn't have to do that why did you do that. Huh! Waste of time! Fool! When is say I'm hurt they say I'm not taking feedback. Well am I so wrong that he never gets the chance to say so!? He will never open the doors. I have to get down to go to a class and he will follow only after 2 minutes even if he is ready. HE IS IN CHARGE! AUTHORITY! I am not allowed to spend my own earned money without permission. Never watched cartoons or tv. No junk food. Pocket money? What's that? Never played online games. Phone? Somehow use my sister's old phone temporarily without recharge so I can't call. I don't have net. There is no wifi at home. He says I shouldn't use perfume amd lip balm because this is my student life. He never buys any of us perfumes. I like collecting them it's my hobby like people collect stamps! I got a few from friends on bdays. I hide instagram games and this too from my parents. Me and my sister both have learned this. To hear footsteps and noises. He hit me today at the sleeping incident or whenever I'm late. Yes I'm a lil not punctual but is it that big of a crime. It's not as if I don't try! My sister is also not happy but she is the good child with awesome terms with her parents. I am the spoiled brat who they have to 'mend'. Mending me is more important than studies so my studies need to sacrificed my board exam doest matter in life. That's what they say. They said first to become a lawyer sarcastically saying I talk back alot. Then they say don't become because my arguments don't make sense. They say I'm overreacting and it's harmless jokes but they say it seriously too and it biases my ALOT. I try not to but still. I used to think I was right but now I fear to be wrong. I don't want to doubt myself! I'm insecure about my body amd my mother says I share with my sister more than her and complains. YES because she dosent Judge me! I won't go into details but I faced what female teens face about their body and she made me more insecure. I felt insecure about my chest she said I was a flat cucumber. She says it harmlessly not meaning it but it pains me. I never vape smoke never drank coffee or tea in my entire life. Never skipped school. Didn't have freinds till 8th. Found a lil group in 9th and 10th. Now my mother says I give them too much attention because I didn't have freinds before and they have just taken me in their group and they're not actually My friends. I don't know if they are ot not but I know that I feel happy too with them if sometimes sad....
I don't feel respected In my group. They consider me little. Nobody in my entire life NOT A SINGLE PEROSN IS THERE who prefers me as first priority. Nobody has had a crush on me EVER. My parents say I don't obey them and all. I don't know...it's not like I want to be the villain. I used to think I was right but I fear to be the problem. I don't want to doubt myself. Am I a spoiler brat? Pls tell me I'm not. My parents say she's gonna grow up and say we ""abused her"" sarcastically. They have a problem with My diary. They even read it saying it was a critical situation we needed to know what was going on we are your parents we have a right. 
I don't know hat to think.
I've began to hate my father. 
But I have good moments too with my family I know they love me and I do too so I'm confused as hell....
There is so much more but I can't write everything. I've stopped crying. I wait to turn 18. I BELIEVE I AM A GOOD PERSON. but if that was true why isn't there a single person who chooses me amd is not tied to me by blood. My freinds say I'm a good freind I take efforts....I really really hope someone answers I NEED TO KNOW PLS. Tell me if I'm doing something wrong I'll change it. I want to be the main character in a book. She's always a good Persons seh does wrong things but she's still loved and most imp LIKED. I want somebody to choose me after knowing everything about me without any compulsory option to choose me. Be It a freind or anyone. My freind harmlessly tease me saying the phrase I say anything And I ask wierd doubts to the teacher. Nobody notices me. They say I look at people in a creepy way. THATS MY EYEYS SHPULD I TAKE THEM OFF. I feel neglected but if it happens everywhere then I must be the problem....right? I want to be a good person. Am I? How bad can I be I'm just 14! I Fear that I gain sympathy amd seek attention from others. I feel guilty. I know use my periods as an exuse sometimes infront of my father so that atleast ONCE he respects what I say. He says there is no democracy but dictatorship in this house. When he is angry he drives fast amd scares me. He makes weird noises to contol his anger. My mother says I should go see a counselor due to my bad behavior. They say I just use big words and I fear if that's true. Things like trauma and all make me feel overreacting. Every time I feel like I'm just sympathizing with myself to put away that blame. Writing this just so I can convince myself I'm not a bastard. Yeah so wt is that wrong!? Am I just framing myself as an abused child ohhh my gooddd to put away my blame an all. I swear to God nothing I said is false here. I never go out with my freinds. Why because my behavior is bad. They say our parenting is The best in all. I should be grateful. I am grateful for having a good education amd the choice to choose my career. There are so manyyy things that make me feel like I'm actually a really bad person. Please! I don't want to be",1,1758524522.0,u_dhani_sethia,0,1.0,False
1nnfm64,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1nnfm64/the_red_diary/,The red diary,"THE RED DIARY

This pen that keeps alive the words and thoughts of the dead, this very pen that commands armies and guides the bullet from the gun—what did this pen do to me?

It was a winter day when Peter came home, his knuckles red from cold. He was a quiet person, someone who carried conversations in his head but never let them reach his lips. In his hands was a white bag. The bag found its place on the familiar table, beside the familiar chair that always reminded him of his father.

Peter lived in the hours when others slept. At one in the morning, he pulled from the bag a diary bound in red leather. The pen felt warm between his fingers, though his hands remained numb from winter. He pressed the tip to paper and began:

Today I turned twenty. It feels like yesterday I was ten.

A smile touched his lips, but it carried no joy.

In these twenty years, what have I done? What was the reason to live this long? What was the reason to endure? What was the purpose?

The questions stirred something restless in him. He left the chair, made coffee in the kitchen, and returned. When he looked at the empty chair again, something shifted in his mind. He sat down. His hands had grown warm, but now the pen felt cold.

Why do we need purpose or meaning? This chair doesn't ask such questions. It simply bears weight and endures. So why do I ask?

After writing these words, he stared at them with surprise. ""This is truth,"" he said to the empty room. ""I want to capture every moment in this diary. But sometimes I wonder if the diary is writing me instead.""

He lifted the coffee cup. Its bitterness gave him comfort, made him think of her.

I met Sophia in a cafe on a Tuesday afternoon. She sat alone at a corner table, reading a book whose title I never learned. When I asked if I could share her table, she looked up with eyes that seemed to hold some private sadness. ""Of course,"" she said, and moved her cup to make room for mine.

We didn't speak much that first day. I ordered coffee, she had tea. We sat in comfortable silence, two strangers finding peace in each other's presence. When she gathered her things to leave, she paused at my chair. ""Same time tomorrow?"" she asked. I nodded, not trusting my voice.

This became our ritual. Day after day, we met at the same table. Slowly, words began to pass between us. She told me about her work at the library, how she loved the smell of old books and the quiet whispers of people discovering stories. I told her about my nights, how darkness felt safer than daylight, how I wrote in a diary to make sense of the world.

""What do you write about?"" she asked one afternoon.

""Nothing important,"" I said. ""Just thoughts that have nowhere else to go.""

She smiled. ""Sometimes those are the most important thoughts of all.""

Weeks passed like this. We never touched, barely looked directly at each other, but something grew between us that felt both fragile and essential. When she laughed at something I said, the sound filled spaces in me I didn't know were empty. When she was quiet, I felt her silence like a weight I wanted to carry forever.

One evening, as autumn painted the cafe windows with early darkness, she said, ""I look forward to seeing you here. It's the best part of my day.""

I should have said the same. I should have told her that her presence made the world bearable, that her small smiles kept me tethered to something good. Instead, I just nodded and stared into my coffee.

That night I wrote: Do I love her? Or do I just need her? Is there a difference?

The next day brought rain. I wore my favorite coat—warm, comfortable, brown, and light. On my way to meet Sophia, I saw a child getting soaked, shivering as he walked. Without thinking, I gave him my umbrella. His face lit up with pure joy, the kind of happiness that exists before the world teaches you to doubt it.

I arrived at the cafe drenched and shivering. Sophia looked up from her book and gasped. ""You're completely wet! What happened?""

""I gave my umbrella to a child,"" I said.

She stared at me for a long moment. Then she stood, took off her scarf, and wrapped it around my shoulders. Her hands lingered there, warm against the cold fabric of my coat. ""You're a good person, Peter,"" she said quietly.

The scarf smelled like her perfume, something light and clean that made me think of spring mornings. For the first time, we sat closer than usual. I could feel the warmth radiating from her body, could see the small freckles on her cheek, could count her eyelashes if I dared.

""Can I ask you something?"" she said.

I nodded.

""Why are you so sad?""

The question hung between us like a bridge I was afraid to cross. ""I don't think I know how to be happy,"" I said finally.

""Maybe happiness isn't something you know how to be. Maybe it's something you choose to let in.""

That night I walked home in my heavy, wet coat. What had once felt light and comfortable now weighed me down with every step. Its beautiful brown color looked dirty when soaked. This coat, I realized, was like my heart—transformed by rain into something unrecognizable.

I wrote in my diary: She offered me her warmth and I took it. But what do I offer in return? What do I give her except my sadness and silence?

Days passed. I began to notice things about Sophia I had missed before. How she always ordered chamomile tea after three o'clock because caffeine kept her awake. How she bit her lower lip when concentrating on her book. How she saved the last sip of tea in her cup, as if she couldn't bear to finish it completely.

I noticed too how she looked at me—not just at my face, but deeper, as if she were reading something written in a language only she understood. It should have made me feel seen, understood. Instead, it filled me with terror.

One afternoon, she reached across the table and touched my hand. Her fingers were warm, soft, alive. ""Peter,"" she said, ""I care about you. I want you to know that.""

I should have turned my palm up, should have interlaced my fingers with hers, should have said that I cared about her too. Instead, I pulled my hand away as if her touch burned me.

""I'm sorry,"" I said, though I wasn't sure what I was apologizing for.

""You don't have to be sorry for feeling things,"" she said. But I saw something dim in her eyes, a small light going out.

That night I filled pages in my diary: Why did I pull away? Why do I destroy everything good before it can hurt me? She offered me her heart and I handed it back like something I couldn't afford.

The next time we met, she seemed different. She smiled when she saw me, but the smile didn't reach her eyes. We talked about small things—the weather, the books she was reading, the coffee shop's new pastries. But underneath our words lived a larger silence, growing like a tumor.

Finally, I couldn't bear it anymore.

""Sophia,"" I said, interrupting her mid-sentence about a novel she was enjoying. ""Do you really care about me? Or do you pity me?""

She set down her tea cup carefully, as if it were made of the most delicate glass. ""What do you mean?""

""I mean, when you look at me, do you see someone worth caring about? Or do you see someone broken who needs fixing?""

Her face went very still. For a long moment, she said nothing. When she finally spoke, her voice was quiet but steady.

""I see someone who is so afraid of being hurt that he hurts himself first. I see someone who asks questions designed to push people away and then wonders why he's alone.""

""That doesn't answer my question.""

""Yes, Peter. I care about you. Not because you're broken, not because I want to fix you, but because underneath all that fear, I see someone gentle and kind and worthy of love. But you don't see that, do you?""

I stared at her, this woman who had given me months of her afternoons, who had offered me her warmth without asking for anything in return. ""How can you be sure?""

""Because I know what it feels like to be afraid too,"" she said. ""I know what it's like to think you don't deserve good things. But caring about you isn't charity, Peter. It's a choice I make because you make my life better just by being in it.""

Tears gathered in the corners of her eyes, but she didn't let them fall.

""The question isn't whether I care about you. The question is whether you'll let yourself believe it.""

She reached for my hand again, and this time I didn't pull away. Her fingers were trembling slightly.

""I have to go,"" she said suddenly, though we had just sat down. ""I'm sorry. I just... I need to think.""

She gathered her things quickly, avoiding my eyes. At the door, she turned back once. ""I hope you find what you're looking for, Peter. I really do.""

After she left, I sat alone at our table for three hours. I ordered coffee after coffee until my hands shook from caffeine. I stared at the chair where she had sat, at the tea cup she had left half-empty, at the book she had forgotten in her hurry to leave.

That night I wrote: I asked her if she cared about me and she told me yes. She told me I was worthy of love. So why does it feel like I just lost everything?

Days passed. Weeks. I went to the cafe every afternoon at our usual time, but she never came. I asked the barista if he had seen her. ""The lady with the book? No, not for a while now. She used to come every day with you.""

Used to. Past tense. Finished.

I began writing different words in my diary: You are not worthy of love. Whoever loves you, you consume them too. You are not worthy of love.

After this, I started hating mirrors. I broke the one near my writing table. I couldn't stand to see the face that had driven away the only person who had ever looked at it with kindness.

Maybe I no longer feel sadness or happiness. Maybe I just exist, like this chair, bearing weight without question. The days passed, and Peter remembered only basic things—eating when hungry, sleeping when tired, existing because stopping seemed like more effort than continuing.

In his mind, a judge appeared who kept careful record of his failures. Every harsh word he hadn't spoken but had thought. Every kindness offered that he had refused. Every chance at happiness he had sabotaged.

One evening, Peter climbed onto a bridge. The water below looked peaceful, final. Two voices spoke in his mind:

""Jump. Your test is over. You failed anyway.""

""You have no right to choose. You cannot choose of your own free will. Even this would be a betrayal of what you owe to those who tried to love you.""

Peter didn't jump. But he didn't climb down either. He stood there until dawn, until the choice was taken from him by the simple fact of other people crossing the bridge, of life continuing around him whether he participated or not.

Years passed like pages turning in a book no one was reading. At thirty, Peter wrote: Adulthood is not growth. It is learning to die slowly while pretending to live.

In his forties, he composed a letter to Sophia that he never sent: You were real. Too real. You were my chance to learn what love felt like, and I gave that chance a person's name—your name. I wasn't afraid of you. I was afraid of how much I wanted to deserve you.

Peter grew old. One day he found himself in a room with no mirrors, sitting in a chair that reminded him of the one in his childhood home. A doctor sat across from him, holding something red and leather-bound.

""How long have you been here?"" the doctor asked.

Peter smiled. It was the first genuine smile he had managed in decades. ""My whole life.""

The doctor opened the red diary. ""I've been reading this. Your journal. But there's something I don't understand. You stopped writing entries after you turned twenty-five. The pages after that are blank. Why did you stop?""

Peter looked at the diary, at the doctor, at the room with no mirrors where he could finally exist without seeing himself.

""Who,"" he asked quietly, ""was writing me all this time, then?""

The doctor looked confused. Peter's smile widened. For the first time in his life, he had asked a question that someone else couldn't answer.

Outside, it began to rain. Somewhere in the city, a child was getting wet. Somewhere else, a woman was drinking tea alone at a table for two. And in a room without mirrors, an old man finally understood that the most important stories are the ones we tell ourselves about who we are.

The red diary lay open between them, its pages filled with a life that may or may not have belonged to the man who held the pen. In the end, it didn't matter who had written what. What mattered was that the story existed, that someone had cared enough to put words to paper, to try to make sense of the beautiful, terrible mystery of being human.

The rain continued. The story ended. The questions remained.",0,1758524516.0,FictionWriting,0,0.5,False

Again. My mornings used to be my sanctuary, a quiet hour before the city truly woke up, but for the past month, they'd become a daily exercise in suppressing rage. It wasn't just coffee, though, was it? It was the principle. Every single morning, without fail, the counter next to our ancient drip machine was a graveyard of dark, gritty evidence that someone (read: Maya) had made their coffee and then, apparently, vanished into thin air without a glance back.\n\nI tried to be chill, honestly, but a part of me was lowkey fuming. I'd clean it, *again*, wiping away the evidence with a passive-aggressive sigh, hoping the sheer force of my martyrdom would somehow telepathically shame the culprit. It never did. This particular Tuesday, though, was different. I walked into the kitchen, already bracing myself, and there it was: not just a sprinkle, but a *mound*. Like, an entire teaspoon's worth of grounds had exploded onto the white counter, right next to a half-eaten bagel and a sticky spoon. My blood pressure, like, *actually* rose. I just stood there, staring at the chaos, and then I just... walked away. I couldn't even.\n\nThat evening, I was about to text my mom asking to move back home when Liam, our resident chill dude, found me sulking on the couch. He’d seen the coffee grounds too, I guess, because he just sighed and said, \""Okay, we seriously need to talk about the kitchen situation.\"" Maya, ever the creative type, emerged from her room, paintbrush in hand, looking genuinely confused. \""What kitchen situation?\"" she asked, oblivious. That’s when I finally unloaded, probably a little too aggressively, about the coffee grounds, the dirty dishes, the whole nine yards. Ngl, it felt good to finally say it out loud.\n\nLiam, ever the peacemaker, suggested we actually, you know, *talk* it out, rather than let the passive-aggressive vibes fester. Maya, to her credit, admitted she just gets so engrossed in her art or whatever she’s doing and then rushes out the door, totally forgetting. She was lowkey embarrassed, explaining she just never noticed how bad it was. Liam, being the tech-savvy one, found this app for shared chores and expenses. We decided to try it, assigning specific daily and weekly tasks. Honestly, I was skeptical at first, thinking it’d just be another thing to ignore, but the visual accountability really worked.\n\nNow, the kitchen is generally spotless. Seriously. We even started doing dinner together once a week, and it’s kinda become my favorite night. It’s wild how a few spilled coffee grounds almost blew up our peace, but honestly, it kinda brought us closer. We learned to communicate before resentment built, and now our apartment actually feels like a home, not just a pit stop.\n\nLiving with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace.

1nnfk72,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nnfk72,Finally tried a roller mop robot - Dreame Aqua 10 Ultra thoughts,"
So I've been putting off upgrading from my old Ecovacs for like 2 years because honestly, it still works fine and I'm cheap. But I kept seeing people rave about roller mops vs the spinning pad style, and curiosity got the better of me. Picked up the Dreame Aqua 10 Ultra on sale (thank god for sales because this thing ain't cheap).

My setup: 550 sq ft apartment, mostly different tiles (went for variety to keep things interesting), a few area rugs, no pets because I can barely take care of myself.

**What I'm actually loving:**
- This thing has some serious weight to it. Feels solid, not like those flimsy plastic models. Makes me think of old German appliances that last forever
- Setup was painless through the app, unlike my Ecovacs which took 3 attempts and a YouTube tutorial
- Mapping was crazy quiet. I was expecting the usual laser disco but barely heard it working
- The roller mop is legit different. It actually stays wet during cleaning (they call it AquaRoll or something) and doesn't leave those gross streaky marks my old robot used to. Plus there's this AutoSeal thing that covers the roller when it hits my rugs so they don't get soaked
- 30,000Pa suction is no joke - picks up stuff I didn't even know was there
- Auto-empty is clutch for a lazy person like me
 - The roller mop is legit different. It actually stays wet and clean during cleaning (they call it AquaRoll or something) and doesn't leave those gross streaky marks my old robot used to. Plus there's this AutoSeal thing that covers the roller when it hits my rugs so they don't get soaked
- Edge cleaning is better with the extending brush and mop thingy, but it still misses some tight corners near my radiator
-The brush is quite smart as I didn’t notice any hair entangled as it cleans
-It moves around effortlessly over little bumps on the floor thanks to its hexalift 6d elevation upgrade 

**The annoying stuff:**
- When it's on turbo mode, it's definitely louder than my old Ecovacs, but honestly not terrible for the cleaning power you get
- The station takes foreverrrr to wash that roller. We're talking 15+ minutes sometimes with the hot water cleaning cycle. I get that the 100°C cleaning is thorough but damn, I could hand wash my dishes faster
- Speaking of hot water - why does it take so long to heat up? My coffee maker is faster
- The thing is heavy enough that I actually have to think about where I put it. Can't just toss it around like the old one
- Edge cleaning is better with the extending brush thingy, but it still misses some tight corners near my radiator

**Random observations:**
- It does look sleeker than my chunky old Ecovacs, actually complements my space nicely
- The app is packed with features - like, they really crammed everything they could think of in there. Takes some exploring to find what you actually need
- Battery life is solid but the charging dock is massive. People with small apartments be ware.
- The roller really does stay cleaner during use - no more gross dirty water trails

Overall it's a solid upgrade, and the roller mop thing isn't just marketing hype - actually works better on my tile floors than spinning pads ever did.

Anyone else dealing with the long cleaning cycles on these newer models? Worth it for the thorough clean or just overkill for small spaces?",9,1758524317.0,RobotVacuums,7,1.0,False

We’re at **4.9k members** and just **one dosae flip away from 5,000**! 🎉

To celebrate, we’ve decided to do something bold. Something historic. Something the BJP hasn't managed to do since 2021...

**A full-on South India subreddit census.**  
And yes – it’ll happen **before the BJP gets around to theirs.**

# What’s the Plan?

Once we hit 5K, we’re rolling out a **community-wide census** – to find out:

* Where you're from (TN, KA, KL, AP, TS – or one of those Chennai boys who says ""from Bangalore"" on Tinder)
* What languages you speak (bonus points if you speak more than your CM 👀)
* Age, profession, dosae thickness preferences, coffee vs tea wars, and moreeeee....

All **anonymous**, **fun**, and **zero judgment** (unless you say butter chicken is better than ghee roast – in which case, we need to talk).

# What It’s NOT:

* It’s not the ITR, don’t worry. We’re not like **Nirmala Tai** – we won’t ask for your PAN, Aadhaar, or your soul in exchange for a refund 😤
* No OTPs, no linking bank accounts. Just pure community fun.

# What You Can Do:

* **Help us hit 5K**: share the sub, tell your cousins, post on your Insta stories like it’s your marriage invite
* **Participate** when the census drops – takes 2 minutes, gives lifetime bragging rights
* Non south indians are allowed to take this survey too, only if youre an active user.

Let’s make this the **most South Indian census** the internet has ever seen – full of stats, sass, and sambhar.

The blue glow of the TV washed over me in the darkness. I sank deeper into the couch, one hand rubbing my swollen belly. On screen, a reporter stood at Moon pack's borders, detailing the latest security measures. Pack warriors moved in the background, but the one face I was searching for wasn't there.



Where was Damon?



I checked my phone: 12:04 AM. My back ached from sitting too long, and the baby had been unusually active tonight, kicking and rolling as if she could sense my unease. Seven months pregnant, and I was still waiting up for my mate like some lovesick teenager.



""He said he'd be back by ten,"" I whispered to my belly. ""Daddy had to settle a dispute at the borders, that's all.""



The baby kicked in response, a sharp jab just beneath my ribs. Almost like she was calling me on my lie.



The words sounded hollow, even to me. The knot in my chest had been growing for weeks now—that unmistakable twinge that came with the mate bond. Something wasn't right.



I shifted position, trying to get comfortable, when a sharp pain shot through my lower abdomen. I gasped, clutching the armrest.



""No, no, no...""



I'd had Braxton Hicks before, but this was different. My fingers trembled as I tried to steady my breathing. Another cramp hit me, stronger this time, doubling me over.



This is too early. Something's wrong.



I knew what was happening. The mate bond was supposed to be sacred, protective, especially during pregnancy. But when one mate betrayed that trust...



My eyes twitched with the effort of holding back tears as I fumbled for my phone. I reached for our mind link first, a desperate attempt to connect to Damon.



Damon, I need you. The baby—something's happening.



Nothing. Just the static emptiness of being blocked out. My throat tightened with the realization. He wasn't just absent; he'd deliberately shut me out.



Fine. There was still the phone. I grabbed it from the side table, my hands shaking so badly I had to try twice to unlock it. I pulled up Damon's contact—his smiling face from happier times staring back at me as I pressed call.



One ring. I shifted, trying to find a position that didn't hurt.



Two rings. Another contraction built, making me bite my lip to keep from crying out.



Three rings. ""Please pick up, please pick up...""



Four—



""What?"" Damon's voice cut through, sharp and annoyed.



My heart leapt at the sound of him, despite everything. But I could hear music in the background. Laughter. The clink of glasses. No sounds of a border dispute, that was for sure.



""Damon,"" I gasped, fighting through the pain. ""Something's wrong with the baby. My water broke. I think—""



""I already told you where I am, now can you let me be?!"" His voice crackled with irritation. I could practically see him rolling his eyes, the way he did lately whenever I spoke.



""Damon, please—I need help—"" But all I heard was the beep of the call ending.



I stared at the phone in disbelief, the screen going dark. Had he really just hung up on me? While I was in labor with his child?



I called back immediately, heart hammering against my ribs.



Straight to voicemail.



I tried again. Voicemail.



And again. And again. And again.



By the fifth attempt, I was sobbing, leaving a message that was probably unintelligible through my tears. ""Please come home. The baby's coming. I'm scared.""



Warm liquid trickled down my thighs, soaking into the couch beneath me. My water had broken. The panic rose in my chest like a tide, threatening to drown me.



Another contraction hit, stronger than before. The pain wasn't just in my belly anymore—it radiated through my chest, my heart, my soul. This wasn't supposed to happen. Not like this.



Tears spilled down my cheeks as I struggled to stand. My legs shook beneath me, barely supporting my weight. I needed to get to the bedroom, to the overnight bag I'd packed just in case. Even though it wasn't supposed to be needed for another two months.



The contraction ebbed, giving me a moment's reprieve. I staggered forward, one hand pressed against my stomach, the other reaching out for support. The hallway seemed to stretch endlessly before me, the bedroom door impossibly far.



Another wave hit, this one stealing my breath entirely. My knees buckled. I caught myself against the wall, my vision swimming with black spots.



So this was how it would end. My baby born too soon because her father couldn't keep his promises. Me, alone on the floor of our home, the mate bond twisting like a knife in my chest.



As the pain subsided again, I heard the back door open. Heavy footsteps approached from the kitchen.



""Miss Evelyn?""



Luis, our gardener. What was he doing here so late?



""Miss Evelyn!"" His weathered face appeared in my narrowing vision, eyes widening as he took in the scene. ""The baby—""



""Help me,"" I managed to whisper. ""Please.""



His calloused hands were surprisingly gentle as he helped me to my feet. ""Hospital. Now,"" he said firmly, already guiding me toward the door.



My last thought before another contraction claimed me was that my mate should have been the one holding me now. Not our gardener. Not a near-stranger who had more concern in his eyes than Damon had shown in months.



Chapter 2



Evelyn



The hospital room was too bright, too sterile. I lay in bed, exhausted beyond words, staring at the ceiling tiles. Twelve hours of labor. Twelve hours of fighting to bring my daughter safely into this world, two months before she was ready.



The door opened, and I tensed, turning my head with effort.



Damon walked in, still wearing yesterday's clothes. His tie hung loose around his neck, his hair disheveled. And there, on his collar—a smudge of pink lipstick that might as well have been written in blood.



My stomach knotted at the sight. He hadn't even bothered to change. Or to shower. Or to hide the evidence.



He stopped at the foot of my bed, hands in his pockets, keeping his distance like I was contagious.



""I heard you gave birth this morning,"" he said, his voice flat. ""Congratulations.""



That single word hung in the air between us. Congratulations. As if I'd just aced an exam or won a small lottery. Not like I'd spent half a day fighting for our baby's life while he was somewhere else. With someone else.



""Where have you been?"" I asked. My voice came out as a raspy whisper after hours of screaming through contractions. ""I could have died if it weren't for Luis.""



He blinked. ""Luis?""



""The gardener,"" I clarified. ""He's the one who brought me to the hospital. He's the one who stayed until they took me into delivery.""



Damon shifted his weight from one foot to the other, almost looking uncomfortable for a split second. But he didn't answer my question. Didn't explain why he'd ignored my calls all night. Didn't even ask about his own daughter.



""I had a freaking premature birth,"" I said, each word sharper than the last, ""all because I'm marked by a cheating mate..."" My voice broke, tears spilling down my cheeks. ""And all you can say is congratulations?""



Something flashed in his eyes—anger, maybe, or just annoyance at being inconvenienced by my emotions.



""I have no time to exchange words with you, Evelyn."" He straightened his tie, a gesture so normal it felt wrong in the middle of all this.



And just like that, he turned and walked away. As if I were nothing. As if our daughter were nothing.



I closed my eyes, letting the tears fall freely now. I'd known our marriage was in trouble. I'd felt his growing distance, seen the signs. But I never thought he'd abandon us when we needed him most. That wound would never fully heal, I knew. Some betrayals cut too deep.



A soft knock at the door interrupted my thoughts. A nurse stood there, a tiny bundle swaddled in her arms.



""Someone's been missing her mama,"" she said softly.



As she placed my daughter in my arms, something warm stirred inside my cold, broken heart. She was so small, so fragile, her skin almost see-through. But she was fighting. Her tiny chest rose and fell with determined breaths, her miniature fingers curled into defiant fists.



""Hello, little one,"" I whispered, tracing the curve of her cheek with my finger. For a moment, the ache in my heart subsided, replaced by something fiercer, more powerful. I would protect her. I would give her the love her father couldn't.



It was a sad thing, to be born into a home with a father like Damon. But she would have me. And somehow, that would have to be enough.



Chapter 3



Evelyn



""It was the gardener who took me to the hospital."" The words felt strange coming out of my mouth. I stared at the thin hospital blanket covering my legs, picking at a loose thread. ""Luis. The guy who mows our lawn.""



Susan sat in the chair beside my bed, her hair pulled back in a messy ponytail. She'd come straight from work, still wearing her scrubs with the little cartoon frogs on them.



""When I couldn't reach Damon..."" I trailed off, not sure how to explain the fear of that moment. The panic. The pain.



Susan reached over and squeezed my hand. ""Hey, it's okay."" Her voice was steady, the same voice she'd used when we'd hide under blankets during thunderstorms as kids, sharing a flashlight and making up stories to drown out the thunder. ""You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.""



But I did want to. I needed to. The words had been building up inside me since yesterday, threatening to choke me if I didn't let them out.



""He hung up on me, Sus."" My voice was quiet. ""I told him something was wrong, that the baby was coming, and he hung up. Then he wouldn't answer.""



Susan's eyebrows pulled together. ""Are you sure he understood what you were saying? Maybe there was bad reception, or—""



""He understood."" I swallowed hard. ""And then he showed up this morning with lipstick on his collar. Didn't even ask about the baby. Just said 'congratulations' like I'd won a raffle or something.""



The bassinet next to us made a small noise as the baby—my daughter—shifted in her sleep. So tiny she barely took up any space in there. Her little chest rising and falling with breaths that seemed too fragile to sustain life.



Susan followed my gaze to the bassinet but quickly looked away. ""I'm sorry about the landline,"" she said, changing the subject. ""It's been acting up all week. And I had this awful migraine yesterday, couldn't even look at my phone without feeling sick."" She touched my arm. ""If I'd known...""



""It's not your fault."" I gave her a tired smile. ""You're here now.""



Susan nodded, looking relieved. She glanced at her watch. ""Mom and Dad send their love. They'll come by tomorrow—Dad's got that meeting with his publisher today.""



Of course. Our parents were always busy with something. Dad with his books, Mom with her charity work. Susan and I had practically raised each other.



""Does she have a name yet?"" Susan gestured vaguely toward the bassinet, still not looking directly at it.



""Ava,"" I said. ""I was thinking Ava Rose.""



""Pretty."" Susan fiddled with the strap of her purse. ""Has Damon seen her?""



""No."" The word came out sharper than I intended. ""He left before the nurse brought her in. Honestly, I don't think he even wants to see her.""



Susan's expression was hard to read. ""Things have been bad between you two for a while now, haven't they?""



I nodded, memories flashing through my mind: dinner tables with only one place set, nights waiting up for him only to fall asleep alone, the growing distance I couldn't seem to bridge no matter what I tried.



""I think he's cheating on me,"" I said finally. The words didn't hurt as much as I expected. Maybe because I'd known it for months, felt it in the mate bond that once connected us but now felt stretched thin and frayed. ""I can feel it... here."" I touched my chest, just over my heart. ""But I don't know who it is.""



Something flickered in Susan's eyes, there and gone too fast to catch. She shifted in her seat, her hand slipping from mine.



""You want me to find out?"" she asked, her voice controlled.



""Would you?"" I leaned forward, desperate for any help, any ally in this mess my life had become. ""You've always been good at getting people to talk. Maybe you could...""



""I'll handle it,"" Susan said, cutting me off. She stood abruptly, smoothing down her scrubs. ""But Evelyn, you need to prepare yourself. Confronting a cheating mate rarely ends well."" She didn't quite meet my eyes. ""Let me talk to him first, okay? Maybe I can get through to him.""



Relief flooded through me. ""Thank you,"" I said, reaching for her hand again. ""I don't know what I'd do without you.""



Susan squeezed my fingers, but it felt mechanical, like she was going through the motions. ""I should go. Early shift tomorrow.""



""Already? But you just got here.""



""I'll come back tomorrow, I promise."" She gathered her things, pausing at the door. ""Try to get some rest. You look exhausted.""



Before I could respond, she was gone, the door clicking shut behind her.



The room felt emptier, quieter without her. Outside the window, afternoon was sliding into evening, long shadows stretching across the hospital parking lot. I could see people going about their normal lives, getting into cars, heading home to families who were waiting for them.



Ava made a small sound, and I turned to look at her, really look at her for the first time since the nurses had cleaned her up and placed her in my arms. She had my nose, I thought. Maybe Damon's chin. Her skin was still wrinkled and red, her eyes unfocused when they opened briefly.



Would he ever look at her? Would he ever hold her and feel that rush of love I'd felt, even through the haze of pain and exhaustion?



I touched my stomach, still swollen and tender. Everything hurt—my body, my heart, my pride. But looking at Ava, I felt something else too. Something stronger than the pain.



""We'll be okay,"" I whispered to her, not entirely sure I believed it.



I got used to the 3 AM quiet. The particular stillness of the house when everyone else was asleep and it was just me and Ava in the yellow glow of her nursery lamp. Her tiny fingers would curl around mine while she nursed, and I'd watch shadows play across the ceiling, wondering where Damon was sleeping.



He came home less and less. When he did appear, it was only to shower and grab fresh clothes before disappearing again. One evening, I found him standing in the doorway of the nursery I'd spent months decorating—the clouds I'd painted on the ceiling, the bookshelf filled with stories I remembered from childhood. He looked at it all like he was seeing a stranger's house, then silently moved his remaining things to the guest room down the hall.



I tried to talk to him once, catching him in the kitchen early one morning.



""She has your eyes,"" I said, watching him pour coffee into a travel mug.



He stared at me for a long moment, then screwed the lid on his mug and walked out without responding.



Susan visited every few days, bringing takeout and watching bad reality TV with me while Ava slept. She never mentioned Damon, and I stopped asking if she'd talked to him. The answer was in the growing distance between us, in the cold silences that filled our home.



I was changing Ava one morning when my phone buzzed with a text.



Need Q3 projections for board meeting. Bring to office ASAP. - Marissa (That was Damon's assistant)



I stared at the message, my pulse quickening. This was the first real connection to Damon in weeks—even if it was through his assistant.



""What do you think, Ava?"" I asked, tickling her belly. ""Should we go see Daddy at his office?""



She blinked at me, uncomprehending but beautiful.



Twenty minutes later, I'd found the folder in his home office and was heading to the kitchen, an idea forming. The chicken porridge I'd made yesterday was still in the fridge—his favorite. I packed a container carefully, adding a sprig of parsley the way he liked.



""Maybe this is our chance,"" I told Ava as I strapped her into her carrier. ""Maybe seeing you, seeing us... maybe it will remind him of what's important.""



The hope was small, fragile, probably foolish. But it was all I had left to hold onto.



Chapter 4



Evelyn



Outside Damon's office building, the late morning sun turned the glass façade into a wall of fire. I stood on the sidewalk, Ava's carrier heavy in one hand, the bag with his documents and food in the other, wondering if I'd made a mistake coming here.



This is ridiculous. I'm his mate and the mother of his child. I shouldn't be afraid to walk into his office.



But my heart hammered against my ribs anyway, a trapped bird beating against its cage.



The security guard at the front desk recognized me, his eyes brightening. ""Luna Evelyn! It's been weeks."" His gaze dropped to the carrier, and his smile widened. ""And this must be the little one.""



""Yes, this is Ava,"" I said, grateful for the warmth in his voice after weeks of Damon's cold silence.



""The Alpha will be pleased to see you both,"" he said, buzzing me through.



Will he, though? I wondered, stepping into the elevator. I caught my reflection in the mirrored wall—dark circles under my eyes, hair pulled back in a hasty ponytail, wearing the first clean shirt I could find. Not exactly the put-together Luna I used to be.



As the elevator climbed, I rehearsed what I would say. I know things have been difficult between us. I want us to talk. Really talk. For Ava's sake, if nothing else.



Simple. Direct. No accusations, no tears.



The elevator doors slid open on the top floor. The familiar corridor stretched before me, lined with artwork from local pack artists—Damon's way of supporting the community. I'd helped him select most of these pieces, back when he still valued my opinion.



His assistant Marissa wasn't at her desk. Unusual for her to be away, but it made things easier.



I shifted Ava's carrier to my other hand and approached Damon's office door. Through the frosted glass, I could make out shadowy movements. He was there, and he wasn't alone. Probably in a meeting.



I hesitated, then raised my hand to knock. The porridge would be getting cold.



Knock first, I reminded myself. Don't just barge in.



My knuckles rapped against the wood, three quick taps. Without waiting for a response—a habit from years of coming and going freely in his spaces—I pushed the door open.



For one suspended moment, my brain couldn't process what I was seeing. Like looking at a painting that appeared to be one thing from a distance, only to discover it was something else entirely up close.



Damon was there, yes. But he wasn't in a meeting.



He stood with his back against his desk, his shirt half-unbuttoned. And wrapped around him, her legs straddling his thigh, her hands in his hair, was a woman. They broke apart at the sound of the door, two pairs of startled eyes turning toward me.



The flask of porridge slipped from my fingers. It hit the floor with a dull thud, the lid popping off, hot food spilling across the polished hardwood.



But I barely noticed. Because the woman disentangling herself from my mate, smoothing down her skirt with practiced ease, was Susan.



My sister.



The same sister who had held my hand in the hospital. Who had promised to help me. Who had looked me in the eyes and lied.



""Why?"" The word escaped me, small and broken.



Susan didn't answer. She didn't even have the decency to look ashamed. Instead, she stepped away from Damon, her chin lifting slightly, her eyes meeting mine with an emotion I couldn't name. Something cold and foreign that had no place in my sister's face.



I turned to Damon, searching. Regret or apology. Anything that would make sense of this nightmare.



In front of me, Damon's hands settled on Susan's waist, casual and possessive, as if I weren't even there. As if I hadn't just caught them in the act of betraying me in the most intimate way possible.



Susan's lips curved into something close to a smile.



My heart wasn't breaking. Breaking implied a quick, clean snap. This was a slow, excruciating compression, like being crushed from the inside out.



""How..."" I swallowed, my mouth dry. ""How long has this been going on?""



Damon shrugged, his eyes cold. ""What does it matter? I really just don't love you anymore.""



The words hit me so hard, I stumbled back a step.



""But I'm your fated mate,"" I whispered. ""Remember when you marked me?"" The night he'd claimed me, promised me forever. The first man I'd ever been with, the only man I'd ever wanted.



Something flickered in his eyes—a shadow of the man I'd fallen in love with, perhaps. But it was gone in an instant, replaced by a hardness I'd never seen before.



""You can stop whatever games you're playing now and go away with that monster of yours!"" he spat, his voice rising. ""We both know that child isn't mine.""

I(30M) liked this girl(28F) from my workplace, different departments. I know, you should not date in your workplace etc etc, its easier said than done. Anyways, long-story-short, I proposed her and she rejected me in the worst way possible. Its okay, life goes on. I found someone else, we dated for like 1.5 years and then had to walk away from her because she cheated. Been almost 3 month, single life was going good until I crossed paths with the previous girl again at a coffee shop.  
Detour,one thing I have noticed in my life till date for a guy usually is that when we break-up,its helps to move on faster if we start talking to new people as soon as possible. Unlike girls,most boys don't get showered with attention without asking.   
Back to the story, I talked with her,had a good time. We kept talking on text also. But here is where things fall flat,out of nowhere,she bought up about the last time we meet and how she misbehaved with me without any proper reason and I said ""Its okay, whatever happened happened. We both acted immaturely.""  
We again met some days later,this time I told her about my ex-gf and she immediately asked if she is just a rebound.I said no,but I can understand where she is coming from as the last break-up was very fresh. Then we talked about her ex-bf and other stuff and then I dropped her home and things looked good. Then something changed.I noticed ,her texting pattern(past trauma maybe),it was weird. She did the same things last time also when I approached her. Sometimes,it take 2-3 hours to reply , sometimes more, sometime very instant. I know its not indicative of anything as people have lives of their own and with us just started to talk.  
But here is this weird part, sometimes I don't get any reply but I see her putting up WhatsApp stories and all.  
One Day, I asked out for a proper DATE. But she rejected, saying that there was family function that day. It was okay we kept texting as usual.  
Then somedays later one night around 10pm,I asked if I can call her?(I am not a very good texter),she didn't reply and said next day that she slept early. I said, its okay. Then the very next day,I again asked if I call her? This time much earlier and she replied like around 3 hours later saying,sorry was watching a movie but she will sleep now(no mention of any rescheduling of call or anything). I said, okay and wished her good night and she replied back same and that's it. Till now,haven't talked to her. Recently she did liked whatssap story of mine, but I didn't react on it.   
I am confused, have I made the right decision by taking a standing as my efforts were not reciprocated even a little bit? Like picking up a phone call is most safest thing she can do is what I feel ,if after that she feels like talking never to talk to me I can understand.

I was comfortable with the idea of being aro. However, I have always been very active .. in the other end. 

3 months ago I met a guy, from Grindr actually. But I did not message with the intent that is usually behind a Grindr message. I liked his Bio, and he lived 1km away, practically my neighbour here in Norway. He seemed cool and I thought we could be good friends. We met up soon after as we seemed to get along well over text, and after meeting him. Oh boy has that been a roller coaster. We immediately hit it off, both being autistic and all. And after hanging out at a hardware store, discussing what brand of equipment we gravitated towards and why, we went back to my place and just sat outside on my porch talking for 3 hours while drinking coffee. 

Me being me it didn't take me long before I asked if he was open to going to bed with me, he accepted, and I thought sweet. I've had friends with benefits before. But almost from the start I have just felt differently about him. My chest always gives a pleasant squeeze when I see him, and getting a message from me always brightens up my day. I love being in his presence, and it really helps grounding me. I have even stopped seeing other people, the very idea being mildly disgusting now. 

But is this love? I've never liked the idea of a relationship, but i really want him in my life, and he feels the same way. I also know if we were to enter a relationship, nothing would HAVE to change aside from our labels, as I have already cut out sexual contact with other people and he only ever had me from meeting me. I just, what does love even feel like? Am I not aro anymore? All of these new feelings are scaring me and I don't know what to do with them. Reddit help 🙏",1,1758523600.0,aromantic,1,0.99,False
1nnfd4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_readytobloomwithoutu/comments/1nnfd4q/dreams_and_nightmares/,Dreams and Nightmares,"You promised me a life —
a world of you and me, nature and dreams.
Year after year, move after move, we stayed one.
You worked so hard and built that life.
I loved the man I woke up to.
You brought me coffee, kissed my head.
Do you remember that when your fist landed
where your gentle kisses used to fall?

Vacation — I leaned into you with tears and for a moment
I felt seen. I told you I was grateful.
That island felt like safety.
I believed we could walk through life hand in hand.
I never gave up.

Then something died.
I miss that man who whistled down the mountain street.
You made me feel beautiful — confident, held, mine.
You built me up, and I loved it.
Then you cut me down.

You promised to protect me.
Instead your hands left bruises,
splintered my ribs,
stole the air from my lungs.
I remember your eyes turning black.
I remember things hitting the back of my head without warning.
I remember the tightness in my chest and the fear that I might die.

I stayed because I loved you.
Because I loved our family more than I loved my own safety.
I did anything — everything — to keep you whole.
And when I needed you, you left me empty.

You lied to our friends about my bruises.
You ripped my sweatshirts from my shaking body,
tossed me like a ragdoll, and walked on.
You made me small. No voice. No opinion.
Everything I said was wrong. Everything I did was stupid.
You made me a problem to erase.

I remember the look of disgust when a bone pushed through my skin —
the shrug, the sigh: “You’re fine.”
I remember being shattered on the floor, looking at you for help,
and getting nothing but disgust.
I remember the months I unraveled after that, burying the pain
so you could have your peace while I suffered.

I remember the night you left us — thirteen hours from home, no money,
gunshots outside, our son’s scared face.
You failed us that night. You failed our family.
That was when I said, no more.

You made me into someone you could hate
so you wouldn’t have to look at yourself.
You blamed me. You humiliated me. You lied about me.
You imploded our vows to keep from being accountable.

I begged you to stop. I begged you to see me.
You turned my pain into my shame.
You broke me, then told me it was my fault.
And still I tried — hiding bruises under sleeves, aching from your rage, trying to save you while my safety was a joke.

No more.

I will not let your violence define me.
I will not carry your shame.
I am done being your victim.
Our home is calm now. Peaceful. We are thriving without you.

This is the end.
Goodbye.
Not with love, not with longing —
but with finality.
You lost me the moment your hands turned cruel.
You will never have me again.",1,1758523597.0,u_readytobloomwithoutu,0,1.0,False

1nnfbds,https://www.reddit.com/r/Devilcorp/comments/1nnfbds/base_pay_nightmare_schedule_no_at_costco/,"""Base Pay"", Nightmare Schedule, No $$ at Costco","This was my third (DC), and to be honest, I was bored. I knew what I was getting into—mostly. I had never been inside a Costco before, so I figured, why not apply and basically live there for a week? Nothing like 70 hours of Costco. There were definitely better ways to get that experience.

​But....I wasn't looking for a membership or a gift card, just the experience. From what I'd heard, Costco seemed like a cool place to shop and work.

​So, I went through two interviews and got the job. I would have been offended if I hadn't; this would have been my fourth DC. I think I just didn't seem desperate enough for the job I interviewed at right before this one.

​The ""training"" was supposedly around six months, and then you'd be able to make your own schedule, not go out into the field, and run your own office. You even got to pick where you wanted your office to be. You didn't even have to move. Yeah, sure.
​When I pulled up to the office, this is what I found:

​It was empty. (The surrounding offices in the building were stunning though)

​- The people were honest, kind-hearted, and not cut out for sales. (Excluding the boss and team leads)
​- There were promises that office upgrades were coming soon.
- ​The employees were young people and recent graduates.
- ​Most people didn't seem to understand what they'd signed up for.
​- A few wore oversized suits.
- ​Kids had moved states and cities to get there, thinking there was a real future for them.

​I was really curious about the base pay. Some DCs have none, but the commissions are high. I'm talking about working 15 hours a week and chilling out for the rest.(If only that were allowed) Other places claim ""base pay,"" but it's just a non-recoverable draw.

​I think most people hear ""base pay"" and assume it works like this:
​Base pay (guaranteed) + commissions for the week = Total pay

​But in reality, it's this:
​Base pay OR commissions, whichever is more.


​So if your base pay is $500 and you make $300 in commissions, you get paid $500, not $800. I can somewhat understand it—if you're not bringing in anything, why would they pay you more than your base?
​However, this pay structure incentivizes you to either not sell at all or to be a top-level earner. 

Being average doesn't benefit you, at all. Let's say I was guaranteed $500. Then, I work really hard to close 10 sales for the week at $51 each, which would be $510 in commissions. I was guaranteed $500 and worked through objections, dealt with rude people, and stood all day just to ""earn"" an extra $10 for the week.

​If I had just scrolled on TikTok for eight hours a day, I would've only made ten bucks less. They always presented the pay as a (blank) or in this case, $10 commission bonus on top of the $500 guaranteed, which seems crazy to me. 

Like why is the base pay even a part of the commission? And why is so much work to obtain ""the bonus""? Which isn't even a bonus.

​The other parts of the pay structure were even stranger. The signed contract guaranteed minimum wage, while the ""verbal agreement"" was somewhat based on hours. This meant you were hoping your leader would guarantee more money than what you literally signed for. 

If you ever complained about the pay, they would probably just laugh and say, ""Look at what you signed.""

​Here's what's interesting: the commissions were already at a high percentage, between 30% and 40%. If the business is running off the remaining 60%, why not remove the commission threshold? I know tech sales are slow after Christmas, and they're managing their money based on the holiday spike, but the pay is still ""meh.""

​I definitely learned a lot more about the DC world after this trip. I also learned that when it comes to Costco, the hiring process is more tedious. I thought after the first two rounds and signing paperwork I would have the job. What they don't tell you is that Costco also has to approve of you. Unlike Target and Walmart. To be fair, Costco has standards, but if I wanted to work at Costco as a Costco employee, I would just do that.

​Now here's something I've never seen before, at least at an entry-level job. At this stage, you weren't doing interviews or leading a team, but office time didn't start at 9 or 10 a.m. It started at 7 a.m.! If you weren't addicted to coffee or white lines before, forget about it.

​I knew that was way too early for me. I think the strangest part of this job wasn't even the pay or the hours; it was the app they used to clock in. It was always tracking you, even if they said it wasn't, and it always required more face-scanning data. 

Of course, you may have used other apps with face scans to unlock your phone or maps data and fingerprints, but those apps are more secure. This was a janky app from a questionable source.

​Also, we weren't allowed to get any samples at Costco.
​I want to add something that really expedited my leaving. The office was always in ""rush mode,"" like the next wave of victims was on their way in. 

It was like they didn't want us to overlap. When someone stayed longer to work on their skills or had questions, they were seen as a pest. One minute they were encouraging a ""student mentality,"" and the next they were pushing you outside.
​
It always felt like, ""just practice with your family and friends when you get home."" Why would I do that when I can practice at work? Especially since this was ""paid"" training. The training portal stuff was done off the clock, so you literally didn't get paid for watching training videos and completing quizzes.

Here's one last kicker. The absolute cherry on top.
The person I interviewed with claimed to be a part of HR team. They spoke ""with their team"" before hiring people..

Turns out there is no ""HR team."" It's all one person, for everything. They were also on the high roller list.

So HR is the owner, team lead, a high roller, and still going out to the field. Impressive, but no way is that sustainable.

I get starting your own office and being a one man army, but this felt pretentious and deceiving.

​The best part about the place were the coworkers. These people were upbeat and cool. I hope they don't lose their spark in such a draining position. I couldn't watch them all slowly fade and be replaced. It would crush me.

Who knows? Maybe they'll catch on and escape like the rest of us in this terrible job market. I would've given them warnings, but for some people this is their only option. Ignorance might be bliss until they find something better.",1,1758523427.0,Devilcorp,1,1.0,False

i don’t know if he still thinks of me.
but after i came back from the comfort room,
he handed me alcohol—
like muscle memory.

he lent me his jacket when i shivered,
sprayed it with his perfume,
maybe worried it carried the scent of the past.

he asked someone to hold an umbrella for me,
since his hands were full.

morning came,
and there was coffee waiting—
the exact taste i once told him i liked,
like he never forgot.

lunch time,
he set the plates, the spoon, the fork,
as if he still knew my rhythm.

i wasn’t feeling well,
they ran out of meds,
so he offered to step outside, buy one for me.

tick tock—
time to leave.
he reached for my things,
but i said no.
before, i would’ve let him.
before, i would’ve smiled at the way he cared.
but we are no longer “before.”

after a year of silence—
nothing but polite hellos at events—
we spoke again.
not about us,
just small things.

and maybe that’s where it ends.
just like that.

entry 2

maybe that’s where it ends.
but when i got home,
i kept replaying the little things—
the jacket, the coffee, the way he still knew.

it made me wonder if people ever really forget,
or if we just learn how to stop reaching out.

i felt sad, but not the same kind of sad i used to feel.
it wasn’t the heartbreak that kept me awake at night.
it was softer, quieter—
like missing a version of myself
that only existed when we were “us.”

and maybe that’s the hardest part.
realizing he can still be kind,
still thoughtful,
but not mine.

i don’t know if he thinks of me,
but i know i thought of him today.
and maybe that’s enough.
maybe that’s closure,
or maybe just another memory
i’ll eventually fold away.

entry 3

days have passed since i saw him.
the moments keep sneaking back,
like background noise i can’t fully mute.

the jacket.
the coffee.
the way he still knew without asking.

i catch myself wondering—
was it just habit for him?
or did he mean something by it?
and then i remind myself:
it doesn’t matter.
it can’t matter.

there’s an ache,
but it’s not sharp anymore.
it’s more like a dull heaviness
that sits quietly in the corner of my chest.

i realize it’s not really him i miss.
it’s the version of me
who felt cared for without needing to ask.
the girl who believed in “before.”

now i’m learning how to be okay
without replaying old routines in my head.
trying to believe that closure
isn’t always a conversation—
sometimes it’s just the silence
that teaches you how to move on.

entry 4

it’s quieter now.
the weight has settled into something lighter,
like a memory folded neatly
at the back of a drawer.

i don’t replay every detail anymore.
sometimes it surfaces—
the coffee, the umbrella, the jacket—
but it doesn’t sting the way it used to.
it just reminds me of a chapter
i once lived in.

i think i’ve finally accepted
that not everything has to continue.
some stories don’t need a sequel,
they just need an ending.

and maybe that’s what this was.
not a goodbye that shattered me,
but a quiet closing of a door
i don’t need to open again.

i can carry the kindness he showed me,
without carrying the weight of what we were.
i can wish him well,
without wishing for us.

and maybe that’s the real closure—
not forgetting,
not erasing,
just learning to remember

Here I visited in Monday afternoon, thought it will be a less crowded time to come. I ordered an ice americano and sat next to the big window, with sun shine shadowing me.

As I digged into the history of this bookstore more, I found out it was founded in late 1990s and was literally the OG of independent bookstore of Foshan. With a cute cat manager accompanying this bookstore, you can find my cat things here - sculptures, pictures, souveniors (find the cat manager profile photo here!) If you will visit Foshan or Guangzhou in the future, put this place into your travelling list as a must-to-try!

Ever stood up after a long sit and thought you just might be turning into a rusty robot? Yeah, me too. It's like all those years of living, laughing, and maybe a little Netflix binging have taken a toll on our flexiblity! If you’re over 50 and feeling like a human pretzel, let’s break free from that stiffness with some super simple stretches that can fit into just 10 minutes! 

Why should we care about mobility? Because we deserve to move without creaking! Here are a few stretches that I’ve found to be game-changers:

1. **Neck Rolls**: 
   - Drop your chin to your chest. 
   - Roll your head to the right, back, and then to the left. 
   - This feels AMAZING after a long day—or sitting on the couch binge-watching your fave show. 

2. **Shoulder Shrugs**:
   - Lift your shoulders up to your ears, hold for a second, and relax back down.
   - Feels like a mini-massage! You can do this while waiting for your morning coffee. 

3. **Torso Twists**:
   - Sit up tall, place your right hand on the back of your chair, and twist gently to the right. Hold for a few breaths.
   - Switch sides and let's just appreciate how stretchy we're becoming!  

4. **Cat-Cow Pose** (bonus for the yogis):
   - On all fours, round your back like a cat (who hasn’t been sassy before?). Then, dip your belly and look up to the sky like a proud cow.
   - I swear it makes me feel ten years younger, even if just for a moment!

5. **Hip Flexor Stretch**:
   - Get into a lunge position, knee on the ground, and push your hips forward gently. 
   - It’s like saying, “Hey, body—let’s remember how to groove!”

Laughter and a little silliness make the process even more enjoyable! Remember, it’s not about becoming the next yoga guru, but just reclaiming the joy of moving freely. A little stretch here and there can work wonders. Think of this like your daily dose of ‘Awaken the Body’, because we believe in the strongest people! 💪 Just like how a little effort can lead to big impacts in how we feel. 

Also, if you need a little extra support on your journey, check out some fantastic resources that can help you level up your retirement game 🕵️‍♀️ [here](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb).

Let's all make sure we’re not just surviving, but thriving, as we age. What stretches have you found that work for you? Or do you just believe in power naps? Because those count too! 🙌✨

Is there a best practice for this? I was thinking of just dipping paper towels in Moon Water while music plays and gently cleaning the items and the bowl itself (and dumping out old coffee grounds). Will this mess anything up? I’m just fearful of disrupting the energies.

I’ve also seen people say they “refresh” their bowl routinely to keep the magic flowing. Any best practices for this, too? Thanks :)",2,1758522808.0,witchcraft,1,1.0,False
1nnf5av,https://www.reddit.com/r/loudscarytruestories/comments/1nnf5av/my_horror_story_as_a_funeral_home_worker/,My Horror Story as a Funeral Home Worker,"People always ask me if working at a funeral home is creepy. I usually laugh it off and tell them the truth: you get used to it. After a while, the sight of lifeless faces, the quiet halls, the smell of disinfectant it all becomes part of the job. The living, not the dead, were what used to scare me. At least, that was how I felt before one particular night.

I’d been working the late shift for about three years. My tasks were straightforward answering calls, completing paperwork, and sometimes, if a body came in after hours, making sure it was properly situated in the prep room until morning. It wasn’t glamorous, but steady pay isn’t something you take for granted.

The funeral home itself was an older building, the kind with peeling wallpaper and creaky floors. At night, it had that cavernous stillness that swallowed sound. I kept a tiny radio in my office just to fill the silence, though most nights I turned it down to a whisper so I could still hear if someone pulled up in the parking lot.

That night, nothing seemed unusual. Around 11 p.m., I checked the schedule and noted three services for the next day, one of which involved an embalming session scheduled first thing in the morning. The body, an elderly man who had passed just that afternoon, was in cold storage. I’d wheeled him in myself and triple-checked the paperwork.

Around midnight, I decided to grab a cup of coffee from the lounge area. That’s when I heard it.

A sound, faint but distinct, coming from down the hall. At first, I thought it was the building settling old wood groaning under its own weight. But then it came again. A dragging sound. Slow. Rhythmic. Like something heavy being pulled across the linoleum floor.

I told myself it was probably just my imagination. Too many horror movies rattling around in my head. Still, my legs carried me toward the prep room, where the sound seemed to originate. The closer I got, the more certain I became that it wasn’t in my head. Something was moving in there.

I hesitated outside the prep room door, hand hovering over the handle, when the dragging stopped. Complete silence. I could hear my own breathing, shallow and quick. Finally, I pushed the door open.

Everything looked as it should. The stainless-steel counters gleamed under the fluorescent lights, the smell of chemicals sharp in the air. The cold storage doors were all closed. The gurney was right where I’d left it.

And then the light above me flickered. Just once. Enough to make shadows jump across the room.

My eyes caught on the cold storage unit. The locker assigned to the old man. The door wasn’t quite shut anymore. It hung just slightly ajar no more than an inch.

My stomach dropped. I knew with absolute certainty I had closed it tight. Funeral home workers don’t make those kinds of mistakes.

I took a step closer, trying to convince myself it had somehow slipped open, though the lock mechanism wasn’t built for that. That’s when I heard the slow, scraping drag again—but this time, it was from inside the storage unit.

I didn’t open it. I couldn’t. Instead, I backed out of the room, slammed the prep door shut, and locked it from the outside.

The next morning, when the embalming team arrived, everything was normal. The locker was closed, sealed tight as if nothing had happened. I never told anyone. How do you explain something like that without sounding insane?

All I know is, whenever someone asks now if working at a funeral home is creepy, I just say, *You have no idea.*",1,1758522781.0,loudscarytruestories,0,1.0,False

The next day, I signed a marriage contract with Adrian Cole—the city’s most ruthless CEO. He promised me respect, not love. But respect was more than I ever had… and dangerously close to everything I wanted.”  


The hotel alarms screamed past midnight, red lights flashing against polished marble. Doors flew open. Guests poured out in robes and panic. In the chaos, I saw him.



Lucas. Barefoot, towel slung low, his neck covered in marks I didn’t give him. Beside him, Mandy clutched his arm, trembling with rehearsed fragility.



“Eve?” His voice was soft, guilty.



“She was scared,” Mandy whispered, eyes glistening. “Her lock broke. I only called Lucas for help.”



I said nothing. The police herded us outside, cameras flashing. Lucas wrapped Mandy in a blanket like she was porcelain. To the crowd, they looked like a couple. To me, they looked like a choice.



Lucas tried his old trick—the boyish regret, the soulful eyes. “Evelyn, don’t make a scene.”



I almost laughed. Cruel, he’d call me. Cruel for refusing to set myself on fire just to keep him warm.



My phone buzzed. My mother’s voice was steady. “There’s someone I want you to meet. Adrian Cole. CEO of Cole Group. Dinner tomorrow.”



Cole. A name that owned half the skyline. A man the press called ruthless, brilliant, untouchable.



“I’ll be there,” I told her.



Back inside my apartment, I packed neatly: sweaters folded, heels lined, memories left behind. Lucas’s key stayed in the dish by the door.



At 3 a.m., his message lit up my phone. You home? I’ll bring soup.



I typed back: Don’t come. I’m sleeping.



By evening, I was in Cole Tower, sixty stories above the city. The private dining room glowed against the skyline.



Adrian Cole rose when I entered. Taller than I’d imagined, sharper than his photographs. Black suit, no tie. His eyes assessed me like an equation.



“Ms. Yun,” he said.



“Mr. Cole.”



We sat. No wasted pleasantries.



“I don’t do blind dates,” he said. “But I understand alliances.”



“Arrangements,” I corrected.



“Arrangements,” he agreed, and the word sounded less like surrender, more like strategy.



His gaze didn’t waver. “What do you want, Ms. Yun?”



For once, I didn’t lie. “Respect. Partnership. A man who never asks me to dim.”



A muscle ticked in his jaw. “Good. I don’t do dim.”



I lifted my glass. “To arrangements.”



He lifted his. “To terms.”



Outside, the city pulsed. Inside, something dangerous and new began to breathe.

\##Chapter 2



By the time Lucas finally came home, my suitcase was already zipped. Clothes gone from the closet, drawers half-empty, the life we’d built reduced to neat piles ready for donation.



He froze in the doorway. “What are you doing?”



“Decluttering.” My voice was even.



He frowned, confused. “You’re overreacting. I’ll explain everything. Mandy just—”



I cut him off. “Don’t.”



His cologne lingered, sweet and suffocating. I wanted him gone from the room, from my lungs, from my life. But he didn’t move. He studied me like I was still the woman who cried when he forgot anniversaries, who waited at restaurants until the staff began stacking chairs.



“I was going to marry you,” he said quietly. “Everything we’ve built—don’t throw it away.”



I stared at the suitcase. Seven years. Three hospital visits I never told anyone about. Countless nights waiting, excusing, forgiving. That wasn’t building. That was bleeding.



“You never planned to marry me,” I said. “You just liked having me around.”



His jaw tightened. He reached for his phone, almost panicked, as if Mandy could text him the right words. I caught a glimpse before he snatched it away—wedding gown photos. Mandy smiling in white.



Something inside me snapped clean. “You should go to her,” I said. “She needs you more than I do.”



For the first time, Lucas looked afraid. Not of losing me, but of losing control. “You can’t just leave. You’re mine.”



I should have laughed. Instead, I walked past him, suitcase wheels clicking against the floor like a countdown. At the door, I left his key on the table. “Not anymore.”



Cole Tower again. The next evening.



Adrian Cole was waiting in the same private dining room, black sleeves rolled, no tie again. He looked like a man allergic to pretense, which was ironic for someone who ruled the city with steel and glass.



“You came back,” he said, not surprised.



“I said I would.”



He studied me, then nodded. “I respect people who honor their word.”



Dinner was efficient, courses appearing like clockwork. He asked about my career, my numbers, my decisions under pressure. Not once did he ask about Lucas. It was as if my past was irrelevant, only my potential mattered.



When dessert came, he leaned back, eyes sharp. “I need a wife who understands contracts as much as vows. Someone who won’t embarrass me in front of the board. In return, you’ll have security, power, and freedom most women only dream of.”



Most women. I thought of Mandy, of the way she cried to get what she wanted. I thought of Lucas, who had promised me everything and delivered excuses.



“And what about love?” I asked.



His lips curved, not into a smile but something darker. “Love is a luxury. Respect is non-negotiable.”



Something in me recognized the truth of that. Respect was what I’d been starving for all these years.



I lifted my glass again. “Then we have a deal.”



His eyes held mine, steady and unblinking. “We’ll see, Ms. Yun. We’ll see.”



Outside, the skyline glittered. Inside, I realized I wasn’t just walking away from Lucas. I was walking into fire.

\##Chapter 3



Two days later, a black car waited outside my apartment. The driver said nothing, only held the door as if I had always belonged inside.



Cole Tower loomed again, sharp against the morning sky. This time, I wasn’t led to a dining room. I was taken straight to the executive floor. The glass doors opened to an office so vast it felt like its own country—walls of windows, a desk like a throne, and Adrian Cole standing at its center, as if the city were just another one of his possessions.



“Ms. Yun.” He gestured toward a folder on the desk. “Our contract.”



I sat. The leather chair swallowed me whole, but I forced myself upright. Inside the folder, the terms were as precise as any merger:



A marriage, legally binding, within three months.



Public appearances as required.



Discretion, loyalty, and respect.



In exchange: full financial security, my career protected, doors opened that most analysts would kill to walk through.



My throat tightened. “You wrote this like a business deal.”



He looked at me steadily. “Marriage is a business deal. Love complicates assets. Respect builds them.”



“Cold,” I murmured.



“Efficient,” he corrected. “But if you have amendments, say them now.”



I scanned the pages again. The contract was ironclad, ruthless—and strangely, it offered me something Lucas never had: clarity.



“I have one condition,” I said.



His brow lifted. “Which is?”



“I will not be invisible. If I’m to stand by your side, I expect to be acknowledged. Not hidden. Not silenced.”



For a long moment, silence stretched between us. Then, unexpectedly, his mouth curved—the faintest ghost of a smile. “Agreed.”



I signed. So did he.



The ink had barely dried when his phone buzzed. His expression hardened as he glanced at it. “We’ll announce the engagement next week. Be ready for scrutiny.”



Scrutiny. A polite word for scandal.



That night, Lucas showed up at my apartment.



He pounded on the door until I opened it, more annoyed than afraid. He looked disheveled, like the polished man who once charmed investors had cracked.



“You’re serious?” His voice broke. “You’re really marrying him? Adrian Cole?”



I didn’t answer. Silence was louder than yes.



He laughed bitterly, raking a hand through his hair. “You think he cares about you? He doesn’t. He’s using you. You’ll just be another trophy on his arm.”



“And what was I to you, Lucas?” My words were sharper than glass. “A placeholder until Mandy was old enough to play house?”



His face twisted. “You don’t understand. Mandy needed me. She’s fragile—”



I slammed the door before he could finish. Fragile was just another word men used when they wanted women weak.



Back at Cole Tower, Adrian’s assistant handed me a calendar. Meetings, galas, a charity event that weekend. My presence was required at every one.



When Adrian joined us, I asked, “Why the rush?”



He glanced at me, dark eyes unreadable. “Because power moves fast, Ms. Yun. If you don’t keep up, you get run over.”



And just like that, I realized: this wasn’t just an arrangement. It was a battlefield.

\##Chapter 4



The first test came sooner than I expected.



On Wednesday morning, Adrian’s assistant forwarded me a news alert. A grainy photo had already spread online: me, leaving Cole Tower the night I signed the contract. Head down, coat pulled tight, Adrian walking two steps behind.



The caption screamed: Mystery Woman Spotted with Cole Group CEO.



Within hours, speculation exploded. Blogs dissected my clothes, strangers debated my worthiness, and one column cruelly labeled me the rebound nobody wanted.



Adrian’s response? Calm, almost bored. “The press is predictable. They’ll invent a story whether we give them one or not.”



I wanted to sound equally detached. Instead, I asked, “And what story will we give them?”



His eyes lingered on me, sharp but steady. “The truth I choose. That you’re my fiancée.”



At lunch, Lucas called. Five times. I ignored the first four, but the fifth came with a message: If you don’t meet me, I’ll come find you.



I agreed, if only to prevent a scene. We met at the café where we used to celebrate anniversaries. He looked polished again, hair slicked back, suit pressed—but desperation clung to him like smoke.



“You don’t belong in his world, Evelyn,” he said, leaning across the table. “He’ll chew you up and spit you out.”



“Funny,” I replied. “That’s exactly what you did.”



His jaw tightened. “You’re making a mistake. Adrian Cole doesn’t love you.”



“I didn’t sign up for love,” I said flatly. “I signed up for respect. Something you never gave me.”



For a moment, he faltered. Then he reached for my hand, voice breaking. “We have history. Seven years. Doesn’t that mean anything?”



I pulled back before he could touch me. “It means I learned what I will never tolerate again.”



I left him sitting there, eyes hollow, coffee growing cold.



That evening, Adrian called me into his office. The city glowed behind him, the skyline painted in steel and fire.



“You saw Lucas today,” he said, not a question.



“Are you keeping tabs on me?”



“I don’t need to,” he replied coolly. “He’s predictable. Men like him always are.”



I bristled. “He won’t give up easily.”



Adrian stepped closer, his presence swallowing the space between us. “Then he’ll learn the consequences. You’re under my protection now. Anyone who undermines that—” His voice dropped, soft but dangerous. “—will regret it.”



It should have scared me. Instead, I felt the ground steady beneath me for the first time in years.



“Protection,” I echoed. “Is that part of the contract?”



His gaze locked with mine. “No. That’s personal.”



For the first time, I realized Adrian Cole wasn’t just efficient or cold. He was possessive, too. And I wasn’t sure yet if that was safety—or another kind of fire.



By Friday, invitations for the Cole Foundation Gala had gone out. A thousand guests. A hundred cameras. And me, walking in on Adrian’s arm for the first time.



The engagement would be official.

I wrote down all the authentic beautiful messy magical stuff about him. The little things, that you only get to know about a person when you are really close to them. Those nuisances that we all have, that only make sense to us, but the people who care about us get why. 

Our habits, preferences, patterns, and unique logic that drives us to move the way we do in the world. The stuff that most people miss, or we don’t let them in our most private of worlds, the things we do that are weird and uniquely special to us, pay attention to, share with you, and let you carefully enter our worlds, the everyday secrets that make us human. 

I wrote down all these things about him. It took me about 7 minutes; and I nailed far more than any of the everybody’s at the bars he lives at, more than his closest childhood friend and I far exceeded any woman he dated in the past. 

It was easy, I watched him, paid close attention, valued what he held dear, respected his preferences, embraced his wacky and weird, learned sometimes his way works better, and did what he needed to feel safe. I loved him. He doesn’t grasp that when a woman pays attention and mirrors the little things that you prefer…. 

That’s intimacy that’s real love and that’s the stuff that counts. The greatest orgasm , barely touches your sunset person just getting you, seeing you for you, accepting you, and loving your most crazy idiosyncrasies. 

He would tell me that I speak with a better than everyone tone is I used the words idiosyncrasies. I’d explain, I love words, I love reading, researching, writing, word puzzles, read a book aloud to me, shit ; read  a menu to me full description of each entree, make up your own names for your crayon box, write and write, and write some more. 

Yes, he would put me down for the way I spoke, the words I used, the tone of my voice no matter how appropriate and sincere it was ( at times). Yes, he would take my greatest passion, my gift to impact and influence others through my written words and make it a fault. My carefully executed word choice as an attempt to rain down to him. Than he’d turn around and use the word idiosyncrasies in a sentence to articulate yet another thing wrong with Nikki. 

This was just the tip of the iceberg, we barely got to the gate, but once we entered his goal on a daily basis was to belittle, degrade, correct, and appear disgusted by everything I did. He called it offering his feedback, insight and advice to help me. Needless to say, I needed a lot of help even on things I excelled at like cooking, parenting my children, or finding a job. Before I knew it, i stopped talking to him all together. He verbally said aloud, that the way I was breathing annoyed him. He was just beginning to ramp up. 

So at the height of his abuse, cheating , betrayals, lies, and daily gaslighting. I would add some more “ C” words to my repertoire of adjectives to describe this emotionally immature , unsafe man. Radley ‘s words  were “ Collaterall and Consalation”. I’ll share with you an example of  what happened, fairly recently. 

Buy me a surprise I said when he told me on the phone he was at Walmart - “a pack of gum, a Pom Pom “. Anything , I was so determined to make him a good person. 

This man brings me :

Two Walmart grey towels 
Leave in hair conditioner 
Pack of tea lights 
One Halloween dish rag 
A candle 

Talk about a guilt, and the last remains of dignity gift. How much more generic can you get? It’s like the gift you bring to the office for your white elephant exchange. Neutral, no thought, we will accept and use them and that’s about as far as we go. Typically, I am an over the top grateful woman when I receive a gift. A gift for me, that might be homemade, from the dollar store, or one that the giver put TIME, EFFORT AND ENERGY INTO. Radley’s “ gifts” lacked all three of the above components. 

With the exception of the dishrag, you know the $5, doesn’t need a pair - one. None of these extraordinary gifts were for me. Big surprise there, but I played the role again. I praised him for the breadcrumbs he threw me. This man, literally said to me- “ what do you mean by breadcrumbs Nikki?l”. This was his latest 2am role in to me, after his bender of “ fun” , cranky irritable with nothing left for me in pocket or spirit, wanted me to bow down and welcome him, not a penny to his name, dirty, and as usual he only had one thing to offer- his penis. 

He’d turn on the fake sweet little puppy boy act for about 3-4 minutes before whipping his dick out. Idc and knew at that point - I knew who he was shoving it in before me. For awhile I believed he wasn’t, even once I knew he was, he’d lie over and over and over.. but I knew. I still loved him, and I loved him F#%king me. Sex remember is a love language- 100% legit and so freaking us. 

We’d have sex, after he finished I’d get a glimpse of the man I loved. About 3-4 minutes- tops post sex or bj. Then he’d wait for me to get up and give him a towel and he’d clean up. He’d then wipe himself off, throw the towel on the floor and that’s where it would remain until I picked it up after he left. 

He’d then go downstairs, make himself coffee, not offering me any. At this time was likely when he helped himself to my son Logan’s beer. Logan only noticed it tonight, no one else drinks beer in this home. He came back upstairs with a hot cup of coffee and said, “ you didn’t want any coffee right? Of course I said “no, I’m good”. 

Radley  knew my house inside and out, it had been 2 1/2 years that I remained on his Merry- Go-Round of Horror. I came to not think I was worth much of anything.
I was grateful, and thanked him for his gifts. 
His gifts titled: I am a liar, cheater , abuser, GUILT GIFTS- the precious and special Walmart towels. Consolation Prizes from Broken Radley…

Where do I sign up? Let’s go around again..  Yay! That was me, just a couple days ago. I’m not okay, I knew it was abuse and I’m ashamed, hurt and ask myself all day long- WHY? And HOW could he do this to me? How did I let him, why did I take it and keep accepting his abusive treatment and leftover scraps? I have to accept I can’t ask him for answers, too much of a coward and he’d lie anyway. My answers come from within- but I can’t find them yet. It’s gonna take awhile. 

Give Radley opportunity, he will steal every time from me . Really not just from me, from anyone. I’m the collateral damage that needs to take the hit so he can get his. 

Then he will root through my stuff, for no reason, or whatever reason he provided that I was suppose to believe. He’d lose his phone, keys, wallet, smokes and turn to ask me if I’ve seen any of these items in a frustrated voice. Thing was he wouldn’t move, he expected me to get up and search for his things while he lay there. Claimed he didn’t want me to move or do anything- but we both knew the rules. 

He then proceeded to “ clean ” my bedroom mirror with a very white , almost new Anne Taylor shirt. When I said something, knowing it was my shirt, he told me what a poor job I did at cleaning my mirror. I cleaned my mirror the night before. The NIGHT BEFORE! There’s a towel in the bathroom five feet away, a sock, grab some paper towels downstairs. Nope- my white shirt. I said is that my white shirt, he said he didn’t know as he continued to crumble it into a ball- to wipe the slightest of films from the mirror. The white shirt, not thrown on the floor ; remained scrunched in a ball, dirty on my bed stand. 

My god, if I ever did that with any of his stuff I would still be hearing about failing to respect his stuff. I threw my dirty clothes in the hamper or the floor. I also picked up his dirty clothes off the floor after sex, folded them nicely or hung them up per his orderly preference- almost EVERY TIME. My stuff, didn’t matter:  if it was a picture my child painted when 5 years old, if he needed a placemat, a flat surface, a coaster for his coffee- he respected me so little of course my stuff was just stuff to him. 

Then he’d proceed to take a shower, he liked my shower. Of course he did, this was the drain he fixed. Of course he could shower, no issue there. Once out of the shower he’d come talk with me, wanting to pick my brain for my professional expertise on an estimate for this handyman job or that . He’d want go through what was on his plate, what he worried about and the expectation was I gave him my full attention, asked questions, showed sincere interest, and brought my best self to the table, accepting the breadcrumbs of bare minimum he’d throw at me. I did so willingly every time- to the point it became his norm and the precedent I allowed and tolerated in the name of still sharing love, care, and friendship for one another.  This was just  how he moved- it’s sadly who he is. 

Back to my special gift from Walmart- aka I’m a dirty lying child-man that feels a twinge of guilt. Aka- I need and want something, let me play the sweet puppy and throw Nikki a bone… literally. 

My gift explained: 

- 2 Towels- for him to use in my shower 
- Leave in conditioner- he has beautiful curly dark hair, okay it’s receding but he is 40. Remember “ everybody “ thinks he’s 26 and in the band. To his credit he  did buy two bottles. Why two, one for himself of course! 
- Tea lights- that he wanted waste and light them all the other night. “ I wanted to play with them” he told me as I took half away. No intention of anything authentic or sweet for or about me. Yet he chastised me for not allowing him to light all 30 of them. Of course I apologized. 
- Candle- he needed one in his bedroom he told me, the last one I bought him. He wanted me to smell the two candles , identify the one I liked best. Then he’d take that one. 
- Dish towel- who buys only one???
- I’ll tell you. Men in their 40’s that live with their parents, and never built a life on their own or with a partner.  Men that are lying, abusing, and cheating ; BUT still find some worth in the woman,  and want to keep this thing going for their benefit. Men that are allowed to do this by the abused women that tolerate it and think it’s their fault. That’s where I am today- shameful. 

Yes, a woman only becomes collateral damage if she accepts, praises, and thanks him for these absent of any thought , AMAZING, special just for Nikki, more impersonal than the DMV customer service automated menu. I am that woman, So embarrassed and disappointed in myself for setting the foundation to only foster and nurture his abuse. I just wanted him to be a good person. To care for me, to show up. He offered none of these things, yet I tolerated breadcrumbs and abuse. 

These were my gifts. Which we had to lay out on the counter and discuss how thoughtful and special each of them were. Singing his praises to the heavens.  I’m his pop tart cheerleader. Ra Ra Radley! “ This hair conditioner is the best, it makes your hair so soft”. That dishrag was $5, but I knew you’d like it. “You are always looking for towels”. , am I? I had to thank him  3 times, and once on the phone and once by texts. He doesn’t even read my texts, the thank you for the stuff, that was nice- he read because he replied thank you. 


I’m a giver, I give and give to those I love because it makes me feel good to provide what others may enjoy. I give because I want to. I give to those close to me, and those I don’t even know. Twenty years I’ve worked in the non - profit world, giving myself to vulnerable populations. To serve, support, aide and make the smallest difference in another human’s life. It’s my purpose, my sense of community and belonging, it calls to me, helps define who I am as a person. 

Radley he’s a taker. Like I said he’d rumage through my stuff to see what might interest him. If he wanted it, well he’d just take it. POOF it would disappear, most call that stealing- not Radley and I. Anything, from a joint, charger, alcohol( Logan’s beer),clothes, money, smokes, you name it. He comes offering nothing, maybe a scrap here or there, and leaves with anything he wants in his backpack. It’s like a one stop Radley shop at Nikki’s house, every time  and I mean Every. I should just be thankful that he’d grace me with his remarkable,  stand up proud, good guy self.  For real, that’s what he wants. I fell in line every time, and I mean Every! 

Sometimes I’d find my stuff in his car, backpack, bedroom etc ., I’d react annoyed and say Come on.., really ? Again? Of course, he’d then be the one with the issue stating “ I told him to take it, or I saw him put it in his backpack and didn’t say anything. “ what’s the big deal you knew I had it I was going to bring it back”. It wasn’t the stuff, I would have , and HAVE given him my last dollar. The problem is he is a taker, and will take my last dollar, when he has a $20 bill in his pocket. 

He will steal my lightbulbs, that were new and changed color, replace the lightbulbs with standard white ones stored in a box in my bedroom and not think twice. Not about the light bulbs, it’s about the violation of trust and you just don’t steal. Good people don’t steal! 

Then I’d go over his house, observe with my own eyes my light bulbs in his lamp, glowing GREEN, and ask does that light turn any other colors and he’d simply say NO- that conversation was over.

Perhaps the slimmest and just the other day was my t-shirts. Mind you, I just bought a really cool pair of retro striped joggers for myself. Of course , he took those too. Well I gave them to him, he took them even after he knew his penis came to me used, and he’s wear the joggers I gave him the following day when his penis fell in her again. I already knew, I asked him 100 times… every which way to the point of vomitting. 

I just wanted to take back my dignity, to salvage and honor the love we shared, to see him as a good person and not a monster. I didn’t want him, I knew it was costing me myself. I knew he was a cheater a liar, a bad person. I knew I was being abused. 

Yet, I made it safe and simply asked for the truth again again. He took it as I wanted a relationship with him. Ugh, no I just wanted to know if you were having sex with other woman so I then COULD MAKE MY OWN CHOICE- to have sex with him. I don’t sleep with more than one person at a time. I’m a mom of three, I don’t want STD’s. Of course, Radley was already having sexual encounters with other woman. Radley continued to have sex with me, putting me at risk, and denied me of even the possibility to make a safe choice. Reminder- I gotta go get an STD test at the doctor. Who was I kidding , this man looked me in the eye and the lies grew like weeds from his mouth. Right from wrong, not for Radley. 

Tshirts. I shipped two new tshirts to his house in error. I was excited, one was a cute baby tshirt and the other was a “ Blondie” comic tshirt. No… of course he didn’t tell me he received these tshirts at his home. I had to ask. Oh did I ask, about 12—15 times. I saw on Amazon they went to his home and asked he bring them to me or I’d stop by and grab them. I wanted the Blondie tshirt- I’m a tall blonde and I love her music. 

He said the shirts were at his house, annoyed by my request. He said he thought I sent them to him, as a gift ( most of us send our unfaithful lying monsters gifts right?). 

Needless to say as of three days ago, I’m still asking for my tshirts. This was before I got the most devastating news of my life. The reason inspiring this blog, the strength to tell the truth, tell my story , no matter how ashamed I am with myself and what I allowed him to do. I’m not ready to get into the news, but it’s heavy. It’s loss, while adding to my trauma throw in a little Radley  abuse. Spreading his magic. 

He was the first person I called when I got the awful news, I needed him to show up. To just be with me until I could  catch my breath. To not do a thing , but be there. Listen to me talk  through how I’d share this news with my children. CARE FOR ME- to F*%king CARE FOR ME. 

We spoke on the phone, he was with her, he said he couldn’t come right now. Of course he did. I said I needed him to come, even she said go, he said he’d come. 

News flash - he NEVER SHOWED UP. Life changing, heart wrenching, painful news- this man didn’t show up. Wouldn’t even take my call. Hence I write. 

Well- enjoy the pic below. Here’s my former monster and abuser. Dressed head to toe, by yours truly, wearing what you ask? Look carefully, my BLONDIE tshirt. 

The same night I lay paralyzed in pain about the news I received. Radley has got the biggest, goofiest grin on his face, just doing his thing enjoying life, getting his D wet with ___. 

No Nikki he hasn’t had sex with anyone else, he and I talked about being open and honest with one another when this happened. Well I talked about it, then led my lead we’d stop having sex with each other. Radley claimed “he hadn’t been with anyone but me. “ I’m telling you the truth Nikki”. “ I haven’t even kissed anyone” Have you, how can I believe that Nikki?” “ What the f*%k do you want me to do if you don’t believe me”. 

It’s all just so cruel and wrong, I’m ashamed to even write this. I hope this starts my journey to heal and trust there are good people in the world. 

I can’t take anymore Monsters.

1nnf0kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/MitolynReddit/comments/1nnf0kp/has_anyone_tried_mitolyn_sharing_my_review_reddit/,Has Anyone Tried Mitolyn? (Sharing My Review – Reddit Discussion),"Hey folks,

I don’t usually post about supplements, but I’ve been experimenting with ways to improve my energy levels and overall health since my work-from-home routine has me feeling more sluggish than I’d like. Recently, I came across **Mitolyn**, a supplement that’s been getting some attention for supporting metabolism and mitochondrial function (basically, the “powerhouse” of your cells).

I’ve only been trying it for a few weeks, so this isn’t some “miracle cure” story or anything like that. But here’s what I’ve noticed so far:

* **Energy**: I don’t get that mid-afternoon crash as badly. I can actually get through my workload without reaching for a 3rd cup of coffee.
* **Digestion/comfort**: Could be placebo, but I’ve felt less bloated lately, especially after heavier meals.
* **Mood/clarity**: I feel a little sharper and less foggy when I start my day.

Obviously, it’s way too early to say if it’s a long-term solution, and I know supplements can work differently for everyone. I’m also keeping my diet/exercise consistent so I can see if Mitolyn itself is making any real difference.

Curious if anyone else here has tried it or heard about it? Did you notice anything, good or bad?

1nneztn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtHomeEssentials/comments/1nneztn/how_do_i_find_space_heater_deals/,How do I find space heater deals?,"Hey everyone! I've been on a mission lately to find the best deals on space heaters, and I thought I'd share what I've learned after spending way too many hours researching and comparing prices.

First off, let me tell you why I started this hunt. My apartment gets ridiculously cold in certain spots during winter, and running the central heating full blast was killing my electricity bill. I needed a solution that wouldn't break the bank.

After lots of research, I discovered that convection heaters are actually pretty efficient for spot heating. They work by circulating warm air throughout the room, which I found more effective than those basic radiator-style heaters I used to have.

One thing I learned is that timing is everything when shopping for space heaters. The best deals usually pop up in early fall or late winter when retailers are either trying to kick off the season or clear out inventory. I recently found some amazing deals here: https://athometouch.com/space-heater

Some money-saving tips I picked up along the way:
- Compare prices across multiple retailers
- Look for energy-efficient models (they save money in the long run)
- Check for seasonal clearance sales
- Keep an eye on daily deal websites
- Sign up for retailer newsletters (they often send exclusive discounts)

What really surprised me was the variety of features available nowadays. Some models come with remote controls, programmable thermostats, and even humidity settings. I personally prefer ones with tip-over protection and automatic shut-off features - safety first, right?

If you're in the market for a space heater right now, I'd definitely recommend checking out this collection of deals: https://athometouch.com/space-heater. They've got some solid options with good safety features and energy efficiency ratings.

A quick word of advice: don't just go for the cheapest option. I made that mistake once and ended up with a heater that barely warmed my coffee table, let alone the room. Look for something with good reviews and reliable safety features.

What's been your experience with space heaters? Have you found any particularly good deals lately? I'd love to hear about it in the comments!

Lastly, remember to factor in the long-term costs when making your decision. A slightly more expensive but more efficient model might save you money on your electricity bill in the long run. Trust me, I learned this the hard way!",1,1758522198.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False
1nnezqc,https://i.redd.it/n1wh3tbbtnqf1.jpeg,"Decants review - Afnan 9PM rebel, Versace Dylan Blue, Lattafa Suqraat, Rayhaan Lion and Liquid Brun","I received the first three at the start of June, and the last two in middle of August. Being a student in a management school (AC classes and halls to preserve the scent during daytime - you can draw parallels to anoffice environment), I wanted two freshies (one blue and one green) and a playful evening fragrance. I reached out to more than 10 people of this sub (both reviewers and sellers)- many of whom helped me with my choice.

Afnan 9PM Rebel 9/10 7+ hours  
Very loud, announces your arrival. Think pineapple cotton candy opening that settles down to a caramel, musk and spicy musky drydown. 2 sprays are enough because it starts off very synthetic and very very loud. Better people than me can discuss if it is a Aventus+BR540 baby or a better QAF. An addictive fragrance that makes you keep sniffing your wrists.  
The seller (Whiff Culture) recommended this to me after I had already decided on the Dylan Blue and Suqraat. [https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Afnan/9-PM-Rebel-99238.html](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Afnan/9-PM-Rebel-99238.html)

Versace Dylan Blue 8/10 4+ hours  
Safe blue freshie. Very corporate. An expensive bodywash that leaves you smelling clean. Starts off as citrusy talcum, drydown smells like a piece of wood that has been left at the sea shore. very versatile, but doesn't project as much after the first half hour or so (turns into a skin scent). [https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Versace-Pour-Homme-Dylan-Blue-40031.html](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Versace-Pour-Homme-Dylan-Blue-40031.html)

Lattafa Suqraat 6/10 4+ hours  
Pushing for a ADG Profumo (RIP) clone made me buy this. While the ADG base is present (smoky woody green), it doesn't resemble the Profumo until you spray it more than 6 times and you tell yourself that it does. The drydown is a lavender moss peppery scent. Other than my bias, it's a great starter pack perfume. Very versatile but weak. again, doesn't project well. Almost couldn't smell it after I had to travel by bike for half an hour. [https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Suqraat-75471.html](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Suqraat-75471.html)

Rayhaan Lion 10/10 8+ hours  
JPG Ultra male is a top three perfume for me, and this is a 1 to 1 replica for me. I was pushing for a Afnan 9PM and the seller and their whatsapp channel told me to get this instead. Smells like a million bucks straight out of the box - pear, citrus and lavender that forms a cloud around you that everyone wants to be in (2-3 sprays). The dry down has vanilla and amber. It's a very ""comfortable"" scent and you keep feeling better about yourself because of the insane projection  (keeping in mind it hasn't fully macerated yet). Always gets complements. Will buy a full bottle soon. [https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rayhaan/Lion-105031.html](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rayhaan/Lion-105031.html)

Liquid Brun 7/10 7+ hours  
Very cloying in the day time, not yet macerated enough to distinguish properly. Think of it as a toasted vanilla marshmallow being dipped into coffee infused with orange. Will be a great winter scent. Opening is very synthetic for now. The depth isn't yet evident but the fragrance is very interesting to say the least - you'll feel like you're stepping into a Moroccan cafe with an in-house bakery. Great longevity (will smell it on your clothes the next day). Also haven't tested much because it's a 10 ML decant.

At that very moment, a decade of love shattered - something darker, colder, and more dangerous was born within me.



They stole my marriage, my dignity, my future... but they don't know that I'm about to take it all back.



……



The elevator chimed softly as it reached the thirty-ninth floor of the Delacroix Tower, our Manhattan fortress of glass and steel. I stepped out, heels clicking against marble, carrying a tray from my favorite French patisserie—an indulgence meant to surprise my husband, Adrian.



Ten years of marriage, and I still believed in surprises. In gestures. In the fantasy that love could be mended with sweetness.



The penthouse was quiet—too quiet. No staff bustling. No music humming from the sound system. Just silence.



“Adrian?” I called, my voice echoing against the vast walls.



No answer.



I set the tray down, slipped off my heels, and padded toward his study. A faint sound reached me—low, breathless laughter. A woman’s laughter.



The world tilted before I even saw them.



Adrian, my husband, the golden prince of the Delacroix family, sat sprawled on the leather couch. His shirt unbuttoned, his tie loose. And draped across his lap was her—a cascade of dark hair, red silk slipping down smooth shoulders, lips pressed against his throat.



My chest clenched. My pulse roared. The air itself seemed to thicken into glass.



Her name surfaced instantly: Juliette Moreau. I had seen her at galas, flashing her perfect smile, a family friend with whispers of ambition clinging to her like perfume.



Now she was in my home. On my husband.



The tray of pastries slipped from my hands, porcelain shattering across the floor. Adrian’s head jerked up, his eyes locking with mine.



Not guilt. Not shock. Just recognition.



“Elena,” he said, his tone maddeningly calm. “You weren’t supposed to be home yet.”



Juliette turned, lipstick smudged, smirk curling. “Oh,” she said lightly, smoothing her dress without shame. “Well. This is… awkward.”



Awkward?



The life I had built, the years I had given, crumbled in a single word.



Before I could speak, another voice cut through the room.



“Better you found out now.”



I turned. And there she was—Vivienne Delacroix. My mother-in-law. The queen of the dynasty. Her diamond necklace glittered like armor, her gaze sharp enough to slice bone.



“You were never meant to carry this family forward,” she said coolly. “Juliette will give us what you cannot—a future. An heir.”



The words landed like daggers. My infertility—the scar I carried in silence—now wielded like a weapon against me.



Juliette leaned against Adrian’s shoulder, victorious. Vivienne’s lips curved, satisfied.



And Adrian? My husband? He said nothing. He just buttoned his shirt, as if I were already irrelevant.



In that moment, something inside me broke.



The Elena they knew—the loyal wife, the woman who still believed in love—died.



What rose in her place was colder. Sharper. A woman who would not be discarded, not by Adrian, not by Juliette, not by Vivienne.



I forced a smile, smooth and perfect. “Of course,” I said softly. “I understand completely.”



Vivienne tilted her head, faint surprise flickering. She expected tears. Rage. Collapse. Instead, I gave her poise.



But behind my smile, fire ignited.



They thought they had ended me.



They had no idea they had just created their worst nightmare.

Morning light spilled across the Delacroix penthouse, gilding every polished surface with a deceptive glow. From the outside, it was paradise: floor-to-ceiling glass, million-dollar art, and the illusion of harmony. But inside, something rotten pulsed beneath the marble floors.



I adjusted the strap of my silk dress in the mirror, forcing my reflection into perfection. Red lips precise, hair glossy, smile fixed. The kind of smile that says: I am fine. I am unshaken.



Downstairs, Juliette lounged on the sofa, draped in one of Adrian’s shirts as if it were a crown. Her bare legs stretched out over the cushions, a glass of green juice in hand. She didn’t even look up as I entered.



“Adrian prefers the curtains open in the morning,” she remarked, gesturing vaguely at the drawn drapes. “You should’ve known that by now.”



My nails bit into my palm. “You’re right,” I said smoothly. I crossed the room and pulled the curtains wide, flooding the space with sunlight that made her flinch. “Better, isn’t it?”



She smirked, but there was a flicker in her eyes—uncertainty. I stored it away like a gem.



By afternoon, I was trailing behind Vivienne Delacroix as she toured the Hamptons estate with her architects.



“The east wing will be remodeled for Juliette,” Vivienne declared, her tone crisp as glass. “A nursery, three bedrooms, staff quarters. Elena, you’ll coordinate with the designers.”



I nodded, jotting notes in a leather notebook. Perfect secretary. Perfect ghost.



“Yes, of course, Vivienne.”



She barely acknowledged me, too busy discussing wallpaper and imported chandeliers. But I wasn’t just writing notes. I was cataloguing every indulgence, every reckless decision. Evidence of greed. Evidence I could twist when the time came.



When Juliette paused to press a hand to her stomach, her smile coy, Vivienne’s eyes softened with pride.



“She’ll give us heirs,” Vivienne said loudly, so I wouldn’t miss a word.



I smiled sweetly, lips sharp as knives. “I hope for your sake it’s true.”



That night, I retreated into the sanctuary no one knew existed. Behind the false back of my walk-in closet lay a hidden room: walls covered with financial maps, contracts pinned with red thread, a web of connections only I understood.



I added a new file—an unsigned contract from Arthur Moreau, Juliette’s father. His company was bleeding money, desperate for a lifeline. I had drafted the lifeline. It looked like salvation, but it was a noose disguised in fine print.



Once he signed, the Moreau family would be in my debt. And debt, I knew, was sharper than any knife.



At dinner, Adrian appeared late, his tie askew, Juliette glowing by his side. He didn’t look at me as he poured himself a drink, didn’t notice the way my smile never faltered.



“Darling,” I said softly, sliding his glass across the table. “I took care of the estate plans today. Everything Juliette wants will be ready.”



Juliette smirked, but Adrian paused, suspicion flickering in his eyes.



“Good,” he said finally, drinking deeply.



They believed I was compliant. They believed I was broken.



But beneath the mask, I was sharpening my blade.



And soon, they would bleed.

\## Chapter 3



The next morning, I arranged lilies in a crystal vase on the breakfast table. Their perfume filled the air—sweet, intoxicating, almost suffocating. I adjusted a stem until it was perfectly aligned, because if my life had collapsed, at least the flowers would obey me.



Juliette swept into the room in a silk robe, her hair cascading like dark satin, her eyes gleaming with the kind of triumph only someone too foolish to fear can wear. She paused just long enough to ensure the staff had gathered within earshot, then pressed a hand against her stomach with theatrical precision.



“I have the most wonderful news,” she announced, her voice ringing like a bell. “Dr. Rutherford confirmed it yesterday. I’m pregnant. With twins.”



Gasps echoed around the room. Forks clattered against china. Even the butler froze.



I smiled, my hands steady as I poured myself coffee. “Twins,” I repeated softly. “How… efficient.”



Juliette preened, mistaking my calm for surrender. “Some women,” she added, her gaze locking on me with deliberate cruelty, “are simply destined for motherhood.”



Her words struck like a blade to the scar I’d carried for years—my infertility, the whispered shame I had endured in silence. For a moment, I thought my mask might crack. But I pressed the recorder in my pocket, its tiny red light glowing like a heartbeat, capturing every venomous syllable.



They would regret underestimating me.



That evening, Vivienne Delacroix presided over a formal dinner in the family’s marble dining hall. The chandeliers blazed, the wine sparkled, the servants moved in choreographed silence.



And Juliette sat beside Adrian, in my chair.



Halfway through the meal, she reached for her glass with exaggerated grace, her bracelet clinking against crystal. With a flick too precise to be an accident, she tipped her hand. Burgundy wine cascaded across the tablecloth, splattering my ivory silk gown.



“Oh dear!” she gasped, her performance flawless. “How clumsy of me. Elena, you really should sit straighter—posture matters so much.”



Laughter rippled from one corner of the table. Vivienne’s lips curved in satisfaction. Adrian didn’t even glance at me.



I dabbed delicately at the stain, lifting my eyes to Juliette with a smile that never touched my soul. “It’s fine,” I said evenly. “Some things can’t be replaced. Others…” I let the pause stretch, long enough for the silence to sharpen. “…are disposable.”



The room stilled. Juliette’s smirk faltered, just slightly. I savored it.



Two nights later, Adrian took me to his private club downtown. The scent of cigars and whiskey clung to the air, the low murmur of powerful men filling the paneled room. I sat quietly, the dutiful wife, sipping champagne while they laughed over stocks and scandals.



After his third glass of scotch, Adrian leaned toward his friend Charles, careless, arrogant, forgetting—or ignoring—that I was within earshot.



“Trading in an old model for a brand-new one,” he chuckled. “Elena was reliable, but Juliette? She’s the Ferrari. And she’ll give me heirs. Real heirs.”



Charles roared with laughter. “Twins, I hear? Impressive.”



Adrian raised his glass, pride oozing from every word. “Proof I made the right choice. Elena knows her place. That’s why she lasted this long.”



My smile never wavered. My hand rested casually on my clutch, where the recorder hummed, capturing every syllable.



They saw only what they wanted: a humiliated wife pretending to endure.



What they missed was the truth.



The mask I wore was not weakness. It was armor.



And soon, I would wield it like a blade.
