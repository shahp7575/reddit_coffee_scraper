1k3vben,https://i.redd.it/mxj71zcwp1we1.jpeg,Progress Pics: Hit my halfway goal and need some extra motivation from others who have made it happen <3,"30F and I have been doing ADF on and off for a year or so but I really made it a priority around 2.5 months ago. 

It feels amazing to finally lock into a routine this go around and I feel better mentally and physically. I do true every other day ADF with no calories on my fasting day (several days I'd have a coffee with almond milk or something similar just to get through). No extra exercise was added in, most days I get around 6000/7500 steps. 

150LB was my target halfway point, and I told myself I'd look at my progress photos for the first time when I hit that point to serve as a motivating push to keep going. 

I'd love to hear any tips or stories from this community for hitting the second half of the journey with some good motivation because this week has been the hardest for me by far (stress/work stuff which is always my hardest trigger to maneuver and led to my falling off the wagon in the past). 

I'd like to start incorporating more exercise now moving forward as well so any tips on that would be really appreciated <3 My goal weight is 125 so I'm exactly halfway now!",1,1745179760.0,AlternateDayFasting,0,1.0,False
1k3vb05,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1k3vb05/new_to_all_of_this_i_cant_seem_to_find_a_reason/,New to all of this. I can’t seem to find a reason why my adderall XR didn’t work today and it had the opposite effect it usually does.,"My period is over, it ended 9 days ago. I slept fine last night and got 7 and a half hours of good sleep. I ate but avoided vitamin C and such. I ate protein, and drank a cup of tea like I always do. I didn’t really do anything different. I drink tons of water.

Normally when I take it I’ll get a burst of energy for a couple of hours and get in the zone. I get all of my chores done for the day, meal prep for dinner, etc. I am not talking about euphoria, that went away a long time ago. I just feel more energetic for a bit like I drank a bunch of coffee. Thats been my experience for the past 2 months and 19 days. 

Today, I did the same. I wake up and drink a big glass of water and take my metformin and 30mg XR and I ate. I go take a shower and then come back to bed, it’s my favorite thing to do because my house is freezing. Instead of waking me up, it made me super sleepy. I waited and waited, I got out of bed. Still nothing. No focus, no in the zone. I felt exhausted and my family went to church, I skipped it today. I went back to bed and passed out for 2 hours. I woke up feeling like crap, super groggy.

(I checked to make sure I took the right pill, I did. I have a pill box)

I did take my booster dose and I feel a little better but I am a little concerned over it not working at all. Is this normal? I was just switched to 30mg not that long ago.

Any ideas?

We got coffee, walked around a park, and at one point started talking about our jobs (we’re both in tech).

Then she casually mentioned how she “hates Linux” and thinks it’s “needlessly complicated” and that “Windows just works.” I laughed, thinking she was joking—but nope, she was dead serious. She even made a comment about how “people who use Linux are just trying too hard to be different.”

I was stunned. I’ve been a Linux user for years, not just for work but in my personal life too. I love the philosophy behind it, the community, the control, the freedom. It’s a part of who I am. I didn’t make a scene, but honestly, after that I just kind of checked out mentally.

I didn’t text her back after the date, and I haven’t reached out since. A friend of mine said I was being ridiculous and that I’m gatekeeping an OS like it’s a personality trait. Another friend said I dodged a compatibility bullet.

We’ll be staying with family for a bit while we get settled and are starting to look at rentals.

But honestly… everything I’m seeing online looks either really average or ridiculously expensive for what it is.

So I’m hoping to get some suburb recommendations that suit our vibe:

About us:
	•	Early–mid 30s gay couple
	•	Family are based in the northern and western suburbs
	•	One of us will be working near Chermside
	•	We have a small dog
	•	We’re used to being able to walk to everything (Coles, great coffee, train/tram, gym etc.)
	•	We have 1 car

What we’re looking for:
	•	Minimum 2 bed, 1 car
	•	Ideally a modern townhouse, but would consider a dog-friendly apartment
	•	Air con is essential (bonus points for ducted)
	•	Modern finishes preferred
	•	Up to $850/week
	•	Close to shops, cafes, public transport
	•	Nice surrounds and a bit of community feel

What we’d like to avoid:
	•	Going back to the suburbs I grew up in (Chelmer, Graceville, Indro etc.)—keen to live somewhere new to me
	•	Isolated or purely car-dependent areas

It’s been over a decade since I lived in Brisbane, and I know the city has changed heaps. Keen to hear where people like us are living now, and which suburbs have really gentrified or come into their own.

Any help or advice would be so appreciated!

1k3v4v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1k3v4v0/im_so_fucking_done/,I'm so fucking done,"I (28M) wonder why I had to be born to these fucking psychopath narcissists I call parents. I hate my life, I hate that I chose a field of study that has a shit job market right now, I hate that I chose to move back and now I can't move out, I hate everything.

BEFORE ANYONE ASKS WHY I DON'T JUST LEAVE:

1. I've applied to minimum wage housing but my salary is just a tad above minimum wage but still low enough that I can't sustain myself financially.
2. I'm trying to find an engineering job but my field of study is fucking depressing in terms of acceptance rates so I'm working a barely minimum wage job atm.
3. I have shared housing with others in the past to save costs but ended up being harassed so bad I used violence to defend myself and I'm still wary of living with people.

I don't understand why it's so hard for them to leave me the fuck alone. Both of my parents are higher degrees of education but for how much weight they put on money, they never got anywhere in life with their degrees. My mom barely worked in her life with the excuse of ""taking care of the family"" but acts like she knows everything and is always right. My dad worked overseas so didn't really make much money. We live in a small as fuck house in the bad side of the city. Yet they both act like they would be the next Elon Musk if they were in my shoes and that I'm just incompetent. I'm working at a grocery store while I try to find an engineering job to become financially independent and yet all they do is pour cold water over my head every day and compare me to our neighbor around my age who has a wife and has a stable job as a contractor. Since they have nothing to do but stay at home all day, they're constantly on my case 24/7 from the time I leave for work to when I come back.

They also try to control all aspects of my life. They made it a point to take away all the joys I had previously. For example, the only thing I look forward to each day is a cup of coffee but recently my mom developed osteoperosis and now she's forbidding me from drinking coffee. At least if she sees coffee at home she will toss it or yell at me if she catches me drinking it. She also forces me to eat only the things she cooks and no outside food. I'm not a picky eater but her cooking is pretty horrendous. It's just steamed veggies for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with no oil or salt and she piles the plate like feeding a pig. I almost gag at the sheer amount of food she shoves in my plate. Meanwhile, they hide snacks in the drawer and eat them when I'm not around.

She also expects me to do things the moment she tells me to. If I ignore her or wait, she will start fuming and end up exploding at me. For example, I sat down after doing the dishes and she yells at me to go take out the trash, then gets mad exactly 1 minute later because I didn't go immediately. It's in no way a healthy relationship but she's been like this all her life from the time I was a kid. I grew up without any siblings to relate to and had to endure the constant emotional fear of her lashing out at me due to having a bad or stressful day. Yet she denies it all when I accuse her of it. My dad was never around since he was working overseas and barely talks to me anyways. How do you expect a child to grow up a normal person with this kind of household?

My dad was basically bullied into retiring from his job early and now stays at home all day bitter and just trying to point out my flaws to my mom and brainwash her into being more strict on me. I don't have any free time to myself. If he sees me relaxing playing games with people, he will restart the router and pretend nothing happened. He also set up cameras around the house to see if I'm eating food from the fridge when they're not around which is laughable because he has a bunch of snacks and eats the most in our house. He acts like a know-it-all and tries to correct everything I say even if I'm right. I honestly don't see him as a father rather than some annoying guy that lives in the house.

I feel so detached from life now. After several months of nonstop dealing with their berating and constant helicoptoring, I just cbf to live anymore. Whenever we go out with normal family members and they try to talk to me, I kind of just stare blankly into space and nod or shake my head to respond. I can't really bring myself to feel human with my own will with this kind of treatment at home. I've been getting really irritated and want to fight anyone and everyone, even if it's just some stranger that ticked me off. I've threatened my parents with violence several times when they were crossing boundaries and that made me feel really bad after. I just don't know what to do...

Like most people, my bowel habits were atrocious while drinking, but they were mostly predictable. If I drank Sour IPAs, High abv sugary canned cocktails, or wine, I'd without fail have diarrhea the next day. Seltzers and low abv beer and such rarely gave me problems. Hard liquor was a gamble.

Anyway, when i got sober I was looking forward to the expected gut ""cleanout"". Most people described having the runs during early sobriety and I was mentally prepared to be born again in a sense. However, thats NOT at all what happened. 

I did not have a proper bowl movement for a month. This was alarming since I was now eating 3 times a day to keep myself busy and healthy. Food went in, food did not come back out. At around the 5 week mark the gas was a public health concern it was so bad. Other than slight to moderate abdominal discomfort and diabolical flatulence, the experience wasn't too bad or concerning enough to seek professional help. I did however contemplate drinking numerous times just so I could relieve some of the pressure (literal abdominal pressure)😭.

But I am happy to report that after 40 something days the gears are turning again. Started out with softer messier BMs, and is slowly becoming the healthier less messy variety each day. 

I believe certain factors may have made me more susceptible to sober constipation than sober diarrhea. 1. I was diagnosed with IBS in my youth before I ever started drinking. I experienced periods of both diarrhea and constipation, but I always leaned more towards the constipation side. 2. I basically stopped drinking water after getting sober. While drinking, I'd binge around 64 oz of alcohol (mostly seltzers), and drink 2 large 40 oz water bottles a day just to deal with the dehydration and hangovers. Now, I'll have maybe 40-60 oz of fluid a day split between NA seltzers, coffee, energy drinks (i know the lack of water is a problem and I'm trying to work on it).

I guess I felt called to make this post since I didn't really find many posts discussing sobriety and constipation while I was struggling. I just want the next sober person who can't shit to know they aren't alone and they'll get through it if they just ride it out.

I'm looking for someone respectful, punctual, responsible, quiet, and clean. The unit is fully furnished with a bed, bar table, desk, and closet hangers, but I am planning to move my furniture at the end of the lease (so if you extend you'd have to get new furniture then).

## Understanding the Landscape: Key Features & ⁤Benefits

Before diving ‌into specific recommendations, let's explore the features and benefits that define the best magnet​ cases for phones‌ in 2025:

*  ‍ **Secure Magnetic Attachment:** This is the non-negotiable⁢ feature. The best‍ cases utilize powerful magnets strategically placed to ensure a rock-solid connection with compatible accessories. Look for cases that boast ⁣a “strong magnet phone case” or “secure magnetic attachment” in their description.

*   **MagSafe Compatibility:** While ""magnetic phone ‍case vs‍ magsafe"" is a ‌common search term, it's‌ important to understand the nuances. MagSafe⁢ is Apple's ​proprietary magnetic technology,but many third-party cases offer MagSafe‍ compatibility,allowing⁤ them to work seamlessly with ‌MagSafe chargers and accessories. If you're an Apple user, prioritize a ""magsafe compatible case.""

*   **Protection:** A magnetic phone case is still‌ a phone case, and it needs to protect your device from ⁣the rigors ​of daily life. ⁢Look ⁤for cases that ‍are ""magnetic shockproof phone case"", ""rugged magnetic phone case"", or ""durable magnetic phone case"". Features like raised edges, reinforced corners, and impact-resistant materials are crucial.

*   **Wireless Charging Compatibility:** Ensure the case doesn't block or interfere with wireless charging. A ""wireless ⁣charging compatible magnetic case"" will allow you⁢ to charge your‍ phone effortlessly without removing the case.

*   **Design⁣ and Style:** While functionality is paramount, aesthetics ⁤matter too. Magnet⁢ cases come ⁢in a ⁢variety of styles, from sleek and minimalist to rugged and tactical. Choose a case that complements your personal style and reflects your individual needs. Consider a ""magnetic clear phone case"" to show off your phone's design while still enjoying the benefits of magnetic attachment. Or for those clumsy ⁤among us there is the ""anti gravity case"" which can stick to smooth flat surfaces.

*   **Ease of Installation:** A‌ good magnetic case‌ should be easy to install and remove without damaging your phone. An ""easy install magnetic case"" will save​ you time‍ and ‌frustration.

## Navigating⁣ the Market: Phone Models & Compatibility

The magnetic phone case ⁤market has expanded to cater to⁢ a wide range of phone models. Whether you're an iPhone aficionado, a ⁤Samsung loyalist, or a Pixel ⁣enthusiast, you can find a suitable magnetic case.

*   **iPhone Models:** The ""iphone [model] magnetic case"" is a popular search term, reflecting ⁢the demand for MagSafe-compatible‌ cases ‍for iPhones. ⁣From the latest iPhone 15 Pro Max to older models, ‍there are numerous options available.

*‌   **Samsung Models:** The ""samsung [model] magnetic case"" market is also ⁤thriving,with cases designed⁤ to fit⁣ a variety of Samsung Galaxy devices. These cases often incorporate strong magnets for compatibility ⁤with universal magnetic car mounts and other accessories.

*   **Pixel Models:**​ Although the Pixel line ‍isn't always first to receive accessories, ""pixel [model] ⁣magnetic ⁣case"" options are increasing. Look for cases designed specifically for ‌your Pixel ​model to ensure a perfect fit and⁢ optimal magnetic performance.*   **Universal Magnetic Phone Cases:** While model-specific cases ‍offer the best fit and performance, ""universal magnetic phone case"" ​solutions‌ exist, ⁢typically involving​ magnetic plates or adapters that attach to​ the back of your existing case. While these may offer‍ broader compatibility, they might not provide​ the same level of security and integration as dedicated magnetic cases.

I recently bought a MuscleBlaze pre-workout supplement in a blueberry blast flavor (or something similar). I don't take it 6 days a week, just on leg days, which is twice, and one more time when I don't feel like going to the gym or my body feels weak. I take it just for the energy boost. My workout routine remains the same. 

The problem is, whenever I take it, whether it's on leg day or a casual day, I feel like vomiting during the gym session and my heartbeat goes crazy fast. The gym session itself goes smoothly, but I'm wondering if others experience this too or if I have some issue with caffeine or the flavor. I don't take a full scoop, just half or a bit more. I used to have Nescafe coffee pouch before, and my friend introduced me to this pre-workout supplement one day. I didn't experience any issues like vomiting or rapid heartbeat that day, which is why I bought it. Is there any solution for this vomiting problem?",2,1745178656.0,Fitness_India,0,1.0,False
1k3uwf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1k3uwf5/trying_to_find_identity_outside_my_mom_and/,Trying to find identity outside my mom and boyfriend,"I really only hang with my parents and my boyfriend. I have friends but live in a prominent city, things are pretty expensive lately and I am a full time student. Just yesterday I went to the grocery store and bought 2 Red Bulls for studying late at night, a 5lb sack of mandarin oranges, and a party size bag of chips and the total came up to $28. I almost couldn’t believe it. I have friends but I can’t afford to hangout with them, as one lives very far away (about 45-50 minutes) and the other is always working. Even when we can go out it takes money to enjoy happy hours, dinners, lounges and the lot, and every dollar I have goes to bills.

I’m stressed with school. I’m in between jobs, and have an underlying feeling that I’m failing my parents by not helping take the burden of my life off them. Whenever I need help they are who I lean on, and I was handling my self up until the beginning of April when I left my job. I couldn’t focus on school and work, and I decided to take April to just focus on finishing the semester and then go back to work mid may since I had already invested so much in school and couldn’t afford to have it go to waste at the very end of the semester.

With the circumstances being what they are, almost all of my days are spent alone in my apartment. Most of the days I sleep in late, and stay up late wishing I could contribute more to take the burden off my parents. I know I should study, I know I should journal, that I should pray, and read, and take walks in the sun, but instead I just sit on my couch most of the time. I don’t really eat, because I have no income coming in and don’t want to further burden my family. I have mandarin oranges here and there, cups of coffee, cups of tea, bowls of grapes, later I’ll be having boiled rice with butter.

Idk. I just feel kind of stuck. I know things will get better, I know what I can do right now to make them better. But it’s like I can’t start. I sit in my living room with the tv off on the couch on my phone, and think of how my life is passing me by. I don’t expect anyone to have the answer, but often it’s just me and God, so I just wanted to vent. I have decided to not see my boyfriend until next month. I’ve been leaning on him a lot since I don’t really see my friends and don’t have to spend money to spend time with my boyfriend. I could invite friends to my apartment but they do always end up wanting to “go somewhere” after a bit of hanging out, plus I’m not in a place to go out anyway knowing all the responsibilities I have to check off my list. Right now I am trying to work on being a full whole person outside of a daughter or someone’s girlfriend. I have things to do but I procrastinate and worry about how scared I am of failing at trying to do them, and what that will mean for the people around me whom I love.

I know from this one post I may come off as a bum, an adult who is a burden to their parents, someone who is helpless - maybe beyond help, or too lazy to help themselves.. and I wouldn’t blame anyone for thinking that based off this post. I am a girl in her early 20s. But I have done a lot of commendable things, I moved out and supported myself for years, earlier than half of my peers. I always supported and contributed to my parents lives in meaningful ways when I had extra income to spare. I was never stingy. I may have not worked at full capacity 100% of the time at my jobs, but if I had 70% to give - I gave all 70%. If I had 60% to give, I gave the whole 60% at my jobs. If I had 100%, I gave 100%. And the days I had 40%, I gave 40% and apologized to management and made sure they knew that today was just an off day and I know that I am expected to perform regardless of “life” and that I absolutely will perform, and I did, I was always better and earnestly putting my best foot forward the next day.

I am more than my current shortcomings, but life isn’t about what you’ve done, it’s about what you’ve done *lately*.

Graven Hollow wasn’t on any map I had. My GPS blinked out right after my car coughed its last breath near the rusted town sign. I thought it would be the perfect place to shoot some eerie B-roll for the documentary I was working on. Forgotten towns always have good bones for horror stories.

But this one… this place felt wrong.

The people stared too long and spoke too little. When I asked about the clock tower at the town square—the one looming like a spine through the fog—they tensed up. One woman, eyes cloudy like old milk, took my arm and whispered, “Don’t stay awake when it chimes thirteen.”

I laughed. Thirteen? It sounded like a ghost story. Exactly what I came for.

That night, I set up my equipment in the square. Cameras. Audio recorders. Notebooks. I wanted to catch the full chime sequence on tape. Document the mystery.

Midnight approached. The air grew thick, like syrup in my lungs. The town was silent. No bugs, no wind, not even the sound of my own breath.

Then—BONG.

The first chime hit like a slap. Sharp. Echoing.

BONG.

The second, deeper. Almost mournful.

They kept coming. Each one a little more off. Warped. Out of tune. Like the bell was slowly rusting from the inside out.

BONG. Eleven.

BONG. Twelve.

And then, it happened.

BONG. Thirteen.

Everything snapped.

My ears rang. My vision twisted like an old VHS tape warping mid-play. I felt like I was falling inside myself.

Then—I woke up.

Same motel room. Coffee was hot again. My equipment untouched. My notes… blank.

The clock read 11:57 p.m.

I thought I’d dreamed it. Until it happened again.

And again.

And again.

I tried everything—leaving town, smashing the tower, hiding in the woods. But no matter what I did, I always ended up back in that room, three minutes before midnight. And every time, I remembered more. Every time, the chimes got closer.

I started seeing things—shadows in mirrors that didn’t belong, townspeople who blinked too slow, grinned too wide. Eventually, I stopped hearing their voices. They just… mouthed things at me. Like they knew I couldn’t hear over the ringing.

By the twenty-seventh loop, I knew I wasn’t alone anymore.

Something stood at the base of the tower during each thirteenth chime. A tall, faceless thing in tattered black robes. Watching. Waiting. It stepped closer every time.

One night, I snapped. During the thirteenth chime, I screamed. I shouted over it, cursed the tower, begged anything to set me free.

And it did.

I woke up in a new motel, in a new town. The clock on the nightstand blinked.

11:57 p.m.

The coffee was warm. My notes were blank. The air was still.

I laughed. Cried. Thought I made it out.

Until I heard it again—faint and distant:

BONG.

The first of thirteen.

I didn’t escape the loop.

I just found another one.

And now that you’ve read this, I need to ask:

What time is it?
Did you hear it too?

For those of you who haven’t heard of it before, Dune Weaver is a kinetic sand table that creates mesmerizing patterns using a marble that moves on a sand bed.

I spent the last couple of months working on this and you can build one right now with me if you want to. For now, the model is available for a fee on my Patreon page (https://patreon.com/duneweaver) for early supporters, and I plan to release the model for free later this year.

The Dune Weaver Pro is a 75-cm fully functioning coffee table that will impress anyone who looks at it. The table is powered by two stepper motors and 3d printed gears that control the angular and radial movements of a magnet. This magnet will move a magnetic marble on a surface with sand, which in turn creates stunning patterns. This isn’t just a piece of furniture; it’s a conversation starter, a source of relaxation after your long day, and a fantastic project to learn new skills. We’d be working with 3D printed parts, motors, electronics, Raspberry Pi, and DLC32 and deploying code to these devices. The project costs me $250 Canadian dollars, but your mileage may vary, depending on what you have on hand.

I also made a 30+ mins assembly video if anyone is interested: https://youtu.be/nrPQD5zwBiU

It SUCKED.

So, we bootstrapped a tool to help us automate Linkedin engagement. No VC cash, just ramen, late nights, and a LOT of caffeine. We focused purely on solving that core pain point we knew inside and out from our own clients.

If you're a new founder, consider doing what I did: sell service, find common problem, build product and sell it to your service clients.

Launched last year. Our ""marketing plan""?
1.  Tell our existing network/clients.
2.  Some very targeted outreach (no spam cannons here).
3.  Pray to the organic growth gods.

We honestly thought we'd maybe get a handful of users, maybe hit $1-2k MRR if we were lucky.

Fast forward to this month: We just crossed $23,000/month in recurring revenue, near ZERO churn so far.

I'll repeat what we all know already, build something people actually need, solve a real pain point, and you might not need a million-dollar ad budget (at least initially).

Building Ingagenow is awesome, and we want it to be HUGE because we genuinely believe it helps people. My goal is to get to make enough money so I can spend time with the family, just be present. I don't need nine figures for that and this product is a big step towards it.

In January, after receiving positive feedback on my newspaper editorial, [***Oakland Needs More Than a New Mayor***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DgbeeYzpXILG8IwY5_Jn_6shatb-AaQX/view?usp=sharing), Ben Gould, Nancy Falk, and I launched the Oakland Charter Reform Project. We spent the first few months listening to Oaklanders share their views about city government.

We convened three focus groups that included Planning Commissioners, former city employees, members of the League of Women Voters, SPUR, the Oakland Chamber of Commerce, the Port of Oakland, neighborhood associations, bike and pedestrian advocates, and other influential, long-time Oakland observers. We also met with the leadership of the Oakland NAACP, reached out to the City Council and met personally with six members, presented at a SPUR community forum, gathered feedback on social media, and spoke with everyone who reached out to us.

In all, we have engaged with about **200 people since January**.

**What Have We Learned?**

Every single stakeholder—many with decades of experience working with or inside Oakland city government—told us the same thing: Oakland’s flawed City Charter is **largely, if not entirely, responsible** for the City’s dysfunction. In summary:

* There is **broad dissatisfaction** with Oakland's current condition and government structure. [**Seventy-nine percent of Oakland voters believe Oakland is on the wrong track**](https://eastbayinsiders.substack.com/p/new-poll-shows-taylor-leading-lee).  
* There is **consensus** that the charter is poorly designed and **near-unanimous agreement** that it can and should be improved.  
* There is **agreement** that Oakland needs a structure that better empowers elected and appointed leaders to do their jobs effectively.

**Where Are We Now?**

**We have decided to move forward with a ballot initiative** to update Oakland’s charter to a [**Council-Manager form of government**](https://icma.org/sites/default/files/Council-Manager%20Form%20Brochure%20%28FINAL%29%2010-2019.pdf)**.**  

Under our proposal:

* Oakland’s elected **Mayor will serve as a member of the City Council** and preside as its chair.  
* The **Council and Mayor** will work together to appoint, supervise, set goals for, and evaluate the performance of a professionally trained **City Administrator** and **City Attorney**.

Why choose the Council-Manager model over the alternative Mayor-Council (aka “strong mayor”) form?  Because research shows that the unitary Council-Manager system is more [**transparent**](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24639088?), [**responsive**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280915640_What_Have_We_Learned_about_the_Performance_of_Council-Manager_Government_A_Review_and_Synthesis_of_the_Research)**,** [**effective, efficient**](https://icma.org/blog-posts/professional-management-drives-local-government-efficiency-and-effectiveness)**,** [**fiscally responsible**](https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article-abstract/30/1/161/5544095), and [**less corrupt**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/puar.13050) than the Mayor-Council form.  

That’s why [**97% of California’s cities use it**](https://www.commoncause.org/california/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/california-municipal-key-findings.pdf).  That’s why [**most large American cities use it**](https://icma.org/sites/default/files/Council-Manager%20Form%20Brochure%20%28FINAL%29%2010-2019.pdf).  That’s why [**every California city comparable in size to Oakland uses it**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LNVpjVzk8EPvYwNDz549SVN-fenxsT1X/view?usp=sharing). And that’s why the National Civic League promotes it in its [**Model City Charter**](https://www.nationalcivicleague.org/model-city-charter-9th-edition/).  

Simply put:  **the Council-Manager form of government is a better system for most cities.**

Also, this isn’t new for Oakland. The city **successfully operated under a Council-Manager system for 65 years**, until Measure X replaced it in 1998 with today’s flawed ""Weak Mayor"" system.  

**What’s Next?**  

**We’ve drafted a ballot measure** and are now reviewing it with charter law experts to ensure it’s legally sound. 

**We’ve requested meetings with the City Attorney, City Clerk, and Mayor-elect** to gather their input.

Based on what we learn, **we aim to release the final ballot language within the next 60 days.** After that, we’ll begin collecting the signatures needed to qualify for the June 2026 ballot, thus resolving the charter matter *before* candidates file for the November 2026 mayoral election.

1k3ur1s,https://i.redd.it/kyojnexnj1we1.jpeg,"Extra Qi Gems, Gold, and Quest Reward Items via Local Co-op (PS4/console).","Not sure if this is widely known or utilized, but if you are playing on a console that supports local co-op (PS4 in my case), and you have a spare controller and account, you can receive twice the rewards for quests. This includes gold, Qi Gems, and the various items you get from villagers as rewards (like the coffee maker or espresso maker). 

To set this up, you just need to visit Robin and get a spare cabin (or multiple if you want lots of these extra rewards), then start up a local co-op and have a different account join (one per cabin). Then after you start up a quest, have that account join while the quest is still active and then have them join again once it's complete. This especially nice for Qi quests like ""Qi Crops"" that gives 100 Qi Gems for each account you join your save with during the quest.

I think the reward items that come in the mail are sent to the other accounts regardless of whether or not they join during the active quest, as I had one account join late game and it had a ton of mail immediately upon joining the first time with all of the accumulated reward items.

You can even have those accounts upgrade their cabins at Robin to get the cellars giving you much more casks to age artisan goods with and full sized houses to decorate.",1,1745178159.0,StardewValley,0,1.0,False

In January, after receiving positive feedback on my newspaper editorial, [***Oakland Needs More Than a New Mayor***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DgbeeYzpXILG8IwY5_Jn_6shatb-AaQX/view?usp=sharing), Ben Gould, Nancy Falk, and I launched the Oakland Charter Reform Project. We spent the first few months listening to Oaklanders share their views about city government.

We convened three focus groups that included Planning Commissioners, former city employees, members of the League of Women Voters, SPUR, the Oakland Chamber of Commerce, the Port of Oakland, neighborhood associations, bike and pedestrian advocates, and other influential, long-time Oakland observers. We also met with the leadership of the Oakland NAACP, reached out to the City Council and met personally with six members, presented at a SPUR community forum, gathered feedback on social media, and spoke with everyone who reached out to us.

In all, we have engaged with about **200 people since January**.

1k3ujps,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k3ujps/my_neighbor_keeps_talking_to_someone_who_isnt/,"My neighbor keeps talking to someone who isn’t there. Last night, I heard them answer back","I moved into this neighborhood at the end of January. I was looking for quiet, space, and—if I’m being honest—a reset. I’d just left the city after a breakup, a burnout, and a year I’d rather not relive. The town I landed in isn’t the kind that shows up in travel guides. It’s the kind with rusted-out mailboxes, lawn flamingos, and the faint sound of a radio playing from someone’s garage.

My house is small. Just two bedrooms and a porch that creaks when I lean on the railing. But it’s mine. And for the first time in a while, I felt like I could breathe again.

That feeling lasted all of two weeks.

The first time I noticed Mr. Talbot, it was raining. I was drinking coffee at the window, watching the street disappear behind streaks of water, when I caught sight of him across the road. He was standing in his living room, perfectly still, staring directly out his front window. His lights were off. No TV. No movement. Just him and the dark behind him.

I waved—instinct, I guess—but he didn’t respond. Just turned and walked out of sight.

I figured he didn’t see me. Or maybe he was hard of hearing. Or maybe he just didn’t care. I mean, people keep to themselves out here. That’s part of the appeal, right?

Still, after that, I started noticing more.

Every evening, just after the streetlights buzzed to life, Mr. Talbot would settle into the same old armchair near his window. Same spot. Same time. Always facing the corner of the room, where there was… nothing. No TV. No bookshelves. Just a blank wall and a dusty lamp that never turned on.

And every night, I’d see his lips move. Slow, deliberate. Like he was explaining something.

At first, I assumed he was talking to someone on the phone. Maybe an old friend. Maybe his wife, if he had one. But I never saw anyone come in or out of that house. No visitors. No cars in the driveway. Not even a dog or cat wandering around inside.

Just Mr. Talbot. Alone. Talking to someone I couldn’t see.

I tried to ignore it. Told myself it wasn’t my business. Maybe he was just eccentric. Or maybe it helped him feel less alone.

But about a week ago, something changed.

It was around 11 p.m., later than I usually stay up. I couldn’t sleep—too many thoughts running in circles—so I sat by the window, sipping on lukewarm tea, and glanced across the street out of habit.

Mr. Talbot was in his chair again.

Only this time… he wasn’t talking.

He was listening.

His head tilted slightly to one side, like a child watching a puppet show. His eyes were locked on that same blank corner of the room. And his mouth hung open, like he was in awe—or fear. I couldn’t tell which.

I squinted through the glass, trying to see if maybe someone was there. Maybe he finally had company.

That’s when he nodded. Slowly. Twice. Then leaned forward in his chair and whispered something I couldn’t hear.

He stayed like that for maybe ten minutes. Then stood up, walked out of the room, and didn’t return.

I waited. Maybe fifteen minutes. Maybe more. Then finally, I gave up and went to bed.

I told myself to stop watching him. It felt wrong, invasive. But you know how your brain fixates on something? Like a loose thread you just have to tug?

Last night, I tugged the thread.

And it unravelled.

I didn’t plan to watch him again. I told myself I was done.

But sometime around 10:30, I found myself back at the window.

No tea. No excuse. Just standing there like a moth drawn to something I didn’t understand.

Mr. Talbot’s house was dark.

No porch light. No living room lamp. Just the dim glow of a streetlight casting long shadows across his lawn.

But he was there. I could make out the silhouette of his armchair. His figure. That same tilt of his head. Facing the corner.

He was talking again.

I leaned in, pressing my forehead lightly to the glass. I didn’t even realize I was holding my breath.

Then something… shifted.

His posture changed. His shoulders pulled back like he was startled. His hands gripped the arms of the chair. And slowly—too slowly—he turned his head toward the window.

Toward me.

Our eyes met.

At least, I think they did. The distance made it hard to tell. But I felt it. Like a pinprick behind my eyes.

He wasn’t looking at me. He was looking through me.

And then—he smiled.

It wasn’t warm. It wasn’t polite. It was the kind of smile you see in dreams that make you wake up cold and sweating.

He lifted one hand and pointed. Not at the corner. Not at the window.

At me.

Then, I swear—I heard it.

Not through the glass. Not through the air. But somewhere else. Inside.

A voice. Low. Calm. Familiar, in the way a shadow under your bed is familiar.

It said:

“He sees you.”

My legs buckled. I stumbled backward, heart pounding so hard I thought I might black out.

When I scrambled to the window again, the chair was empty.

Mr. Talbot was gone.

The light flicked on a second later.

Nothing moved.

I haven’t slept since.

This morning, I watched the house all through sunrise. No sign of him. No signs of life at all. But something tells me… I wasn’t supposed to see that.

And I’m starting to think Mr. Talbot wasn’t talking to someone who isn’t there.

He was warning them.

About me.

I haven’t seen Mr. Talbot since that night.

His chair’s still there. His lights still flicker on at sunset. But the man himself?

Gone.

I keep thinking about that voice. About what it said.

“He sees you.”

I used to think I was the one watching him.

But now… I’m not so sure I ever was.

| 3 Achiever | Being worthless → Value | Relentless execution, charisma | Image addiction, workaholism | Slides to 9 (numb drift) | Learns 6 cooperation |
| 4 Individualist | Being ordinary → Identity | Creative depth, authenticity radar | Self‑sabotage, envy loops | Slides to 2 (clingy giving) | Learns 1 discipline |

Ⅱ.  The 16 MBTI Types (cognitive focus & common derailers)

| MBTI | Cognitive “Pilot” | Natural Edge | Typical Trip‑Wire |
|------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| ISTJ | Si‑Te | Procedural mastery | Rigidity, nit‑picking |
| ISFJ | Si‑Fe | Quiet caretaking | Over‑accommodation |
| INFJ | Ni‑Fe | Strategic empathy | Martyrdom, secrecy |
| INTJ | Ni‑Te | Systems vision | Impatience, aloofness |
| ISTP | Ti‑Se | Tactical troubleshooting | Emotional negligence |
| ISFP | Fi‑Se | Experiential artistry | Conflict avoidance |
| INFP | Fi‑Ne | Idealistic creativity | Self‑inconsistency |
| INTP | Ti‑Ne | Abstract synthesis | Analysis paralysis |
| ESTP | Se‑Ti | Real‑time action | Recklessness |
| ESFP | Se‑Fi | Live‑wire engagement | Impulse spending |
| ENFP | Ne‑Fi | Possibility ignition | Over‑commitment |
| ENTP | Ne‑Ti | Idea sparring | Provocation addiction |
| ESTJ | Te‑Si | Operational leadership | Steam‑rollering |
| ESFJ | Fe‑Si | Social logistics | Boundary blindness |
| ENFJ | Fe‑Ni | Inspiring mentorship | Image management |
| ENTJ | Te‑Ni | Strategic execution | Workaholic dominance |



Ⅲ.  Where the Maps Overlap (probability ≠ prescription)

> Rule of thumb: functions (MBTI) describe how you process, Enneagram describes why you act.

| Likely Enneagram Cluster | Dominant MBTI Pool | Rationale |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| 1 / 5 / 6 | ISTJ, INTJ, ISTP, ISFJ | Detail or risk‑focused cognition pairs with duty/competence motives |
| 2 / 3 / 8 | ENFJ, ENTJ, ESTJ, ESFJ | Extraverted Judging seeks impact, fits helper/achiever/power drives |
| 4 / 7 / 9 | INFP, ENFP, ISFP, ESFP | Experience‑driven perceivers match identity, variety, harmony motives |
| Wild cards | INTP, ENTP, INFJ | Broad mental range; can land almost anywhere (commonly 4, 5, 6) |

Use as a starting hypothesis; confirm with motivations, not test scores.



Ⅳ.  Conversation Fuel (steal these for the comments)

1. Most constructive pairing you’ve seen IRL (e.g., 8 × 2 business duo, 4 × 9 marriage).  
2. Type‑specific growth hack that actually worked—not a quote, an experience.  
3. Biggest clash: which MBTI–Enneagram combo seems inherently contradictory?  
4. Science skeptics: what would falsify these models for you? (Double‑blind study? fMRI?)  
5. If you could switch types for 24 h, which and why?



Ⅴ.  Frequently Thrown Tomatoes (pre‑emptive answers)

 “This is pseudoscience.” Correct—no peer‑reviewed predictive power yet. Frameworks ≈ mental mirrors: helpful for self‑audit, awful for hiring decisions.  
 “MBTI is binary; people are spectra.” True; traits sit on continua. MBTI is a categorical shortcut, nothing more.  
 “Percentages are wrong!” Every source differs; online data over‑represents 4s & 5s, under‑represents 8s & some SJs. The spread above is an average of the biggest public samples—treat it as directional.

Got Turkish coffee that had milk in it? I’ve never had it before and was curious to try it. When I looked it up later, to my surprise, it’s something very different from what I had.

We’ve had a great relationship with the usual bumps. He gamed when we met as teens and still does, but now saying he’ll likely never stop.His current favorite game he’s been on 6+ months. He’s spent $1,000+ on it and plays 10–14 hours some days. I hate to mention the money because I get Botox, hair done, etc.things that make me feel good. I try to see both sides and genuinely question if I’m wrong to be upset. We’ve been trying for a baby 6 months. In month 1, I caught him talking to someone from the game. I overheard him during a “meeting” in-game being oddly sweet to her. He deleted Discord in a panic when I asked to see his phone. After back and forth, he showed me: they’d talked for 2 months. Not every day, never sexual, no pet names, but it felt inappropriate. He sent her sunset videos while at work, videos of it snowing, teased her, shared dog pics.
And honestly, I don’t believe it’s because he’s not getting enough from me. I check in on our marriage. I’ve always let him golf, fish, game, spend money. I work full time, make as much or more, cook, clean, pack his lunch, initiate intimacy almost every other day. He hasn’t done laundry or cleaned in years. I don’t want praise, that’s just who I am!

After I found out, he agreed to delete Discord off his phone and just use it while gaming. She was blocked. But then he started secretly downloading Discord again to check game stuff. Said it was important. He wasn’t talking to her. I said fine keep it but I want it logged in on my phone too. He agreed. She’s still blocked, so I try to move past it.

He works long shifts and says gaming is his “escape.” I don’t want to take a hobby away. But the other day, he said he’ll never stop gaming and if I didn’t like it, “pack my bags and get out.” I had allergies that day and he thought I was crying. He laughed, said “yeah, I doubt it.” Typical—he always laughs if I cry in arguments. I said I wanted him to find a hobby that betters him, have a routine, not stay up till 3am. One guy he plays with is a real life friend who’s awful cheats, does illicits, etc. I don’t like the influence. 

He wakes up, checks his phone for an hour, asks me for coffee, logs into his computer. Doesn’t eat unless I make or suggest it. Says I need to tell him what chores to do or “he doesn’t know.” Meanwhile, I wake up, clean, take the dog out, plan my day before work.

Because I wanted him to game less and build better habits, he calls me stupid, said I’d fail at anything else if I didn’t choose my job. It’s always like this: I bring up a problem, he insults me, I beg him to stop being cruel.

Is It Just Me or Does It Get Better?","As the title says, I know I’m still young, but sometimes it really hits me, I’ve never had a girlfriend, and it’s starting to get to me.

I’m 20M, and I’ve been into martial arts for years. I was super consistent with Judo and Boxing when I was younger, and for the past few years, I’ve become kind of gym-obsessed: in the healthiest way possible (I also never talk about it really because I don't wanna annoy people with some of my stuff). I eat clean, train hard, still do Judo once a week, and shadowbox few times a week just out of love for the sport. I’ve never been fat in my life, and now I’m in the best shape I’ve ever been. I’m sitting at around 13-14% body fat with a visible 4-pack, probably a 6-pack if I cut a bit more.

Friends always tell me I look really good. They say I’ve got that Jaime Lannister Season 1 hairstyle and jawline, and they joke about it all the time. But the one thing I’m unsure about is my *face*. I sometimes wonder if they’re just being nice to me when they say I’m attractive—like, am I actually good-looking or are they just hyping me up because they’re close friends?

Socially, I keep my circle small but loyal. I’ve got 4–5 close friends I can open up to, and a few more I don’t hang with often but still trust. One of them’s a girl, but she’s more of a homie. I like it this way—real, deep connections over large groups.

Career-wise, I’m a freelance video editor and I’m building a business I’m super passionate about. I’ve carved a path I love—I don’t go to college, I work on my own terms, and I’m genuinely happy with that side of my life.

But dating? That’s where it hurts. I’ve asked a few girls out in the past, not often, but enough to feel the sting. Most went nowhere. The last one said yes, then canceled on me *three* times. She even rescheduled herself a couple more times, only to cancel again every single time. Eventually, I had enough and blocked her.

The girls who do seem interested? Not my type. I’m not into the party/drinking/clubbing scene. I want something real. I’m a big film and game nerd who loves working out, reading (mostly fiction, some science and biology now and then), and chill spots—coffee places, gyms, movie nights, libraries, or book clubs. Nothing wild.

Watching *Invincible* Season 3 lately, especially the Mark & Eve scenes... just made it worse. That kind of deep connection is something I crave more than anything. Someone to understand me, and someone I can *truly* open up to beyond what even my close friends know.

My friends keep saying, “you’ll find the right one,” but when you’ve never even had a taste of it, it’s hard not to feel like something’s off.  
So I’m just throwing this out there:  
Does it ever get better?
Anyone else feel this way? What helped you?

- any advice will be appricated :)

_____________

**TL;DR:** 
- 20M, fit (Judo, boxing, gym-obsessed), healthy lifestyle, never been overweight  
- Friends say I look like Jaime Lannister S1, I think I look good too, but not 100% sure if my face is actually attractive  
- Freelance editor, building a business I love, don’t go to college by choice  
- Never had a girlfriend, asked a few girls out but it usually goes nowhere (last one kept flaking)  
- I’m not into clubbing/hookups—just want a real, deep connection like Mark & Eve in Invincible

If you’ve ever thought about building your own Bitcoin bot—one that can automate payments, collect tips, or act as a personal crypto assistant—this is the article for you. And no, we’re not talking about one of those complicated AI trading bots that eats up your weekend. We’re talking about a fun, smart, and simple bot that uses Bitcoin QR codes to make your wallet do things you didn’t know it could.

Let’s walk through how to build your own Bitcoin super bot using a clever tool that makes your life easier: the **Bitcoin QR Code API**. It's fast, lightweight, and you can get started in minutes. Whether you want a tip bot, a donation collector, or just an automated BTC assistant that looks cool, this is the way.

# What Is a Bitcoin Super Bot?

A Bitcoin super bot isn’t just a fancy idea—it’s a useful digital tool. Think of it as a helper that can do things with your Bitcoin wallet without needing constant attention. For example, it can:

* Instantly generate QR codes for your Bitcoin address
* Accept payments or donations on demand
* Share payment links with friends, customers, or followers
* Handle Bitcoin transactions in a clean, user-friendly way

You decide where your bot lives. It could work on a website, inside a messaging app, or even be part of a point-of-sale setup for a small business or side hustle. The main goal is to automate tasks around receiving Bitcoin, using QR codes as the trigger.

# Why Use QR Codes?

If you’ve spent time in the Bitcoin world, you know QR codes are everywhere. They’re a simple way to share payment information. Instead of copying and pasting a long address, users just scan and send. It’s faster, cleaner, and reduces the risk of errors.

Using a QR code in your bot allows you to create a smooth user experience. Someone wants to pay you? Send them a QR code. They scan it, approve the transaction, and the payment is done. No typing. No hassle.

# Introducing the Bitcoin QR Code API

The [Bitcoin QR Code API](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/) is the engine behind our bot idea. It’s a tool that lets you generate Bitcoin QR codes on demand, with full control over what they contain.

With this API, you can create:

* A simple QR code that links to your Bitcoin address
* A payment QR code with a specific amount, label, or message
* Custom QR codes for different situations: tips, sales, events, or fundraising

You can use it without signing up, and the output is instant. It’s great for developers and non-developers alike.

# What Can Your Bot Do?

Now that you’ve got a way to generate QR codes automatically, it’s time to think about what your bot should actually do. Here are some ideas to get you started:

# 1. Tip Bot

This is one of the easiest and most useful bots you can build. Share a QR code that points to your Bitcoin address, with an optional message like “Buy me a coffee.” You can change the amount or label depending on the platform or context.

You could use this in group chats, forums, or livestreams. Someone appreciates your work? They scan and tip you. Simple.

# 2. Donation Collector

Running a charity, project, or just looking to crowdfund something? Set your bot to generate a donation QR code on demand. Add custom labels like “Support the Project” or “Donate to the Mission.”

You could also rotate between multiple addresses or campaigns, depending on where you want the funds to go.

# 3. Payment Assistant

If you sell digital products or services, your bot can automatically send customers a Bitcoin payment request with a QR code. When they pay, you send them access or deliver the product.

This can be integrated with email responses, messaging bots, or website popups. No need for a complex e-commerce system.

# 4. Pop-up Sales and Events

Let’s say you’re selling something in person or running a booth. Your bot can display a scannable QR code with a set amount for each item. Customers scan, pay, and walk away with their purchase. Fast and cashless.

This is great for local markets, small shows, or crypto meetups.

# 5. Time-Based Offers

Your bot could also be programmed to create limited-time payment links. Maybe you’re offering a discount for the next 10 buyers, or a temporary service. You generate a special QR code, set a timer, and once the window closes, it stops working or changes to a new one.

# The Simplicity Advantage

One of the best things about this setup is how low-maintenance it is. Once your bot is live, you don’t have to constantly check it. The QR Code API takes care of the hard part: creating a scannable image with all the details baked in.

You don’t need to run any heavy servers or manage complicated blockchain integrations. The API handles the formatting, and your wallet handles the rest.

# How to Extend It

Once you’re comfortable with the basics, there are a few ways you could level up your bot:

* Add monitoring to check if payments were received
* Generate unique addresses for each transaction using a wallet with xpub support
* Store user interactions and build stats
* Rotate between multiple wallets or addresses for privacy
* Build it into a larger system like a website, Telegram channel, or mobile app

The possibilities are wide open, and you can grow the project over time.

# Final Thoughts

Building a Bitcoin super bot doesn’t have to be complicated. With tools like the [Bitcoin QR Code API](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/), you can create smart, helpful automation without a big investment of time or money.

It’s a great way to explore what Bitcoin can do beyond just sending and receiving coins. Whether you’re a hobbyist, developer, creator, or business owner, a bot like this can be both practical and surprisingly powerful.

You don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Just automate what you’re already doing—receiving Bitcoin payments—and give it a smoother, smarter face. Let your bot do the work, while you focus on building something great.",1,1745176748.0,BitcoinQR,0,1.0,False
1k3u8l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1k3u8l6/puppy_bumping_into_things/,Puppy bumping into things,"Hi all,

We recently got a border collie puppy at 8 weeks old. He seems to very playful and energetic but while playing eg tug of war or fetch he doesn’t seem to have any regard to his surroundings in his excitement. 

He’s had very minor bumps on his sides and back, sometimes bumps his head on top after waking up from below the coffee table, often tumbles while chasing us and we change directions… I don’t think he’s had any injuries yet and still seems playful and always ready to go but I’m wondering if it’s too rough. 

We’re seeing a vet soon but hard to schedule till after Easter and just want to double check if these minor tumbles and bumps won’t hurt him. 

Thanks!

Here’s what I’ve scribbled together lately — no coffee stains were harmed in the making of this post.

# Balatro: The Game, the Myth, the Math

So, I started poking at *Balatro* data more seriously, and now I’m building my own stat-tracking mod (more on that coming soon!). It’s kind of like a FitBit for your runs, except it tracks Jokers, not steps. I’m logging everything I can — scoring patterns, shop choices, and yes, even the emotional rollercoaster that is the **Wheel of Fortune**. Spoiler: the [**Law of Large Numbers**](https://youtu.be/c-J9vWfxM0c) is real, even if your luck isn’t.

Need proof? I linked to a few brave souls on Reddit who manually tracked *1,000+* spins. Absolute legends.^(123) I also spotlighted a Redditor^(45) who built a public Joker sticker tracker — super handy if you’re not already rocking **Completionist++** (in which case, congrats, you’re basically the final boss).

I’m also tracking all the SQL I use during our **SQL Saturday streams** right in my [Balatro GitHub repo](https://github.com/napkimmath/balatro), so if you see a cool query on stream, you can snag it there — no need to squint at my screen.

# SQL Napkins: Wipe Up That Messy Data

Meanwhile, I’ve been building reusable SQL templates — aka [napkins](https://github.com/napkimmath/napkins) — that help you clean and analyze datasets faster than you can say `SELECT * FROM feelings`. They’re game-agnostic, meaning you can use them whether you’re analyzing Balatro runs, inventory spreadsheets, or your cats’ meal patterns.

If you’re new to SQL or BigQuery, don’t panic — [here’s the starter guide](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/introduction), and [here’s the ]()[syntax cheat sheet](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax). Pair it with my napkins, and you’ll be querying like a boss in no time.

# Content Dreams and Streaming Schemes

I’ve been scheming up video plans too — think SQL explainers, Balatro deep dives, and sneak peeks of my dataset as it evolves. Still learning the whole “editing” thing (aka, right now the clips are just vibes), but I’m live three times a week showing everything raw and unfiltered — like your data before a `WHERE` clause.

# Where to Find Me

* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@NapKimMath) for live gameplay as well as the archive (and future highlight dreams)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/napkimmath) for all the SQL goodness
* [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/napkimmath) if you wanna fuel my caffeine + server time

Thanks for watching me spin the Wheel of SQL these past couple weeks. More data, more napkins, and hopefully more jokers coming soon. As always, remember: **clean your data like you clean your counters — or at least like you clean your napkins.**

\*\*\*

It was late, and Luke was staring at the ceiling, burning holes in the bulkhead. 

There were too many fucking problems.

He couldn’t sleep, and the absence of *The Eventide’s* familiar engine hum wasn’t helping. There was something about being stationary - between jobs - that unsettled him. Not going anywhere. Not doing anything. Not moving forward.

And that damn fucking accident.

He tossed the sheet off in frustration and sat up, pausing to scrub the image out of his eyes. He needed a distraction - or to solve one of the problems eating into his sleep cycle.

As he sat there thinking about what to do, he heard Scott’s dull, reverberating baritone echo down the corridor. There was a clatter, stifled laughter, and telltale thuds - the sound of two drunkards trying to be quiet - and failing. 

He gathered his energy, steeling himself to tackle this one first. 

Yeah. One problem at a time.

He slid his pants on, standing up to prod at the door controls. His momentum faltered slightly as he stepped out - the sharp tang of welded metal and fresh plastic stinging his eyes.

The familiar *thud* of Scott face-planting into his bunk shook the bulkhead - an alcohol-induced landing that rattled fittings and shook dust from the lights. Luke passed his door, confident he wouldn’t be woken by anything less than an emergency alarm. 

He strode purposefully to Melanie’s cabin and rapped lightly on the doorframe. Time to tackle this one head-on. 

“Hey. Have a good night?”

Mel looked up wearily, halfway through squeezing a boot off her foot. 

“Yeaaah, pretty good. I had fun.” She grunted as it popped free. “Scott did a little altercatin’. Pretty good,” she repeated, already tugging at the second one.

Luke exhaled slowly. “Was it serious?”

Mel shook her head. “Naaaaah,” she said, standing to peel off her top, “jus’ a little stress relief. He’s gonna have a shiner tomorrow, though.” 

She winked, tossing the top casually aside. 

He nodded, glad there weren’t any new problems. He looked down, quietly searching for his next words as Mel stepped out of her pants.

“Look. Uhhhhh…” He stopped, closing his eyes for a moment. 

This was difficult. He hated thinking about it - talking about it was worse.

He took a deep breath and started again. Mel was already down to her underwear. He just needed to get it out.

“I just wanted…” Another pause - he mentally berated himself. “To apologise. And to say…thanks.” 

It wasn’t *everything* he wanted to say, but it was close enough.

She stopped at her underwear, hands on her hips as she squinted. Her head rolled to one side in confusion. 

“Oh - you mean for the, uh…accident thing? When…yeah.” 

She grimaced at the memory. 

“Yes! For the accident. For sitting there like a total idiot, watching that fucking cockpit while the whole world just…flew around in pieces and shit exploded. Yeah. I don’t know what happened, I just - one second he was there, and then he wasn’t - and I just didn’t - “ 

He waved his hand around, trying to grab the words. 

“- fucking do anything.*”*

He stopped, looking down to take a breath. He felt a little better.

“Uh…huh.” 

She sat with a soft thud. 

Her brow furrowed slightly, staring into the distance. Her bunk creaked as she turned to him, a little puzzled. 

“You know…you’re the captain, right?”

He nodded, painfully aware of how he’d failed in his duties.

“Yes, of course. I know I should’ve done better-”

“-nonono, I mean…you don’t…have to like…explain yourself - to me?”

She looked at him, hoping he understood. 

He did not. 

She shrugged.

“Eh…shit happens. You’re fine. Good. Like…a good captain? I didn’t say that, if anyone asks.” She wobbled slightly, smiling.

“Besides,” she took a breath, “first time I got shot at, I did exactly the same thing. Wet myself too.” She smiled and yawned, totally unfazed, then swung her legs onto the bunk.

Luke frowned. *That was it?*

Mel started to pull the sheet up, then paused, fixing him with a thoughtful - sleepy - look. 

“You gonna do it again?” 

He shook his head quickly. “I hope not.”

She shrugged. “Then what’s the problem? And you’re welcome.” 

She tugged the sheet up to her shoulders.

“G’night,” she sighed happily.

He stood awkwardly in the doorway. He’d mentally prepared a whole speech about what he would do differently - training courses he could take, a checklist of everything he’d done wrong and how he’d fix it-

“*Good night,*” she repeated.

He blinked, raised his eyebrows in a quick shrug, and turned to leave. 

\*\*\*

The next morning arrived with unstoppable vengeance.

Scott was trapped in an agony of his own making - one of strong drinks and bar fights, nausea and bruises - headaches and regret. 

His eyes twitched as footsteps echoed like explosions in his skull.

*Tap.* 

*Tap.* 

*Tap.*

A cup slammed into the counter with the force of a thousand vikings. The coffee machine screamed to life.

*Don’t do it. Don’t say it.* 

“Hi,” Katie said.

He groaned softly, taking a slow sip of his coffee and willing himself back in time. 

“Mornin’,” he croaked.

She padded delicately over to his table, sitting quietly.

“Are you okay?” she whispered.

He nodded. Carefully. Slowly. “Yep. I’ll be fine.”

He steeled himself, bringing the cup to his mouth for a long, deep gulp. Katie was looking at him with concern.

“Och, lass - I’m fine. Little too much to drink, is all.” 

He managed a weak smile.

She didn’t buy it, but nodded anyway - her eyes were somewhere else.

Scott took a moment to really look at her. Messy hair, misty eyes, pale skin - she actually looked worse than he felt.

“...Are *you* okay?” he tested, squinting past his coffee.

He could see the machinery working, assembling an attempt at a smile. Her voice cracked, though no words came out. She blinked. Her eyes were watering. 

She was not okay - a picture of barely-held-together pieces.

A deep sniff. A long sigh. 

“Ugh. I will be.” 

Scott switched gears. He took a slow, deep breath and leaned back in his chair, straightening himself.

Then he stared at her, waiting.

She made another smile. Thin. Anything but reassuring. 

He just kept staring. Sometimes silence worked better. Waiting.

Her eyes flicked nervously around.

He raised a heavy eyebrow.

“Okaaay,” she exhaled, collapsing onto the table with her face in her hands. “No. I’m struggling.”

Scott nodded, satisfied.

“I am *very much* struggling,” she breathed. “Everybody’s distant. Gordon is always busy. Luke-” 

She made a strange whining noise and thunked her head softly against the table.

*Thud.*

“Luke as well.” 

Scott grimaced as he watched her.

“Right. I won’t ask. But Luke’s…had a hard time. We all have.”

His hand drifted to his face, testing his bruised cheek with a wince.

“I just…” Her voice was on the verge of breaking. 

“...don’t know how much longer I can do this.” 

She looked up, misty-eyed. “Follons don’t do well with social isolation.” 

He nodded. “Aye, I can’t imagine.”

“Gordon is helping, but…” She looked at Scott pleadingly, begging his understanding.

“Hmmmm. Yeah, I know.”

She was burning him out. Using one person to meet all your social needs wasn’t sustainable. Especially when one thing had a habit of leading to another. 

Scott let out a long sigh. “Well, if ya promise to be gentle, I’m here,” he offered.

Katie’s ears perked up a little, eyebrows rising in surprise. 

“-For *hugs.* Or conversation. Company,” he added quickly.

Her shoulders dipped, ears flattening back down again. 

Scott watched, his heart melting a little.

“Aw, lass - surely not. This big ole’ Gorilla ain’t no good for you.” 

He did his best to smile kindly. 

She sniffed quietly, looking away. It *had* been eating at her.

“Can I ask…why?” 

His heart dropped. 

It wasn’t her fault - he didn’t keep secrets, not really. It was just that…some things were hard to talk about. Things that soured the conversation. Things he’d rather carry…quietly.

Whether it was the hangover, Katie’s vulnerability, or the act of dragging up old memories, his own eyes threatened to betray him.

“Katie.” He sighed, squeezing his eyes shut once to steady himself.

He knew she could be trusted. The hesitation came from knowing what might change if he said it. 

“It’s not you, lass.” He smiled softly.

He looked thoughtfully away, preparing himself to say it.

“When ah lost my wife, years back -“

Katie’s expression changed, tears threatening to start again. 

He held up a hand in reassurance.

“- ah couldn’t move on just like that. Still haven’t, really. It’s jus’ not me.”

His bitter smile changed into something else as another memory surfaced.

“And you-” he gestured with a warm smile “-remind me justa little bit too much of my daughter.” 

It wasn’t her. It wasn’t him, either. He just hadn’t wanted to move on. Nothing had touched his heart in the same way since. 

Katie blinked rapidly, her eyes melting with newfound affection.

The moment drifted by quietly as she smiled, warm and a little teary.

“Can I give you a hug?” she offered, eyes pleading.

Scott lifted a finger warily. 

“Gently,” he agreed.

\*\*\*

The station was relaxing, full of warm people with friendly smiles. 

Katie wandered aimlessly; not looking for anything in particular - just the comfort of families and friends enjoying each other’s company. 

She passed a calm, open restaurant where couples dined in the evening glow. Music and soft gestures trailed behind her.

Her moment with Scott had been lovely - emotionally recharging, grounding and helping her to feel more connected. A temporary relief for her hungry instincts. 

A Rellin skittered away from its frustrated mother, darting behind a small plant with a delighted squeal. Katie smiled warmly.

She wasn’t really sure what *closeness* meant to her any more. Was it physical bonding? Familiarity? Presence? Comfort? 

Humans seemed to have a different concept of it. Not just sharing space and activities - something more.

Had the instincts she’d followed - migrating from one group to another - ever given her real closeness?

She paused outside the habitation concourse, watching families coming and going. Children lifted onto shoulders. Partners walking arm in arm. Unhappy couples passing in silence. 

She sighed. 

“Okay. That’s enough.”

She turned and padded purposefully back to *The Eventide*. Gordon would be free soon. That would help.

She paused at the mess hall - already occupied by Luke’s weary presence.

Did everybody on this ship live in the mess hall? Didn’t they have cabins?

He noticed her before she could retreat, giving a faint nod before turning back to his mug.

“Hi.” He said quietly.

She hovered at the entrance. The tension was uncomfortable. 

“Uh. Hi.” She returned. “Just-” she pointed vaguely, “-going to…” 

She padded past him.

Luke paused as her scent drifted by. 

The whole interaction felt wrong. It shouldn’t be this awkward.

Another problem that needed solving, if he had any hope of sleep. 

He could just let it go - let things naturally return to normal like he usually did - but that didn’t feel right. 

Not this time.

He sighed. No time like the present.

“You were trying to help,” he said quietly, not taking his eyes off his mug. 

“I…don’t know. I just…wasn’t ready for it.” 

He turned to see her face.

She looked a little uncertain. Cautious - like she wasn’t sure where to step.

“In my defense, you could’ve chosen your words better-”

She frowned ever so slightly.

“-but I *may* have overreacted, as well.”

He could see her tension, caught between rebuttal and acceptance.

Talking to Katie was always difficult - like walking a tightrope. Why was that?

She eventually relented.

“That’s…fair.” 

She snuck in a sideways glance, ears half-turned to him - just a hint of suspicion.

He usually kept her at arm's length, avoiding eye contact. Now he was making an effort to talk. About his *feelings.* She didn’t know what to make of it.

First Scott, and now this. 

“That’s very…insightful of you,” she offered, reaching past him to grab a protein bar. 

As she drew close, she inhaled - then paused at a hint of something new.

Oh?

“I - sorry - I’ve had a lot of time to think. Not sleeping so well.” He smiled grimly.

She nodded, thoughtful, but only half-listening. 

A subtle change. Something…emotional. And physical. What was it?

She tuned in to each movement he made as she peeled open the protein bar and took a bite; every signal he let slip as he carefully sipped his coffee.

“You’ve changed,” she said quietly.

Luke sighed. “God…I hope so.”

She tilted her head and looked at him curiously, chewing. He had changed a little, like the wall around him had gotten smaller. Something was spilling over those walls, like water lapping at the edges of a dam.

She shook her head. “No, something else.” 

Luke looked like he was considering it. 

He shrugged. “Maybe, I guess.”

She took another bite. “No. Definitely,” she said thoughtfully, *while chewing.*

More open. He was still stiff, but somehow more comfortable. A subtle change in his tone of voice, a shift in his heartbeat, and a *slightly* different smell. *All that together usually meant…*

He frowned, looking down at himself to check if something was different.

She smirked at him and resisted an eye-roll. Okay, maybe he hadn’t changed *that* much. 

“Hmm. What do you mean?” he asked, hesitantly. 

Ah. Of course - he was still Luke, after all. Cute.

She swallowed and turned to watch his reaction. 

“You *like* me.” 

The mug slipped, spilling over onto the counter. 

It was like watching a newborn animal learn to walk. Stumbling, learning - somehow beautiful and captivating to watch. 

She smiled expectantly.

Luke frowned at the mess, then turned to her.

His mouth opened, ready to rebuke the very idea, but halfway he stopped. 

His frown softened and he looked away thoughtfully.

She ground to a halt, watching him process.

*What.*

What was *that?* 

No immediate rebuttal? No pivot to banter? 

Who was this?!

What changed?!

Katie froze as a thousand different thoughts raced past.

He met her gaze again. Her heart skipped over a beat as he opened his mouth, wondering if he was ready to finally say it.

“I…it doesn’t matter.”

*WHAT*

She screamed. On the inside. Her eye twitched as she wondered how humans had not gone *extinct* by now. He was *so close* that she could *literally smell it*

He turned to leave, shuffling quietly towards the corridor.

Her eyes narrowed. 

This *idiot*. 

This great, big, lumbering *idiot* had gotten *so close* to real, actual growth and then just turned around *like he’d forgotten his lunch.* 

She stared at his back, her chest tightening. This may be her only chance to open that crack in his armour. 

She panicked, and threw the remains of the bar at his head.

He paused. Turned.

*Patpatpat*

*Pomf*

I guess that was my mistake and it loosened my muscles down there.

I am 29 years old. I’ve always been attracted to men and women. I’ve had one girlfriend and one boyfriend throughout my 20s and have come out to some of my family and close friends about being bisexual. 

I have always had difficulty in being intimate and struggle to make romantic relationships. I struggle with both men and women however I have had no problem in hooking up at all. Generally I have hooked up with men quite regularly and hooked up with women maybe once a year. I have always found it confronting to date and be intimate with people even when I had a boyfriend or girlfriend. 

Recently I gave myself a challenge of trying to be more brave and ask for someone’s number. I met this girl in a coffee shop and was so attracted to her that I plucked the courage and asked for her number. We met up a couple of times for drinks and we fooled around, which I really enjoyed. When it came to having sex I had this nervous feeling where I felt exposed and unsure of myself. I found that during sex I was really turned off by her vagina and I couldn’t get hard enough to have vaginal sex. It was a failed attempt and got a bit awkward to say the least. 

Since then I’ve been spiralling with the thought that I am no longer attracted enough to women to have penetrative sex with them. The fact that this thought has sent me spiralling and caused me to have very low mood the last couple of weeks has highlighted to me how much I actually don’t want to be gay. Im very anxious about how my life will look and how I may not be able to take up much space in my cultural background. 

Im overwhelmed with thoughts of shame, sadness and anxiety about the whole situation and searching online for other posts hasn’t helped much. Why posting now will make a difference I’m not sure but I’m just a bit lost. 

On the one hand I’m concerned about how I can explore safely and stop overly  judging myself. On the other hand I have always had ideas about getting married to a women from my same culture, starting a family and having children as this is the main way I’ve seen life progress in my surroundings. 

I don’t believe in conversion therapy. I wouldn’t want to put myself through something like that. But at the same time I’d much rather be attracted to women so that I can live a regular life ",4,1745175811.0,askgaybros,7,0.83,False

They are quite far reaching and diverse. It’s an amazing revelation to me that the SGI is so involved in different aspects of society in so many cultures, working with so many like minded institutions throughout the world.

Min-On was founded by Ikeda Sensei on the premise that music and culture unite people and contribute to world peace. I knew that, but I *didn’t* know that, in 2016, Min-on established the “Min-On Music Research Institute (MOMRI)” to study the dynamics of how and when music contributes to peacebuilding. It’s website says*:*

*“By bringing together diverse talents from around the world, Min-On continues to create a platform for artistic collaboration and appreciation, bridging gaps and fostering a global*

*community united through the beauty of music and artistic expression.”*

Dig a little deeper and find links to “Music and the Healing Brain”, “Music Therapy Reading List”, “the U.S. National Archives Data on Arts and Culture”, and much, much more.

One of my favorite forms of relaxation is listening to live music in an intimate setting (bar, restaurant, coffee house, etc.) so I’m going to be exploring MOMRI  and its contributors and analysis.

I'm 102.5 kilos and started at 133kg. So I've lost 30.5kg (4 stone 11) in total.
I started weight training around 10 weeks ago. 
I do gym 4-5 times a week and this is usually 3-4 days of weight lifting (40kg lat pull down and low row, 20kg chest press, 25kg leg extension and press, 30kg abductor, 70kg leg press) as well as approx 30 mins cardio (treadmill, or cross trainer or stairmaster or some mix of 2 or 3 of these- I do the glutes workout on cross trainer). I also ensure I walk minimum 9k steps a day whether I do the gym or not.
I drink minimum 2 litres water a day- usually 3 including coffee and protein shake etc.
I do eat meals 2-3 times a day, and don't eat when not hungry. But I do get hungry so eat when I am.
I've not lost any weight in 6 weeks now. I was eating 1350 calories.
I was working out my TDEE using sedentary initially.
4 weeks ago, I checked my TDEE and 1-2 times exercise is classed as light exercise, 3-5 is mderate. I changed it to light and it told me to up my calories from 1350 to 1640 which I did. It's not made a difference. 

Things I've tried:

Upping my calories as above.

I've tried having a higher calorie day at 1800-2200 calories, then tried two of these days in a row.

A rest: I've just had a week off the gym, we went away. I still hit 10k steps a day, but just strolling, no intense exercise. I ate no more than 1650 cals a day apart from one day where I hit 2100 as I had wine and pizza.

Eating more fibre

I have been weighting between the 2lb and 5lb mark in my current stone bracket for this whole time.

I'm after some advice. 
Has anyone hit a plateau for 6 weeks or more and what did you do to break it?

Should I just keep on?

Should I try to reduce my calories again back to sedentary?

I've looked at mderate exercise on TDEE calculator and it says to eat 2000 a day. Should I try this? ( I will struggle)

My protein may have dropped a bit to around 80g a day so I'm starting to hit 120g a day from today to help.

1k3trnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/kolkata/comments/1k3trnk/check_in_cheque_out_the_lowest_point_in_indian/,Check in Cheque Out - The lowest point in Indian cinema since Deshdrohi,"Some films are bad. Others are so excruciatingly tone-deaf and inept, they leave behind a cultural skid mark. In the growing tide of self-funded vanity projects masquerading as cinema, Check In Cheque Out crashes ashore with spectacular audacity. It's not a film. It’s a full-length incoherent reel, a B-grade trainwreck that feeds the mediocrity Bengal seems so comfortable celebrating these days. An abomination, manufactured and “spearheaded” by none other than the human LinkedIn update himself: 145East’s wealthy dhoti-clad ambassador—the self-anointed cultural revivalist and walking contradiction behind “Make Calcutta Relevant Again”, this video is a perfect emblem of his brand: all noise, no note. Projecting himself as a busy, forward-thinking cultural tastemaker, he seems to have confused curation with creation, as previously seen at his failed fusion project that stands tall in Topsia.

The irony is almost poetic how desperately he tries to be the creative torchbearer of modern Calcutta. Here we have a man who’s a disgrace not only to the city, but to his lineage and even the luxury he inherited. That anyone with even a shred of influence in Bengal would bend over backwards to suck up to this man-child is pathetic. But then again, when your only credential is a fat wallet, it’s unsurprising how this pile of narrative compost managed to attract flaky celebs (a combination of Bengali social climbers and complacent influencers), the Southern Avenue “intelligentsia” and the latest wave of Alipore’s Marwari revellers who’ve now added “art appreciation” to their post-brunch rituals. All of them circling the producer like moths. Influencers who peddle soy candles, Burlap People tote Bags and Sanskrit tattoos every year at India Story, are now rallying behind him and reposting his “grind” as if hustling means overstaffed shoots and chai breaks with ‘quirky’ clapboards, 

Let’s talk about the video itself. Check In Cheque Out is what happens when someone with too much money and zero cinematic vocabulary decides they’re Wes Anderson after watching half of The Darjeeling Limited on mute. The performances are cardboard at best, the script reads like it was assembled using ChatGPT on low battery, and the camera work has the grace of a drunk uncle with a selfie stick. It's a putrid, constipated mess—an unintentional comedy of f\*ck-all performances and an even worse script. If this is what passes for film, then we’ve officially hit bedrock. Every frame oozes amateurism, from the wooden acting to the cringe-inducing dialogues that might as well have been lifted from WhatsApp conversations of city's depressed cat-obsessed youth high on old monk and anxiety medication.

The directorial work deserves a special mention, if only for being the lowest rung of anything calling itself cinema. No vision, no pacing, no sense of visual language, just a desperate stab at being “offbeat” (pun fully intended) but succesfully off-putting, all while hiding behind the smoke and mirrors of “busy schedules” and pseudo-creative jargon.

It’s hilarious, sure, but not in the way the filmmakers intended. Every line lands like a thud in an empty auditorium. More like watching a clown trip over his own oversized shoes while trying to read Sartre. The crowd this initiative draws — prog-rock fanboys from the suburbs with the cultural sensitivity of a YouTube comment, only completes the farce.

And of course, Kolkata's poster child for inherited wealth and forced relevance, continues to proudly post promotional photos with hashtags like #InspiringCinema and #CinemaWithSoul, and cosplay as Calcutta’s creative conscience while shoveling mediocrity down our throats like it’s artisanal mishti, instead of checking on the wellbeing of those who sat through the full runtime of this ordeal. Check in Check on (them)!

He's undeterred and will soon be back with another Instagram story about “building something meaningful”, usually over a backdrop of jazz hands, black coffee, and a Chandrabindoo vinyl that’s never been played when the camera's off. He’s not making Calcutta relevant—he’s desperately trying to make himself relevant in a city that’s too polite to tell him he’s not.

By fostering an ecosystem that mistakes wealth and visibility for merit, there’s a dangerous precedent being set here. When cultural legitimacy can be bought and sold this easily, it makes space smaller for those genuinely trying to innovate. A damning case study of what happens when unchecked privilege and influence replace insight, and access stands in for artistic integrity. Such a disaster makes you genuinely fear for what passes as “art” in this city.",3,1745175446.0,kolkata,2,1.0,False

How it started:
	•	Me and my friend drew caricatures of our teacher.
	•	I was showing them to another friend when the teacher came over, he didn’t see them just saw yellow post it .
	•	I quickly hid the drawings in my agenda and covered them with my arm.
	•	He kept insisting to see them, asking things like, “Are those drawings? Is that a drawing of me?”
	•	I shook my head and lied because I didn’t want him to know and get offended.
	•	He constantly brings up the drawings and mentions checking my agenda.
	•	He said: “If your friend forgets her materials again, I’ll check your agenda.”
	•	He also said: “The day you ask to go to the restroom, I’ll check your agenda.”
	•	One day when I asked to go to the restroom, he said no at first, claiming I’m in a bad-behavior class.
	•	Then he let me go anyway and, while writing in my agenda, asked if I’d show him the drawings at the end of the year.
	•	I replied “mhmm,” and he said, “I want words.”
	•	He did the same thing when I got my college acceptance — asked if I was happy, and when I said “mhmm,” he said again, “I want words.”

	•	He often tries to start random conversations with me during exams. Which annoys me 
	•	One time, he teased me about my henna, asking if I wrote answers in it.
	•	He also asked if I hid answers in my calculator, used it, then left it on my desk with “666” typed in.
	•	On my exams, he sometimes writes hints near questions I struggle with or writes directly in my notebook.
	•	He always asks me specifically if I’ve finished writing my notes.
	•	He teases me about little things, like asking if my cup had coffee or water in it.
	•	One time I gave him a polite smile in the hallway, and now he stares at me often.
	•	Last Friday, I was tying my shoes and noticed him watching me, then shrugging.
	•	He changed the class seating and put me at the front, right in front of his desk.
	•	When me and my friend panicked about being separated, he said we’d still be together.
	•	He said to me: “I’m choosing where I’ll put you. Sorry, not sorry. If you had a better class, I’d let you choose.”
	•	He often stands behind me in class or hovers near my seat, even when there’s space elsewhere.
	•	He passes behind my chair a lot for no clear reason.
	•	My friend keeps teasing me saying “he likes you.”
	•	I honestly don’t know — I was just being polite to him in
	•	He’s obsessed with my agenda and always tries to grab it.
	•	One time during an exam, he kept trying to talk to me, then suddenly grabbed my eraser and erased a scribble someone else had done — and blamed it on me just to tease me.
	•	When it was time to leave class, he didn’t say anything to anyone but waited and then said loudly, “Bye [my name],” which was kind of embarrassing.
	•	After the “cup” incident, he walked away murmuring something with my name in it. My friends and I couldn’t catch it clearly, but it sounded like, “I knew [my name] was like…”

19M: He picked me up out of halls of residence, we went to the library. He’s a classics/philosophy reader. We had a pretty interesting conversation while we had a coffee. He commented on some Greek philosophers, about why he’s an atheist (I’m a catholic) and some other things like that. He’s respectful, asked all time if I was comfortable, complimented my hair and how good I smelled. He walked me to the dorms. He texted me later about how good our date was. 

23M: He picked me up too, and we went to a pretty fancy restaurant. We had less interest conversation, we talked about our lives and all that. We are both catholic and we both like films. He gave me flowers when he picked me up, he’s funny. He’s a right wing guy, but we share some ideas though. He was a bit more touchy. He complimented my nails, my dress, how “elegant and beautiful ” I looked. He drove me to the dorms.

1k3tl16,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1k3tl16/my_teacher_keeps_acting_weird_toward_me_is_this/,My teacher keeps acting weird toward me — is this normal?,"I just wanted to know if this behaviour is normal, and I don’t want to ask people around me because I feel like I’m overreacting because I’m not feeling  too uncomfortable, and I’m pretty shy too

How it started:
	•	Me and my friend drew caricatures of our teacher.
	•	I was showing them to another friend when the teacher came over, he didn’t see them just saw yellow post it .
	•	I quickly hid the drawings in my agenda and covered them with my arm.
	•	He kept insisting to see them, asking things like, “Are those drawings? Is that a drawing of me?”
	•	I shook my head and lied because I didn’t want him to know and get offended.
	•	He constantly brings up the drawings and mentions checking my agenda.
	•	He said: “If your friend forgets her materials again, I’ll check your agenda.”
	•	He also said: “The day you ask to go to the restroom, I’ll check your agenda.”
	•	One day when I asked to go to the restroom, he said no at first, claiming I’m in a bad-behavior class.
	•	Then he let me go anyway and, while writing in my agenda, asked if I’d show him the drawings at the end of the year.
	•	I replied “mhmm,” and he said, “I want words.”
	•	He did the same thing when I got my college acceptance — asked if I was happy, and when I said “mhmm,” he said again, “I want words.”

	•	He often tries to start random conversations with me during exams. Which annoys me 
	•	One time, he teased me about my henna, asking if I wrote answers in it.
	•	He also asked if I hid answers in my calculator, used it, then left it on my desk with “666” typed in.
	•	On my exams, he sometimes writes hints near questions I struggle with or writes directly in my notebook.
	•	He always asks me specifically if I’ve finished writing my notes.
	•	He teases me about little things, like asking if my cup had coffee or water in it.
	•	One time I gave him a polite smile in the hallway, and now he stares at me often.
	•	Last Friday, I was tying my shoes and noticed him watching me, then shrugging.
	•	He changed the class seating and put me at the front, right in front of his desk.
	•	When me and my friend panicked about being separated, he said we’d still be together.
	•	He said to me: “I’m choosing where I’ll put you. Sorry, not sorry. If you had a better class, I’d let you choose.”
	•	He often stands behind me in class or hovers near my seat, even when there’s space elsewhere.
	•	He passes behind my chair a lot for no clear reason.
	•	My friend keeps teasing me saying “he likes you.”
	•	I honestly don’t know — I was just being polite to him in
	•	He’s obsessed with my agenda and always tries to grab it.
	•	One time during an exam, he kept trying to talk to me, then suddenly grabbed my eraser and erased a scribble someone else had done — and blamed it on me just to tease me.
	•	When it was time to leave class, he didn’t say anything to anyone but waited and then said loudly, “Bye [my name],” which was kind of embarrassing.
	•	After the “cup” incident, he walked away murmuring something with my name in it. My friends and I couldn’t catch it clearly, but it sounded like, “I knew [my name] was like…”

I knew I wouldn’t like it but I was thrown off the minute I entered the auditorium. Bright flashing stage lights circled the room and blinded me. There was a band singing the entire time and out of nowhere this guy popped up and was yelling a story as they played. He’d pop up in different places and the spotlight would circle to him, I wonder how many times they rehearsed that.

When the music stopped the pastor began and there were three monitors on the stage. I could see the pastor on the monitors but not the stage I asked her where was he on the stage, I couldn’t see him. And she said “he’s at another campus”, okay that’s weird?? Like how many campuses are there. And then I realized it was a semi-mega church type situation. 

The guy started preaching about mental health, which is fine. But then he said “I see all these young people struggling with depression and anxiety but really they are letting sin take over.” My jaw dropped I turned to my mom and then he proceeded to say “it’s like for them being happy isn’t the norm.” I walked out got a coffee from the 1 out of 15 coffee machines they had and sat outside and waited for it to end.

1k3tie7,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwWVTPXXisY,I grew up reciting “He is risen indeed!” This chapter made me stop believing it.,"Like a lot of you, I grew up in a tradition where the resurrection wasn’t just believed—it was assumed. Built into the liturgy. Baked into the hymns. Central to the creeds. “He is risen indeed” was as routine as the coffee after service.

So I thought: if anything about Christianity is solid, it has to be the resurrection.

This chapter of my audiobook was an attempt to reconstruct the resurrection story from the four gospels—no apologetics, no outside sources, just the biblical text.

Instead of harmony, I found contradictions:

* Who saw Jesus first?
* Were there one or two angels?
* Did anyone recognize him?
* Was it in Galilee or Jerusalem?
* And why does Mark originally end without a single resurrection appearance?

I didn’t expect this to break me. I honestly thought I’d find something to hold on to. But it fell apart instead.

I've made this installation in my camper van as a 230V power source, just charging from my car so no solar panels. 

First test night out with the campervan and turned everything on, the inverter worked and we had electricity in the back in 230V. However next morning trying to make coffee we had no electricity.

Turned out we used up the initial load the AGM battery we ordered came with but the battery didn't charge anything on our drive to our camping place.

To troubleshoot the problems we turned the installation back on and had a one hour drive. Unless the AGM battery didn't get any extra charge. The lights on the Orion were on and I could definitely also feel heat on the charger. I also made sure that in the app I turned the Victron Orion to 'charge' 

Am I missing something? Is it a setting? A wiring problem? I included my electrical schematic although I changed the 100A fuse to 60A, if any translations are needed (some words are in Dutch) please let me know",1,1745174528.0,Victron,4,1.0,False
1k3tfbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1k3tfbc/dating_advice/,Dating Advice,"Hi everyobe! First time poster, long time reader now soliciting advice. 
Context: I (32M, gay) am a PhD student. I am out and open about my sexuality. I am nothing new to asking guys out and/or being bold just to never miss out on a moment or opportunity that could potentially mean something. That's where this gets very interesting/tricky.
Problem: Every week my department has a colloquium speaker for us. It is almost always a professor from a university that comes to talk about their research. In October 2023, they had a very attractive, educated, funny, personable professor from a university in a nearby area from me come in and talk. My body chemistry just went nuts...like I was enamored by this man (i paid attention to his entire lecture, enjoyed his humor, jokes, etc.) and deep down in my gut, there is just something about him. I haven't been able to stop thinking about him to this day (April 2025), not obsessively of course, just occassionally. So I scoped him during this colloquium meeting...first qualifier is there was no wedding ring. I did look at his research website for any info about him that may help me disqualify him from attempting to pursue him. I also connected with him on LinkedIn (go to network regardless). Just anything available to give me data to make an informed decision. Unfortunately, I don't know what his situation is...if he is single, if he is a member of the LGBTQ+ community, etc. 
Problem: Figured though I don't have all the info so I guess I'll make a move. It does seem harmless to do so. As mentioned, we are connections on linkedin, we connected shortly afterwards. I have not seen him like my posts there but LinkedIn is different from traditional social media so it may not imply anything likenit would on traditional social media platforms. But I don't know if his situation is different or if it is appropriate professionally or if I should move forward with this. It's been a constant tug of war. Im a 4th year PhD student and he is a professor at a different university (no direct connection to me) so I don't know if that is inappropriate or not. As mentioned I don't know much about him or his life.  I was thinking of just reaching out on LinkedIn and being very casual but direct. Something like ""hey, I remember you from a talk you gave and honestly, you really stuck with me. I don't know what your situation is, but would you like to grab coffee, etc. If not, no big deal, etc.""
Questions: (1) is it appropriate and not too taboo? (2) should I go for it? (3) if, yes, any suggestions outside of what I pitched above? Or is that good? (4) what is suggested if yes? (5) if no, why would this be a bad idea (I'm genuinely curious just to educate myself on this for professional reasons moving forward). 

The way I see it is we are not directly connected in anyway professionally and honestly I may never see him again the rest of my life personally/professionally so if I did reach out, it seems very low stake. And if he isn't interested, no harm done. Just move of and satisfy the curiosity. But maybe I'm wrong?",1,1745174497.0,lgbt,3,0.67,False

1k3tcym,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1k3tcym/31y_male_had_a_cryoablation_8_months_ago_for_svt/,"(31y Male) Had a cryoablation 8 months ago for SVT, experiencing more and more weird extrasystoles lately","Hello, I am 31, last summer I was diagnosed with SVT (bouveret syndrome in French), I had episodes of tachycardia, going from 80 to 170, within a second. It usually last 10 to 20min. During the worst episode I stayed at 170bpm for almost 2 hour which freaked me out... so they did an ECG during this episode and spotted an **SVT** (junctional intranodal tachycardia) without any accessory pathway. I had 2 echograph where they didn't found anything.

I had sporadic episodes like this (much shorter) over the course of the last 10 years, and it always triggered a huge anxiety tha lasted for months.

  
Last summer I decided to get a **cryoablation** with a well respected surgeon in Paris, even tho I know that the  cardiologists in my hometown (Bordeaux, France) do not really approve of cryoablation, they just do RF Ablation because they told me that's what they learned at the university, and that cryoablation isn't really the gold standard. One of them (I saw him a few weeks after surgery because I returned to my hometown) was surprised after reading the surgery report that they fired many times.

  
Anyway, since the surgery, I never had a real episode of tachycardia anymore, but from the very afternoon of the surgery up until now, **I experience what I call (maybe wrongly) ""extrasystoles"".** I feel what I felt during the beginning of my episodes of tachycardia, a feeling of falling, like the heart stop, and the breath is short for half a second, then it goes back to normal. It was better a few days after the surgery up until 2 months ago. I now experience those frequentely, like **once or twice a day,** during evening/at night mostly. I tried to drastically reduce coffee, and even replaced it with small dosage of tea, that doesn't seems to make a difference. 

One top of those extrasystoles, sometimes at the same time but sometimes independentely, I feel my heart **beating stronger, like very hard**, not fast, just pounding. And this feeling was gone for almost 6 months after surgery, just to come back 2 months ago again... I was really happy to not feel that pounding heart feeling after surgery!



My question is do you think those ""extrasystoles"" are something caused by the ablation? or they were there before ? Or maybe they are caused by stress and anxiety ? 

This whole thing is giving me load of anxiety, I had to see a mental health doctor a few months to help ease my fears.

I want no context. None of the listing of your hobbies bullshit, let's get to the juice. I wanna read those 5 paragraph essays in your notes app, those journal pages that your poured your soul into.

This is where I think I will find you. Not in your age or your favourite colour, but the inner workings of your soul. To see the way you think and what you think about, what troubles you or excites you, what you find worth documenting. What your aspirations and fears are. Plus, it could be fun to sort of piece together the basic information as we go along. Don't give me context on anything. Literally if you wouldn't explain it to your journal, don't explain it to me. Some detective action. I want to be incredibly confused on half the things you talk about but that's part of the fun.

I think similarly, not having the pressure to respond or explain ourselves to a new person is great too. In journalling, some enjoy a little a day, writing about the weather and coffee, brunch with friends, others may keep that shit empty and sudden write eight pages in an evening after an event of turmoil. Similarly, we decide the pace.

If you're interested at all, do message me! This is just an idea and I'd be more than happy to think about other logistics of this or other ways in which this could work. For example what if we would like to directly respond to something the other person writes, etc.

1k3t4t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1k3t4t4/confused_about_my_sexuality/,Confused about my sexuality,"Nearly 30 and worried about my sexuality

I am 29 years old. I’ve always been attracted to men and women. I’ve had one girlfriend and one boyfriend throughout my 20s and have come out to some of my family and close friends about being bisexual. 

I have always had difficulty in being intimate and struggle to make romantic relationships. I struggle with both men and women however I have had no problem in hooking up at all. Generally I have hooked up with men quite regularly and hooked up with women maybe once a year. I have always found it confronting to date and be intimate with people even when I had a boyfriend or girlfriend. 

Recently I gave myself a challenge of trying to be more brave and ask for someone’s number. I met this girl in a coffee shop and was so attracted to her that I plucked the courage and asked for her number. We met up a couple of times for drinks and we fooled around, which I really enjoyed. When it came to having sex I had this nervous feeling where I felt exposed and unsure of myself. I found that during sex I was really turned off by her vagina and I couldn’t get hard enough to have vaginal sex. It was a failed attempt and got a bit awkward to say the least. 

Since then I’ve been spiralling with the thought that I am no longer attracted enough to women to have penetrative sex with them. The fact that this thought has sent me spiralling and caused me to have very low mood the last couple of weeks has highlighted to me how much I actually don’t want to be gay. Im very anxious about how my life will look and how I may not be able to take up much space in my cultural background. 

Im overwhelmed with thoughts of shame, sadness and anxiety about the whole situation and searching online for other posts hasn’t helped much. Why posting now will make a difference I’m not sure but I’m just a bit lost. 

On the one hand I’m concerned about how I can explore safely and stop overly  judging myself. On the other hand I have always had ideas about getting married to a women from my same culture, starting a family and having children as this is the main way I’ve seen life progress in my surroundings. 

I don’t believe in conversion therapy. I wouldn’t want to put myself through something like that. But at the same time I’d much rather be attracted to women so that I can live a regular life ",0,1745173712.0,askgaybros,0,0.33,False
1k3t1wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/raplyrics/comments/1k3t1wg/realm_of_disses_part_33/,Realm of Disses (Part 3/3),"Even a mod with the lightest pen here conjured of energy to act as if it’s a proper damage control for Big Contract after I flexed an IQ test that personally got 161 on while laughing about it other people taking it in real life with me while drinking wine 

Advised him to have some integrity in his Disses: 

‘I’m going to Diss him and tell him he’s not a genius and no one reads his post that will get him’

Brain span probably doesn’t even have half the attention to break any of it down.

I’ll be noncompliant in every in any of these people’s timelines. Eyes hoping to Cognitive Dissonance any evidence as another human that has proven that he doesn’t read

He was nothing either. Equivalent to the last 3. Sitting with this Diss in his irrelevant account not even have a right to play 

Could read his words on his account start quoting and break them down verses mine, and tally count if his rhymes are composed of any high creativity. And got to that eventually 

‘IQ flexer’, yes in fact I even wanted to spread his death out:

Dropped in water attached to pomegranates with nano grenades inside because I like the color of a red sea, and show the same light as only frequencies that you radiated during its minimum duration. Hyping up vivid relevance enough though his composition to the art is simply a percent of his fleeting oxygen

Take the Big IQ that I ‘flexed’ while he’s impressed with one mere human’s english languages while I’m the one that’s pressured to use it

Divided my entire IQ to natural numbers of 1. Then customized each one those into smarter humans to walk the earth since its obviously that massive to do it and ship lower entities like him out because I’m smart enough to not increase the population that much in my calculations that there’s a bunch of him

While instead in silence, sit in laughter while one of those clones interact antagonizing the rest of him, and his associations that he wanted to mention

I’ve been created better coherent languages myself. Hoping to see a higher intellectual percentage and then I can comfortably communicate

Perhaps I can teach him so that can translate in verses his account, so others can see not only a better process that I’ll be involved with in the worth of him, and a new language. But told him go get a better Pen first 

Here’s the first Paragraph ‘again’:

‘Drop you in water attached to Pomegranates with Nano grenades inside because I like the color of a Red Sea’

(Get it?)

‘And show the same Light as only Frequencies that you Radiated during its minimum duration’

(Get it?)

‘Hyping up vivid relevance enough though your composition to the Art is simply a percent of your fleeting Oxygen’

(Get it?)”

Bars after stating that I wanted to spread is death out. Looks pretty coherent to me

Thought a diss was to test me with mentioning of my IQ

But he failed a test live on his own diss by comprehension. Thank you for allowing me to Reiterate. He test is to break down all of my paragraphs 

All of the double meanings and under ones. Expose The_Silencer_00 when hr obviously failed in the fact that his literal attempt right here in front of everyone the “cognitive dissonance” that he has

His diss dismissed in mere hours. I still want a break down of my response in comparison to this trash that he just posted. Before his says ‘The_Silencer_00’ I can’t do that. Let’s space it out since his thought process needs me to do that:

Take the Big IQ that I ‘flexed’ while you’re impressed

With ne mere human’s English languages

While I’m the one that’s ‘Pressured’ to use it

Divided my entire IQ to natural numbers of 1.

Then customized each One those into smarter humans

To walk the earth since its obviously that massive to do it

And ship lower entities like you out because I’m smart

Enough to Not increase the Population that much in my calculations that there’s a bunch of you

While instead in ‘Silence’, Sit in Laughter

While one of those Clones interact antagonizing the rest of you

And your associations you wanted to mention

I’ve been created better coherent Languages myself

Hoping to see a higher intellectual percentage

And then I can comfortably communicate

Perhaps I can teach you that can Translate on your account

So others can see not only a better process

That I’ll be involved with in the worth of you

And a New language but go get a better Pen first”

Failed a test that this own person created. Psychologically run circles around him and make him yell ‘Spell check’ lacking understanding that anyone can express things how ever they want. While your entire thought process is what accounts for this Litmus Test

Defeating his writings.

Take ‘Death” that he throws and crumble it up and pluck it back. The magic to that is the difference in how both our words really affect one another

Another One is in the trash. I’ll kick that worthless bucket that I just threw him in. Then watch him tumble out of it for thoughts to crawl out of the bed with that type of diss 

It’s okay if he didn’t read any of it. It’s here for him to sit with it. A gift with him whenever he needs ambition to level up his writings instead of his recent post 

Took his entire post and created my own seminar right out of it. On his own post constrained by lore of me that he didn’t read about

First lesson: Simply just tell me that you don’t like my writings instead of your lack of life and knowledge defying student’s constant collections of embarrassment

Still want him to break down my barz and share them here. Just to convey my sense of humor in the fear of him reading anything on my account. Class is over you’re simply a drop out. I Dropped In took you right out instantly

‘I won’t read or respond. I saw that he does this but I didn’t think to see him this quick here’

Veer his attention elsewhere, and let’s see some extensions of the topics that he can quote in my creations

Using a fallacy to damage control the reality of his intellectual lackadaisical antics. Easy coffin with my coffee. His expelled from sessions of ever rhyming with me

He’s ‘Tickled’ by the presence of an entity with Brighter thoughts. Put some space in my lines as this deranged man claims ‘verbosity’ overdosing on my paragraph 

He was confused the word “verbosity” with merely Mass. he’s not as a good Actor as the Ghost from my Slammed Coffins 

In his Diss. A bunch of words that he wanted to rhyme with to equip insults. Let’s rewind this one:

Ohh as I thought. Over 50,000 words on my account. With Zero post of me mentioning ‘Einstein’ outside of this one. Binary thinking verses breach of a human showing up

Mentioning “Einstein” building a diss of ignorant bricks thrown. Only Relativity and much more topics that he or Einstein even knows about in his quantum attempts to grab a little attention of mine

You’ve had some. Thanked him for his pointless Letter. ‘Dear’ these responses to whomever this was 

To him, Big Contract, and two foloosh ghouls. I’m going to write an Original called The_Silencer_00 vs his Pen Part 2, and give them all at least 8 weeks to attempt to break it down. They can use AI, the internet, people they know…other writers. Etc

All are invited. As a human I know none of them have enough time. And since Big Contract finally claiming to be a father now 

Pick a topic on “The_Silencer_00 vs his Pen Part 2” on a YouTube stream while I hope they can keep up while I show up as a real human teaching all of it to them 

One thumb, shift the entire attention to me when they simply could have scrolled past it. Let’s see how much these 4 heroes materialized to attempt to impress me will do

Might even write some lyrics down during the class breaks of my two new students to entertain them with when they are doing Limits
(Time and date stamped it)

Otherwise write a Diss by showing their lyrical abilities. Instead ‘Well well didn’t read so we will claim it as something in the elements of nonsense’. Of course a fish humans right out of the Internet this dense

I’m Chill, then get gory quick. Get witless circumscribing idiots written in a book of mine. Design a chapter of chilling nights 

I’m real life they know when I writing even when I’m not physically around because right out of the microwave their lack of nutrient bites would still leave them with a cold tongue

Then bring Mr. Infamous back from my Famous_Answer to encompass real snow around the glass world until it’s a comet. Finally throw him something for him to revolve around since he wants to be with a sun

Dissed on AI technology. Then he was told to be in a fake cradle of a spherical glass of a house inside of it with fake snow on it huddled inside 

Showed them a “peak” of how I can even think of my rhymes in front of all four of them and would break down plenty more

An ability of mind emergent from the complexity of my written (and creativity in them) makes it easy for me to analyze every trash letter in their rhymes. Can read anything that all of them wrote for years in under 5 minutes

Taught them something that had 8 meanings in it with 2 more ones still hidden. 
Downvoting didn’t even reshape my creativity

Every tactic imagined I antagonized that too. Down votes still had my entire verses there disappear. Having the audience reading a diss of fake dominance

Then they click my name like I popped up from the darkness. 4 targets now let’s see if they can catch up

And I don’t even mean in mass that is already given up my them. The matter is the amount of posts all four of them have at this point of time with a galactic magnitude of trash

Of course they simply orbit it around like it’s profound. All four of those dudes are grounded until I decide to come back out…

But I have to say- I also enjoy intentionally walking into them and buying overpriced goods sometimes. I like the freedom of experiencing a combination of both. 

I’m currently in Bologna, and sitting in a shop that would be considered a tourist trap- a brightly lit pastry shop that has photos in their menu and gimmicky coffees. Definitely not mind-blown with what I’ve ordered, but I love the company of myself and enjoying it regardless!

Or when I was in Florence, trying to research leather shops and read about differing opinions. I ended up just strolling into a few shops until I found a style I liked, aware that I overpaid with a vendor that thinks I am unaware I did.

I (31 F) have been with my bf (27 M) for 7 years now. For most of our relationships I’ve been pretty chill with his parentals. His mother is a hairdresser and his dad is a former cab driver and doesn’t work, can be lazy but his hearts in the right place

His parents split shortly after he and I got together. His mom moved to Texas and his dad stayed in FL. A bit after this we also moved to TX as I’d lost my mom and dad tragically and I wanted a fresh start. When we moved to TX we lived with his mother and her bf and that is when I learned something important—

His mother is terrible at choosing partners. 

To shorten it, this man verbally and physically abused her for the entire 6 years they were together. He was very aggressive and verbally abusive to my bf and me during the time we lived there. We moved into our own place after the first year and only saw them during special occasions like holidays or Wrestlemania (we all enjoy wrestling.) His being an abusive jerk didn’t affect us much once we moved out.

That was until I got pregnant and had our twin girls. We went back to live with his mom and her bf for a short time while I recovered and got back to working. And boy oh boy. He would yell at her every night, blame us (my bf, our children, myself) for every single thing that went wrong in his life. I spent more time hiding until I heard his Harley rev up than actually enjoy being a mom. I’d only leave our little room once he’d left.

It all culminated with an explosive argument over a broken AC (he blamed us naturally). He threw a coffee mug at my face, called me a bitch and other things, and told us he didn’t give a fuck about us or our daughters (9 mos). My MIL defended him and this prompted she and I to verbally spat. I just couldn’t understand putting this abusive man above her only grandchildren… above her only son. With that, I took our savings and moved out asap. That night traumatized me and made our kids very wary of loud noises and of my MIL.

Fast forward a year. At this point we’ve had my MIL over to visit maybe twice? And each time the twins cry and scream until she leaves. The sound of her voice makes them panic. The plan was to slowly acclimate her to them again with weekly hang outs- just us. But she canceled on every visit and it’s now been  8 months since we’ve seen her. In this time she’s moved out on her own and left her ex. Good!

But she’s met another guy and he seems sketchy. Bad. All the sudden she is ignoring our calls and texts. The one form of communication we still have with her… Being generally not a good mom or grandma. 

We finally finally get her to pick up and we ask her to come over and watch this years Wrestlemania. It’s been a tradition for us since my bf and I met. Never missed a Mania. Never. She asked if her new bf (we do not know this guy btw) can come too. We tell her no. We just wanna see her as it’s been 8 months. It’d be less overwhelming on the kids.

She promised to come and no showed on night one. Didn’t text us until 11 at night to apologize for “sleeping in.” I was annoyed but let it go.

So this morning (night 2 of Mania) I’m prepped for her visit— bought her fav snacks and drinks. Gave our girls a nice soothing bath and set them up to be ready for this visit. And we get a text…

“Can I please bring *new bfs name*?? He’s not as aggressive as *abusive exs name* You will like him! I promise.”

I’m flabbergasted as we had already been pretty clear on this. And with her history of bfs I wasn’t in the mood to meet this guy while also mediating her reunion of sorts with her grandchildren that are afraid of her lol so we told her no. Again.

She got upset and said we were being unkind to her and her new guy. So when I saw my bf about to fold… I stepped in. I told her she can come alone and be in her grandchildren’s lives, enjoy Mania and be happy with that. Or she can bail but she wouldn’t be welcome around my home or my kids for the foreseeable future. 

She chose to not come.

I feel like maybe I was being selfish but I also hurt knowing how loving and kind my own mom was and knowing my daughters have only one grandma and she doesn’t give a shit about them. She brags at church and on socials about them but when given multiple chances to see them she finds a way to avoid them. We live in the same

Pike Place Market seems neat, Needle, Museum of Flight, Pop culture museum, and maybe the boeing factory in everett looks like something we would be interested in.

I work at a really popular coffee chain, and my coworkers and I are all either really close, or they can turn their backs on you in an instant. 
I have two shift supervisors who have been dating for awhile, and recently broke up, we’ll call them A and B. I have gotten close to A since she had moved to our store. At the time I was close with another coworker who I’d frequently give a ride home to, we’ll call her K. K and I had a recent falling out, and it’s been tense on the floor ever since. 
I have shared some information with K off the clock while taking her home a few months ago regarding a situation between A and B. And I only shared it because I’ve been worried about how B is treating A. 
A also shares a lot of their relationship info with a few coworkers (including me) that really, we don’t need to know. She recently shared with me that they broke up. I haven’t said anything about that (and have no intention to) and I don’t know who else she’s told. 
K has a massive crush on B (even though K has a bf of her own, and B can’t stand her but she’s not aware of that). K often shares information to B to try and “be on his side and protect him” or whatever. 
The day that A and B broke up, B and K were closing and K decided to share information about what I was told a few months ago. B is super pissed about it, and wants to get me fired for sharing information with K. 
He already called my store manager explaining the situation, and my manager pulled me and another shift supervisor aside. I already asked why this is even an issue and why I’m the one getting blamed for it, when this was originally something that happened not at work, and K was the one who shared this information on the clock. Also, I didn’t even hear this information ORIGINALLY from A (who shared stuff with multiple people on the floor). I heard it from someone else before I heard it from her. 

Is this something I can genuinely get fired for? How can I protect my job going forward? Who should I talk to about this to cover my ass?

Mostly a lurker on reddit. I’ve been doing a somewhat modified version of Strong Lifts 5x5 for the last 6 months or so (I do front squats vs back, and also do weighted dips and weighted push ups). I’ve made really good progress generally. Lately, I’ve been having serious issues falling asleep on lifting days. I haven’t narrowed this down yet but it seems to be worse on the days I deadlift and squat. There are times when I start to fall asleep and then my heart rate seems to elevate and wake me again.

I already:
- limit caffeine to times before noon. Just one cup of coffee. Occasionally I have a diet coke. 
- Take melatonin, 0.3mg around midnight.
- Take mag glycinate, mag theronate, and glycine. Added L-Theanine recently… doesn’t seem to make a difference.
- not on creatine
- my pre workout is stim-free
- I try to be in the gym around 3/4. Some days it’s 5PM and I’m done around 7. Dinner is usually wrapped up around 8:30. I think this is partly an issue but even on days where i’m done earlier… the insomnia remains.
- Definitely getting enough calories because I have gotten fatter lol
- I walk 8-12 miles a day

I work from home most days so I can sleep till 9 if need be (thank god). But I won’t have this job forever and I really want to fix this. I like being up in the morning. 

I’ve read a lot of threads where people had the same issue, but seen little evidence of anyone resolving this.

I remember when I first started in 2023... I had these gorgeous photos from my time as a tour guide in Turkey, but my blog made them look like they were taken with a potato camera from 2005. The frustration was REAL.

Through countless cups of coffee and perhaps a few tears (okay, maybe more than a few), I've tested practically every theme that claims to be ""perfect for travel bloggers."" Some were pretty but slower than my internet in that remote Turkish mountain village I once stayed in. Others were fast but looked like they were designed in the early 2000s.

**Here's what I learned after wasting WAY too much time:**

# What actually matters in a travel blog theme:

1. **Speed matters more than fancy features** \- Those amazing animated headers? They'll kill your page load time and send visitors bouncing faster than you can say ""wanderlust""
2. **Mobile-first is non-negotiable** \- 78% of travel research happens on phones
3. **Customizability that doesn't require a PhD in coding** \- Because who has time for that?

# The themes that actually delivered:

**Blossom Travel (Free and Pro)** 

Used this until March 2025. Perfect for beginners - I set up my entire site in one afternoon! Beautiful typography, built-in Instagram integration, and travel-specific features. The free version is somewhat limited though.

**Blocksy (My current love)** 

Switched to this last month and my site speed improved by 27%! The free version offers features most themes reserve for premium versions. I'm currently using Blocksy + Blocksy Companion + Stackable and it handles both my travel photography and fashion content beautifully. Small learning curve but totally worth it.

**Kadence** 

Honestly tried this briefly and felt overwhelmed as a non-techie, but many of my more tech-savvy blogger friends absolutely swear by it. The header and footer builder is apparently incredible.

**Astra** 

Speed champion. If your blog is super image-heavy and you're seeing loading issues, this might be your answer. Templates can feel generic without customization though.

# The plugins that changed my life:

Can we talk about how confusing it is to pick between page builders and block plugins? After trying both paths, here's the real talk:

If you're just starting out or prioritize speed, stick with Gutenberg blocks + helper plugins like Stackable or PostX. If you want more design freedom and don't mind a slight performance hit, try Elementor (but beware the rabbit hole of endless tweaking - I lost entire weekends to ""just one more adjustment"").

# The speed fix that doubled my mom's browsing time:

My site used to load so slowly my mom would literally call to complain (thanks Mom). The fix that worked miracles: I switched to Blocksy (lightweight heaven!), deleted those 7 plugins I barely used, ran all my photos through Smush, and added WP-Optimize.

My load time dropped by HALF! My mom can now browse my site without calling to complain about the loading time, which is the real victory here.

# What I wish I'd known two years ago:

""Pick a solid theme with room to grow, then focus on creating amazing content instead of endlessly tweaking your design.""

In my first year, I changed themes FOUR TIMES. Each switch meant hours of reconfiguring settings, reformatting posts that broke during the switch, and delaying actual content creation. The theme isn't what brings readers - your content is.

**My current recommendations based on your experience level:**

* **For beginners:** Blossom Travel Pro
* **For intermediate bloggers:** Blocksy + Blocksy Companion + PostX + Stackable blocks
* **For advanced users:** Kadence + Kadence Blocks or Astra + Elementor

1k3srtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1k3srtw/how_do_i_survive_in_a_world_without_my_sister/,How do I survive in a world without my sister?,"Cancer took my sister from us yesterday. She spent two years battling and a month in hospice and yesterday we said goodbye. Last night going to bed I thought I could handle this. I said we've all been chomping at the bit for so long that today we just needed to rest. We had enough warning that all the plans are made, the phone calls done, the forms signed. We have time to rest for a day. 

But I woke up just now and I'm lost. How do I even get out of bed? I told my other sister last night that we just do things one step at a time, focus on what comes next. That was easy when we were too tired to think. But how do I go pour myself coffee in a world without my sister? How do I watch TV in a world without my sister? How do I write my stories, create my art, take a shower in this world where she isn't? 

I know she'd want me to. And that helps. Also I REALLY need to pee, and that will get my out of bed. So that's a step. I should also clarify that I'm not about to go do anything to harm myself physically, but I am in danger of falling into a very, VERY dark depression.

I guess what I'm saying is that I knew, but didn't know, how deep this loss could go. Any advice is appreciated on how I get from one breath to the next without breaking apart. ",4,1745172756.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False
