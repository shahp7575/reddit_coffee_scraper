Currently, I have a real cheap, ~10L bag that has plenty of functionality but lacks space and compartments for me in reference to my previous hiking bags and mil spec bags. I really enjoy brands like Eberlestock, Oakley, Camelbak, Hazard 4, and 511.

-Ipad ‚ÄúIn the future‚Äù

-A couple types of trauma shears
-A knife
-Some office supplies
-A couple textbooks
-An extra set of scrubs
-A few meds
-A couple snacks and drinks 
-Personal care items and a small toiletry set

It is highly recommended that there be a cushioned pocket for my electronics, that‚Äôs my only request.

Picture this: You walk into the office, and there‚Äôs your AI assistant warming your seat‚Äîliterally. It‚Äôs a dramatic metaphor for the current business landscape, where AI represents not just technology but potential competition for our most human tasks. I mean, who thought ‚Äúartificially intelligent concierge services‚Äù would be a phrase we‚Äôd be throwing around with our morning espresso?

Meta, the social behemoth, is churning out AI like popcorn at a summer blockbuster, targeting not just your Fortune 500 types but those feisty small businesses too. Clara Shih from Meta claims that soon every business will have its very own AI sidekick. Maybe these AI agents won‚Äôt be brewing your coffee (yet), but they'll certainly be acting in your business's voice, handling customer queries, scheduling tasks, and maybe even negotiating deals better than any human intern on caffeine overload.

For small businesses, often operating on a shoestring and most definitely not rolling in AI research budgets, this proposition sounds like the ultimate life-hack. Give your precious time-consuming tasks to the bots! But will the ROI spell magic or mayhem? Though some larger corporations are treating AI as the coolest toy on the block, for many startups, it's a cautious game of wait-and-see. Can an AI agent really mimic the charisma of a seasoned salesperson or the strategic foresight of a crafty entrepreneur? That‚Äôs a question only time, and possibly a few wild AI experiments, can answer.

But here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîif every business adopts the same AI tech to automate customer interaction, will they all start to sound eerily similar? Could AI help small businesses thrive by bridging the resource gap, or will it flatten individuality in pursuit of efficiency?

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I started drinking caffeinated sodas around the age of 4 or 5.  I‚Äôm 48 years old now.  There was a brief six week period of time in middle school where I tried cutting out caffeine to see if it would help with some nervous ticks I have.  But to be fair I didn‚Äôt really cut it out completely as I was still eating chocolate candy bars.

But aside from that brief period, I have been a daily consumer of caffeine for most of my life.  This past August however, I had an epiphany.  I surmised that my chronic insomnia might be due to my daily coffee consumption.  I was basically drinking a pot of strong black coffee a day.  I figured it was fine since I only really drank coffee before noon.  But despite only drinking it in the morning, I would lie awake until 2 or 3 AM.  So I decided to quit.

Since August I‚Äôve significantly cut back on my caffeine intake and I‚Äôve noticed immediate benefits.  My sleep quality has vastly improved.  I also feel my energy is far more stable and consistent.  I‚Äôve gone as long as two weeks at a time completely caffeine free, but then I‚Äôll give in and have a cup of coffee and regret it because I‚Äôll be up all night again.  Then I‚Äôll do decaf for a few days and eventually go back to completely caffeine free.

Well, today that cycle stops.  I‚Äôve decided to be 100% caffeine free from now on.  The benefits of being caffeine free far outweigh the ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù of caffeine.  Here we go.  At least I don‚Äôt need to go through the headache phase again.  That was awful.",1,1741319304.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

CONTEXT:

i guess i just need some assurance that i‚Äôm doing the right thing- everyone i‚Äôve talked to about how he treats me has agreed that it‚Äôs unethical and that he‚Äôs not following proper protocol or decorum in many aspects of his management, i‚Äôm just so torn on whether it‚Äôs more worth it to quietly leave or to try and report it. i want so badly to enjoy this job that i love, to spread the joy i get to bring to people with coffee and sweet treats and a smile and a conversation- and i‚Äôm not being given the support that i need to succeed and it‚Äôs making me dread going into work.

tl;dr : i‚Äôve been advised by another store manager, as well as by ethics and compliance, to bring various concerns about my manager to my DM. i am very scared to do so because i feel like i won‚Äôt get anywhere and he‚Äôll just crack down harder. is it worth it chat?",1,1741319047.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

Got back to smelbourne a couple of days ago, so i thought id write this down for folks wanting to wander round and check shit out.. might save someone else a struggle to find places and so on.

I had to help out Dad a bit at the hospital, but there was a bit of time to check out things while waiting on phone calls back and so on, so i explored some too.

Going to Castletown or Stocklands was for the most part like every other shopping center you can head into round the place... a lot of the same shops with the same stock... hence why i asked for 'rock / goth / hippy' shops, as they tend to have differently sourced things.

Couple of things ive been looking for: A decent leather belt with two roles of holes and a double buckle, books as always, and some interesting small gifts for mum and the olds.  
  
Buses werent too bad to get around on, just took a while to get where ever. Most drivers where friendly, same as the peeps on the bus. Ticket system is ye olde school, but goes. The weekly ticket (5 bucks) looked a bit ratty after just under a week, but drivers didnt really look.



Was probably gunna dribble more for this, but eh... you get the idea. Ill prolly reply a bit anwyays.



CBD - 

Tee Shirt World - Flinders st, CBD - Lots of Ts, some shirts, grabbed a decent bamboo shirt in larger size... and theres plenty of much larger sizes there. Theres also typical tourist koalas and so on... plus roo balls.

3-4 Op shops - Flinders St - Right next to the Tee Shirt Shop, a few Op shops, then an antique store. Not a bad wander, items will change as they do... all tidy and clean.

Townsville Records - Flinders st - Just behind Nightowl, on a small mall - cosy record shop, bit of everything, grunge posters and so on... was playing two tone ska while i popped in, the bloke running it looked like he was a 'oi'. 

Mary Who - Bookshop - Flinders st - New books, bit of the same standard books youll see at the airport, plus extra sections of specialised books. Worth a look.

Rock Ape Records - Sturt St, CBD - Up the stairs, go right up the back, next to a tattoo shop. Packed with lots of metal stuffs... plenty of shirts, masks, patches, badges, record, CDs... even cassettes. Nice dude.

Bohemian Crystal Emporium - Flinders St - Lots of different crystals, interesting jewelry, acessories, ... and the toughest guard dog youll ever meet!

Xtasy - Flinders st - Adult store - Didnt buy any adults here, but seems like theres lots of clothes and such for bedroom roleplay and/or strippers. Standard friendly guy at the counter. Plus didnt feel sleezy, a bit more like a glamour place. A bit of leathergoods here, some hens/bucks party stuff too.

Would of liked to get a belt made from him, but i didnt have enough time.. might have to order. Pop in for a squizz. Other than that, fairly typical small adult store.  


Cupids Cabin - Next to Valhalla, Nathans road - A bit packed standard adult store. Some hand made leather goods... got a small bondage bear from here... thought he was cute.

1j5efe9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1j5efe9/something_about_this_school_just_makes_me_feel_so/,Something about this school just makes me feel so lonely,"Something about this school just makes me feel so lonely. I feel like I sound so childish but senior year was genuinely so much fun and I think I took it for granted. In the beginning, I put a lot of effort to try and make friends during freshman orientation and joining way too many clubs, expecting to find my people but that hasn't been the case at all. My roommates are also random so that was my way of trying to meet new people by going random because I felt I would be the type to be chill with most people, worst case, we just coexist---and yeah right now, we just coexist. We don't have anything in common and I talk to them every now and then but they are closer to one another (I'm their random, but they're friends beforehand), so I feel left out, which I don't mind so much, just not the most ideal situation.

Anyways, I have a weekly routine of 2-3 clubs I'm committed to, so overtime I was able to find the ones I cared more about and drop the ones I didn't resonate with which is good. Other than that, I also don't feel close to anyone at my clubs. We will talk, and it'll be fun and fine, but these club friends are not people I see myself spending my days with. I guess one thing I'm still adjusting to is just the lack of routine across each day of the week. In high school, I meet up with my friends everyday during lunch, we go home together, and hang out on the weekends. Here, everyone has their own schedules and we set times to have lunch, dinner, hang out, etc. I hope I don't sound like I'm complaining but I personally like spontaneous hangouts where it kinda goes ""where you at, lets meet up right now"" kinda vibes just because its the most convienet to know when you're available at that exact moment when you are available, if that makes sense. Having a lunch planned 3 days ahead where I have to add to my google calender to ensure I don't forget is still such a weird feeling to me. It almost feels like another task/meeting/coffee chat I have to go to, not like a casual meet up with a friend.

Even though I have people I would consider friends here, there's no one I feel especially attached to. The person I'm closest to here is my friend from high school and my brother who also goes here. No one I met here really means all that much to me. And it hurts to know it goes the same both ways. It makes me feel small and insignificant.

I really miss my friends from high school and I wish they came here with me, although in the beginning I was being optimistic and seeing this as an opportunity to no longer rely on others to make friends but to do so on my own. But not gonna lie, my most meaningful friendships are almost always people I already knew, or mutual friends lol.

Also, my main point I wanted to make with this post is how I feel so disconnected from everyone here. I don't feel I am particular good at a specific subject so study sessions make me feel guilty because I can't provide much help to my peers, so I don't really study with anyone. Then, during clubs, there are times when I feel fine, but other times when I make my best effort to get to know others. asking them questions, and trying to start a conversation just to get to know one another and pass the time, it seems there's about a 50% chance they'll just be completely indifferent to our conversation. GIve dry responses, not asking questions back or keeping the conversation going, not putting much effort into talking to me. Granted, most of the time things are okay...but when it is just clearly a one sided conversation I'm trying to keep going it makes me so frustrated and sad. I get not everyone wants to be friends, but is it so hard to be friendly? I may just be sensitive but it has been bugging me recently since it has been happening more often. It hurts because I would love to get to know you more and am genuinely curious about what you have to say, yet you don't put in your share to ask a bit about me or keep the conversation going. In such a big school, there are also a lot of people I think I will just never get along with. I'm not big on large social gatherings or greek life, but am down for just restaurant hopping and study sessions (oops I'm contradicting myself a bit here), but it just seems if we are not similar right off the bat, no one cares anymore. I'm not sure how to explain it exactly but my point being, I feel so disconnected and insignificant and it hurts when it feel like hardly anyone cares to get to know one another. I guess I also miss the tightness of my high school class, class size was maybe like 500 but most people knew each other. I don't know...am I the only one who feels this way.

I am of course in full hazmat and proper protective equipment the entire time. The thing is, I‚Äôve found something. It‚Äôs a terminal, like the ones on all of the floors, except 19, 19‚Äôs terminals are entirely mechanical, for obvious reasons. This terminal is old, maybe the first. It wasn‚Äôt turned on when I found it, I had to track the conduits to the nearest Fission Cell, the mitochondria of the Task Force. Once I removed all the caution tape and established a connection, I was able to power up the old terminal. It hummed to life as I flipped the switch, reverberating a deep and resonant buzz that made my heart race under the pressure of my ribs closing in on it, like I said, just like the rest, except 19. When I could breathe again, I entered my personal log in. For absolutely no reason I can think of, it denied me access. Luckily, Fredo left his password in the bathroom last week, scrawled into the stall under the typical phrase, ‚ÄúFor a weird time, call‚Ä¶‚Äù. I enter Fredo‚Äôs username and phone number, gaining access to the hidden cache in mere hours. This gave me time to get out of the fall out and relax for a while.	  
I‚Äôve been playing high stakes hide and seek with the Squonk that works in the Pre-Temporal Distortion Detection Annex. If I spy them first, well, puddle. But if they spot me first, I have given them permission to liquify me at their earliest convenience. I feel this is actually a pretty safe bet, considering the entire annex was caught up in a time storm this morning. So I dropped off my latest reports on the material make up of the coffee in break room 3 and fed the fish in Christian‚Äôs lab. Those things are so cute, too bad they used to be people‚Ä¶  
The buff scientists say they‚Äôve whipped up new hazmat gear. I wanted to try it until I heard what happened to Hank. Poor guy. There‚Äôs a card in the west foyer if you wish to send your condolences. Sneaking past Trevor‚Äôs office isn‚Äôt hard. Even though it‚Äôs all windows, he recently covered them all with cork board to ‚ÄúSpin a web of truth and lies, where the line between can and should blurs to an opulent gray pudding for me to consume and digest.‚Äù A true inspiration. When I got back to the terminal it was fully powered up, you can tell by the way your teeth tickle. I‚Äôve discovered multiple archives that are all several zettabytes, there‚Äôs no way I can go through all of this alone.¬†  
If you have the time and aren‚Äôt afraid of the hallway behind Trevor‚Äôs office, come on by and enter Alfredo‚Äôs login and phone number. I will start with the archive labeled ‚ÄúProtocol And The Lack Thereof In The Earliest Iterations‚Äù. Other files include, ‚ÄúA Fully Incomplete Record Of The Task Force Member Who Found The Second Basement Behind The Cistern‚Äù and ‚ÄúMore Explanations For What Happened In The 1860‚Äôs?‚Äù among many more.¬†  
Jillian just told me that the time storm in the PTDD Annex is wrapping up and should be done yesterday by the time noon rolls around. As far as she knows, the Squonk survived. So the game is afoot. If I don‚Äôt get liquified, I‚Äôll be posting my reviews of these archives directly on Christian‚Äôs chalkboard, in extra fine font. ¬†

However he seems to struggle to make eye contact with me, if we're talking standing up then he will often be facing at a right angle from me instead of face to face with me even, or just looking away.

Recently I asked if I could hug him after he was telling me about a topic that was very emotional. He seemed ok with it but it was one of those ""keeping your hips far apart hugs"" where he seemed to be trying to keep his body away from me, which tbh I've never experienced hugging any friend

We also mostly talk only during work meetings (he will share personal stuff but during 1-1 meetings) and he'll usually have some excuse if I suggest getting lunch or coffee during the work day. Whereas most coworker friends would be fine with it.

I also don't typically think of him as socially awkward. He has a lot of friends and seems confident in most social settings.

I haven't told my family or care team really what my goal is because I'm afraid they won't think it's good enough if that makes sense?

The gist of what I say is like ""I want to be able to live my life"" or ""be able to do things I used to be able to"" and while I'm not really lying, it's not really my goal. I know things aren't going to go back to what my normal used to be, I can't imagine being able to walk around the mall for a couple hours or take a little hike through the woods to get to the beach. 

One of my biggest issues with my pots is the fatigue and pain (I probably have cfs I'm trynna find out) and I'm at the point right now where I can't leave the house for a couple of hours because it's so taxing, even when I'm just going from the car ride to sitting in a coffee shop. 

My goal is to be able to go places in my wheelchair. I want to have the energy to be wheeled around comicon in cosplay, I want to be dependable enough to be in a play and wheel myself around the stage.

I think I'm being realistic, but I worry people would think I'm not being hopeful enough or something. It feels like my goals aren't what they ""should"" be. I feel like I should aim to not need a mobility aid and be energetic and pain free but it's just not likely to happen and I just want to enjoy my life.

We took him to a local park and walked around the trail a few times and he was acting totally normal. He met some people, saw other dogs at distance, sniffed every other blade of grass and just enjoyed the outdoors over all. We were out for about an hour or so.

We got home, and he got some water and went to the bedroom while we made some coffee. When we came to the room, we saw he had heavy white spit on his mouth and was wobbly. I thought he was choking, my fiance thought heart issues, but he quickly fell into a seizure fit and we rushed him to the vet. He had two or three more while in the vets office and never really came out of any of them fully. Hes now staying there overnight as they couldn't break the cluster yet. 

Now im not unfamiliar with epilepsy as I am an epileptic myself. But never seen it in dogs. I'm not familiar with this side of the deal, so I'm reaching out for anyone who can advise me on... what now? How do you do with a dog that just suddenly has epilepsy?

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I am lucky in that I can generally fall asleep very quickly, but I wake up during the night and can't go back to bed. I try to avoid looking at my phone but sometimes if it feels like it's been an hour, I'll look at it's 3:30am or 4am. I usually stay in bed because I feel tired enough to fall back asleep, but I just don't. I've been trying all the good sleep hygiene things like only using my bed for sleep, not looking at screens 30 minutes before bed, only one cup of coffee per day (and before 6am), blackout curtains. I run for at least 90 minutes every morning. I've been taking 400mg of magnesium citrate (I also tried magnesium glycinate but that didn't work and I read that it can have opposite effects) and 1500mg of valerian about an hour before bed. I worry that if I didn't take the magneisum and valerian, it would be worse, but obviously it's not solving the problem.

I've tried hydroxyzine (which just made me feel like a zombie without helping me sleep), melatonin, PLUS sleep CBN gummies, and olly extra strength, but none helped. I've talked to my doctor and she wants me to try trazodone but I don't want to feel the same way I felt with hydroxyzine.

I've been thinking about trying cognitive behavioral therapy but I'm having a hard time moving past the feeling that it will just be a waste of time. I'm not even that anxious about anything in particular - my mind just really likes thinking about work things while I'm lying in bed, but I'm not thinking about anything stressful. Just thinking nonstop.

Part 1,"I already know what ya'll are thinking....not another damn perspective of the guy role-playing as a cat online.  Just hear me out okay.  It's much worse than you thought. These people are nuts!!

It all started one day about three years ago.  I had just moved into this home that had a guy, a lady, their daughter, and a cat. I'm not the biggest fan of cats but I can deal with them.  Sometimes it's the people that you really have to worry about.  Anyways, the humans seemed okay at first. They dropped a lot of food on the floor so I'm thinking this is going to be great for me.  Well I would soon learn how wrong I was.

The first few weeks went by just fine.  I pretty much went unnoticed in the house. Only the cat knew I was there but he didn't even care.  We actually became buddies and would sometimes sunbathe together in the light coming from the window.  I think the cat was just glad to have a companion to hang out with when the humans weren't home. One day the daughter did see me as i was scavenging for lunch. She didn't get scared or freaked out or anything like that. She said hi and told me that I was a very cute mouse. After that she started leaving me leftovers from dinner on a little plate underneath the coffee bar.  A couple times a week I would get milk and cookies too. I really liked her.

Now here is where all the trouble started.  One day I came out for food and noticed that the house was very quiet.  I was about to check all my usual places when I saw the guy on his hands and knees in front of the cat bowl.  And he was eating the food!!  At first I was like ""What the hell?"" It was so strange to me to see a human eating cat food.  The lady was a great cook and there was always human food around so that made it even more confusing.  Anyways, I looked over at the cat and he was just watching the guy.  He looked just as confused as I was. The cat eventually looked over at me and he said ""I hope he is going to save some of that for me.""

The guy started eating the cat food multiple times a week but only when no one else was home.  It was still a strange thing to see but after a while I just shrugged my shoulders and thought to myself ""whatever floats your boat.""  Now one day the humans had made one of those charcuterie board things but it had accidentally gotten knocked over.  The food went everywhere!!  There was cheese all over the floor....like so many different cheeses!! It was wonderful!!  

I went back out into the kitchen for my second round of cheese when the guy caught me.  I thought for sure he was going to kick me out but I was wrong.  Instead he loudly proclaimed ""Jerry"" and started chasing me around the kitchen. I thought to myself, ""Who the hell is Jerry? My name is Gloria!!""  He started doing this every time he caught me looking for food.  Sometimes he would meow or hiss at me. He even started to refer to himself as Tom. (His name is NOT Tom.)  

This nutcase even went out and bought himself a small toy plastic hammer to chase me with.  He never actually hit me with it but there were some close calls.  After the fifth time of this cat and mouse game I was done.  I started leaving little poop droplets on his pillow while he slept.  After a whole week of waking up with turds stuck to his hair and face ""Tom"" finally stopped chasing me around the kitchen.  We had come to an understanding.

Apparently, it's a variant of ""quiet quitting,"" where a person shows up but does the absolute minimum, detaching themselves from any commitment or engagement in the job. ""Coffee badging"" involves physically clocking in, but then wandering away to the breakroom, the bathroom, the lobby, a deserted conference room, your car, or even back to your home, then coming back to the office just in time to physically clock out. 

A coworker has been doing this. Information was second-hand but very credible.

 I've been documenting since the beginning of the school year that child's OP hasn't been administering inhaler. I always make sure to remind and ask that they give it and it's almost always not being used. I have photo proof of the chamber count not moving and child comes back with cough and nose issues. OP forgot about taking child to pulmonary appointment back in Nov and then we had to wait until Jan for the next opening. I had reminded them of upcoming appt and even had it posted on our co-parenting app. They did attend the one for Jan and OP admitted to doctor that he occasionally forgets to administer inhaler once or twice while child is in their care. Doctor told OP to ensure child gets inhaler so that we can verify its effectiveness.

Just a few weeks ago, child came back to me with a swollen and bruised dog bite. Child told me what happened and not OP. I took child to UC, was diagnosed with a hematoma but bite didn't break the skin. OP didn't take child to get bite checked and thought child was okay because they had stopped crying.

When child was recently returned to my care, inhaler was not administered at all again, even though I mentioned the bad air quality alert we got for our area. OP claimed they had been using a spare they had for the entire month. When I asked for the chamber count, the inhaler had somehow been ruined by the stove/oven when he opened the door. So there was no way to verify his claim. I noted down that I always send the inhaler that is in child's bag (that he's aware of) and he said child had only gone without inhaler on Sunday. The inhaler, in bag could've clearly been used for Sunday and Monday dosages.

  
Other noted issues (not sure if it matters):

 \-OP mentioned child had bloody, waxy ears (ear tubes are in both ears due to chronic ear infections). I asked if they were going to get child checked out at UC, they said no. I called ENT, they prescribed ear drops and reached out to OP to pick up prescription. Child was confirmed for ear infection by PED after returning to me for appt. Ear infection last around 2-3weeks with continuation of ear drops and then oral antibiotics.

\-While in OP's care, child slipped on water and fell on edge of coffee table, causing eyebrow to spilt open. Child taken to ER and had stitches placed.

My coffee is always as good as I expect a Starbucks Americano to be. Recently my Starbucks seems to have had an influx of new hires, and yesterday my Americano tasted awful. Like, burnt, and just kinda off. So I was like whatever, I need caffeine, so I drank it, and proceeded to get extra zooted from it for whatever reason. 

So today I went back to get my same drink - I literally had forgotten how gross my drink was yesterday and so when I took my first sip I was yet again surprised to taste how gross it was. Pretty frustrating. So, naturally, I drank it, cuz I need my caffeine, and proceeded to get extra zooted, yet again.

And then it got me thinking- are they making my Americano by just repulling my shots? Like, I have a nespresso at home and I‚Äôll do this for my own shots, knowing it‚Äôll water down a little but still get me some more espresso.

So like is that a thing? Instead of topping my espresso shots off with water, is some new person there just running my shots until my cup is full? Cuz I‚Äôm definitely getting the feeling that there was more caffeine in there than usual, and that maybe could explain how gross it tasted.

Part One: The Laundromat
A First-Hand Account by Evan Wren
¬†
‚∏ª
¬†
I never really believed in ghosts, demons, or any of that paranormal crap. I figured most weird encounters could be chalked up to sleep deprivation, paranoia, or someone just being a plain old liar. But after what happened that Saturday, I don‚Äôt know what to believe anymore.
¬†
The day started off normal enough. It was my first real weekend off in weeks, and I was making the most of it‚Äîby doing absolutely nothing. I had my feet propped up on my crappy coffee table, watching reruns of some cooking show I didn‚Äôt even care about. My phone buzzed a couple of times, work emails that I ignored.
¬†
I work IT for a local grocery chain. Nothing glamorous‚Äîmostly just driving around from store to store fixing busted checkout machines, resetting servers, and dealing with managers who think turning something off and on is wizardry. It pays the bills, keeps me moving. But on Saturdays, I am off the clock.
¬†
Except, of course, for the mountain of dirty laundry staring at me from across the room.
¬†
I sighed, knowing I was out of socks and down to my last halfway-clean shirt. No way around it‚ÄîI had to do laundry. My apartment, 305B, was on the far side of the complex, which meant I had to walk through the field that separated my building from the main office where the laundromat was. I grabbed my basket, stuffed it full of clothes, and headed out.
¬†
The sun was starting to dip, washing the sky in shades of orange and purple. I liked this time of day, when everything felt a little quieter. As I stepped into the field, the dry grass brushing against my legs, I got this‚Ä¶ odd feeling. Not quite fear, but like someone had just stepped into the room behind me when I hadn‚Äôt heard the door open.
¬†
Then I heard the whispers.
¬†
At first, I thought it was the wind. The way it moved through the trees lining the far edge of the field, it could‚Äôve easily been some trick of the air. But as I walked, the whispers grew clearer. Low, hushed voices, speaking too fast for me to understand. Not just one voice‚Äîseveral, overlapping, like a conversation happening just out of earshot.
¬†
I stopped walking.
¬†
The voices stopped too.
¬†
I glanced over my shoulder. Nothing but the empty field and the dim glow of the apartments behind me.
¬†
I exhaled, shaking my head. It‚Äôs nothing. Just my brain playing tricks on me, right?
¬†
I picked up the pace and pushed through the laundromat door, letting the familiar scent of detergent and stale air replace whatever weirdness I just imagined outside.
¬†
I grumbled to myself when I saw the prices had gone up again. $3.25 a wash? Seriously? I fished a couple of crumpled bills out of my pocket, stuffing them into the change machine.
¬†
That‚Äôs when I noticed I wasn‚Äôt alone.
¬†
At first, I thought it was just another tenant‚Äîa man, maybe, sitting on the plastic bench near the dryers. But something was‚Ä¶ off. The way they sat, perfectly still. Their posture was too rigid, their hands folded neatly in their lap. Their face was turned just slightly away, obscured by the dim lighting.
¬†
And then they spoke.
¬†
‚ÄúEvan Wren.‚Äù
¬†
I froze. I hadn‚Äôt told them my name.
¬†
I turned toward them, trying to get a better look, but the flickering fluorescent lights above made it hard to focus.
¬†
‚ÄúYou always forget to separate your whites and darks,‚Äù the person said. Their voice was calm, casual‚Äîlike we‚Äôd been having a conversation this whole time. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll regret that in about thirty minutes.‚Äù
¬†
I stared. ‚ÄúDo I‚Ä¶ know you?‚Äù
¬†
A pause. The air in the room felt heavier.
¬†
‚ÄúI know you.‚Äù
¬†
Something about the way they said it sent a chill crawling up my spine. I wanted to laugh it off, call them a weirdo and go about my business. But my mouth was dry. I gripped my laundry basket tighter.
¬†
‚ÄúHow do you know my name?‚Äù I asked, forcing my voice to stay even.
¬†
They shifted slightly, but I still couldn‚Äôt make out their features.
¬†
‚ÄúYou drive a van,‚Äù they continued. ‚ÄúFix things. You were watching TV just now, thinking about getting something to eat. You heard whispers outside, but you told yourself it was nothing.‚Äù
¬†
That last part hit me like a punch to the gut.
¬†
I felt my stomach turn. ‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Äî‚Äù
¬†
‚ÄúI‚Äôd be careful if I were you, Evan.‚Äù
¬†
The voice was lower now, almost amused.
¬†
I didn‚Äôt answer. I just grabbed my change from the machine, shoved my clothes into the nearest washer, and slammed the lid down. My hands were shaking, and I didn‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôd mixed my whites and colors until the machine started.
¬†
I glanced back at the bench.
¬†
It was empty.
¬†
No one there. No sound of the door opening. Nothing.
¬†
I stood there for a solid minute, trying to make sense of what just happened. Maybe I was tired. Maybe I‚Äôd imagined the whole thing.
¬†
But when I stepped back outside, the field felt darker than before.
¬†
I didn‚Äôt bother waiting for my laundry to finish. I just walked straight back to my apartment, locked the door, and grabbed my keys.
¬†
I needed food. And maybe a drink.
¬†
Dollar General was still open.
¬†
Maybe some fresh air would help clear my head.
¬†
Part Two: The Empty Roads
¬†
A First-Hand Account by Evan Wren
¬†
‚∏ª
¬†
I don‚Äôt remember locking my apartment door. I assume I did‚ÄîI mean, I always do‚Äîbut my mind was running in circles, trying to rationalize what had just happened at the laundromat.
¬†
A prank? Maybe some neighbor screwing with me? But how would they know what I was watching on TV? Or that I heard the whispers?
¬†
I shook the thought off and climbed into my van.
¬†
I hadn‚Äôt planned on heading out this late, but the idea of just sitting in my apartment didn‚Äôt sit right with me. I needed to get out, be around people, maybe pick up something cheap and greasy to eat. Dollar General wasn‚Äôt far‚Äîmaybe a ten-minute drive‚Äîbut as soon as I pulled onto the main road, something felt‚Ä¶ wrong.
¬†
The streets were empty.
¬†
Not just quiet, but dead.
¬†
No cars parked along the curb. No porch lights on in the houses I passed. No distant sound of dogs barking or bugs humming. It was like the whole town had just decided to pack up and leave while I was in my apartment.
¬†
I checked the clock. 8:42 PM. Too early for everything to be this empty.
¬†
My hands tightened around the wheel. I kept my eyes on the road, watching for anysign of life. A car in the distance. A jogger. Even just someone stepping outside for a smoke.
¬†
Nothing.
¬†
By the time I pulled into the Dollar General parking lot, I was gripping the steering wheel like I was expecting it to steer itself into a ditch. The parking lot was mostly empty except for a single, beat-up sedan parked near the entrance. A couple of flickering lights buzzed overhead, casting sickly yellow halos on the cracked pavement.
¬†
I hesitated before stepping out. Checked my mirrors. Looked behind me.
¬†
No one.
¬†
I let out a breath, shook off the nerves, and headed inside.
¬†
The Girl at the Counter
¬†
The store was the same as always‚Äîdimly lit, slightly too cold, and smelling faintly of cleaning chemicals. One of those old, staticky radios played some pop song I half-recognized near the register.
¬†
Behind the counter stood a girl, maybe early twenties, scrolling through her phone. She had short, dyed red hair, a nose ring, and the kind of bored expression that told me she‚Äôd rather be anywhere else.
¬†
She glanced up when I walked in. ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù
¬†
I nodded back. Normal. Everything is normal.
¬†
I moved through the aisles, grabbing a pack of instant ramen, a bag of chips, and an energy drink. I kept looking up, eyes drifting toward the security cameras mounted in the corners of the store.
¬†
Every time I moved, the monitors flickered, showing distorted images for just a second too long.
¬†
I frowned and walked closer to the front, trying to get a better look at the monitors above the counter. The screens cycled through different views‚Äîthe empty aisles, the parking lot, the back storage room.
¬†
And then I saw it.
¬†
One of the screens showed me.
¬†
Not live footage. Not a reflection of where I was standing. It was me, standing in the laundromat, staring at the empty bench where the stranger had been sitting.
¬†
I blinked. The screen flickered. It was gone.
¬†
I turned to the girl behind the counter.
¬†
‚ÄúHey, uh‚Ä¶ do these cameras glitch a lot?‚Äù
¬†
She didn‚Äôt look up from scanning my items. ‚ÄúHuh? Oh yeah, all the time. They‚Äôre old as hell.‚Äù
¬†
I nodded slowly. Swallowed. ‚ÄúRight. Thought I saw something weird on them.‚Äù
¬†
She finally looked at me, raising an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYeah? Like what?‚Äù
¬†
I hesitated. Shook my head. ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù
¬†
She shrugged, scanning the energy drink. ‚ÄúYou okay, dude? You look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost.‚Äù
¬†
I forced out a laugh. ‚ÄúJust a long day.‚Äù
¬†
She gave me a half-smirk. ‚ÄúYou IT guys never sleep, huh?‚Äù
¬†
I fumbled for my wallet, but before I could pull it out, she waved a hand. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù
¬†
I blinked. ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù
¬†
She tapped the register. ‚ÄúI got it. You look like you need it.‚Äù
¬†
I stared at her for a second. A stranger, just casually paying for my drink because I looked off.
¬†
I exhaled, rubbing a hand over my face. ‚ÄúThanks. Uh, seriously. I appreciate it.‚Äù
¬†
‚ÄúNo problem,‚Äù she said, already looking back at her phone. ‚ÄúTry to get some sleep or something, yeah?‚Äù
¬†
I nodded and grabbed my bag, heading for the door.
¬†
The Stranger
¬†
The moment I stepped outside, I knew I wasn‚Äôt alone.
¬†
He was standing there, right beside my van.
¬†
The same figure from the laundromat‚Äîsame rigid posture, hands folded neatly in front of him. Only this time, the streetlights actually let me see him.
¬†
I wished they hadn‚Äôt.
¬†
His face was‚Ä¶ wrong. Like it was stretched too tight over his skull, too smooth, like someone had blurred out the details. His eyes were sunken, hollow pits of something that shimmered slightly, like oil on water.
¬†
I stopped mid-step, grip tightening around the plastic bag.
¬†
‚ÄúYou should listen carefully, Evan,‚Äù he said. His voice was the same as before‚Äîcalm, measured, like we were just two old friends catching up.
¬†
I swallowed. ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù
¬†
He tilted his head slightly. ‚ÄúNot what I want. What you need to do.‚Äù
¬†
My breath came out unsteady. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you talking about?‚Äù
¬†
He took a slow step forward. I didn‚Äôt move.
¬†
‚ÄúThe next forty-eight hours are going to determine whether or not you survive,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou need to prepare.‚Äù
¬†
A chill ran down my spine.
¬†
‚ÄúPrepare for what?‚Äù
¬†
His head tilted the other way, like he was considering his words carefully.
¬†
‚ÄúThey know you now,‚Äù he said simply. ‚ÄúYou heard them in the field. They know you‚Äôre aware.‚Äù
¬†
My stomach turned to ice.
¬†
‚ÄúI‚ÄîI don‚Äôt even know what I heard,‚Äù I said, my voice unsteady. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about‚Äî‚Äù
¬†
‚ÄúYou do,‚Äù he interrupted. ‚ÄúAnd whether or not you want to believe it, you‚Äôre involved now.‚Äù
¬†
I shook my head. ‚ÄúInvolved in what?‚Äù
¬†
The air between us felt too still. Like the world itself was holding its breath.
¬†
‚ÄúYou need to leave town,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTonight.‚Äù
¬†
I let out a nervous laugh. ‚ÄúYeah, okay. Sure. Let me just quit my job and hit the road, no big deal.‚Äù
¬†
He didn‚Äôt smile. Didn‚Äôt blink.
¬†
‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a joke.‚Äù
¬†
Something about the way he said it made my skin crawl.
¬†
I glanced over my shoulder, half-expecting the cashier to be watching through the window. But inside, the store looked normal. The girl was still at the counter, scrolling through her phone, oblivious.
¬†
I turned back to the stranger.
¬†
‚ÄúWhat happens if I don‚Äôt leave?‚Äù I asked.
¬†
His hollow eyes locked onto mine.
¬†
‚ÄúThen you‚Äôll find out what they do to people who listen to the whispers.‚Äù
¬†
The bag in my hand felt heavier. My heart pounded in my chest.
¬†
I opened my mouth to speak‚Äî
¬†
But he was gone.
¬†
Vanished.
¬†
Like he was never there.
¬†
I stood there, frozen, staring at the empty space beside my van.
¬†
The world around me was too quiet.
¬†
I didn‚Äôt want to go home.
¬†
But I didn‚Äôt know where else to go.
¬†
Part Three: The Hunt Begins
¬†
A First-Hand Account by Evan Wren
¬†
‚∏ª
¬†
By the time I pulled back into my apartment complex, the streets weren‚Äôt empty anymore.
¬†
People were out now‚Äîneighbors on their balconies, sitting on porches, walking their dogs. At first, I felt relieved. Maybe I‚Äôd just imagined it earlier. Maybe I was just freaking myself out.
¬†
But then I noticed something.
¬†
They weren‚Äôt just outside.
¬†
They were watching me.
¬†
A man sitting on a bench near the leasing office turned his head as my van rolled by, eyes locked on mine. A woman across the lot, mid-conversation on her phone, stopped talking and stared. On the second-floor walkway, an old man leaning against the railing turned his head just a little too slowly, tracking my movements.
¬†
No one smiled. No one waved.
¬†
Just watching.
¬†
I parked quickly and kept my head down, gripping my plastic bag like it was some kind of shield. Maybe I was just being paranoid. Maybe I was so worked up that I was seeing things that weren‚Äôt there.
¬†
I didn‚Äôt even fully shut my door before I was inside my apartment, locking it behind me.
¬†
I let out a breath and tried to shake the feeling off. Just make your food. Switch the laundry. Act normal.
¬†
The ramen took three minutes in the microwave. I ate standing up, barely tasting it. The whole time, I kept glancing at my dark TV screen, half-expecting it to turn on by itself again. It didn‚Äôt. Not yet.
¬†
When I went back to the laundromat to switch my clothes to the dryer, I kept my head down, refusing to look too hard at anyone. No one said anything to me, but I felt their eyes. The air was thick with it.
¬†
I loaded my clothes, shoved some quarters into the machine, and power-walked back to my apartment. Thirty minutes. That‚Äôs all I need. Then I can grab my clothes and figure out what the hell I‚Äôm doing next.
¬†
I was halfway across the field when I heard them.
¬†
Footsteps.
¬†
Behind me.
¬†
Not the casual, lazy steps of someone heading home. These were fast. Heavy. Getting closer.
¬†
I didn‚Äôt turn around. I didn‚Äôt need to. Every instinct in my body screamed RUN.
¬†
I bolted.
¬†
The laundry bag smacked against my side as I sprinted, my breath coming out in ragged gasps. The dry grass snagged at my legs. I could hear them behind me, their steps pounding the earth, closing the distance too fast.
¬†
My apartment was in sight. I just had to‚Äî
¬†
Something grabbed the back of my hoodie.
¬†
I yanked forward with everything I had, nearly choking myself in the process. The grip slipped, but I felt fingers scrape the back of my neck, ice-cold and too long.
¬†
I slammed into my door, fumbling with my keys, my vision swimming with panic. My hands were shaking too hard‚Äî
¬†
The footsteps stopped.
¬†
Silence.
¬†
I turned the key and practically fell inside, kicking the door shut and locking it in the same motion. My pulse was a war drum in my ears.
¬†
I pressed my back against the door, gasping for breath.
¬†
I waited. Five seconds. Ten.
¬†
Nothing.
¬†
I forced myself to move, creeping toward the peephole.
¬†
The field outside was empty.
¬†
My hands were still shaking as I grabbed a chair and wedged it under the doorknob. It wouldn‚Äôt stop someone from getting in if they really wanted to, but it made me feel better.
¬†
I staggered back to the couch, running a hand over my face. I can‚Äôt just stay here. I need to leave.
¬†
But that‚Äôs what the stranger said, right? Leave tonight.
¬†
If I packed up and took off, was I walking right into something worse?
¬†
I needed a plan.
¬†
I glanced around my apartment, trying to focus. I could grab my work laptop, get some cash from the ATM, maybe head‚Äî
¬†
My TV flickered on.
¬†
I jumped. The remote was on the coffee table, untouched.
¬†
The screen glowed white for a second before shifting to a news broadcast. A man in a suit and tie sat at a desk, reading from a teleprompter.
¬†
But something was wrong.
¬†
His skin was too smooth, like wax. His mouth moved a second after the words came out, like bad dubbing. And his eyes‚Ä¶ his eyes were solid black.
¬†
I couldn‚Äôt move.
¬†
I couldn‚Äôt breathe.
¬†
The anchor smiled‚Äîtoo wide‚Äîand said:
¬†
‚ÄúGood evening, Evan.‚Äù
¬†
The air left my lungs.
¬†
The man chuckled like I‚Äôd just told a joke. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had quite the night, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù
¬†
I wanted to turn the TV off. But I couldn‚Äôt move.
¬†
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt usually like to involve new players so quickly,‚Äù the anchor continued. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôve made quite the impression.‚Äù
¬†
His head tilted. The background behind him flickered‚Äîstatic, static, an empty street, static, my apartment complex, static.
¬†
‚ÄúThe hunt begins soon.‚Äù
¬†
My stomach twisted.
¬†
The man smiled again, his teeth stretching too far, gums black like oil. ‚ÄúYou should get some rest, Evan. You‚Äôll need it.‚Äù
¬†
The screen cut to static.
¬†
I lunged forward and yanked the plug from the wall.
¬†
Darkness swallowed the room.
¬†
I stood there, heart pounding, staring at my reflection in the blank screen.
¬†
Then, from outside‚Äî
¬†
A soft knock, knock, knock at my door.
¬†
I stopped breathing.
¬†
I turned slowly, the blood draining from my face.
¬†
Three knocks. The same as before.
¬†
I didn‚Äôt move.
¬†
Didn‚Äôt blink.
¬†
Then, a voice‚Äîmuffled, right outside the door.
¬†
‚ÄúRun, Evan.‚Äù

(END OF CHAPTER ONE.)

The Blackout Protocol

A First-Hand Account by Evan Wren

Chapter Two: No Way Out

‚∏ª

Part One: Run

The knock at the door wasn‚Äôt loud. It wasn‚Äôt aggressive.

But it sent a bolt of ice through my spine.

Knock, knock, knock.

The same rhythm as before. The same message.

And then‚Äîa whisper.

‚ÄúRun, Evan.‚Äù

My breath caught in my throat. My hands clenched into fists. Every part of my brain screamed at me to not open that door.

Then‚Äîanother knock. Softer. Urgent.

‚ÄúEvan, open up. It‚Äôs me.‚Äù

The voice was‚Ä¶ familiar.

I hesitated, then moved toward the peephole. My eye pressed to the cold glass, and‚Äî

Nia.

The cashier from the Dollar General.

She was alone, looking over her shoulder with quick, darting movements. Her body was tense, shifting on the balls of her feet like she was ready to sprint at any moment.

I hesitated, my heartbeat hammering in my ears.

Nia knocked again, harder this time. ‚ÄúEvan, please.‚Äù

Every instinct told me to ignore her. To stay locked in.

But something in her voice‚Äîthe sheer urgency‚Äîmade me reach for the lock.

The second the latch clicked back into place, she shoved the door open and nearly knocked me off my feet.

She slammed it shut behind her and spun, pressing her back against it like she expected someone to charge through any second.

Her brown eyes locked onto mine, intense, searching. ‚ÄúAre you real?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù I shoved her back, confused and on edge. ‚ÄúWhat kind of question is that?‚Äù

She reached out and pressed two fingers hard against the pulse point on my wrist. It wasn‚Äôt gentle‚Äîit was like she was checking for something.

‚ÄúAre you real?‚Äù she repeated.

I ripped my arm away. ‚ÄúOf course, I‚Äôm real!‚Äù

She let out a breath and took a half-step back.

I rubbed my chest where she‚Äôd pushed me. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?‚Äù

Nia turned toward the door, listening. The whole apartment had gone deathly quiet. No traffic. No night bugs. No TVs muffled through the walls.

Then, the whispering began again.

It started as a murmur, slithering in from the cracks around the doorframe. Then it grew. More voices. More layers. A hushed conversation happening just outside my door.

I didn‚Äôt understand the words. I wasn‚Äôt sure they were words.

Nia sucked in a breath through her teeth. ‚ÄúThey know I‚Äôm here.‚Äù

Her fingers dug into my wrist before I could ask what the hell that meant.

‚ÄúWe have to go.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt argue.

She yanked the door open.

And they were waiting.

Not standing in the hallway. Not visible.

But the air felt thicker, pressing against us like a living thing. And the whispers‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt sound distant anymore.

They sounded like they were coming from inside my walls.

Nia pulled me forward. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stop. Don‚Äôt look at them.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know who them was.

But I didn‚Äôt look.

We ran.

She led me down the stairs, through the parking lot, toward the maintenance gate at the back of the complex. I could hear soft footsteps following, moving in unison, just out of sight.

I made the mistake of looking back.

They were watching.

Not chasing. Not attacking.

Just standing in the open doorways of apartments. Behind cars. Peeking out from between the buildings.

A man in a suit stood under the flickering streetlight, his face smooth and unfinished, like an artist had given up halfway through sculpting him.

A woman in a nightgown was hunched behind a tree, her head tilted at an angle that shouldn‚Äôt have been possible.

My stomach turned to ice.

I faced forward and ran faster.

Nia shoved open the maintenance gate, pulling me through just as something lunged at me from the side.

I caught a glimpse of pale fingers, too many of them, reaching out from the darkness.

I didn‚Äôt scream. I just ran.

She slammed the gate shut behind us, locking them out‚Äîfor now.

We didn‚Äôt stop running until we reached my van.

She snatched the keys from my pocket before I could protest, unlocked the door, and shoved me into the passenger seat.

Then she peeled out of the parking lot like the devil himself was behind us.

‚∏ª

Part Two: The Huntkeeper‚Äôs Game

We didn‚Äôt speak for the first five minutes.

The van‚Äôs headlights cut through the darkness, but the town around us was wrong. Streetlights flickered. Houses sat dark and silent. There were no other cars.

It was like the whole town had paused.

Finally, I broke the silence.

‚ÄúHow do you know my name?‚Äù

Nia exhaled through her nose, keeping her eyes on the road.

‚ÄúThey said it.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Whisperers.‚Äù

The name sent an involuntary shudder through me.

She glanced at me briefly. ‚ÄúThey whisper to each other about the players. I heard them say your name before I saw you at the store.‚Äù

A pit formed in my stomach.

I licked my lips. ‚ÄúAnd yours?‚Äù

She hesitated. ‚ÄúThey said mine too.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt like the way she said that. Like it meant something worse.

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúSo, what is this? What the hell did I get dragged into?‚Äù

Nia sighed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in The Hunt,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd you weren‚Äôt supposed to survive this long.‚Äù

I clenched my jaw. ‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù

She drummed her fingers against the wheel. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a game. A ritual. You ever wonder why people go missing and no one remembers? Why the cops don‚Äôt do anything? Why the world just moves on?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because of him,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúThe Huntkeeper. He runs this thing. He picks the players. He sets the rules.‚Äù

I took a slow breath. ‚ÄúAnd the rules are‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou survive.‚Äù She glanced at me. ‚ÄúFor forty-eight hours.‚Äù

A weight settled in my chest.

‚ÄúSo I just run?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the normal game.‚Äù She hesitated. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs someone else. Someone messing with the rules.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

She licked her lips. ‚ÄúThe Huntkeeper keeps things tight. Local. Controlled. But they‚Äî‚Äù she swallowed‚Äî‚Äúthey like to stretch the game out. Make players run further. Across state lines. Across borders.‚Äù

I felt my stomach sink.

‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt supposed to make it out of your apartment,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúBut someone wanted you to.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Part Three: Signal Interference

The hum of the van‚Äôs engine was the only sound between us.

The town around us still felt off. Every street we passed was either too dark or too still‚Äîlike the buildings themselves were holding their breath.

I should‚Äôve been relieved that we‚Äôd made it out of the complex. That I wasn‚Äôt standing frozen in my living room, watching my television speak directly to me. But instead, I felt like we‚Äôd only made it to the next level.

Nia was gripping the steering wheel too tight.

She had this way of not blinking long enough to make me nervous‚Äîlike she was expecting something to materialize in the middle of the road at any second.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I started, my voice coming out rough. ‚ÄúYou were gonna explain why the hell my name is on the news.‚Äù

She took a slow breath but didn‚Äôt take her eyes off the road.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just on the news, Evan.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù

She tapped her fingers on the steering wheel, thinking. ‚ÄúIt means there isn‚Äôt a single person left in this town who won‚Äôt recognize your name. Or your face.‚Äù

The pit in my stomach grew.

She adjusted the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be looking for you. Regular people. Cops. Cashiers. Strangers you pass on the street. Everyone.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make any damn sense. Why would they care?‚Äù

Nia finally glanced at me. ‚ÄúBecause the broadcasts told them to.‚Äù

Before I could respond, the van‚Äôs radio clicked on by itself.

A sharp whine filled the air, like old dial-up internet booting up. Then‚Äî

‚Äú‚Ä¶Coming up next, an urgent update on Evan Wren, now considered armed and dangerous. If spotted, do not approach‚Ä¶‚Äù

I flinched.

The voice was smooth, sterile, that same rehearsed cadence every news anchor had. But something about it was‚Ä¶ wrong.

Then, another voice cut in‚Äîlow, distorted, unnatural.

‚ÄúThe frequencies shift. The puppets stir.‚Äù

My skin crawled.

Static washed over the speakers.

‚ÄúThey hear us. They obey. They wait for the command.‚Äù

The sound cut out.

I turned to Nia, my hands clammy. ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù

She clenched her jaw. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worse than I thought.‚Äù

She turned onto a side road, speeding toward the highway.

I tried to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúWhat was that supposed to be? Some kind of‚Ä¶ hacked radio signal?‚Äù

She exhaled shakily. ‚ÄúDid you ever wonder why the Hunt exists?‚Äù

I stayed silent.

‚ÄúThe government doesn‚Äôt just allow it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey use it.‚Äù

My throat went dry. ‚ÄúUse it how?‚Äù

She gripped the wheel tighter. ‚ÄúThe radio waves. The broadcasts. They‚Äôre not just news.‚Äù

I stared at her.

‚ÄúThey control people, Evan.‚Äù

The words sat in the air, wrong and impossible, but my gut knew better than to dismiss them.

I let out a weak laugh. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs insane.‚Äù

But I didn‚Äôt sound convinced.

‚ÄúEver hear of The Blackout Protocol?‚Äù she asked.

The name sent a sharp spike of something through me.

I hadn‚Äôt heard it before. Not really. But my brain reacted like it had.

Like I‚Äôd forgotten something important.

I rubbed my temples. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

Nia‚Äôs voice was quieter now. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a way to wipe people clean. To take anyone‚Äîmake them forget who they are. Then program them into something else.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt speak.

She kept going.

‚ÄúThey can make you kill and not even remember doing it. Make you hunt someone down and believe it‚Äôs your idea.‚Äù

A sick feeling twisted in my stomach.

‚ÄúAnd the Hunt?‚Äù I asked.

She swallowed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a testing ground.‚Äù

A silence fell over the van.

I couldn‚Äôt process it. Couldn‚Äôt accept it.

There were so many things that didn‚Äôt make sense, but at the same time, it explained everything.

The disappearances. The way people never seemed to notice the ones who went missing.

The Whisperers‚Äîthe ones who were already taken. The ones who listened to the signals.

I gripped the seat. ‚ÄúSo what? That means anyone listening to the broadcast could be turned into‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

I felt sick.

The van‚Äôs radio crackled again.

Then, the news anchor‚Äôs voice returned‚Äîsmooth, calm, waiting.

‚ÄúGood evening, Evan. Seven hours have passed.‚Äù

My skin crawled.

‚ÄúForty-one remain.‚Äù

Static swallowed the transmission.

Then, outside‚Äî

Streetlights popped, one by one.

A crowd stood in the road ahead. Silent. Waiting.

Pale faces. Dark eyes.

They weren‚Äôt Whisperers.

They were something else.

Their bodies stood stiff and unnatural, like puppets held up by invisible strings.

And their heads all turned toward the van at the exact same time.

The hair on my arms rose.

A ripple moved through them‚Äîlike something touched their minds all at once.

Then‚Äîthey started running.

Nia swore and spun the wheel.

We crashed through a rusted fence and onto a dirt road. The van jolted violently. I gripped the door, heart hammering.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre everywhere,‚Äù I gasped.

Nia floored it.

The last thing I saw before the road blurred past‚Äî

A figure, standing above the crowd. Taller. Watching.

Its arms were too long. Its face wasn‚Äôt a face at all. Just a blank void.

And then‚Äî

The TV inside a roadside gas station flickered to life as we sped past.

The news anchor smiled.

‚ÄúRun faster, Evan.‚Äù

Iced Coffee v1.0 https://brew.link/p/CICC

Since Aiden can‚Äôt do ratios more concentrated than 1:14, I knew there would need to be some extra steps. So I went for simplicity in that regard.

I wanted to follow Hoffman‚Äôs advice in both his iced pourover video and iced immersion video. The main takeaway was to increase extraction. 

In the immersion recipe, he recommended 2/3 brewing water and 1/3 ice, which worked perfectly for simplicity here: just halve your selected amount of water to get the amount of ice necessary.

I don‚Äôt remember the exact ratios, but a 1:10 ratio (coffee to brewing water, not total water) was somewhere in the middle of the iced pourover and iced immersion recipes. Again, that works perfectly for simplicity: simply double the recommended amount of coffee. Because of that, I don‚Äôt recommend going over ~850 as that could lead to overflowing the basket.

He recommended grinding a bit finer than your normal pourover grind size, so I went 2 clicks finer than my normal grind size for the coffee, on the ode w/gen 2 burrs.

That leaves temperature and number of pulses. Looking to increase extraction, I went with the highest temp possible for the bloom and lowered slightly to somewhat emulate kettle heat loss.

With the Aiden, increasing the number of pulses essentially increases agitation. So I went with 10 to get max agitation.

The result is a pleasant iced coffee with clear tasting notes. I brewed the switch recipe from Hoffman‚Äôs immersion video earlier today and the cups were comparable, with a slightly more acidic top note from the Aiden cup.

I think it‚Äôs at least a good jumping off point. I will definitely be using this profile again.

Fellow, if you see this: like the cold brew setting, maybe we could get an iced coffee setting to allow for some more concentrated ratios and more pulses?",6,1741314684.0,FellowProducts,2,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\

I'm well versed in these devices but I'm kind of at my wits end with my mum's one. She uses the same coffee i do.  In the same grinder with the same setting as mine... Everything's the same. My coffee is perfect every time however for some reason her grinder keeps getting clogged up and I'm referring to every use here...


I clean it out completely from go to whoa using pipe cleaners and brushes and everything but as soon as I begin grinding coffee it immediately clogs at the chute and then clogs at the conical burr grind part where the ground coffee then spins and spins eventually ""forcing"" the ground coffee out of the exit hole after it's been overground from being clogged up.... 


In case what I've just written makes no sense, grinder has been cleaned fully. Dismantled and brushed out entirely. Reassembled. You then grind coffee... Nothing comes out for about 10 seconds then after a while then coffee grounds start to ""drizzle"" through but it's only coming out at all because the chute has gotten so clogged that it's just falling out the bottom....

Glass Ceilings & High Heels: 30 Women Who Mean Business,"Reading 30 Women in Power felt like sitting across from some of India‚Äôs most incredible women and trying not to spill my coffee in awe. Each story pulled me in‚ÄîCEOs, politicians, and trailblazers who didn‚Äôt just break ceilings but bulldozed right through them. I found myself rethinking my career choices, and occasionally wondering if I should start waking up at 5 AM. Some stories made me want to take notes, others just made me want to cheer. Naina Lal Kidwai keeps it engaging, though a bit of corporate-speak sneaks in here and there. 
It occasionally feels a bit too polished, with some stories skimming over struggles and failures in favor of neat success narratives. A little more vulnerability and behind-the-scenes grit would have made these journeys even more relatable.

But I found many coffee shops in Adelaide seem relatively smaller than the cafes of where I am from.
So I kinda become self-councious staying at a coffee shop more than an hour.
(I don't want to take seats from other potential customers)

So are there any large enough coffee shops that has enough seats for everyone so they don't get bothered by customers who stay for a couple of hrs?

I am at cbd, and I would appreciate even more if the coffee actually tastes good too.

So far I only found one large place called Hey darling espresso..

they were nice and I am gonna visit again but
I want to visit ALL the good ones. :)

thank u
