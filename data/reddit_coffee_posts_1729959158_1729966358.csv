I have come to beable to notice this middle grown. For example, today started off really well. I was able to get to a 12-step meeting. Socialize. Drink coffee. Then I went to the gym and slow started to notice the depressive thoughts creep in. ""If only I was X."" Or ""If only I had done Y"". I could then sense the psychological effects of depression. The heaviness. The sleepiness. The not caring. I ended up calling a friend to see how they were doing to stave off the desent. It helped for that 30 minutes. Then I thought I could post here to see if anyone had ever noticed/related to that ""middle grown"" or tipping point.

i'm truly losing the fight and i'm failing at everything, i'm so desperate not to live like this anymore, i know nicotine isn't great for your health, but its a stimulant similar to the amphetamines used in meds, people have mentioned nicotine helping them focus, so i'm asking for more detail from people who used it while they didn't have meds.

i've vaped before with my friends, and i keep one currently which i only use once a week, preferably with friends. but i experimented yesterday with using it to help me study because i was having so much trouble sitting there and doing work, i tried to take small short hits every few minutes, with the goal of having a mild prolonged buzz, and it worked so well, i felt so focused my mind was quite and completely pointed at what i was doing, it also made me tired in the way coffee does. 

it really helped me get work done, but i'm want to hear if you guys have experienced the same, just to check if its a placebo, i'm really hezitant to start using nicotine regularly, because i'm worried about becoming addicted, and the health affects, and i'm worried i might get tolerance and lose the positive effects. if i were to use nicotine regularly i think i'd do it in the form of gum or patches to try and minimise the health risks and also slow the high to something prolonged and mild.",1,1729966208.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

Im a 28 year old guy who only experienced long term relationships. I never went on a date like the ones were you know them from the apps or meeting them only once.

My relationships came from me just beeing friends, spending time to toghether often over weeks etc and then suddenly they start dropping hints. I was often obviously but found them attractive anyway and then just went with it. That resulted in a 8 year and one 2 year rl so far.

Now I am single since 2 years, healing from my 8 year rl. I got on the apps and had a few dates recently but they lead to nothing. Like usually we walk and talk have a coffee and then part ways after ~2h. 

Flirting is hard too I keep it as simple as complimenting them if something catches my eyes.

I'm done pretending that there isn't evil in this world. We're told from a young age that ""cruelty breeds cruelty"", when in actuality that isn't true at all.

What is an evil person? It's those that have grown up with extreme wealth in loving families, that have many, many friends. Those that have never dealt with depression, anxiety, money troubles, bullying, trauma, loss, abuse etc. I'm talking about those people who have NEVER had a worry in the world, the biggest inconvenience to them would be getting their name wrong on a Starbucks coffee.

So with all this privilege and wealth, why the fuck do they CHOOSE to be horrible people!?!? I just can't wrap my head around it. Why be so unkind and awful to others that are less fortunate?

I'm sick of the excuses people make in this case like ""they're jealous, that's why they take it out on people."" That's bullshit!! They have everything they could ask for, so what do they have to be jealous of??

This is why I'm fully convinced that these types of people are just pure evil.",1,1729966121.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

It was good till covid hit, from then on I am hearing stories like gamers have bought their own PCs and consoles and only those who want to play with friends visit gaming cafes.

Also, constant upgrades and repairs are eating profitability of this business. Like I upgraded 2 of my PCs a couple years ago and increased its pricing to Rs. 60 from normal PCs (Rs. 50/hr). Old systems are old specs I know (1050ti, 8GB ram, i5...) but Valorant is what most gamers play and it gets 200fps on these machines.

But people chose old systems and don't play on upgraded PCs because of price upgrades so I got demotivated to upgrade rest of the PCs too.

Also, constant repairs/replacements are needed for controllers, keyboards, mices, headphones is there.

I did some calculations and found that coworking spaces which offer just furniture, AC halls, and unlimited coffee start at same pricing as my gaming cafe. So what is the point of investing into expensive setup when all I need is a coffee machine? Furniture and AC and all are already there (I know furniture needs to re-jigged).

I can't increase my pricing as customers won't pay and stop coming. I have seen that in past.

Early in the morning I roll up to the one nearest my fav coffee shop and find that all but one spot is completely empty and free. YES! I can charge in peace while enjoying a light roast.

WRONG. A Model Y owner immediately pulls into the one and only stall that I could‚Äôve backed into without taking up two stalls (one of the larger ones) and rushes to plug in while staring me down. He had all these other stalls and it wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference on his end if he chose any of the others.

Oh great here we go.

There are 9 other stalls so I just pull into one at the end FULLY READY to unplug if I end up taking up the last free spot. I‚Äôm there for 20 mins and only 2 more Teslas pull into a couple of the empty stalls during that time so there‚Äôs still at least 6 other stalls left for other people who would need em.

Dude in the Model Y keeps getting in and out of his car, visibly agitated and at one point starts pointing his phone at my Rivian, without question he‚Äôs taking pics. I don‚Äôt say a word and I keep minding my own biz. Then he walks up to my passenger side window and tells me ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt take up two spots like that.‚Äù To which I replied, ‚ÄúI agree with you that it‚Äôs not ideal but I‚Äôm also ready to immediately unplug and pull out of this spot if the extra one that I‚Äôm taking up becomes the last one. At the moment it looks like there are multiple empty stalls and I should be out of here in less than 10 mins. I‚Äôm only charging to 70%.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is still unacceptable‚Äù he replied and continued to take photos of me with my windows down and backs up to take another few shots of the full view of my Rivian taking up the extra spot while being plugged into one of them.

This makes me not want to use Tesla Supercharging stations at all now if I can help it. I just wanted to try it out this one time so that I could familiarize myself with it for when I‚Äôm on a long road trip and have no choice but to use one. Well‚Ä¶ suffice it to say that I‚Äôve def familiarized myself alright‚Ä¶ familiarized myself with the tribe of haters that just want to be angry at Rivian/other car owners.

So, every time I start idly trying to think about what‚Äôs going on in Fromville, I keep coming back to this interview with creator John Griffin, who cites 9/11 as an inspiration for the show:

---------------

https://www.tvgoodness.com/2022/04/21/john-griffin-talks-epixs-from/

Griffin says the idea for the show was seeded in the aftermath of 9/11.
‚ÄúThat was the first time, for me, that I realized that there is no permanence to the world that we live in. There is no permanence to these constructs that we invest in and that we rely on,‚Äù he explains.
‚ÄúI remember in the aftermath, people, myself included, were looking around, walking around, [asking], ‚ÄòWell, what does everything mean now? What do I do?‚Äô And later on, looking back on that experience, I realized that, like so many other people, I had yet to go on that journey of self-discovery that would‚Äôve allowed me to say, even in the absence of all that, even as the world falls apart, ‚ÄòThis is still who I am.'‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was that moment in our lives that we all experienced differently. Sometimes it‚Äôs the loss of a loved one, where your entire world has shattered. And yet the rest of the world, other people, are still paying bills and buying coffee.‚Äù

------------------------

I wouldn‚Äôt be so hung up on it if Griffin didn‚Äôt cite it as the event that seeded the idea for the whole show. I saw a few other threads positing the idea that the monsters are all former inhabitants of the town, which I‚Äôm inclined to agree with. Did all of these monsters suffer some collective catastrophic event sometime in the 50s or 60s (based on their clothes) and now they‚Äôre wandering around zombie-like as a result? I don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs even a 1:1 correlation necessarily, but I can‚Äôt get Griffin‚Äôs quote out of my head. I mean the monsters are literal zombies ‚Äî but is there something in the idea of metaphorical/emotional zombies? Ie: ‚ÄúI suffered this event and I was just a total zombie afterward, I felt totally empty inside.‚Äù

I dunno, this could be another crazy reach. It‚Äôs just been on my mind so I thought I‚Äôd share.",1,1729965751.0,FromTVEpix,2,1.0,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

I'm having trouble cleaning my Oxo 8 cup coffee maker and I'm hoping someone here can help me. 
I got this as a very generous gift from a family member Christmas of 2022. I used to use it daily and kept up on the maintenance of the machine all that time.
I stopped using it about 6 months ago.

2 weeks ago I decided I wanted coffee. I knew I would have to run descaling solution through it. We have very hard water here so this would be a long job.
Anyway, I ran the solution through and after several rinses, I was getting this white 'sand' with little black specks in it. 
My first thought was maybe it was undissolved descaler. 
I did another cleaning cycle with the solution making absolutely positive the powder was thoroughly dissolved before pouring it in the machine. Run cleaning cycle, run multiple rinses and still the white and black specks. 

Last weekend and this morning, I went at with several cleanings (i think 5 altogehter now) with 50/50 water and distilled white vinegar. 
Run cleaning cycles, run multiple rinses and STILL this white and black stuff.

I'd call Oxo, but they are only available Monday through Friday 9-5 which is while I'm at work.
Does anyone have any other suggestions as to what I can do?",1,1729964872.0,Coffee_Machines,0,1.0,False

1gcqmgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EstimateVarious7638/comments/1gcqmgy/exclusion/,Exclusion,"Hi friends! So its 2024 and I'm currently in college, but I'm facing a bit of a dillema. I've developed to be a very outgoing, sweet, kind person. I know how to study and party hard. I always follow through with plans, unless something wrong turns up. I always feel like I am included to things individually, like when one of my friends wants to get coffee with me or go to the dining hall. Well, heres the start of my issues: my two best friends on campus told me that they would hang out with me on my birthday and proceeded to tell me not to make any plans with anyone on that weekend because they had a suprise. I guess the suprise is that they literally did not show up because one of the girls posted that she went out  to a party... off campus, out of state. She didn't even ask the girls she was with (who I was aquanted with and liked me) to see if I would be able to come, and didn't tell me that she wouldn't be on campus. She posted the shit out of this. And she wasn't mad at me or anything, she just straight up did it and didn't apologize to me the next day because she was ""busy studying"".  The other friend that promised me he would hang out with me on my birthday was studying the whole time and didn't offer to hang out with me at all... Again, I wish he would have just texted me to say that he had an exam coming up and he wast sure if he was able to do anything rather than having me wait all day for nothing to happen. I was all alone on my birthday. I could have made plans with other people, but at that point it was too last minute and no one was avalible. This was the most extreme incident that has happened so far, but even after apologizing two days after all of this, the girl friend that I was telling you about decided to make halloween plans without me, which I found out from one of the grils involved in the plan. They always say ""we can't do anything off campus"" to hang out because they are ""busy and have no money"", but then they go out spontaneously and spend money on stupid shit. They only ask me to hang out when it's spontaneous and on a whim. And they've been getting passive aggressive towards me for spending time with other people... saying things like ""oh you're so popular"" or ""oh ofc you can't hang out the one day we're in the dining hall"" or even trying to see if they could invite themselves into my friends house... I've been distancing myself because several other incidents of me feeling excluded by them and feeling like a last minute option have occurred. These are not my only friends of course. I have a crap ton of people I sit down and converse with on a daily bassis that I am begining to hang out with more. However, as much as I can say that I'm realtively popular on campus, I still don't belong anywhere. Some people are so flakey with me. Like we would make plans with each other and then they just completely don't keep me updated after I follow up with them. Or I would make plans a week ahead of time and then  my friend would cancel on me the day of. It feels like I'm not a priority to anyone. I feel so alone honestly. My school is very small and I'm trying to figure out how to be happy on my own as best as possible, but I feel like I am nothing without feeling accepted by people. I'm tired of walking on eggshells and feeling like I have to do ALL of the work for people to hang out with me. Would anyone even notice if I was gone? This has been the story of my life for a matter of years now. I can't believe that when I was a little girl I actually thought I was going to have a prom date, meanwhile I ended up going literally by myself. Idk bro. I feel like I'm not happy when I'm not a part of any meaningful relationships. I really feel just so unhappy, like a loser. I don't know how to fix it other than by going to the gym and being positive towards people and trying to build up my confidence, but I don't know how to even be confident. Anyways, thanks for listening because this issue has been weighing down for me for so long and I would really appreciate advice.",1,1729964766.0,u_EstimateVarious7638,0,1.0,False

Last night was the third day in a row this lady was staying with her two kids, except this time only the older remained and there was a different lady. Those were caregivers and the children were in the foster system. Earlier yesterday, the youngest one had been taken to a family member, but the older brother I guess was from a different dad so they wouldn't take him. So my local CPS arranged to take him to an institute 4 hours from our hometown.

Our local institute is closing down due to many reports of abuse and neglect, and these kids were there and got out. The older kid remaining (12 yo) wanted to take the roll of toilet paper because he was scared he wouldn't even have that in the new place. The lady taking care of him told me she was sorry because she'd been in the system her whole life too, and she knew everyone had to fend for themselves and would end up running away and living in the streets, like she had. She said she was moved so many times for abuse, overcrowding or running away that she knows most of our country. 

I suppressed the tears and sneaked the child some of the complimentary soap and shampoo packets we leave in the room for guests. I had to hide it because there are cameras and the owner is the kind of man that thinks he'll take his money with him once he dies. I've gotten in trouble for using the coffee machine that's in the kitchen for employees only, so imagine what he's like. 

Then the crackhead that lives at the hotel heard about the kid and ran out to get him stuff like deodorant, conditioner and some candy. He told me he'd just finished a sale, so he wanted the money to go to a good cause. I almost broke down crying, because the owner of the hotel and his son make fun of him and treat him badly, but he's actually decent and caring. 

Later that evening, a man and a social worker came and took him to the new institute, with the lady who was going to accompany him and drop him off. He looked so scared and I felt so broken because I know the system, and it has to have been so fucking bad for him to be taken away from home to an institute, and then have that place \*close down\* due to negligence and abuse and be taken away of all you know to a new start. We live in a small town in which troubled kids are moderately safe on the streets (it takes a village and all that) and we have many projects in place such as tutoring, sports clubs, all-day school with free lunch and afternoon snacks, etc., but it's gonna be different in a big city. Today I feel so alone against the whole world. I just couldn't hold it in anymore and I don't wanna depress any friends or family.",10,1729964734.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

My grinder keeps on getting stuck?? It will start to make a very loud clunking noise and won't grind. The only solution is to hoover out the remaining beans, dislodge the bean that got stuck and start again.

This has happened multiple times on various grind sizes. I've changed the internal burr back to the default size of 6 as I had previously turned it down due to fast running espresso. 

Since I've had the machine, I've not been able to get a shot run at a normal speed so I have been adjusting the grind size finer (and worked on distribution/tamping) to no avail and now I've started having this issue too. 

I'm using some old beans whilst I test out the machine - could old beans REALLY be causing me this much issue???? As additional info they are lightly roaster.

 I used to be a barista so have only ever really worked with fresh on commercial machines and this is more of a learning curve than I expected. 

Edit: When this happens and I look inside the burrs, the coffee beans look like they've just sort of been chopped/crunched rather than ground. ",1,1729964498.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

They say ADHD disappears after you reach the age of maturity (it is 18 here)ü§¶ But it is a story for another post. 

Anyways, after I've done some research, I've found a couple of options. I have a lot of trials and now am 2 weeks in my final option which is atomoxetine 60mg, selegiline 15mg and 2mg guanfacine. This seems to be the best one yet. However there are 3 unpleasant side effects am experiencing, but we'll return to that in a minute. I am mostly inattentive with a sprinkle of hyperactivity. My major issue is loss motivation, inability to focus and procrastination. I'm sure many of you can relate to that.

So in my current meds combo atomoxetine helps me to concentrate, guanfacine improves my executive function and selegiline gives me energy and motivation. Before that i could only do about 1.5 - 2 hours of work a day. Now i can work for 6-10 hours a day and i go on breaks not because I'm tired of making myself concentrate but because i have actually done some good amount of work. 

I also struggle with anxiety and atomoxetine suppresses it. Also i feel a bit sleepy and selegiline helps me. Now i need less hours of sleep to feel energised. But atomoxetine and selegiline combined give a side effect of being antsy (like you've had too much coffee) and here's when guanfacine steps up. And meds reinforce eachother too. 

Side effects:

- Loss of sleep quality. Trazodone helps me a lot. Other meds made me a zombie in the morning. 

- It almost kills my libido. But it's pretty common for any type of ADHD medications as i know.

- They taste awful so if i take my meds without food it'll make me sick ü§¢vot

Much like some struggle with the idea of hypothetical questions","So up front. I'm an atheist. I was happily part of the shit-lord era of Atheism before the woke side tried to take over and destroyed most of what was built there because everything has to be about everything else progressive and have to campaign for it all at once all the time or some such BS. 

Why say this? Well the original title of this threat was ""Is it weird to anyone else with the whole Castlevania Vampires hates crosses because 90 degree angles that the woke side struggles to accept the concept of God in fictional universes?"".

I mean it is weird right? I don't have to believe in a God existing to accept in fiction the concept of the power of God being real as a thing. 

I then started thinking of all the woke side's stuff about how fiction needs to represent people and the push for ""realistic looking female characters"" even though based on my work colleagues most of the modern ""realistic"" female characters are uglier than them. I also started thinking about how people have kept pointing out how people were saying diversity wise it seemed like the woke side were pushing for everything to look like Portland / The Burger King Kids club / the fictional idea of diversity these activists pretend California is like as they live in their mostly gated mostly all white private communities.  

Fiction isn't real life so why does this stuff matter? Well activists struggle with fiction. It makes so much sense. Why are they weirded out or on about getting the Ick over stuff? They struggle to accept it and engage with it and it weirds them out so they want it to look like the reality or close enough to it that they know. They can accept some fictional elements, Vampires, aliens or stuff in the popular culture but anything they don't understand they struggle with. History having less diversity? Can't be true they only know POChistory Tumblr not actual history and even then they struggle with the idea of history because it's not like they know, it's different and the idea of something different to their current life is something they struggle to understand. 

It's why so many series and IP are suddenly having Proms or coffee shop springing up like somehow in D&D it's what the woke side understand or know. 

It's why there's such a flare up with SJWs in Warhammer 40K regularly. Firstly you have to buy into the fiction that the Imperium while it would be awful to live in by our standards is the best of a bad universe. It has an entity with God like power. It has actual evil Gods. It's why the Woke side insisted on keeping putting out PSAs about Helldivers 2 and Space Marine 2, they struggle with the idea people can engage with these fictional worlds without agreeing with them.",25,1729964012.0,KotakuInAction,7,0.93,False

In the 8 years we have been together, my husband‚Äôs sil has been a constant pain inn my ass. Ok here is a little back story. So my husband was set up on a blind date in high school with future sil. She brought a friend with her to the date. And my husband upon seeing both girls chose sil friend, who he dated for a few months. This really pissed sil off, of course. So sil and husband went on with life until 12 years ago when sil made it a point to find and start dating my husbands brother. My husband told his brother not to date her that she was absolutely crazy and a code red stalker. His brother didn‚Äôt listen and within a month or 2 of dating sil was pregnant (on purpose on her end). So my husband‚Äôs brother then married her, in secret from all of my husbands family. She then showed up at my husbands family house and shoved the marriage certificate in mil face saying we are married and yall are stuck with me now. And from that day on sil has made life hell for anyone my husband had dated. Now to 8 years ago, from the first day she met me she made sideways comments about how my husband was narcissistic, abusive, egotistical and a man whore. I ignored all of this because I was raised to never listen to hearsay and to form my own opinion. That is when she started the competition between her and I. That I was not even aware I was in. If my husband (bf at the time)  did or bought me anything she had to have exactly the same or better from husbands brother. I bought yellow rose bushes for mine and husband‚Äôs house in remembrance of my late father (they were his favorite flower). So she threw an absolute fit and demanded that husband‚Äôs brother go buy her yellow rose bushes and plant them at their place. My husband screened in our porch, she demanded the same, and ect. This never registered in my head as a problem because as I said I didn‚Äôt know we were in competition. Until the day that my husbands mothers best friend stayed the night at our house one night due to being to tired to drive to her home. The next morning my husband went to work, and when I woke up I went to greet our guest, and offer coffee. Only this never happened as I was verbally assaulted the minute I walked into the living room, accused of being the one who was making sil life hell by constantly demanding my husband give me everything she wanted. The look on my face was a mixture of shock, confusion, and then full on redheaded rage! And I instantly fired back with ‚Äúare you completely crayon eating stupid? None of what you just said makes sense nor is any of that true!‚Äù And that why would I want anything she had when she has absolutely nothing I want. She ignored everything I said and went from accusing to threatening me and my relationship with my husband saying she could make it to where my husband left me without question. I had enough at that time grabbed my phone and keys and just walked out my house, I text my husband told him what all had happened and been said and told him i would not be going back to the house until she was gone. He said ok baby go get your nails done, get some coffee and he would take care of it. A half hour later he said I could go home and that she had called him crying saying I was rude, disrespectful and forced her to leave then had left myself and had left his front door wide open. ( I would never of done this as we have a cat who I do not let outside). And to my absolute shock my husband was mad at me for all this. I let it go, and distanced myself from his family unless it was a holiday or birthday, and was all but forced to go. Because sil had gotten worse (didn‚Äôt even knew that was possible), she started including my kids into her sideway comments and more than a few times actually came out and said in front of myself, my husband, his brother, mom and dad that I had the husband she wanted and house she deserved. My husband turned 5 shades of green threw up and demanded that we leave that instant. Now here we are 4 days away from our annual Halloween party, (yes the brother and sil were invited in the past) this year because of issues related to sil being there in past years my husband and I decided not to invite her or his brother. Talking to my mil a few days ago and she said how she had asked brother and sil if they were coming to the party? I said why would you do that, she looked confused so I went on to say why would you ask if they were coming to the arrays they were NOT invited. She then went on this whole lecture about how I couldn‚Äôt do that, they were family and how I was harboring animosity towards sil for no reason just to cause issues. And for the first time in 8 yrs I lost it with mil. And said idk what fantasy world she was living in but that her ass need professional help for it. And that on the subject of sil, my husband and I were in 100% agreement on this and it would not nor will not ever change. She is not invited nor is she welcome at our house, near our kids, and ect. She then said I was being a bitch and her son would never say that. And I could either climb off my high horse and invite her or mil and fil would not be attending either. I said ok there is the door GTFO! She was already calling my husband on her way out and by the time she reached her car she was crying and yelling at my husband for allowing such a woman as I am to control his life and to destroy his relationship with his family. Then she said ‚Äú there is no way her p***y could be that great!‚Äù All she heard was me bust out in laughter saying ‚Äúit sure the hell is, by now drive safe!‚Äù So AITA for not inviting sil to Halloween party and for having life changing and controlling bomb ass p***y lol.

i find myself again perusing reddit after some tokes and a dunkin trip, and i am excited to share the happy news! 

they did it. without fail or hesitation - dunkin followed through with their sprinkled promise. in my last post, i had received 3/10 sprinkled munchkins with the majority being regular assorted donuts.

but this time. not this time, my dunkin, oh my dunkin came through. i didn‚Äôt move anything before taking the photo - that is exactly how i was blessed.

not only did it hit the nail on the head for my donut order, but my coffee, on this fine saturday morning? Divine. the typical go-to order for me is a large cold brew with light ice, caramel flavoring, almondmilk & a shot of espresso. i have had many variations of this drink. but today, along with the sprinkled donuts, i found delicious coffee and unwavering peace at dunkin donuts.

i hope the same peace travels through the water lines of every dunkin‚Äô donuts in the world and finds you.

sometimes it‚Äôs the little things, lol :) have a great day friends!

1gcq5bd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1gcq5bd/hauntingcleansing_advice_please/,Haunting/Cleansing advice please üòÖ ,"Hello, I just wanted some advice or thoughts from the community before I move forward in this situation. 

TL;DR, my partner and I have had enough experiences to say that we feel like we have something unfriendly in our home. We‚Äôve had nightmares, intense feelings of a presence, unexplainable footsteps, and even potentially objects moving. I kind of want to cleanse with either Palo Santo or Sage, but I‚Äôm not sure exactly how I want to go about it, because it feels like things got worse after the very last cleansing we did.

For more backstory, we‚Äôd had uneasy feelings in the home when we moved in.  I got the sensation of someone being abused in the home BEFORE I saw that there were patched holes in the walls and a couple doors, especially at the end of the hall. Kind of a feeling of being watched from that area. I did a simple cleansing and claiming of the space as ours and things calmed down and were calmer and less creepy for years.

This year we had a roommate move in and out, hence the last cleansing of the space. She rented the room at the end of the hall, and used the bathroom at the end of the hall. It wasn‚Äôt like she had bad energy, my partner and I just felt the need to cleanse after she had left. We went room to room, smoke cleansing with a lavender incense, starting in our upstairs bedroom and working outward. We did the main bedroom at the end of the hall, and it was all calm. We did the other room, calm. As we approached the bathroom at the end of the hall, I was struck with a feeling that I rarely get anymore as an adult. It was overwhelming fear and repulsion, like my body wanted to leave but was frozen at the same time, like I shouldn‚Äôt speak. I pushed through anyways. We smudged and I said my little cleansing phrase, the feeling went away and we moved on. I didn‚Äôt say anything to my partner because I didn‚Äôt want to scare her or influence her feelings.

After we finished the cleansing we sat down and I asked her if she felt anything when we did our walk. ‚ÄúActually‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ it felt like something went right through me in the bathroom‚Ä¶‚Äù I told her what I‚Äôd felt there too. She said she had a random, vivid, and horrid mental image of a bloody dead body in the bathtub. She doesn‚Äôt usually talk like that and it gave me chills.

In the following week, we heard more footsteps than ever, I heard doors open, saw a door open twice in a row that I swear shouldn‚Äôt have been able to simply swing open the second time, some objects fell (far, as if thrown) that honestly shouldn‚Äôt have fallen, and we had intense nightmares and dreams. Feelings of being watched and disliked.

One of these nights of bad dreams, I woke up, and my wife woke up immediately after. She told me she was having a scary dream, through hazy recollection, that this ghost was telling her she had no idea how powerful it was. I felt like I‚Äôd heard movement in the house before we went to sleep, so I cast corners, sprayed the room with frankincense and went through some protective exercises with her (surrounded by a bright white light kinda thing). 

Here‚Äôs where it gets weird. As I was falling asleep right after this, I realized I was outside of the bed standing in the room- and as soon as I was like ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt I in bed‚Ä¶?‚Äù I would wake up. This happened several times where I felt like I was in the house, so eventually I decided to explore, knowing it was a lucid dream. I felt like I was sensing a dark presence so I followed it, same feeling as in the bathroom. I invoked the elemental guardians in my dream and the intensity of the dark feeling (overwhelming, couldn‚Äôt move or speak) eased. Eventually in the dream I came through a door in the back of my house which led to a coffee shop. The barista was a woman about my age, and she said ‚ÄúOh, hi! I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre here, we were just talking about you!‚Äù I felt like she was supernatural and extremely protective somehow. We talked for a minute before I asked her about the situation with the weird presence. She told me verbatim, ‚ÄúI am haunted by Loo-see-us.‚Äù I spelled it like that because I had a very distinct feeling of the letter ‚ÄúE‚Äù being in the name, but she said it like ‚ÄúLucious,‚Äù but I almost felt like it was ‚ÄúLuceus.‚Äù She phrased it like SHE was the one haunted by ‚ÄúLuceus.‚Äù After that, I felt like I was being pulled backwards through a tunnel and woke up in my bed. I really paraphrased the dream and can go into greater detail in comments if you‚Äôd like. 

Also our roommate was a witch too- I bring it up because I know she had a deck called ‚Äúthe sinners tarot‚Äù which came with a warning not to use it lightly, as it‚Äôs a deck designed to invoke certain entities. I don‚Äôt know what all she was into and again I don‚Äôt think she was into anything bad, especially on purpose, but it does stick out to me.

We‚Äôve been doing more grounding and protective things since that night and things have been calmer since honestly. We decided to do a bigger more thorough cleanse on the next waning moon, which we‚Äôre past the last quarter but still haven‚Äôt done the cleanse, hesitating for some reason, so idk I just wanted to ask for advice. Idk tbh i‚Äôm leaving out a lot of stuff for the sake of streamlining but if you have any EDUCATED and CONFIDENT suggestions for how to handle this please let me know‚Ä¶",2,1729963442.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

I'm not American. I'm Eastern European and he wanted to talk about my foreign practices. It had the tone of an honest heart to heart about his feelings, but the contents were not something I would normally expect. Not going to lie, as a European I found it bizarre.

He has an important repair task he has been postponing since July. We agreed he'd do it today. He said he needs me to enable him and not interrupt him. So I haven't been bothering him since last evening. Night was so rough with  the baby I didn't get a chance to pee at all. Passed out with a completely fully bladder. Didn't bother him. 

He got up, had coffee, scrolled, pooped etc for an hour. I asked if he feels well rested and is ok to repair stuff. He snapped and said he only got coffee and pooped, he didn't rest or had the chance to have a nutritious breakfast. So I said okay I have the baby go ahead and have breakfast. I didn't eat, pee or brush my teeth yet at that point. Then he said, I don't allow him to spend quality time with his own daughter and he's standing up for himself for once (he says this about twice every day). I said okay watch her I'll have coffee then.

After half hour of playing the baby started getting hungry and peed. So he said he's been doing all the child care for an hour and a half so it's time for me to take over.

And then he sat me down again for a serious talk about his feelings. How it affects his mental health when I'm complaining about him always being on his phone. How all his friends are watching football and talking about it and he is missing out on all of this. But like, I literally give him 2 full games on the weekends. Just not all day. This is not normal right? He's saying it's because of my foreign practices and we should let the baby cry it out and sleep train her so we could enjoy football like all his friends.

How much uninterrupted football watching is done in your house? I'm ok to adapt to local culture but tbh not entirely if it really is the case that the men watch football all weekend.

So because my car is broke down-I am at his mercy.  I needed a ride today to go to a free clothing give away.  Yes, as  embarrassing as that is to admit.  I have really fallen on hard times as so many people have.  So because winter is almost here and I don't have any snow boots I wanted to go.  
Of course last night he was going to take me and even set his alarm.  Lol.  What a joke.  
So when his alarm went off and he didn't get up I just figured that we wouldn't be going and I got up and started coffee. As I sat down with my first cup of coffee, enjoying the the quiet, and definitely not thinking about anything negative.  I was simply sitting with my coffee and the quiet.  
When all of the sudden he yells ""Fucking Bullshit"" it startled me.  I said "" what's wrong?"" And he says in a loudish rude tone ""why aren't we going to the thing? I thought to myself "" here we fucking go with this bullshit!"" He wanted a reaction.  He wanted me to be pissed so he could turn it all around and then it would be because of me as to why we didn't go.  Instead of falling for his bullshit I said "" I'm ready to go whenever you are."" And he starts in ""well why didn't you wake me up?"" Now he is talking to me in a pissed off tone as if I have done something wrong to him.  It is so hard to hold it together and not just scream Fuck You! But I don't do that because that just plays into his bullshit.  So I told him that I hadn't woke him up because I just got up and I was making the coffee first.  I shit you not--he comes flying out of the bedroom screaming and cussing at me.  ""Oh you are having a fucking pity party"" and says "" yeah now its all my fault we didn't go right?"" I say to him "" what are you talking about? I'm ready to go, let's go.""
Anyways this is so fucking classic of a narc.  And I sit here 3 hours later just disgusted with myself and my life again.  Its pathetic.

I am thankful that I see through the bullshit now, I know the game, and I'm not falling for the tactics as I have before.

1gcq0ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/chronicfatigue/comments/1gcq0ve/cant_figure_out_what_pems_is/,Can't figure out what PEMS is?,"Sorry for the long post here....I've got a long, long, long history of fatigue and pain. I'd say it's gotten worse in the last several years, but it's so hard to tell because my mental health has been steadily declining. I was diagnosed with GAD as a child, PTSD at 16, and have a lifetime of traumatic events with little to no breaks in between them. I was diagnosed with EDS a few years ago based on lax joints and easy to bruise skin, a transiently positive ANA (highest being 1:160), and IBS definitively last month (ruled out Crohn's etc with a colonoscopy, but I've had IBS symptoms since childhood). Fibro has been mentioned because every single ""tender point"" is active for me, but it's unclear if that's secondary to the EDS. I also have a seronegative unspecified autoimmune disorder - the fatigue responded AMAZINGLY to Plaquenil for about 2 months, but I've leveled out now. I also periodically test positive for Babesia, having been diagnosed with it in 2010 but my titer will intermittently spike.

I had what I'd call a mental breakdown in September. Couldn't stop crying, having panic attacks, and generally not able to function. Constant feelings of crushing doom. I struggled to eat and lost 8 pounds. It was so bad, I developed uncomplicated shingles (took the antivirals, cleared up in 7-10 days, no worsening of any conditions aside from a little residual neuralgia that has subsided). Since the breakdown started, my anxiety has been LASER focused on what could be physically wrong with me, rather than that the worsening of symptoms is likely a physical manifestation of my anxiety. My fear before this was Crohn's disease, and I even had a colonoscopy done to rule that out - that's how intense this anxiety has been. CFS has been particularly hard because I can't definitively rule it in, or out, and there is no treatment. My mental health started to slide after I finally left an abusive relationship in December after 7+ years, then did a round of EMDR to attempt to address trauma. I went into several days of severe pain and horrific anxiety following the EMDR. As a whole, intense episodes of emotion (which I have many!) don't tend to affect me beyond leaving me emotionally drained.

I have fatigue almost all the time. I'd describe it as really tired/heavy eyes, but I don't feel tired enough to nap most of the time. I have a difficult time getting up to do things but honestly can't tell if it's a physical or mental difficulty, or both. I know that I used to be very motivated to do things like keep the apartment clean, but have been finding it is less and less important/appealing to me in the past several months. Most notably is that I feel hopeless, like there is no point to anything, and like I am fighting a losing battle and will suffer for the rest of my life.

My body feels like a toddler having a temper tantrum - it doesn't \*want\* to do things. It wants to just rot. I can get up, and I can go to the store, or get coffee, or do something I'm looking forward to (like a trivia night, or go to a concert) and I haven't noticed that any of these things drastically worsen my symptoms, but getting to do those things is like pulling my body while it's kicking and screaming, until I actually get out to do the thing. I have had times where I will feel flu-y for a few days, but I have never been able to tie it to any kind of cycle or specific activity and it is not frequent. My rheumatologist has attributed this to vague ""flares"" of my autoimmune issue; I would imagine the average person also gets these episodes sporadically when they are fighting something off or were exposed to an illness, and I don't feel like it's super frequent. I don't get fevers or swollen lymph nodes and I don't notice that my cognitive state or orthostatic state worsen. I am able to sit up for very extended periods of time without issue. Standing for long periods of time makes me woozy (but, this will sound dumb - as a kid I locked my knees during a concert, and now when I think about standing for long periods of time, I get dizzy). I would identify my flares as an increase in muscular pain/muscular fatigability, often noticeable enough that I am limping or the muscle/joint is throbbing, and a drop in energy levels. I don't feel the pain in every part of my body - for example, I worked a shift as an EMT last night and had a 3am call. I jumped up quickly, heart racing from the startle, and this morning have felt quite tired, with markedly painful calves and a tight lower back. The rest of me feels okay enough right now, except for my mental state, which is feeling like that scene in Inside Out 2 where the anxiety is in a whirlwind....y'know.

I have very low physical endurance, but this has been a theme for me since childhood. I hit my target HR (or beyond!) very quickly with exertion, but my HR also recovers normally. I am also 10000% deconditioned at this point, as I have been not wanting to get out and do things for the last few months. There have been times that I feel so tired, I could doze off where I am (especially if I am under stimulated, like sitting and waiting for the doctor or sitting at my desk in the office in silence). Outside of this, I have muscle pain (primarily in my neck and shoulders as well as my lower back), joint pain that is transient (knees and wrists mostly, but I have defects in these joints visible on MRI), constant brain fog (what I would describe as static - it feels like there is SO MUCH going on in my brain that I physically can't focus). Sometimes I get dizzy if I stand up too quickly, but there is no marked change in my BP or pulse. My sleep is almost always unrefreshing.

I understand PEM is the ""golden rule"" to diagnosing CFS. I can't tell if what I'm describing is PEM, or worsening of condition based on my chronic health problems. I can most definitely tell in my muscles if I pushed it too much - because I am so sedentary, if I do something physically demanding like a deep clean of the apartment, I will feel extra tired afterwards and have delayed muscle soreness \~1-2 days later, which resolves over time. Repetitive motion is my enemy - if I have to keep squatting, keep lifting my arms, keep doing the same movement over and over, that is bound to make my muscles hurt. The increase in tiredness does not tend to linger more than \~24 hours and I return to my normal, ""status quo"" tired state. I am SO anxious about this now that I can't even convince myself to do activity, because I'm afraid I'll get PEMS, end up fully disabled, causing permanent damage, etc. I know activity in general can flare up EDS, fibro, autoimmune issues - all of it. How do you know if it's a flare or PEM?

All testing so far has been normal, with the exception of: SVT, transient nocturnal AV block, PVCs/PACs, and mitral valve prolapse; subluxated patellas secondary to patellofemoral maltracking; a sudden but stable abnormality on brain MRI on my thalamus; and I score very high on the GAD and PTSD questionnaires, to this day. I had a sleep study and am awaiting those results.

I can't really TLDR this post, so I really appreciate anyone who stuck it out. I guess I wonder what anyone thinks. I see a therapist weekly and I am working with a psychiatrist, both of which said that physical manifestations of severe anxiety are extremely common. I am essentially focusing on what could physically be causing me issues, rather than learning to address the psychological stuff. I literally cannot stop googling, reading Reddit posts, etc. and I am sure I am going to start creating psychosomatic PEM if I don't have it already. I have read the criteria 8000 times now and it just still feels so VAGUE. I can still convince myself that I definitely have it. But it seems like on the other hand, it's not a ""do I have it?"" so much as a ""you KNOW if you have it"" kind of thing. SOS?",1,1729963104.0,chronicfatigue,0,1.0,False

I had to stay late for a party at the office to spend time with people I didn't like and hardly knew yet. And, as I finally found the moment to say my goodbyes and left the building, I was smacked in the face by rain carried over on a harsh howling wind.¬†

Cursing myself for forgetting an umbrella, I jumped out and looked for the next subway station. I was still quite new to this town and had to find my way around. My glasses were just as wet as my phone, which didn't help much to find the right direction.¬†

The surrounding lights of the shops and bars shone in the puddles on the ground. I tried my best to avoid them but failed twice and my sneakers were soaked and muddy.¬† My grumbling stomach didn't help with the very bad mood I already had. I had filled up on more liquid than food at the party, hoping it would push me to socialize a little. It didn't.

As I was just about to lose my nerves and call a cab, I saw it. The place that would become my sanctuary and my hell.¬†

*Franky's*¬†

The building itself was nothing special or at least nothing memorable. Yellow bricks or possibly grey concrete with windows on the higher floors. The ground floor however only had this big door with a wooden sign on top. Franky's: Restaurant & Bar was written in golden cursive letters that were lit up with a single light bulb on top of it.¬†

I can't tell you what led me to open the door, let alone walk inside but before I knew what I was doing I found myself in a small entrance hall.¬†

A hostess stood behind a wooden desk and when her gaze dropped to my soaked clothes she gave me a warm smile. She was dressed in an elegant black sweater and a skirt.¬†

""Table for one?"" She asked.¬†

""Oh, no, sorry,"" I started mumbling. ""I came in by accident.""

She slowly shook her head.

""You walked into a restaurant by accident?""

And just as I looked for words to fill the silence my stomach took initiative and let out a loud grumble.¬†

""I suppose your tummy doesn't think it was an accident,"" she giggled. ""But you're in luck. We still have an empty table. It's just down the stairs."" She gestured to her right where a small hallway led to a spiralling staircase.¬†

I was just about to turn around and get away, politeness be damned because I did not see myself sitting in a restaurant completely soaked, especially as I didn't even know how expensive this place might be. But then the scent of roasted garlic and baked bread filled my nose and before I could stop myself I was moving towards the stairs.

""Enjoy!"" The woman called after me.¬†

I'd never been to a restaurant in a basement before and this place almost felt like a cave with its uneven stone walls. It should have felt suffocating but instead, it was cozy and inviting. It was dim, most of the light came from individual candles on the tables and soft piano music was being played by a man in the center of the room. The walls were adorned with dozens of paintings.¬†

A waiter dressed in a white shirt led me to my table. But as I sat down the eyes of every person around turned to me. Everyone stopped talking, the soft tune of the piano the only sound. I caught the eyes of a woman at the table to my left and she simply stared at me, not blinking once. Her mouth opened and for a moment I thought she would say something to me but instead her mouth only opened wider to reveal a set of rotten teeth.¬†

I blinked and she tilted her head, giving me a smile with full red lips and no sign of rot.

That's when the waiter placed a basket of bread in front of me and the gazes of the people shifted again as the muffled conversations continued. It was nothing, just a trick of the light mixed with my muddled mind.

""Thank you,"" I said to the man who filled my glass and he nodded as he handed me a card.

""I will be back in a moment to take your order,"" he said before heading to a different table.¬†

Surprisingly, the meals were very affordable and everything sounded incredibly delicious. I ordered the honey-roasted salmon with rosemary potatoes and a house salad. After placing my order I simply sat there, mesmerized by the light of the warm candle in front of me.¬†

Strangely, for the first time since I'd moved here, I felt at home. Like I belonged. I forgot about the cold waiting for me outside, forgot about my wet clothes, and the terrible conversations I had with my colleagues.¬†

I was pulled away from my thoughts as the waiter placed my meal in front of me. The mouth-watering scents filled my nose and I started digging in. Every bite tasted better than the one before and I used the bread to soak up the last bits of sauce and oil on my plate.¬†

The waiter appeared again and I ordered a chocolate lava cake for dessert.¬†

I'm not sure how much time had passed at that point and I realized that I didn't care. I would have stayed there forever if I could, falling asleep with the sound of the piano.¬†

My cake was brought out with a shot of espresso I hadn't ordered. I finished my dessert and drank the coffee in one gulp. And that's when my heart started racing. The walls felt as if they were about to cave in, no matter how hard I tried my lungs wouldn't fill with enough air.¬†

A look at my watch made me realize that five hours had passed. There was no way I had been eating for five fucking hours. I looked at the burning candle that hadn't shrunk one bit. I even touched it to make sure that it was real and burned my finger in the process.¬†

I quickly placed some notes on the table and practically ran up the stairs without looking at another person.¬†

\--

The following morning I still had no idea what had happened to me but it took me hours until I was even remotely ready to get out of bed. The days after weren't much better. I felt constantly tired, agitated, and exhausted. 

But that wasn't the worst of it.¬†

I couldn't eat anymore. I'd try a piece of bread and would instantly taste mold on it and spit it out. Even my favorite meals tasted like ash in my mouth. Eventually, I had to resort to blending my food and physically force myself to swallow it. But even then I would throw it back up most of the time.¬†

A week later I was just on my way back from the gym near my home, hoping to get some energy back, when I suddenly noticed the same sign at the front of a building, in a completely different part of town.

Franky's

Curiosity got the best of me and I opened the door, just to be greeted by the exact same hostess of the other night.¬†

""Table for one?"" She asked with a smirk and before I knew what I was doing, I nodded and made my way down the stairs.¬†

\--

I'd just started with my dinner when another guest came up to my table.¬†

""You're a regular now, aren't you?""¬†

He couldn't have been much older than me, late twenties or maybe early thirties but his curly blonde hair and the freckles on his face gave him a slightly boyish look.¬†

""Excuse me?"" I laughed nervously.

He didn't even ask permission before sitting down in the seat in front of me which usually stayed empty.

""A regular visitor of the restaurant. Though everyone here is,"" he winked. ""What's your name?""

""Leonard Erikson.""

""Leonard Erikson."" He repeated my name as if he was tasting every single syllable. ""It is truly a pleasure to meet you.""

I smiled and when he stayed silent for a while I asked, ""Are you gonna tell me your name too?""

He grinned.

""Not today, Leo. Can I call you Leo?""

I rolled my eyes and laughed.

""Are you serious?""¬†

""Wellm how about you call me Jack. It's not my name but I'll answer to it,"" he shrugged. ""You know you seem really at ease for someone who is being lured into this place. A lot of people lose their calm much sooner.""

A hard lump formed in my throat and it felt as if someone had poured ice water over my head. It *was* weird that I came back here, especially as I was in a completely different part of town. But I just felt so incredibly hungry.¬†

""Shht, it's okay. You haven't even finished your meal yet. It is easier if you simply ignore the wrongness, at least that's what I learned. I didn't mean to pull you out.""

""Out of what?"" I whispered.

""The experience,"" he said with a sympathetic smile on his face. ""You'll spend a lot of time here, Leo. So just so you know you can interact with the people here. It might even help you to do so. Just be careful what you reveal about yourself.""¬†

""What do you mean?""

""I mean that some of the other guests here are very hungry. They are keeping away from you as you are still fresh but that will change soon. Some hardly ever leave this place and long for a touch of the outside. Don't feed them too much.""

""This is a restaurant. I'm sure they won't go hungry here.""

""Not every type of hunger can be stilled with food, Leo.""

Before I could reply, he got off his seat but I grabbed his arm on instinct. I still had so many questions and I wanted to hear him speak for longer. I wanted to know more about him but before I could do so, Jack's expression shifted into the one of a madman. He yanked his arm free, shoving his fists down on the table in front of me. He came close enough for me to feel the heat of his breath on my skin. In the dim light, his eyes appeared almost yellow as they were drilling into mine.¬†

""Don't ever touch me again,"" he hissed and turned away from me. This time I didn't try to stop him.

I ate the rest of my meal in silence and didn't look for Jack, nor did I interact with anyone else. But I could swear that the eyes of every guest around me were glued to me the entire evening.

\--

""Welcome, Leonard. Table for one? Or would you like me to match you up with someone?"" The friendly hostess greeted me the next time I found the restaurant somewhere it shouldn't and couldn't be. It'd been weeks and I couldn't let go of Franky's. My moments of clarity were few and far between at this point. I'd lost a lot of weight, I stopped going to work, bills were piling up but I couldn't make myself care.¬†

""Why do I keep coming back?"" I asked because she seemed to be one of the few slightly trustworthy ones.

""I stopped asking myself that decades ago,"" she sighed.

""Why can't I eat anything else anymore?""¬†

""Because all our ingredients are imported from a very special place. A very special town,"" she gave me that warm smile that always made me feel welcome.

""That must be the most wonderful town in the world.""

She nodded.¬†

\--

Franky's became my dirty little secret. I couldn't meet friends over dinner or coffee anymore because I couldn't consume anything from the outside. Nobody would have believed my story anyway and if I was completely honest I didn't want to share it. Franky's was *mine*. I knew that for a fact because now it appeared to me almost daily. Always at different places and usually when I needed it the most. Sometimes I wandered around town for hours just so I could find it. On days that I didn't, I wanted to gouge my own eyes out.

I also started understanding what Jack was trying to tell me. Talking to other guests was, well, a very interesting form of torture and control. I had a conversation with an old lady, her hair was spotty and grey, her face was full of wrinkles. She reminded me of my grandmother but without the kindness. A few times I would catch glimpses of rot in her. For example, there were holes all over her arm which I tried not to focus on even though they made my own skin itch. I told her some stories about my youth, how I was an only child and always had a love for comic books. I tried to stay vague because I knew she was stealing from me but I'd become lonely, starving for conversations that I couldn't have anymore on the outside because people started looking at me strangely.

""I've been coming here for years,"" she said and a tooth fell right out of her mouth into the glass of wine in front of her. I swallowed thickly but didn't comment on it.¬†

""Do you remember much about your past?"" I asked and her expression turned dark.¬†

She shook her head and asked more questions about myself. At the end of our conversation, I was looking at a beautiful woman who couldn't have been older than thirty, showing me a bright, white smile.

I knew at that moment that she'd been stealing from me because the memories of my childhood slowly started disappearing. It hadn't been my intention to share so much but somehow I'd forgotten all about Jack's warning over the delicious ratatouille I'd been enjoying.¬†

She got ready to get up but I grabbed her arm and pulled her closer to my face.

""Give them back,"" I hissed.

Her eyes turned entirely white and she bared her teeth.

""No, it's your own fault you're so dumb.""¬†

I got up from my seat and took her face into my hands, digging in my nails until I drew blood. I knew I wasn't myself at that moment because I pulled my hands back and started tasting the blood on them. Her expression shifted and she quickly hurried away but I knew it had worked because some of my memories came back to me.¬†

I sat back down with a happy grin and got ready to order my dessert when I noticed a familiar face opposite of me. I didn't even see him approaching.

""Hi Leo,"" he grinned.

""Hello, *Jack*.""¬†¬†

""How have you been?""

""Terrible and also fantastic,"" I answered truthfully.

He nodded like he understood exactly what I meant.

""You do look kind of terrible if I'm honest. I'm sorry this happened to you.""

I wasn't sure what he meant. I wasn't sorry. I needed Franky's more than I needed to breathe. It filled a gap I didn't even realize I had before finding it.

""You know, I've been watching you,"" he continued. ""You hardly fed on anyone and that made me sad. I feel a connection to you, did it the first time we met. And I hoped you wouldn't wither away so soon. But it looks like you're finally starting to fight back.""

His praise filled me with a warm feeling and I knew I wanted more of it but I wasn't sure what to say so I stayed silent.

""You know that you can never stop coming here, right?""

""I don't want to stop,"" I said truthfully even though something inside of me screamed that that wasn't right. But if I did stop, I would starve to death and I'd already lost too much of myself.

""Good. Because I have a proposition for you. I need someone to visit the town where we get our supplies and most people here have already lost too much of themselves to leave for a longer time. Would you be willing to make the trip? Don't worry, when you get back the most magnificent meal will be waiting for you.""

I thought about it for a moment. Leaving town would mean leaving Franky's. And whatever that place was it couldn't be good. But I had a feeling that declining wasn't an option.

""Where would that be?"" I asked carefully.

He gave me a smile that didn't reach his eyes.¬†

Before starting to work here, this woman had already gained a reputation for being quite rude to workers, And I can confirm, she is quite rude. 

We may be in high season with many customers queued up waiting for their drink, She will complain and will call you slow. We can have a seasonal limited time drink, she'll order it 6 months later the season is over and complain anyway.

They are really not very loved by my coworkers, But our manager insists that we should be nice and serve them.

Last week, during one of their visits to our store they arrived pretty close to our closing time. They ordered something, sat down and left after a while as usual, but this time there were no complaints.We started cleaning to close but the detail is that they had left one of their phones on the table where they had had their drinks, I remembered seeing the daughter come out with her phone in her hand so I assumed it was her mother's.

There was no one in the parking lot at that time, so I went to tell my coworkers. Them were laughing saying that we shouldn't return it and just pretend that someone had taken it, I took it as a bit childish, and went straight to my manager. We basically kept the phone in his office and waited for the woman to most likely come back the next day. 

And so it was, I saw the woman in the parking lot and went back to the manager. He asked me to give it to her since he was on a call, I greeted her and tried to tell her what had happened, but she just interrupted me with questions like ""Why do you have it? Did you try to rob me? Did you go through my phone?"" 

I really tried to explain to her that it was a misunderstanding, until she demanded to speak to the manager. The manager came out of his office a few minutes later to deal with this angry woman. Apparently she managed to calm down but she never apologized or anything

I went back to work and only received comments fromde  my coworkers saying things like ""Why did you returned the phone? That woman didn't deserve it.""

1gcprhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gcprhm/sf_joe_gays_world_of_wonders/,[SF] Joe Gay‚Äôs World of Wonders,"Joe Gay wasn‚Äôt merely a man‚Äîhe was the glitch in the universe‚Äôs software, a cosmic bug with human skin. His existence was a living contradiction, a crack in reality where logic and absurdity collided like supernovae. Every time he blinked, a galaxy blinked back, and the air around him seemed to hum with the distorted echoes of infinite timelines.

Joe‚Äôs mornings were less a routine and more a cosmic event. While most people scrambled eggs, Joe inadvertently scrambled spacetime. When he cracked an egg, entire star clusters swirled out, spiraling into nebulae on his countertop. His frying pan wasn‚Äôt just a pan‚Äîit was a gravitational anomaly, warping light and devouring matter. Time stuttered and bent as he flipped his cosmic creation, while parallel universes collided somewhere between the toast and jam. His toast itself wasn‚Äôt mere bread but fragments of ancient civilizations, burnt to a crisp. And his coffee? Forget beans‚Äîhis brew was distilled from the remnants of dead stars, each sip a direct infusion of dark energy, bending reality with every gulp.

Joe‚Äôs kitchen was an interdimensional riddle disguised in IKEA cabinetry. His fridge didn‚Äôt hold leftovers‚Äîit contained frozen moments from alternate realities, and occasionally, the odd dinosaur steak. His microwave? A device capable of converting lasagna into mathematical paradoxes, beaming them straight into the fabric of space. When his food beeped ‚Äúdone,‚Äù it wasn‚Äôt just cooked‚Äîit was rewritten.

But none of this compared to The Spoon. At first glance, it was a dull, tarnished utensil, the kind you‚Äôd toss out during spring cleaning. But in Joe‚Äôs hands, The Spoon was the keystone of existence, a tool capable of stirring not just coffee but entire universes. With each stir, it resonated with the hum of collapsing stars, vibrating on frequencies that made the cosmos itself shudder. As Joe absentmindedly twirled The Spoon, it bent the laws of physics with the ease of a magician‚Äôs flourish.

Afternoons found Joe in the park, feeding pigeons like any other eccentric local. Except his pigeons weren‚Äôt just birds‚Äîthey were cosmic travelers, their feathers shimmering with the light of quasars, their eyes reflecting galaxies that had yet to form. As Joe tossed crumbs of fractured reality to them, the pigeons gobbled them up, storing bits of alternate dimensions in their beaks.

One day, while polishing The Spoon in the half-light of his apartment, a tear split open the fabric of reality. From it emerged a figure‚Äîa patchwork being of mismatched realities, a sentient anomaly born from failed universes. Its voice wasn‚Äôt a sound but an experience, like witnessing the death of a thousand suns. ‚ÄúYou toy with forces beyond comprehension,‚Äù it intoned, its form flickering between realities.

Joe didn‚Äôt bat an eye. He spun The Spoon between his fingers, smirking. ‚ÄúGot a spoon I can borrow?‚Äù The figure hesitated, then conjured its own spoon‚Äîan artifact forged from forgotten timelines. The two spoons resonated, and the sound sent shockwaves through the cosmos. Stars winked out, black holes collapsed, and time held its breath. But Joe just laughed‚Äîa sound that rippled through the multiverse. The dance of cosmic absurdity was far from over.

Meanwhile, not far from Joe‚Äôs temporal vortex, Jorge Stavros led an almost comically mundane life. His greatest obsession? Spoons. But not just any spoons‚Äîhe sought out the rarest, most obscure spoons from every corner of the world. His mornings were spent arranging these relics with a precision that bordered on religious fervor. Jorge didn‚Äôt even like tea, but his collection demanded the perfect spoon for every conceivable stir.

Jorge‚Äôs afternoons were equally peculiar. He fed pigeons while balancing on one foot, a ritualistic act that felt significant in ways he couldn‚Äôt articulate. Then one evening, after acquiring a particularly elusive spoon from Iceland, his phone rang. No one was on the line‚Äîjust static. Returning to his shrine of spoons, he found them missing, as if they had never existed.

Jorge didn‚Äôt know that he had been living in the wrong timeline. When the true owner of his apartment returned from a two-week vacation, they found Jorge standing on one foot, surrounded by pigeons. The two men locked eyes in mutual confusion. Jorge, ever unruffled, simply asked, ‚ÄúDo you have a spoon I can borrow?‚Äù

Without a word, the owner handed him a spoon, then shuffled off to bed, as if this bizarre exchange was just another Tuesday. Outside, stars flickered, time hiccupped, and in some distant corner of the multiverse, Joe Gay smiled, stirring his coffee as the universe whispered back.",1,1729962398.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

So a little background on myself, I was a functioning alcoholic for many many years and decided to quit it out of my life. I first met kava and that helped to be able to at least have ‚Äúsomething‚Äù but it got old. I recently turned to Kratom. 

I‚Äôve only been using Kratom for about 3 months now, it was going great! I did notice I had to start increasing my dose slowly to feel the same effects. I mainly use red strains at night after work to relax. I started with 2-4 teaspoons at night‚Ä¶ like I said it‚Äôs been 3 months and now I‚Äôm up to 10-15 teaspoons. 

I do the toss and wash method, sometimes I mix it in my coffee but can only put so much in it. I realize I probably just need to take a long break to get rid of some tolerance but with other things this never helps much. My body seems to always have a high tolerance to pretty much anything. I‚Äôm a red head some people say that has a lot to do with it but I don‚Äôt know. 

Anyways, recently my dose at night has started to give me terrible gas cramps, just out of the blue when it wasn‚Äôt giving me any stomach issues at all this whole time. Any advice on why that could be happening? For now I decided just to take a break cause getting gas cramps all night with barely any effects from kratom is pointless now. I really enjoy using it at night though after work and now this just sucks. 

Two main questions is: what‚Äôs the best way to reset your Kratom tolerance, also what would be causing sudden gas cramps from kratom? 

I thought maybe I should try green or white strains? Maybe that would make some difference? I just love the sedate effect from red strains. 

Any advice is appreciated! 

Ps, I usually toss and wash with milk because that seems to hide the taste the best‚Ä¶ I tried just plain water thinking maybe the cramps were from the milk but it made no difference. ",1,1729962228.0,KratomKorner,5,1.0,False
1gcpp3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gcpp3e/seeking_confirmation_about_exposure_therapy/,seeking confirmation about exposure therapy,"After 3 weeks of exposure therapy, I'm amazed at how well it actually works - definitely not the myth I initially thought it was. Before starting, I was in a miserable state for over 2 years, dealing with this awful chest tightness near my heart that made me feel like I was dying. I used to think fighting and ignoring these feelings was the solution, but that only made everything worse, leading to mini panic attacks that eventually became major ones. I was honestly close to quitting my job and going all-in on therapy and medication.

Then I discovered exposure therapy, and things started changing. I learned to listen to and observe my anxiety instead of fighting it, understanding it's just my brain's protective mechanism - that ancient fight-or-flight response trying to keep me safe. The problem is, in our modern world, simple things like drinking coffee, experiencing a faster heart rate, or even meeting people can trigger this response. My personal triggers include coffee, cigarettes, increased heart rate, muscle twitches, and getting high AF due to bad experiences with drugs.

Here's what I'm curious about from others who've done this therapy: 

Do you experience that intense feeling of being detached from reality like DPDR but stronger and more constant ? 

and that weird phase where you temporarily lose hope and question life's meaning?

 And does anyone else get that strange mix of calmness and discomfort while practicing anxiety acceptance? Would love to hear about your experiences with these symptoms during the exposure therapy process.

1gcpoon,https://www.reddit.com/r/BadMonkeyTVSeries/comments/1gcpoon/spoilers_well_that_was_kind_of_a_waste_of_8_hours/,(Spoilers) well that was kind of a waste of 8 hours ,"Finally finished the show.  TBH I feel snookered and regretful of my tendency to want to finish what I start.

The first few episodes of this are pretty appealing -- the initial hook (heh), leading up to the reveal about Nick, the backstory with the Scrubs guy, Yancy's conflict with the guy who just bought a boat, the side conflict with the bad lieutenant, all entertaining while still allowing for the light dramedy that is typical of Hiaasen's books. 

But hoo boy what a mess it descends into.  Plot-wise, tone-wise, production, performance, it all falls apart .

First and foremost, let's face it: Vince Vaughn is a terrible actor.  He is one of those guys who gets by on charm but it's lacking here and he sleepwalks through this with a laughable hairline and a robotic delivery. The character is increasingly badly written as the show goes on in an attempt to play on the stock Vaughn motormouth schtick. I watched the scene where Rosa leaves on the plane in disbelief as VV, who's supposed to be torn by internal conflict, holds the same blank expression he has ordering coffee.

About the time our heroes arrive on Andros it becomes what Roger Ebert called an ""Idiot Plot"" for two episodes.  Nobody's actions or decisions make any sense except to set up the ending.  

The Bahamian sub-plot also started with great promise but became increasingly muddled and nonsensical.  Gracie's transition back to the Dragon Queen comes out of nowhere and the approach to the magic element was inconsistent and ham-fisted.  

Nick is another character that they never found a tone for.  I am a fan of Rob Delaney but he couldn't do much with the constant shifting of view from comic to despicable to sympathetic.  

Then there's the hurricane.  Built up to for multiple episodes then takes place completely off-screen.  If I recall the storm is a major factor in the book, so I can only conclude that it was a budget decision.  There were other places where the story seemed to be changed on the fly to meet a budget and the weather.  Several of the plot points (Bonnie, and he lovebirds and the yellow house, Yancy's job) were closed in the most lazy and unrealistic way possible.

I could go on but won't.  
     
The actress who played Eve was the discovery and redeeming factor, will have to keep an eye on her.   Always great to see Scott Glenn.  I'd watch a spinoff show based on Yancy's partner before I'd watch a second Yancy season.   ",0,1729962187.0,BadMonkeyTVSeries,1,0.33,False

I just moved here (from the US) and I have to take MiraLax (PEG), known here as macrogol, every day for my IBS-C.

I am used to buying it in the big containers that contain \~750g of it, without any electrolytes or flavors or anything. I'm used to putting it in my coffee in the morning since it doesn't have a flavor and it makes it less obviously thick if it's a hot beverage. Also, I only take about 1/2 dose (8g) usually.

So since I moved here, I've only been able to find the sachets that have a fixed dose (13g), and have a ton of other added stuff. I'm okay with the electrolytes, but there's also sorbitol, lactulose, and all these flavorings. So it tastes sweet, salty, and has this artificial ""citrus"" flavor I find repulsive.

First off, the inability to customize my dose has made my BM situation very turbulent, and I think the sorbitol is making me very bloated. I end up having to juggle half-empty packets, which is a pain especially if I go on vacation.

Also.. it tastes godawful. In coffee, in the 50 kinds of tea I've tried, nothing can mingle well with or cover the flavor. The most inoffensive thing is iced water but I still hate it and have to chug it and think happy thoughts.

I've even been trying ""natural"" alternatives: psyllium husk, prune juice, etc. but they don't work at the level I need them to.

My migraines have gone from one every month at the most to every other day. I had an extremely stressful summer, bought my first car and moved apartments all in the span of august. Two weeks into the new place: boom, migraines every other day. Theyve been steady since. All other factors are pretty static - stress level (if anything has gone down), coffee/ alcohol consumption, amount working, diet, sleep. This apartment is the biggest change 

It is a beautiful apartment, the nicest I‚Äôve ever had. All new appliances, went through significant renovations and remained vacant for atleast a couple weeks before we moved in. Very clean. My downstairs neighbors are a mess though, constantly partying and I caught a glimpse through their open door the other day - stains on the wall, dirty flooring, possibly smoking inside. Could possible be affecting the air quality upstairs?

Given the timeline, clearly something within it is causing my migraines. I am buying an air purifier for my bedroom. I am going to check the ac filter and replace. What else can I do? Has anybody had this experience before? ",2,1729961865.0,migraine,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a musician and the long periods of retention over the years (many separate streaks) have contributed greatly to my art. I felt powerful.

I have been 1) vaping , before that it was cigarettes which I no longer indulge in but it‚Äôs not like vaping is any better. 2) far too much caffeine , I‚Äôm talking cappuccinos and also Coke Zero. High caffeine intake and this path doesn‚Äôt work. 3) Alcohol. Even though I‚Äôm not a big drinker when I do indulge perhaps once a month it leads to the dreaded relapse. 

In order to combat this : No vape , one black coffee in my small mug a day (this habit got me to nine months of SR before) , no Coke Zero or any fizzy drinks and no alcohol.

I‚Äôve found the people you spend time with as well have a great impact on you also. I will try to spend time with high vibe people.

1gcpht1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Empaths/comments/1gcpht1/i_believe_i_dated_a_sociopath/,I believe I dated a sociopath ,"Hello to you fellow empaths,

I (30yrs old male) met a (27yrs old female) on the 18th of February this year. (Exactly one day after I turned 30 yrs old...how strange).

Our relationship only lasted 4 months (we broke up on the 26th of June).

When we sat down for our first coffee she told me ""I checked your Instagram just to make sure you're not a psychopath""

The first two weeks were incredible. As she opened up about her traumatic past I learned that she had an abusive father and that she is epileptic. I could relate to that very much because I also lost my father and I also have an incurable skin condition called rosacea.

She also mentioned her last two ex's were narcissists and they manipulated her, isolated her and raped her in all ways possible.

Lastly she also mentioned to me that she lost her best male friend from suicide. He did it for no real apparent reason according to her words. She wears a medallion daily with a picture of him inside.

She was the kindest soul I'd ever seen.
She did kind things like helping elderly in the streets. I could feel a confidence in her that I had never felt before. Truely fearless.

After two beautiful weeks she told me she would sadly have to move back to Paris because she couldn't get a job.
Of course I reacted and showed her my attachement.

Two days later she asked me if I was down to meet a male friend of hers. I agreed.
Upon meeting the guy late at night in a bar I asked him (while she was ordering beers) what was the nature of their relationship.
Man to man the guy told me their relationship was for ""pleasure""
I didn't know it at the time but I had just been triangulated for a threesome.
We went back to the guys apartment that evening but nothing happened. 
She told me with a smirk that she had previously ""fucked"" a guy while listening to Pink Floyd (she knew it was my favorite band).

A week later she did some jealousy inducing behaviors. Very subtle stuff like lighting a guys cigarette and saying ""I'm lightning you up"".

2 months later I was in the parasitic stage where she would call me on a daily basis (which threw me off because I thought if she's so present in my life then it must mean she loves me).
She'd come in my apartment and sleep all day.

She tried to isolate me by making me think there was no guarantee that my mother would inherit me. Through love I gradually started to distance myself from my family.
I also saw my friends less because this woman was taking a tall in my life.
I wanted to figure her out badly.
Of course I picked up on the bad vibes she was giving from day one. I sensed some good and bad and I couldn't put my finger on what was wrong. It was only a matter of time I thought.

One day she saw a beautiful dog lying on the terrace of a caf√© with the two persons owning the dog. She clearly noticed the dog and greeted him as we walked into the caf√©.
As we got back out of the caf√© she was holding the platter with the two hot cups of coffee as I held the door for her.
She then tripped over the dog and spilled the hot coffee onto the dog. Needless to say it looked like and accident but in retrospect I think it was intentional.

One day I had an eye infection and had to see an ophthalmologist urgently. She came along and saw my discomfort by having my eyes stretched wide open.
Later the same day, she made me watch a movie and told me that ""this scene"" was dedicated to me.
The ""scene"" depicted a woman being strapped on a chair at the ophthalmologist with her eyelids firmly held with metallic clamps. As the ophthalmologist walks out of the room the machine malfunction and the laser burns her eyes. Needless to say the woman in the movie dies horrendously.

I paused the movie and asked my ""girlfriend"" why on earth she would show me this. 
As she looked at me with a smirk she said ""I don't know"".

Her main picture for socials are a picture of her and a mime wearing a mask. And she's doing a heart shape with her hands.
I had seen this picture non stop as she would call me daily throughout the 4 months of our relationship.

She talked about her ass the following day in a bar as I was sitting on front of her. The men around us started checking her out and whispering stuff into her ear. As she looked at me proudly with ""that smirk"" I knew our relationship was over. My torelance had been reached.

I broke up with her and she called me a coward. Me who had done everything I could to support her, her epilepsy, her shitty job. She didn't even have a diploma.

As she left in anger I could feel something wasn't right about this whole thing.
I went online and checked ""narcissist""
The pictures that showed up were masks, white masks just like the white mask the mime is wearing on her social picture.

The deception was so strong I couldn't believe she lied to me from day one.
Made me meet her sister who also called me crazy when I explained what happened.

Worse thing is, when she told me early in the two first week upon meeting her ""I like domination"" I thought she was talking about sex... Lol

When she told me her favorite movies were Hannibal Lecter, the Truman show, the wave (movie about a totalitarian regime-control and power).

When she told me her dream job would be working for the CIA...

When she told me her ""best"" male friend committed suicide for no reason... I got it so clear I almost threw myself out of the window as well.

She proceeded to stalk me through the whole month of July. I sat down at her coffee table asking for an explanation or closure. I got slapped in the face in front of 30 people including children as she learned that I had contacted her boss. 

I am now involved in a law case with her.
She's the one who filled a complaint against me for calumny and death threats.

Indeed I made her lose her job because she's the one who made me meet her boss (which I always told her wasn't good).
I called the boss as I ended in the hospital for suicidal thoughts. I hadn't eaten in a week nor slept. I couldn't stand up.
I called the boss for several reasons, the injustice of it all, she walked into my life to witness my destruction, she is a real danger and a sadist and I think it was the right thing to do out of moral civil obligation. Duty.

I never wanted to hurt her nor play her shitty ""smear campaign"" childish games but I had to...

Like in WW1 the German used gas and so did the french after a while, everyone knew it was bad...lol.

I'm having a difficult time accepting that this woman is a sadist and that she could treat me so poorly despite all the love and the eye contact (soul to soul) I gave her.
Pushing me into doing things I didn't want to do, sodomy for example. Real hardcore shit you know?

I'm not sure wether she is a narcissist or a sociopath but I certainly know that all of it is premeditated.

From this abusive relationship I have learned that I am an empath. An HPE as we call it in french. ""Haut potentiel √©motionnel"".
It explained a lot of my past and it was a true revelation.

I've been in the US healthcare mill since late May: urgent care diagnosis was ""muscle spasms"". Not feeling relief from whatever pharmaceutical solution the urgent care doc prescribed, I landed in an orthopedic practice a few weeks later (pain management, unbeknownst to me). MRI revealed spinal stenosis (L4&L5), and epidural cortisone injection took place on 7/8. 

A few weeks later, I started PT. Had no desire to wait for the PT practice which is part of the orthopedic practice, so they outsourced me to another PT practice across the intersection. My issues were tolerable with PT (but still noticeable), and I was beginning to get back into normal activities.

Several weeks into PT, the last stretch the PT did involved taking a 3"" canvas strap in a figure 8 - one loop around his shoulders, the other around my left (bum) ankle, and as he began to give it a slow pull, I felt the end of the range of motion, and then tearing of flesh in the groin area. My words were, ""you opened something up, for sure!""

I had realized in August I was not doing myself any favors carrying around 80 extra pounds (menopause has not been kind to me). On 9/7, I start with weekly injections of terzepatide (name brand = zepbound, but due to shortages from Eli Lilly, compounding pharmacies were authorized to fill generic variants, and ... it's big business). I drop about 15 lbs in five weeks, but still a way to go...

The hyper extension of my hip happened 6 days after the first shot.

Now, here's where things get interesting. Terzepitide side effects include constipation. Within a week of the hip hyperextension, I wind up on four more prescriptions with varying degrees of digestive impact.

I go 3 weeks, pooping 2x!!! I'm experimenting with stool softeners, chewables, smooth move tea, miralax. I finally landed on stirring in a teaspoon of miralax into my morning coffee to ensure I go on a regular basis (worst case now is every other day). 

Oh, and I was diagnosed with diverticulosis in 2020, so me getting backed up is no Bueno. Hence, the exercise in me hitting the laxative aisle at the pharmacy and in one fell swoop with one arm, emptying the shelves into my cart on the quest to üí© was quite intentional.

But where it gets interesting is this: I have an alarm bell of pain around the descending colon into the sigmoid/rectum turn that sounds off before I head to the restroom to evacuate the bowels.

I have an appointment with my GI doc scheduled in early Dec (and I'm waitlisted if something comes up sooner).

For those who have been diagnosed with Cauda Aquina, assuming it is before you lost control of your bowels, was the rush of pain prior to pooping a symptom? 

It's a very low grade ache at all other times.

And I can't decide if it's the sudden pile on of meds with the terzepitide, or if it's the nerve issues (aggravated by the hip injury) that have brought about the bowel pain.

I had the second round of injections this past week. Not really any improvement (still in the window of it's time to be effective), but definitely want to find the right words to advocate for myself here, and not sure how worried I should be about my bowel issues.",3,1729961648.0,SpinalStenosis,2,1.0,False

Would a handshake be better, or should I go for a hug? (I‚Äôm a bit worried a hug might feel too forward, since it‚Äôs our first time meeting in person.)

ZAIA
‚ÄúI have some good news, Zaia. Sebastian will be so excited. Congratulations, you‚Äôre pregnant!‚Äù The doctor‚Äôs words ring in my mind as I stare down at the test reports once again, as I leave the hospital.
‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù I say, as I avoid bumping into someone, my heart skipping a beat as I place a hand on my stomach protectively, hurrying towards my awaiting car.
My driver, Ethan, is waiting beside the sleek black car and he opens the door for me, bowing his head.
‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù I say as I get in gracefully.
‚ÄúWhere to, ma‚Äôam?‚Äù he asks once he gets in the car.
‚ÄúHome,‚Äù I say, unable to suppress my smile, excitement bubbling through me.
This is actually happening. I‚Äôve been trying for a baby for three years and finally‚Ä¶ finally, I am pregnant.
I want to shout it from the rooftop, tell everyone that yes! I‚Äôm pregnant with the heir to the pack! But I contain my excitement. I need to tell Sebastian the good news first.
Sebastian is the Alpha of the Dark Hollow Falls pack. It is one of the largest packs on the eastern side of the state.
However, with the large territory also comes the dangerous borders that roam with rogues, ready to tear apart anyone who gets in their way.
Werewolves spend their entire lives searching and hoping to find their destined mates. As for me, I had a crush on Bastien from the moment I had seen him when I was eleven years old.
That crush never went away and when he turned out to be my fated mate, it had been a dream come true and we had married.
He desperately wanted an heir, and which Alpha doesn‚Äôt? I had just turned eighteen when I found him, but he was thirty one at the time. Many other alphas have sons who are already being trained to become the next alphas at his age.
‚ÄúMake haste, Ethan, I have a lot to do today,‚Äù I say to the driver as I sit back against the plush leather seat.
Reaching our large gated mansion, I step inside and head straight to the kitchen, my stilettos echoing on the wooden floors. I will cook his favourite pudding and place the reports underneath the plate!
‚ÄúYou may take the evening off, get some rest,‚Äù I say to the maid, Emma. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll cook for us tonight.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, thank you, Luna!‚Äù she says, placing down the dish towel she had been holding. ‚ÄúI am certain Alpha will absolutely be so happy if you make him his favourite dessert! Not to mention he doesn‚Äôt like sweet things, but your pudding is something he can‚Äôt resist!‚Äù
I can‚Äôt help but smile at her words. Yes, Sebastien doesn‚Äôt enjoy sweet things aside from me and the cream pie that he loves.
My cheeks heat as I remember the first time he had told me that it‚Äôs now his second favourite dessert, and in hopes of making his favourite dessert, I had asked him what his favourite was. Only for him to smirk and reply; you.
I can‚Äôt help but smile from ear to ear, the elated feeling creating a pleasant buzz around me as I get to work wanting everything to be perfect for his return.
Hours pass and when everything is almost ready, I change into something pretty and set up the dining table with candles and the food.
‚ÄúAlmost 9pm‚Ä¶‚Äù he will be home soon.
With the troubles that have surrounded our borders, as well as having to run the business, Sebastian often works until late into the night. But he would try to come home by 9.30pm and continue working from home if necessary.
I sit down on the chair, watching the clock tick away, the sound loud in the room's silence.
Once again, I look down at my stomach, smiling softly as I await the return of my mate.
Time passes slowly and soon 11 o‚Äôclock comes and goes, but I‚Äôm not deterred, maybe I will reheat the food again‚Ä¶
I have just placed the reheated meals on the table when my head jerks up at the sound of footsteps, making my heart thud at the sudden sound. I look toward the door excitedly.
Finally, he is home!
The front door shuts, and a familiar faint scent of my mate hits my nose.
I cast a swift glance at the clock on the wall. To my surprise, it‚Äôs past midnight.
I rush to the hall, the excitement of finally being able to tell him the good news filling me. There he is, in the dimly lit hall. He still looks as handsome as ever.
Three and a half years on, he still makes my heart skip a beat whenever I see him.
He loosens his black tie, as he places his briefcase down, holding a few files in his hands as well. His bright blue eyes look tired as they meet mine and I smile.
‚ÄúSebastian!‚Äù I rush over to him, wrapping my arms around his neck.
He catches me with one arm, but there‚Äôs no enthusiasm. He must have had a really hard day. I don‚Äôt mind; I know how stressful things are at work lately.
Placing me back on the floor, he raises a brow as he looks down at me.
‚ÄúWhy are you awake at this time?‚Äù he asks me in his deep, rugged voice.
‚ÄúI was waiting for you. I wanted to have dinner together. There‚Äôs something I wanted to tell you,‚Äù I explain as I help him out of his jacket, brushing a piece of lint from his white shirt that is no longer as crisp as it was this morning.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve already eaten,‚Äù he replies, surprising me as heads towards the living room. ‚ÄúI have something to tell you.‚Äù
‚ÄúOk, you go first,‚Äù I say as he drops onto the sofa, stretching his long legs, and resting his arm on the back of the sofa.
I sit down beside him, knowing he would share something regarding the work meeting. After all, I am knowledgeable on these matters and he‚Äôd often get my opinion on his ideas.
However, there‚Äôs something off. There‚Äôs a coldness in his eyes as he looks into mine.
Sebastian looks down at the file in his hands before he tosses it on the table, the loud snap as it hits the table makes me jump.
‚ÄúRead it.‚Äù
I take it uneasily and flip open the blank file, but the red words in bold print at the top of the first page make my blood run cold.
‚ÄòDIVORCE AGREEMENT‚Äô
I gasp as I quickly scan the document. That feeling becomes worse. This is a divorce agreement with our name on it‚Ä¶ My entire body trembles as I look up at him, hurt and confused.
‚ÄúW-why?‚Äù I manage to blurt out as I look at the man I love from the bottom of my heart.
What went wrong?
‚ÄúAnnalise is back, and she‚Äôs rejoined the pack.‚Äù
I look up sharply. It‚Äôs suddenly hard to breathe.
‚ÄúBut I am your mate,‚Äù I whisper. How could he still care for Annalise? She was his past. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been married for three years.‚Äù
‚ÄúOur marriage was a mistake from the very beginning. Back then, my father demanded that I marry my mate, but now I don‚Äôt want to be bound by the Goddess‚Äô arrangement. I don‚Äôt see the point of fated mates.‚Äù
My heart clenches. I look at his face, trying to understand what he‚Äôs thinking, but there‚Äôs nothing that reveals his feelings and he has his walls up, blocking the mate bond.
‚ÄúBut your father, he-‚Äù
‚ÄúMy Mom is not my father‚Äôs mate, but she still gave birth to me. She gave him a powerful Alpha son and even after he found his mate, he stayed by her side, rejecting his mate. I will never understand his reason for wanting me with my destined mate when he himself is proof that you don‚Äôt need your mate.‚Äù
Those words are worse than being stabbed a thousand times, and I can feel my eyes prickle with tears, the agony my wolf is feeling consuming me.
Does he really think that is the truth? Annalise is my half-sister and although she and Sebastian had dated, I know her truth, the real her that she hides behind her pretty face and doe eyes.
‚ÄúAnnalise only approached you because you were an Alpha‚Ä¶ Sebastian, she doesn‚Äôt love you the way I do. She wants to be Luna-‚Äù
He kicks the solid oak coffee table, making me jump as it‚Äôs thrown over with a loud crash, hitting the wooden floor with a deafening bang that makes the ornaments in the glass cabinet shake.
‚ÄúAnd what about you? You just want to be Luna, don‚Äôt you! You knew that Annalise and I were in a relationship, yet you selfishly accepted the marriage anyway and betrayed your own sister by taking her man! You lied to me. She‚Äôs told me everything!‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs not true. Let me explain-‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt antagonise me, Zaia, you got what you wanted, you became my wife and Luna, but that wasn‚Äôt enough for you. You forced Annalise from coming anywhere near this pack because you knew once she returned, I would learn everything!‚Äù
Yes, I did want Annalise to leave, but I never made her leave. She left of her own accord once she learned Sebastian had found his mate, but now, it‚Äôs almost as if she has been planning her return all this time.
Is she really enough to come between what we have? Sadly, I look into his eyes, realising he never trusted me. He‚Äôs now judging and calculating everything I gave him with suspicion, as if I had played him to gain the position of Luna.
Doesn‚Äôt he realise I fell for him before I even knew he was an Alpha? Has he always been wary of me? That one person can come between us and ruin it all? Did he even for a moment, truly love me wholeheartedly?
I can‚Äôt understand it. Tell me Bastian‚Ä¶ If you didn‚Äôt want me, then why did you make love to me? Why did you touch me like I was the only woman who mattered to you?
Taking a deep breath, I ask him the decisive question. ‚ÄúSebastian‚Ä¶ Tell me, if it wasn‚Äôt your father‚Äôs request-‚Äú
‚ÄúThen I would have rejected you, and even now, I will, for Annalise.‚Äù
My lips quiver, remembering how my father hadn‚Äôt been happy with me marrying him. He never liked Sebastian‚Äôs family, yet I had given it all up for him.
My family‚Ä¶ my inheritance and my position, but it was clearly not enough for him.
If he‚Äôs able to cast me aside so easily, then what is my use?
He exhales as if I‚Äôm an irritating child and takes out a lighter and cigarette.
‚ÄúSign the papers soon. I don‚Äôt want this to drag out,‚Äù he says.
I stare down at the file as a single tear splashes onto the papers.
‚ÄúWhat did you want to tell me?‚Äù he asks.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no longer important‚Ä¶ forget about it,‚Äù I say, thinking he will never see the papers that currently sit on the dining room table.
‚ÄúIf you have any concerns regarding the alimony, let me know. Your expenses will be covered and you are welcome to stay in the pack.‚Äù
That hurts.
‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no need. Everything is fine as it is. I will sign and have these returned to you immediately,‚Äù I reply as I stand up, trying to hold myself together when my entire world has come crashing down around me.
He pauses for a second and simply nods, uncaring about my heartbreak and agony that I know he can feel through the bond. Could he really cast me, his own mate, aside for another woman?
The answer is in front of me, and although it is painful, the truth is yes, yes, he could.
‚ÄúYou may remain here for tonight. It‚Äôs late anyway. Annalise won‚Äôt move in until everything is settled. I don‚Äôt want her to feel uncomfortable.‚Äù
I stare up into his handsome face, trying to recognise the man I fell for.
I smile bitterly and nod at him.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll be gone. Say hi to Annalise for me.‚Äù

I have never been so bearish on a field in my entire life. Every design document I write now, which I‚Äôm writing for a major well known service with hundreds of thousands of tps, I run through an LLM. I put down some garbled requirements, grab 20 design docs already written by the team, and it fills in 95% of the gaps on my new doc. This is passing the quality bar of L7 engineers 

When I check in code, I run every function though an LLM and it writes better idiomatic code than I did. 

I believe in almost nothing in life. But I do believe that software engineering as we know it is already over. Companies will take a long time to fully embed the new type of engineering. 

Low end and mid skill devs will never make over 150k, and it will be a dog fight for those positions. There will still be 500k+ engineers. But if you‚Äôre on this sub, you should be asking how to leave the field completely, not how to get a quick raise.

You guys aren‚Äôt getting it. I don‚Äôt think ai is just going to write a whole new backend, just that the barrier to entry is way lower.

Stockfish trained and ready for action
Raised by Robots
The First OTB Chess Game I ever played

In May, I decided that I was tired of playing robots (my account is restricted, see previous entries for additional information). I needed to play humans. It‚Äôs true that the best in the world against robots isn‚Äôt necessarily the best against humans. I would have told you that I didn‚Äôt really believe that I was worthy of playing titled players in person. The motivating factor for me to play in-person was a determination to prove myself wrong. Because no matter what I said, I absolutely believed that I was as strong as any FIDE Master, that my strength was close to international master. So I did what any motivated procrastinator would do. I signed up to play, purchased a clock and a chess board. Instead of playing games, the night before the tournament, I set up the board and looked at the clock. It didn‚Äôt have batteries. I still have never used it.

I read a list of rules that you should be aware of in tournaments. The main one that stuck with me was to use the same hand to move a piece as you use the hit the clock. Second, you castle with one hand. Third, if you touch a piece, you must move it.

With these rules in mind and a 15 minute session staring at the chess board, I went to sleep. And then I woke up 20 minutes before the tournament started. With no coffee, no time to brush my teeth or find nice clothes, I ran out the door. I forgot my board and clock. In my previous post I discuss what happened from there.

The outcome was far from disproving myself. If anything, my results at the state blitz championship proved that I was just as good as I thought. Much, much better than I would have told you or anyone else before that day. And so I decided, even though I had finished one game short of state champion, to continue playing. And I set my sights on a classical tournament a couple weeks later.

I had never played a game of classical chess. This was a 60 minute game with 30 second increment. I had only played 16 games of blitz chess over the board ‚Äî in the last 20 years! It seemed an impossible task to perform well against tournament regulars. So when I showed up for the tournament, my expectations were a bit lower than International Master.

In the first game, my opponent made a mistake out of the opening. I immediately saw that, by developing his bishop on F4, I could grab the center and after a pawn trade, fork his bishop and knight, winning a piece. I believe in converting material advantages, so I played a ridiculous move to re-route his remaining bishop (the LSB) and further sacrifice a knight for an unstoppable checkmate attack.

It was robotic. It was a ridiculous sequence (the full game is below).I barely used any time on it. Thus, the game attracted suspicion. The only thing was that I miscalculated. My opponent could have easily stopped checkmate and my sacrifice would have been a game-losing blunder. So now I had won against a 1000 USCF player, attracted suspicion, but it was for no reason. And I had won the first game of classical chess I ever played, and I then played the national champion of his age group. Yes, it was a kid, but the kid could play chess. We had an incredible game with myself on the attack, and him defending as well as he could. I found a 3 move tactic, temporarily sacrificed my queen, and won easily. That game is included below as well.

I don‚Äôt think this did much to calm suspicions. I don‚Äôt know what a robot would play like (as opposed to how a human plays). I only play against robots. I can find any move they can. I‚Äôm not sure I appreciate the difference.

But in the next round, I had the black pieces. My opponent gave me a fake name. He gave me a fake lichess user name. He kept stalling and asking ridiculous questions to the tournament director. He didn‚Äôt even show up the next day. Maybe things had gotten into my head, but he played a perfect game and I lost when I screwed up my technique bringing the king to the corner to induce a stalemate. In any case, I lost. I included much of that game below but the notation was screwed up.

And now people were whispering about me, calling me a cheater, and I was alone. I was the only one there who was completely alone. Nobody cheering for me. Nobody watching my opponents. I lost the last 2 games. And a few weeks later I played one more tournament that made this one look like the best time of my life.

* **For Dad üéß:** If he‚Äôs into tech, wireless earbuds are always a good call. Another favorite is a high-quality coffee thermos ‚Äì great for on-the-go and super practical.
* **For Siblings üïπÔ∏è:** Try a fun game or a quirky gadget! Board games are great for game night fans, and for the techy sibling, look into unique gadgets like mini projectors or phone stands.
* **For Grandparents üì∑:** A digital photo frame filled with family photos can be so meaningful, or a subscription box for their favorite hobby (gardening, reading, etc.).
* **For Teenagers üé®:** Personalized gifts like custom jewelry or something creative, like an art kit, are perfect for younger family members.
* **For the Family Pet üêæ:** Don‚Äôt forget the furry family member! A cozy pet bed or some fancy treats are sure to bring some holiday cheer!

Hope this gives you some fresh ideas! Let me know if you‚Äôve found any memorable gifts in the past ‚Äì always looking for new suggestions. üòä",0,1729960789.0,Gifts,1,0.33,False

And in the spirit of keeping momentum going to keep making changes in my life; I‚Äôve been doing my best to get out with friends in real life more and meet new people. 

One of these such adventures was me going out for dinner with four strangers. In my city (and I think it exists in several others) there‚Äôs this app where you take a compatibility test, it matches you with 4-7 strangers and then you all go for dinner at a place they make a reservation for you. You don‚Äôt get to know anything about anyone until you get there. It‚Äôs not a dating thing - just a getting to know more people thing. So in my group there was two other girls and two guys. Four out of the five of us really gelled well and it was a good night with lots of fun conversation and laughter. Everyone asked for my contact info after which made me feel like I really was a part of the group and that people enjoyed spending time with me.

Only one guy reached out to me after though. But our text conversations were really great; I was laughing all the time. We decided to meet up the next week for coffee. I didn‚Äôt think it was a date but also didn‚Äôt think it wasn‚Äôt; if that makes sense? He showed up a little late. But again in person we were having really great conversations and things were going well‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ until my Dad called saying I needed to drive him to the hospital because my grandma had fallen and developed a brain bleed.

So of course my family comes first and I drop everything to go‚Ä¶. Which in hindsight might‚Äôve looked a little suspicious. I wasn‚Äôt trying to blow him off but it definitely might‚Äôve looked like I was getting a friend to bail me out of a date partway though (not something I‚Äôve ever done but I‚Äôve heard of others doing it). I texted him after I left apologizing and saying I hoped we could hang out again sometime. He responded that night‚Ä¶ but now radio silence.

I just feel like the universe is working against me. It‚Äôs so hard not to feel like it‚Äôs not even worth trying to date if it‚Äôs just going to turn out like this every time.",11,1729960765.0,ForeverAloneWomen,2,0.93,False
1gcp5kx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralOregonRetire/comments/1gcp5kx/lets_start_an_age_well_revolution_in_central/, Let's Start an Age Well Revolution in Central Oregon Assisted Living can Change! ,"What if Central Oregon became known for something beyond its stunning mountains and outdoor lifestyle? What if, starting with Sisters Senior Living, we sparked a revolution in how we approach aging and neurological health, physical health, mental health, gut health, nutritional heath - one that could spread to every senior community?

Martha steadies her coffee cup at Sisters Coffee Company, watching early light touch the Three Sisters peaks. ""Two years ago, I could paint watercolors,"" she says. ""Everyone says that's just how aging works. But what if Central Oregon showed there's a better way?""

Central Oregon is the right place for this revolution to happen.  The convergence of information, medicine, AI, robotics (this will be a LOT cooler than you think) is ready to happen.

I would ask ""Why is this not happening NOW"".   Answer:  Let's do this!  Our family deserves and has earned the right to live the BEST life they can with EVERY opportunity age well.

# A Revolution Waiting to Happen

The tools exist right now:  (This is NOT even close to comprehensive... Think sound therapy, ESTIM, Sauna, EWAT, GLT, BLT (Not a sandwich), PEMF, MHBOT, VT.   (of course, lets make sure we back this with science).  Instead of a $3000 Red light machine for 1, all of our residents would have access to it.  The same with the potential of a professional hyperbaric oxygen tank.  (Lot's of exciting opportunities if the tools are shared within a community)

Here are some more. 

* Over-the-counter continuous glucose monitoring
* Red light therapy for neurological support
* AI-driven health tracking and aI based companions. 
* Evidence-based protocols
* Advanced nutritional science

But they're not being combined. They're not being pushed to their potential. They're not being made available to everyone who could benefit.

Why not?

# Starting in Sisters, Spreading Through Central Oregon

Sisters Senior Living could help pioneer this approach:

* Never accepting ""good enough""
* Combining every available tool
* Sharing what works
* Building evidence
* Showing what's possible

Then watch it spread to:

* Bend
* Redmond
* Prineville
* Madras
* La Pine

Because every senior deserves access to better tools for aging well.

# What This Revolution Looks Like

Martha joins an afternoon discussion group, her hands steadier than this morning. ""Yesterday,"" she shares, ""someone asked why I haven't accepted my limitations. I asked why they're so quick to accept theirs.""

This revolution combines:

* Cutting-edge science
* Traditional wisdom
* Human connection
* Real-time monitoring
* Constant innovation
* Community support

# Why Central Oregon?

Our region already revolutionized:

* Outdoor lifestyle
* Brewery culture
* Remote work
* Adventure sports
* Community building

Why not senior care too?

# The Tools Are Here, The Time Is Now

We could offer every resident:

* Advanced monitoring
* Evidence-based therapies
* AI assistance
* Traditional support
* Community connection
* Cutting-edge protocols

But most importantly: The belief that we can always do better.

# Join the Revolution

This isn't just about Sisters Senior Living. It's about:

* Every senior community
* Every aging adult
* Every family watching parents age
* Every caregiver wanting better tools
* Everyone who refuses to settle

Martha ends her day attempting a small watercolor. Her hands shake less than yesterday. ""You know what excites me?"" she says. ""Not just that I might paint again. But that someone's finally asking 'why not try everything?'""

# Be Part of the Change

We're asking:

* Should Central Oregon lead this revolution?
* Would you support this approach to aging?
* What tools would you want access to?
* How can we make this available to everyone?

Because this isn't just about one community. It's about showing what's possible when we refuse to settle.

\#AgeWellRevolution #CentralOregon #NeverSettle #AgingWell r/bend  r/AssistedLiving r/RedmondOR 

Could Central Oregon spark a revolution in how we approach aging? Starting with Sisters Senior Living and spreading throughout our region, should we show what's possible when we combine every tool available to help people age well?

Share your thoughts. Because maybe it's time for our region to be known for more than mountains and microbrews. Maybe it's time we led a revolution in helping people age better.

EDIT: Your responses show how many people are ready for change. Keep sharing - help us understand how to make this revolution benefit everyone.

Hey guys. Ehm, so you ask me for the update. Well, some things happened so let me start. 

Ok, first thing is that I told everything to husband of my wife's friend that knew about the affair. At first I didn't want to do that since they have a little son but at the end I said I will. I decided I will do it when I started to answer on some of the commments from you guys where I explained her role in all of this. At the end she was the one telling my wife that she is not doing anything bad while she was cheating on me and that she should dump me for the AP so why the fuck should I feel sorry for her? 

Her husband is from the country where we live. Local guy, 42. She is 34, foreigner...I told my wife about this that I want to tell him because when I go through screenshots she gave me of their conversation I am feeling so disgusted. If her friend is capable to write something like that then she could cheat also. My wife blocked her since she wrote me that letter and doesn't have any contact with her anymore. Friend tried to reach her via other friends but my wife doesn't want to answer. Me and her husband would see each other only when our wives would hang out together. I just don't like vibe from him. Idk, there is something fishy about him...I heard some stories about him and honestly I think he never liked me a lot. 

Anyway, my wife told me if I want to tell him I can tell him. If I want her to tell him she will do it. So I wrote him long message and at the end I told him if he wants evidence about all of this I will send him. I told him I am doing this just because his wife hurt me and she was 1000 times in my house and as a man to man I don't want him to go through the same shit I did/do in the future.

He saw the message and didn't say anything. I thought he doesn't care but then after 2 hours he asked for the evidence without saying anything else. I sent him the most interesting screenshots where his wife was saying ""oh, it doesn't matter. You live only once, enjoy while you can."", ""don't try to end it, try with AP and see where it goes. No one will know, I understand you...""

So I sent him that and he called me very soon. He wanted to speak with my wife. He was pretty rude to her. Said bunch of insults like ""so she was protecting your sl*tty ass? Did you have threesomes like a real who*es?"" My wife was listening, didn't say anything and she was in her tears while watching me. After he was done she confirmed everything I wrote to him and after that she refused to speak with him anymore. He actually told me he feels sorry for me and he was glad I told him. After about an hour later his wife called my wife from different number. She started to yell at her that my wife wants to ruin her marriage after she ruined hers. Wife ended the call and blocked the number in front of me. 

Next day in tuesday husband wanted to thank me and have a drink with me but I was busy so he wrote one long message that he checked her phone and socials immediately and didn't find any evidence of infidelity from his wife. But he did find how his wife was speaking about my wife's affair to other people. During the affair she was telling few of her friends (my wife barely knows them) what my wife is doing and had great laugh with them about that. I showed that to my wife when I returned from the work and I just gave her sarcastic smile and told her ""isn't this nice"". I think she wished she is dead at that moment. She apologized immediately and tried to talk with me and started to follow me but I reminded her about the rules so she stopped and went downstairs. 

After she ended friendship with ex POS friend my wife had let say 3 friends. 1 is single and I will call her in the future ""Nam"", 2 are married. After I told husband of this POS ex friend 2 married friends also called my wife and let say attacked her. They were all one big group and would hang out together. Btw, 1 of these 2 married females was with my wife that night when she met AP. My wife met them few years ago via that POS ex friend and they are friends since then. They told her that she showed she is not good person when she is capable of doing something like this to her ex POS friend to cover her shit and to try to save our marriage and that ex POS friend is now having problems in her own marriage because of what I/wife said to her husband. I have no idea what is happening with their marriage right now but if she cheated on him it's better for her to run away from the earth. Anyway, 1 married friend blocked her after this because she is very close with ex POS friend so she took her side. Other married friend is very angry at my wife but didn't block her but they don't talk right now. So the only friend that she still has is Nam. She lived in her apartment and she is great person. Idk, I actually felt sorry for my wife when Nam told me this. My wife didn't want to tell me because we don't talk but I saw messages and she is very sad because of this. Not because of ex POS friend but because of the other 2. But hey, she only had to keep her legs closed and she would have husband, kids, family, marriage, friends...

My kids are still going twice every week to see psychologist. She told me my younger son is doing really good now but older still struggles even though he looks better. I see let say one improvement from him with my wife. He still doesn't talk with her. But she sometimes asks him and all of us do we want ice cream, something to drink, or that she can make us something to eat etc...and then my son responds, she gives him something to eat or drink and he says ""Thanks"". I know this may be funny to someone but it's still improvement. Step by step. 

Things in the house are okay. Melody drives kids in the school and from the school most of the days. She takes care of some chores, my wife cooks and does rest of the chores. They look ok together. My wife should start working from November. She will basically only work from home. She will translate a lot of documents, papers for a lot of individuals for one agency. Salary is actually pretty good. If I knew this before she could work as a translator years ago because she is really good with languages. Her socials are still deleted and she doesn't plan to activate them. She leaves house for IC meetings, to take a walks with daughter and younger son, to watch football practices of our sons and to go in the supermarket. Rest of the time she is at home doing things and doesn't go out. Nam still comes to see her almost daily(2 married friends also came once but obviously they won't anymore). She always shares the location when she leaves the house but I really don't care. She follows ""her changes"" and my rules 101% and I can say I am very satisfied with her behaviour. The only thing I don't like is that she is watching me all the time at home. I am on my phone or watching tv and then I turn my head and I can see she is watching me. She wants to talk obviously but yeah I don't need that now. She respects my rules and that's fine. Our only communication is about kids, house and normal things like ""good morning, night..."" and when she asks me do I want something to eat or drink. We will see for later but for now it's okay. Kids are doing better and that's what only matters to me. Divorce papers are ready and I can pull the trigger whenever I want. 

The biggest news is that I was intimate with other girl. It's a long story but one girl invited me to have a dinner with her before 20 days at least. But since I was alone with the kids and completely mentally unstable I never went with her on that dinner. She is ""Sung"", 28, foreigner from Asia but lives here last 4 years and she is probably the best friend of my friend's fianc√©e. When I said to my friend that my wife is coming home his fianc√©e sent Sung message about that and she texted me ""I guess no dinner then..."" Since it's much easier for me to find free time now I told her we can go in tuesday on dinner. I know her for few years. We have never been alone together, we would only see each other in the group meetings but we were ok. My wife knows her but they were never friends, not even close. My wife was not even friend with my friend's fianc√©e. I told Sung about my wife's affair in the first days when she was in the house of my friend. Friend and his fianc√©e knew and we talked about it that night so I told her also and we started to talk much more from that moment and went 2 times since then on a coffee. In tuesday we went on a dinner and it was actually pretty good. I told her already before the dinner that I don't want anything serious and she is fine with that at this moment. I thought it would be awkward but it wasn't. She lives very close to the restaurant so she invited me to her place for a ""tea"" and we were intimate. Since I wasn't intimate with any other woman last 11.5 years except with my wife I thought it would be weird but it was awesome to be honest. She is so attractive and nice to be around. I came back home in 2am. My wife was in the living room. When I left I told my boys that I am going in restaurant so she knew but didn't know the details. When I returned she was watching me but didn't say anything. I know she was waiting for me because when I entered my room I saw that she turned off the tv and went to sleep. Next days she was watching me even more but she is not saying anything because she knows the rules and I can serve her immediately.

I was yesterday again with Sung. Now we were only in her apartment. It was again great. Idk why I thought I will struggle with someone else but it's pretty good. As I said she is really attractive, has great job, funny and very smart but I can't say I have any emotional feelings for her but I like to spend time with her. She says the same for me. Anyway, I came back home in 5am. This time wife wasn't waiting for me but I could see the light was on in her room through the window. So she was awake or she was sleeping with lights on. Whatever.

Today I was with my boys whole day out. We went to shopping, in the amusment park, we went to eat and then at the end we watched football game. In the meantime my wife was with our daughter because my daughter had some kids party in the kindergarten. So they went together. Everyday my wife texts me same messages and I assumed she will at least ask when I will come home with the boys, but nothing, not a single message. Was that because she probably knows I was with the other girl last night or because of something else idk...when we returned it was 9:30pm and my wife was already sleeping with my daughter in her bed. Sons went to sleep shortly after and I am still awake.

If you ask me why I am doing this I wouldn't know exactly. I think final answer is combination of multiple factors. Me and my wife had sex like almost every day so I definitely miss that. I find Sung very attractive and this is something that helps me a lot (obviously) and I am much more relaxed. Is it too soon? I don't think so. As I said, I am not planning to enter any kind of relationship. If Sung doesn't have any problem with this type of ""agreement"" and if we are both happy then who cares...she is single, I am not single on the paper but I am in my own mind.

Is this some kind of revenge? Nah, for me no. If it is I would tell my wife or let her know somehow. I asked myself so many times why did she go to AP's place 2, 3 additional times if she says I am better looking, sex is better with me, she was not unhappy...and polygraph testing/results confirmed that...I couldn't find the answer and I think she doesn't know the answer also. At least I know why I go to see Sung. She is the type of the girl if I am single I would definitely turn around in the street to see her better. I always thought she looks great but now when I am done with my wife I think even more. Sex is amazing. She is funny and easy going and if I am single in normal conditions she is the type of the girl I would want to be with. So I know my reasons if someone asks me! But honestly, I am glad my wife is feeling like this. Let her know how I felt/feel. I expect her to explode probably tomorrow or maybe next time when I go again because in the morning before me and the boys left the house she looked like shit and was looking at me like I am the biggest enemy...as she said in her letter, we can never be 1-1. I told her that me and her are done in my eyes and she came back only because of kids. She knows that. It's not my problem she thinks we can be husband and wife again. Maybe we will, who knows, maybe in 2050. If someone told me before 30 days I would allow her to return home I would tell that person to seek help but here we are...but for now I would rather be intimate with microwave than with her. 

I am just doing what I like right now. After everything what I have been through I think I deserve at least a little bit happiness/freedom/enjoyment. I deserve to decide what I want to do when I don't have any obligation towards her anymore. I deserve to have options for my future. She had everything with me and she decided to bang some young dude just like that. If she at least knows why she did that...well, now I am doing the same except I don't care about her as we are more or less done and at least I know why I am doing this. If she asks me I will be honest with her and she can do whatever she wants except she is not allowed to do any type of chaos in my house. If she wants, she can have orgies with bunch of guys but not in my house! About everything else that involves her sexual/emotional life I really don't care at this moment.


Thank you and take care.

Hey Reddit fam! It's Derek here, aka u/solopassions, and I‚Äôve got some wild tales and nuggets of wisdom from my solo travel exploits that might just ignite the wanderlust in your soul. ‚úàÔ∏è‚ú®

Imagine this: gallivanting through Vienna, lost (both literally and metaphorically) in its mesmerizing imperial architecture, as you ponder life amidst grandiose landmarks like the Sch√∂nbrunn Palace and St. Stephen's Cathedral. That's the dream, right?

But let's keep it real - solo travel isn't all picture-perfect sunsets and flawless selfies. Oh no, folks, it's more like deciphering the cryptic art of Austrian public transport during rush hour or realizing your German is limited to ""Bratwurst"" and ""Das Boot."" Yet, these quirky challenges are what make the journey ever so exhilarating and the stories ever so memorable.

As a solo traveler, spreading your own wings is a transformative experience. You learn to savor a delectable slice of Sachertorte without fighting over the last bite, or to revel in the sheer delight of discovering hidden Viennese caf√©s where you sip coffee smoother than a Mozart sonata. Speaking of sonatas, stumbling into a random church and catching an impromptu Beethoven concert? Priceless!

Here's how solo travel flipped my world: It sharpened my senses, expanded my heart, and redefined my perspective on life and humanity. It taught me resilience, humility, and the satisfying art of walking into a restaurant solo and owning it like a boss! üí™üçΩÔ∏è

Advice? Travel alone at least once. It‚Äôs liberating. Embrace unpredictability, befriend strangers (safely), and dance to the beats of your unique adventure soundtrack. And remember, the world isn't as daunting when armed with curiosity and a trusty guide: Google Maps.

So, solo travelers, veterans or newbies, what‚Äôs your most unforgettable solo travel adventure? What mishaps turned into cherished memories? Let‚Äôs swap stories in the comments like the worldly globetrotters we all strive to be. üåçüèûÔ∏è

I have an amazing friend, someone I used to work with. He's a doctor, I was his tech. Healthiest friendship I've ever had in my whole life, probably. 

I'm not at the job anymore, but we're still friends. This happened when we worked together. 

First of all, I walked in to his office one day and asked him to change something on an order. I noticed he's left handed and I was like ""Wow..... you're a lefty. I wouldn't have guessed. You have beautiful writing. Especially for a doctor"" (because that stereotype is TOTALLY true lol)

He goes ""Thanks! I was beaten!"" 

""REALLY ME TOO!"" 

And that was the start of a beautiful trauma bond. ü§£ Except not really. We both acknowledge we HAVE trauma, but we also don't let it define us, we've done a lot of work, and it's not the foundation of our friendship. That moment was just the moment of ""Holy shit ...... this happens to other people? And they talk about it?"" 

He came to me one day with a question and asked ""Did I order this wrong, or did someone else? (He would give paper orders and we'd enter them in the client portals). Can you check and let me know? I'm just wondering.""

Someone else ordered it wrong and that someone was me. 

So I went to his office and said ""Hey, yeah ..... so that was me. I ordered it wrong.""

He just said ""Oh. Ok. I can use this result, but when you get some time can you call and ask if they have any of the sample left and if they can add this on?""

""Um..... sure. Ok.""

""Don't sweat it. Usually when a mistake gets made it's the process and not the person. This is fixable.""

""Ok.....""

""You don't know what to do with this, do you?""

""With what?""

""Me not yelling at you and being passive aggressively upset about something that's already done.""

"".....""

""Would it HELP if I yelled at you?""

""I mean yeah maybe ü•¥""

""You're gonna have a long wait. So here's what I suggest instead. There's coffee on, grab some and let's figure out how this happened. This isn't me against you. We're trying to get the correct test for the patient, right? That's something we both want?""

""Right.""

""Ok. So then it's us against the problem.""

And I was stunned for the rest of the day. 

He was totally right. I didn't know what to do with someone who accepted I made a mistake AND didn't see me as worthless as a result. Who wasn't even blaming me for it. Just went into ""Well it's already done, let's fix it"" mode. 

I didn't knkw what to do with GRACE and COMPASSION. 

And then as we became closer, the more he scared me. Because ""safe"" people have always turned out to ultimately be the worst ones. 

But to this very day 2 years later, he's still safe. He's not perfect. Far from it. He's moody sometimes when he gets burnt out or stressed, but it's never AT anyone. And it's not abusive. In fact he'll usually warn me. Like ""Hey I have had a WEEK. If I'm a little distant or short that's why. It's not you."" He's prone to anxiety in certain situations. 

But he's GOOD.

And he accepts me with my flaws and quirks - how I can get neurotic about some things, but I've also learned to ask HIM ""Hey, here's what's happening, here's why it's weighing on my mind, do you think this is reasonable or am I overthinking?"" If I might be ruminating he'll tell me. But he's also told me when he DOESN'T think I am, and will help me brainstorm ideas on how to solve or think about the issue. 

I'm used to just being told I'm dramatic, too sensitive, negative, complaining. Never ""Yeah I'd be upset too, that's valid. What do you want to do about it?"" 

I don't know what to DO with him sometimes because I know how to handle ABUSE. I don't know how to navigate HEALTHY sometimes. 

Even just having to do with myself. I mean, even when you're emotional or overthinking or anxious or overwhelmed.... I was never taught a way to handle that or reach out other than ""shut up"". So things would bottle til they blew. 

I think the healthy thing IS to say ""Yeah I know I can get neurotic sometimes.... can I get your perspective on this because I'm not sure about mine at the moment. I'm too close to it"". Or ""I'm really struggling. Are you free for a drink? I just want to be heard and if you have any suggestions I'd love them, but really I just want someone to give a shit""

Boundaries were another thing. I was always expected to respect everyone else's while mine didn't exist. My friend will set boundaries with me when needed. And I respect the HELL out of that, because it tells me he respects me, our friendship, AND himself. If I joke about something he's sensitive about he'll TELL ME. Instead of expecting me to read his mind and just know that topic is off limits, get silently resentful and disappear. He knows himself, and trusts me to have his interest at heart and not want to be the reason he feels upset or uncomfortable. He gives me the opportunity to SHOW him respect. And he affords me the same. I never have to tell him anything more than one time. He never makes me argue a boundary or preference. 

Everything revolved around Nmom. HER needs. HER problems which were all THE WORST THINGS EVER. Mine, even when they were serious, were drama and complaining. I never learned healthy ways to ask for support, and I never learned how to RECEIVE it. I was never taught that MY feelings were valid even if someone else would feel differently about a situation or an event. 

I was expected to respect EVERYTHING of hers when I couldn't even shut the bathroom door. If I ran out of toothpaste and used hers it was like I stole her life savings because that was HERS. She could speak to me any way she wanted but when I tossed it back I was a horrible, disrespectful, mouthy, ungrateful child and SHE WAS THE PARENT. 

I feel like just now, in middle age, I'm only first learning not only what a healthy relationship looks like, but how to HAVE one.

Geller did his best to maintain his composure. He had requested water, tea, and coffee from a staff aide. He was doing his best not to twitch at his desk or worse, see if he could steal a bottle of 1926 from the storage cabinet in the kitchen.¬†¬†

The Foreign staff had decided to convene in their conference room to draft plans for the coming war. Everything from securing aid from allies, perusing through the various documents concerning Hejiland from sales charters to international law to create a legal justification for the annexation, to failsafes should the whole plan go up in smoke. One of them was scanning a handful of reports from other departments on resources.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt have to worry about food prices, our agriculture sector can provide for us. We can also count on food reserves and United Contana‚Äôs food aid. Medicine is also sufficient thanks to public resources. Some may have to be diverted to the military -‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSo that leaves us with one key sector: energy.‚Äù Another aid interjected. The first one jerked his head up from the interjection, but nodded his head nonetheless. He colleague continued ‚ÄúOur coal mines are losing efficiency and its costing more every year to get the same output. Land based oil extraction isn‚Äôt nearly enough, the North coastline is too stormy to safely drill with our current technology, and all the accessible deposits in the Markian Sea are in Agnolian control. We need to look for foreign sources. Perhaps we consider more from Wehlen?‚Äù¬†¬†

The first one shook his head and closed his eyes to recall details ‚Äúthat will be more difficult than before. Ever since Smolak decided to be gung-ho about minorities in his borders, the AN has been able to draft a new wave of sanctions against direct purchasers of Wehzek oil. We could try workarounds by buying oil secondhand but the added cost of middlemen and the geographic boundaries make that risky. Lespia and possibly Pales could be convinced to interject any Wehzek shipments or any vessel suspected of carrying sanctioned goods under guise of AN charter.‚Äù¬†

The second man pondered for a moment ‚Äúwhat if we sought coal production to free up oil reserves for the military? Question is where can be get enough of it at the moment?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúClosest option there is Sordland, which is a double-edged sword. They‚Äôve tailored a strong international image since the civil war, even with all that business in the South. They have good coal reserves but so far Rayne has yet to make any outreach to either us or the Lespians. The Sords are also naturally wary of us ever since Conriat and the civil war general, what was his name Ryland?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúRykard‚Äù Geller corrected. His fixation on his pen and notepad might give the impression that he was listening to the conversation. However, the swirl of emotions left him waxing and waning in attention, a part of him looking for a vice or even a chance to shut his eyes till supper.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThank you, sir. We may need to add honey possible deal. There must be something we can offer to the Sords to make them willing to shake hands with communists.‚Äù he began flipping through various folders, looking for a clue.¬†

‚ÄúWhat if we offered a price increase of 15%? No strings attached, just a short 6-month contract to get the coal needed for the war. Sordland‚Äôs strapped for cash right now with their current economic woes.‚Äù his colleague offered¬†

‚ÄúThey might not go for it; they‚Äôll be push back among the isolationists but they see those money-grubbers more appealing than ‚Äúvile‚Äù communists‚Äù he highlighted his comment with acidity as if he was trying to digest the words.¬†¬†

‚ÄúBut they might be desperate enough to do so. We might also want to reach out to Xina, Rika, and United Contana for shipments. They might take longer but they‚Äôre safer.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not all. We need to work with the MoE to slowly transfer the economy to wartime.‚Äù Geller decided.¬†

‚ÄúBut sir, didn‚Äôt General Hersh say the campaign would only take a month? A war economy for such a conflict might be unecessary.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhen has the last time any war planned by a general staff gone exactly as expected‚Äù the withering look he gave could sour a glass of milk.¬†¬†

‚ÄúSend the plans over to the general staff so they know what they‚Äôve got‚Äù¬†

Valgish General Headquarters, same time¬†

The room was filled with officers from all branches discussing everything from manpower and logistics, to hypothetical responses to their actions by the enemy.¬†¬†

‚ÄúRoom attention!‚Äù an aide had yelled as Hersh walked into the room. ‚ÄúAt Ease‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúGentlemen, we have been entrusted with the vital task of seizing our lost island of Hejiland by military force. We must be swift, decisive, and devastating such that our name will be once more feared like our Imperial ancestors.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat are our options on the table?‚Äù He gestured to the strategic map of the Markian Sea. It detailed key cities, facilities, ports, islands, naval routes, and other key information for land, sea, and air campaigns in the region.¬†¬†

¬†

¬†

‚ÄúA few ones sir, some are better than others‚Äù one of his fleet commanders stepped forward. ‚ÄúThe key element is the quick seizure of Hejiland. Our main goal should be the city of Hejiport on the East side of the island. It‚Äôs the largest capital city and port. Getting there will be tricky however.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThe Agnolian rats have had it for almost three decades and they have made quite the effort to hold it. Our recon photos and spies indicate the strongest defenses are on the East side. The North and South coasts allow different approaches that have weaker fortifications. We can also deceive the enemy and divert attention by launching a pincer. The North approach is wider and allows for more maneuverability at sea but is much longer.¬†¬†

If we go from the South, it's a shorter distance but the Agnolians might detect our preparations sooner as a result. There‚Äôs also the issue that our Southern ports are not big enough to house all the fleet together. Wilburn has larger facilities, better logistics, and is located closer to our capital but is also much further away from Hejiland. Finally, if we choose to attack from the West our forces will have the shortest land distance to travel to Hejiport, but the time to travel will be the longest. We will likely face the heaviest naval resistance from Agnolia on the West and North coastlines.‚Äù¬†

Hersh took the time to carefully observe and weigh the risks, recalling his experience with that of his predecessors.¬†¬†

Speed, shock, fog, and friction are key elements here. They‚Äôve had 20 years to prepare for this moment, so we need to hit them with something they won‚Äôt expect. The East is off the table, as if it was ever a possibility. You‚Äôd be better off running into a minefield drunk.¬†¬†

He glanced to the west side of the island¬†

Too far away, we let those fish-heads dictate the flow of battle. The Markian Fleet would be overstretched, leaving us open for their planes and ships to pick us off. Logistics would be a nightmare.¬†

He then looked to the narrow parts of the North and South.¬†

Close enough to our lines they can be aided. The North gives more room to maneuver, more ships can get in there. But the South is closer to our ports. But they're not big enough.... a dual pincer perhaps?¬†

He shook his head mentally¬†

Nay, leave us divided and too complex. One beachhead is a nightmare, a second on the opposite end is just torturing yourself. They‚Äôll expect us from the South, so that leaves...¬†

Hersh then looked up to his staff.¬†

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the plan‚Äù he began and grabbed the handle of a map stick to indicate.¬†

‚ÄúWe attack from the North, premeditated by attacks from the South as a diversion. The South fleet will then swing west to protect our flank and support the North Front invasion southwards to Hejiland. Seize key locations and resupply with artificial harbors and aircraft.‚Äù¬†¬†

When he concluded, Hersh took the opportunity to survey the room. Many looked eager in agreement, others were deep in calculations and preparations, while others showed concern for the operation.¬†

‚ÄúI know you have many points to make, but for now I think we shall reconvene tomorrow after we‚Äôve debriefed our respective subordinates on the plan. Do not look frightful comrades, a new day is upon us: one from which our poor brothers and sisters shall be shackled no longer. Through broken chains!‚Äù¬†

The room echoed with such thunderous applause Hersh thought it could‚Äôve snapped a sea anchor chain.¬†

Every journey begins with a single step¬†

One with many more to follow.¬†¬†

In reading these posts the general consensus is either 1. food in the home is a free for all, or the expectation is that 2. nanny brings own meal normally but it‚Äôs within reason ok to eat snacks/beverages in the house. We want to go with #2.  I don‚Äôt mind her making coffee, tea, having bagels, cheese stick, hummus, coffee cake left out, etc etc etc BUT I don‚Äôt want her to *expect* to be provided a meal and thus not pack anything regularly. 

Please review the below and see if it seems fair:

For context nanny is explicitly not responsible for grocery shopping, meal prep (infant is 3mo). Contract is very nanny friendly otherwise and I‚Äôve used the Nanny Council template (GH 40hrs, paid vacation time at her choosing, stipend, guaranteed raise, inclement weather policy, transition time policy, minute late fee etc)


‚ÄúMeal Obligations: 

Provision of Meals and Food Storage

The Nanny agrees to provide her own meals during working hours. The Nanny may store her meals and snacks in the Family's designated areas (e.g., refrigerator or pantry) during her employment. However, the Nanny is welcome to use refrigerated or pantry staples/beverages/snacks available in the Family's house, up to Nanny‚Äôs discretion, unless otherwise communicated by Family The Family is not liable for any food items stored in their home.

Due to household allergies, Nanny is encouraged to bring food that is peanut-free.‚Äù

I wanted to share a little story that warmed my heart recently and reminded me of the incredible power of community.

A few weeks ago, I decided to take a solo trip to a nearby town. I was feeling a bit down, and I thought a change of scenery might help. As I explored the quaint streets, I stumbled upon a small caf√©. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and baked goods drew me in.

I ordered a latte and took a seat by the window, enjoying the lively chatter around me. Suddenly, I overheard a conversation at the next table. A woman was sharing her struggles with starting her own business. I could sense her passion but also her fears.

Feeling inspired, I decided to introduce myself. We struck up a conversation, and I shared some tips from my own experiences. What started as a casual chat turned into an impromptu brainstorming session. Other patrons chimed in with their ideas and encouragement. It was beautiful to see a room full of strangers come together to uplift one person.

By the end of the hour, not only had she gained new insights, but I also left feeling more connected than ever. It reminded me that even in our busy lives, small moments of kindness can create a ripple effect.

So, here‚Äôs to the unexpected gifts of community! Have you ever experienced a moment where strangers became friends? I‚Äôd love to hear your stories!",1,1729959512.0,CasualConversation,0,1.0,False

OH AND I LIVE IN GERMANY ","
AYEEE welcome to .. my post? To my life story? Idk welcome to‚Ä¶ ME! i know i know, so far it doesn't sound that exciting and more like that one strange uncle you see once a year during family events, that just keeps rambeling about aliens, the goverment, and how pigeons are goverment drones, but keep reading and you might just discover I'm actually your great uncle which went missing 10 years ago. (Or i can play him for 50‚Ç¨ only cash or bitcoin accepted.)

Either way I have heard from some very trustable sources on this subreddit that I should write down some of my hobbies as that's apparently what people do which are considered ""normal"", now im not the biggest fan of just writing everything about me down cause well THIS POST WOULD BECOME A BOOK,(best seller Material? Perhaps, bin Material... Perhaps)

But ill throw some of the basics in there: I love photography, i love filmmaking, nature(taking walks in it and just exploring and propably tripping and breaking my ankle because i have the stability of that one grandparent you thought would really be done after that last stair fall) watching youtube and netflix ,playing games, talking to new people aaand traveling, not because i'm wanted by multiple countries their secret services for a variety of crimes, including but not limited to the ilegal smuggeling of koalas, becvause thats not something id do, which is why im not wanted, really, trust me:)

I don't care about your gender or country but because of timezones i preffer it if your european (Not a must at all though BECAUSE I DO WORK THE NIGHTSHIFT WHICH MEANS MY SCHEDULE IS ALL OVER THE FLOOR) Overall I'm just a social fucking weirdo who always is looking for more people to talk to (NO I AM NOT ADDICTED...SORT OF) oh and German people especially RISE UP, I NEED Y'ALL TO PRACTICE MY GERMAN.

You don‚Äôt have to be a social expert at all, its more then okay if your a bit shy as long as your just actually interested in talking and not as dry as the ground in most of the world will be in a few more years (GOD DONT WE LOVE CLIMATE CHANGE ? I MISS SNOW DURING CHRISTMAS, I CANT BE THE ONLY ONE??) and even tho i love to fuck around and just have fun im also Always here for you if there is heavier stuff on your mind (i‚Äôm quite a good listner and Always try to help) .

I love bringing laughter into people their lives but ill also be your totally not certified in any way therapist(I WILL EVEN GIVE YOU SKITTLES AND CALL THEM SPECIAL ANTI DEPRESSANTS, LIKE EXCLUSIVE SHIT, HELL ILL EVEN TAKE YOUR HEALTHINSURANCE)

If id describe myself i‚Äôd say i‚Äôm.. Quite energetic, Always up for fun stuff and exploring, kind of shy at the start, caring, and hmmm. Fuck I CAN‚ÄôT BE THE ONLY ONE WHO ALWAYS STRUGGLES TO DESCRIBE THEMSELVES RIGHT? Like I honestly find it diffecult xd. Like I'm the fucker that googles""personality traits"" and see what i relate with like some fucking quirky hippy in a coffee shop at 11am after taking too many shrooms the night beefore.

I‚Äôm on discord, insta, whatsapp, snap, pigeon mail carier service and dolphine communication.

Hi all,

I am planning to buy my first real coffee machine + grinder setup for daily use in the upcoming weeks with a budget of approx EUR 750, for the following purposes:
- home use, 2 persons, back2back shots 
- I myself like creamy espressos, missus is more of a capppucino/latte macchiato lover
- mainly lighter roasts and speciality coffee, but options are quite versatile

My original idea was a Sage (Breville) Barista Express. However, following my research, it seems that a Df54 + a Bambino Plus is a better setup all in all.

Any other recommendations/opinions?

I recently got diagnosed with schiz0phrenia and bipolar disorder last month. My psych put me on 250mg of Vaproic acid and 2mg of Risperidone. Life was great, I was so productive and the best version of myself (ONLY while downing copious amounts of energy drinks and coffee). Then a couple weeks later my voices were coming back before half the day was over. I discussed this and she upped the dosage to 500mg Vaproic acid and 3mg risperidone. A week later (October 9th this month) I had one of the worst depressive episodes I'd had in years. I did not know it was the medication yet. I would just cry and cry. Serious depression out of nowhere. 

This continued till Oct. 17 this month when I finally quit it cold turkey and have only been taking the Risperidone (3mg daily) for my voices. The problem is that even since completely stopping it the depression is not going away. I'm making this post because today it got too much. I felt like I couldn't breathe and started beating my chest. Cried like a baby. Then I was normal but very anxious. Psych wants to put me on Sertraline 50mg but I'm hesitant because I haven't been depressed for YEARS. I'm a very cheerful and optimistic person generally but these past few weeks I've just been depressed, can't do ANYTHING because no motivation, cannot even cook for myself anymore. I'm so depressed I can't move.I just rot at home watching netflix. How long until the Valproic acid/Sodium valproate completely leaves my system? Do I need to quit Risperidone as well? I just want to be normal again like I was before I started my medication. These withdrawals are among one of the most horrible I've ever experienced.

I‚Äôm big on diving into random topics like why coffee tastes better in certain mugs or why dogs look guilty even when they‚Äôre probably just confused.

What am I hoping to find? Just someone who:

1. Enjoys a laid-back conversation where there‚Äôs no rush to be profound‚Äîthough it‚Äôs totally cool if we stumble into some unexpectedly deep moments.
2. Appreciates the little things in life, like the satisfaction of a perfectly melted grilled cheese or a well-timed 80s rock ballad.
3. Doesn‚Äôt mind chatting about the daily grind but also enjoys wandering into fun hypotheticals like ‚ÄúWhat would you do if you woke up as a cat for a day?‚Äù
4. Has their own hobbies, interests, or life lessons they wouldn‚Äôt mind sharing. I‚Äôm always up for hearing about new books, wild stories, or even a random fact you learned that day.

If this sounds like your kind of conversation, I‚Äôd love to connect and get to know each other. Who knows, maybe we‚Äôll end up with some shared laughs, new music recommendations, or the answer to life‚Äôs small mysteries.
