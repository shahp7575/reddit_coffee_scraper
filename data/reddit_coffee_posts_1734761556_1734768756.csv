-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Finding the right medication for your furry friend can sometimes feel like navigating a maze blindfolded. You're worried, they're uncomfortable, and you just want a solution. Well, if you're searching for tacrolimus eye drops for your dog, you've come to the right place. This article will shed light on the process, breaking down everything from prescription requirements to reputable sources and alternative considerations. We'll dive deep into the ""where to buy tacrolimus eye drops for dogs"" question, exploring the nuances and providing actionable advice. So, grab a cup of coffee, settle in, and let’s unravel this together.

### Understanding the Importance of a Vet's Prescription

Before we jump into the ""where to buy tacrolimus eye drops for dogs"" discussion, let’s address the elephant in the room: prescriptions. Why are they so important? Well, imagine trying to bake a cake without a recipe. You might end up with something edible, but it probably won’t be what you envisioned. The same principle applies to medications. A veterinarian's prescription is that essential recipe, tailored specifically to your dog's needs. It considers their breed, age, weight, overall health, and the specific condition being treated. Administering medication without a proper diagnosis and prescribed dosage can be risky, potentially causing adverse reactions or even exacerbating the existing problem. So, first things first – a visit to the vet is crucial.

### Where to Buy Tacrolimus Eye Drops for Dogs: Exploring Your Options

Alright, now that we’ve established the importance of a prescription, let’s tackle the main question: Where can you actually get these drops?

1. **Your Veterinarian's Office:** Often, the most straightforward option is purchasing the medication directly from your vet’s office. This offers the convenience of having it readily available right after your appointment. Plus, you can ask any lingering questions you might have, and be assured of the medication's authenticity.
2. **Licensed Online Pharmacies:** In today’s digital age, online pharmacies have become a popular choice for pet medications. However, it’s crucial to ensure the pharmacy is legitimate and requires a valid prescription. Look for accreditation from organizations like the PharmacyChecker Verification Program, and be wary of websites offering suspiciously low prices or no prescription requirements. Remember, a deal that looks too good to be true often is.
3. **Local Pharmacies (Human or Veterinary):** While some human pharmacies may carry tacrolimus, it's more likely you’ll find it at a specialized veterinary pharmacy. A quick call to your local pharmacies can confirm their stock and any specific requirements.

### Decoding the Jargon: Tacrolimus, Immunosuppressants, and KCS

Navigating the world of veterinary medicine can feel like learning a new language. Let’s break down some key terms:

- **Tacrolimus:** This medication works by suppressing the immune system’s inflammatory response, making it useful for conditions like dry eye (Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca or KCS) and other inflammatory eye diseases.
- **Immunosuppressants:** As the name suggests, these medications dampen the immune system's activity. This can be beneficial in managing autoimmune disorders or preventing organ rejection, but it also comes with the need for careful monitoring.
- **KCS (Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca):** Commonly known as dry eye, this condition occurs when the eyes don’t produce enough tears. This can lead to discomfort, irritation, and even corneal damage. Tacrolimus can help stimulate tear production.

### Alternatives and Complementary Therapies: Exploring Other Avenues

While tacrolimus is often effective, exploring alternative and complementary therapies can be beneficial, especially for managing dry eye. These can include:

- **Artificial Tears:** These over-the-counter lubricants provide temporary relief from dryness and irritation.
- **Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplements:** These can have anti-inflammatory properties and may support tear production.
- **Cyclosporine:** Another immunosuppressant frequently used to treat KCS, often prescribed under the brand name Optimmune.

### Where to Buy Tacrolimus Eye Drops for Dogs: Avoiding Pitfalls and Scams

Sadly, the online world isn’t always a safe space. When searching for ""where to buy tacrolimus eye drops for dogs,"" be wary of:

- **Websites Selling Without Prescriptions:** This is a huge red flag. Legitimate pharmacies will always require a valid prescription from a veterinarian.
- **Unrealistic Prices:** If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Counterfeit medications are a real concern, and they can harm your pet.
- **Unsecured Websites:** Look for ""https"" in the website address and a padlock icon in the address bar, indicating a secure connection.

### The Importance of Proper Storage and Administration

Imagine baking that perfect cake only to leave it out in the sun. It wouldn't be very enjoyable, would it? Similarly, proper storage of tacrolimus eye drops is essential to maintain their effectiveness. Follow your veterinarian's instructions carefully, and always keep the medication stored as directed. Proper administration is equally important. Getting the drops into your dog's eyes might require a bit of patience and practice. Your vet can demonstrate the best technique, making the process less stressful for both you and your furry friend.

### Where to Buy Tacrolimus Eye Drops for Dogs: Making an Informed Decision

So, where does that leave us? Finding tacrolimus eye drops for your dog requires careful consideration. A vet’s prescription is non-negotiable, and sourcing the medication from reputable sources is paramount. Whether you choose your vet's office, an online pharmacy, or a local pharmacy, remember to prioritize safety, legitimacy, and your dog's well-being. Don’t hesitate to ask questions, and always double-check information. After all, you’re your dog's best advocate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many people seek a brighter smile through teeth whitening treatments, hoping to ditch stains and unveil pearly whites. However, a common concern that arises post-treatment is the appearance of white patches on teeth. It's important to understand what causes these patches and how to address them effectively.

### What Causes White Patches on Teeth?

White patches, also known as enamel hypoplasia or demineralization, can occur for a few reasons after teeth whitening. Here’s a breakdown:

- **Improper Technique:** Overusing whitening products or applying them incorrectly can lead to uneven results and spots.
- **Underlying Dental Issues:** Existing enamel damage or decay can be exacerbated by whitening agents, making underlying issues more visible.
- **Acidic Foods and Beverages:** Consuming acidic items after whitening can further demineralize already compromised enamel, leading to white patches.
- **Hydration Levels:** Dehydrated teeth are more prone to experiencing white spots, especially following whitening treatments.

### How to Prevent White Patches

While it’s natural to desire whiter teeth, preventing white patches is crucial. Here are practical steps you can take:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Consult a Professional:** Always seek guidance from a dentist before starting any whitening treatment. They can offer personalized advice based on your dental health.
- **Choose Quality Products:** Invest in reputable whitening products that are known for safety and effectiveness. Avoid those on the market that promise instant results.
- **Follow Instructions:** Pay close attention to the guidelines provided with your whitening kit. Adhering to recommended durations and frequencies can minimize risks.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking water helps maintain enamel health. Hydrated teeth are less likely to develop white patches.

### Treating White Patches on Teeth

If you already have white patches after whitening your teeth, don't panic. Here are some solutions to consider:

- **Fluoride Treatments:** Using fluoride toothpaste or fluoride varnish can help remineralize your enamel. This might aid in restoring the natural color of your teeth.
- **Desensitizing Toothpaste:** If you experience sensitivity, switching to a desensitizing toothpaste can alleviate discomfort and help reduce patchiness.
- **Veneers or Bonding:** In cases where white patches are severe, consulting a cosmetic dentist about veneers or bonding can be a long-term solution for restoring tooth appearance.
- **Observe Oral Hygiene:** Maintain a regular brushing and flossing routine to prevent further damage. Good oral hygiene promotes overall tooth health, which can help avoid patch development.

### When to Visit a Dentist

It's important to monitor the condition of your teeth after undergoing whitening. If you notice persistent white patches or if they are accompanied by pain or sensitivity, it’s time to consult your dentist. They can perform a thorough examination to determine the cause and suggest tailored treatments.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
While white patches on teeth after whitening treatments can be concerning, understanding their causes, prevention strategies, and treatment options can empower you to maintain a beautiful smile. Prioritizing your dental health and following professional guidance can lead to a successful whitening experience without undesirable effects.

Your smile is important, so take care of it! With the right knowledge and practices, you can enjoy a radiant smile free from white patches.

Tips for Maintaining a Bright Smile After Whitening Treatments
--------------------------------------------------------------

Whitening treatments can work wonders for your smile, making it appear brighter and more youthful. However, maintaining that brightness can be just as important as the treatment itself. After you’ve invested time and money into achieving a dazzling smile, caring for it becomes essential. Here are some practical tips to help you maintain your bright smile post-whitening.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Practice Good Oral Hygiene

To keep your teeth shining, start with good oral hygiene. Brush your teeth at least twice a day using a fluoride toothpaste. Consider the following:

- **Choose a Soft-Bristled Toothbrush:** This can help clean your teeth without causing damage to the enamel.
- **Don't Forget to Floss:** Flossing removes plaque and food particles stuck between your teeth, which can help keep your smile brighter.
- **Consider a Whitening Toothpaste:** This can add an extra polishing effect and help maintain the brightness of your smile between treatments.

### Avoid Staining Foods and Beverages

After whitening treatments, your teeth can be more susceptible to stains. Hence, it’s wise to limit consumption of certain foods and drinks that may cause discoloration:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Coffee and Tea:** The dark pigments in these beverages can cling to your teeth.
- **Red Wine:** Known for its staining properties, red wine can significantly alter the shade of your teeth.
- **Certain Berries:** Blueberries and blackberries are delicious but can leave behind stains.
- **Colas and Sodas:** These drinks not only contain sugar but also coloring that can affect tooth color.

### Stay Hydrated

Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Staying hydrated helps wash away food particles and bacteria, reducing your tooth's chance of becoming stained. Plus, water can help maintain saliva production, which serves to protect your enamel and keep your mouth healthy.

### Regular Dental Check-Ups

Don't underestimate the importance of regular dental visits. Professional cleanings can remove plaque and tartar that may cause your smile to lose its shine. Moreover, your dentist can provide personalized advice on maintaining your teeth after whitening. Schedule your check-up at least twice a year.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Use a Straw for Beverages

When you do enjoy those dark-colored beverages, consider using a straw. This simple tip can minimize contact between staining drinks and your teeth. While it might seem trivial, it can make a noticeable difference.

### Consider Touch-Up Treatments

If you notice your smile fading, don’t hesitate to conduct at-home whitening treatments. You can use whitening strips or gels designed for at-home use. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully to avoid any potential damage to your enamel.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Watch the Frequency of Treatments

While it’s tempting to want to keep your teeth white constantly, too much whitening can cause sensitivity or damage. Always take breaks between treatments to allow your teeth to recover. Consult with your dentist to determine the right schedule for you.

### Be Mindful of Your Oral Habits

Throughout your day, be conscious of habits that could lead to discoloration:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Avoid Tobacco:** Smoking or chewing tobacco not only stains teeth but also harms your gums and overall oral health.
- **Limit Acidic Foods:** Foods high in acidity can erode enamel, making teeth more susceptible to stains.

### Choose the Right Mouthwash

Some mouthwashes are formulated specifically for stain removal. Select an alcohol-free mouthwash that helps fight plaque and keep your teeth bright without further harming your enamel.

By following these tips, you can significantly enhance the longevity of your bright smile after whitening treatments. With consistent care, you can ensure that your dazzling smile remains vibrant and healthy for a long time. Remember, maintaining your bright smile is an ongoing commitment that will ultimately pay off in confidence and aesthetic appeal.

### Conclusion

Experiencing white patches on teeth after whitening can be concerning, but understanding the underlying causes helps to address the issue effectively. These patches often arise from factors like dehydration of the enamel, uneven application of whitening agents, or existing dental conditions. Taking steps to identify the cause of these white patches can guide you toward the right solution, whether it involves seeking professional dental advice or reconsidering your whitening methods at home.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
To prevent and manage these patches, it is essential to maintain proper oral hygiene practices and follow post-whitening care guidelines diligently. Drinking plenty of water can help rehydrate your enamel, while avoiding acidic or staining foods right after a treatment can protect your newly whitened smile. Regular dental check-ups and using fluoride toothpaste can also work wonders in maintaining your bright, beautiful teeth.

Remember, whitening is just one part of your oral care journey. By integrating healthy habits, like staying hydrated and using the right dental products, you can keep your smile shining bright. Should any patches persist, do not hesitate to consult your dentist. They can provide personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific needs, ensuring that your smile remains healthy and vibrant for years to come.

","I'm ancient. Just hit 30 in the last week. When nature calls, dust and clay answers.

I made a post here a few months ago, about how my CEO took me out, boozed me up, and made pretty promises. I waited until the merger was done: he promised me a role in analytics. I waited a month more. He said there was no such role.

I decided to apply for Law School. O' man-flesh, the hours are long- I know. I worked, initially, as a Loss Adjuster for one of the big three Loss Adjusting companies. 12-16 hour days aren't alien to me.

But I broached this talk with the CEO and he said I should go for it. The company will pay.

Admittedly, this is all I've ever wanted to do. I've studied software engineering in game design, hated it. I've spent nearly a decade in Insurance. I've done customer service, claims, loss adjustment, broking, and even bought coffees for the team a few times.

But here's the thing: I'm **nervous**. I live in a small country. A degree in Law is one thing. An applicable degree in Law is another. I want a role that is high-paying. The business has no requirements for me other than the fact I must continue to work part-time throughout my degree. They're not expecting me to work in-house afterwards, they're not expecting me to do anything but to continue doing what I'm doing.

But I want to earn some big money. Hey, we all do. But, I have the chance and capabilities now to do so, now. Corporate Law is my drug of choice. What does this look like? How can I prepare?

I'd love to hear from those that have transitioned to such roles. If possible, I'd love to hear from any experienced C-suite legends to guide me in how I should tackle my future.

I F21 years old I'm currently in my gap year due to my mental health and stress. Almost every week I have arguments with my mother but it's starting to get really bad to the point I don't wanna live at home anymore.

 It could be small arguments but also big arguments. My mom always says that I am very lazy and don't help with household chores. I must say it's kinda true but to be honest I am right now really depressed and it just takes for me a lot of strength to do those household chores but I still try to do it like yesterday (I just felt really awful and guilty) I did laundry and folded the clean clothes ( I know that it is not much). But my mom still says that I'm very lazy and don't help her. 


While my brother 24 years old (most of the time at home) doesn't help and just plays games in his room but that's fine according to my mom because he is a man and shouldn't do anything around the house. My mom does everything for my brother fold his clothes put it in his closet, makes plates with food for him and is very gentle with him and let him sleep in till when ever he wants. But with me she is the very opposite I need to help because I am a woman and it's my responsibility and duty to do those things and to cook. Whenever I ask my mom if she can make me something she says no because your a woman and should do that yourself and I should be ashamed that I'm even asking her to do that while whenever my brother ask than she quickly stand up to make it for him. 

According to my mom I also can't sleep in or she wakes me up because a daughter should wake up early I had so many arguments with my mother about this but she always says that I'm very ungrateful child and that I should talk less and just do chores around the house and cook. 

During the arguments she always says that I resemble my dad a lot but in a bad way. She also blames me for every small mistake like yesterday she accidentally spilled her coffee and blamed me for it while I didn't do anything. She often does this but idk why. She also compares me a lot with other people and always says that I didn't had achieve something. I must say i don't have achieved a lot but last july i got my degree and asked my mom if she was happy but she wasn't. That hurted me so much. There is more but it's just to long to write. To be honest I'm really starting to dislike my own mother. It just seems like she doesn't like me. To be honest It's making my mental health and stress worse. I just wanna be comfortable and safe at home. Maybe I am just overreacting and being dramatic. Idk anymore.

I’m relocating to North Carolina and need advice on where to plant some roots. My job has me regularly traveling to Weaverville, Boone, Newton, Newland, Morganton, Marion, Lenoir, Burnsville, Asheville, and Hickory.

Hickory has been suggested as a good option, but I’d love to hear what you think. Coming from Los Angeles, I’m looking for that sweet spot between metropolitan vibes and suburban charm. Bonus points for access to great doctors and hospitals, an airport for occasional escapes, diverse ethnic restaurants, Pilates studios, coffee shops, and a solid doggy daycare for my pup.

I’d prefer to rent a modern luxury apartment because, let’s face it, a comfy home base makes all the commuting more bearable. I know my territory is big, and I’m no stranger to long drives, but the goal is to make life as convenient (and enjoyable!) as possible.

So, hit me with your recommendations for cities or neighborhoods that check these boxes and make commuting manageable. Thanks in advance, I’m beyond excited to make North Carolina my new home! ",0,1734766140.0,NorthCarolina,0,0.5,False

Did I mess this up?","TLDR: Met someone special while traveling, things went exceedingly well, I may have come across as a bit too clingy, and now not hearing from her.  
  
  
Hey everyone, I would appreciate some advice.

I was traveling and met this wonderful girl exactly 1 month ago at an event. She is very beautiful, sweet, and intelligent. We chatted and agreed to meet up for coffee the next day. Things were getting a little more serious as we went on a few more dates over 2 weeks, and we realized the connection we were forming and the attraction we had for each other. Our professions complemented each other perfectly. I am very ambitious and working on side projects, and she is similarly ambitious as well, and we were interested in working with each other too. I was a little slow to make the first move and kiss her after like our 3rd date, but I think she liked that.

I was only in town for 3 weeks, so the situation was a little rushed. We did get to go out for about 5 real dates and hung seen each other about 8 times total during this time. She agreed that it had been awhile since she experienced a connection like we were having, and she was open to exploring a relationship with me in the future, but she did not want to rush things. I agreed that I did not want to rush things, but I think she knew I was really falling for her. We did a few fun things around town together, shared some sweet moments together, and just overall had a perfect time.

When I left town, she agreed to stay in touch. She said she would make the distance easy. We planned a lot of fun dates for next time I hopefully get to visit in January (1-2 months away). She said she was not afraid of the distance and tried to reassure me that we could make it work. After I arrived back home, we did stay in constant communication and we expressed we felt very lucky to meet each other at the event. She was very warm to me, did not ever leave me on read and always texted at least a few times a day. We were even planning a spontaneous trip somewhere so we could fly and meet in the middle somewhere, but due to the busy holiday schedule she wasn't sure if she could fit it in.

After about a week of me being home and still talking with her every day, she mentioned that it might be until the end of January until she could lock in plans to see me, due to the busy December holidays. She said she was still open for the idea of trying to fit in a spontaneous trip, but it would have to be spontaneous and she couldn't say for certain.

Here's where my fuckup happens. I texted her ""I think I will miss you too much to wait until the end of January"". She sent me a few reassuring messages and said that she really wants to see me but can not move around her holiday schedule for me. I texted her back this 2 paragraph message saying I miss her and wish I could see her again and hold her hands, and told her that I understand and I'm not trying to pressure her, I just really miss her. She ends up texted me back and saying I was being a little intense right now, and asking what I expected from this when I left? I told her it would be nice to see her in like 3-6 weeks and we were getting closer to see if we were compatible. Her tone changed and she said that's unrealistic and nobody in long distance relationships sees each other that often. She ended up sending several similar texts trying to get her point across, and all I really ever said was ""What's going on right now? I don't understand"". Nothing got too severe, but she stated she was interested in the idea of a relationship with me, but she doesn't want to rush anything.

Up until this point, we had never had a negative interaction together, and I was honestly considering if this woman was perfect for me. It was like a perfect story. I was kind of falling in love with her, and I thought she felt the same way too, maybe just at a slightly slower pace.

The next day after our misunderstanding, I tried to text a few times and call her once, but she didn't answer. She ended up texting me a longer message later that night and said she was not trying to ignore me, but she needs space and wants to let things cool down. I texted her the next day and tried to explain that I feel like this is a misunderstanding and I was just trying to send a sweet message and tell her I miss her. She said she feels like I'm trying to resolve a situation that doesn't need to be resolved, and she really wanted to let things cool down. She said she was open to the idea of a relationship with me, but not there yet.

I think she may misunderstood my intentions when I said I that I missed her, and also when I said I wanted to see her in 3-6 weeks. I was just planning to visit her city often when possible for work purposes too. I also realize my texts may have come across as if I was trying to pressure her to cancel plans or something to see me, but that is 100% not what my intentions were, and somehow I think I failed in communicating that part. If anything, I was hoping I could make a quick trip to her city, and I wouldn't want her try to cancel her plans to visit me even if she suggested it.

I tried texted the next day to see how her day went, she texted back and explained a few things from her busy day. I texted back and told her a few things about my day, and she read it but didn't answer. I sent a few more texts about random subjects and she didn't even read them. So I quit texting her, but all my last messages were positive just asking about her day.

It's been 4 days since she last texted. I'm not sure how to proceed with the situation. She's asking for space so I'll give that to her. I don't understand how she could go off and need space, without ever getting to talk to me first or have a quick call to explain things. I feel like it was all a misunderstanding starting from me saying I will miss her, and she took my sweet message too intensely and it scared her off? We had previously shared our feelings with each other and I thought she took it quite well, she knows I am sweet but sensitive sometimes. I'm not sure if she took my message as some sort of ultimatum or something, but I'm surprised she did not give me a chance to explain more, before distancing herself.

I'm just hoping to give it time and it will all blow over, but it's harder with the distance. I don't know if I will get to see her again. Did I mess this up? She is very stable, calm, and sweet. I genuinely thought we formed a connection during our short time, and I'm a little hurt to not hear from her after a few days. But she is very mature, so I don't know if the need for space is normal. Do you think she will respond? Can I do anything at this point - feeling like my best option is just wait until she reaches out to me again.",2,1734765970.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

1hj4rte,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/1hj4rte/communication_spell_exploded_into_flames/,Communication spell exploded into flames,"So today (12/21) my target blocked me on everything after an argument we had. I don’t know if this necessarily matters but Ill add the back story and you can skip it if you want: 

he had essentially been getting with girls behind my back and I found out about it through his roommate. He asked to see me one last time and I agreed. He left on me on delivered for a while and I got annoyed and said “if you’re not gonna see me today i’ll just go see someone else”. he told me he was having dinner with his family and an hour later when I didn’t reply—blocked me. 

So now comes the spell. It was a simple communication spell I altered. Blue candle with both our names carved into it as well as the phrase “communication”. I wrote “love” and “communication” on bay leaves and wrapped it around the candle using red string. I also used some rose water, orange juice, cloves, poppy seeds, sugar, salt, cinnamon sticks, cinnamon, coffee beans, and lavender oil. I also wrote exactly what I wanted to happen on a piece of paper and cut in half toward me before burning it and sprinkling it on the candle and in the tin. Finally I wrote my petition.

When I first burnt the wick, I burnt my petition over it and it turned completely to ash before sprinkling into the tin. Then, the entire bottom of the tin caught fire. Like almost exploded into flames. The candle fell over and I had to quickly toss it into the tin where it was consumed by the fire. The full length candle completely burnt down in 3 minutes.

For over an hour as I’m writing this now, my petition (which mind you had been burnt to complete ash) has been on fire. Only five minutes ago when I went to check the status of the flame, the entire contents of the tin had also caught on fire. MIND YOU everything was soaked in water based oils. 

What the hell does this mean. Update as I reread over this for typos: it’s actually exploding with MY ROOM CAUGHT ON FUCKING FIRE HOLY SHIT

I put it out but holy shit it didnt do much damage but what in the actual fuck someone please tell me what the hell that meant

I know my ingredients there was absolutely nothing flammable enough to cause something like this. I know fire safety, my stupid ass just looked away to type for one second.

1hj4r1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hj4r1x/why_does_my_ex_31m_push_to_remain_friends_with_me/,Why does my ex (31m) push to remain friends with me? (31f),"My ex (31m). broke up with me (31f) 6 weeks ago after 18 months together. I moved out 2 weeks ago. He said he lost romantic feelings for me and his mental health went into decline, since then he's acted erratic, cruel and cold towards me, shutting down, flipping back to caring, kind and open to communication. 

In all honesty, he had caregivers burnout. I had a complex botched surgery in January that was covered up by the hospital and he ended up caring for me for many months, after losing his late wife 3 years ago and also caring for her. With the legal case for the surgery, my transition into living with chronic pain, an early miscarriage from us not being careful, his late wife's anniversary, I think he hit a mental breaking point. It hurts that he never communicated this, and instead continued to fake the relationship longer, making future plans with me, asking me to move in and go on the lease, eventually move to the coast with me, travel together and saying he wanted kids with me etc. I'm not pinning after him, he did a lot of damage in the breakup and was cruel at times, so although I miss him and the person he was, and am sad that our chapter is over - I need to heal from the chaos and have some peace in my life again. 

He is currently working with a therapist and has decided he needs to focus on his mental health. I agree, he has way to much unresolved trauma/issues to be the person I need in my life right now. He's been pushing to stay friends in the breakup, wanting to hang out, play video games together, go do activities and treats me like a girlfriend (no physical stuff)!when we are together, downloading my favorite games, adding movies to our old watch list. I said early on I wouldn't accept this, I was happy to see how things went between us (if there was an opportunity for reconciliation) and but was happy to be amicable with him to navigate the breakup and part ways. He'd then switch to being open to reconciliation/seeing how things go, back to only being friends. 

This week, he bailed on helping me move and go to hospital procedure as he felt I was using him by getting him to help me with things (moving out/appointments he agreed to take me to still after the breakup as I have mobility issues) and discarding him afterwards and by wanting to remain friends. We had a big argument. Yesterday, he came over to clear the air. I explained I needed to heal/break the emotional connection I have with him, which is why I want to put space in between us, and he looked visibly upset that I wouldn't be happy to spend time together still. 

I'm struggling to understand why someone who ended things with you, wants to focus on their mental health would be upset that after an immediate breakup you don't want to be friends? I've been the dumper before in past relationships and never pushed this. I have exes who are friends, or aquitances I still occasionally speak to/grab a coffee with/chat with online but this took many months/years to establish. Why push so soon after ending things to keep someone in your life? ",1,1734765571.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False
1hj4qfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiFragranceAddicts/comments/1hj4qfa/20_perfumery_knowledge_here/,20% Perfumery Knowledge Here,"# 1. The Key 20% of Perfumery Knowledge

# A. Fragrance Families

Fragrances are grouped into families based on their dominant scent characteristics. Learning these helps identify and classify perfumes efficiently. The main families are:

* **Floral**: Rose, jasmine, lily (e.g., Latafa Khamra for its warm floral tones).
* **Woody**: Sandalwood, cedarwood (e.g., Latafa Asad for its amber-woody vibe).
* **Oriental**: Spicy, resinous notes like vanilla and amber (e.g., Afnan 9PM for its warm gourmand profile).
* **Fresh**: Citrus, aquatic, or green notes (e.g., Versace Dylan Blue’s aquatic freshness).

**Tip**: Start with samples from each family to understand your preferences.

# B. The Structure of Perfumes (Pyramid Model)

* **Top Notes**: First impression (e.g., citrus or lavender).
* **Middle/Heart Notes**: Core identity (e.g., floral or spicy tones).
* **Base Notes**: Long-lasting foundation (e.g., amber, vanilla, or musk).

**Tip**: Smell a perfume after 5 minutes, 30 minutes, and 3 hours to identify these layers.

# C. The Importance of Key Ingredients

Certain ingredients are cornerstones in perfumery:

* **Fixatives** like musk or amber make fragrances last longer.
* **Accords**, like “rose-oud” or “citrus-aromatic,” are blends that define a perfume’s character.

**Tip**: Study a few versatile ingredients like rose, sandalwood, and patchouli to understand their uses.

# D. Concentration Levels

Understand how concentration impacts strength and longevity:

* **Perfume Extract (Extrait de Parfum)**: 20–30% fragrance oil.
* **Eau de Parfum (EDP)**: 15–20% fragrance oil.
* **Eau de Toilette (EDT)**: 5–15% fragrance oil.

**Tip**: Match concentration to your usage needs (e.g., EDP for evenings, EDT for casual wear).

# E. Layering and Longevity Techniques

* **Layering**: Combine complementary scents (e.g., woody base with a fresh floral top) for unique profiles.
* **Application**: Apply on pulse points (e.g., wrists, neck) for better diffusion.

**Tip**: Moisturize your skin before applying perfume to enhance longevity.



# 2. Practical Applications

# A. Choosing a Signature Scent

1. Test perfumes on your skin, not just strips, to see how they interact with your body chemistry.
2. Shortlist based on occasions and preferences (e.g., rose-based for romantic settings, citrus for daily wear).

# B. Identifying Quality

High-quality perfumes have:

* Natural or well-blended synthetic ingredients.
* Smooth transitions between notes without harshness.

**Tip**: Compare niche perfumes to designer fragrances to spot differences.

# 3. Tools and Techniques

* **Perfume Testing**: Use blotters or skin for genuine results. Avoid coffee beans (a myth) and opt for a neutral area to reset your nose.
* **Perfume Wardrobe**: Build a collection by purpose (e.g., work, evening, summer).
* **Learning Resources**: Use platforms like **Fragrantica** or **Basenotes** to research fragrances and reviews.

# 4. Actionable Tips

* Visit perfume stores regularly to train your nose.
* Keep a notebook to track what you like/dislike and why.
* Experiment with layering perfumes you own to create a personalized scent.
* Watch for seasonal trends in perfumery to expand your knowledge.

**Example of Layering:**

Layer **Latafa Khamra** (gourmand, warm) with a light rose perfume. The result? A rich yet balanced fragrance perfect for evening occasions.",14,1734765498.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,1,1.0,False
1hj4por,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1hj4por/first_japan_trip_what_i_wish_i_knew_f_solo/,First Japan Trip What I Wish I Knew (F Solo Traveler) ,"Hey all, currently finishing up 3 weeks in Japan as a 26 F solo traveler who speaks intermediate Japanese. 

Wanted to write down what i wish I knew after hundreds of hours of research for the trip! 

I’ll start off with the most controversial.

1: I did not find Shinjuku safe as a solo traveler. Keep in mind, my home town in the states is a pretty rough city and I was shocked by how I found Shinjuku. Obviously I knew to be careful of drink spiking, stalkers, unsolicited photos, but I did not know about what the streets would be like at night and I am shocked that I found SO MUCH RESEARCH even on here that the streets of Shinjuku were relatively safe compared to America, could not disagree more as a female. I was followed twice in one night but I’m very confrontational so I was fine. I was grabbed serval times outside of Golden Gai as I was trying to walk home. There were SO MANY men just on the street like sharks watching you leave the area and cat calling. Before you say they were those people trying to get you into those bars they were not and they seemed like a mix of Japanese and non-Japanese LARGE groups of men just on the street. The amount of catcalling and grabbing honestly compared to large US cities for me. I wish someone had told me this because I would have gotten a hotel in another area or I would have not stayed out as late my first night. SOME AREAS FEEL LIKE AMERICA. I WAS SHOCKED.

2. Shirakawago is a 1 hour experience at most. Do your research before you go. I did not know this, but the business is there are not normal businesses. They have very odd hours and it happened when I went. It was snowing heavily and literally not a single coffee shopper restaurant was open for three hours. All of the shops also sell the same items so there’s nowhere to really hide from the snow. I was out in the snow just walking around the town for three hours. Not a pleasant experience. Do your research on the businesses and if they will be open, but really you just go there to see the buildings.

3. Write an itinerary and then separately write a dream wish list per neighborhood or area you go to. That way instead of feeling like you didn’t accomplish anything when you don’t fulfill your whole itinerary ( which is impossible) you can feel super accomplished if you complete a super simple itinerary, and then manage to do one or two more things in each area.

4. Your Uber cost as shown on the app that you originally paid for can change when you get to your destination. Once again I speak intermediate Japanese and I was surprised when I saw the taxi driver changing the fair when we arrived at our destination to be about ¥3000 more and this happened several times. Of course they could’ve just been increasing the fair since I’m not Japanese and they could get away with it, but it did not seem like this was the case.

Overall, this was the trip of a lifetime. I had such a beautiful time and I’m so proud of myself for making this happen. I have this group to think for a lot of the good information I was given thank you so much.!!!!! ",0,1734765404.0,JapanTravelTips,4,0.4,False

""A Smallville Christmas""


The last couple of years the Kent farm had been a place of peace and tranquility. Clark had learned the importance of this haven. It was where he had spent his childhood, and now it was where he had chosen to build his family with Lana. Jonathan and Martha bought the house Lana grew up in, right next door. Their close presence was much appreciated by Lana and Clark. Now too old to work on the farm, but happy to be so close to their grandchildren, Jonathan and Marta were frequent visitors at the Kent farm.

Married for ten years, Clark and Lana had two children—Julian, their energetic and curious 8-year-old son, and Emily, their beautiful and playfull 4-year-old daughter. Both of them Have dark brown, almost black hair, and a striking resemblance with their parents. Julian looks like what an 8 year old Clark would've looked like, but with hazel eyes like his mother. Emily already is a stunning little girl with her hair in a ponytail most of the time. She has bright blue eyes and Lana's smile. Their lives were filled with love, laughter, and the constant reminder that no matter the challenges, they had each other. Everything was just....right.

It was a crisp December morning on the Kent farm, with the sun just beginning to rise over the horizon, painting the sky in warm oranges and pinks. Because of snowy weather the past couple of days, the farm was looking even more christmassy. Everything was covered with a thick carpet of snow. Clark, dressed in a plaid shirt and faded jeans, stood on the porch, his hands wrapped around a steaming cup of coffee. He was watching the world wake up, savoring the peacefulness of Christmas eve morning.

The farm was decorated in its usual understated style — a few lights strung up around the barn and the house, a modest wreath on the front door, and a snow-covered tree just outside. He could hear Emily around the corner, she was very eager this morning to go outside and play in the fresh snow. Clark smiled to himself, breathing in the cold air.

His reverie was interrupted by the unmistakable sound of laughter behind him. He turned to see Lana standing in the doorway, wrapped in a cozy red scarf and her favorite oversized sweater.

“Careful, Clark,” she teased, “If you stay out here too long, you’ll freeze into a Clark-shaped popsicle.""

Clark chuckled and stepped inside, giving her a tender kiss on the lips while pulling her gently towards him. “Morning, beautiful. Everything’s ready for the big day?”

Lana grinned. “You know me, everything’s in place. Except for one thing.” She raised an eyebrow playfully.

Clark looked at her, confused. “What’s that?”

“Emily’s convinced that Santa is going to drop by the house and have dinner with us tonight,"" Lana said with a smirk. “She’s already left a plate of cookies on the kitchen counter… and a glass of milk… and a carrot for the reindeer.”

Clark raised his hands in mock surrender. “I swear, I didn’t put her up to it.”

He glanced over at the staircase just as he heard the familiar sound of stomping feet. A moment later, Julian came running down the stairs, still wearing his pajamas. His wavy hair was a bit wild, and his face was full of excitement.

“Dad! Dad! You won’t believe it!” Julian said breathlessly, practically vibrating with energy.
“Santa’s sleigh is coming tonight! I saw it in the sky last night, and I swear I saw reindeer!”

Clark blinked, wondering if his son had inherited his imagination or his powers. “You sure about that?”

Julian nodded seriously. “Yes! I saw it through my telescope! And then I heard reindeer hooves on the roof, and I knew it was Santa! He’s coming, Dad!”

Lana raised an eyebrow. “Uh-huh. Did you also happen to see a sleigh parked in the barn?”

Julian shook his head. “No… but maybe he just made it invisible like you sometimes do, Dad!”

Clark froze. He wasn’t sure if he was more impressed by his imagination or concerned that his secret was going to be discovered by his son in a very unexpected way. Did he saw him superspeeding? He couldn't yet trust the children with his secret. They might brag about it to a teacher or to their friends. He knew that when they got old enough he would eventually tell them.

Before he could even respond to his son, a high-pitched voice came from outside. “Mom! Dad! I made a snowman outside, and it’s taller than me! It has a scarf, and a hat, and a carrot nose just like the one i got for the reindeer! You should come and see it!”

Clark and Lana both turned to see their 4-year-old daughter, Emily, standing in the doorway. She was holding her teddy bear, her cheeks rosy from the cold, and her brown hair was tied up in a messy ponytail. They followed Emily outside to look at the snowman.

It was a sad little pile of snow with one eye looking upward, the other one downward and the carrot on a rather questionable location.

“Santa will love your snowman.” Lana said with a smile. Trying not to laugh too hard while looking at Clark.

“Yay!” Emily squealed and then promptly ran back inside the house.

Lana and Clark shared a look, their hearts swelling with love for their children. It was hard to believe that their little family had grown so much. They had their share of challenges, of course, but moments like these — the simple, everyday joys of being together — made it all worth it.

“Want to get started on breakfast?” Lana asked, pulling Clark out of his thoughts.

“Sure,” Clark replied.

As they both walked back to the house they couldn't help but cast a smile at eachother.

Later that day Clark, dressed in a festive red sweater, was standing over the stove, stirring a pot of mashed potatoes. Cooking was something he picked up recently and really enjoyed doing. Luckily he had already improved his skills. More than once the family was forced to take out food when one of Clark's ""experiments"" had gone wrong.

Lana, meanwhile, was in the livingroom carefully arranging ornaments on the tree with Emily perched on her hip, chattering about how ""Santa would be so proud of our tree"" and whether or not Rudolph would be able to find their farm, considering it was ""so far out in the middle of nowhere."" 

In the distance, Jonathan and Martha were finishing up their own preparations for the holiday. They were going to spend christmas eve with Clark and Lana. Jonathan had insisted on making his famous apple cider—he’d gotten the recipe from his grandmother, and Martha had quickly backed him up on his insistence. After all, it was a Christmas eve tradition.

""Everything looks perfect,"" Lana said as she walked back into the kitchen, still holding Emily. ""I can’t believe how quickly the kids have grown"" she said while she looked at her daughter ""Emily's already four and Julian's nearly nine!""

Clark grinned as he added a dollop of butter to the mashed potatoes. ""Yeah, it seems like just yesterday we were chasing after them when they could barely walk. Now Emily is out there building snowmen like she's some kind of Arctic architect.""

Lana bursted into laughter. ""I love this time of year. It's so... magical. It reminds me of when we were kids. You know, the Kent farm was always full of life. I always enjoyed being here.""

Clark's eyes softened, and he set the spoon down. ""I love it too. I’m just glad we get to do it together, with the kids, and—"" He stopped,...

The doorbell rang.

""That’s odd,"" Lana said. She put down Emily and walked to the door answer it. ""It's way too early for your parents to be here""

Opening the door, she was greeted by the sight of Oliver Queen—dressed in a full Santa Claus costume, complete with a big white beard and a bag of wrapped gifts slung over his shoulder.

""Oliver? What on earth are you doing?"" Lana asked, a mixture of surprise and amusement in her voice.

Oliver grinned broadly. ""Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas!"" he bellowed, and then promptly sneezed as the cold air hit him. ""Uh, yeah... We were driving by and thought, 'Hey, what’s more Christmasy than surprising my favorite Smallville family with some gifts and holiday cheer?'""

Behind him, Chloe stepped out of the car, chuckling. ""Well, he tried to resist the impulse, but honestly, once he put on that suit,... You know him... he kind of became an honorary elf.""

Lana looked over at Clark, who had wandered over to the door, scratching the back of his head. He raised an eyebrow. ""Oliver, really? Santa Claus? You couldn’t have just called ahead?""

Oliver shrugged, his smile unwavering. ""Why call ahead when you can make a grand entrance?""

Emily, who had been standing behind her mom, peeked her head around Lana’s legs and gasped. ""Santa?! I knew you would come! See mom, i told you so"" she said with a smirk.

""How did she know?"" Lana asked herself.

Oliver immediately crouched down to her level, his deep voice taking on a friendly, booming quality. ""Ho ho ho! Well, well, little lady. Have you been good this year?""

Emily nodded eagerly, her ponytail bouncing with every movement. ""I have! I’ve been really good! I even helped Mom bake cookies for you!""

Oliver glanced at Lana. ""You’ve been baking cookies? But I didn’t smell any out there.""

Lana shot him a wink. ""Well, I may have hidden a few for later.""

Chloe stepped forward, shaking her head with her typical smile. ""Well, we couldn’t just show up empty-handed, could we? We’ve got gifts for the little ones.""

""Thank you!"" Julian shouted excitedly, who came running towards the surprise guests. He tugged on Oliver’s coat. ""Are there presents for me too, Santa? I saw you last night through my telescope, you were going really fast!""

Oliver grinned. ""Of course! Every good boy gets a present from Santa."" He rummaged through the sack, pulling out two brightly wrapped gifts and handing them to the kids. ""One for Julian, and one for Emily. But, and this is important, you have to make sure to leave cookies out for Santa later. Or else, I might end up giving you... socks.""

Emily gasped in mock horror. ""Not socks!""

Lana laughed. ""I think we can make room for some cookies, and you could even stay for dinner if you like"" She glanced at Clark, who was now leaning in the doorway with an amused expression. ""Well, it looks like we’ve got quite the surprise visitor tonight. Come in, both of you.""

Oliver grinned and walked into the house, Chloe following close behind. ""We didn’t want to miss out on a Christmas Eve in Smallville. And we figured you guys could use a some extra holiday vibes.""

Lana closed the door behind them and they all moved into the living room, where the Christmas tree stood proudly in the corner. The fire crackled in the fireplace, casting a warm glow over the room. Martha and Jonathan had just finished up next door and were heading over, carrying enough cider to keep the party going for days.


÷


The evening proceeded with the usual holiday charm. The kids were practically bouncing off the walls as they tore into their gifts, their excitement filling the room. Clark and Lana exchanged fond glances, watching their children revel in the moment.

""I swear, I’ve never seen Julian so happy,"" Lana said, while she sat herself down on Clark's lap.

""He’s a good kid,"" Clark agreed. ""And Emily’s got the energy of a thousand suns.""

""Like father, like daughter,"" Lana teased, leaning into him.

""The turkey!"" Clark yelled all of a sudden, his voice filled with panic.

Lana looked over at him, a bit confused. ""What about the turkey?""

""The turkey!"" Clark repeated. He jumped up. Lana almost losing her balance, but just managed to stay on het feet.

""I was supposed to check it an hour ago, and now—"" He said while running hastly into the kitchen.

Everyone in the room stopped talking. The festive mood came to a screeching halt. They all waited for Clark to give notice. The silence lasted way too long. After some stumbling around in the kitchen, he finally came out, carrying a huge turkey in a roasting pan.

""It's perfect!"" He said with a big Clark-smile on his face. ""I set a timer for the oven, but i forgot i did so.""

""Dinner's ready!"" Lana said, and as she got up so did everybody else.


÷ 


The Kent family and their long time friends gathered around the large wooden table. The warm glow of candles casting a soft light over the shiny cutlery. At the head of the table Clark was carving the turkey like a true masterchef. Julian and Emily giggled while being served mashed potatoes by Lana. Jonathan and Martha were beaming with pride, and Chloe and Oliver shared smiles and stories. The aroma of the turkey hung in the air as everyone dug in. The warmth and love of friends and family filled the room, on that cozy Christmas evening in Smallville.


Happy holidays everybody!!  
Hope you enjoyed it!

So an update to my earlier posts, but DCS is involved and the plan we set up was to have my husband out by January 1st.  I ended up telling my husband about DCS being involved and he helped me come up with this plan.  We were going to seperate. And then, in the past couple days, he's been asking  so what's the plan/what are we going to do?"" If I say we stick to the plan because DCS wants us to have and stick to a concrete plan, he throws out that he can't afford to care for two households and pay rent for himself.  So he got me to say that he can stay.  During this period of him trying to convince me to let him stay, he would say ""and this isn't me trying to manipulate you or whatever into letting me stay, it's just not feasible"" which made me feel like I was wrong for even thinking he was doing that and I felt like I couldn't say anything against it, because he just said he wasn't doing that. But he is. I know he is. And it's like he's not even aware that he does. He's trying to push  blame on me for the whole DCS report of DV because I told my therapist what happens during our fights sometimes. He even made the vague threat of ""wonder what a therapist would say if I told them all the shit you've done?"" Which, I have done some out of character crap in this relationship. Including hitting him in the head with a kettle after hes spent hours coming at me about every little fault he sees within me and following me from room to room , throwing a SIDE TABLE (not coffee table like he says) in front of him (not at him like he says) as he was following me from room to room and wouldn't let me leave, threw a bottle and hit our TV when he just kept coming at me and talking over me and wouldn't let me say anything, tried to throw myself down the stairs after hearing how useless I was for over an hour, held a knife out at him after hours of him following me and screaming at me, ran out of the house with no shoes in 90 degree weather, punched him in the nose twice (once for grabbing my arm hard as I tried to leave and I just swung my arm around and caught him in the nose because his grip hurt and the other time he had me cornered in our bedroom, blocking me from leaving), and punched him in the head as he latched onto my wrist with his teeth as I tried to call the cops. But he doesn't ever say what he does, only what I do.  My family wants to take the choice from me and just come kick him out (we're living in a house owned by my grandfather), but I want to make the decision.  I want to do this. But he won't freaking leave. I want to press charges, but the last time he was physical and left a mark was at the beginning of November. Can I file a report for past event, even if I don't have proof of everything (only a few pictures throughout the last year, but the physical abuse goes back almost 3).

Thats how unexpectedly I got into this rabbit hole. 

During the time I've familiarized myself with J. Hoffmanns YT channel and listened to his ""The World Atlas of Coffee"" and just finished reading ""How To Make The Best Coffee At Home"" books. L. Hedrick has been the reason for my grinders, and during the Black Friday deals I bought the 1Zpresso K-Ultra. 

About accessories, I've bought some coffee scale which eats batteries way too fast. Asked a friend to 3D print dosing funnel, from Temu got a knock box and a WDT tool, both get the job done, but aren't great. 

I'm glad to see that this enthusiasm hasn't died off a month or two later, I hope it stick around as I want to progress in latte art and eventually try out new things.

1hj4efp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hj4efp/from_minimalist_to_boho_choosing_rugs_to_match/,From Minimalist to Boho: Choosing Rugs to Match Your Interior Style,"Rugs are more than just floor coverings—they’re design statements that can define a room’s ambiance and tie together your decor. Whether your style leans toward sleek minimalism or eclectic boho, the right rug can transform your space. From a simple [black and white rug](https://demo.homeandsouldubai.com/product/black-and-white-rug) to a cozy [circle rug](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/textiles/rugs/round-rugs), there are endless ways to match your rug to your interior style. If you're searching for the perfect [rugs in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs), here’s how to choose one that fits your aesthetic.

# 1. Minimalist Style: Keep It Simple

Minimalist interiors are characterized by clean lines, neutral palettes, and a clutter-free look. When selecting a rug for this style:

* **Choose Neutral Tones**: A **black and white rug** with a subtle geometric pattern can add interest without overpowering the space.
* **Opt for Simple Shapes**: A [round carpet](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/textiles/rugs/round-rugs) works well in minimalist spaces, adding softness and breaking up sharp edges.
* **Focus on Texture**: Go for a rug with a low pile or natural fibers like jute for understated elegance.

For minimalist spaces, the rug should complement the overall simplicity rather than act as the focal point.

# 2. Boho Style: Embrace Eclectic Vibes

Bohemian interiors are all about mixing textures, colors, and patterns to create a cozy, lived-in feel. When choosing a rug for a boho look:

* **Experiment with Shapes**: A **circle rug** can add a playful touch, especially layered with other rugs for a cozy vibe.
* **Use Bold Patterns**: Look for intricate designs or vibrant colors that stand out. Pair a neutral **round carpet** with colorful cushions or wall hangings.
* **Mix and Match Textures**: Combine a high-pile rug with woven ottomans or macramé decor for a rich, tactile experience.

For boho interiors, the rug often serves as a focal point that sets the tone for the rest of the decor.

# 3. Contemporary Style: Balance Style and Functionality

Contemporary interiors blend modern elements with current trends, focusing on clean designs and functional decor. When selecting a rug:

* **Choose a Statement Piece**: A bold **black and white rug** with an abstract or geometric design can become the centerpiece of your room.
* **Use Round Rugs for Versatility**: A **round carpet** works well under coffee tables or in reading nooks, adding a dynamic element to the space.
* **Prioritize Durability**: Look for easy-to-clean materials like synthetic blends if the rug will be placed in high-traffic areas.

In contemporary homes, the rug should balance aesthetics and practicality, seamlessly blending style with everyday use.

# 4. Scandinavian Style: Cozy and Functional

Scandinavian interiors are known for their simplicity, functionality, and cozy elements. Rugs play a key role in creating the signature “hygge” feel:

* **Neutral Colors and Soft Patterns**: A **black and white rug** with a simple stripe or grid pattern can fit perfectly in Scandinavian decor.
* **Focus on Natural Materials**: Wool, cotton, or jute **circle rugs** add warmth and texture to the room.
* **Layer Rugs for Comfort**: Combine a larger neutral rug with a smaller, patterned one to add depth and interest.

Scandinavian style emphasizes warmth and minimalism, so keep your rug choices clean and cozy.

# 5. Industrial Style: Rugged Meets Refined

Industrial interiors combine raw materials like exposed brick and metal with sleek, modern elements. The right rug can soften this look without losing its edgy vibe:

* **Choose a Rug with Contrast**: A distressed **black and white rug** adds texture and complements the industrial palette.
* **Use Round Shapes for Balance**: A **circle rug** can soften the harsh lines of industrial furniture and architecture.
* **Add Warmth with Layers**: Combine a leather sofa with a plush **round carpet** to create a balanced, welcoming space.

Industrial interiors benefit from rugs that contrast with the rugged materials while adding warmth and character.

# 6. Where to Find the Perfect Rugs in Dubai

Dubai is a haven for stylish and diverse home decor options, and finding the perfect rug is no exception. Whether you're looking for a **round carpet** for a cozy corner or a bold **black and white rug** to make a statement, you’ll find plenty of high-quality options in the city’s home decor stores and online platforms.

When shopping for **rugs in Dubai**, consider the following tips:

* Look for designs that complement your overall decor style.

* Shop during sales or promotions for budget-friendly options.

Context: I go to school, and because of this, I don't really have time for a lot of Gym. My Old Diet would consist of me eating whatever was made at home, and one a week, eating out as a **cheat meal**.

Since I don't exercise a lot, I decided to cut down heavily on my diet.

Here is what my new diet looks like:

On School Days, eat sandwiches that mum packs for me, and when I get home, for lunch, lentils with rice. And then skip dinner entirely, optionally some low-sugar cold coffee

On Holidays this is basically the same, but I eat the sandwiches a lot earlier, as the break we get in school is at 11 am, and I eat sandwiches at 9am at home.

In addition, I have skipped the cheat meal entirely. It was so hard, but I managed to pull through.

Since Dieting, I have noticed me losing fat on my face, and legs. I am really happy with this, and so far, I have managed to lose 1kg (doing this diet for approx 8 days).

But, some people think that my new diet is really unhealthy for me. Is this actually true? I wanted to get opinions from people who are actually trying to lose weight, or have already lost weight.",0,1734763688.0,loseweight,0,0.5,False

Just wanted to give a trip report and give kudos to Amtrak, and I think I even converted my coworker to Amtrak!

Started in Pasco, WA with my coworker on the WB Empire Builder to Portland, OR. Got to Portland and had a few hour layover before the SB Coast Starlight made it. Hung out in the Metropolitan Lounge which, while small, was nice and had plenty of snacks and coffee.

Boarded the Coast Starlight on time and met our sleeping car attendant (Tanisha, I believe her name was - very nice employee and we got a picture with her!) Trip was pretty uneventful. Spectacular views along the way. Then we get to the station in Oakland, CA. We're there for a bit, which gave us time to explore the station and take pictures of the San Joaquins train on the next track over. Then we're told to pack our stuff and that we're moving onto that San Joaquins train. They said the Coast Starlight was being terminated at Oakland due to washed out tracks down south.

So, we bid farewell to the sleeping car and Tanisha and board the San Joaquins. Didn't know what to expect, all they had were snacks and water. Made it down to I forget where (somewhere between Bakersfield and two stops prior), then we stop. We're stopped for a while and the conductor comes on the PA and says the engine is having issues, so the next SB San Joaquins train will get in front of us and back up, putting our entire train on the back of theirs. Finally make it to Bakersfield where we're put on Amtrak Thruway buses. Luckily there was one that made a stop in Glendale, which was ultimately our destination. Rode that for I want to say two hours (nice driver as well).

We didn't have any substantial food since around 7:30 a.m. that morning on the Coast Starlight, and had our next meal finally around 11:00 p.m. in Glendale at a place we found.

The trip back north was in contrast very uneventful but still fun (shoutout to our sleeping car attendant for that journey, Augustine - also got a picture with him).

I did call Amtrak Wednesday while we were on the train headed home. They did refund the SB trip (part to my Amtrak credit card, and the rest to the voucher I used that I was given as a result of delays on my EB Empire Builder trip in June).

My coworker had never ridden Amtrak but he's been very supportive of it (he's from Montana originally and was sad that they took out the southern portion of the route). Even after all that, he said it was thoroughly enjoyable and he thinks he's talked up Amtrak enough to his wife now that she'd be a convert too.

I got the sleeve done almost 5 months ago and I've done well so far. Have lost about 65 pounds, only regained during one particularly bad week and I've never had any bad reactions to food or thrown up or anything like that. 

However, I've run into a problem, and that is my water intake. I used to drink water in chugs pre-op. Like, I would drink an entire water bottle within one minute and then do another right after. I'd do this two or three times a day to make sure i got my water intake. Of course, with the sleeve, that's not really possible. However, I have been drinking water faster than i probably should now. I'll drink a full water bottle in about 20 minutes. I take a drink of like 3 ounces and wait a minute or two and then drink again. It doesn't really hurt or anything, and the only sign I ever get to slow down is that I'll start burping, and I slow down after that.  It's the only way I can get all the water intake I need. If I drink water the way I drink everything else (takes me like an hour and a half to drink my morning coffee), I'd never get enough in my system. 

  
Does drinking water this way stretch the pouch? I have been doing it to make sure I'm on track and I don't really feel any pain from it, but was wondering if this will hurt me in the long run and stretch my pouch out. ",2,1734763145.0,gastricsleeve,0,1.0,False

Let's talk about premenstrual syndrome, a condition that affects hundreds of thousands of women worldwide. It all comes down to the physical and emotional symptoms that appear before the onset of your duration. This blog post explores the ins and outs of premenstrual syndrome symptoms, including how common it is, how it might interfere with your life, and coping mechanisms. By delving into those specifics, readers better understand what's happening and how to deal with PMS head-on.

The key to explaining premenstrual [syndrome symptoms](https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/yyhc69/has_anyone_had_mild_serotonin_syndrome_and_what/) is increasing knowledge and making people realise how important it is to manage them. When people know their treatment options, they can better manage PMS and have a smoother transition at that time of the month. Comprehending this disease is not just about knowing what it is; it's also about providing women with the resources and information they require to manage it cooperatively and expectantly.

# What is premenstrual syndrome?

Premenstrual disorder is the term used to describe a range of physical and psychological symptoms that often appear a few days to a few weeks before a woman's [menstrual cycle](https://www.blissnatural.in/blogs/news/menstrual-cycle). These premenstrual syndrome symptoms can differ greatly from person to person, but some common ones include bloating, breast soreness, mood changes, irritability, and exhaustion. While many women have mild symptoms that may be managed with self-care techniques, some may suffer from severe PMS that significantly impairs their quality of life.

# The prevalence and impact of Premenstrual Disorder

A significant proportion of women have premenstrual disorder; estimates indicate that as many as 75% of women experience some kind of this disease at some point throughout their reproductive years. Hormonal changes, neurotransmitter imbalances, and genetic predispositions are thought to have a role in PMS, yet its exact purpose is still unknown. It can have various effects, from mild discomfort to severe impairment of daily functioning, significantly impacting a woman's quality of life.

# Causes of Premenstrual Disorder

Many women have premenstrual disorder in the days preceding their menstrual cycle. Numerous elements are thought to have contributed to its formation, even though its exact reason isn't always known. Changes in hormone levels, particularly in estrogen and progesterone, impact neurotransmitters in the brain, which can cause mood swings and physical symptoms like breast pain and period bloating. 

Anxiety and mood swings are exacerbated by [chemical imbalances](https://healthline.com/health/chemical-imbalance-in-the-brain), which include a drop in serotonin levels. By altering hormone levels, poor dietary choices, such as consuming an excessive amount of sweets, coffee, or alcohol, and high amounts of stress can worsen these problem symptoms.

# Premenstrual Syndrome Symptoms

The premenstrual syndrome symptoms can vary widely in intensity from mild to severe and can differ from one woman to another. Some common symptoms of premenstrual disorder include:

# Mood swings:

Many women like their mood swings during the lead-up and throughout the duration. These may manifest as tension, impatience, dejection, or sudden mood swings.

# Physical symptoms:

[Period bloating](https://www.blissnatural.in/blogs/news/managing-period-bloating), breast soreness, problems, and exhaustion are the physical pains that problems can cause. Digestion problems such as diarrhoea or constipation may be enjoyable to some girls.

# Cognitive symptoms:

Some women may also experience changes in their cognitive functioning during this disease, such as difficulty focusing, forgetfulness, or a hazy mental state.

# Behavioural changes:

It can also influence behaviour, resulting in increased levels of stress, rage, or feelings of being assaulted.

# Treatment Options:

Treatment for PMS is individualised and not universally applicable. However, a plethora of treatments exist to mitigate the effects. Maintaining an active lifestyle through regular exercise, eating a balanced diet, and learning stress-reduction techniques like yoga or meditation can make a difference.

# Diagnosis Options for Premenstrual Disorder

Comparing symptoms over multiple menstrual cycles is part of the diagnosis process for PMS. Symptom diaries are useful tools used by healthcare organizations to track the onset and intensity of symptoms. Furthermore, it's critical to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as depression or thyroid issues. Sometimes, imaging exams or hormone level checks can be required to rule out underlying medical conditions that could be causing premenstrual syndrome symptoms.

# Treatment Options for Premenstrual Syndrome

PMS treatment aims to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Adjusting one's lifestyle to incorporate regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress-reduction strategies can help reduce symptoms. NSAIDs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can also lessen physical symptoms like cramps and other issues.

[Hormonal imbalance](https://www.blissnatural.in/blogs/news/hormonal-imbalance) can relieve premenstrual syndrome symptoms and regulate variations in hormones. Antidepressants or other medications may be administered in severe cases to control indications connected to anger. Getting advice from a healthcare provider can help identify the best course of action customised to each patient's preferences.

# More about Premenstrual Syndrome

It is a collective term for a range of mental and physical symptoms that appear in the days before menstruation. Hormone swings, neurotransmitter alterations, and lifestyle choices all play a role, though the precise cause is unclear. Premenstrual syndrome symptoms can affect daily functioning and pleasant lifestyles, varying widely in severity and duration. Medication, lifestyle modifications, and assistance from healthcare organisations are frequent components of effective management.

# Natural Remedies for Premenstrual Syndrome

Several natural remedies may also lessen premenstrual syndrome symptoms. Hormone balance and bloating can be achieved with dietary changes that decrease the intake of coffee, alcohol, and salt while increasing the intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Signs can also be lessened by consistent exercise, stress-reduction methods like yoga or meditation, and getting enough sleep. Herbal supplements like evening primrose oil, magnesium, or chasteberry can also help, but it's best to speak with a healthcare provider before using them.

# Coping Strategies for Premenstrual Disorder

Managing this disease effectively involves maintaining a healthy lifestyle with a vitamin-rich diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep. Stress-reduction methods, including yoga, mindfulness, and deep breathing exercises, can reduce emotional indications and symptoms. Maintaining a symptom journal facilitates the identification of proactive, control-aware triggers and patterns. Help from friends, family, or support groups offers consolation and practical suggestions for managing it.

# Common Myths and Misconceptions about Premenstrual Disorder

Myths about this disease that are often spread include the idea that it's ""all in your head"" or a justification for being moody. PMS is a recognised medical condition that has physiological and hormonal causes. The idea that all women have intense symptoms is another fallacy. There is a broad variance in the type and strength of symptoms. It helps to promote empathy and accurate knowledge of it when one is aware of those myths.

# Conclusion

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) requires careful management to improve quality of life and effectively manage its signs and symptoms. Understanding the variety of physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms enables women to seek the right care and make healthy lifestyle changes. Periodic physical activity, a well-balanced diet, stress management methods, and professional therapies can significantly reduce premenstrual syndrome symptoms. Further assistance in controlling this disease includes debunking common misconceptions and creating a supportive environment. Through education and proactive measures, women can effectively manage the difficulties associated with this disease, resulting in a more seamless transition between their menstrual cycles and overall well-being.",1,1734762897.0,u_LavishnessFast7437,0,1.0,False
1hj43ji,https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/1hj43ji/qol_todo_list/,QoL To-Do List,"To end the year 2024 with a Christmas present to FD, I thought I'd post a To-Do list. If the community response is positive I will update this regularly, to serve as a developer-side complement to [Luriant's player To-Do list](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/15a0c69/luriants_todo_list/).

I know many suggestions have already been proposed to FD. I've seen documents and wishlists 50 pages long. What I'm trying to do is avoid new feature suggestions or gameplay modifications, as these can be very subjective: would ship interiors be nice? Is Powerplay 2.0 fun? Should exobiologists have more than one canister? Why does gold take up cargo space while iron doesn't?

This list focuses on quality-of-life improvements and fixes that most developers involved with and passionate about their creation ***would naturally do***, even in their spare time, in order to make the system they design more coherent, elegant or easier to interact with.

I hope the community finds this useful and that folks at FD would implement at least some of these suggestions. I've broken down the list into three categories based on time estimates of the work involved, but I may be wrong as I have no idea of how the code base is organised.

## Easy (coffee break)

- Shipyard > Your ships : sort the ships by last used first
- Mission board : add an icon to a mission if it involves an illegal passenger
- Mission board : change the icon for a Fed/Imperial rank mission to something more beginner-friendly
- Inventory panel : accelerate cargo transfer if the control binding is held (as with most commodity dialogs)
- Tritium Depot : add a button ""Donate from carrier cargo""
- Galaxy Map : enable ""Set carrier destination"" when carrier cooldown is complete (currently requires closing and reopening the Galaxy Map)

## Medium (a couple of days)

- Controls preferences : add search box to control bindings
- HUD : add SCO cooldown timer
- Carrier Management : show players currently docked on the player's carrier
- Assets : run all game text assets through a spell checker
- Outfitting : allowing fitting a module from another docked ship belonging to the same player (at least if it's not a core module)
- Galaxy Map : optionally show icons above systems with player-stored modules
- Shipyard > Your ships : show paint jobs (and ship kits if possible) in ship selection, instead of generic colors
- Shipyard : ask to jettison cargo when switching ships (instead of displaying a ""excess cargo"" message)
- Outfitting : allow transferring a stored module or ship to a specific station instead of the player location (using the same Galaxy Map dialog as a fleet carrier)
- Controls preferences : add new bindings, some suggestions:
  - Launch Caustic Sink
  - Target Nearest Enemy
  - Supercruise assist on/off
  - Landing Assist on/off
  - Launch SLF (player or first pilot)
  - Request Docking
  - Toggle Reset Relative Mouse
  - Save/Load PIP preset
- Mission board : better filtering of rewards by type, hide irrelevant missions when filtered

## Hard (several weeks)

- Increase texture variety on gas giants and stars
- [Fix flickering shadows](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/1hizzfy/please_dev_i_beg_you_to_focus_on_the_flickering/)
- Improve antialiasing

1. Electric fan. We use the bulky type para malakas talaga. Pagpasok sa room electric fan muna then saka lang mag aircon after 2 hrs. 

2. We buy things in bulk if laging ginagamit. Soy sauce na 3.7 L, Detergent in 10 kg, Cooking oil na 5L mga ganun. Then refill na lang sa containers para estitik (aesthetic). 

3. Facemask and alcohol. Call me OA/praning pero I still wear my mask especially in public places or anywhere na siksikan. Mahal magkasakit not only applies to check-up/medicine/hospitalization but also in income lost due to absences.

4. Clothes. It's been years since I last bought clothes (exception ang uniform since required sa work and mga underwear). I just shift them around when I declutter. Tinatago ko muna then  after 3-6 months ilalabas ko ulit. My goal is to maximize the use of my clothes before I buy again.

5. Coffee. We started brewing our coffee again this year. We used to do it when I was younger however with the accessibility of 3-in-1 mas naging convenient na.

How much would I need to spend on an electric grinder to get comparable grinds to this? Ideally, I wouldn’t want to spend more than $400 however I could be sold on something in the $500ish range if the experience or potential longevity of the grinder made sense.

1hj3zcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1hj3zcj/replacing_aer_city_pack_with_goruck_gr1/,Replacing AER City Pack with Goruck GR1? ,"I've had a [City Pack (non-Pro)](https://aersf.com/products/city-pack?variant=39612776349792&country=US) for a while now, and really like overall dimensions and especially the straps and back panel (love the back panel!).

However, I hate the two compartments, which I feel like reduce the 14L (tbh, I had recalled it was 16L, but my bad) to less usable space than that - based on my load. I chose that size because I was really looking for something smaller, but perhaps went too small.

I tend to use it first and foremost to internally carry a 20 oz Hydroflask and 20 oz Stanley coffee carafe (?). I'll even put a couple of cans of seltzer in between. Then jam a Steamdeck in front of that. And then odds and ends, including a [small-medium notebook](https://a.co/d/aNAAVpS). It fits ... ish ... under duress. (Sometimes a smaller laptop at the back)

So I've been thinking about a single compartment - I don't really like all the pockets and organizers anyway. I'd rather get a tech organizer. 

I am looking at [Goruck GR1](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1-usa?variant=43461048828004) - obviously 21L is a lot more than 14L (one might say 50% or 7L more!). But the exterior dimensions are the same, and weight is only 4 oz more - seems like a no-brainer. 

I am also looking at the [16L Laptop Bullet](https://www.goruck.com/products/bullet-ruck-laptop) - but if City Pack is my physical baseline, I suppose there's no reason to ""step down"". 

Finally, I'm incredibly tempted by the incredibly expensive [Heritage variant](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1-usa-heritage?variant=44737813381220). Are they about a lb more weight? I suppose there's no reason to take an expensive product and make it even more so, but they look so nice. And would go well with my [Waterfield Bolt Duffel](https://www.sfbags.com/collections/all-purpose-bags/products/outback-waxed-canvas-duffel-bag?variant=11045142277) (which contrary to the pictures is actually more greenish than tan, but still lovely).

I am 23
I have a best friend from School over 15 years. We had our ups and downs now we are in good terms but her another best friend is back in her life, they were having problems and was out of touch for 3 years. I was so happy for them. Her another best friend doesn't like me Idk why but it's ok. Their families are close too, my parents are toxic they doesn't like me or my friends so yeah no chance of our parents being friends. Her other best friend ghosted and blocked her suddenly they are back together as friends they overcome their difficulties when me and her was out they met in the same coffee shops, hugs and cries I loved that they were back. But after that she started to avoid me. Doesn't call, if I call she ignores, doesn't reply to messages but she is online and and using Instagram too, it's been one month. At first I thought maybe they are catching up I was ok with it. But gradually I realised she is ignoring me...we talked once she said Oh I saw you calling I ignored because I wasn't in mood...I said ok then she said I called you because she is busy we can't talk I have two options now. Because she is busy I thought I will call her later and now I can call you. I was so hurt lol I mean she is busy so you are calling me? Oh the moment of realisation I laughed and said yeah option she was like yeah. I don't want to loose my best friend. It happened again I am always the option lol never the choosen one. I actually thought she actually think me as her bestfriend as she said, she always used to call we used to hangout and share things but well I guess she did because her best friend ghosted her. Maybe I was never her bestfriend as she was mine, I just wish she told me that before hand. She said that listen I will call you later she haven't call ( we talked for sometimes ).
All of my life for all my friends and family I was the option except for when they need help :)

There were many unethical elements of his therapy, but I was wondering if the way he acted when the session was terminated violated HIPPA.

I started therapy at 17, and told my parents I’d like to quit therapy about a month after I turned 18. After I decided to quit, this therapist called up both of my parents and attempted to convince them to bring me back.

He told my dad that he thinks I was lying in my last session and told me that I’d be living at home forever and that I’ll never graduate from college (I’m a UCLA graduate now). Also a few months after I stopped seeing him, he ran into my dad at a coffee shop that was close to my dad’s place of work. He approached my dad in public to start a conversation with him and told him that he really wanted to speak to me again.

It’s too late to report by now, but I can’t help but wonder… did his behavior violate HIPPA given that I just turned 18? I also remember sharing with him that I just had a birthday during one of the sessions, so this wasn’t a case of ignorance.

My story: I had a very aggressive, five centimeter tumor, and before I knew it, had a port placed and started chemo on december 22 of 2022 only a few weeks after being diagnosed. I remember the night before chemo, I went up to my mom and absolutely broke down sobbing and told her that I wanted off this ride. But it was the strangest feeling knowing that that wasn't possible. I had to show up for the scariest day of my life in order to not die. It's really indescribable that place, and I know many of you are feeling the same. The best piece of advice I can give you, which I also received here...is to just show up. That is all you need to do. You will be surrounded by amazing nurses who know exactly how to get you through the day. Try not to anticipate too much. Make sure you take all the meds they are willing to give you (especially the Ativan) and know that the first step is going to be the scariest. You're going to find a rhythm during chemo. It's hard.  You're going to feel like shit. You're going to look in the mirror at your alien eyes with no eyelashes and wonder who the hell is staring back at you. But you're going to have days that feel normal-ish too. In fact, five days after my first infusion I felt well enough to go to a restaurant for dinner and even had a glass of wine!! During my five months of chemo I went fishing, went to some great restaurants, did some hiking, and never missed one of my kids' baseball games. I did, however, miss basketball games in the gym (too risky with flu season and Covid), let my husband take parent teacher conferences solo, and spent a lot of days in bed watching the world go by.  But! It worked. And chemo will do its thang. Have faith in that. 

Today...two years since embarking on active treatment...I worked out at the gym, had coffee with a friend, worked a full day at my job, and was back in that basketball gym cheering on my son who is playing for his high school. I'll never forget where I've been. And I don't want to. Cancer is like a factory reset button....it will take time, but you'll power back on. I promise. 

I'm here for any of you who need an ear. Much love sweet sisters. Find a friend on here who is going through chemo at the same time. That's what I did and it helped me so much. You know who you are chemo class of '23 🙌🏻🫶🏻💕",17,1734761678.0,breastcancer,4,1.0,False
