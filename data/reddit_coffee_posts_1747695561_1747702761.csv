1kqs9j4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kqs9j4/i_f20_have_feelings_for_my_best_friend_m22_how/,I (F20) have feelings for my best friend (M22) how can I move forward?,"So I’ve been friends with ‘Jack’ (code name) for about a year. When we first met he said he was in a relationship so obviously that was a no-go! Any intentions I have with someone is usually 100% gone when I find out they’re with someone else. 

But unfortunately this wasn’t the case this time. We’ve become very close: confiding in each-other, going out, having many deep meaningful conversations and spending a lot of time together etc. We have a lot of the same values and morals/ want the same things in life. And I appreciate so many of his attributes. All in all we get along great and we connect on such a deep level.  

He is incredibly sweet, sensitive and mature and honestly I have never met a guy who is so genuinely nice and good. Over time I found myself gaining feelings for him.

Now for context Jack is in a long distance relationship which has been in turmoil since we started the friendship. He gets treated very poorly and everyone that’s close to him has been begging him to break it off and they actively (including his family) do not like her. He confides in me a lot about his relationship and I advise him from a place of true friendship/affection not as some manipulative ‘i want u to break up’ vibe. I truly care for him and only want him to be happy. And honestly because none of us have met his gf and we only hear negativity from him about the relationship my brain almost doesn’t compute that it’s real. 

Obviously I’d never out right try anything with him and I would never as long as he’s committed to someone else. While I can’t control my feelings I do feel it’s wrong to be pining after someone in a relationship and have tried a lot to put a stop to my emotions and have failed. 

I’ve liked him for over 6months now, which is by far the longest I’ve ever liked someone. Just my luck. This is the first time a “crush” has felt like something more than just surface level. I’ve actually gotten to know him deeply as a friend and have come to care about him a lot. 

On a very very drunk night out I regretfully asked Jack if he’d ever give us a chance if he was single . He replied that “he wouldn’t want to ever hurt me and he thinks he would, so as of the guy he is right now, its a no” 
I just said “ok” which he replied, “you’re one of the greatest people I know and I’m not ready for someone like you.” 

I didn’t quite understand it. He’s not a blunt kind of guy and is very cautious when anybody’s feelings are involved so maybe he was just trying to soften the blow but idk.
I don’t remember a lot about these drunk conversations but something he always mentions when this topic comes up is “i’m still figuring myself out”. 
Or one time (drunk) he said we wouldn’t work because we have “too much in common” and we “aren’t mature enough to handle each-other’s anxieties.”

Which by the way: a) we actually have very little in common other than just core values and b) I really don’t have any big issues/traumas like that so I don’t know what he was on about. Not to mention, the girls he’s had long term relationships with are all emotionally avoidant, toxic and traumatised. While I am the opposite. 

The guys either just throwing every excuse in the book at me or he’s just not ready for someone mentally sound or he simply doesn’t ever want me. 
Obviously i know this will all only lead to me getting hurt so I decided that I was going to move on. 

Until one particular night out….
A bunch of us, including a lot of his family our age gathered to go out. 
We all got very drunk and at one point I was having a conversation with his cousin who he’s VERY very close with and his cousin asks if i like Jack. I was really taken aback because this was my second time meeting this cousin and I don’t think I did anything in particular with Jack to convey I liked him. But clearly my aura was just giving it off or something. 
I was absolutely hammered so of course I lost all composure and broke down. I explained to his cousin i felt shame about these feelings and that Jack had already told me that he wouldn’t date me even if he was single. 

His cousin comforted me a lot and told me that Jack is a very loyal person and he has a lot of guilt so he can’t allow himself to view me in a romantic way right now. He kept telling me to ‘trust him’ over and over again and that Jack would be breaking up with his gf soon and that I should have some patience and be his friend for now and after some time something romantic could pick up. He said I was a great girl and everyone loves me and that I just need to be patient. 

This really threw me for a loop. Because this is one of Jack’s closest friend/family, so I felt like his word really meant something. 

Context: jack was planning to visit his girlfriend the following week to break up with her. 

So after this night, like the silly woman I am I decided to hold out hope and just wait from afar because my delusional romantic brain thought ‘he’s worth it’ maybe this is some hollywood romance film. News flash. It wasn’t. 

Jack visited his girlfriend and they did not in fact break up. Obviously after hearing this I realised how pathetic I was being and I told myself ‘no more of this’. 
I distanced myself and decided to focus on me. 
For a month I really got over it. Like really and truly I felt 0 for him. 

But then slowly as I stopped distancing myself the feelings seeped back. They’re not as intense, but they almost like simmer in the back of my mind. And they fluctuate. Somedays I think nothing of it, other days he’s all that’s on my mind. 
Jack always tells me how I’m a very beautiful girl (ik im his type) and I’m fun and kind and interesting and he thinks so highly of me. He always tells me that he doesn’t get how i’m insecure because I’m very attractive. 
He says I’m gf/wife material and that his family are big fans of mine. He even asked me what my mother thought of him and if he’d ever meet her. He’s invited me to go to the gym with him and other activities. I’ve also met his family and have even had coffee with his parents, slept at his house. 
Family is a big value of mine and I honestly adore his family which made me like him more. 
Can you really blame a girl here?

Hek we dance in the middle of the street when theirs music and he tells me that he doesn’t dance as much around his gf because she finds that stuff embarrassing or emasculate. 

I feel at ease and safe around him and honestly I’ve never truly trusted a guy before him. 
It’s really hilariously tragic knowing his own gf views him as trash and he’s chasing the shi out of her and then me, this random girl that popped up a year ago thinks the world of him and he says he wouldn’t ever date me. What is this world 🤡 I’m a whole ass clown aren’t I. 

My delusional mind would like to think something could happen here in the future but the realistic side thinks he won’t ever like me like that. And honestly a part of me hopes he stays in his relationship just so I won’t have to deal with the heartbreak of him not choosing me even when he is single. 
I keep telling myself theirs a chance one-day because of how great we get along, how much he compliments my appearance, thinks highly of me, remembers the little details and tells me I’d make a great gf. But ik humans are far more complicated than that. 

But honestly he’s also just a really nice guy and maybe I’m just kidding myself. 
I’ve made it clear through our friendship that I’m a “no games” wear ur heart on ur sleeve kind of girl and honestly Ik that’s not appealing to most guys who seek a chase or toxicity. 
It’s all very bitter sweet because my dream relationship scenario is to build a strong foundation of friendship with a guy first before romance but I’m thinking the ‘romance’ isn’t going to come to fruition. 

Anyway wrapping this up. Ik this is a LOT. Please share your opinions. 
I was reluctant to post this because it feels really immoral to feel this much for a taken guy, honestly I feel like I’m doing something bad. But I need advice because Idk anymore. 

Ps: funniest part is I actually had a close male friend some months prior to all this who stopped being friends with me because he had feelings for me and I didn’t share them. Is this karma? 💀",1,1747702612.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False
1kqs8ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/italianlearning/comments/1kqs8ar/etiquette_for_speaking_italian_in_italy_and_a/,Etiquette for speaking Italian in Italy and a person replying back… in English,"I’m a Londoner currently holidaying in Italy and have been thrilled to see the last four years of part time Italian study (Duolingo/weekly Preply tutor) has paid off in a big way. I’m now pretty conversational and a making the most of it. 

However, being more confident to speak to Italian here (especially in touristy places) has brought about a slightly new dynamic to the surface: what to do when the other person understands me but still tries to change the conversation to English?

Take, for instance, buying a shirt where the salesperson understands everything I’ve said, wrapped my gift up and, upon twigging I’m from an English speaking country, asked me: ‘anything else?’. 

In this case I happily changed over to English as she was super polite and seemed delighted to chat. When she struggled for a word in English, I asked her the Italian then translated it, imagining we might switch back to Italian, but she carried on in English. Again, no problem with that. 

However a day or two later while ordering a coffee at a service station, I had a similar experience, when the person, stony-faced and who sighed as she took my order, understand my request clearly, made the drink and then asked: ‘takeaway or here?’ Without a second’s hesitation I replied: ‘qui, grazie’. And then she proceeded to finish the rest of the transaction in Italian.

I’ve no problem with it really - fully understand that many Italians (usually young people) may want to practice their English, or may assume their English may be better and thus easier way to complete the transaction- but I find it fascinating and wonder if anyone else has reached a similar level where you almost have to wrestle back the language, and all the subtleties that come with it…

In many ways it feels like a conversation within a conversation - subtle, probing, a test even. I love it and feel it’s a great part of learning a language. 

But should I be so direct to reply in Italian if they respond in English? I am after all, the visitor.

And before you say ‘your Italian is probably poor’, you’re probably not wrong, but I’ve been holding ten minute-plus conversations with people in Italian crossing a range of topics since I’ve been here. 

Be curious to know if anyone has any examples of similar instances and what it took to always have a response back in Italian. ",1,1747702508.0,italianlearning,1,1.0,False

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/1aUvqSe)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you’ve watched recently?

1kqs5hi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1kqs5hi/aita_for_breaking_up_with_my_ex_of_5_months/,AITA for breaking up with my ex of 5 months,"Im Clark(30m) and i met my gf or ex gf rather, Joy(27m) through Bumble December of last year. We became official on January of this year, things happened so fast since we clicked the moment we matched. In hindsight, I should have considered it a red flag. We were in a Long Distance Relationship

Things started to unravel February when a burner account messaged her on facebook. The dummy account asked if we were a couple and for how long? Afterwhich she blocked me on all of her socials. I was taken aback by this and i was caught so off guard that i panicked and almost tried to jump off the balcony of my condo. Though she apologized profusely thereafter and i thought it was just an isolated incident. The second one occured last month when we argued as to how we would divide the household expenses once we get married, she was adamant that it should be 60/40 me bearing the 60, it turned into somewhat of a heated argument and i thought it was just that, something all couples go through. It was to my shock when she said she was contemplating if we would work and hinted breaking up with me. I tried so hard to make it up to her and we eventually made amends the night after.

The third incident, the one which made me totally consider if I want to be with her anymore when she broke up with me a the third time. For context we had an agreement that we would inform each other where we are since we are LDR. I know now that arrangement would have been to toxic for her since she was preparing for the bar exam while working a full time job. Going back to the story, she failed to inform me that she was already in the coffee shop, i just came to know she was there when i called her, she was already there for 2 hours. I got disappointed and i didnt really put an effort to hide it, she got mad and called me toxic and inconsiderate and childish. I just kept my mouth shut and decided to just call her the night after. During that call she broke up with me, that was when i blew up, thinking how she could break up again with me over such a small thing, I insulted her and called her names, in particular I called her feeble minded and emotionally immature. I was not proud of what i said and if given a chance to relive that moment again I would have just kept my mouth shut.

After 2 days, she reached out to me saying how deeply hurt she was by what I said and that she doesnt think out situation could be fixed. I also said to her crying breakup over small things is indeed immature and just shows she is not ready for a mature and serious relationship. She then made amends and said we could make this work and I agreed.

Fast forward a week later, she confessed to me that the things I said still bothered her and wondered if we would still be the same. I told her that I know forgiveness is a process and I am willing to go through it. We had a deep talk and to cut it short, we agreed she would never breakup with me over small things while I promised that I will never say those kinds of words to her again.

Then 2 days ago, she called me at around 11:20 in the evening since she was having an anxiety attack. I was not able to answer since my phone was on sleep mode hence it did not even vibrate. I woke up at around 12 and noticed around 3 to 4 missed calls from her. So i tried calling her a couple of times but she did not answer, thinking she was a sleep i just left her a message apologizing profusely. The next day she told me it was ok and she understood but she gave me a cold shoulder the whole day. At night we talked without mentioning the incident so i thought the situation was ok.

Then just yesterday when we were on a videocall while i was at work she was ranting about how her workmates were talking badly about her. It was almost an hour long rant and mind you I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid so paying attention isnt really one of my strong suits. Back to the story, I just asked about a certian detail of the story that I failed to capture and she got mad, saying I wasnt listening to her. I tried to prove to her that I listened by summarizing the story she ranted. She said it was ok so I thought it was the end of it. Fast forward to last night, she was cold to me so i asked what was wrong. She said that she feels that I wasnt there for him since I did not listen to her and that I did not answer her midnight calls 2 days ago. I thought I already explained to her and that she was reasonable enought to understand.

That was when I had enough and tried to end the relationship thinking it was already too toxic for us. She then blocked me on all her socials.

1kqs5eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/landscaping/comments/1kqs5eu/backyard_ideas_for_renters/,Backyard Ideas for Renters?,"Hello. 

We are renting this place that has a backyard, but it's barren and just full of weeds. We plan on living here for at least a few years, but not forever. Does anyone have any ideas for any simple/low (ish) cost things we can do to make the yard slightly more inviting?

The landlord pays the water and we sometimes have droughts/water restrictions in our area, so we can't do anything that would require a large amount of water use. The landlord is just an individual person, not a company,and is fairly laid back with things. We can definitely ask his permission to make some changes to the yard. 

We also live in an area that is extremely hot and dry in the summer with most days being triple digits.  Sometimes above 115°. 

I'm not expecting to turn it into a wonderland or anything, but I would love to be able to enjoy sitting out there with coffee and a book. I don't really care about the section that slopes down towards the back fence. Just the top flat section mainly. ",1,1747702261.0,landscaping,2,1.0,False
1kqs4wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1kqs4wf/lost_on_what_to_do/,Lost on what to do,"I'm 18 and have been out of highschool for a few months, I live in Australia.

Im in a rut in my life right now when it comes to my future careers and if I want to study.

A background for me is, I did most of my highschool online due to bullying, extreme anxiety and possible ADHD (that I can't afford to get diagnosed or treated). University's ask for an ATAR number which mine was N/A and I have no idea why, I completed my schooling completely and legitimately but I think it's because I mostly chose creative subjects to get through.

I did a barista course and tried to get into the field but found that while I loved the workflow, the other parts of the job that didn't involve coffee and also the shady state of the hospitality industry completely ruined it for me.

I got to the place I'm in right now by leaving one crappy fast food job to work at a cafe, which I then got fired from on my first shift because I contacted head office about being paid under minimum wage and without any onboarding paperwork.

So now I'm unemployed and lost, I have an amazing boyfriend who is helping me through this but he has his whole future in order, he's studying and working as a musician and makes more money than I did working normally.

While I am a musician too I don't want that to be my field. Im passionate about many scientific topics, mainly history, conservation, interesting shit like that, but those aren't good for jobs and I may not even be able to get into a course without an ATAR. And I don't even know if I'd be able to handle the workload and keep motivated.

I worked retail when I was younger and it was fine but I hate not feeling like I'm doing anything, I hate just taking people's money and that being my job, I want to be able to nerd out about somethinga nd share my interests with others and make a difference but those careers just aren't possible with competition and the studying.

I'm sorry for the ramble, I just feel really lost right now and I don't know what to do.

1kqs44y,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmutFinderCom/comments/1kqs44y/trans_erotica_story_the_space_between/,Trans Erotica Story: The Space Between,"In the heart of the bustling city, nestled high above the urban jungle, lay the loft of Maiah. The space was a sanctuary of sleek lines and warm, inviting textures. The scent of fresh coffee wafted from the kitchen, mingling with the faint aroma of old books and the subtle hint of Maiah's signature perfume. 

The sun cast a golden glow through the floor-to-ceiling windows, dancing on the polished wooden floors and reflecting off the modern art adorning the walls. Maiah, her dark hair cascading down her shoulders, moved with an effortless grace, her smoky eyes scanning the room as she prepared for her day. 

The sound of a soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts. She smiled, knowing who it was. Barbara, her ex-lover, stood in the doorway, a playful glint in her sharp green eyes. ""Maiah, darling,"" she purred, her voice like velvet. ""I heard you were looking for someone to spice up your day."" Maiah raised an eyebrow, her lips curving into a mischievous smile. ""Barbara, you know I never turn down a good time."" 

As Barbara stepped inside, the air crackled with an electric tension, a reminder of the passion they once shared. But Maiah's mind was not on the past. She was drawn to the sound of a soft melody coming from the other side of the loft. Will, his warm hazel eyes reflecting the sunlight, was sitting on the couch, his fingers dancing over the strings of his guitar. The music filled the room, a soft, sensual melody that seemed to echo the unspoken words between them. Maiah's heart skipped a beat as she looked at Will, his calm intensity drawing her in. She knew this was a moment that could change everything.

Maiah's gaze lingered on Will, her heart pounding in her chest. She paused in her movements, her eyes tracing the curve of his jaw, the way his fingers danced over the guitar strings, the soft smile that played on his lips. There was a familiarity in his touch, a comfort that spoke of shared secrets and unspoken promises. 

She remembered the first time she saw him, the way his eyes had held hers, a dance of curiosity and desire. They had met at a local music festival, their hands brushing as they reached for the same drink. She had felt the spark then, a connection that transcended words. Now, here he was, in her loft, his presence filling the room with a warmth that was both comforting and intoxicating.

As Barbara moved to sit beside Will, Maiah felt a pang of jealousy, but it was quickly replaced by a sense of determination. She wanted this moment, this connection, for herself. She walked over to them, her heels clicking softly on the wooden floor. ""Will,"" she said, her voice a low purr, ""you know, I've always had a soft spot for musicians."" She leaned in, her shoulder brushing against his, her breath warm on his ear. ""Especially ones who can make a guitar sing like that."" She felt his body tense, his breath hitching slightly. 

She smiled, a mischievous glint in her eyes. ""What's your story, Will? How did you end up here, in my loft, playing your heart out?""

It’s frustrating - most listings are vague, buried, or just outdated.

So I started curating them.

Each week, I pull together a shortlist of 3-5 interesting local businesses for sale - some by owner, some by broker - and send them out via Substack. I include summaries of the asking price, cash flow, and light commentary.

Think: coffee shops, laundromats, food trucks, service companies, and the occasional wildcard like a niche ecom store.

If you’re curious about what’s out there - whether to buy, browse, or just learn what a small biz looks like - I’d love to share it with you.

What to expect:

* For sale by owner + broker listings
* Transparent pricing, cash flow, and deal commentary
* Always curated, no spam

1kqs38k,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonAgeVeilguard/comments/1kqs38k/finally_completed_veilguard/,Finally Completed Veilguard,"There's definitely 100s of these posts so I'm using this as a bit of a recap for myself but would love to hear if others agree.

Overall I'm quite torn on the game, there was so much I loved about it but so much that felt more like work rather than enjoyment.

**What I loved**

*Graphics*

Genuinely beautiful in places. Arlathan forest with it's floating water and structures 

*Hair mechanics*

I mean they really deserve credit here. I've never felt so majestic.

*Fighting animations*

Playing the game I didn't actually have much time to appreciate them, but watching someone else play you do see the effort put into characters movement 

*The whole elven gods being bad*

I'm a broken record. I have played an elven mage in almost every DA game so seeing that flip on it's head was really interesting 

*The other factions*

It was really nice getting a feel for the scale of the world. Skyhold's table was amazing but I feel like Veilguard really brought us into those locations and it's made me want to replay DAI again.

*Assan*

My boy 

-------------

**What I didn't love**

*Rook's storyline*

Who exactly are we? I went Veil Jumper but other than a really minor mention about Rook's past you're just this person who Varric met and suddenly you're saving the world. I feel like this is a whole missing quest line somewhere, but please say if it's just the VJ storyline 

*The combat*

Once I got the hang of it I enjoyed it, but I don't think I've ever dodged so much in any video game. I also really disliked how weak the companions were. I love them having their own skill trees but I honestly didn't really put much effort into them as it was all down to Rook most of the time.

*The decorating*

This feels incomplete. There are so many things to buy/unlock but the effects they have on the Lighthouse feel really minor. And don't even get my started on Rook's 'room'. They didn't even have a bed? Call me a princess but I am partial to a tower.

*Item upgrading*

Not a massive fan of having to find the same items to upgrade the current ones, this felt pretty tiresome 

*Item/Skill swapping*

Especially in the last levels not being able to switch during battle was really stupid. Suddenly going from Fire to Ice vulnerability meant I had to essentially exploit the game by catching my character before they drew their weapon

*Romance*

I've honestly had hotter exchanges with my postman. Alistair and Cullen (Don't judge my type) felt like genuine connections, I chose Lucanis this time and I swear down the most effort that dude put into my characters affection was remembering my coffee order. Thanks babe x

*The Helm Designs*

Bruh.
I'm no stranger to turning helms off in most RPGs, but this was a need not a desire. I find it baffling that a game that put so much effort into character creation made 80% of the helm's cover your entire face.


There's absolutely more that I'm missing but overall I did enjoy it, I'm just disappointed that it feels a little half baked. In my opinion they prioritised trying to be like a God of War so much that they lost a bit of the Dragon Age flair ",2,1747702076.0,DragonAgeVeilguard,0,0.75,False

1kqs1em,https://www.reddit.com/r/shmups/comments/1kqs1em/question_about_espgaluda_2_emulation/,Question about Espgaluda 2 emulation,"So I was watching Marus' amazing Espgaluda 2 run at shmup slam 7 two days ago and after his run he mentioned that you can emulate the game on xenia (which I knew about), but then he mentioned something about ""coffee pope's main branch"" improving dramatically on accurate slowdown and suggested save states were possible. What is he talking about? I can't find anything about this via google search. Xenia Canary doesn't have save states nor a branch like he describes leading me to believe he is talking about a different emulator. Here is the link to the video and the time code where he says it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvoXYoR7mFk&t=36040s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvoXYoR7mFk&t=36040s) 

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

  
u/MarusMPO  Maybe if I'm lucky you'll see this and let me know what you were talking about :)",1,1747701926.0,shmups,1,1.0,False
1kqs0fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/R4R30Plus/comments/1kqs0fa/40_tf4r_cleveland_ohio_seeking_main_campaign/,40 [TF4R] Cleveland Ohio Seeking Main Campaign Partner,"# **About Me (Expanded Edition):**

**Pan-romantic Ace and proud!** Emotional connection is my love language—physical stuff is strictly DLC, not base game. Ask me anything!

**Forever DM & LARPer**—If your ideal date involves:

- Rolling nat 20s on flirting checks.
- Debating whether ""Lawful Neutral"" is code for ""boring.""
- Overnight LARP events where we pretend we’re not freezing in a tent.
- Crying over fictional characters like it’s our job.…then congratulations, we’re already fanfic OTP material.

**Writer & Professional Story Goblin**—I hoard tropes, re-tellings, and character arcs like a dragon with a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Romance? Love is Blind scenarios? Fresh spins on classic tales? YES. (Bonus if you want to rant about them with me after.)

**Magic: The Gathering Commander Player**—I enjoy:

- Politicking my way to victory.
- ""Friendly"" games that last 4+ hours.
- Arguing whether counterspells are evil (they’re not; cry about it).

**Media Snob with a Heart of Gold**—I’ll tear apart a lazy comic adaptation with citations, but I’ll also cry at a well-done romance subplot. Fight me (or join me; your call.)

**Neuro-divergent mess**—Even simple concepts can confuse me. Will ask alot of clarifying questions even if they have obvious answers. Tend to repeat questions a day or week later due to fogetting.

**Trans Woman**—Proud, open, and living my best life. If that’s an issue, exit stage left before I cast ""Power Word: Cringe"" on you.

**No Casual Mentality**—I’m here for the epic romance arc, not a filler episode.

**Adventure or Bust**—I need someone who actually leaves the house. Yes, cozy nights are great, but if your idea of excitement is only marathon shows, we might not vibe. Road trips, Ren Faires, hiking, spontaneous day trips, or even just exploring weird little towns? Let’s go.

**Quest Completionist**—My main quest is to get seal it deal and adopt a child. If you do not want to eventually complete that quest with me, please do not ask to join my party.

# **Why I’m Objectively Awesome (According to Me & My Cat):**

- Officially dubbed **""The Most Adorable Human""** (*Source: My mirror. My cat. Peer-reviewed.*)
- **Empathetic listener + hype woman**—I’ll remember your niche hyper fixations and send you memes so specific, you’ll question reality.
- Matching Ren Faire/cosplay outfits? Done. Themed date nights? Obviously. Reading fanfic aloud dramatically? Already warming up my voice
- I will learn your ""useless"" fun facts and weaponize them later to make you smile.
- **My love language is physical touch**—translation: I cuddle like it’s my divine purpose.

# **Deal-Breakers (AKA ""Don’t Waste My Time""):**

- **Smoking/vaping or excessive drinking.**

- **Skipping the safety video call** within the first month (*non-negotiable; Not falling for that again!*).

# **The Quest:**

If you’re kind, emotionally mature, and ready to build something real, **message me:“Hi” + your favorite animal + where you read this** (*or I’ll Wild Shape into someone who ghosts you*).

## **Bonus XP if you:**
- Know your D&D alignment with certainty.
- Have ever cried over a fictional relationship.
- Want to argue about MTG’s color pie over coffee.

Let’s write a story where we both get the happy ending. (*And maybe a few detours along the way*)

1kqrzm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/comments/1kqrzm5/new_book_idea/,new book idea,"Hello everyone, so I am an author and I currently working on my new book but it has been a while since I have asked fans or anyone really if they would like this to be a real book. So I would like to present to you guys this really short manuscript of the book so far. Now for background the book is a best friends to lovers in a way, and its two perspectives Main one is Erik Montero, and Rosalina Vega. Its a slowburn. And it would be in vignette sort of poetic style kinda. Let me know your thoughts on this and just general feedbacks. and if I should keep writing this. My literacy agent and editor don't really think this would be a good idea and is something people read now a days so just drop whatever thought you have short or small. these are the first 7 pages of the book.

For as long as I can remember, I believed I’d fall in love. Not like in fairy tales. Not even like in rom-coms. It wasn’t just something I wanted—it was something I needed.

There was this ache in me. A kind of longing. The kind you can’t explain, just feel. I saw it on TV: the slow-burn, best-friends-to-lovers type of love. The kind that pulls you in with all its tiny glances and missed chances. The guy in love with the girl who doesn’t even know it yet.

That’s the one that got me. That’s the one that felt real. Not the meet-cutes. Not bumping into each other at a coffee shop and falling in love by the second act. No. Mine was quieter. Slower. It was built like gravity.

The kind where the girl never suspects the guy likes her. Not because she couldn’t feel the same. But because it never even occurred to her that she could. She’s too close to him to see it. Too safe. Too used to his presence.

And then suddenly—it’s too late. He’s already halfway out the door, trying to let go of a hope he never should’ve held onto in the first place. And now she’s seeing him for the first time.

But by then… they’ve switched places. Now she’s chasing. And he’s the one pulling away.

And somehow— somehow that hurts more.

That’s what I wanted. Something that built over time. Something real. I didn’t chase it on purpose. It just lived in me. Quietly.

If we’re all going to die anyway… I just wanted to find someone who got me. Someone to grow old with. Someone who could see me, even when I didn’t say a word.

I thought I just liked love stories like that. But that wasn’t it. That wasn’t it at all. And maybe I never should’ve opened Pandora’s box.

I realized at a young age how uncommon that idea was. How foolish it sounded to most people.

I was seven at the dinner table. Fork in hand. Across from me was my mom laughing. My dad teased my older sister about something that didn’t interest me.

I was too busy thinking about the dream I had the night before.

I was in a knight costume.Riding a deep green dragon, with thick green wings shaped like leaves. Its eyes were the color of blood.

We flew toward a castle, but all I could see was its door. Everything else was covered in mist.

As we got closer, a window above the first floor came into view. The window was covered in ivy, with stems and tendrils raveling themselves around the frame. It was open, with mist curling out from within.

A voice could be heard. It was coming from the window. As I flew right into the window, mist covered my eyes and the last thing I heard was—

“Help me, Erik!”

I woke up right after.

As the dream slowly began to disappear from my mind, I realized that my parents had asked me a question.

“What?” I ask.

My dad takes a deep breath. “I said,"" What about you, Erik?”

“What about me?”

“What do you think love is?”

My sister laughs. “Like he’s going to know. I bet he’s still afraid of the dark.”

I shot my sister a look. “No I’m not!”

I look back at my dad and mom, who both seem to be waiting for my answer as if it was going to change the world.

“I think love is…”

I pause.

I think back to my dream, back to all the shows and movies I've watched, to all the tiny hints, piecing it all together in my head.

My parents watch me closely with curiosity. My sister looks at me every now and then from her phone with bored eyes.

I speak again. “It’s when you like someone so much you’d rather just be near them... even if they never know.”

Silence filled the room. Then a laugh came from my sister, followed by my parents’ faces filled with confusion, trying to understand if I was serious — or just pretending.

I went back to eating, drowning out anything my parents tried to come up with after.

They don’t understand. It doesn’t mean anything to them.

But that answer stuck with me.

The first time I felt anything close to that— was in elementary school.

I used to try to become best friends with any girl. In first grade, that was just normal. Everyone wanted to be everyone’s best friend.

But third grade… That’s when it hit differently.

There was this girl—Mariah Becca. She had these freckles that danced when she smiled. And she wore these purple square glasses that somehow made her face even softer. She was bright, and kind, and something about her made me want to stay around.

We were best friends. But to everyone else? We were “boyfriend and girlfriend.”

That’s when I learned about ships. People rooting for two people like they’re watching a story unfold. Because they see something. Something the two characters don’t even realize yet.

And the truth? They weren’t wrong.

Mariah and I leaned into the ship. We liked each other, but we didn’t stop being best friends. It was innocent—third grade love. But even then, it felt like more. There was this quiet connection between us.

No other crushes that year. No confusion. Just… us. Whatever that meant.

**Pan-romantic Ace and proud!** Emotional connection is my love language—physical stuff is strictly DLC, not base game. Ask me anything!

**Forever DM & LARPer**—If your ideal date involves:

- Rolling nat 20s on flirting checks.
- Debating whether ""Lawful Neutral"" is code for ""boring.""
- Overnight LARP events where we pretend we’re not freezing in a tent.
- Crying over fictional characters like it’s our job.…then congratulations, we’re already fanfic OTP material.

**Writer & Professional Story Goblin**—I hoard tropes, re-tellings, and character arcs like a dragon with a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Romance? Love is Blind scenarios? Fresh spins on classic tales? YES. (Bonus if you want to rant about them with me after.)

**Magic: The Gathering Commander Player**—I enjoy:

- Politicking my way to victory.
- ""Friendly"" games that last 4+ hours.
- Arguing whether counterspells are evil (they’re not; cry about it).

**Media Snob with a Heart of Gold**—I’ll tear apart a lazy comic adaptation with citations, but I’ll also cry at a well-done romance subplot. Fight me (or join me; your call.)

**Neuro-divergent mess**—Even simple concepts can confuse me. Will ask alot of clarifying questions even if they have obvious answers. Tend to repeat questions a day or week later due to fogetting.

**Trans Woman**—Proud, open, and living my best life. If that’s an issue, exit stage left before I cast ""Power Word: Cringe"" on you.

**No Casual Mentality**—I’m here for the epic romance arc, not a filler episode.

**Adventure or Bust**—I need someone who actually leaves the house. Yes, cozy nights are great, but if your idea of excitement is only marathon shows, we might not vibe. Road trips, Ren Faires, hiking, spontaneous day trips, or even just exploring weird little towns? Let’s go.

**Quest Completionist**—My main quest is to get seal it deal and adopt a child. If you do not want to eventually complete that quest with me, please do not ask to join my party.

# **Why I’m Objectively Awesome (According to Me & My Cat):**

- Officially dubbed **""The Most Adorable Human""** (*Source: My mirror. My cat. Peer-reviewed.*)
- **Empathetic listener + hype woman**—I’ll remember your niche hyper fixations and send you memes so specific, you’ll question reality.
- Matching Ren Faire/cosplay outfits? Done. Themed date nights? Obviously. Reading fanfic aloud dramatically? Already warming up my voice
- I will learn your ""useless"" fun facts and weaponize them later to make you smile.
- **My love language is physical touch**—translation: I cuddle like it’s my divine purpose.

# **Deal-Breakers (AKA ""Don’t Waste My Time""):**

- **Smoking/vaping or excessive drinking.**
- **Long-distance** outside driving range of **Northern Ohio** (*I’m flexible, but if flying is your only option, hard pass*).

I kinda had her as the center of everything, and now that we've split I'm hoping to find someone to chat with, and go exploring different parts of Toronto. After we chat for a bit, if you're comfortable, we can hop in the car and go check out different places. I'm not looking for a relationship. While, I've gotten over the ex a while ago, I've still got a lot of restructuring to do to get life back on track and I don't think I can be a proper significant other yet. I can definitely be there emotionally and mentally, so if you need someone to vent to, rant to, comfort and all that fun stuff - that I can do.

BUT, the point of this post, I'm been trying to get back in shape, got the weights down, but cardio and movement is being a pain in the ass. I find running and jogging boring. BUT, going for a walk and looking at random stuff, people watching, and all that, much more entertaining. Of course, it's also not only about the exercise, it also serves to get me out of the house. I've been getting cabin fever quite often lately. With that in mind, it doesn't always have to be about walking, we can just grab some coffee and chill, there's a few places I'd found a while ago that offer coffee AND boardgames.

Personality-wise: I would say I'm pretty chill, but also love laughing so I probably will say/do stupid shit for the giggles. I feel like I'm able to keep a good conversation going. Oh, speaking of conversation, feel free to speak as you please, and I'm an open book as well so feel free to jump to any topic that catches your curiousity.

Oh! I do smoke (I'm working on quitting), but sometimes the cravings hit a little harder. If it bugs you, I have no issue not smoking around you, if it's a REALLY bad craving, I may ask for a few mins and go off in a corner so you don't have to deal with the smoke :P.

Edit: Just remembered - I can drive, so if it's somewhere outside of Toronto, I can drive there (within reason - as fun as it would be, not driving to Niagra :P)....although...as a day trip, could be fun?

Also, I met a girl from a different school, let's call her Sofia. Anyway, when I was in 10th grade a new guy transferred to our school, let's call him John. John and I quickly became friends and ended up dating. At the start, all 3 girls seemed really happy for me, especially Sofia. 

After 6 months or so, John and I started fighting over small stuff and even broke up a couple times (for like a day lmfao). We later realized that it was due to family issues but anyway... I used to be a bit of a pushover so when John was upset with me about smth, it looked like he lectured me and someone even started a rumor that he was abusing me (which was not the case at all since then he has helped me learn how to stand up for myself). 

So after a year later, I noticed that Sofia and Hazel were becoming distant and canceling last minute when we planned to hang out the 4 of us. I thought it was odd so I asked Lily what that was about and she said that I spent too much time with John. Mind you, we shared a desk at school and we had many extracurricular together (which doesn't effect Sofia at all because she goes to a different school) and I never cancelled to hang out with him or brought him to our hangouts with the girls. 

After a while, all 3 stopped talking to me even tho I really tried to sort this out. I even dropped by Sofia's house (after calling her mom to make sure she was there and if it was alright to come over) to talk and she acted like nothing was wrong. Then, we went on a school trip where we stayed at a hotel. Lily and Hazel didn't wanna share a room with me so I stayed with some other girls from class. I talked to the girls I shared the room with about the situation, trying not to cry the whole time, and we had a good conversation.

After the trip Sofia was even more distant so I decided to pull the plag. I called her like 20 times and turns out she blocked my number. I texted her on social media and she said that she doesn't feel safe to go for a coffee out with me to talk and that she is so hurt about what I have done. I said I was also hurt because she wouldn't discuss the situation with me instead of avoiding me and then she blocked me on sm too.

I was so confused and hurt I went crying to my mom. My mom and Sofia's mom had also become friends so my mum called her and asked her what was wrong and 
TURNS OUT 
I had said something about Sofia to other people that hurt her deeply. But... I don't know what. Her mom said that they had crossed checked that it was true but she still wouldn't tell my mom what I had said. So yeah, about 2 years later I still have no clue what I said. I do think that I am better off now, but should I have tried to spend more time with them? Maybe I should have tried harder to resolve this.

Overall having a great time with the Profitec GO but am finding I need large doses to propery fill baskets.  I have a VST 20g and am needing to dose 25+g and that's just too much coffee for me.   I've ended up resorting to the stock double basket (14g listed I believe) and am using 18.5g.   only problem I have with that is it is tapered and has a much smaller surface area of holes.

I guess it doesn't really matter but I do kinda like the larger amount of holes and the more beautiful pulls along with straight edges.  Just feel like a constant depth puck is preferable to tapered?  Is that right?

Long story short, any basket recommendations that don't over caffeinate me and give relatively dry knock out pucks?

I matched with a girl on Friday night and we been chatting and I asked her for coffee this weekend and she replied saying she isn't free until mid July for Fridays and weekends due to work and mentioned she can do any weekday days or nights and I mentioned I could possibly do after five without putting a set date or anything as I was saying this yesterday without thinking and texted her this morning saying that nights probably won't work for me and the next day I have off is in three weeks and she mentioned she could possibly do said date but would need to confirm closer (which I totally get) and wasn't expecting this answer.

I am thinking about not replying and just letting it be as it may happen closer but right now I don't see it working but who knows what will happen and just let it be as it's not going to work any time soon and feel like she just wants to see me because she didn't say anything about not proceeding or anything she is also in her early 20s and me in my late 20s with five years apart.

I am asking advice on what I should do here and maybe I should just let it be as it is and put my efforts into someone else and just let the match sit without unmatching as I don't want to make any more conversation into her and all she said was that day may work just need to confirm closer so I don't know what I should say if any as I don't see this one working.",2,1747701063.0,Bumble,1,1.0,False

December returned a coffee maker that was malfunctioning that I bought for Christmas. Took out another credit card in a local bank with the same limit. Stopped using my credit card for all purchases and stopped buying anything from Amazon.

I know it has only been 5 months but I’m so proud that those rewards points are in the negative still. Will cancel my prime when it comes for renewal.

I spend SO much less money, I deleted all shopping apps from my phone so I don’t browse as much, and regularly go on social media breaks.
I couldn’t believe how much I was being advertised to until I stopped using them as much.

Now I- buy from manufacturers directly if I need something (and I spend time researching and thinking about it), get most things from local grocery stores, coops and drug stores. I have started using local groups to ask for things I normally would never do, and thrift shopping.

Target was about to get all my money after the inauguration but they flubbed that big time, I’m never going back there either.

1kqrnvw,https://i.redd.it/3ftytweozt1f1.jpeg,Student Workers On Strike at Dartmouth,"By Arnie Alpert, Active with the Activists

*Arnie Alpert spent decades as a community organizer/educator in NH movements for social justice and peace.  Officially retired since 2020, he keeps his hands (and feet) in the activist world while writing about past and present social movements.*

HANOVER—At 7:32 a.m. Monday morning, the Student Worker Collective at Dartmouth (SWCD) announced by email that it was going on strike at campus dining locations and residence halls.   Within 30 minutes, they were setting up a picket line and a “strike kitchen” outside Novack Café, a popular dining area and coffee shop located on the ground floor of the Baker Library, a central location on the Hanover campus. 

SWCD formed as an independent union in 2022 to represent undergraduate students employed in Dartmouth’s dining services.  Last year they organized another unit, representing Undergraduate Advisors, known at Dartmouth as UGAs and on most other campuses as Resident Advisors.  They won a $21/hour base wage and a grievance procedure in 2023 after threatening to go on strike, and according to the union, they also raised the campus minimum wage to $16.25. 

As the campus came to life, SWCD members taped signs on doors saying “SWCD ON STRIKE. THIS IS A PICKET LINE. DO NOT CROSS.”   Carrying signs with slogans like “Dartmouth Works Because We Do,” they explained their demands to people entering or leaving the building and asked them to support the union by boycotting Novack.  Responses were generally positive.  They also offered pastries, bagels, and coffee, laid out on a table in the doorway.  

A union activist said SWCD includes about 200 dining service workers and 100 UGAs.  The college has about 4500 undergrads. 

After a short talk with one of the strikers, Brian Akin said he normally eats at Novack every weekday but will honor the picket line as long as the strike goes on.  “I think that they are the backbone of cafe locations like this. And I just want to make sure that I’m supporting them and their endeavors,” he told me as he rushed off to class.

With student workers on strike, union members said the café was short-staffed. By 8 a.m., messages were circulating that the café would close early all week.  And the Baker Café, inside the library and normally open until evening, was shut down by 10 a.m.    

Looking back on the 2023 campaign, the union said, “Today, our fight is even bigger,” in its early morning email.  “We are negotiating a second contract for dining workers and our first contract for UGAs, or residential advisors. We are up against hostile lawyers on six-figure salaries, formerly employed at union-busting firm Jackson Lewis, as we independently crafted contract language and self-taught labor law between classes, lunch breaks, and on our weekends. Some of Dartmouth’s tactics have included: refusing to provide contract clauses prior to bargaining sessions, joining negotiating sessions late and leaving early, using aggressive and volatile language, and of course, denying contract extensions, which has culminated in our current reality—without a contract, and with our backs pushed against the wall.”

College officials have a different narrative.  According to a statement from Jana Barnello, the college’s Director of Media Relations and Strategic Communications “Dartmouth gave careful consideration to all of SWCD’s proposals and counter proposals, and we believe the last, best, and final contracts offered for both dining workers and UGAs reflect the values and priorities raised at the table. The contracts represent areas of meaningful compromise and a fair, responsible, and respectful outcome of our shared work.”

Talks broke down in late April, when the college submitted what it called its final proposal and refused union demands to continue negotiations.  The union then submitted its own final proposal, voted to reject the college’s offer, and voted to authorize a strike. 

The union and management each have charts showing their own side of the argument, which the union says have major differences in three areas: wages, automation, and keeping immigration agents off campus.   

On wages, the differences appear to be minor.  Both sides support a base wage of $23, with the college offering to raise it by 3% each year and the union demanding a raise that matches the increase in tuition rates, which they say tops the rate of inflation.

Dartmouth says, “no student dining worker jobs will be eliminated due to automation.”  The union maintains that 2 snack bars have already been shut down at the cost of 20 jobs, and that they want stronger protection in the future.

As for immigration enforcement, a thorny issue at a time when the Trump administration has forcibly arrested international students on other campuses and sought to terminate student visas, the college says it will work with “appropriate legal counsel to determine whether the presence of an immigration enforcement agent is lawful before any action is taken” and that it will protect the privacy and rights of international students, “in accordance with all applicable laws.”

The union is not satisfied with the administration’s position, especially the proposal that union members call Dartmouth security or the Office of Visa and Immigration Services if they see ICE agents on campus.  “What we are pushing for,” said Harper Richardson, a UGA, “is that Dartmouth will not willfully and voluntarily provide immigration or personal information about the residence or location of any student worker, so that we can ensure that our UGAs have the utmost security from interactions with ICE.”

Another point of contention is that the new head of the office which oversees international students is a former attorney for the Republican National Committee, who the union members see as a Trump ally.  They are distrustful, too, of campus security officers who arrested dozens of students peaceably protesting the Gaza war a year ago at the behest of the university president.   

Mingwei Huang, an assistant professor in the Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program, stopped by the picket line to show her support.  “I believe students, faculty, staff, run the university, not the administration. We are the people who make up the university. I support student workers. I also support faculty and staff labor,” she said, adding that the university has been “pretty hostile” throughout the SWCD negotiations.

That’s a view held, as well, by the Rev. Gail Kinney, who leads the NH Faith and Labor Alliance and was on picket duty bright and early Monday.  Kinney, an observer at a negotiating session in April, reported in an email that “after not meaningfully discussing the students’ written proposals and then presenting the College’s already-written ‘last, best and final offer,’ the College then (four days later) refused to hold further negotiations or to extend the now-expired SWCD contract despite SWCD requests otherwise. Bad Faith, indeed!”  Kinney has put out the call for union supporters to join SWCD on the picket line.  

Whether the college will return to the bargaining table is unclear, which means the strike will continue for the foreseeable future.  For Klaire Theall, a UGA who also has a second campus job while studying environmental engineering, being on strike means she’ll stop doing most of what UGAs are expected to do, like going to staff meetings and responding to minor residence hall incidents.  If something’s broken, she said she’d tell students in her dorms to complain to the college, not to her.  If it’s something more serious, though, she won’t abandon students in need.    “I’m just going to tell them, hey, I’m on strike,” she said.  “If you need anything, don’t call me. But if you, like, *really* need anything, you can let me know.”

A separate union representing Dartmouth grad students went on strike for three months last year before reaching a contract agreement.

Picketing began at 8 a.m. Monday, with members signed up for 2-hour shifts.  The union says it will picket at Novack from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. each weekday and has asked professors to consider holding classes at the picket line.  They are also planning a rally later this week and a fundraiser on Saturday.  The union has already received a substantial donation from the student government to support their strike kitchen. ",3,1747700778.0,dartmouth,0,0.71,False
1kqrntd,https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1kqrntd/pseudo_obvious_tips_to_improve_accuracy_with_mg/,Pseudo obvious tips to improve accuracy with MG,"I was a loyal Garmin Fenix 3 with an HRM run chest strap user for 5 years. After hundreds of hours staring at my heart rate on my handlebars while mountain biking, I could guess my heart rate to within 2-3 bpm just based on how I was feeling. I moved over to Whoop 1.5 y ago and found that the heart rate during activities like strength training, running, and day to day activities were not always in alignment with what I would expect based on how I was feeling. I did, however, find that my sleep metrics, health monitor stats, and recovery numbers were very reflective of how I was feeling each morning. I will confess that I have not been wearing my whoop 4.0 exactly where it should be. In anticipation of my new Whoop MG, I made a decision to start wearing my strap exactly where it was recommended to be worn. I can put a full 2 fingers between my wrist bone and the Whoop. I also discovered that I did, however, need to shift my Whoop further away from the side closest to my thumb. The reason being is when I would rotate my wrist, I could see a gap between my skin and the Whoop itself. So I shifted my Whoop away from my thumb until it laid flat against my skin without creating an air gap when I rotated my wrist.

My hypothesis for why the accuracy improved is that the sensors meant to pickup the green light were occasionally catching flashes of ambient light caused by the air gap and screwing with the numbers. My second hypothesis is that spacing the whoop further away from the wrist bone and further away from the thumb, positions it closer to the posterior interosseous artery.

So, I know it's kinda weird to do and honestly it takes double checking from time to time, but your accuracy really will be better if you wear the strap in the proper place. Is it a chest strap? No, but you've put money down to have a Whoop, might as well give it the best chance it can to be accurate.

The new Whoop MG is way way more accurate. Even when running I can finally trust my numbers. WOW! Thank goodness. This is huge Whoop, congrats!

I recently received my Whoop MG and immediately calibrated the blood pressure using a BP cuff I bought on Amazon. I did discover using that cuff that my numbers were way off from what they usually were in the doctors office which spurred me into a panic that I had high blood pressure. Let me save you the heart attack I had. Taking a blood pressure using a machine at home is dependent upon MANY factors. You can really screw it up if you don't follow this to a T. So if you are trying to calibrate your MG, take the time and do this right. Follow every last detail it tells you in the guide when doing the cuff. If you don't, don't bother because it won't be accurate. My first measurement was in the 140/85 region when I didn't do every single bullet below, and now it's 110/65 which matches my doctor's office. I have been measuring for the last 3 days, 3 measurements per day and the numbers only vary by 2.

1. Get a good cuff. Save yourself the time and frustration and buy an Omron Iron. It's $38 and it has the same exact sensor as it does in their hospital units, just with way less features.
2. Wake up, go to the restroom, and take your BP. Do not drink water, coffee, chat with people. Just go straight to taking your BP. Avoid all the other scenarios Whoop tells you to avoid as well.
3. Sit in a chair at a table that isn't so high that you feel like you're sitting at the bar, more so the table is at the height of your heart.
4. Keep both feet flat on the floor.
5. SIT UP STRAIGHT! This one changed my BP a full 10 points on systolic. If you slouch, it moves your arm higher which gives more resistance to your heart which raises the reading.
6. Be quiet.
7. Tighten your cuff just enough where you can slide it on and off without removing the velcro.
8. Use your index and pointer fingers to feel for your brachial artery. Position the little dot on your BP cuff for where the artery is supposed to be and put the cuff there. The cuff should be 1 finger width away from the wrinkled crease on the inside of your elbow.
9. Palm should be up so someone could put a baseball in your hand and it would stay.
10. Put your other arm on the table and push the button to start the test and relax while it's taking the measurement.",3,1747700770.0,whoop,1,1.0,False

My husband and I are 28, and we have no pets or children. We plan to have children, but we would be fine in an apartment for a while. 

We have lived in an apartment about a mile from King Street and off the GW Parkway in Alexandria for almost a year. We are currently deciding between renting a home in the Holmes Run Acres neighborhood, which is beautiful and surrounded by nature, or moving into a different apartment in our complex. 

Why this is so hard for me is that I have pretty severe depression and a chronic illness. Our apartment is pretty dark, small, and expensive, but we are in a perfect location. The home we’re looking at renting is more affordable for way more space, very quaint, and the neighborhood is beautiful. Surrounded by parks. It would be nice to have a backyard and plenty of windows to open. Renting also takes away the costs associated with owning a home. 

Being in an apartment complex forces me to interact with others, even if I’ve been isolating myself in bed. We can go to trivia nights and have a coffee shop below us. My psychiatrist is next door, and everything we need is within walking distance. 

I would definitely take more walks and spend more time in nature in this house, but it would limit my human interaction, and we’d have to drive everywhere (as expected in suburbia). The neighborhood seems like a great community, but there seem to be a lot of families with children. 

We both have cars, but my husband works at the coast guard HQ, and doesn’t have a parking space or carpool for work. I lost my job recently and am about to start looking again. 

We don’t have family in the state (we're from NC/SC), and it’s hard to host friends and family now if they were to visit. A house seems more fun to work on and decorate. We don’t have any super interesting hobbies that we need more space for. I would like to get into gardening!

1kqrhnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/enlightenment/comments/1kqrhnz/on_the_ego_and_being_troubled/,On the Ego and Being Troubled,"On the Ego and Being Troubled 

Lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of posts and people on these subreddits talk about “ego death” and the desire and means to get there. 

This is greatly disturbing to me and I’ve decided that I would be remiss if I didn’t even try to tell you all WHY this is disturbing. 

One cannot come to peace through war. Killing One’s ego is an act of warfare against yourself, and it’s an un-winnable war. A spiritual war conducted against ourselves. The ego is just as constant, just as immortal as you are. And it HAS to be. It’s the interface for experience. 

Anyone who thinks this is a good idea hasn’t thought through the implications of doing so. If the ego truly dies, so does common sense and self preservation. 
You no longer care about wearing protective gear when you hop on your motorbike or slow down before taking corners, you blow up all the relationships in your life because you don’t care whose feelings you hurt or who’s heart you break. 

Killing your ego is a faulty and dangerous premise. This life isn’t about killing off parts of ourselves and then expecting ourselves to be whole. That’s insane. The ego isn’t your enemy, it’s the Guardian at the Gate. An overzealous Bodyguard.

We’d all be much better served if we invited our egos for a coffee date and check in weekly. Have real conversations…things like “Ok Dude, I can’t have you screaming ‘INTRUDER ALERT’ every time someone asks how you’re doing. What do you need to fix this?”  And then listen. 

Nothing is about killing off parts of ourselves…it IS all about integration. Trusting ourselves with ourselves that we have our best intentions in mind and act like it. 

So much of the outer conflict we see in the world today is a direct reflection of how people operate with themselves and it seems like every one is at war. We believe our thoughts to be “real”, we believe lies that in order to be happy we have to carve ourselves into pieces. This is the way to psychosis and mental illness. It’s not the way to the truth of who you are. 

Making friends with yourself is though. Asking what your needs are and really caring and listening to what’s being echoed back is that. Respecting and loving ourselves enough to stop the cycle of self destruction is that. 


You’re not broken because you have an ego

You’re not failing because you flinch when someone gets too close or asks too many questions.

 That’s just your inner guard dog doing its job. 

Maybe it’s a little twitchy from past battles. Maybe it barks too loud. 

But it’s not trying to ruin your life…it’s trying to protect it.

And yeah, it can overstep.

It gets dramatic….

But the answer isn’t to kill it…

The answer is to TRAIN it.

 Teach it some better manners. 

Offer it snacks. 

Set boundaries. 

Make it a weekly check-in buddy instead of an unhinged security system.

“Killing your ego” is just another way we’ve been taught to go to war with ourselves and call it spiritual.

But healing isn’t war.

Healing is integration.

It’s getting the boardroom of your being to sit down at the same damn table and figure out how to work together for once. 

The truth is, the world doesn’t need more people who’ve severed pieces of themselves and think that’s enlightenment…

The world needs whole people, folks who’ve sat with their shadows, hugged their inner toddlers, fed their egos something besides fear, and STAYED.

So no, I don’t want to kill my ego. That would be hell. 

I want to teach it how to exhale.

To stop yelling and barking  every time someone knocks on the door.

To walk beside me like a trusted friend, not drag me into fights that I never wanted in the first place. 

Because I’m not here to be divided, I’m here to be whole. 

I’m here to be a sanctuary for myself first, so that I can be the authentic wonderfully weird God spark that I can manage to be for myself and others. 

And the next time someone tells me I need to kill my ego to find peace,
I know now what to say; 

“We shouldn’t kill our messengers, we should give them new assignments.”

I tried starting with hot water and cold water, tap water and filtered water. But it just keeps producing this awful tasting metallic coffee.

Could it be because this was the cheaper option available so maybe they used not so good quality metal? Is it time to toss it and buy a better one? It was working perfectly until a few days ago.

I know now that love is not merely an intense attraction or admiration for another, but a choice. A choice that will be challenged and a choice that one must make even when the worst parts of ourselves see the light of day. A choice that both lovers must always be prepared to make. A choice to commit, to compromise, to celebrate successes, to communicate concerns. A choice is not what I understood love to be when I chased adoration & validation from others. Our last conversation didn’t go as we hoped it would, I know. I didn’t want to turn to look at you as you walked away. A piece of me still clings onto hope that we’ll see each other again someday. Maybe even just walking in & out of a coffee shop, a slight smile as we remember our memories together and continue our day. That piece of me doesn’t want to let go of what we had, that doesn’t know how, that doesn’t want to or know how to start over, that looks for you in everything, everywhere at every opportunity, that is excited to share things with you but can’t. That piece I lay bare now.

I don’t regret loving you, even when I find myself thinking of the moments we shared and crying.

""Hematite.""

I looked up from my laptop, researching some neat stuff on dark oxygen. My usual group of college students weren't here tonight, Jenna was throwing some sort of party but I'd politely bowed out. It was starting well before sundown, and I'd rather get the recap than explain why I only ever showed up after dark.

The woman who slid into the booth across from me was pretty, Arabic, and looked older than my usual crowd. Her hair was dyed blue, but with how dark her hair was naturally, you could only tell when the light hit it right.

Funny how the vegetarians only triggered my Highlander vibes when they wanted to, and she loved to surprise me.

""Heya Peach."" I closed my laptop with a smile. ""Digging the hair. Pulling the student act like me?""

She shook her head. ""Polycule."" She only grinned more in the brief second that I struggled with the word. ""Like a harem, only there's no actual harem leader. And more than one guy. They tend to be alt in one way or another, so I'm fitting in.""

I nodded, grinning a little. ""Not bad thinking. How's that working out for you?""

""Pretty good. There's only two humans, but they're really just there for the paperwork to fit in. One of ours is even an entomologist."" She took a long draw on her smoothie.

I raised my eyebrows. ""Nice. I might have to do some research on that.""

""Well, if you ever want to give it a shot, you know my usual haunts. We might even find a place for one like you in there.""

I grinned a bit, leaning back in my seat as I reached for my coffee. ""Mmmm, we'll see when you tell me why you're here.""

Inaya couldn't help but grin despite herself. ""You're too clever, old man. I need some advice.""

That was usually the reason why any of us, no matter their diet, came to me about. I motioned for her to continue as I sipped my coffee.

""I don't know if you've seen it, but prices keep going up, and it's getting... harder to sustainably keep ourselves going. Not without drawing attention. Going to the same grocery stores, day in and day out. These help..."" She lifted her smoothie. ""...but they're harder to get after a certain time of night.""

The bug eaters had an easier time than the rest of us, so long as it wasn't winter. They basically had to starve themselves. Many also had pet reptiles, but again, that just took the edge off. Most who talked to me, I'd advised to tell folks that they got real bad seasonal depression. It was the easiest explanation as they got more lethargic.

I didn't bother asking if she had a garden; of *course* she had a garden, even if it was a planter box. I wouldn't dare insult a cousin like that.

""The downside of modern urban life. And jelly just doesn't hit the same.""

She made a face. ""With what they do it it? Blah, no.""

I smirked a little, knowing the feeling, but in different ways. But that smirk quickly turned sympathetic. ""I'm not really sure that I can help you, though. I'm--""

""I'm not asking for me,"" she said quickly. ""If you wanted, you'd be the lord of the region. Not just the master of the city, the *lord*. And at least half of us have been working together, trying to find an... elegant solution to this.""

That made my eyebrows raise. ""At least 200?"" Her look of surprise made me give her a look. While I wasn't sure that I could be more than the master vampire of the city, it didn't mean that I didn't keep track of every single vampire in the region. Just because I didn't engage with politics anymore didn't mean that I didn't keep my finger on the lack of pulse in the region.

But I sighed, pressing the pad of my thumb between my brow. ""Okay. In the short term, suffer.""

To her credit, she looked like she expected that answer. Inaya was many things, and some that I didn't particularly like, but she wasn't stupid. She knew that a little misery now for a payout later was the best way for our kind.

""You all have been going about the community garden thing all wrong. It's a good idea, don't get me wrong, but how you're trying to get it done is wrong. You aren't going to get the land that you need by focusing on the community level. And even then, that'll just give you an edge in the short term.

""But the short term edge for almost 500 of you in the city still has a great impact. So, let me start at the top. I'll need you to find your best mesmers to introduce to me. At least... three who excel at sorcerery, too. Maybe more. I need to compose a list of targets and exactly what ideas you're going to have to implant into their heads. And when you're going to do this. Because those sorcerers are going to have to set up some accidents first. This is going to have to be a very, very targeted and well-planned operation. But I should be able to come up with a way to get more, and better, community gardens by the end of the month. The second part of my plan is to actually push fresh fruit more heavily in schools, and they're going to need more funding. Again, how you failed last time was approach, not in spirit. You had the right idea, you just didn't target their funding first. I can personally handle that. There's enough humans who still cower at the sight of my face that I can pull that off. But while you won't get the bonus of pollination, which I'll never understand why you lot love that so much, you'll at least get the fruit that isn't eaten a few days before it goes bad. I'll make it happen.""

She smiled warmly and bowed her head. ""Thank you.""

""Don't thank me yet."" My tone had taken a dangerous turn. I adjusted my tuque before steepling my fingers. ""If I do this for you, all of you are going to owe me. Nothing so grandiose as a blood debt or anything, but a favor will be owed by all. And I want an agreement from all of you on that.""

I still had it. Her demeanor changed in seconds. Thankful to rejecting to contemplative. After a few more seconds, she narrowed her eyes. ""How big of a favor?""

Now it was my turn to grin. ""Your polycule be the first to pay. I need an out-of-town girlfriend to show up for the entirety of spring break. Go to clubs with me, hang out at my apartment, hang out here. Play up the out of town girlfriend act. Long distance relationship sort of thing. If she's one of yours, I'll handle the fruit cost while she's here. I may not have too much longer that I can keep up the act with this college, but I'm drawing suspicion from the kine ever since I let slip that, no, I'm not asexual. If I don't produce an out-of-town girlfriend over spring break, they'll start trying to hook me up, and that will only get more complicated.

""Help me maintain my masquerade, and I'll consider your whole polycule in the clear. That is the level of favor that I'm requesting.""

The vegetarians outnumbered my kind almost three to one. Even with this level of favor, that still gave me significant power should I need it. And if there's one thing that a vampire over a hundred learned, it was that favors were the most precious commodity of them all.

Inaya pulled out her phone and messed around on it for a moment before pushing it across the table to me. The woman on the screen wasn't unattractive, but wouldn't appear on any magazines. ""My progeny. So long as you give her some time to spend with me as well, I wouldn't mind an excuse to see her again.""

I, at the time (25f), applied for a job at a chiropractic office as an assistant.  I had a great interview with the doctor. He explained the duties and expectations.   I took over the position from another woman who moved on to working in the billing department.   One of the things she did for the doc every morning was to prepare him a cup of coffee and leave it on his desk.  On my first day she approached me and delegated the task to me.   Apparently she said it's not her job anymore.  I was a bit of a hot head in that era of my life and declined her pawning off her coffee duties on me.  I made sure to do a good job assisting the Dr.  The job was fun and the patients were sweet.  

One morning the Dr asked about his coffee and I feigned ignorance. I was all, What,I don't know how to make coffee, I don't even drink it myself. Surely, you wouldn't want coffee from me. Well, that ticked the former assistant off and she again pressed me later in the day to make his coffee in the morning.

That afternoon a sweet little elderly woman came in for her treatment. Let's call her,  Mrs Hufflepuff.  Apparently, Mrs Hufflepuff farted on the good Dr when he pressed on her back. It was the double trouble kind, the loud AND stinker.  After he finished her adjustment and she departed, I entered the room to prepare for the next patient and almost gagged.  He wasn't happy about the gas bomb.

The next morning I skipped the coffee per usual and prepared the rooms for the patients.  When he arrived and realized his coffee wasn't there, he called for his old assistant to asked why.  At this point I'm digging in my heels.  I wasn't hired to make coffee. 

A bit later he called me in and asked why there wasn't something warm and aromatic waiting for him in his office when he arrived. I said,  ""Mrs Hufflepuff left him something warm and aromatic in his office the day before and he didn't appreciate it. ""  He laughed and said nothing else. I walked into the front office and the former assistant looked at me smuggly and said,  you ARE going to make the coffee.   By this time it was lunch so i left and decided not to go back.

I always snarl whenever I see the rich vampire trope in fiction. Vampires didn't turn nobility or rich merchants because it draws too much attention. You don't mesmerize them into giving you gobs of cash for the same reason -- family realizes something's up, they investigate, and eventually you have a lynch mob coming after you. Who wants that?

No, the people who you turn are the diamonds in the rough who otherwise might never be given a chance. Like me! I was a peasant, just barely a Roman citizen, who spent a year with quickly degrading sleep, but dreamed of deep philosophical debates. My family probably thought I ran off to be a bard of something.

Well, in a way I did. I spent another five years before I was turned.

Those years were, in many ways, miserable. Today? Not so much.

I adjusted my tuque on my head, nodding along as one of my late-night companions bitched at another about them reading Ayn Rand of all things, picking apart her philosophy. Not well, my you, she was fumbling some of her arguments and wasn't saying anything that I hadn't heard before, but her passion was exquisite.

I sipped the iced coffee that Advik had bought me. He was from rich stock in India and was far too free with his money. I was pretty sure that if I asked him right, I wouldn't even have to mesmerize him to get him to buy me a car. Not lease or anything, straight up buy. I'd gotten good at identifying his type and getting in good with them. The insufferable arrogance of money, but a useful pawn.

Apparently, not having a lot of money confused a lot of those we turned. They thought that we'd invested in the stock market or something ages ago and were living off it. Ha! As if. Some of us attached ourselves as friends to the wealthy, but wealth ourselves? In the modern day? Heavens no! That invited *taxes* which invited *audits* which invited investigation into our history. No, no thank you.

No, it was far better to make college students think you were one of their peers. The moneybags before Advik had bought me a phone. A few months ago, I'd mentioned that my laptop had broken and the next day I'd been given a hand me down. It wasn't the best, showing a bit of age, and a chromebook, but I could watch youtube, browse reddit and wikipedia, and work on ""papers"" that helped me fit in more. During the weekends, I'd get some solid meals in, enough to tide me over during the week. Even during finals, *someone* is hitting the clubs. Easy peasy. During the week? It was all nighters at the coffee shop, either chatting with students or enjoying the internet. If Advik wasn't around, a quick glance would get me something to drink and a snack so I'd fit in.

I was about to make a comment when I had a total Highlander moment, feeling the other vampire before I ever saw him. My eyes glanced up, only for a frown to form on my lips as I saw Charles. In Armani. Couldn't he at least *try* to fit in? We made eye contact before he moved into the bathroom. Grand.

I entered a minute after him, locking the door behind me and putting my hands on my hips. ""What?""

He looked nearly in a panic. ""I just got a letter from the IRS.""

Remember how I said that we avoided that? Yeah, those of us who were smart. Charles was turned because he looked pretty. Himbo, I think the term is these days. I'm pretty good at keeping up with the slang, but sometimes things slip through the cracks. Fortunately, I can send someone that And I'm Afraid To Ask meme and they'll help.

I sighed heavily. ""I'm surprised it took so long.""

He shook his head quickly. ""What do I do?""

""Liquidate everything, burn it all down, I'm being literal with that one, move to the other end of the country, and *don't do anything that might draw attention to the feds!*""

That only made him more concerned. ""How am I supposed to get another condo?""

With a sigh, I placed my hands on his shoulders. ""My old friend. I want you to understand that I mean this as a friend, and not to insult you. My kinship to you is like the ocean; ever since we fended off those hunters in the fifties, I have seen you as family without the blood. And it's only this kinship that keeps me from walking out of here right now to leave you to fend for yourself.

""You don't get a condo. You burn through the cash that you have -- no banks -- by finding someone renting out their basement. They won't mind cash so long as you keep your nose clean. Mesmerize people into giving you $20 a night, maybe more depending on rent. I suggest pimps or drug dealers. They usually have rolls of twenties in their pocket. Someone different every night, too, if you do the same one too regularly you end up drawing attention. Make a small nest egg, but do pay your rent, don't feed on your landlord, and remember sacred hospitality. Tell them that you work nights at a gas station, and for goodness sake, dress the part! No more suits! Hoodies are more comfortable anyway.

""Ditch the beemer, get a car from someone who's selling on Craiglist or something where you can deal in cash. Come by in a couple of days, I have some new tricks for registering a car and your license. I'll print out directions for you. No more banks, cash is your friend. You need to lower your standard drastically, my friend.""

He looked shaken. I was the eldest in town; not the master vampire in town, though I could if I wanted. But I was telling him to abandon his entire way of life. Not an easy thing; he never learned to be agile like I was. ""I don't think I can live like you.""

""You have to. The hunters are getting smarter. They use technology and bureaucrats against us. They don't need to actively seek us out, they just need to find the trends... like yours. You can either live like I do, a life of discovery and self-enrichment and destitution, or... you can be ash."" I gave him a gentle pat on the shoulder. ""You should have a few weeks before they narrow all the data and come for you, but you need to be out of town by then. I'll type up everything that you need to know within two days. Okay?""

He nodded.

""Excellent. Now, one thing...""

A few minutes later, I was settling back down in the booth. Julie gave me the side eye. ""$20 is $20?""

I snorted. ""I ain't turnin' tricks. He somehow skipped a pre-req and needed tutoring. I was a poor freshman who could read the damn books. Good money, but ever since he graduated he comes to me whenever he has a problem. All good."" I opened my laptop. ""Just need to write up some stuff for him. But...""

I laid a few crisp $20s on the table, grinning from ear to ear. ""It means that the next coffee's on me.""",1,1747699789.0,RiticWrites,0,1.0,False

I work with people (sometimes the tiny kind, sometimes the chaotic kind) and it’s a job that’s taught me empathy, patience, and how to survive on zero sleep and too much coffee.

I’m an introvert by nature but warm up fast. Once I feel comfortable, I go from quiet thinker to “here’s a playlist I made that accidentally tells you too much about me.”



Here’s what keeps me going:

* Music – My playlists go from soft indie ballads to aggressive boss battle themes and then back to lo-fi in under 3 tracks.
* Movies – I’ll happily dissect a masterpiece or watch the worst rom-com on Netflix just for fun. Bonus points if you can quote bad dialogue with a straight face.
* Gaming – I lean toward story-rich single-player adventures, but if you want to team up for something chaotic and hilarious, I’m in.
* Books & Writing – I love getting lost in good fiction or oddly specific Wikipedia holes. I write when I can, even if it’s mostly half-finished Google Docs for now.
* Creative things – Drawing, brainstorming, daydreaming. I'm in my “figure-it-out” era and loving the process.
* Curiosity – I will absolutely watch a 40-minute video essay on a topic I’ll forget by next week—but I’ll be very passionate about it in the moment.



Who I’m Hoping to Meet:

I don’t have a long list or a rigid “type.” Honestly, I just want to talk to someone kind, curious, and open-minded—someone who wants to connect beyond “wyd.”

Bonus points if:

* You enjoy silly, deep, or totally random conversations (or all three in one sitting).
* You’re a fan of movie nights, music swaps, or virtual hangouts.
* You can handle sarcasm, witty banter, and occasional existential spirals at ungodly hours.
* You’re open to a relationship if the vibe’s right, and maybe even the idea of a family someday (no rush, no pressure—just openness).
* You’re cool with exchanging pics when it feels natural, not weird.
* You’re down to move to another chat platform if Reddit starts feeling like a weird third wheel.



Why Message Me?

* Because you’re tired of talking to bots, dry texters, or people who vanish mid-convo.
* Because you want someone who actually reads your replies.
* Because you want to connect with someone who listens, laughs, and is willing to see where things go.
* Because you're secretly a cat in human form. Or you just like cats. That works too.



At the very least, we might have a fun, thoughtful chat. At best? Well... let’s not spoil the ending just yet.

Shoot your shot—I'm friendly, I reply, and I promise to bring good vibes (and probably a meme or two).",1,1747699520.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

That’s right—I’m assembling a squad. If you’ve ever screamed internally while pretending to be normal, accidentally trauma-dumped on a new friend, or spent six hours hyperfixating on your D&D character’s tragic backstory… this post is for you.

A bit about me:
I’m turning 30 this year (cue dramatic music) and have been on a journey of self-discovery, healing, and figuring out how to build a life that feels actually good™. Been leveling up in therapy, investing stat points into self-love, and finally learned how to make a breakfast that isn’t just coffee and vibes.

But despite all that, I’ve realized something’s missing—people. My people. Fellow weirdos.
So here I am, casting Summon Internet Friends at 9th level.

Looking for:
	•	Fellow queer, neurodivergent, artistic goblins
	•	People who like to talk regularly, whether it’s deep convos, chaotic memes, or “look at this cursed item I just found in Baldur’s Gate”
	•	Creatives! I’m a writer—if you draw, paint, write, or cosplay, let’s trade inspo!
	•	Bonus points if you’re into D&D, TTRPGs, cozy/indie games, or just screaming about your OC’s trauma arc at 2am
	•	Furries welcome—if you have a sona, I already want to know everything about them
	•	Age range: ideally 25-35ish, but 21+ is the only hard rule. Any time zone is cool with me if it’s cool with you.

I’m not expecting overnight besties, but I am hoping to build real, long-term friendships. The kind where we accidentally stay up till 4am talking about life, drop hype in each other’s inboxes, and maybe even co-write chaotic worldbuilding lore for no reason other than fun.

If you made it this far, you’re probably at least a little weird. So what are you waiting for? Slide into my DMs like a bard with maxed-out Charisma and zero impulse control.

Let’s make magic together ✨

1kqr4hv,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/1kqr4hv/my_snl50_cast_ranking/,My SNL50 Cast Ranking,"This is my order of who I enjoyed on the show this season and, if Billy Martin set fire to Studio 8H a la Season 11 (which I think is needed), who I'd save from the fire.

Ashley Padilla  
(MVP - Paul Mescal, Timothee Chalamet, Shane Gillis, Lady Gaga, Mikey Madison)  
It’s hard to know what kind of trajectory a featured player is going to have. Ashley started off having as much, or as little, airtime as a common newbie, but still showed potential in the few parts she was given. She had the trajectory of your average featured player, but as the season reached the 2nd half, she became my favorite cast member. It was so refreshing seeing what a great actor she is and how committed she can play a character, unlike many of the vets. I’m not sure how many people would put her this high, and I could've swapped the next two for any place in the top 3, but I just keep wanting to see her more.   
Best: her laughing in the Eyeliner Commercial was maybe my favorite moment this season, plus her parts in Jokes, the only good part of Domingo, Pasta Commercial, and Jury Duty.  
Worst: weirdly, I wasn't crazy about Joann. I wish I could say it was either her performing or the writing, but sometimes they were both great and sometimes they were both lacking.  
Would I save her from the fire? Hell yeah! 

Andrew Dismukes  
(MVP - Charli xcx, Chris Rock, Jack Black, Jon Hamm)  
It took a while for me to respect Dismukes like I do now. I didn’t think much of him in 47, thought he was okay in 48, then he became one of my favorites in 49. This year, he was usually the best part of a bad sketch and knew how to be a good scene stealer.   
Best: Devo Hat is probably my Andrew highlight. His fajitas were the only part of Real Housewives that kept me interested, his straight man in Coach Allen, and all his parts in Snakeskin, Calling Dad, Bald Man, Jury Duty, Stand Up Gangster, and Love Match.  
Worst: I didn’t see much of an impression in his Springsteen but he was still funny, I also enjoyed him as Shroeder but felt bad how little he was given, I didn't care for his Puppet bit on Update, but the worst part was him as DOUCHE in that cold open.  
Would I save him from the fire? Totally. 

James Austin Johnson  
(MVP - Ariana Grande, Bill Burr)  
James gave me hope for the show once I saw him dominate his first episode in 47. Over the past 3 years, he’s been my favorite cast member. This season wasn’t a great display of his talents. He still had great moments and is very high on this list.   
Best: Hard to pick a highlight as I liked him in Washington’s Dream, NASA, Snakeskin, the Scottish guy in CFT Irish Pub, Jury Duty, Stand Up Gangster, 2nd Amendment, but his perfect shining moment was him in the Hotel Detective sketch.  
Worst: It would be too easy to say Trump, even though he does the impression better than anyone, I’m just over parodying him, especially when he just kept showing up in the cold open for no reason, but instead I’ll give his worst moment to his Noel Gallagher impression, which was a weak bit and his weakest impression.   
Would I save him from the fire? Yeah. He’s got a lot to offer.  

Ego Nwodim  
(MVP - Michael Keaton, Scarlett Johansson)  
Ego is a vet who I’m still not tired of because she’s a better actor than any of them. Usually, like Andrew, she's the best part of any bad sketch.  
Best: She saved that awful Charli xcx Talk show as Jasmine Crockett, also loved her in Jury Duty, Goth Kid on Vacation, not looking at cue cards during Group Message Opening (Sarah…), but her best moment was definitely Miss Eggy.  
Worst: The only sketch I didn't really like her in was Think About It.  
Would I save her from the fire? For sure! If I had to keep one vet, it would be Ego. 

Michael Longfellow  
(MVP - John Mulaney)  
After having a great first season, followed by a sophomore slump, Longfellow had a pretty decent third year. His deadpan cynical tone gives me life. While he might not have much range, I just always want the show to find ways to use him.   
Best: He had lots of good moments this year. Waterslide was for sure one of his best moments on the show, he was good opposite Mikey Madison in So Like What Are We?, and he was the best part of Bungee Class.  
Worst: I don't think I ever disliked Longfellow. I was so excited to see a Bill Hader cameo in What’s That Name that when I saw Longfellow I got mad, but he did a good enough job. But I felt bad for him dressed as Shrek.  
Would I save him from the fire? Yes and give him Jost & Che’s job!

Kenan Thompson  
He’s there. You love him or hate him…I’m in the middle. Basically, if you’re below The Kenan Line™, you’re not doing too well.   
Best: I got a big laugh from him being Little Richard and saying “I’m sorry your goddamn dog died”, and he saved Timothee Chalamet’s monologue  
Worst: Law Roach and Kendrick Perkins were just rough.  
Would I save him from the fire? Uh…it’s been 22 years. It would’ve been the perfect time many years ago. But I dunno, he always survives the fire, so what am I gonna do?

Heidi Gardner  
(MVP - Walton Goggins)  
I'm not really a Heidi fan as I just don't think she's a good actor. Plus, she tries SO hard to be trendy and relatable, and it's just sad. But, she had better moments this year than her past 3 years.  
Best: I enjoyed her in Firefighter Therapy, Mile High Burger, Oedipal, Times Square Kiss, and Mothers Day Waiter.  
Worst: But I really didn't like her in Shop TV, Domingo, Cake Show, Earring, Pictures, or hearing her yell ""That's your OPINION!""  
Would I save him from the fire? No. 8 years and spent lots of them being annoying.  

Emil Wakim  
He’s fine. They used him in straight roles a lot, but otherwise, I was constantly waiting to see if he had anything else to offer. Kinda reminds me of Seth Meyers early in his tenure. Was neither great nor bad, seemed nice, and that’s about it.   
Best: He was good in Jury Duty as Luigi, and I enjoyed his 2nd Update bit, but his best moment was definitely the Autofellatio Doctor.  
Worst: Much like Heidi, I didn't like his overacting in Earring.  
Would I save him from the fire? I dunno. I could go either way. He hasn't annoyed me enough but I also just don't see a lot in him.

Marcello Hernandez  
(MVP - Quinta Brunson)  
I think Marcello’s a decent performer with weak writing behind him. I was a fan of his until the show decided he was the next Pete Davidson, then it went downhill. It also felt like he was yelling in most of these sketches. Am I wrong? Sounding like Cookie Monster.   
Best: Sabado Gigante is an example of how to showcase his talent, sadly ruined by making it recurring. And I laughed at his YouTube ad on Nancy Grace.   
Worst: On paper, it makes sense for him to play Desi Arnaz, but he didn’t even attempt to make an impression. Plus he made me groan in Cake Show, Acting Teacher, fake booty in Airport, anything in the John Mulaney episode, and being the new Pete Davidson in Cast Interview. But worst of all...fucking Domingo. There was nothing funny about it, just all the women gushing over someone who barely appears in the sketch. So dumb.  
Would I save him from the fire? No, but he’s not going anywhere.

Colin Jost & Michael Che  
They’re past their prime. I’ve gotten so tired of them. They had a bit of a good streak towards the mid-late part of the season, but it’s still more of the old guard taking up space.   
Best: They can hit occasionally on Update  
Worst: It’s really the same ol’ shtick with Weekend Update. Jost makes racist jokes, Che makes sexist jokes and gets annoyed with the audience's reactions too much, yadda yadda.   
Would I save them from the fire? No. Longest tenured Update anchors and running on the clock for three seasons now. 

Dana Carvey  
I guess I have to rank him because he probably got more screen time than Devon.   
Best: his Biden was pretty funny the first time, but didn’t need to be used as much as it was, and it was nice to see Church Lady back  
Worst: how often they used him. It just felt weird that they randomly put him in to do Elon Musk or Al Pacino.   
Would I save him from the fire? N/A

Devon Walker  
(MVP - Dave Chappelle)  
A Devon spotting was kinda rare this season. I’m honestly surprised he stayed as long as he did because he just seems out of place and has the most dead eyes.   
Best: Calling Dad was a good use of him, plus Waterslide, and his roles in Dave Chappelle sketches  
Worst: His Eric Adams bit on Update was just a bad bit with a nothing impression.  
Would I save him from the fire? No. 

Chloe Fineman  
I felt sad for Chloe this year. She just hasn’t had a highlight or much of a purpose anymore.   
Best: Of course her best work was in the CFT Irish sketch, where she put on a good performance in a weak episode where this sketch could’ve made it better. She was also good in Immigrant Dads  
Worst: I was immediately turned off by her first performance of the season as Hawk Tuah, plus her appearance in Domingo doesn’t help, and was that supposed to be a Parker Posey impression during White POTUS? But the saddest I felt for her was when she played herself in Jury Duty.   
Would I save her from the fire? No. She can move on. 

Sarah Sherman  
Wow, she really sunk recently. I liked her in small doses, but this season, and the year before, just encouraged the worst in her. She breaks too much, doesn’t commit, screams, and begs for attention.   
Best: Makin’ Lurv was a great use of Sarah, plus What’s That Name, Mother’s Day Waiter, and I didn’t even mind her in the controversial White POTUS.  
Worst: Troye Sivan, Liam Gallagher, any of her Update bits, Snakeskin, Domingo, Bernie Sanders, Matt Gaetz, Appendix, and Rachel Maddow would have been good if she wasn’t breaking.  
Would I save her from the fire? Norrr. 

Jane Wickline  
The push to make her a star is baffling. She comes off very wooden. It looks like the show quickly lost confidence in her as they ended up only giving her small roles.   
Best: I thought Opposites Attract was fine, and her part as Mary Kate/Ashley, but her bit in Coffee Store Comedy was the one moment I laughed out loud at her delivery  
Worst: Waterslide was a funny sketch, but she really kept it from being a classic, plus her bit part in Gladiator, the Sabrina Carpenter song, and Tiny Baby Shoe was such a half-assed idea.   
Would I save her from the fire? I think I’ve seen enough Jane. 

Mikey Day  
I’ll just start off by saying Mikey is a candidate for least favorite cast member ever (although it’s hard to argue with Chris Kattan). His screen time was up and down this season but I will never complain about a moment where Mikey isn’t on my TV.   
Best: I have to give him credit for co-writing Washington’s Dream, but Lord Gaga was a decent bit he committed to (it was stupid enough to be kinda funny).  
Worst: just his “acting” in general is worth being his worst moment, but breaking in Mile High Club was annoying, his Beetlejuice wasn’t as good as Samberg’s, plus Shop TV, Dogs, and Coffee Puns where he’s explaining the joke could all be contenders, however, watching him in Intimacy Coordinators just made me so mad that he was on the show, I never put down my middle fingers.  
Would I save him from the fire? No. He had nine years on this show and spent most of that time sucking. 

Bowen Yang  
I was surprised I could dislike a cast member more Mikey, but Bowen was even worse this year. Bowen represents everything I hate about the show. Pandering, vanity, terminally online humor, saying stuff for “clap-ter”, etc. I can’t. This quirky shtick is ridiculous. And you can’t say anything about him without being considered a dick.   
Best: His Chen Biao and part in Milk were fine, but I liked him most in the Bald Men song.  
Worst: Take your pick. Moo Deng, JD Vance, Charli xcx, Therapy, Shrek, Marc Jacobs, Joe Exotic, Drone, Podcast, Hillary Duff, I almost liked the Baby sketch, but it proved to be the inferior sequel to We’re Trying from last season (which I really liked). That said, nothing was as insulting as Spotify Wrapped because he brought on Trisha Paytas. Inexcusable.  
Would I save him from the fire? Hell no.

The coffee is roasted nearby in Carlstadt and served within one to two weeks for peak freshness.

The automotive-themed space will include limited seating, with a small pastry selection expected from local bakery partners.

Previously just an online business selling small-batch coffee in bags and K-Cups, Rippin Coffee Roasters will now offer those same products in-store.

1kqr1yz,https://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=76-1423,(NE) Repeated unlawful entry,"Our maintenance workers keep entering my apartment without notice while I am not home, despite knowing I have a dog. This has happened four times since February, including today where I came home to find my bedroom furniture moved, kitchen light on, my coffee table moved, and a mess. They came to repair/ replace fans, but when I submitted the request last week I specifically noted to give me 24h notice by email so that I can block my dog off and be aware of someone in my home. They did not attempt to call or email me at all. 

The lease specifies that “unless impractical or in emergency situations, they will provide a 24H written notice in advance of all maintenance in the apartment whether requested or not.” The state statute is linked in the post, but it specifies a written 24H notice must be supplied unless in emergency situations. I am uncomfortable with how they are disregarding my right to privacy and notice. My dog is fearful of men and it’s better that I block her off so they can do whatever they need to do, while allowing her to have her designated space without them in it. 
  In February, I sent an email stating that they violated my legal right to notice when they sent a contractor in without telling me. I came home to find my things moved and drywall dust on my toothbrush and in my contact case that day. Since then, they’ve come in three more times without notice and I believe it’s our maintenance supervisor doing it. He’s been here forever and he does whatever he wants whenever. Our office team changes so frequently that I can’t keep track of who’s who. 

Tomorrow, I’ll finish drafting up a letter citing the statute and the lease with the documented violations and plan to send it via certified mail. I’m a grad student finishing up my degree, so I can’t afford to move at the moment time wise. I’m only asking for them to follow the notice requirements in their lease, especially since every situation was non-emergency.

Me and my spouse are in the process of opening a bakery/cafe business! Currently investigating which coffee machine to get, and we're in over our heads!

there are definitely budget constraints to consider, but at the same time, we don't wanna end up screwed because we cheaped out too much on the coffee machine!

So, our cafe will seat about 12-14 people if full, we do plan to offer takeaway, but it's honestly really hard to estimate how much customers we're actually going to get!

We're currently talking to a local coffee repair company and they have offered to sell us a used astoria sae/2hs for MXN58000 and I'm trying to figure out if this is a good deal and a good choice for a small café like us?

It is always brewing very metallic coffee with maybe the taste of aluminum. 

I never scrubbed it, always washed it without soap. I did use soap maybe one every two weeks but otherwise I wiped it with a cloth after rinsing with water. I occasionally cleaned the tube like part from where the water comes out, idk what it's called, with only my finger so no scrubbing. I tried different heat settings, medium, medium low and low. I tried starting with hot water and cold water, tap water and filtered water. But it just keeps producing this awful tasting metallic coffee. 

Could it be because this was the cheaper option available so maybe they used not so good quality metal? Is it time to toss it and buy a better one? It was working perfectly until a few days ago.

I did my due diligence, and everything seemed solid. But this has turned out to be the worst decision of my career so far.

From day one, there was no real onboarding—just a quick walkthrough of some folders. Then I was handed two projects that someone else left mid-way through without doing much, and told to take them to the finish line. The previous engineer did single zone calculations on multiple zone system and realizing these projects are riddled with issues. It honestly feels like a full redesign. Which I guess he also didn't find a calculator. Everytime I asked I was shown the library drive. Currently using LEED OA calculator 😅. I have to use something.

To make things worse, they don’t allow watching webinars during work hours. I have no idea how I’m supposed to keep up my continuing education or maintain my PE license.

Then comes the billing issue—they’ve told me I can’t charge any overhead time, everything must be billed directly to a project. So when I put in extra hours to fix these messes, PMs complain about the high hours. What am I supposed to do? Work 12–14 hours and only log 8? Someone else burned through 80% of the project and I am expected to fix everything with 20% of the budget.

Everyone around me says, “Don’t leave too soon,” but I’m not a job hopper—I’m looking for stability. The problem is, I cannot see myself here for the next 5 or 10 years. This place is 180 degrees different from where I used to work.

My question is—am I overreacting? Or did I just pick the wrong Starbucks? Is this the norm in the industry and I’ve just been lucky till now? How will a potential employer view it if I leave my second job after a few months? First one was 5.5 years of work experience. It is really affecting my mental health.

But has anyone else felt like this? I've moved out for college and I only go to church when I'm home for breaks. It's the 'elephant in the room' with my family — everyone knows that I don't really care about it, I break the word of wisdom (aka drink coffee), and I haven't renewed my temple recommend — but I never explicitly talk about it. I do my very best not to swear in front of my parents or siblings, and I'll order coffee while with them but I'll try to be subtle about it and not shove it in their faces. 

Anyway, I just got home from summer break and I went to my old high school to visit one of my old teachers who I'm actually friends with now that I've graduated. One of my younger sisters was with me. He teases me a lot about being mormon, and then he sort of shifted to teasing my sister. I don't mind when people tease me, but the fact that he was teasing my sister kind of irked me. Similar to me, though, my sister kind of shot back at him and/or defended herself. My old teacher / friend revealed that my sister would swear in class, drink tea, etc. She also complained about the church while we were all in there. She alluded that she'd stop renewing her temple recommend soon.

I usually avoid conversations about my loss in faith, because I don't want to be accused of being a 'bad influence' as an older sister. I don't want to unintentionally 'sway' my siblings in one direction, or have my parents blame me if they end up leaving the church, too. My sister is a junior, so she's been touring colleges, and she did really like BYU when she toured (or at least she said she did), so I'm not sure where she's at right now. Is she lying to our family to appease my parents? Does she like BYU, but wants to be less intense about the church as a whole? And I'm scared to ask her, because I don't want that to be seen as me 'swaying' her in some way, and I don't like talking about my own feelings about the church. It's all so complicated, and I'm bad at talking about hard things, so I usually avoid the subject altogether.

I know these are all small things, and I'm being very overdramatic. Has anyone else felt this kind of guilt, though? I'm just terrified of my parents blaming me if my sisters also turn out 'exmo.' Because I love my parents, and they love me, and I just want to make them proud, but they care so deeply about the church, and that's the one thing I can't meet them halfway on. And I'm trying to compensate in other ways for it, but I feel awful. I don't want to be blamed if they leave, and so when they talk or complain about the church, it scares me, because I do want the best for them, but I'm scared of hurting my parents any further, too.

I hope this made some minimal amount of sense. This is frustrating, because I feel like I'm taking steps backward. I think I've done a lot of healing from the church this past year. I don't hold as much resentment, and I've hardly even thought of my religious trauma. It doesn't have as massive of an effect on me as it used to. But I feel like it's coming back now that I'm home and with my family. I don't know. This was just a quick little ramble, I'm sorry if it sounds selfish. ",4,1747698515.0,exmormon,2,1.0,False

# From Coast to Coast to Coast



Canada, a beautiful country with a nebulous identity. Some forty-one million people try to answer the question of what it means to be Canadian. There is little common ground between the wheat farmer just north of Moose Jaw and the painter in Mile End. Yet they call themselves the same name, love the same coffee in the morning, and taste an air they'd both call uniquely Canadian. A comfortable status quo is waning, and little stands in its way. The dream is crumbling, and the country scrambles to find what might be left behind in its wake. No matter what it is, it will be faced together; unity, nevertheless, is as transient as the short first spring, cut short by the second snowfall of the year.

In the midst of this quotidian life on the precipice, whispers of a conspiracy drift from locale to locale, the tiniest dredges of substance keeping them afloat. A murder suspect here, a robber there, whispering about a renewal, about *something*. Second-, third-hand reports all contradicting one another. Some say there is a new world coming. Some say that this one will grow stronger. Some say something else, and others spin yet another story. Few are talking about it, but those who are call it everything under the sun. There's a school of thought to dismiss it all, insofar as any school exists in the first place, ridiculous nonsense some might call it. But others aren't so quick to dismiss it. With the world being pulled tauter yet by the day, there are few things that can be entirely dismissed. Even little conspiracies about murders and kidnappings, whispers of something to come. Even those have their place in the conversation.

Perhaps to simply appease these sorts in the bureaucratic chain of survival, perhaps to reassign some busybodies causing some trouble, an official investigation has been opened very quietly. Task Force 728-KH-4, a body tentatively under the oversight of the RCMP, has been charged with investigating a possible linkage between some disparate violent crimes in Canada by some movement surrounding this 'renewal'. With very little funding and even less oversight, it is not a respected body, something reflected in its skeleton crew. Composed of civilian, law enforcement, and a few unlucky military personnel, what it lacks in organisation it fails to make up for in quite literally anything else. Nobody in their right mind wants to be assigned to it. Few even know it exists. A blip in the organisational radar, cared for by nobody.

You are one of the few members of its field group component. Tasked with taking the investigation out there to the country, you are looking for proverbial needles in a pile of haystacks. Or, more accurately, whispers of what is probably nothing in the midst of an entire country. Chasing ideatic ghosts, as it were. At least the pay and benefits are decent for the civilians, and there are far more stressful assignments out there for the rest. Nevertheless, it's no secret it's the dead end for anyone's career. Still, here you are, investigating.

After all, who knows what you might find?

Thank you for reading the chronicle introduction above! What follows is OOC information about the chronicle. Please give it a read!

This is a H:tR 5e chronicle (not set in the WoD universe) that will be playing on **Sunday evenings**. This is going to be a very roleplay-heavy chronicle focusing on character and dialogue for the most part, though there may be combat depending on how the group chooses to approach different situations! It is a very player-driven chronicle, so the direction of the story will change drastically depending on your choices. Thank you for your interest in the chronicle and reading this far! To speak a little more on what this chronicle is about, it's a celebration of Canada and what it means to be Canadian, exploring the country in all its beautiful provinces and territories. It's a long-form mystery-thriller with a political slant and noir themes, so if that's up your alley, then we're in business!

In-character is in-character and out-of-character are out-of-character, but I believe this is very important to say: **there will be NO space for bigoted players at the table**. While characters may hold their own prejudices, this should never, ever be taken into the out-of-character space. Furthermore, the in-character space should not be used as a veil for bigotry either. While bigotry and bigoted characters are topics that will be explored, simply using the in-character space to direct prejudice towards another player will NOT be tolerated. I have seen this happen before, it is a no tolerance matter at my tables. Players will be removed if this occurs. That is a promise.

As this is a queer-friendly space, please respect all identities. If that is going to be an issue, do not apply for this campaign. Similarly, this is a Jewish friendly space (I myself am Jewish), so if you have problems with Jews, do not apply for this campaign. But if you're down for a queer-friendly and Jewish-friendly space, then I'm ready to rock and roll and have a good time roleplaying with you!

Chickens needing another food source, because all grass has died and the weeds were horridly invasive and I set them all on fire.... like a year ago. My parents pick up fruit and veggie waste for feeding my chickens, ducks, and goose, but bring too much at once for them to consume before it rots. I'm tired of throwing money at dried mealworms, and throwing out rotting food that the birds couldn't get to before it was unappetizing. so I'm trying to make composting work.
I have a lot of silly questions I don't find answers for 🥲

Mostly from throwing soiled straw, droppings from sand bedding used in brooders, branches cut in the yard, to burn...  I've found out something is working, lol. I haven't burned in weeks and it was warm in the middle!
So, I collected it from the middle of the yard and arranged in layers to get the best 50/50 green/brown ratio, if I understood it right at all. Here's what I did:
I arranged decomposing and dried sticks on dirt. Per a reddit response I saw on composting [rotting eggs](https://www.reddit.com/r/composting/comments/orsjz5/comment/h6k4u9z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I topped with my shredder paper and arranged old eggs that didn't develop in incubation on top and sprinkled diatomaceous earth to help with the future smell. I laid down disassembled veggie cardboard cartons, complete with putrid juices, broke all the eggs, and sprayed the cardboard down with water. Not a lot because I had decomposing watermelon, tomato, coffee grounds, cabbage leaves, etc. to throw on top. I cut it up with my shovel, threw soiled bedding on, mixed it up. I threw on freshly dug up oak, hikory, chinaberry saplings and drying mulberry branches. Another layer of soiled bedding, cardboarded damp with juices again, and soiled bedding to top it all off.

Did I do it even remotely right?/
Do you guys add food discards/scraps for feeding poultry directly to the pile??/
Will there be less or more flies as it starts to decompose?/
Is soiled poultry bedding a ""green"" or a ""brown"" additive?!
Does the sand in the chick droppings affect compost negatively?/
I thought this needed to be turned weekly, but making use of the *juicy* cardboard makes that a bit impossible. Will I be basically dissassembling and restacking or flipping this pile when it's time?/
Furthermore... when exactly is it ""time""?/
Do I need to build a shade over this?/

I have a huge crush on this guy at my college. I always see him around at the library (purely coincidental at first!). 
I feel ridiculous, I don’t normally have ‘crushes’ but I think he’s so attractive and I really like how he carries himself. I’ve never actually seen him outside of the library, but yeah im not really sure what to do. Maybe he thinks the same a little bit if I’m lucky but I’m worried the ship might sail before either of us do anything and frankly I don’t know if I can muster up the courage in case of embarrassment. 
I also do sort of want it to come from him…
I feel like the advice is going to be ‘just talk to him ‘ or ‘if you want it to happen you have to try’ and normally I would agree but I just don’t think I can do it. It’s too different from the normal scenario of meeting a guy at a bar or something and hooking up
And I know nothing about his social life so I can’t put myself in places he might be. Like if there was a coffee shop I knew he went to it’d be easier. I’d settle for trader joes 😭😭 don’t know his name, his friends, nothing

Prefacing this whole thing with the fact that I am looking for connection and conversation but open to more if it develops. Just putting low expectations on everyone involved as this is Reddit and, well, you get where I’m going with that. 

Anywho, about me: I’m a musician. I’ve been playing music since I was in high school and writing my own songs all along the way. I play a couple instruments and sing. I’ve toured, released records, played some big shows and plenty of not so big shows… until recently when I’ve taken a step back to focus on other things in life. I still write my own stuff, however. 

I love coffee, travel, and digging through crates for weird vinyl records. I also enjoy some sports - football, basketball, and hockey. Outside of that I’m a tech enthusiast and have a 3d printer that gets plenty of use. 

I’m currently back in school and working towards my degree while working full time. My dream once I finish school is spend a month exploring Europe if all things shake out accordingly. 

Outside of that I’m on a fitness quest and so far have made a bit of progress but still have a long road ahead of me. The benefits on my mental health alone are worth every day leg day kicks my ass, haha. 

And as I feel it is worth mentioning just in case:  I am child free (but look forward to being a rad aunt), and monogamous. Also a domme. 

Who I’m looking for…
Well, first and foremost I am not looking to chat with anyone too much younger than myself. Let’s say 28–40 would be my ideal range, especially if it’s for more than just friendly chat. 

Beyond that… anyone who shares some common interests. I value reciprocity in conversation so please be prepared to have some back and forth. I also value good energy, positivity (not to be confused with toxic positivity) and someone who has goals and things they’re pursuing. I’ve always been told I’m a good motivator and an even better cheerleader. 

I am truly open to strictly new friends, anyone who wants to chat sports/hobbies, or perhaps someone who wants to be fitness buddies. I’m always trying to expand my world not shrink it.",2,1747698154.0,lesbianr4r,0,0.75,False

1. College enrollment is 60-65% women, so two times as many women are being educated. The gender-gap for higher education has not only *reversed but actually gotten worse* since Title IX passed in 1972. College attendance is a strong predictor of income, and this leads to #2.  
2. Income - In metro areas, women make more money than men for the <30 age bracket. This is not all women, but the <30 age bracket covers prime dating years and includes college students, recent college graduates, and young couples dating for their first marriage.   
3. Home ownership - Women are more likely than men to buy a home and be homeowners. Considering the home is the largest portion of a person's net worth, this could be a predictor that women will be wealthier than men in the future.  
4. Political influence - Women are more likely than men to vote and now make up the majority of voters. 10 million more women than men are registered to vote.

These trends are likely to continue, making things better and better for women. But at what point will women be satisfied and is such a thing possible when human wants are infinite? 

**Hypocritically, as empowered as women are, most women still don't want to:**  
1. Be the one to approach and ask men out.  
2. Pay for dates (when they make more money)   
3. Date a man less educated than them.  
4. Date a man who makes less money than them.   
5. Date a shorter man.  
6. Be the bread-winner/provider (if their man is unemployed)

You can't have it both ways. You can't be empowered until you are superior to men in every aspect and still expect to find a man better than you (for marriage). 

**The United States should be the closest thing to a feminist utopia in this world, but antidepressant use for women is at an all-time high.** The fact is, living in a country where you have no dating prospects because the majority of men are less educated than you and make less money than you, puts women on *suicide watch*. It is hell for them.

**If empowering women made them happier, then how happy would you be in the ultimate feminist utopia?**

Who am I:
- Graduated with an Electrical and Computer Engineering background
- Based in Seattle, WA
- Job hunting for both SDE and Technical Product Manager (TPM) roles
- Mainly skilled app developer, frontend and machine learning
- English isn’t my first language, but hope that’s would be our working language

Project I am currently working on is an iOS app that can:
- Help high school students/college freshman find the best fit major using AI model
- Platform students can finding/sharing learning path during their university study and recent grad could find advice for their career path

What do we have for our project so far:
- Definition of the project, first draft docs are ready
- Figma first draft done
- Front-end in XCode, almost done

Who am I looking for:
- Recent grad who is unemploy
- Commit approximately 5 hours of work per day(so it can be considered as full-time job experience, helps with resume gap)
- backend and machine learning engineer

What will we do and why join me:
- Do our project and gain real experience before landing a job
- Helping interviews, we can mock interview weekly or bi-weekly
- Left the project anytime once you land a job
- Hopefully I can help to keep your opt status valid(not sure yet)

Note: This is an unpaid collaboration. I’m not able to offer any salary at this point, so please be aware of that before reaching out, and commit around 5 hours per day, 5 days a week is required. Since we really want to build something, it costs time. 

Thanks for your understanding. And this is mutual select, I will send my resume, all the docs, code, figma to you during our meeting as well. 

Also, I am open to talk, if you just want to talk to a recent grad, welcome to coffee chat with me!!!

I am specifically looking for a crate that is like two milk crates placed side-by-side, which can also hold two crates on top. I manage a restaurant and prefer storing items in something other than open boxes. I know this is a big ask, but if it exists, I trust you guys to help me find it.

The standard size for milk crates is 13x13x11 so I would need something that's 26x13x11 or some height around 11 and some length of 19 to 26 I'm okay if it is not as precise but it would be preferred. 

I currently keep coffee bags in milk crates; the amount in each box fits perfectly. We have three blends: regular, decaf, and dark roast. Because we order less decaf and dark roast, those fit in crates, but I have to either split the regular coffee box between two crates or keep it in the box. I would like to keep the regular coffee on the bottom, stacking the decaf and dark roast on top. This way, I can grab the regular coffee from the front, and when we need decaf or dark roast, I can move it to the front. It is important that the larger crate can hold the other two without them falling forward. I'm not in a time crunch, and any suggestions would be appreciated!",1,1747697508.0,HelpMeFind,4,1.0,False

1kqqcum,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1kqqcum/afi_screenwriting_mfa_deciding_vs_ucla/,AFI Screenwriting MFA? (deciding vs. UCLA),"Hi everyone, I just got off the waitlist for AFI Screenwriting after committing to UCLA for my MFA. Only have a week to accept or decline AFI's offer and don't know a ton about the program or many alums. Taking to Reddit in hopes that some of you are on this sub!

Would love to hear your perspective on any of the following:

* Writing curriculum: UCLA is a pure writing program. At AFI you write 3 features, 1 pilot and 2 specs, and as I understand it you also write shorts for directors throughout your time. If that's correct, how many shorts do you write? What does the process look like (i.e. are they workshopped)?
* Non-writing curriculum: Can/do screenwriting fellows take classes outside the screenwriting track (like in production or directing)?
* Set experience: My only real hesitation with UCLA is that screenwriters can't make anything (you can only PA on other students' sets). At AFI, what involvement do Fellows have in the making of shorts beyond writing the scripts? What are the formal avenues to learn how to actually make films, work with equipment, etc?
* ""Pod"" model: IDK what you guys call it, but I know that AFI puts students into teams with 1 per discipline to make shorts. How does that model work? Do you switch teams every semester? 
* Reputation: Does it matter at all? Are AFI alums willing to do coffees/informational interviews with students? Any thoughts on AFI's reputation vs. UCLA's? (I'm not expecting anyone to hand me anything off the strength of a name, networking and creating my own opportunities is 100% on me.)

Money is a factor but not a dealbreaker - I wouldn't have to go into debt to attend either school but obviously AFI is a bigger burden. I'm also set on going to film school since I'm switching careers and have never taken even a single writing class, so while I totally understand that no one in the industry cares if you went to school, it's the right path for me.

1kqqafi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kqqafi/my_boss_created_a_childhood_classic_one_superfan/,My Boss Created a Childhood Classic. One Superfan Built a Cult Around It.,"I’ve been his bodyguard for two decades now. There’s never been an issue. Sure, some of the fans were *strange* and there’s been a hairy convention or two, but there’s never been any *problems*. If the adoring public ever got too close to my boss, I’d just push them off, raise my shoulders and tell them, clearly and sternly, that he needs some space.

A crazy with a knife, maybe some kid with a Chapman complex — that’s what I was looking out for. That’s what I considered to be the worst-case scenario. That’s what I thought would be a credible threat.

Little did I know that there’s men like H. Willow out there.

 

You don’t know my boss’s name, but you know his work. Back in the 90s he was involved in the creation of an intellectual property that took the world by storm. Tv, movies, games, cards, merch — you’re *definitely* familiar.

Most of his public appearances are at conventions but, every once in a while, when a super-fan writes in, he’ll do a private meet and greet. Every time I ever went traveling with the boss, it was to meet sick fans, or maybe someone with a business proposal. Normal stuff. Nothing exciting to write about.

But then, one day, a letter came in from a certain H. Willow. 

H., or Professor Willow, as he referred to himself in the letter, claimed to a steadfast supporter of my boss’s work. A rapturous audience to everything connected to the intellectual property, licensed or not. He even dreamt, nightly, of the creatures my boss had created. Being a man of significant means, H. Willow wanted to show his thanks with a private theatrical performance. A jet would be chartered at our nearest convenience.

My boss seemed excited about the prospect of being flown out for something fancy. When he asked for my opinion, I said the invitation seemed fine. The place for the *theatrical performance* was a provincial town just outside the Chinese border. Maybe that should have given me some pause, but it did not.

I was just happy to go visit a part of the world I hadn’t seen yet.

Within three days of my boss’s reply, we had a jet waiting for us. Contractors, paid in full for the next two weeks. My boss could visit whenever he wanted, if he found a bodyguard necessary so be it. I tried finding out as much as I could about this H. Willow during the flight, but the crew knew nothing about him. All they could say is that he was *very* *generous*.

The town we arrived in couldn’t have had a population of more than fifty thousand but had the smoothest runway I’ve ever landed on. When we got out, the asphalt felt brand new. The rest of the city looked battered. Old Soviet panel houses and remnants of factories stretched out as far as the eye could see. Out from beyond all the cement peeked out the tower of a discount art-deco hotel.

We were picked up from the airport by cheery hotel staff. They too, mainly talked about how *very* *generous* Professor Willow was. One of them mentioned that he’s a scientist, but any details remained a mystery.

I was given a room at the ground floor while my boss got the presidential suite. Before I even managed to put down my bags, he was calling me up. Willow had provided gifts, apparently.

The accommodations of the basement room were spartan. Bed, dresser, an off-smelling but private en suite bathroom. The presidential was fancy enough with its parlor and terrace and atrium, yet it was Willow’s gifts that made the luxury excessive. Not only had he ordered just about every bottle of liquor imaginable to the room, he had also laid out a plethora of jewels and watches on the bed.

Some of the accessories were related to the creatures my boss designed, and were terribly kitsch for it, but there was a gold-plated digital watch that caught my eye. I asked my boss if I could take it. He said I could take two.

Just as the overwhelming generosity of our host was starting to dawn on us, there was a knock on the door. It was one of the hotel employees, grinning from ear to ear, trying to keep us as happy as possible. When we were ready, she said, Professor Willow was waiting for us in the restaurant.

H. Willow was a lanky bald man with an intense stare. The moment we appeared in the doorway, he launched from his seat to greet my boss. Willow embraced my boss with such vigor that I wondered whether I shouldn’t step in. My boss didn’t seem to mind though. Our mysterious benefactor was definitely strange, but his love for my boss’s creations seemed genuine.

Everything had been cleared away in the restaurant. Only a single rotating table remained at the center of the hall. I would’ve felt awkward standing behind my boss for the duration of the dinner, but Willow already had two men flanking his seat. Twin giants with shaved heads. The suits they wore barely fit them and their dull eyes stared off into the ether. 

At first, Willow excitedly spoke about my boss’s work the same way any other fan would. He told him about his favorite creatures, about the moments in the lore that resonated with him, about the future of my boss’s intellectual property. It was as Willow spoke about the future, however, that his speech started to slowly morph. Our strange benefactor didn’t speak about the creatures my boss committed to paper as things of the imagination. Willow spoke about them as real creatures. He spoke about them in the future tense.

The conversation I was listening in on was strange, but so was the entire night. Willow seemed harmless enough. About halfway through the meal, however, my boss asked if he could share some of the food with me. All of the stuff set up on the table was inspired by my boss’s creations and there was a particular beef roll that he insisted I had to try.

Neither Willow, nor his guards, acknowledged me for the whole evening. When my boss asked if he could share the food, our generous host agreed but there was a disgust in the look he spared me. The beef roll my boss passed me was, indeed, delicious, yet much of its taste was lost in the discomfort I felt. Willow’s glare was momentary, but the gaze of his muscle was singular. As I chewed, the massive guards chewed along with me, as if trying to mirror my movements. As their jaws shifted and their mouths opened, I quickly started to suspect they had no teeth.

Once the main course was finished the table was cleared by the ever so friendly hotel staff. Then, desert and coffee were brought out. As all the gourmet puddings and cakes were carried to the table, a group of a dozen or so musicians entered the restaurant and prepared for a performance.

They played an awe-inspiring rendition of the theme song for the show based off of my boss’s work. The music was truly marvelous, it even brought a tear to my boss’s eye. Once the song was finished and the plates were cleared, I presumed the night to be over. I was more than happy to go back to my barren room and sleep off all the strangeness of the evening.

H. Willow, however, had different plans. The dinner was just an appetizer for the night’s plans. There was something else, something *much more impressive,* he wanted my boss to see. It would be a bit of a drive, but H. Willow promised an unforgettable experience.

On our way out of the hotel, I asked my boss how he was feeling. It was quite late in the evening already and there wasn’t much about H. Willow that suggested normalcy, but he was happy to continue watching the night unfold. Willow’s strange glare, his odd toothless guards, the entire lavish nature of the visit — it all made me uncomfortable. With my boss unbothered, however, I stayed quiet.

One of his guards took the wheel and I sat in the front seat while the Professor and my boss sat in the back. My worries about H. Willow’s sanity and intentions did not improve in the car. The moment we started moving, Willow began to talk about his dreams. Apparently, back in university, in the 80s, well before my boss’s work was public — he saw the creatures in a feverish vision which dictated the rest of his life.

Willow kept asking my boss how he came up with his ideas, whether he too had been visited in his sleeps with, what Willow called, *visions of the future*. The bald man’s speech became more erratic with every word that came out of his mouth, but my boss kept his cool. When Willow demanded to know the source of his inspiration, my boss simply smiled and told him it was a trade secret.

H. Willow was frustrated by the lack of shared dreams but he took his frustration in stride. The moment my boss rebuffed him, the man started to speak of science. Willow had made his fortune in the field of biology. That is all I could gather from his talk. Very quickly the scientist’s speech descended into academic babble which I couldn’t comprehend. I don’t know if my boss understood anything that Willow was saying, but if he didn’t, he didn’t let it show. As H. Willow rambled about the intricacies of genetic modification, my boss simply smiled and nodded.

The moon was high up in the sky and the flat land around us was painted in light. We drove through the featureless steppe for about forty-five minutes when our destination started to rise on the horizon. Like a man-made boil in the midst of smooth nature, the thing rose from the ground — a domed city.

*Willow-ville, Willow-town* — the professor was still working out the name, but he was certain of one thing: the city was the future. It is from this domed place that he would rule when the time came. It is here that people would be safe from the *final century*.

The gate which led into the dome was staffed by four men with rifles that looked identical to the bodyguards Willow had brought to our dinner. With far-off looks they waved the car past the translucent glass and into the city.

The rows of panel houses that lined the edges of the town didn’t look any different than the ones we had seen around our hotel, yet the city differed in one unavoidable aspect. At its center stood a mammoth grassy hill, and at the top of the hill sat a structure of jagged metal which looked like some sort of a factory. Willow proudly pointed to the terrible building and claimed that it was his laboratory. The whole complex had been built inside of the hill. Anyone who was inside of it would be safe when the *end* came.

Before we had a chance to inquire what *end* Willow was talking about, the car stopped. At the foot of the hill stood a dozen or so teenagers with a couple of Willow’s bald-headed giants. The kids had ragged clothes and looked hungry, yet the moment we got out of the car they broke into song. My boss enjoyed the rendition of the theme song we heard at the hotel. This performance, he appreciated a lot less.

The teens looked haggard and unwell and even though they sang with gusto, none of them appeared to be comfortable. When their performance finished, my boss started to inquire about their well-being. Willow shrugged off all his questions. The youths *understood their purpose*, he said. They would be proud to become role models for *the world that was to come*.

Before my boss managed to make any more inquiries, the earth at the base of the hill parted to reveal a gate. Beyond the gate was a hallway of pure white metal. Willow’s guards left little room for negotiation. We were to follow the professor.

The hallway crisscrossed with identical passages and was filled with cameras which followed our every move. The crowd of teens moved with us at the start of the journey, but without a single sound they veered off a couple minutes in. I was trying to keep track of what turns we were taking throughout the walk, but it was difficult to focus. H. Willow’s already erratic speech had soundly descended into madness. He wouldn’t stop raving about the *final century* and how *culture will have to be reinvented* and a plethora of other insane claims. Willow’s madness was on full display, and it was beyond unnerving, but what made the situation so much worse were the moments where he would pause, smile at my boss and claim that he was just telling him things he already knew. All of these things were already discussed in the visions which *both of them* had.

My boss did not comment on Willow’s assertions. He simply smiled and nodded and would shoot me a worried glance whenever the professor was distracted with his ramblings.

Our unease steadily grew throughout the night, but it wasn’t until we reached our destination that it reached its peak. Deep inside the complex sat a massive hall the size of a football pitch. The ground was of packed earth and delineated into two halves with chalk. Standing on each side of the arena stood two of the teens we had seen outside. Each of them had a strange metal contraption attached to their wrist which seemed to weigh them down to one side.

From our viewing gallery, Willow rambled once more. He spoke of how after the *final century* passes culture must be born anew. He spoke of how these teens, these *Hybrid masters* as he called them, would inspire the common folk and remind them of the *new social hierarchy*. Willow raved about some fantastical new world order he had envisioned and then, with the passion of an orchestra conductor, he ordered the *battle to begin*.

I half expected the children to start fighting each other, but they did not. What happened was much stranger than that. Each of the teens extended the arm with the metal bracelet on it. With a static snap, two creatures which defied explanation appeared on each side of the arena.

One of the beasts was a snake. It floated in the air, suspended by what seemed to be dozens of little wings spread out down its spine. The second creature almost looked like an oversized racoon with the exception of its bright massive tail which bristled with sparks. Under shouted orders from the teens, the creatures threw themselves at each other and began to fight.

My boss had been growing steadily uncomfortable since the strange group of teens performed the theme song, but seeing the unearthly beasts battle was the last straw. He got up and declared that he wanted to go home.

H. Willow did not take this news well. As the horrid abominations of biology fought down in the arena, Willow kept asking my boss to repeat himself. His face was almost child-like in his confusion. When the man, finally, understood that my boss wanted to leave, he had but a single question.

*Why?*

Surely, he could not be leaving in offence. This was exactly what the visions dictated. The scene playing out in the arena was a pure manifestation of my boss’s life work. They had both had the same visions. They both knew they were witnessing a cosmic good. Surely, my boss didn’t think H. Willow was a madman.

With every word the professor said, his voice turned colder. What was once an expression of genuine confusion slowly morphed into the petulant scowl of a child who’s been told no. I tried stepping in, but with a rough shove, one of Willow’s giants put me back in my seat.

My boss’s voice shook as he spoke, but he delivered his message clearly. He did not think H. Willow was mad. What he saw did, indeed, please him. He found the professor to be a *most generous* host. The reason why he wanted to leave was because he just had a vision himself. He felt inspired. He needed to go back to his hotel room to collect his sketchpad and commit the dictate to paper. Surely, someone who had the exact same visions would understand.

The moment my boss invoked the visions, Willow’s demeanor changed. He ordered the teens below to *‘retract their Hybrids.’* In flashes of static, the ungodly creatures disappeared and we were allowed to leave. When the escort took us down the hallways the professor kept urging the giants to move quickly. Inspiration was not to be kept waiting.

As we got out of the hill complex Willow tried getting into the car with us, but my boss barred him. He had to work alone, he claimed. It would only be a couple of hours. Willow could come and visit at the hotel for lunch if he wanted to see what the visions brought.

Willow seemed deaf to the timing of his next visit, but he finally relented. We were sat in the car and driven back to the hotel by one of the giants. The drive was much shorter this time around. There was little life in our driver’s eyes, but he kept his foot on the pedal.

The guard we were assigned didn’t seem to be fully capable of understanding complex sentences, but me and the boss stayed quiet for the whole ride. It wasn’t until we got up to the hotel room that we felt safe talking.

He wanted out. Immediately. I was more than happy to start booking tickets.

It took a bit of googling, but I managed to find a train connection leaving in the morning that could get us to a city with an airport. By sunset, we would a continent away from H. Willow and his insane breed of science.

I managed to book the tickets, even had them downloaded on the phone, but just as I was looking up instructions on how to get to the train station the wi-fi in the room shut off. A couple minutes later, someone started banging on the door.

No words. Just hits. Thunderous, dumb, non-negotiable thumps.

There were three of them at the door. All identical. All wearing the same ill-fitting suits. All bigger than me. I barricaded the door with whatever furniture I could find but I knew the giants wouldn’t be kept out for long if they made an effort. When I told my boss what was happening, he only had one question.

Had I seen any other guests at the hotel since we arrived?

Just as the reality of our situation started to dawn upon us, the phone rang. It was the Professor. Unsurprisingly, H. Willow had no interest in talking to me. He only had words for my superior. The professor pleaded with my boss to come back, to see what other plans he had brewing, what other aspects of their shared vision had been brought to life. Even as Willow raved into the phone, his giants kept beating on our door. My boss tried excusing himself diplomatically but Willow wasn’t one to be rebuffed. When the wood of the door started to crack, I grabbed the phone and spoke to H. Willow myself.

I told him, in no uncertain terms, that my boss did not wish to speak to him. He was making him uncomfortable and if he truly enjoys his work the most respectful thing to do would be to leave him alone.

The speech has worked on dozens of obsessive fans and stalkers, but I suspect much of it has to do with my physical presence. Through the phone and with three of his men bearing down our door, I did not expect Willow to relent his mania.

When I finished my speech, the other end of the line was quiet.

Then, in a wounded voice, H. Willow demanded I pass the phone back to my boss. With the giants now pushing up against the barricaded furniture, I followed the professor’s instructions.

All he asked was whether what I said was true. When my boss confirmed that Willow was, indeed, making him uncomfortable, the professor hung up. Not long after, the banging against the furniture stopped. The giants had almost made their way past the barricade, but they left without a word.

Neither of us slept that night. No giants came, the phone didn’t ring, not even the cheery hotel staff came up to check on us. The rest of the night went by peacefully.

The train to the nearest airport was at eight. I was beyond vigilant as we made our way out of the hotel, fearing that Willow would send his men to capture us and take us back to his demented dome city. But he didn’t. Our taxi driver to the train station had all of his hair and most of his teeth. He even seemed intent on chatting using the little English that he knew to chat with us. The people at the station were just as unremarkable. We boarded without incident.

It wasn’t until the train started moving that I breathed a sigh of relief. With every passing moment, we were further and further away from H. Willow’s insanity. I considered us safe. I considered the whole affair over. Not fifteen minutes after we left the station, however, the train came to a screeching halt.

A familiar trio approached our seats. The giants no longer wore their ill-fitting suits. They were dressed in riot gear with rifles slung across their shoulders. Willow wore what could only be described as a regal lab coat.

Before I had a chance to even fully come to terms with the intrusion, I was yanked out of my seat. The giants did not speak, but their rifles were clear. I was not to move. Calmly, as if he weren’t holding us at gunpoint, H. Willow sat down next to my boss and started to speak.

His voice was soft, pleading even. He spoke of the coming end of the world, how the *final century* was more certain by the day. It may be months, it may be years, it may be a decade or two — but the world we knew would come to an end. He told my boss that if he stayed, if he went back to that domed city, he would be spared the horrors that were to come.

Yet it was not mere survival that Willow promised. My boss would live like a king. Like a God among men. He would rule side by side with the professor and would finally get the respect he deserved.

My boss didn’t manage any words. Willow’s stare, the giants, the guns — it was all too much for him. All my boss managed to do was shake his head.

I feared that Willow would turn violent, that he would have us both shot on the spot, but he didn’t. Instead, his shoulders slumped, the fire went out of his eyes and he told my boss he was sorry to hear his reply. With that, he left us be.

Within five minutes, the train started to move once more.

No one in the carriage ever acknowledged the sudden stop, or the armed men, or H. Willow’s presence. The rest of the train ride was eerily uneventful. In truth, I did not mind. I was just happy to get as far away from the madman as I could.

It wasn’t until we were going through the security check at the airport that I remembered the two gold plated watches I had grabbed back at the hotel. They weren’t showing time, or at least not time in hours and minutes. Instead, on the digital screen, there was a counter. The numbers sat somewhere in the high twenty-thousands and they stayed that way until we landed. Then, a day later, the number dropped by one.

After a couple of days, I presumed that the numbers were days and were counting down to something. With the number high enough, I didn’t worry much. Whatever was being counted down to was still far off.

Yet it quickly became apparent that the numbers don’t always go down by a full day. Sometimes it’s a week. Sometimes it’s a month. A couple days ago, the number dropped by a full thousand.

The display on both of the watches reads around eighteen thousand today, but I fear what it will show tomorrow. I fear how quickly those numbers will drop. I fear that H. Willow’s predictions of the *final century* will come to [pass](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/q2qjz1/%D2%93%D1%8B%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%BC%D0%B8_%D2%9B%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B%D1%80%D2%93%D1%8B/).

It was my first time there and my first time with 2Fast. When I tried to research and prepare for my session, I wasn't able to find much info via Google. I created a reddit account just to make this post with the hope that it will help others in the future. I included my experience level at the end for context / reference.*

# 2025 ORP Status and Details

* Google Maps has accurate information for the track other than hours of operation.
* The entry to the track is gravel and has many large potholes.
   * If you're riding your street bike to the track, this entry road could be challenging.
* There's a $10 dollar gate fee to be paid upon entry. If you don't have cash, you have to go to the office to pay. Once you pay, you get a wristband.
   * Even though I had one, no one ever checked me for it so don't feel like you need to show it.
* The track surface was recently patched. When I spoke to 300 level (advanced) riders at the end of the day, they indicated that the patches were ""slimy-er"" than last year, causing their back tire to slip a bit in turns.
* The track surface consists of three main sections all the way around with a tar sealed seam running along each section. It's essentially paved in thirds running the length of the track.
* There were sections where the race line coincided with a seam, so avoiding the seam required a conscious effort.
   * I avoided the seams, but I'm not sure it was entirely necessary.
* A coach told me the following regarding this course:
   * There are 5 ""blind"" turns where you either crest a hill right before the turn or the apex of the turn is not yet visible from the turn in point.
   * There are four turns that look very similar.
* It is very common to have a lot of wind at this location - especially in the afternoon.
* If you are physically riding anything anywhere on the property, including a bike, razor scooter, Onewheel etc, you need to wear a helmet.
   * Bring a bike helmet so you don't have to wear your motorcycle helmet.
* Restrooms and showers are very nice and clean. There's a portable toilet at the far end of the paddock so you don't have to walk all the way to the restrooms by the office.
* Bleachers for spectators are limited. Access to them is through grassy fields with limited or no pathways.
   * There's no ADA or stroller access to the bleachers, nor could you easily ride a bicycle or pit bike to them.
* Other areas of the facility were seemingly ADA complaint with ramps for entry and doorsill free restroom entryway thresholds. I'm not sure about other specifics for this i.e. toilet specific accommodations or availability of handicapped parking.

# 2Fast Impressions

**Prior to track day**

* 2Fast does an incredible job marking course:
   * The braking zones are marked with large white signs indicating 3-2-1-0 or 2-1-0. These signs are located *on the opposite side of each turn* where heavy braking is required so you can tell the direction of the next turn well in advance in the event you aren't sure.
   * 2Fast uses cones on the sides of the track to indicate the turn in points, corner apex, and exit targets.
* If you are worried about learning the course, you can attend the first 100 level session regardless of the session you are registered for. More on that below.
* *There was surprisingly minimal information provided upon registering for the track day. I'll answer as many of these questions as I can further below in the ""On Track Day"" section.*
   * Previous track days I've attended included an overview of the flags an their meanings as well as procedures for restarts after a flag as well as crash recovery information.
   * 2Fast didn't indicate which days traveled in which direction around the track, making it difficult to prepare.
   * There was no venue specific info such as the gravel access road, gate fee, or venue specific rules such as pit speed limits, bicycle helmet requirements in the paddock area, etc.
   * No information was provided regarding purchasing coaching or coaching availability for that day.
   * I couldn't find any information regarding riding gear requirements or a bike technical inspection checksheet so I wasn't sure exactly what gear to bring (label requirements, etc) or how to prep my bike (masking headlights, removing mirrors, etc).
      * I'm still not sure exactly what was checked. I heard other riders mention shock rebound, chain tension and visual inspection for leaks or loose parts.
   * No check in process detail was provided so I didn't know what I needed to do, where to go, or how to get my bike checked (tech inspection.)
   * The website has an FAQ section with the outline of the day's events called ""What to Expect"", but it didn't include the info above.
* **Regarding the Rider Levels:** The description of the different levels on the website was ambiguous and inconsistent (there were varying descriptions in different areas of the site.)
   * I initially signed up for the 200 level group because my impression is that the 100 level was essentially for slower or non-street specific bikes. Upon arrival, after seeing the bikes and riders with 200 level stickers I opted to change to the 100 level.
   * **The 100 level is fast, with a few novice riders in the mix.**
      * **The first session of the 100 level begins with a no-passing, moderate-paced ride around the track following a marshal who is outlining the race line.** 
      * **After the first lap, the marshal continues to ride the line at an increasing pace for the remainder of the session. Riders can choose to follow, or pass and ride at their own pace.**
   * **The 200 level is for experienced riders who regularly hit 110+ mph on the straightaways. These riders often had track specific bikes and sometimes even ran slicks + tire warmers.**
   * **The 300 level consisted of very advanced track riders and/or retired racers. It was very fast.**

**On Track Day**

* Check-in and bike inspection is available starting at 7 am as indicated on the website.
* Also as indicated on their site, at \~7:40 am 2Fast provided a track ride around in the back of a pickup truck. 
   * They drove along the race line in the direction of travel for the day. 
   * They stopped along the way outlining details specific to turns as well as providing tips on how to handle areas where riders often make mistakes resulting in riding off the track or crashing.
   * **I highly recommend doing the track preview, even if you have ridden the track before. Coaches cover track conditions and observations from recent sessions including info about the surface.**
* Check in process: Find the 2Fast tent where breakfast is and find someone who looks to be handling paperwork. They probably wear 2Fast shirts but it was very cold so everyone had coats on. The staff will provide you with the check in sheet to sign, and a Tech Sheet to have your bike inspected. 
   * You can bring your bike to the tent area for inspection, but there's also a tech walking the paddock area. A tech came with me after I signed in and checked my bike where I was parked.
* Once you have a completed tech sheet, you bring it to the tent and get your sticker for the day.
   * if you're doing multiple days, your sticker indicates this so there's no need to do it again
   * If you plan to potentially ride multiple bikes, each one needs to pass inspection
   * Place the sticker someplace easily visible on the front of your bike. I'd place it on something you taped off for easier removal later. Alternatively, some riders place them on the bottom of their windscreen and accrue them as they attend.
   * Coarse officials check this sticker each time you line up to start your session, so leave it on your bike for the duration of the day(s).
* The person leading the track day didn't introduce himself at the beginning of the Rider's Meeting or explain where to find him throughout the day if you had questions.
   * They did introduce the ORP site manager as well as one of the techs and one of the coaches. I was able to find them later to clarify session start times etc.
   * The person that managed the tent also cooked lunch, so try to get any questions answered early in the day.
* The flags, pit lane speeds, and crash recovery info is covered verbally during the rider's meeting but was not otherwise documented anywhere for future reference.
   * I had trouble remembering how they used the flags; it differed from other track days I've attended.
   * I'd bring a pen and notebook or take notes on your phone if you are a visual learner.
   * There was no explanation of the flagger waving riders onto the track from the pit lane. It was very confusing and frankly distracting. 
      * They were stationed right where there's a turn in the pit lane. I didn't know what their hand signals indicated so I focused on entering the track on the near side and staying wide for the first turn.
* 2Fast provided printed color maps of the track including the race line and turn numbers.
* 2Fast provided coffee and Costco style pastries for breakfast as well as potato salad and BBQ'ed hot dogs / hamburgers for lunch. They also provided bottled water.
   * There was no vegetarian / vegan option (which I wouldn't expect). If you have special dietary requirements be sure to bring your own food.
* A large air horn was used to provide a 5 minute warning prior to the start of each session. It sounded once for level 100, twice for 200 and three times for 300.
   * I couldn't hear this from my location at the far end of the paddock, but my session started on time every 40 min so this was not really an issue.
* 2Fast kept to the schedule and did a great job responding to rider incidents throughout the day.
   * However, the flaggers randomly disappeared throughout my session.
   * I thought I saw a flagger start waving a red flag just as I passed one station, but the next station had a standing red flag and the following station had no-one so I wasn't sure what to do.
* It's common practice for 2Fast to run clockwise on Saturday and counter-clockwise on Sunday.
   * Some riders I spoke with indicated that this was not always the case and that you often have to wait until the morning Rider's Meeting to find out for certain.
* 1 day of 2Fast coaching was $500. However, there are coaches and marshals available to help you learn the line and take you around the track at an increasing pace to outline the breaking zones and turn in points etc.
   * These officials had mirrors to observe you as well as exposed tail lights so you could observe where they braked.
   * They also tended to exaggerate their body position so I knew when to transition in the seat and the direction of the upcoming turn (when it was a blind turn.)
* Admittedly, I didn't know the racing line very well during the first two sessions. A coach identified this and helped me and another rider with a guided ride during the next session.

**For reference: My experience level and equipment.**

* I started riding in 2019.
   * I took the initial Team Oregon class and riding training session. I then took the followup ""Advanced Rider Training"" riding course.
* I'm not an experienced track rider.
   * This was my 4th track day.
   * I did my first two track days through the California Superbike School training and coaching sessions on back to back days for levels 1 and 2 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
   * I did a followup track day with them a year later covering Level 3 at The Ridge.
   * I've watched the Yamaha Champions Riding School online curriculum twice.
* I ride a stock K46 BMW s1000rr with a slip on exhaust.
   * I use the Sport rider mode with the default settings.
* I wear track specific gear:
   * A one piece leather suite, a matching back protector and track boots, gauntlet gloves and an aerodynamic helmet designed for a crouched position.

# Training

A little hodge-podge here. I wanted a new approach. I have had several races gone wrong with obscure training philosophies. So it was a lot of reading and learning to tailor my body to my goals and learn what works for me instead of following a paid plan. Don't get me wrong, I still purchased a plan and followed a couple as sheer guidelines and learned what made my body feel good. I had one thing in mind while training: the race is the celebration, the training is reason we celebrate.

Overall, I adopted the Hansons Methodology as this is where my body, mind, and soul kept drifting back to. I felt great whenever I followed their process. Tired as all hell, but this adventure has brought me to the most fun I have had while training. Cannot thank them enough for their ideology and explanations of how and why to train.

The taper was weird, as with most new training plans. But for the first time, I was able to trust the process and succeed.

Final thought while training: I did a year and a half of IM's prior to 2025 and I was sooooo fed up with the endless subscriptions and paying for this and paying for that. I really wanted to pay to learn vs paying a service to get me across the finish line. I really buy into the idea to train to adapt vs train to survive. Thats why we do these crazy things!

# Pre-race

Week before my 4yo gave me a nasty full cough that thankfully with A LOT of Zicam and rest I was able to dry up and finally get some good rest the night before. Not ideal, and I was ready to accept the consequences of my race. I still woke up with a great nights rest (finally) and continued with my pre-race setup. Macros the week leading up were upped to about 60:25:15 (C:P:F). Morning of I did my usual peanut butter and banana sandwich while sipping on my LMNT Chocolate and Coffee. Drank about 10oz of water and 6oz of Gatorade up until race start. 15mins prior I ate my final snack: 1/2 portion of Starburst for something chewy before sucking on gels and water for 3+hrs.

# Race

Setup my Garmin PacePro plan against elevation as a new tactic. Not exactly negative split, but overall a good strategy to conquer some hills.

Miles 1-10 were a breeze. I banked arguably a little too much time against my Garmin. But I knew in the later part of the race I was going to have 5+ miles with a north wind and an extended elevation gain.

Miles 11-20 was time to settle in. Enjoy the time and knew that the race really started at mile 20. I was sucking on gels about every 4miles and realized through here that I need to up that to every 3miles or every 5k in the future. Energy was dropping at the end of every 4miles.

THE FINAL 10K I was dropping in energy big time. Switched to taking my final 2 gels at 19 and 22 with a Maurten 100 plus caffeine for the final push. LIVE. SAVER. Also, thank you to the 3:15 pacer who finally caught up with me and gave me some final words of encouragement to maintain where I was at.

This was essentially my first race where I was going for a rough and fast PR and only had been taking the race as it was in the past. My PR before this was 3:44:xx and this was a HUGE stepping stone.

# Post-race

I thanked that 3:15 pacer again. Cannot say that enough. I rang that PR bell with gusto and proceeded to enjoy the post-race festivities sporting my shiny new medal and a beer in hand.

My goals going forward are to recover for 4wks. Get back into another fabulous and devoted Hansons plan. I have another 26.2 in September where I would love to push sub 3:10 or 3:05. Still unsure whether I will go after that or take it as a half in stride with going after a BQ in January at Disney 2026.

Thank you all for reading!

1kqq4fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/RiceCookerJunkie/comments/1kqq4fw/owala_freesip_insulated_stainless_steel_water/,Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Straw Review,"# The Ultimate Hydration Companion: A Chef's Review of the Owala FreeSip Water Bottle

As a professional chef who spends endless hours in hot kitchens, finding the perfect water bottle isn't just a convenience—it's essential for survival. After years of bottles that leaked onto prep stations, couldn't maintain temperature through a dinner service, or were impossible to drink from one-handed while plating, I've finally found my match in the Owala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle.

## The Design: Form Meets Function in the Kitchen

The Owala FreeSip combines sleek aesthetics with practical design that works perfectly in a demanding culinary environment. Its modern, curved shape feels substantial without being cumbersome, even during the most hectic service periods.

What truly sets this bottle apart is the ingenious FreeSip lid system that offers two drinking options:
* **Built-in straw mode** - Perfect for quick sips while keeping both eyes on that delicate sauce reduction
* **Traditional spout mode** - Ideal for between-service gulps when you need serious hydration fast

The push-button opening mechanism is both satisfying and practical—it can be operated with one hand or even an elbow when your hands are covered in prep work. The carrying loop doubles as a lock, preventing any catastrophic spills near your mise en place.

## Performance That Stands Up to Kitchen Heat

After weeks of testing through long shifts, I can confidently report that the insulation performance is extraordinary. I filled it with ice water before morning prep, and despite sitting near hot ranges and ovens all day, I still found ice cubes floating at the end of service—8+ hours later!

The leak-proof promise holds true when tossed in my bag alongside notebooks and tools. The straw delivers a smooth, consistent flow without that frustrating ""fighting for liquid"" experience some bottles give.

## Specifications

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Capacity | 24 oz (710 ml) |
| Material | 18/8 Stainless Steel, BPA-free plastic |
| Insulation | Double-wall vacuum insulation |
| Cold Retention | Up to 24 hours |
| Dimensions | Approx. 10.5"" height, 3"" diameter |
| Weight | 14.4 oz (empty) |
| Special Features | Dual-drinking mechanism, carrying loop/lock |
| Dishwasher Safe | Lid: Yes (top rack), Body: Handwashing recommended |

## The Pros

* Exceptional insulation that withstands kitchen heat
* Genuinely leak-proof design protects your workspace
* Versatile drinking options for different kitchen scenarios
* One-handed operation perfect for busy chefs
* Protective cover keeps mouthpiece clean in messy environments
* Durable construction that stands up to daily abuse
* Wide mouth makes adding ice easy and cleaning thorough

## The Cons

* Multiple lid components require detailed cleaning
* Occasional gurgling sound when nearly empty
* Not suitable for hot beverages (stick to your chef's coffee mug)
* Premium price point compared to basic options
* Wider base might not fit standard car cup holders

## Is It Worth It?

For culinary professionals or anyone who needs reliable hydration through demanding physical activities, the Owala FreeSip is absolutely worth the investment. The thoughtful design addresses nearly every pain point I've experienced with other bottles, and its performance in temperature retention is unmatched in my experience.

At around $30-35, it's certainly more expensive than basic options, but the durability and functionality make it a worthwhile investment for something you'll use daily. I've found myself drinking more water throughout my shifts simply because it's so convenient and pleasant to use—leading to better focus and endurance during those marathon cooking sessions.

If you're tired of lukewarm water and frustrating designs, this might be the kitchen upgrade you didn't know you needed.

1kqq402,https://www.reddit.com/r/RiticWrites/comments/1kqq402/thmthm_happy_birthday_lens_of_justice/,"[THM][THM] Happy Birthday, Lens of Justice!","**\[WP\] When the lonley hero send the invites he never expected his enemies to actualy show up, They even brought gifts.**

  
As the door opened we all screamed happy birthday as loud as we could. Even behind the mask, I could see Len's eyes widen. Two cowls, and all my hench in full costume, in his apartment? Yeah, I totally get why he was panicking. Cyndthia was already drawing him inside and closing the door. Len was absolutely bewildered as Deady and I approached him.

My costume made it look like I was a cyborg undead cowboy. Well, it was obviously a high-tech mask, but that didn't change the fact that there was a party horn in my mouth. I blew it once before Deaddy clapped Len's shoulder.

""41!"" Deaddy laughed as he drew Len over to the couch, forcing the hero to settle down. ""How's it feel to be vanguard for the younger ones?""

""Uh..."" Len seemed even more confused.

I flopped down next to Len as Bill brought over a slice of cake for the poor guy. ""Len!"" My voice, as always, was a shrill cackle, but so long as the mask was on, I didn't drop character. ""Come on, Len! You invited us! We couldn't come to the party when there might be other capes there!""

Len was still looking around, half scared and half confused, even as Deaddy forced a beer into his hand. ""I didn't think... you would...""

""Listen, man."" Deaddy handed me a beer before settling down and cracked open his own. ""Some time back, won't tell you when because it might out me, you were doing one of those bullshit school things, trying to teach kids a thing or two. And it stuck. One of my kids saved a life a while after that. My kid. Saving a life. I've never been more proud.""

Big Deaddy had a fearsome name and appearance, but there was a reason why the two of us got along. Dad at 16, manned up and went full in on helping raise the kid. Two more by 19. Single father by 20. Became a hench to make ends meet; sad when that's legitimately the best way to raise kids by yourself. As Lisa could attest to. He'd been mistaken for a full cowl, which led to him going solo after the whole Shifter Virus thing. Big Deaddy wasn't a big name in the cowl scene, but he was solid and followed the same ethos as I did. If he was going to be a criminal, he was going to be a decent criminal. I'd picked up on his pattern quick, and we'd become good friends. Turns out, he was a dad through and through... even if he looked like he'd be ripping kids apart and eating them.

Meanwhile, Len wasn't just cursed with the short end of the stick when it came to names. He was your typical reservist cape. Always paraded out whenever they needed to show off a cape with not even a gray mark on his record, but that was partially because he had such a low record to start with beyond his lengthy service. Even the traffic cops didn't give him respect, though he was damn good with handling the cleanup between a tangle between capes and cowls. While his main power was creating weak barriers, I always suspected that he had a weak mesmer power that he kept hidden which let him dampen trauma.

If he did, I couldn't feel it right now. Right now, all I felt was the draining fear and the increasing confusion.

I cackled madly. ""Len, my friend. You put word out in the verified capes-and-cowls forum of the party. You're one of **my** heroes."" I always played up the fact that this was my city and therefore everything and everyone belonged to me. Part of my gimmick. ""You might not be a glitz and glam hero, but I see what you do for my people.""

""More people than you think do,"" Deaddy agreed. ""I bet that party was flooded.""

Len's head dropped a hair. I felt the self-loathing within him. With this little time near him, I could only get the strong emotions, and I'd need way more time than we'd allotted to dampen them. ""Um... No, nobody came.""

""**WHAT??**"" My mask was expressive enough that I was sure that he could see my shock.

Big Deaddy looked at me. ""Azure's out of town, and you know she woulda come.""

I nodded a little. ""Mart's patrolling the west side tonight, and he always has good things to say about Len. Quast just had that thing in the arroyo with Murderbeam, he's probably going to be laid out for weeks.""

""And if he's out, then you know all the patrols are messed up."" Deaddy frowned as he took a slug of beer. ""Still doesn't explain the independents. At least one of them should have shown up."" He looked to Len. ""You've done a ton for the independents! I remember that speech you gave the council about their reimbursement.""

""NO MATTER!"" I sat up straight. ""You put out the call, and I don't care if the other cowls didn't show up, you are valued enough my good sir to deserve a visit from the best!""

Okay, I was getting to be a household name but I wasn't on the level of Windrise yet, and Big Deaddy... Well, he would probably be on Windrise's level if he had the slightest shred of ambition beyond getting his kids into college. But you maintain your image, and overwhelming hubris was part of my image.

""That's right."" As Big Deaddy talked, I guzzled my beer. Short on time. ""We brought you presents.""

""We all did,"" Bill said, gesturing towards the kitchen. My persona was the sort that normally didn't let my hench address capes, but Bill had asked in advance so I was going to allow it. He didn't say why, and I didn't ask. You have to show some respect to your hench or they'll tell the Henchman's Guild that they want a new job. ""We wanted to wait for your Douglas Addams year, but since you put out the invite...""

Big Deaddy nodded, grinning from ear to ear. ""Most of them are in the kitchen, but, uh... I'll be honest. I got you a bed. I figured on your salary, you couldn't afford a new one, and let's be honest here. You and me? We aren't getting younger. If we want to stay in the game, we need to take care of ourselves. And a good night's sleep is key.""

I couldn't see Len's eyes, but I could tell a suspicious look even behind the mask. ""And what place did you rob it from?""

I cackled again. ""That wouldn't be in the spirit of giving a gift to a cape, now would it? Sure, we might have stolen the *money* we used to buy it, but we wouldn't steal the things themselves!""

Deaddy nodded. ""And we know that you'll probably just report it, conflict of interest and all that, but... If only for one night, you deserve something nice.""

Bill approached, holding out a piece of paper. ""Mine's... a little different. We, uh... We figured out where you live because you kept accidentally tagging it on LiveScribe when you'd do your daily affirmations, and I kinda... found out a thing or two."" He waited until Len put the untouched cake and beer on the coffee table and took the note. ""It's a bar, yeah, but they do ID checks and let minors in, so there's non-alcoholic stuff if you want. But it's also a pinball arcade, and on Fridays you get 40 plays for free if you're a Verified cape or cowl on SpandexNet. Uh, it's all anonymous, so no outing yourself. But I scouted the place, and it...""

My persona didn't smile more than the usual manic grin, but inside I was smiling from ear to ear. This wasn't just a cape, this was Bill's personal hero. I knew Bill well enough to feel the sorrow, pride, and hope washing inside of him. This was... something marvelous to feel in someone else.

""...It's still small, it's a small group of regulars. Even if they don't know you're a cape or anything, it's going to be real easy for you to make some friends there.""

Big Deaddy patted Len's shoulder. ""Once you hit 30, it's harder to make new friends. You should go. None of us are going to frequent it, but you deserve a place to hang out."" He glanced at me, and I nodded. Unlike me, he kept his beer as he stood. ""But, as much as we'd like to do... whatever it is that normal people do at our age at birthday parties, but we have places to be.""

Len almost panicked as we both stood, and all 12 of my hench made our way towards the door. ""Are you--""

I stopped him with an over-dramatic gesture with my hand. ""Relax. It's your *birthday*. No crimes from either of us. No, some of Headdy's goons from Trust City are trying to make a move into town. They've gone under your radar, but we aren't letting a group like that into my town. We're going to have a little talk with them--""

""With our fists,"" Deaddy clarified.

""--and make sure that you don't have to deal with a bunch of people who don't mind making use of firebombs. You have yourself a great rest of your evening!"" I hesitated, somehow making it sound like a dramatic pause.

""And remember. You beat us once. Didn't capture, lost the fight, but we both agreed that you beat us. If that bank heist hadn't been going down, you would have stopped us in our tracks long enough for backup to arrive, and with two on one? With one of them being me?! That's impressive! You've never done anything to ruin your image, and might not have the flash of other capes... but you've probably saved more lives than all of them combined. Take care, my cape, and remember, Strength in Bravery!"" The motto of the local cape office.

Len was still confused as hell as we made our way out, as I teleported us all away. But no matter how it went with Heddy's goons, today was one of the good days. We needed more capes like Len, and Len needed to know that someone, somewhere adored him. Even if it was a couple of cowls and a bunch of hench.

Miles 1-10 were a breeze. I banked arguably a little too much time against my Garmin. But I knew in the later part of the race I was going to have 5+ miles with a north wind and an extended elevation gain. 

Miles 11-20 was time to settle in. Enjoy the time and knew that the race really started at mile 20. I was sucking on gels about every 4miles and realized through here that I need to up that to every 3miles or every 5k in the future. Energy was dropping at the end of every 4miles. 

THE FINAL 10K I was dropping in energy big time. Switched to taking my final 2 gels at 19 and 22 with a Maurten 100 plus caffeine for the final push. LIVE. SAVER. Also, thank you to the 3:15 pacer who finally caught up with me and gave me some final words of encouragement to maintain where I was at. 

This was essentially my first race where I was going for a rough and fast PR and only had been taking the race as it was in the past. My PR before this was 3:44:xx and this was a HUGE stepping stone.

# Post-race

I thanked that 3:15 pacer again. Cannot say that enough. I rang that PR bell with gusto and proceeded to enjoy the post-race festivities sporting my shiny new medal and a beer in hand. 

My goals going forward are to recover for 4wks. Get back into another fabulous and devoted Hansons plan. I have another 26.2 in September where I would love to push sub 3:10 or 3:05. Still unsure whether I will go after that or take it as a half in stride with going after a BQ in January at Disney 2026. 

Thank you all for reading!

We have a toddler, 1m, who we love deeply. He’s all we ever talk about. Last fathers day I made him a keychain with the imprint of our sons foot on it and a mug with their photos on it. He didnt use either for a few months, so much so, he didnt even move it from where he placed it (in the bedroom). I felt bad about it cause i felt like he didnt like it. Then, when i put the keychain on his keys, he lost it 3 weeks later and has continued to blame me for losing it. 
I was excited for mothers day! I loved the idea of getting to spend the day together and was excited to see flowers and a coffee, at least. I didnt get either. It wasnt until i eventually caved and asked him to buy me a coffee that he did (i ran out of creamer). Later that night i eventually asked him why he didnt get me anything. I told him i dont want anything extravagant i was just hoping for something to remember this by. Like a silly drawing on a homemade card or a craft or something. He told me it was because he didnt know what to do or what to get. And for the flowers; he wanted to take our son to grab some, but he changed his mind after he saw him sleeping. It felt like an excuse to me. I told him that, that i felt like he didnt even do the bare minimum and that bothered me. To which he complained that his keychain is still missing and that i havent even bothered looking for it. 
Its been a few weeks, and its still on my mind. It felt like he didnt care about me. 
Our anniversary is in two days and now I dont even know if its worth even getting him a gift because i doubt he’ll do the same for me. Im not materialistic but i am sentimental so stuff like that matters to me. Am i over reacting? Should i still get him a gift? ",22,1747696048.0,TwoHotTakes,37,1.0,False

1kqpzjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OldCommission5402/comments/1kqpzjs/we_talked/,We talked,"So I just got back to my parents place after an extremely long day. I was able to get in with my OB and get another round of birth control, I spoke with the divorce attorney and went to the bank and transfered half of the joint account into my individual account. EX and I met up for lunch as well with my parents present at another table to keep watch. We talked and he told me a lot of truths that he had been harboring inside him for years. 

He elaborated about what he said in the voicemail that he has secretly been visiting his mom while he was supposed to be at work. Per her demands, using guilt trips and manipulation to get him to bend to her will.

He had been skipping work and going straight to her house once or sometimes twice a week to cater to her. At first the visits were casual and they would talk and have coffee. Eventually it progressed into physical things like a lot of hugging and cuddling on the couch and watching TV. 

If she were in the kitchen or the bathroom she would call for him to check her phone for **messages** she was expecting only to have naked pictures of her on the screen and she would ask him if she looked good without clothes on. He would get uncomfortable and tell her he didn't want to see that she would get upset with him and start yelling at him. 

During one visit she tried to sit in his lap and make him hold her, he got angry and told her to get off. She began hitting him and ripping his shirt as she was screaming at him that he was a horrible son and he must hate her and she wanted to harm herself. 

She would refer to him by his father's name sometimes and when he would tell her he wasn't his father, she would brush it off and say she meant to say his own name then tell him to be a good boy and help her with whatever she wanted him to do. Household chores, cooking her food, massaging her shoulders or cuddling with her to name a few.

She would routinely ask him about his and my sex life and asked about kids. He told her that we hadn't really tried for children and she would demand that he get me pregnant as soon as possible so she could become a grandmother. She would then ask creepy questions about what their children would look like if they had any. It then got to a point where she would demand to check his genitals to make sure he was **healthy**. He'd refuse of course and she'd react by screaming, hitting and threats of self harm.

The longer I Iistened to the absolute lunacy coming out of his mouth, I was growing more and more disgusted. I asked him how long this had been going on for and he said for 4 years.

He then admitted that she stole my birth control and dumped it into the toilet before we had got there yesterday, which was why I couldn't find it when I was packing my things. I didn't think it was important as sometimes I forget to take it so it wasn't on my mind at the time. He told me that she hadn't counted on my parents coming with me and they had ruined her plan to corner me and pressure me into taking EX back and getting pregnant ASAP. Even if that were to happen, there is no way in hell I would ever allow that monster around any child I would have.

After we sat in silence for a while he asked about our marriage. I said that it wasn't important right now but that I don't think us being together is healthy and I am still hurt by how he treated me for her. He said he was afraid of her and that he thought he had no choice. I told him he always had a choice and catering to her for 4 years like this has emboldened her to disregard the fucking law. She believes that she is untouchable and he has allowed her to believe it and even though he is a victim of sexual abuse by her, he could and **should** have ended it by going to the police a long time ago. 

He started crying and said I didn't understand the fear he felt. I said I would help him in anyway I could but I will not resume our marriage with him as it was. We will live separate lives apart from one another and there will be no cohabitating until I say so. **IF** I say so. I do not want there to be any **accidents** where I might fall pregnant. I also stipulated that he **will** get into therapy to help him get through his issues. He tried to argue about living together but I said if he didn't respect how I felt then I would be forced to wash my hands of all of this and proceed with the divorce as I originally planned. He agreed and dropped it.

After we ate, we went to the police station. With some gentle words of encouragement he told the police everything. He provided texts and voicemails that he still had on his phone as evidence and I did the same. They will be opening an investigation and has given EX the number for a victim's advocate and a list of therapists. Because this is 100% sexual abuse. It may not have resulted in them sleeping together but the detective said that if it continued, it would definitely happen. She had been methodically and emotionally breaking EX down since he was a child. 

We were able to get to the district court commissioner's office and apply for PPO. After EX detailed the abuse and said he is in fear for mine and his safety, it has been granted temporarily. We will require an actual court hearing to determine the duration of the PPO and we're hoping to go for the maximum time allowed. 

I did expect some resistance from EX but he is surprisingly on board. I told him if he is just going to back out and go running back to her then this will be the end of any interaction I have with him going forward. He assured me that he had no intention of backing out and he was ready to stand up to her. I'm skeptical but we'll see what happens. 

In case you are wondering, yes BB has been calling EX all day, blowing up his phone and demanding to know where he is. She's tried calling me as well but I never answered. Out of concern she might show up to the house, EX will be staying in a hotel for a few days until BB can be served with the order. We know she will contest it and I am counting on it. I have years worth of proof and witness testimony to nail her flabby 56 year old ass to the wall.",21,1747695897.0,u_OldCommission5402,8,1.0,False

Hey everyone,

I’m planning to spend some time in Jeddah and would love to connect with locals or expats who are open to meeting new people. I’m interested in learning more about Saudi culture, enjoying great food, and making some genuine connections along the way.

If anyone’s up for coffee, conversation, or showing me the hidden gems of Jeddah, feel free to reach out or drop a comment. I’m also open to some fun, casual hangouts — if the vibe’s right, we can see where things go.

Always up for good company and open-minded chats!

Looking forward to hearing from you 🙌

Like, real ones. People to laugh with, study with, go for late-night food runs or just chill and talk about life.

Life feels kinda heavy lately. I’ve been trying to keep it together, but I keep coming back to the same thought: I need connection. Not just “Hey, how are you?” in passing, but something real. If you’ve ever felt that same ache, I see you.

So I’m putting this out there: if you’re looking for a friend, someone to talk to, hang out with on campus, grab a coffee, rant about classes, or even just sit in comfy silence—I’m here.

Let’s break the silence. Let’s stop scrolling past each other like ghosts. DM me or drop a comment. Maybe we’ll be exactly what each other needs.

Hope starts with something small—like this post.

Much love,
Someone who’s ready to meet their people 🤍

1kqpwt2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kqpwt2,Watches and coffee - these are a few of my favorite things,"Long time lurker that sat on the waitlist for about a year and then made the call (trusted grey) 🤡.   
  
Spend at my AD was \~5000 in the past year and I figured I would get the call within the year and told myself that would be the most I was willing to wait. (I wanted the AD experience, didn't want to contribute to the secondary market, extra confidence that the watch was legit, etc etc)

On one hand it made me really reflect whether I really wanted the watch - on the other hand this is the one Rolex I knew I always wanted, my favorite dive watch by far and probably should of gotten it as soon as the post-covid hype had died down.  
  
Lesson learned? 

* Put your name down at more than one AD - where I live there's only two distinct chains... So not sure how much this matters/not sure if putting your name down at multiple ADs of the same chain will help -  I'm sure they have some sort of shared database. But I should of at least talked to the second AD chain...
* Don't buy substitute watches. I bought two watches to ""scratch the itch"" of the sub and I regretted one of those purchases enough to sell it back at a big loss a year later (lost 4.5k plus sales tax). 
   * The second watch I love dearly and it's my main daily (Tudor BB 58 GMT) but it didn't satisfy the sub itch. ",7,1747695687.0,rolex,3,1.0,False
