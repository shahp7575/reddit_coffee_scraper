1ndih7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1ndih7p/the_churchs_value_proposition/,The church’s Value Proposition,"While studying marketing and market differentiation, theres a term called value proposition; basically the answer to what makes someone’s time and money worth investing towards you or your Service/Product. 

Turning this towards our favorite corporation, I’ve lost track of what value proposition the church is supposed to give us. 

Is it having the gift of the Holy Ghost? Well no, because other Christian churches offer that too, Plenty of people will strongly testify of that. Maybe it’s having it with you always? Well no, because the spirit will leave you if you sin, or go into a coffee shop or bar. What use is an always-present spirit if it cannot follow you 24/7?

Is it eternal salvation? Well numerous other religions offer that too, and with similar evidence to back up their claims that the church does. Plus it’s much easier to go to a born-again church and get your “Get out of Hell-free” card punched at a baptism. 

Oh, but what about eternal families? Sure, but you best read the fine print on that. If someone in your family decides to leave, there goes your eternal family. Also let’s not forget that spiritual polygamy exists, so a husband that tragically died earlier in life will still be separated from his   Wife if she decides to remarry, especially to someone who demands a temple marriage. 
(Plus, I’m not sure about the theology of this, but in the normal Christian idea of heaven, wouldn’t you be able to go find your family anyways? What does eternal bonds get you anyway)

Thanks for sticking around for this long, but did I miss anything? Is there a legitimate value proposition the church offers?",3,1757520609.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

1ndifkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ndifkk/i_brought_home_a_souvenir_from_egypt_now_my_cat/,I brought home a souvenir from Egypt. Now my cat is talking to me.,"A week after I got back from my trip to Egypt, my cat, Richard, started talking to me. 

“Hello, Ivan,” he said, after I walked into the apartment after work.

“Hi Richard,” I said. Then I realized what had just happened, though, and I dropped my laptop on the floor. “Did you just talk?”

“I did.”

“How is that possible?”

“I’m not sure.”

Richard and I sat on the couch and tried to figure out what had happened. I’d recently returned from a work trip to Cairo. While walking through Khan el-Khalili bazaar, a wooden statue caught my attention. The statue was a foot tall and depicted a mummified man standing with his arms crossed over his chest. The wood felt unexpectedly heavy in my hands, almost warm despite the cool air. The detail in the man's face was incredible. I could even see the small wrinkles around his eyes. He almost looked real.

I asked the vendor how much the statue cost. I worried he’d say hundreds, but when told me he only wanted twenty U.S. dollars, I bought the statue and took it home as a souvenir. I put it on my TV stand, next to my TV.   

“I’ve felt strange ever since you brought the statue home,” Richard said. 

“Do you think it has something to do with why you can talk now?”

“I’ve always had thoughts but when you brought this statue home, I started thinking in English. I’ve never thought in English before. I never wanted to speak, either, but now I do.”

“The person who sold me the statue said it was an Ushebti statue. He said they’re usually found in tombs, but this statue had been carved by a local. It was art, not a piece of history.”

I picked up the statue and looked at it more closely. The wood felt oily. I noticed tiny cracks running the wood, too, like veins, and layers of light and dark red coloring that shifted in the light. Maybe the statue was much older than I’d thought it was.

It took a while for me to get used to Richard being able to talk, but once I got over the shock of it, I enjoyed our conversations. I didn’t have any friends. Usually, after work, I’d just go home and play videos games or watch TV. I still did that, but now I had someone else to talk to. Richard would ask me all kinds of questions about the world, and I’d do my best to answer him.

“Why do dogs hate us so much?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “I’ve never really thought about it. I guess they just do.”

“And if I eat this pizza, I’ll get sick?”

“Your stomach wasn’t made for it. Cats need to eat raw meat.”

At first, Richard seemed happy to spend time with me, too. As the weeks went on, though, he became irritated by my behavior, and he started criticizing me.

“Why don’t we go out for a walk?” he asked.

“I’m tired. I don’t feel like walking.

“Every day you come home, and you sit on the couch. You never do anything. You’re so lazy.”
Another time, I ordered pizza two nights in a row, and Richard gave me a look of pure disgust. 

“How can you eat like this?” he asked.

“I don’t feel like cooking.”

“Then order a salad. Order anything healthy for once.”

I began to resent Richard. I went out of my way to avoid him. Instead of coming home after work, I took his advice and started going to the gym. I lost nearly twenty pounds.

Richard started going out more, too. Each morning, before I left for work, he’d ask me to open the window. He’d spend the day exploring Chicago, not coming home until much later that night. Sometimes not until the next day.  

“What are you doing?” I asked him.

“Learning about the world,” he said.

The way he was acting made me feel uncomfortable. I don’t know exactly what it was. If it was how he talked, or how he reacted to me. He didn’t just seem resentful anymore. He seemed hateful. He seemed like he wanted to hurt me and hurt other people in the world, too. It was like he felt better than all of us, and the rest of us needed to be brought up to his standards.

In my free time, I started to research Ushebti statues. I learned that the Ushebti were magical servant statues buried with the dead. They awaken in the afterlife and perform work on behalf of the deceased, stepping in like their clone.

I tried talking to Richard about what the statue might be doing to him, but he wouldn’t listen to me. He just mocked me.

“You think this statue has somehow possessed me?” he asked.

“Cats don’t just start talking. Something is going on.”

“Did you ever think maybe I’m just smarter than other cats?”

“You’re talking, Richard. You’re reading Plato and Aristotle and Livy’s History of Rome. That’s not normal.”

I decided to try an experiment. One night, while Richard was gone, I took the statue down to my car. When Richard came home later that night, he was furious. He immediately woke me up, jumping on my bed and hissing my face.

“Where is it?” he yelled.

“I threw it out.”

“Then go get it.”

“Or what?”

“I’ll make you regret it.”

He’d never threatened me before. I’d believe his threat, too. He’d do whatever he could to hurt me.

I got the statue from my car and put it back beside my TV again. From then on, though, I kept my distance from Richard. Truthfully, I was scared of him. I had no idea what he was capable of.

“The people in this city are so boring,” he told me. “Every day, I’ve been watching them do the same things, again and again. No ambition, no dreams, nothing. Just millions of people, wasting away, wasting their lives.”

I’d finally had enough of him. “And what are you doing with your life?” I asked. “If ambition is so important to you, maybe you should go live somewhere else.”

“Are you kicking me out?”

“I think we’d both be happier if you didn’t live together anymore.”

Richard agreed.

I offered to help him move. Wherever he wanted to go, I’d find a way to get him there. He thanked me, but then he asked for some time to think about what he wanted to do next.

It was that same night, the nightmares started.

I dreamt I was lying in my bed when two, rotten arms reached up through my bedsheets and dragged me downward, through the bed and into an ocean of black water.

I flailed my limbs, struggling to breath, as I sank deeper and deeper.

I sensed other things around me, watching me. Not people. Something else. Sprits. Demons.

Their yellows eyes lit up the darkness.

I woke in my bed, covered in cold sweat, my heart beating painfully fast. Richard sat at the edge of my bed, watching me with the same yellow eyes.

“What are you doing here?” I asked him.

“I heard you scream. I came to make sure you were okay.”

“I’m fine.”

I wasn’t fine, though. I was even more frightened than before. I was desperate for help, too. What if whatever had taken a control of Richard’s mind really wanted control of me?

During my research into the Ushebti statue, I came across the profile of a professor of at the University of Chicago, Dr. Sarah Chen, an expert in Egyptology. I reached out to her by email, explaining what happened and attaching a video of Richard talking to me.

Dr. Chen agreed to meet me for coffee on the university campus. She arrived at the café with her hair tied in a ponytail, her eyes very visibly strained, and her hands smeared with blue ink.

“You swear that video is real?” she asked. “It isn’t AI or photoshop or something like that?”

“It’s 100% real. My cat can talk. He’s been talking to me ever since I brought that statue home. His behavior has changed, too. At first, he was kind friendly. Now, though, he acts like he wants me dead.”

“If what you say is true, I believe the Ushebti statue you brought home from Egypt had a spirit trapped inside of it.”

“A spirit?”

She nods. “Wealthy people were buried with hundreds of these statues. The dead person’s spirit was supposed to bring these statues to life to perform work on their behalf. Maybe that’s what happened. Whoever was buried with that statue, their soul has awakened it to accomplish something here.”

“What would this spirit want?”

“Power and wealth, possibly. Religious favor. Legacy and memory.” She sipped her coffee and thought for a moment. “If the statue has caused this problem, though, maybe destroying this statue would fix it.”

“How do I destroy it?”

“That’s not really my area of expertise, but if I were you, I would burn it. Don’t put out the fire until every bit of the statue has turned to ash.”

“And you’re sure that would help?”

“No, but I don’t know what else you can do.”

On my way home from the university, I stopped at store and bought an axe, a lighter, and some lighter fluid. I hid everything in the trunk of car, so Richard wouldn’t see it.

At home, Richard sat in the windowsill in the living room, flicking his tail. He seemed to know something was wrong.

“Why didn’t you go to work today?” he asked.

“I wasn’t feeling well.”

“Then why didn’t you stay home?”

“I had a few errands to run. It was just a fever.”

I tried walking to my room, but Richard jumped in front of me.

“You smell different. Someone’s perfume. Who were you talking to?”

“Nobody. Just a few cashiers. Maybe it’s one of their perfumes you’re smelling.”

“Maybe.”

I walked around him, sat on my bed, and turned on my bedroom TV. Every now then, I’d look at the door. I could see Richard paws moving as he paced back and forth.

“Are you staying home tonight, too?” I asked him

“It’s a little cold tonight.”

“Have you thought anymore about where you’d like to live next?”

“I have a few ideas. I’ll let you know soon.”

Later, I opened my door a crack. I didn’t seem him. I hoped he was sleeping.

I tiptoed towards the TV and then picked up the Ushebti statue.

Richard lunged at me, hissing. “Don’t you dare touch it!”

His claws dug into my face, ripping the skin. I grabbed onto him and threw him back onto the couch. Then I picked up the statue and ran out of my apartment, slamming the door shut behind me.

“You’ll regret this!” he screamed.

I ran downstairs and got into my car. I could feel the blood dripping down my cheeks. Thank God he hadn’t clawed my eyes.

Where can I burn this statue? I wondered. There’s on going back now.

I drove around aimlessly for an hour, but then I headed toward Chicago’s south side and parked in an alleyway next to an empty, graffiti-covered warehouse.

I looked around and didn’t see anyone else.

I got out of the car and opened the trunk.

In the distance, someone screamed, and I spun around. I was still alone, though. Nothing but buildings and shadows. The smoke from the smokestacks twisting through the sky.

I took out the axe and the lighter fluid. I swung the axe down on the statue, cutting it in half.  

Lightning flashed across the sky. In the distance, police sirens wailed.

I covered the two broken pieces of the statue with lighter fluid and set them on fire.

As soon as the flames lit up, the silence was ripped apart by a terrible scream. Rain began pouring from the sky.

My hands shook as I covered the flames with my jacket, protecting the flames until they’d grown large enough that the rain could no longer stop the statue from burning.

I watched as the wood turned to ash and then as the wind blew the ashes away. That awful statue was gone forever.

Please be over, I hoped. Please let Richard be okay.

The rain began falling harder. I got back in my car and drove back home with my windshield wipers squeaking loudly against the glass.

Inside my apartment, all the lights were off.

I turned the lights on. In front of the TV, blood was splattered on the carpet from where Richard had cut me.

Finally, I saw him. He jumped off the couch and meowed.

“Richard?” I asked. “Are you ok?”

He meows again.

I got on my knees. He walked towards me, and I pet his head.

“Do you understand what I’m saying?”

He sat, purring. I looked at his eyes. His eyes looked less yellow, too.

“I love you, Richard,” I said.

He walked to his water bowl and licked his water.

It was finally over.

I sat on the couch and turned on the TV. Richard jumped on my lap, and I started petting him again while he purred. But then, suddenly, icy fingers grabbed onto my shoulders. Before I could turn to see who it was, I was violently dragged backwards over the couch, my shins slamming into the coffee table. I clawed at the carpet as I was pulled across the floor and into the bedroom.  

“Help!” I screamed.

The bedroom door slammed shut behind me. In the darkness, whatever had grabbed me, threw me onto the bed. Two yellows eyes appeared in front of my face.

“You pathetic little man,” it hissed.

I pressed its cold hands into my chest. My heart froze. The bed turned to water, and then I began to fall through that same, cold black water again.

“Let go of me!” I yelled, and I tried to fight my way back to the surface before I drowned.

Then I heard Richard scratching at the door, trying to get in. The sound cut through the nightmare. Suddenly I could feel my bed beneath me again. I was gasping, soaked in sweat, but breathing air instead of that horrible water.

I went to the door and opened it. Richard looked up at me and meowed.

The apartment lights began flicker. I picked up Richard and carried him downstairs to my car. I drove around in circles the rest of the night, afraid to go back home.

“Have you been back to the apartment?” Dr. Chen asked me.

“Richard and I stayed at a hotel for the next week,” I said, “but then I started to run out of money, so we went home. Our first night there after what happened was a little frightening, but the apartment seems normal now.”

“You haven’t noticed anything strange?”

“Every now and then when I’m sleeping, I’ll wake up to a loud noise, but I think it’s just my imagination.  Honestly, I’m starting to wonder if I imagined this whole thing.”

“But you have the videos.”

“Those have changed, too. Look at this.” I take out my phone and play one of the videos for her. Richard looks at the camera and meows. “You heard him talking before, right?”

“I did.”

“Well, whatever proof I had is gone.”

“And Richard hasn’t talked since you destroyed the statue?”

“He hasn’t said a word.”

“Then destroying the statue must have worked.”

After saying goodbye to Dr. Chen, I drove home and ordered a pizza for dinner. Richard and I sat together on the couch, watching TV. He looked up at me, and I pet his head.

I’m happy things are back to normal now. But at night, while Richard sits at the edge of my bed, I can’t help but wonder what he’s thinking about, and how much of who he was before is still him. Sometimes, I wish I could get rid of him, but he’s my cat. He’s been my cat for seven years.

I can’t just abandon him.

Make my heart skip a beat like it does when I accidentally walk up/down a curb that I did not know was there. You get the gist of it… 

I lost my eyesight seven years ago, so it’s still relatively new. But I don’t let it stop me from enjoying this beautiful thing called life. That’s a big reason why I want to find something real , because sharing life with someone would be pretty rad. What’s the point of happiness if you can’t share it with someone else?

I’m in a really good place in my life. After losing my sight, I went back to school and pursued a new career path that has been very fulfilling. Now, I help people every day and run my own small business. That shit is pretty exciting lol.

I stay busy with work, hobbies, and the tribe of people I care about. You can often find me listening to music or podcasts, taking audiobook suggestions (that I probably won’t follow through on), getting out in nature … especially near the ocean, which is my favorite place , or playing the drums, because I’ve come to believe the guitar is a lie and no one can actually play it.

Family and friends are incredibly important to me, and I hope they’re a priority for you, too. I’ll never get jealous of you making time for the people who matter to you. These days, the only kind of jealousy I feel is toward people born on January 1st, 2000  because of how easy it is for them to do the math when someone asks their age.

Yes, physical attraction is important to some, but I seek more of a spiritual connection. I’m happy to send a photo if you’re interested. For reference, I’m a 6’2” white male with a shaved head, an amazing beard, and I fit into the chubby athletic/dad bod category. So what am I looking for? 
Monogamy is very important to me. I’m a loyal, caring, emotionally intelligent man who thrives on balance. I’m looking for a relationship built on communication, reciprocation, and a mutual desire to grow together… the kind where both people keep pouring into each other. Intentionality is a big part of my daily life, and I hope it is for you too.

If your life wouldn’t allow us to meet in person sometime in the near future, this might not be the right fit. I’m not looking for a purely online connection. Fortunately, my career gives me plenty of flexibility , even for relocation if the connection is right.

If you’ve got your life together and are looking for someone to complement it, we might get along really well. Bonus points if you prioritize your mental and physical health. I’m not looking for a fitness fanatic, but if you walk, run, go to the gym, or do anything that helps keep your mind and body healthy, that’s a great match. It’s even better if it’s something we can do together.

Perks of dating me include: •	Pre-boarding when traveling
	•	Excellent concert seats
	•	I will never look at another woman (literally)
	•	People being randomly super nice to us
	•	And every girl’s dream: owning a pony!
…Okay, maybe not a pony — but miniature horses as service animals are a real thing. 
As this wall of text comes to a close, I just want to say I hope everyone finds what they’re looking for in life. Happiness is absolutely a pursuit, but it’s also something we all deserve.

1ndidv5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ndidv5,Finishing touches help,"Hello talented people. I require some assistance please. 

I have been doing portraits for a few years now, mainly for friends and family. Whilst I am fairly happy with my progress, I struggle with really tying it together. 

I have aphantasia, which is why I focus on portraits as I can follow a reference, but I always leave the backgrounds blank in fear of messing them up (has happened before). so I always feel like they come out flat and, well, simple and lifeless. 

Any suggestions or ideas on what I could do to add a bit more flair to them - turn them into something that someone would really like to showcase in their house? Recently I thought of just adding coffee to the paper as a background of sorts, and drawing on top, so will give that a try. I have no art education and don't know anyone in the circle, so I feel like I've been doing this in a void that has stunted my overall creativity. Hopefully this forum could help with that.

Thank you!

I know what we'll be talking about at least initially, but i had some questions over just general stuff:

1. Plan atm is just going to a coffee shop initially, if it goes well there's a Thai place nearby to walk to. Anything else we'd have to drive, which im not sure if thats cool on a first date.

2. How should I greet her? Handshake feels really formal but a hug feels really forward, I dont really have a good perspective on this.

3. How long should I expect it to go, should I mostly just limit it to the coffee talk or is it worth having a lot of followup ideas planned?

4. Do i pay for both coffees?

5. What are things that are worth discussing on a first date, outside of just generally making conversation. Things along the lines of relationship expectations etc, or is that better for 2nd/3rd/so on?

6. Should we be talking every day before the date or is it better to skip some days? Im not really sure what etiquette is on this aspect.

Our family group chat used to be birthdays and baby pics. For months it’s been a barrage of Trump memes / forwarded clips / links to news articles. All of this is pro trump btw. I dont engage in the convo or react to anything but i view it daily and its kinda stessing me out. I did ask at dinner if we could just stop the constant commentry about Trump and they just laughed at me and said ""what you dont like Trump?"" even though they know i dont. My older brother specifically sniggered at this. I get the vibe him and my Dad have some purpose with this and know it will get to me. 


Last night i had enough. i couldnt sleep and then the constant pings on my phone of messages about trump just made me tilt. 

I said in the gc ""bye 👋"" 

Within minutes my brother messages me all this hate and made me pretty upset (screenshot attached). I told him the only topic in the GC is Trump and I’m not forcing my views on anyone, I just don’t want politics in the family space. He started to unload on me and being pretty horrible about my job and money situation etc. I did clap back once about his job (which I regret), but it felt awful to be attacked over leaving a chat.

Now I’m being told I’m “disrespectful” and ""causing drama within the family""

AOR for leaving the GC? idek what to do now...

tldr : family groupchat became constant Trump discussion. I asked for a politics free family group chat, got dismissed, so I left the chat. Brother messages me with insults (see screenshot).

We met through her cousin (32F), who I’ve known for about a month. We’re friends, not super close. She tried hitting on me but, sorry, no way. 

I followed her on Instagram very late at night that day (more like early morning). She accepted the request rightaway and messaged me saying “happy birthday, enjoy how drunk you are” with emojis and all. It was my birthday the next day. We chatted a bit a day later, I asked her out, and got her number. She responded quickly, wrote more than I do, and Instagram messaging was a bit flirty on my end. She definitely picked up on it.

We met that evening, but her cousin tagged along somehow, so it turned into more of a casual hang than a date. I’m fine with that btw, they live together, so I’m sure they were talking about me. I picked them up, we grabbed coffee, then hit the bar we all frequent. She was really sick, though, coughing so bad she could barely talk. But still went out the moment I asked her out. She got worse and had to leave early, calling a taxi. I offered a ride, but she told me to enjoy the rest of the night keeping company to her cousin.

The vibe wasn’t super flirty, but we all got to know each other better. She loved the jazz playlist in the car (I’d seen jazz on her IG story that day, so I played GTA 4’s jazz radio, great hack haha)

We didn’t talk the next day, so I texted her today asking if she was feeling better. I also mentioned that the last meet up was nice but cut short, and we should do it again.

She’s going on vacation in a few days and said, “feeling slightly better. Let’s talk after I get back” I said deal, and asked when she’d be back, but haven’t gotten a reply yet. Her tone felt a little distant, but maybe I’m overthinking it lol

1ndi96f,https://www.reddit.com/r/USAA/comments/1ndi96f/the_end/,The end,"Been with USAA for something approaching 30 years. The past few years our auto insurance rate has been steady climbing but I stuck with them. About a month ago I was rear ended by another USAA insured motorist (who then crossed into the oncoming lane of traffic and t-boned another driver), totaled my vehicle. The claim process was a nightmare. 

They charged me my deductible, I understand that is standard procedure except on their very own website it says in some cases where the other motorist is at fault and especially when both parties are covered by the same company, the deductible can be waived. I requested that it be waived and their response (actually within the 2 day advertised time frame) was that it is standard procedure to charge this then refund it once the other person is confirmed to be at fault. I pointed out their own statement on their website about waiving the fee when fault was clearly defined and the at fault motorist was also a USAA customer. It took them several days to actually remove the deductible fee. However, the total value of the claim did not go up. Like they didn't recalculate the total payment after removing the fee. This took a week or so of no responses to finally get it sorted. 

I had a brand new set of tires on my vehicle, installed 2 weeks before the accident, cost me $450 for the tires plus installation. The total loss statement said I would receive a $60 credit for my tires being in ""good"" condition. The first day of the claim process I had sent them the receipt for the purchase. About a week later (note: they claim 24-48 hour response time) they changed that $60 to $120 credit and said these credits may not match dollar for dollar to the cost of the item. 

The total loss statement said they removed $670 from the value of my vehicle because of heavily soiling and staining in the interior. I admit, the car needed vacuumed out... I have a gravel driveway. It had a worn spot on the driver floor mat. Maybe $250 in total costs for a deep clean and new floor mat. During the accident a large ice coffee flew out of the cup holder and went all over the interior. But USAA never addressed that, they ghosted me on responses for this issue until I gave up. I had been without a vehicle for nearly a month, relying on loaner cars from friends. I had to get the money to start the shopping process. 

I called to complain about the lack of communication and was told my case was being elevated to the adjuster's supervisor and to expect a call back ""soon"". I was never contacted by this mystery supervisor. I called several times about speaking to the supervisor. I was told the complaint was misfiled with the wrong date. I was told the complaint was not filed with the proper urgency status. I was told many other excuses. Each time the customer service thanked me for 30 years of loyalty and said how sorry they were this was happening. ""Sorry"" doesn't get me back and forth to work. 

The icing on the cake was when I gave up fighting the interior de-valuation, I told them to get me my money so I can replace the vehicle. I got an email the Thursday before Labor day saying I had been direct deposit paid an amount approximately $200 less than what my total loss claim was supposed to be. Unfortunately no money was in my account. I didn't actually receive the money until the next Tuesday mid-day. I called about the discrepancy in dollar amount and was basically told: Oopsie, that happens sometimes, we'll get it fixed and do a supplemental deposit ASAP. Guess what hasn't happened yet, over a week later? 

I called to cancel my insurance policy, stating how dissatisfied I was with the claim process and that I was going with another provider. They still took the policy payment out 1 more time. Now I have to call and see when this will be refunded as well as asking about the $200ish they still owe me from the total loss claim. ",2,1757520121.0,USAA,0,0.67,False

I start the day with a 1-hour swim. It's the one time my brain shuts up and doesn't throw ""new feature ideas"" at me. Thereafter, it's straight into dad mode (I've got 3 kids 😅). They're awesome and chaotic and also my daily reminder that sleep is optional.

Work-wise, I clock in around 9–10 hours. Right now the product is stable, but every day is feature tweaks, bug fixes, or security patching. September is my ""big update"" month, so most of my hours are spent building toward that. I handle everything, including the app, database, security, and deployment, with the exception of making coffee for myself, which I should probably automate.

Every 30 days, I try to step back and think of new product ideas or experiments. Sometimes they're excellent, sometimes they go straight into the ""maybe later"" pile, but it keeps me moving forward.

On top of tech, I also wear the ""content guy"" hat. Once a week, I write a blog, which involves selecting the topic, writing the content, editing it, creating images, and handling all related tasks (yes, with some AI help). A couple times a week, I’m handling posts for Twitter and LinkedIn. Twitter feels like shouting into an empty space, yet I try to respond to threads on a daily basis, with the hope that the void will respond. LinkedIn feels more structured.

The one thing I don't touch (thankfully) is sales. My co-founder runs that show, and honestly, without sales, I would just be another person building features no one asked for.

I usually finish the day with a 30-min brisk walk. No headphones, no screens...just walk. Sometimes that's when the best ideas show up.

So, that’s my day: swimming, coding, content, kids, a walk, family, repeat. I'm making slow, steady progress.

1ndi5i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingfeedback/comments/1ndi5i2/draft_attempt/,Draft Attempt,"📖 Chapter 1 — The Leaving (expanded draft, Part 1)

The door didn’t slam. That would have been too final, too dramatic. It only clicked, soft as a throat clearing, as if it understood she wasn’t ready. For a moment she kept her hand pressed against the handle, palm flat, breathing shallow, pretending she could reverse time just by holding on. She couldn’t.

The hallway smelled of plaster and old dinners. Her neighbors were cooking—garlic, onions, oil snapping in pans—mundane comforts that already felt like someone else’s life. She carried them with her, like scents get carried in hair, but they weren’t hers anymore. The walls were lined with faint pencil scratches from furniture dragged, from suitcases before hers, from lives that had left and never come back.

The suitcase was heavier than it should have been. Not with clothes—she didn’t pack much, folding them badly, half by habit, half in panic. The weight came from everything it represented: her house collapsed into fabric, zippers that caught on themselves, plastic wheels that squealed against the concrete floor. When she gripped the handle, the ridged plastic dug into her palm. She told herself it was a bruise she would be proud of.

Every step down the stairwell was loud, echoing. The suitcase thumped with each floor, announcing her departure to no one. Her chest carried two voices: one that whispered, keep going, and another, sharper, that sounded like her parents: don’t disappoint us. Don’t come back broken.

Outside, the night air was cold enough to bite her lips. She pulled her coat tighter, a second skin against the city that had already started to disown her. She repeated her rules under her breath: don’t trust anyone, don’t stop walking, don’t make eye contact too long, don’t vanish. Rules felt safer than hope.

At the bus stop, neon light washed her face pale. She watched strangers with bags bigger than hers, lives packed more carefully. She thought: maybe they’re running too. Maybe we’re all fugitives pretending to be travelers. When the bus hissed open, she climbed in without looking back. The city outside the window blurred into a movie she no longer starred in.

She practiced sentences in her head, ones she might need later: I live here now. I’m fine. I don’t need anything. The lies tasted rehearsed, already believable. She pressed her forehead to the glass, watching streets she knew by heart slip past like memories she’d already decided not to keep.

Chapter 2 — The First Taste

It began as a warmth around the edges, a late sun that pretended to be mercy. Not a shout, a murmur—attention that arrived like a hand on the shoulder you didn’t know was cold. A message at a careless hour. A compliment too direct to be safe. A laugh that unlocked a childhood memory of doors opening without questions.

You told yourself not to read into it. And then you read into it. The phone face lit your face. A small glow that argued with the dark corners of the room. You tried to say the words out loud—it’s nothing—but the body didn’t believe you. It made space for hope with the instinct of a host setting extra places at a table.

Days recalibrated themselves around the possibility of a sound. The buzz-beat-beep that said you mattered to someone else’s nervous system for three seconds. The world shrank to a screen and widened to a fantasy in the same movement. Good morning, beautiful—you could hold that in your mouth for hours like hard candy. You did not check for cavities.

There were misalignments you called charm. The answers that curved away from the question. Plans that dissolved when the air touched them. You forgave with the speed of rain evaporating from a hot pavement: no evidence left, just steam and the memory of wet. You believed you were patient. You believed patience was love’s instrument. You did not notice it had been tuned to someone else’s song.

You curated a life that could pass inspections. Work that took more of you than you had. Rituals so small they counted as faith: a specific mug, the lazy loop you walked around the block when the heart galloped, the window you opened to let the night in, as if it were safer outside your head. On shelves and in pockets you kept souvenirs no one else could identify—a bus ticket, a receipt, a button—each a breadcrumb back to a feeling.

You edited the story for friends. You cut the scenes where you waited. You highlighted the glitter—the accidental tenderness, the texts that landed exactly where you needed them, the sentence that made your spine remember it used to be a lighthouse. You didn’t lie. You just left out the weather warnings.

The body—loyal, inconvenient—kept a ledger anyway. The stomach that cramped after promises. The throat that closed before sleep. The hands that trembled when the phone stayed still long enough for honesty to arrive. You wrote private advisories on the inside of your lips: be careful, be careful, be careful. Then you kissed over them.

And when the first small absence came, it made a noise like something falling in the next room. You sat very still and told yourself it was nothing. But already a crack was measuring the wall, making lines only you could see.



Chapter 3 — The Drug

What you named love refined itself into dosage: attention as milligrams, absence as nausea. A ritual emerged and pretended to be devotion. You learned to metabolize uncertainty like a vitamin you couldn’t live without. You hid the side effects in tidy drawers: insomnia, skipped meals, the particular ache of waiting while pretending not to.

Friends thinned at the edges. They were not cruel; they were tired. You told the shorter version. You laughed at your own punchlines to keep them from worrying. You convinced yourself that endurance was intimacy—if you held out long enough, the shape of you would be recognized, the door would unlock, the bed would become two-sided and then one.

Losses arrived dressed as fate. A funeral where your mouth forgot how to speak without cracking. A family gathering where you smiled like a photograph—that is, as proof, not as feeling. Rooms kept losing their heat. The mirror failed at certain angles. The commute became a tunnel with no ad posters, only your reflection in the glass, multiplied and unpersuaded.

The night you dialed the helpline, you rehearsed a softer voice, the one that didn’t scare strangers. A human answered. Kind, perhaps. Scripted, certainly. The space between their questions and your answers filled with an air you could not breathe. You hung up empty-handed and heavier, like sadness had been poured back into you from a height.

What remained was a math problem you couldn’t solve: every time you added yourself up, something came out missing. The house became a set. The country became a coat two sizes too large. You sat on the edge of your bed and understood that gravity had a different plan for you than you had for yourself.

You packed the warnings into a suitcase and called it planning.


Chapter 4 — Collapse

There isn’t always an event. Sometimes collapse is a long hallway with the lights flickering out one by one until you forget you used to see. You fed yourself rules: show up, pay on time, keep the plants alive, return messages within a humane window. You thought structure could scaffold a soul. It can—for a while.

You became inventory: units of sleep, milliliters of water, miles walked to make the body forget what the mind remembered. You counted things because counting promised borders. Some nights the border held. Some nights you slipped under the fence and woke in a field with no language. You took notes to prove to yourself you’d been there. The notes frightened you when you read them in daylight. You stopped reading them in daylight.

Death grew nearer, not because the people you loved died (though that, too) but because the ordinary lost its voice. Bread tasted like compliance. Music like manipulation. The shower was a negotiation you sometimes lost. When you did laugh—it happened; sweetness is sneaky—you scanned the moment for traps, as if joy had a small print you kept missing.

When the door finally opened, it wasn’t a miracle so much as muscle memory: leave. You pulled the suitcase across an apartment that had learned to hold its breath. The passport warmed against your hip, a ticket and a talisman. You told no one who might stop you. You told someone who wouldn’t. You folded the last of your shirts and smelled your own fabric like it was the house saying goodbye.

Stations don’t care. That’s their mercy. Boards flip. Timetables insist on their own truth. You found a seat that allowed you to face backward. Watching where you’ve been is easier than watching where you’re going. The city unstitched itself in the window and did not bleed.

On the border, an officer stamped a page he did not read. Permission looks official when you need it to. You crossed because crossing was the only verb that didn’t accuse you.

Chapter 5 — The Escape

New street, new alphabet of corners. Your footsteps learned a different drum. You measured the rooms by how quickly they forgot other voices. You bought bowls and called it nesting. The kettle boiled in a language you were sure you could learn. At the market, you held fruit the way you wished to be held: gently, as if bruise were not a metaphor but a daily hazard.

You found work—enough to keep stillness from turning predatory. A coworker with wind-chapped hands taught you where to eat cheaply and where not to walk after midnight. You pretended to be this person: a newcomer with a legal name that matched their documents, a future planned in pencil, a mouth that could hold its own.

It is possible to begin again. It is also possible to drag the past across the border hidden in a spare battery and the phrases you choose during silence. The old hunger had not lost your address; it forwarded itself. The new face wore different cologne, told better jokes, promised without overpromising—skillful, as if repetition had made him efficient.

You hedged, then fell. You built conditions like fences and then held the gate open with your foot. The mirrored bathroom learned what your shoulders do when you’re choosing self-betrayal. You called it generosity. You said: this time I can hold my center. You watched yourself move the center six inches to make room for him. You called it compromise. The floor called it gravity.

Narcissism wears polish when it travels. Cruelty learns to smile with its teeth tucked away. You made a calendar of apologies and could not find two that matched in substance. Your intuition shook you by the lapels; you smoothed your collar and called yourself dramatic. The day you finally named it, you whispered as if speaking truth too loudly might ruin your hearing.

The mirror did an awful thing: it agreed with you. You went very still. You let the room hear it.

Chapter 6 — The Breakdown

There is a competence that hides collapse so well you can wear it to work. You wore it. You filed and fetched and answered politely. You took your lunch outside and watched the world debt-collect from other people. You cried in the bathroom and fixed your face with the tenderness of a nurse who is also a patient.

The apartment kept you alive in small ways: a window that faced enough sky to remind you the planet was not a ceiling; a tap that started singing if you forgot to turn it all the way off; a neighbor who left their radio on low so the hallway hummed like a mammal sleeping. You put your palm on the kitchen table and asked it to hold you. It did what it could.

You put the passport in sight like an icon. It promised nothing and you projected everything. The truth arrived unadorned: paper is not power. Transport is not absolution. The border you needed to cross ran behind your ribs. To go home you’d have to stop using distance as a shield and silence as a second language. You hated this truth and then you fed it soup.

You didn’t announce the decision. You didn’t even admit it when you bought the boxes. You told yourself you were only sorting. You became the kind of person who gives away a chair and keeps a key. You left the country the way you arrived: with a suitcase that made too much noise and a face that knew better than to ask the city to bless you.

On the last night, you slept three hours and dreamt of a white room with a single mirror. No doors this time. The room waited for you to put yourself back where you belonged. You woke already moving.

Chapter 7 — The Return

Nothing had changed. That was a gift. The streetlights made their familiar small halos. The station sold the same cheap coffee that tasted like resolve. The sky kept its weather secrets the way it always had. You exhaled something you didn’t know you’d been holding since the first day you learned how to leave.

You did not audition for your old life. You stepped into rooms as if they had been renting your outline. You washed the sheets twice. You opened a box marked “misc” and found versions of yourself that had waited without judgment: a scarf that still knew your neck, a book with a bus ticket as a spine, a photo where your smile had not yet learned to perform. You sat on the floor and allowed nostalgia without considering it a sin.

Routines returned at the pace of trust. Morning light on the same table, the same mug, the same teaspoon’s pretend ceremony. You began writing again, not as a performance for witnesses you didn’t respect, but as a signal to yourself that you were worth reading. You answered messages without overexplaining. You learned how to say no like a hinge. Click, steady. Click, steady.

You did not become invulnerable. You cried without apologizing. You let grief eat at your edges and then you fed yourself back. You grew friendships slow and without choreography. You allowed quiet people to be enough company. On certain afternoons, you sat near a window and let the world arrange its own beauty without you forcing it.

When shame came back—as it does—you offered it a chair instead of your throat. You asked it questions. It gave you weather reports, not orders. You walked to the corner shop and the woman at the till called you love and it landed like a key in a door you’d been leaning against. You went home lighter by nothing measurable.

The country hadn’t softened. You had.


---

Chapter 8 — The Reckoning

The mirror did not change shape to flatter you. You changed shape to stop needing it to. You learned the inventory of your face without verdicts: the kindness that only arrives when you are tired of fighting yourself, the hardness that saves your life twice a year, the weary intelligence that knows how to parse a promise from a sales pitch.

You stopped auditioning for belonging. You picked yourself for the role that never had a casting call. You forgave the versions of you that mistook starvation for romance and vigilance for love. You kept some of their talent—how to read a room, how to hear the part of a sentence that wasn’t spoken—and retired the rest.

This is not a phoenix story. There is no fire bright enough to justify the burning. This is a moss story: soft, stubborn, archaic, green even in shade. You covered your own ruins and called it living. You learned that tenderness is not a prize given for obedience but a muscle you exercise when no one is watching.

The passport sleeps in a drawer. Borders still exist; you simply no longer outsource your salvation to them. You travel lighter: less suitcase, more spine. You walk past mirrors and stop only when you want to admire how a person can look like themselves after all they’ve survived.

You write a note and tape it inside the cupboard door, where only you will read it while reaching for tea: I was never gone. I only forgot where to look. On bad days, it’s an instruction. On good days, it’s a hymn. Most days, it’s domestic—an ordinary sentence holding the ceiling up.

The phone still buzzes. Sometimes it’s him, or someone calibrated to his frequency. Gravity remembers your name. But your feet learned a new physics. You let the buzz pass like weather through a well-built room. You pour the water. You wait for the boil. You live.

At night, you close the door with no fear the world will disappear without you witnessing it. It isn’t a triumph. It’s a practice. The future is not taller. It’s wider. You step into it, not to prove, not to atone, but because this is what you were always made for: the long, patient art of returning to yourself, again and again, until there is nowhere else left to go.





📖 Chapter 9 — The Dreaming Mirror

Stories don’t appear from nowhere. They crawl out of dreams, half-lit, soaked in symbols the waking mind doesn’t understand until it’s too late. This one was no exception.

The dreams were always divided: high places where mountains touched the ice, and lowlands where everything burned or crumbled into dust. There was never an in-between. Either the body froze in thin air, or it sank into lifeless ground. That was the logic of sleep—the soul rehearsing survival in landscapes that refused balance.

In those nights, dead relatives returned as messengers. A father who never spoke, only drove. An aunt who offered comfort and then vanished. A grandfather who raged, his mind already lost in waking life and found again in nightmares. They were not ghosts. They were anchors. They appeared whenever the waking body drifted too far from itself, as if to remind: don’t forget where you came from, even if you can’t stay there.

The car came often too—unstable, swerving, driven by hands that didn’t feel like hands at all. Sometimes the dream turned cruel: deer’s hooves pressing the wheel, feet too clumsy for pedals. Driving without a license, without preparation, on roads that had no signs. It was absurd, but it was accurate. Because that was life outside the dream: steering with the wrong limbs, untrained, terrified, but moving forward anyway.

The hotel appeared most of all. A labyrinth of rooms that never belonged to you. Doors that led to libraries, hospitals, schools—never the room you paid for, never the one with your name on it. Always searching for a bed you could claim. Always denied. And wasn’t that the story itself? The long search for a room where the soul could rest, the endless refusal, the price that kept changing?

That is why this story arrived. Not for romance. Not for punishment. But to put order to the dreams. To say: this is not just a nightmare sequence, this is a map. The leaving, the drug, the collapse, the return—they were not accidents. They were rehearsals written in the subconscious long before the waking mind had words for them.

The story demanded to be told so that the dream could be understood. It whispered: write me, or I will keep circling you in sleep. Face me, or I will keep sending the dead to speak in your ear. Admit me, or I will keep putting you in cars with deer’s hooves and hotels with no room.

And so here it is: not a novel, not a confession, but a reckoning between dream and day. The reason is not simple. The reason is survival. To write is to declare: I was never lost. I was dreaming. And now I am awake enough to name the dream.?!",1,1757519911.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

now it got me too. I read already from another user that experienced the same.         
        
- What was supposed to he a three step calibration processes ended up in five steps, wasting plenty of beans.        
- The result was between 45 and 55ml of Espresso. Strongest setting, should have been 36ml. Result was accordingly bad. Yes, I tried different beans and freshly roasted ones, medium roast. Wasted a lot and a lot of beans.              
- Thus I got in contact with customer service.      
- They made me run all kind of tests and cleaning programs for an hour long phone call. I wasted even more beans.         
- Final result was that they offered a machine replacement. I had  to send it first back before receiving a new one. They chose UPS and I had to lugg the heavy machine there. Spend another 15-20 minutes trying to pack everything back into the box.       
- After a week and a half I received a replacement.       
- No sorry, no fresh beans included to make up for all the ones I wasted.           
- New attempt, first two shots were zeroing in on the right value (32g close to the target). Boom, next two shot 56g again. Trying next day again, whole process starts over again, ending up at 40-42g per shot, 15 seconds brew time. Still no 36g, still over extracted, shot comes sploshing and not like honey flowing. Of course not a pleasent shot. Manual adjustment doesn't help. Lots of more beans wasted in the process.      
- Contacting customer service again, asking them to take the machine back and refund me.        
- Yea, yea, we understand your disappointment, let me talk to the responsible person if we can refund you.       
- E-Mail received: No, we don't do refunds, we can only replace the machine again.        
         
Yea, guys, here is your reward. Never again Ninja, and I'll still try to return this garbage. This time via the trader I bought it from, which will just come back to you anyways and cause everyone f* ton of extra efforts.

1ndi46f,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1ndi46f/coworker_who_was_unprofessional_and_dirty/,Coworker who was unprofessional and dirty,"I had a coworker at my last job, “Larry” who I’ve posted about before. In addition to his vindictive and disrespectful actions toward me and my colleagues, he had some pretty awful personal habits too. It’s people like him who have helped me to stand up for myself, even when it’s hard to do, and not take crap off of anyone. I can look back and laugh at the gross stuff he did now. I’m just glad I’m in a new opportunity now. 

One day, Larry and I were driving to a job site. He rolls down the window and spits out a loogie. I think I was going fast enough to where it splattered the side of my car. I give him one of the worst stink-eyes ever but contained my words. He was lucky I didn’t throw him out in the middle of Toronto, and make him get a taxi the rest of the way! 

This guy is basically Shrek, with a messy workspace and a nasty habit of burping and farting out loud in his cube next to me. He would aggressively blow his nose, and I thought a train was going by outside. He didn’t wash his hands after doing this. It got so bad, my team lead and I decided to clean up his workspace ourselves. He had worn off the letters of his keyboard and I was afraid to touch his mouse. Being around Larry made my contamination OCD even worse. He would leave empty pop cans and big gulp cups on the desk and leave rings. There was a coffee stain on the carpet. We had to throw away his chair. 

He was mad the next day after the big clean-up, and sat in his cube and pouted like a little kid. He got a slap on the wrist and was told something to the effect that the office is a shared space and he needs to be more considerate of others and company property. 

One day I finally snapped back at him. As I was walking through the hallway, I heard his long, loud belch from his cube. I told him “excuse you!” to which he responded “uhh thanks.” I was so sick of dealing with this every day. 

I caught him picking his nose, and scratching his crotch on two different occasions. Again, I 
just repressed my disgust and did my best to avoid him or touch anything that he had touched. I admit, I felt kind of sorry for him at a certain level, because I don’t think he knew any better. This was before he went full-time and developed his little power trip over our team. 

Once his reign of terror was over (he was basically “encouraged to quit” we all breathed a sigh of relief. He had lied to management about me and my team lead, poisoned our team dynamics, snubbed us all when deadlines got tight, blaming everyone but himself, and finally grossed everybody out doing it all. I hope Larry is getting the counseling he needs. I can forgive his vindictive and manipulative actions, but it has made me a more skeptical and cautious employee, with a firm understanding that not everyone is your friend in the office. I feel better prepared to deal with difficult colleagues now, so at least I can thank Larry for that.

Vegan for about 7 years, vegetarian for almost 12, above all for the animals, and the climate. I work for an NGO that does climate policy work.

* **Extended Producer Responsibility**: brands should pay to recycle every bit of packaging they create.
* **Global Plastic Treaty**: countries can’t just ship waste abroad to dump on poorer nations.

I'm on 100mg SR once a day. I take it at 7am. These past days I've been fine, drinking my usual coffee in the morning and all until yesterday, day 6 after coming home from work. I had my first anxiety attack in months. At first I felt suddenly like my chest was tight, head was floating, a little bit like vertigo but not really. My blood felt like it just rushed out of me like adrenaline and I couldn't take deep breaths. I hated the feeling it was so bad that I took a xanax (which I have for emergencies and haven't needed until now). I took my blood pressure and it was a bit higher than normal. 

I ended up feeling better after the xanax and breathing exercises. 
I slept well (mainly bc I take Wellbutrin SR only in the morning). 
But this morning I felt the same reaction a couple hours after taking it (half cup of coffee), sweaty hands, feeling my heart pounding, agitated, head floaty feeling. I chugged water and tried the breathing exercises again. 

Is this normal? I know there are side effects to deal with but I'm wondering if maybe these are extreme and shouldn't continue? The blood pressure thing (or anything cardiovascular) worries me too. Although perhaps it had spiked because of the anxiety attack. 
I already deal with health anxiety and take buspirone. But damn, its been rough suddenly and ngl it makes me scared to continue.

We get it—choosing the right portable espresso maker can be tricky. You want something that fits your lifestyle, doesn’t break the bank, and most importantly, makes great coffee. So how does the OutIn Nano compare to the well-known Wacaco Pixapresso? Both are awesome machines, but they cater to slightly different needs. Let's break it down for your daily grind.

We've rated some key categories on a 5-star scale to make the comparison snap into focus.



|Feature|Wacaco Pixapresso|OutIn Nano|The Takeaway|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Portability (Size/Weight)|★★★★☆|★★★★★|The Nano is lighter (670g vs. 755g) and has a slimmer profile. It wins for slipping into a tight backpack pocket.|
|Ease of Use|★★★☆☆|★★★★★|Pixapresso has a cool touchscreen for control. The Nano uses a simple 1-button operation (double-click/go). Pure simplicity.|
|Battery Life|★★★★★|★★★★☆|Pixapresso (3x3000mAh) has a slight edge on capacity, but both will get you through a day of shots on a charge.|
|Waterproofing|☆☆☆☆☆|★★★★☆|This is a big one. The Nano's IPX4 rating means peace of mind at the beach, lake, or in a rainy camp. The Pixapresso has no rating.|
|Brew Flexibility|★★★★★|★★★☆☆|The Pixapresso leads here with programmable temps, pre-infusion, and drink styles. The Nano is strictly about a great, simple espresso.|
|Cost|★★★★☆|★★★★★|For $10 less, the Nano offers a robust, waterproof, and dead-simple machine with fantastic portability.|
|***TTL***|21★|26★|The OutIn Nano wins on portability, waterproofing, and effortless operation, making it the ultimate grab-and-go espresso maker.|

The Verdict:

* Choose the Pixapresso if you're a tinkerer who loves to tweak pre-infusion and temperature for the perfect, customized shot. It's a fantastic portable lab.
* Choose the OutIn Nano if you value minimalist design, ultimate simplicity, and durability. Its waterproofing and one-button operation make it the true ""grab-and-go"" champion for adventures.

It feels like a thing so I can finally sleep and do my favorite part of the day again, coffee, nic, and the gym. 

I feel amazing when im working out and listening to my favorite bands, but that takes like 1 hour every other day, I feel amazing when I am playing games with friends, but that sucks cuz I dont wanna rely on people and we dont play as much anyways.

I tried many hobbies but never a one that I could actually love, I tried learning the piano, drawing, cycling (which was fun, but the weather is horribly hot for 80% of the year all day and night), swimming, developing games, volunteering, you name it. I would say one reason is I never got into them because I never got the chance to be good and comfortable with them. But it is hard to do so when it feels like a chore rather than being genuinely interested in them.

I would like introvert hobbies since there isnt much socializing you could do out here unless you already have friends which I lack, I never enjoyed making friendships as much as I would love to have a friend, everytime someone asks me to hangout I say yes but im always like ugh I wanna get back home.

Themes of deja vu, Death, and life.


To give you a back story, I have had dreams about people I hadn't thought about in years. This has happened about 4 times now, and within the next month or so they end up passing away. My dream never has showed them being dead, but it's almost like I feel called to reach out but don't remember their names to find them again to check in with them.

When I was younger in my early 10s and teens, I had a lot of déja vu like dreams, one very particular one I remember is my mom and l in the kitchen, making a dessert in our PJs. A couple of weeks later it came through into the physical realm. This stopped happening for a while, and then I started having them again when I started my first ""big girl"" job a few years ago today. I was getting dreams about the future and when I was in that moment, it felt like I had seen it or been in it before. And it would hit me really hard. I would notice this feeling and feel like I'm on the right track. 

Last week, I met the most amazing man. We went on a date Friday, and I spent the night with him (we didn't hook up) since I came in from out of town. 

The next morning, we were discussing what we were wanting out of relationships. He was speaking and I was listening intently. I have had dreams in the past, but nothing this jolting, so in the moment. I was not dreaming now, in fact this vision happened right in front of me, it's like I dissociated from reality to have this happen. It was terrifying and beautiful all at the same time.

It was him.

He was the one standing at the end of the aisle, him holding my hand as I was in labor, and him on a big cream couch comforting me, as I processed the loss of my dad. I was watching myself in the third person, but it was me. I felt the presence of my god father with me as I walked down the aisle - I remember a big cathedral with light shining down on him (the guy), and then this moment of electricity hit my chest. I haven't been able to shake this electric feeling, and it doesn't feel like anxiety at all, more like sunshine.

I came back to earth, and sipped on the coffee he had so graciously made for me that morning- I just immediately felt comfort with him, I have no other way to explain it. I sat in my car for 20 minutes after he said goodbye, and fully all took it in. It was and still is outer worldy.
I still am feeling this feeling of sunshine in my chest. In my 26.8 years of life, I have never, ever had this feeling encapsulate me so hard. Even after multiple long term relationships. I am not reaching out to him, because I have to think he feit the same way, from the words and intention he showed me on our time together. It was so pure, and so right. Our stories aligned to a tee. It was like I was looking at a mirror of myself, in all the good, and the bad. The way he held me, forehead kisses, laughter, and made sure I was okay, it was like everything had aligned.

I don't want to chase him, I want him to come to me when he is ready. He is a true gentleman, and everything I have been praying for, for years. The scariest part is that I trusted every word that came out of his mouth, and I use a lot of discernment when l meet people (and don't trust right away). I have been thinking about him nonstop since our meeting. The way he opened up to me and how genuinely right it was. We haven't been in contact much this week, and I am scared. I am scared I am going to miss out on my soul mate and my forever person, someone who in my vision was comforting me through the death of my father, and took care of me until our physical bodies left this world.

I walked away in 100% certainty that he was into me. All the advice on the internet around dating says ""if he could he would"" or ""if he's not texting you he's just not that interested in you"" but I didn't get this feeling at all, which is completely out of pocket for me.

If you think I am crazy, please don't respond to this post - I have no current or history of mental illness. I am genuinely looking for spiritual and soulful guidance on this situations, visions, and what I should do next. The dreams are one thing, but having a full blown vision is another. I am ready to accept I have this gift, but I dont know the next steps to truly step into the power of it.

How do I go about my deep intuition? How do I handle this very special gift? I have been trying to find a coach or guide for a long time, but that experience Saturday very much solidified needing guidance.

I’m looking for an ACL bestie who has an extra 3-day wristband (Weekend 1 or 2) and wants to team up for the weekend. I’ve got the space and the local perks to make it fun and stress-free:
	•	🏡 Stay in my 1920s Craftsman bungalow: Off South Congress, just 2 miles from Zilker. Small but full of character. You’ll have the couch or an air mattress with a memory foam topper + fluffy pillows — way more luxe than it sounds.
	•	❄️ Amenities: AC at 70, WiFi, laundry handled. We’ll be sharing a bathroom (it’s a 1920s house, part of the charm).
	•	🔥 Perks at the house: Fire pit, cold plunge, and a large patio for relaxing before/after fest days.
	•	🎉 SoHo House access: I’m a member and can bring you along to ACL-weekend parties (great vibes + some celeb spotting).
	•	🌮 Food covered: Breakfast tacos are on me (7-min walk to the best in town). I’ll stock the house with snacks and can pack meals if wanted.

He's retired, but stayed on part time after retirement. I do UT, and he does... ""simpler"" forms of welding - some MT, but otherwise mostly plug welds. Something that has to look nice when you cap it off... but other than that, hasn't done a deep-tested weld all his life.

>^(Anyways, for the whole year, I've been listening to his horseshit every time I go on a coffee break - how hard he has it, why he always gets the tough job, how ""this"" guy has it easy, how ""that"" job barely breaks a sweat.)

>^(My turn came several times - he said UT is child's play, that anyone could do it, that SG-700 is for school kids who are learning welding. Even then, I flipped him off politely by saying that he sounds tired, he should maybe take a break from the ""hard"" stuff and join me for a month or two to rest up a bit. I could arrange it with the boss because we're short on UT. His eyes turned wide, his face pale, he said it's not necessary and that he'll manage... ""somehow"".)

>^(Not taking the hint, he continued on his ""\*mine is the only work on this company that doesn't suck\*"" rhetoric, until one day, that day being TODAY, an opportunity presented itself. Our supply guy was taking a dump and I urgently needed a grinding disk, so I went to a buddy of mine that was assigned to ""him"" (poor guy) to see if I can borrow one of his.)

>^(As I approached him, I proceeded to notice him staring at a weld where a part of it looked like someone crapped on it. After asking him for a disk, I asked him what's going on, he said that ""he"" (the old guy made this weld and now he's got to grind it down before merging his own weld with ""his"". So I asked him. "")\*You mean them' sausages over there?\*"")

>^(What I didn't know is that the old guy was behind the cover, welding and eavesdropping. As soon as he heard the word ""sausages"", he stopped the weld, threw his mask off, and jumped toward me, red from rage as a cooked crab. He yammered on some incoherent babble about me sticking my nose in other people's business and to stay away from his work.)

>^(Then I said the sentence that instantly deflated him:)  
^(""\*Who the fuck do you think you are to be insulted by criticism after you trash talked every department in this company except yours for the entire year?\*"")

>^(He didn't say a damned thing anymore. He just walked away. Didn't even pack up his shit, hasn't turned off his welder or the gas feed. Changed his clothes and went home, left everything where he dropped it. We barely started work an hour earlier.)

To be clear, I don't claim any moral high ground here. I shut down an asshole by acting as an even bigger asshole. Such is shop life, if you don't put down a douche bag, he's only gonna keep doing it... or worse, escalate!

Please if you're (the person I met) reading this, don't take it personally! I have no friends so I'm letting it out here!

So I posted in a city sub about meeting someone a week or two ago and got a DM from a girl! She was 3 years older than me, relatively more mature (in her own words) and slightly more settled in life! 

I was a bit hesitant at first, but we moved from reddit to telegram/WhatsApp and for the past week had very deep conversations (was mostly me ranting TBH and a bit from her side as well) and calls sometimes reached almost to 6 hours!

I was thinking of her in some romantic sense in the beginning, but later mutually decided that we should just be friends! If I look back, it was me who lashed out and demand clarity from her and she just wanted to be friends! I accepted it, since I currently don't even have that luxury!

We finally decided to meet today! I don't have a car at the moment and its pouring heavy, so for me it was either risk getting soaking wet or book a cab for a 50km round trip! I booked a cab!

The moment I met her! Her face was BLANK! Absolutely emotionless! She told me that she kinda has an emotionless face, but I thought she'll feel a bit easy once we start talking. Never Happened! It was like a switch turned on and she shut down the emotions we had on call! It's not like we didn't see each other before! The very first thing I did was share some of my photos, like back from an year when I looked okayish! Right now there isn't any change as such but I've shaved my head and have a very scruffy beard!

Anyways, I've been on friendly get togethers but this was soooo COLD! there wasn't even a friendly handshake! We just went to the food courtyard and I waddled behind her anxiously while she selected food! I realized I was getting a bit feverish mid way so I let her finish the food while I sipped coffee and ate just a tiny bit! 

I tried my best to hold a conversation! I was too conscious and nervous! Not because It was nerve wreaking meeting her, but I'm someone who ""looks"" a bit above average, but right now I have a shaved head and a very unkempt beard! So I was just hoping no one recognizes me from my hometown and I was comically vigilant!

I kept trying to get her interested but I knew the meeting had BOMBED! But I felt betrayed! Throughout our calls, I reminded her repeatedly that I've been judged my whole life on my looks because my brother's a model/actor and it was only recently in my life that my genes hit and I started looking a bit good and a lot less fugly! 

While talking, I simply nudged her that, if I don't get any cues, just say it straight to my face! And she did! She said she wanted to be left alone!

I exited the mall! Puked on the sidewalk! Booked a cab and went back home! Had a chat with her on what happened and she still doesn't have the honesty to tell me what went wrong! 

She's insistent on it being my mental state and that she was only entertaining me because she felt bad! Continously sending me help guides on mental health!

I am not able to wish ill will on her, as my brain just refuses to blame anyone but myself!

This was the first time I had opened myself and become vulnerable with someone only with the incentive of getting a friend who GETS me!
After repeated disclaimers that she wouldn't judge me by my current state, she did!

I'm very sad! My whole Outlook is shattered! I was of the thought that if I'd learn to be vulnerable, I'll grow! And maybe my unlucky streak with women would end as I had a very reserved emotional behaviour previously!

I botched what could've been a good friendship! She kept reminding me that we're verryy different! My brain refused to register as I was fixated on those long calls and was expecting the same!

I know I trauma dumped on her! But I didn't deserve getting pulled 40 km in pouring rain across the city just to get whatever it was! TBH! If she would've explained that to my face! I would've been relieved! Guess I didn't even deserve that!

I'm completely numb! Only reason I can think of my weird behavior is that I've never been the one approaching as all my previous girlfriends made the first move! This was sort of a first move from me and I got burned badd!

I didn't wanna meet her like at all! I was so happy with just those calls. It was her who pushed me saying she couldn't sustain this kind of friendship and would prefer meeting a lot more!

I don't want any suggestions really but I'll take kindness if it comes this way! Thanks!",0,1757518764.0,AskIndia,10,0.5,False

1ndhm2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ndhm2u/philippines_the_theater_of_justice_where_the/,Philippines: The Theater of Justice Where the Guilty Wear Suits,"
In a country where the sun rises over rice fields and the laughter of elders once echoed through humble homes, a quiet tragedy unfolds one that is not written in history books, but etched into the aching hearts of the Filipino people. It is the tragedy of injustice, of stolen dignity, of a nation betrayed by those sworn to protect it.

I did not expect my heart to shatter today. I was simply scrolling through TikTok, seeking distraction, perhaps a moment of levity. But instead, my feed became a mirror to a reality I could no longer ignore. Video after video showed elderly Filipinos wrinkled hands, bent backs, tired eyes still working, still struggling, still surviving. They should be resting, telling stories to grandchildren, sipping coffee in peace. But instead, they are selling vegetables under the scorching sun, sweeping streets for coins, enduring pain for a few pesos. And my empath heart, cursed and blessed, could not look away.

What broke me wasn’t just their suffering. It was the unbearable contrast. While these elders toil for survival, corrupt politicians, engineers, and contractors sit in air-conditioned offices, sipping imported wine bought with stolen public funds. Their children flaunt designer bags and jet-set across continents, their smiles paid for by the sweat of the poor. Lavish homes, luxury cars, foreign education all funded by money that was never theirs to begin with. The audacity is suffocating.

And yet, the system protects them. We watch televised hearings, see headlines about billions lost to corruption, and hear promises of accountability. But at the end of the day, no one is jailed. No one pays. No one weeps for the nation they’ve robbed.

Worse, some of the very senators who sit at the helm of these investigations grilling witnesses, demanding answers have themselves been convicted of crimes. They speak of justice while wearing the mask of innocence, their own hands stained by plunder and betrayal. It is a theater of hypocrisy, where the actors pretend to be heroes while the real victims our elders, our workers, our children are left behind the curtain, unseen and unheard.

Meanwhile, an old man who stole a single can of sardines because he was hungry, because he had no choice is thrown behind bars. His crime was poverty. His punishment was humiliation.

This is not just unfair. It is grotesque.

The Philippines bleeds quietly. Floodwaters rise in provinces where infrastructure funds were embezzled. And with the floods come disease leptospirosis, a silent killer that creeps into homes through contaminated water. People die not just from illness, but from neglect. From betrayal. From the billions that were meant for flood control but vanished into the pockets of officials. As of now, the hearings focus only on the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), where billions of pesos were mishandled. But what about the other departments? What about the Bureau of Customs, where smuggled goods and bribery rot the system from within? What about the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health, the Department of Education each one a chapter in the same tragic book?

Where are the hearings for them? Where is the outrage?

Children walk barefoot through flooded streets. Families sleep beside drainage canals. The poor die quietly, while the powerful live loudly. And still, the corrupt smile. They wave to cameras. They run for office again. They pretend not to know where the money went.

But we know. We see. We feel.

And for those of us with hearts that break too easily, this is a heavy burden. To feel everything. To mourn strangers. To rage at injustice. To cry for a country that deserves so much more.

I do not know what comes next. I am scared of what this realization will demand of me. But I know this: empathy is not weakness. It is a fire. And maybe, just maybe, it will be the spark that burns down the walls of corruption and builds something kinder in its place.

Until then, I will keep feeling. I will keep speaking. I will keep remembering the old man and his sardines. The child who died of leptospirosis. The mother who lost her home to floodwaters. Because their stories matter. Because they matter.

1ndhm21,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ndhm21/i_took_a_free_mirror_from_branford_ave_its_trying/,I took a free mirror from Branford Ave. It's trying to trade places with me.,"*Part 1*

The mirror had a paper sign taped to it: **FREE**

It leaned against a brownstone stoop on Branford Ave, between a shuttered deli and a barber with a spinning red pole. The glass was tall enough to show me from head to toe, set in a carved wooden frame that had probably been expensive when the world was quieter. I told myself I was rescuing it. Truth is, I wanted a win. My apartment looks bigger when you can see yourself inside it. It's pretty empty so far; all I really have is a bed, TV, and the usual, but nothing fancy like this mirror.

""You taking that?"" The barber called from his doorway, flicking ash.

""If it's free,"" I said.

""Nothing's free,"" he said, and went back inside. It sounded like advice masquerading as small talk. He stuck his head out again. ""Wasn't here when I opened,"" he added. ""Stuff just shows up. It's a city.""

I checked for cracks. None. The frame felt warm, not sun-warm, but hand-warm, as if someone had just lifted their palm away. I peeled the sign loose so it wouldn't flap while I carried it. The free looked like block letters, only neater. I hauled the mirror home awkwardly, the scrollwork biting into my forearms, and propped it in the hallway across from my kitchen doorway. Right away, it made the place look taller. It made me look... put together.

The first night, I noticed a lag. Not a big one. I lifted my hand; the reflection-me, obviously, was a hair late. I told myself I was tired. Fluorescents hum, hands shake, brains invent.

I stood there longer than I meant to, watching the dim hallway behind me repeat itself. The mirror's version of my apartment looked the same, except the ceiling stain above the smoke alarm wasn't there. A tiny difference. Or I just hadn't noticed mine before.

I tried to catch the lag again-quick, stupid gestures. If anyone had looked through my peephole, they would've seen a guy shadow-boxing his own face. Nothing. Perfect sync.

I turned away, and the reflection didn't. I felt it more than saw it. a weight behind my shoulder blades, the air turned thick as old syrup. I looked back. The me in the mirror smiled tightly, embarrassed. The smile I do in photos when I hate myself for being in them.

""Stop,"" I said to nobody.

In the mirror, I watched my mouth shape the word a fraction late. I didn't hear anything-just the fluorescent hum shifting key, like it wanted to listen.

I let the hallway light burn and went to bed. The stove clock blinked 3:13 a.m. like it had lost power. I hadn't unplugged anything.

Around 2 a.m., something woke me. Not a noise, an idea landing in my skull with both feet. I got up and walked to the doorway barefoot. The mirror reflected the hallway, the cracked dish on the entry table, and me. It also reflected the window by the sink.

The window in the reflection had its blinds up. Mine were down.

I lifted my blinds. The reflection lowered theirs.

I stood there with my hands on my own cheap vinyl slats, heart pounding, and whispered, ""Stop.""

In the mirror, I nodded.

I didn't.

I went back to bed and left the blinds up. The reflection left theirs down.

I woke with a thin line of dried blood on my cheek like a cat had sized me up in the night. I don't have a cat. The line on the other side, where my face met the glass, looked clean and surgical. The one on me wasn't.

*END OF PART 1*

*PART 2*

I covered the glass with an old blanket before work, an impulse move like throwing a towel over a birdcage. I told myself it was to keep the dust off. When I got home, the blanket was on the floor, folded into a decent square.

I live alone.

It was a bad week—double shifts and bad coffee and that feeling like your skin's a half-size too small. I started catching the mirror with its timing off, not lagging, but out of phase. As I walked past, I'd see myself already turning. I stopped eating in the kitchen because I kept catching my reflection watching me chew with its tongue pushed against the side of its mouth like a dog tasting a new word.

On Thursday, I boiled pasta. Steam fogged the hallway, and the mirror found itself a bathroom. Letters drew themselves into the condensation with slow, patient strokes.

**BORROWED.**

The letters fattened with condensation like veins. When I wiped them, my forearm burned—mirror-backward **D E W O R R O B** welted there like a stamp someone pressed too hard.

I couldn't pretend after that. Whatever happened **there** happened **here.**

I started testing. Stupid small stuff. I raised my left hand. The reflection raised their too, no camera-app nonsense. I leaned in until my breath ghosted the glass. The me on the other side leaned in, eyes wide, a brown freckle I know by heart under the right one. I lifted my shirt to check the small surgical scar on my ribs. It was there. It was me. That was the worst part. It wasn't a stranger. It was I who was wrong.

I went to the hardware store on Fulton and bought painter's tape and a roll of coarse twine. Back home, I taped a grid over the glass, stringing the twine so the surface was a spiderweb of little squares. If anything in there went out of bounds, I'd see it.

That night, around 3 a.m., a square near the bottom left darkened like breath on winter glass. A fingertip pressed up from the other side, testing the give. Another finger. They traced the string, learned the pattern, and then... slowly, so slowly, dragged downward.

Each time the fingertip slid along the twine, the string sang, a small mouse-squeak. I felt in my teeth. The black line it left inside the glass looked wet. My shin answered with a sting mirror couldn't possibly know,

I looked down and watched a thin line appear in my skin, a shallow, smarting cut blooming dot by dot like a Polaroid of pain.

I yelled, ""FUCK! OW!"" The sound hurt my ears more than the cut. I grabbed the dish towel from the entry table, pressed it to my leg, and stared as the fingertip in the mirror wrote one more word in the fogged square.

**KEEP.**

I slept with the lights on, perched on the edge of the couch. I wore socks so nothing could touch my ankles.

I woke up barefoot.

*END OF PART 2*

*PART 3*

Friday, I told myself to be normal. I texted Nora (co-worker) to swing by under the pretense of ""I finally decorated."" She came with iced coffees and a mercy candle that smelled like laundry.

""Be honest,"" Nora said, setting the iced coffee on my entry dish. ""This is a haunted Goodwill score.""

""It's fine,"" I lied. ""It just... lags.""

""Like a Zoom call?""

""Like a person.""

She snorted, then stopped. ""Okay, I hate that you said that.""

We moved it. The frame bit my palms. ""Careful,"" she said. ""Don't crack your face in it. Seven years of selfies.""

We shuffled it opposite the bathroom door. The twine grid quivered. I kept my eyes down because looking into it while I held it felt like giving someone your throat.

""Better,"" Nora said. ""Less... first thing you see.""

The water shut off in the bathroom. I stood catching my breath. In the mirror, across the hall, the bathroom door was closed. Mine was open.

""Nora,"" I said.

""What?""

In the glass, she stepped out of the bathroom and didn't look at me. She looked at the edge of the frame and smiled like she'd found a window that only opened one way. Then she raised her hand, palm toward the glass, like she wanted a high five.

""You okay?"" real Nora asked beside me. ""You look like hot pennies smell.""

""Do you see—"" I started.

""See what?""

""Nothing,"" I said, and made rules that night. Not written (I'd learned my lesson). I said them out loud; **Do not look with the lights off. Do not adjust the blinds. Do not touch the glass. Do not acknowledge it.**

The mirror doesn't care about my rules.

At 3:13 a.m., time stamped in my head like a burned-in watermark—I woke to knocking. Not at my door. From the hallway. Two careful knuckles on glass. Cold slid over the hallway like a refrigerator door opening. The twine squeaked softly after each knock, like a string being tuned. I stared at the seiling and pretended I could ignore it. The fourth knock came lower, like knuckles searching for where I was.

I got up because people get up. I stood in the doorway and looked. In the mirror, I was already there, two steps closer than me, eyes a little too wide like someone had told a decent joke, and I was waiting to see if I was allowed to laugh.

I raised my hand like an idiot about to touch a hot stove.

The other me mouthed a word.

**PLEASE**

I went and got a painter's drop cloth from under the sink nd threw it over the mirror like drowning something in a pillowcase.

The knocking kept going under the cloth until it didn't. On the fourth knock, something tapped from **my** side of the cloth.

*END OF PART 3*

*PART 4*

Saturday morning, I tried to take it back. I couldn't take it anymore.

I carried the mirror down the four flights in my socks because shoes felt disrespectful, and left bloody half-moons on the stairs where the frame bit my hands. Out of Branford, I set it where I'd found it, under the barber pole, the city coming alive around us. I put the old FREE sign on it and added SORRY.

A woman with a stroller slowed down. I stepped between her and the glass without thinking. ""It's cracked,"" I said. ""Bad luck."" I made my face friendly and a little deranged. She moved on.

I waited. One hour, then two. The barber came out to smoke and told me he didn't mind, but did I want to tape the sign to the pole so it didn't blow and decapitate a bus. He tore a square of yellow paper from a pad. ""City gets fussy about sidewalk stuff. Leave a number in case someone complains."" I wrote mine and stuck it under the FREE sign. I asked him if he'd ever seen it here before. He shook his head no, then yes, then no. ""Stuff just shows up,"" he said. ""It's a city.""

Around noon, a guy in a moving truck pulled up and stuck his head out. ""We just bought a place in Briar's End,"" he said. ""My wife loves vintage.""

""Tell her congratulations,"" I said, and didn't move.

He laughed, then didn't. ""You ever get that feeling like an empty room is looking at you? I just git that feeling.""

""The mirror's—"" I started.

He glanced at the glass. The surface didn't shine; it **noticed.** It felt like the air took a breath and held it until my eyes watered.

""You know what?"" he said, shivering like a dog shaking off river water. ""My wife will kill me. Good luck, man""

He drove away. I carried the mirror back up because some debts are personal.

Back in the hall, I taped the twine again and sat on the floor with my back to the opposite wall. I didn't look directly in. Periphery only. The other me paced in there like a caged thing. We mirrored each other badly.

""Okay,"" I said finally. ""Take back what?""

He mouthed something and stopped. He looked at his right wrist, turned it so I could see. There was a bracelet there in his world. Woven thread, blue and white, and sun-bleached yellow. I owned that bracelet once, in 7th grade, at camp on Macon Lake. I lost it in the water. It never dried. 

He tugged the bracelet off and pressed it to the glass. It left a wet circle, like the glass was on the other side of rain.

My forearm went cold. When I lifted my sleeve, the bracelet was there, damp against my skin, knots swollen like they'd lived underwater.

I ripped it off and threw it. It slapped the hallway floor and lay there steaming.

He smiled. Not the photo-smile. Something relieved and hungry. He pressed his hand to the glass again. I knew what he wanted to trade next. He wanted to trade places with me..

""Stop,"" I said. ""If I give you...If I give you **ME**, what happens when it's skin instead of string?""

He shrugged a little, a movement I've hated in mirrors my whole life. He mouthed a new word.

**SOON.**

My phone screen lit up by itself. New contact added: Me. The number was mine. The photo wasn't.

**Recent calls:**

**3:13 AM - Me (missed)**

**3:13 AM - Me (missed)**

That night, I dreamed I was on the wrong side, banging. I woke up with my knuckles bruised and the twine grid damp with breath that wasn't mine. 

*END OF PART 4*

*PART 5*

I called in sick on Sunday because I wasn't. I made tea because that's what you do when you don't know what to do. I set the mug beside the entry dish and sat opposite the mirror again, the way you sit opposite a friend you don't trust and a stranger you do.

""Show me,"" I said.

He did. He backed up, staying carefully inside the frame, until I could see more of his hallway. No ceiling stain. Same cheap light fixture. The entry table in there had a different dish—a blue ceramic instead of my cracked glass. The door to the bathroom was shut. He made a pointing gesture at it, two fingers, come see.

I didn't move. He opened the bathroom door on his side, and the mirror showed a reflection of a room with no mirror over the sink, just a blank wall. He mouthed another word, not one I've ever liked.

**ALONE.**

I don't know why I did what I did next. I wanted to prove something, maybe, to him or me or the rules. I reached into my pocket and took out my house key. I pressed the tip of it to the glass, hard enough to make the twine squeak.

On his side, a silver point met my keyhead perfectly. He'd brought his too.

""If we're the same,"" I said, pressing metal to cold, ""prove it hurts you too.""

He did.

We pressed. Metal on metal, the sound is small and disgusting. The keys scraped along the surface and left a thin white line that wasn't on my side. It was on him. His cheek, the same place as that first dried blood line on mine.

He flinched.

I didn't

""Hurts, doesn't it?"" I said, full of a petty heat even I hated.

He smiled, wide and wrong, teeth I knew too well. He pressed his key to the glass again—harder. I saw where he was siming a split second before the pain hit. Not my cheek this time.

I made a sound I won't write down. Use your imagination.

I fell sideways. Tea flooded the floor. The twine grid trembled. The strings hummed a thin note I felt in the fillings of my teeth. On the other side, he watched me curl around myself, and he touched the glass with his fingertips like a child touching a TV screen.

He mouthed a last word I understood all too well, forward or backward.

**MINE.**

I crawled, gasping, and threw the drop cloth over the mirror. I nailed it in place this time, the cheap way—tacks into plaster—the sound of hammer on wall wild and small. Each hit made the glass answer with a soft, bell-jar thrum, the way a big insect does against a lampshade.

The closet has shelves. I emptied it. I dragged the mirror inside, cloth and all, and wedged it between the winter coats and the box of cables that fit nothing I own. I shut the door.. I pushed the dresser in front of the door, I sat on the floor with my back to it, and listened.

Something in there breathed like a person who can't calm down and won't

It stopped around dawn.

It was Monday. I sat at my kitchen table with the blinds up and the window, pretending to be neutral. I kept thinking I saw my reflection in the dark screen of the microwave, moving in a way I didn't like. 

I called the barber to ask if anyone had picked up a mirror yesterday, just to make sure I hadn;t hallucinated moving it back. He said the weirdest thing. He said he watched me put it out there and then watched me carry it away again. He said, ""I felt bad for you. You looked like you lost the fight.""

I found a note under the closet door that I didn't put there. Cash-register paper, a little curled, smelling like the barber's shop

One word, in backward steam-script: **DUE**.

*END OF PART 5*

*PART 6*

The note said DUE, so I paid what I could: time.

I set an alarm for 3:12 a.m., lay on the floor by the dresser, and watched the minute flip. When it did, the closet breathed in

""No trades,"" I said. ""No more bracelets. Keep what you took. Leave what's mine.""

I don't think it understood the words. I think it understood the **want.** 

The tacks holding the cloth ticked in their holes like cooling metal. Something traced the twine grid through the blanket, learning the squares by memory. It tapped two knuckles—once, twice—then stopped and tapped a third one, lower, where my head had rested last night.

""I hear you,"" I said. ""That's all you get.""

A slow line burned across my palm, mirror-backward letters arriving out of order like receipts from a bad printer. **E M. A N. Y M.** I pressed my hand to the floor until the boards printed themselves in skin.

""Name,"" it was trying to write. It wanted my **name** in its spelling.

I didn't give it. I gave it something worse.

""Keep the cut,"" I said. ""Keep the bruise. Keep the time.""

Everything went very quiet. Then the cloth ballooned once, like a breath held as long as lungs allowed, and fell.

At 7:02 a.m., I woke on the kitchen floor. The ceiling stain was gone. The laundry candle smelled like static. My entry dish was whole.

I checked the closet. The dresser slid easily. The door opened without a complaint. The mirror—cloth and all—was gone.

At 7:05 a.m., the barber texted me from a number I didn't have saved: *Someone left a mirror out here. Says FREE. You want it back?* I typed **No.** I typed **Do not touch it.** I typed **Don't let it see you.** I deleted all of it and sent **Thanks.**

At 7:13 a.m., my phone rang. The contact said **Me.** The photo was of me, smiling a little too widely beside a blue ceramic dish I don't own. I felt it ring until it stopped.

It rang again at 3:13 a.m.

An In-Depth Review,"Testing the Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 Rice Cooker and Warmer along with the Zojirushi Micom Water Boiler has truly transformed my kitchen experience. These aren’t just appliances; they’re like those dependable friends who step up every time you need them. My time with them has been filled with hearty meals, perfectly brewed teas, and a newfound ease in the daily hustle of cooking. Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 and its sibling product deliver a blend of technology and convenience I didn’t think I needed until I experienced it firsthand.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing you notice about these Zojirushi items is their sleek, ergonomic design. The rice cooker, with its clean white finish and compact build, fits seamlessly on any countertop. The spherical nonstick inner pan doesn’t just look cool—it promises uniform heating, and I can confirm that it delivers on this. The extendable power cord is an underrated feature; no tangled wires to deal with? Yes, please!

On the other hand, the water boiler stands out with its Panorama Window design, allowing me to monitor water levels easily without even lifting the lid. The swivel base—oh, how did I manage without this before? Whether you’re grabbing water for green tea or an instant coffee break, convenience is maximized. Both products exude a sturdy build that promises durability, and I’m not worried about replacing them anytime soon.

**User Experience and Functionality**

After spending countless mornings and evenings using these appliances, one word comes to mind: effortless. The rice cooker’s intuitive controls made cooking everything from sushi rice to porridge foolproof. That Neuro Fuzzy logic? Total game-changer. It automatically adjusts time and temperature based on what you’re cooking. Even when I added slightly more water than needed, it adapted and served perfect rice. No mushy messes, no undercooked disasters.

As for the water boiler—four temperature settings? Yes, my tea routine just became a science experiment, in the best way possible. Perfectly heated water for every tea variety, from green to herbal, or even that experimental artisan blend I picked up last week. The quick-temp mode comes clutch when you’re impatient for that hot drink but don’t need a full boil.

**Highlights**

- The rice cooker easily handles everything from white rice to brown rice and even mixed dishes without sacrificing flavor or texture.  
- The water boiler’s energy-saving timer function (ranging from 6 to 10 hours) ensures you have hot water ready when you need it.  
- Both appliances boast easy-to-clean, nonstick interiors. No elbow grease needed.  
- The retractable power cords on both products keep my countertops free from clutter.

[Check Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 price on Amazon.](https://kitchenexplorers.com/p/b0bdw1vsgg/)

**Downsides to Consider**

Of course, no product is perfect, and I’d be remiss not to mention a few things. Let’s get into it:

- The rice cooker’s capacity might feel a bit limited if you’re hosting a larger group or have a big family. It holds 5.5 cups uncooked, which is fine for my family of four but might leave others wanting.  
- While the water boiler performs excellently, it doesn’t come with an automatic descale reminder. You’ll need to keep track or risk compromising its performance.  
- Both appliances are corded, so portability is somewhat limited—ideal for kitchens but less so for other environments.  

**Product Contenders**

In comparing these Zojirushi products to others on the market, I’ve noticed some key differences. Let’s start with rice cookers. Many competitors, like the Aroma Housewares model, might seem appealing due to their lower price, but they don’t deliver the same even cooking and nuanced temperature control. Cheaper models often result in uneven rice texture, a problem I never faced with Zojirushi’s Neuro Fuzzy Logic.

As for water boilers, while brands like Panasonic offer similar features, the Zojirushi edges ahead with its quick-temp functionality and energy-saving modes. It’s those little extras that really set it apart from peers in the same category.

**Bang for the Buck**

When it comes to price performance, you’re paying for a premium product—and you do get premium results. Cheaper alternatives are plentiful, but they tend to lack the long-term reliability and multi-functionality of Zojirushi’s offerings. These models don’t feel like disposable purchases but rather long-term investments in your kitchen arsenal. For anyone who puts a high value on ease of use, reliability, and consistent, high-quality results, it’s hard to argue that these aren’t worth every penny.

1ndhik7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeStressTest/comments/1ndhik7/reveal_how_the_huanuo_tv_tray_transforms_couch/,Reveal How the HUANUO TV Tray Transforms Couch Dining Comfort,"Testing out the HUANUO HNTTK2-B for the past weeks has been an unexpectedly delightful experience. This adjustable TV tray set of two surprised me with its versatility. I'm someone who enjoys working while lounging on the couch or having snacks during a late-night binge session, so I was curious to see if these trays would meet my expectations. Let me spill the beans: these little tables have been pulling their weight in my home ever since I set them up.

**Modern and Functional Design**

The sleek modern design and black powder-coated finish immediately caught my eye as I took the TV trays out of the box. It's simple but blends well with any interior, from minimalist setups to cozy, colorful rooms. The trays are crafted from alloy steel and plastic, which keeps them lightweight while maintaining durability. I appreciated the folding base—it makes tucking them away when not in use a breeze. However, I did notice that the plastic tabletop, though sturdy, isn't stain-resistant, making it necessary to be conscious of potential spills.

**Height and Angle Adjustability**

One of the standout features of these trays is the six height adjustments with additional three tilting positions, including one angle downward and another upward. Setting the right height for working on my laptop or comfortably sipping coffee has been so effortless. With height adjustability from 19 to 27 inches and a maximum lifting height of 28.35 inches, these trays genuinely cater to a variety of needs. After some late-night movie snacking, I found myself reclining on the couch with the tray perfect at every tilt angle. It’s also worth mentioning that it stays steady even when adjusted to its maximum height—no wobbling or instability at all.

**Ease of Assembly and Storage**

The slogan of assembling these trays in five minutes or less turned out to be completely true. It took me barely a couple of minutes to have everything up and running! The instructions in the manual were straightforward, allowing even the most assembly-averse individuals (like some of my less patient friends) to put these together without breaking a sweat. Plus, the folding mechanism and compact size ensure it fits into narrow spaces, whether sliding behind a couch or into a closet.

**Pluses**

- Dual functional trays for simultaneous users, addressing individual needs for work or relaxation.  
- Compact when folded, saving tons of space.  
- Tilt and height adjustability make it a dream to customize.  
- Stable bottom balance pole design prevents annoying tipping episodes.

**Bad Points**

- The plastic tabletop isn’t stain-resistant, which is a tad inconvenient during snack-heavy sessions.  
- Black finish sometimes shows smudges easily, requiring frequent wiping.  

**Daily Use and Stability**

One thing I've grown to truly admire about these trays is how stable they feel. Even when loaded with heavier items like a mid-sized laptop and textbooks, they don’t wobble. The bottom balance pole design enhances the stability, and I’ve felt confident leaning on the edges while typing furiously on my laptop keyboard. That being said, pushing it towards the maximum 66-pound weight limit might make you a little nervous, even though it’s unlikely you’d actually need anywhere near that capacity.

**Competing Brands**

These TV trays reminded me of the Table-Mate series, another popular contender in the category. While Table-Mate products are versatile and sturdy, I'd argue that the HUANUO set takes the edge with its modern design and additional tilt options. Conversely, though, Table-Mate models offer smoother stains resistance due to their material quality. The price-to-quality ratio gets competitive here, with HUANUO taking a slight lead for its aesthetic and compact folding benefits. IKEA’s tray tables are another alternative, but they lack the height adjustability and tilting features that make these HUANUO trays so uniquely functional.

**Quality for Price**

The question that often seals any purchase: is it worth it? Based purely on features, I’d say absolutely. Considering the adjustability, ease of storage, and solid design, this offers excellent quality for its price point. Few TV tray models in this range combine functionality, design, and flexibility as seamlessly. They’re ideal for small apartment dwellers, anyone who works remotely, or even students who need flexibility in their study areas. It genuinely feels like a smart investment without stretching the budget unnecessarily.

1ndhf9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/zbook/comments/1ndhf9i/my_personal_experience_and_quick_review_with_hp/,My personal experience and quick review with HP Zbook Firefly 14 G11 A,"Since I cannot find a similar post online about the device, I decided to do it myself :D

Bought my device used for \~ 750 USD with excellent condition (checked and it was originally sold in Sep 2024, still have 2 weeks warranty left), upgraded with a 16 GB RAM stick, and moved my Intel WiFi AX210 card from the previous machine to this one, so the final specs are:

* AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 8840HS with AMD Radeon 780M (4GB allocated for VRAM)
* 32 GB RAM Dual Channel (2 x 16GB)
* 512 GB SSD Micron Model MTFDKBA512TGD-1BK1AABHA
* FullHD+ (16:10 1920 x 1200) IPS - 60 Hz with SureView (AU Optronics AUO26B0)
* 56 Wh battery (with 54 Wh in real use so far, \~ 4% wear level at the time of purchase)
* Intel AX210 WiFi card (Upgraded from original MediaTek)
* Fingerprint + 5MP camera with IR sensors for login
* Ports: 2 x Thunderbolt 4 Type C ports, 2 X USB Type A, 1 x HDMI, 1 x Combo Mic/Headphone Jack.
* 65W charger that came along with the device (USB Type C)
* Keyboard with backlit

You can find the images for the device using this link: [https://www.thurrott.com/hardware/303479/hp-zbook-firefly-14-g11-first-impressions](https://www.thurrott.com/hardware/303479/hp-zbook-firefly-14-g11-first-impressions) (sorry my phone is being repaired, so no photo can be acquired at the moment, and Intel / AMD versions are the same in terms of their look).

I have been using my device for almost 2 weeks now, with use cases mostly involving document editing and typing (Word, Excel, PDF Editor), web browsing, online meetings, light gaming (World of Tanks), video rendering (Full HD 60 FPS), and running some medical device software. About 80% of the time, I plug in my device and set Performance mode in HP Power Manager. The other 20% was used with SmartSense when I travel or work in coffee shops, or when I am unable to find an outlet.

So that's the specs and my use case. Now for the experience and quick review (*please note that this is only my experience in use, no test will be performed, so no official performance results/benchmark are available for now*):

**1. Appearance:** Firefly 14 G11 is made with aluminum case and a silver color, which has a very business look and feel. The case feels sturdy and almost no flex, even under pressure. The screen is nice with a bit / acceptable wobble when putting on the test. The hinge feels sturdy and smooth. And no fingerprint with the metal case. The whole package weight is only about 1.6 kg (adapter included), not too heavy. Overall, a business-class laptop level for appearance. Very nice !!!

2. **Screen:** Bright screen, allows you to work outdoors if required (but I often work indoors, so this is only a plus). Resolution and refresh rate are fine for my use case and needs; others might want a 4K or higher refresh rate if they require more for media usage.

3. **Camera and Microphone**: Decent. Not a top-of-the-line, but more than fine for online meeting on Zoom or GG Meet. Not recommended for anyone who wants to make content on social page though.

4. **Speakers**: Loud and clear. Usually a 30-40% volume is enough for use in quiet room.

5. **Keyboard and trackpad**: Good type feeling that allows accurate typing. Not as good or sastisfy as my old Latitude or other ThinkPad (probably due to key travel) but still fine for my use case (I type about 4-6K words per day, mostly reports and send messages on app. Trackpad is also fine - it's large and accurate.

6. **Sensors (IR and Fingerprint)**: Fast and Reliable. Both work very well for the purpose of login Windows or other apps if required. No complaint.

7. **Performance and Temperature / Fan**:  

**All usual apps** (Office, PDF Reader / Editor, etc.) and other special medical software that I use feel snappy, take little time to open and run smoothly. Overall, the whole experience so far is great.

**Gaming**: I played World of Tanks 2.0 on Low setting, and achieved an average of 180-200 FPS, with the 1% Low somewhere around 160 FPS (please notice that this result is with dual-channel RAM sticks, single-channel will lead to a 30-40% drop in FPS).

**Video rendering**: I managed to render and export \~ 90 mins video (Full HD 60 FPS) in under 35 mins in Performance mode, using Vegas Pro.

**Temp and Fan**: Completely silent and cool to touch with average apps like browsing, but fan got quite loud in gaming or rendering video. CPU Temp manages around 90 °C, and GPU Temp around 70 °C the whole time when doing these heavy tasks (Room temp around 30 °C) with no throttling. You may feel very warm to the touch, especially the left side - surface of the port that is plugged in for power. The palm section is warm but not too uncomfortable.

7. **Battery**: With a brightness set to \~ 200 nits, using HP Power Manager set to SmartSense option, and without any heavy usage like game or rendering, I manage to get from 100 to 50% battery in about \~ 3 hours of continuous usage. I'm fine with the number, since most of time I carry around my adapter, but this may not be an all-day laptop on battery for someone who travels a lot.

**Overall: For my use case, I will give it a solid 9/10**. Good performance, nice appearance with sturdy case, good screen, decent keyboard, and easy to upgrade and repair. The only things I miss are the SD card reader and Ethernet port, which I have to buy a Type-C hub to equip.

We've lived together for almost a year now. We get along great, cook meals together, grocery shop together, etc. But there's one small issue that continues to snowball into a bigger one.. she refuses to do any chores. We don't have valet trash at our apartment complex, so we have to drive our trash from our apartment to the other side of the complex to throw it away in the compactor. several times she's asked me to take the trash before leaving for class, going to work, etc. and I always do. There have been a few times where I was running late so I wasn't able to but then I immediately take it out as soon as I get back because we get fined if we leave trash sitting outside of the door. anytime I've asked her to do that before going home to visit her family, going to class, etc. she always says she will and then I get a text saying she was running late and she wasn't able to take the trash and then she doesn't take it even after she gets back. So then I have to take it. she also has a habit of leaving dishes in her room until the food dries out, the sauce solidifies, and the drinks start to grow mold. She will leave those dirty dishes in the sink without washing them out even if the sink is already overflowing with dishes. I have tried to freeze her out by leaving the trash full in hopes she'll take it out, I've also left the sink full of dishes in hopes that she will do them and she doesn't. The most she'll do is unload the dishwasher. I'm writing this because this morning I hit my breaking point. I was going to take the garbage out with me before my class this morning, but I slept through my alarm so I asked her if she would be willing to take out the garbage before she leaves for her class. I needed this done ASAP because I needed to clean out my cats litter box and there was no room in the trash for it. She told me that she would rather I clean out the litter box and then take out the trash because she didn't want the litter stinking up the apartment. I told her there was already dirty litter in the trash and that the apartment didn't stink because the litter has deodorizer in it to prevent smells, that's also why our laundry room doesn't smell like cat shit. She just said ""Mhmm.."" while ignoring me and making her coffee. I said ""please, can you please just take out the trash this once"", and she finally said, ""Fine, God, I'll do it."" and angrily tied up the trash and slammed the door on her way out. I'm not mad at her, she's my best friend and I love her, but it is beyond frustrating and I just do not know what to do. We both go to school, we both have jobs, but we also both LIVE HERE! I don't expect her to do all of the chores all of the time, but I expect her to at least contribute even a little bit without me having to beg her to do so. And before anyone tries to say that I should just move out, I don't know anyone else here and I can't afford to live on my own and that is not an option. I moved in with her to escape a bad relationship where I was treated like his mother and had to do everything, and now I'm back in the same position where I have to do everything. Any advice on how to handle this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for listening.",0,1757518112.0,roommateproblems,0,0.5,False

I set the budget in title at €100 but honestly I will probably bookmark it and wait for a deal, so anything cheaper is a plus.

You know the posts I'm talking about, the ones stuffed with buzzwords, jargon, or ""humblebrag"" stories that feel more like a resume than a real conversation. Ironically, those posts are usually ignored because they sound like they're written for LinkedIn, not people.

The funny part? The people who do the best on the platform usually do the opposite. They tell messy, real stories. They share something they struggled with. They write the way they actually speak. It's raw, and that's why it works, because it feels like you’re talking to a person, not a brand deck.

Here's what I tell clients:

* **Drop the jargon.** Don't write it on LinkedIn if you wouldn’t say it to a friend over coffee.
* **Lead with honesty.** Share the awkward failure before the shiny lesson.
* **Think conversation, not performance.** People connect to people, not polished personas.

LinkedIn rewards authenticity more than strategy. The strategy *is* authenticity.

It's been almost a month since I started taking Famotidine and have been eating mostly low histamine, and I feel like my body hasn't felt this good in a very very long time. I am 30 btw.

Given that I haven't been able to start medical testing yet (initial Dr appts are scheduled), I still kinda doubt sometimes that my improvement is real.

Today I skipped my Famotidine dose for a bit. Felt like I was feeling pretty good, and no acute symptoms. I'm on some other meds that can give me a bit of an uplift in the morning (Adderall, Loratadine, and also coffee), so I wanted to see if maybe I was perceiving a ""boost"" solely from those - maybe I'm ""better"" now after eating low histamine for a while, or possibly the Famotidine effect was in my head all along lol. Experimentation is the primary tool I have at my disposal right now to learn about my body.

I didn't feel terrible or anything (eating low histamine for 3 days puts me in a wildly better place than otherwise), but after a few hours when the other meds had surely kicked in, I just felt like I couldn't get the ball rolling on my day. Felt a bit tired and meh. And my lower colon felt a little iffy but again not terrible.

I decided to then take my Famotidine and see what happens. What's perhaps most crazy is I feel like I start to notice a difference within 10-15 minutes (and I've felt this way since my first dose 3-4 weeks ago). I know that's fast - perhaps unrealistic but it's what I perceive. I start to feel a little more energized, my abdomen and lower colon start to go from ""meh"" and wobbly (idk how else to concisely describe the sensation), to starting to feel more together and sturdy. Lower colon sensitivity/discomfort starts to subsided. The effect increases before plateauing about 1-1.5 hours after dosage. 

Also in the past I feel like the effect wears off a bit, or even a lot, after 3-4 hours and redosing brings me back.

This. Feels. Delusional. I mean, I know that proper treatment for a condition is obviously going to make a difference. But without being diagnosed and not knowing others with any histamine-related conditions, I can't help but feel like this is all in my head. It just seems unreal.

The first day I had a slice, reasonable and fine. Second day, I had a tiny slice with my coffee and then a tiny slice after dinner. Then a few spoonfuls of chocolate icing, as you do, you know. IYKYK. Then the next day I knew was going to get rid of it so had another slice and more spoonfuls of chocolate icing. The next day my coworkers got me another cake, so had a small slice then. Then yesterday I knew I was going to say no to the cake and wouldn't have cake again for another year so had two MORE small slices. It has officially snowballed.

The result? I Feel Like Shit. I'm just not going to weigh this week. I know what it'll say with all that carbs and sugar even if I don't *think* I went over maintenance and gained real fat. 

Today, I mapped out my full days worth of food, including meal prepping my lunch and dinner, and brought an extra coffee to work to get me thru the inevitable sugar slump to get back on the wagon.

But mostly, I just feel terrible. I have chronic pain and am disabled, and am on day 486 of this food lifestyle change. And I guess eating all that sugar makes me feel terrible. My pain is worse. My energy is down. My head feels fuzzy. And most of all? I want to go eat more cake. I want to finish the bag of popcorn sitting out. I want to eat *everything*.

It's also a realization that even tho I've been doing this well over a year, and have lost over 50lbs, my relationship with food still isn't healthy. It's better.

A few months back I got to know this girl  25f when she was working in sales and I happened to be her customer. At first, we only talked once or twice a week during the process, strictly related to the purchase. Eventually, once everything was done, we stopped talking altogether.

Recently, I had to reach out again for some work and found out she now works at a bank. We agreed she’d help me with a few things and I’d send some leads her way. Since then, she’s been calling me literally every day. But here’s the thing — we barely talk about work. Most of our conversations are casual or just random topics. She even calls me during her lunch or tea breaks, and sometimes there’s not even a topic — she’ll just ask “how are you, what are you doing?” We’ve even ended up talking for hours on the phone.

Also, I haven’t flirted with her or given any signs — she’s the one who always calls. I very rarely call her first, but no matter what, she still makes sure to call me at least once every single day. She also texts sometimes around the same time.

And here’s the funny part: I barely even know many people, but coincidentally in every place she worked, I somehow end up having a common friend or relative in her circle — usually someone at the top level. So in her eyes my aura is basically 10000+ 😅🥲 . She even mentioned, “you have such a good approach and connections.”

By looks, she’s pretty average. But I really love the way she talks  it feels so natural, and I find it very cute.

I’m  sure that if I asked her out for coffee, a drive, or just to spend some time together, she wouldn’t say no. But my doubt is, is this just friendship from her side, or something more? How do I actually know if she’s interested? I really don’t want to ruin my image if she’s not into me and I’m just in delusion.

I don't usually post in this sub, but I've gotten some great info from it, and I got some folks in the hoya sub asking to see my setup. Apologies for the long post. I'm thorough! 

I use the NSW method, which I like because it makes it very easy to flush out the media, and you can still monitor roots without having to use a clear glass vessel that encourages algae growth. However, I also like my plants to be potted in a way that I find esthetically pleasing, and there aren't a lot of ready-made solutions for this setup that aren't 100% plastic. So I've had to get creative.

Basically, I take a net pot or grow pot, add a wick, and then pot the plant in whichever media is suitable for both the plant and the inner pot. Mostly it's LECA, as I find that pon is small enough that it tends to spill through the inner pot into the reservoir, but I do have some in pon. I also have a few in tree fern fiber, which I've mostly reserved for hoyas that prefer a lot of moisture and humidity. 

Anyway, then I place the inner pot in a decorative outer pot (ceramic or colored glass, generally) that's both tall enough to leave some room to form a reservoir, and that has a rim which allows the inner pot to rest on it, essentially suspending the inner pot above the outer one.

Some of these setups work better than others. For hoyas, though, I've recently found that the wide-rimmed net cups used in the pictured hoya (Chouke) with the trellis works really well with coffee mugs. Apparently they also fit wide mouth mason jars very well, which I may eventually try.

I have similar setups for larger plants (ie, aroids), although it tends to get more difficult to find matching inner and outer pots as you go up in size. But it's also been kind of a fun excuse to both flex my creative problem-solving skills AND have an excuse to search thrift shops for cool things to grow plants.

I'm putting together my first-ever passive speaker setup and would love some advice.

I recently gave my Yamaha HS5s (which I used for my TV for music and movies) to my cousin. After a lot of research, I narrowed my choices down to the KEF LSX II LT and a passive setup. And i decided to go with the KEF Q1 Meta paired with a WiiM Amp Pro for more future flexibility.

However, I've had a second thought. My TV has Google TV built-in, which already gives me AirPlay, Netflix, and all the other streaming apps I need. This makes the streaming functionality of the WiiM Amp Pro feel redundant for my main use case.

My one absolute requirement is HDMI ARC/CEC. I really want to control the volume with my TV remote and not add another one to the coffee table.

So, I'm back to looking for an amplifier and have a new shortlist. As a beginner, I'm not sure what the best path is. Here are my current options:

1. Fosi Audio ZD3 + ZA3
2. Arylic B50 (a bit worried this might be underpowered for the KEFs)
3. SMSL PS100 + ZA3
4. Just stick with the WiiM Amp Pro, even if I don't use its streaming features.

What do you think is the best choice from this list? Or is there another great option with HDMI ARC/CEC that would be a good match for the Q1 Meta?

A little more info in case it's helpful: I usually listen from about 2 meters away in a small room that's around 15m²

No amount of coffee fixes it. Life runs smoother if you plan around *energy*, not *time*.

**Build in buffer time.** Treat recovery like part of the event, not an afterthought. That wedding, work trip, or even grocery run? You’ll probably need the next slot clear.

**Heat is the enemy.** A warm room or a humid day can wreck you. Cooling gear is worth every penny.

* Easy wins: frozen berries, cold packs on your wrists, lightweight UV umbrellas, keeping a small desk fan in your bag/car.

**Strange body signals happen.** Pins-and-needles, “phantom water drops,” the feeling your phone buzzed when it didn’t. They can be unsettling, but you’re not going crazy.

**Track your symptoms in your own words.** Using metaphors (“like ants crawling under my skin”) helps both doctors *and* friends understand what you mean.

**Be your own advocate.** If “wait and see” drags on, push for scans, referrals, or second opinions. You’re not being difficult — you’re protecting your health.

**Doctor appointments = brain fog central.** Write down your top 3 questions before you go. Hand the paper over if you blank out.

**Choosing a DMT is not a personality test.** It’s overwhelming to weigh side effects vs. benefits. Ask others *how* they made their decision, not just which drug they picked.

**Online spaces can be surprisingly helpful:**

* [Shift.ms](http://Shift.ms) → peer-to-peer, low drama, genuinely nice vibe.
* MS Society → reliable info & resources.
* [MSTwins.com](http://MSTwins.com) → a newer platform to find MS buddies with the same symptoms or experiences. Tried it and really liked it.
* Juno → a health companion I chat to when brain fog or loneliness hits and vent to when no one else in my family understands — weirdly comforting.

**Communication hacks:**

* “I cancel last minute sometimes, here’s why” lands better than “I have MS.”
* At work, explain impact and adjustments (“I need breaks after standing”) not your entire medical file.

**Have a flare plan.** Who to call, what meds, what rest looks like — write it down in your Notes app like a fire escape plan.

**Move your body (gently).** Neuro physiotherapy or strength work (even light bands) can help more than you’d expect.

**Know your rights.** Disability protections, benefits, travel insurance fine print, and letters for meds when flying — learn them *before* you need them.

**Tech is a lifesaver.** Pill apps, reminder alarms, shared calendars, even template texts for “sorry, I need to reschedule.”

**Grief comes in waves — but so does joy.** Small wins matter. A bad day is just data, not your destiny.

**People will say clumsy things.** Pick a go-to response, reuse it, and save your energy.

**Steal from the community.** Cooling tricks, playlists, symptom metaphors, hacks — crowdsourcing is powerful.",5,1757517096.0,MultipleSclerosisWins,0,1.0,False

1ndgu7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1ndgu7a/atlanta_decatur_vs_st_pete_prioritize_cultural/,Atlanta (Decatur) vs. St. Pete - prioritize cultural fit or being near family,"My husband and I are in our early 30s, trying for our first baby. We moved to Boston for his job and plan to move in about a year. We are torn between being close to family in St. Petersburg, Florida, and living in a place that fits our values and daily rhythm in Decatur, Georgia. If we pick St. Pete, we would live in Historic Old Northeast. If we pick Atlanta, we would live in Oakhurst in the City of Decatur. We can afford homes in both, so budget is not the constraint.

A bit about us. I am a psychologist and he is a psychiatrist. We love indie bookstores, coffee shops, new restaurants, farmers markets, festivals, cultural events, and theme parks like Disney and Universal. I am on an improv team and would like to join one after the move. He would like to find a writing group. We want a socially progressive, diverse, inclusive, and warm environment, and walkability matters a lot to us.

We lived in Decatur for four years and loved it. It has a small town feel while being very progressive, and there are many young professional families. Public schools are a big priority for us and Decatur’s reputation is a strong draw. My current therapy group is based there. I work virtually now but like the idea of working in person again, and we have more professional connections in Atlanta. My job would be in downtown Decatur, so living in Oakhurst would mean a very short commute.

The family picture looks different depending on the choice. If we move to Decatur, my mom plans to move to Georgia after she retires, likely in two to four years, but she would probably live about 40 minutes north around Marietta. My dad says he will move when we move, but he has said that in the past and does not love Atlanta, so I am not sure he will follow through. We also had a tight knit friend group in Decatur that has since moved away, so we wonder what life will feel like there without those friends, even though we expect to make new ones.

If we move to St. Pete, both of my parents are already in Clearwater about 25 to 30 minutes away, my best friend who is like a sister is in Odessa about 40 minutes away, and my stepbrother is in Tampa. The pull is the pre existing community and the beauty of living on the water. Historic Old Northeast is very walkable, which is a big plus. If we choose St. Pete we suspect we would send our kids to private school even though we prefer public. My husband feels like St. Pete is similar enough to Decatur in being a progressive, walkable city and a beautiful neighborhood, whereas I worry a bit more about it being a fit. 

Politics are a concern for me. We are liberal, and Florida’s recent policies around vaccines, LGBTQ rights, and immigration give me pause. I know both Florida and Georgia have 6 week abortion bans, and Georgia is purple at best, but Florida feels more like a conservative stronghold. I would love to hear how that actually feels day to day for people in St. Pete.

So here is what we are trying to sort out. 

1) Has anyone moved primarily to be near family even if the city was not an ideal fit, and how did that play out in years 0 to 3 with a baby.

2) If you are liberal and live in a progressive Florida city like St. Pete or Miami, do you feel state politics in your daily life or does the local culture buffer it?

3) On the flip side, has anyone chosen a city that was a great personal fit but far from family, and what made that workable or not with an infant or toddler.

I’d love to hear from people with similar backgrounds/interests who live in either of these cities and what life is like for you. 

TL;DR: early 30s couple, psychologist and psychiatrist, choosing between Oakhurst in Decatur for culture and school fit with no nearby family for two to four years, and Historic Old Northeast in St. Pete for immediate family nearby and a walkable waterfront neighborhood but likely private school. Which would you prioritize and why?

Edited to add:
- We plan to live in Boston until we have our first child due to the dangers of having a child in a state with really strict abortion laws. ",3,1757517018.0,SameGrassButGreener,15,1.0,False

anw, i would just like to know if this can delay my period as i have been slightly worried as i did have unprotected sex with my boyfriend this month (around 10 days ago), tho we used the pullout method. i took a pt today and it came out negative but i still haven't gotten my period so i am still a bit worried.",1,1757517012.0,Periods,0,1.0,False

  Dear God, if I’d wanted to break up elementary school fights, I would’ve become a teacher.  
  
  Headed into the second leg of a double shift, Officer Judd Hamilton tried his best to clamp down on the irritation. He had, after all, volunteered to organize FountainFest safety for the police department. And if that meant keeping Jim Vernon and Neil Faber from coming to blows over who got to kick off the 1-mile Fun Run, then that’s what he’d do.  
  
  Beyond the two geezers, he caught a glimpse of his girlfriend, Mary Alice, smiling at him. Her group of third graders were obviously excited about the race but behaved themselves. Unlike these two. He really wished he could put the pair of them in time out.  
  
  Instead, he tried his best to channel the calm, reasonable tone he’d heard Mary Alice use on her class. “Look, gentleman, I respect the fact that you were both told you could fire the starter pistol. I know it’s a big honor—” for the three seconds it will take for everyone to forget you were ever there, “and neither of you wants to be disappointed, but let’s have a little bit of perspective and festival goodwill, okay?”  
  
  “I’m not giving up my place!” insisted Jim.  
  
  “Why you old—”  
  
  Judd inserted himself bodily between them. “Y’all simmer down, or neither of you is doing anything.” His over-tired mind raced, looking for a solution that didn’t involve him plunking both of them in a cell for the duration of the festival. Somebody somewhere had to have some more blanks. “Look, if we can come up with a second starter pistol, you could both take the shot starting the race simultaneously. Equals. Is that acceptable?”  
  
  “I don’t know…” Jim waffled.  
  
  “Wouldn’t it look good to the townspeople to see the presidents of the Kiwanis and Rotary Clubs joint officiating?” Judd pushed.  
  
  “Well, I suppose that might be okay,” Neil allowed.  
  
  “As long as we both get to have our banners,” Jim insisted.  
  
  “One on each side of the starting line,” Judd promised.  
  
  “I can live with that,” said Neil.  
  
  “Good. Great. Y’all do that. Banners in place on those barricades, and y’all get in position. The race should be starting in fifteen minutes.”  
  
  Jesus. Was all this extra crap really worth enduring for the chance to be Chief of Police?  
  
  Of course it was. Because being Chief wasn’t the end goal. It was just a means to an end.  
  
  He waited until the combatants scurried off to their respective civic groups, then radioed to find some blanks. Couldn’t very well have civilians firing actual shots when town was crawling with pedestrians for the first annual Wishful FountainFest. Looking at the throngs of people, Judd couldn’t help but wish their city planner wasn’t quite so good at her job. The department didn’t have the manpower to adequately police this many people.  
  
  Should’ve called in some of the off-duty deputies from the county.  
  
  But the departmental budget couldn’t afford that either. Still, he’d seen at least two of the deputies in the crowd. Men he trusted, who could handle themselves. If anything went down, they’d lend a hand. Not that anything was likely to happen, but Judd had plenty of personal experience that made him less complacent than most.  
  
  As soon as the starter pistol situation was taken care of, Judd walked over to Mary Alice. Her sunny hair was pulled through the back of a FountainFest ball cap, and she was dressed to run in a t-shirt and shorts that showed off her toned legs. The sight gave him a bit of a jolt. He was so used to her conservative, elementary school attire, he often forgot what was underneath. Which was a terrifying sign of exactly how much he’d been working these last few months.  
  
  Need to rectify that.  
  
  “Kyle, pull your shorts up. Does anybody have to go to the bathroom before we get started?”  
  
  “Everything under control here?” Judd asked.  
  
  She looked up, blue eyes twinkling. “As in control as it ever is.”  
  
  “At least they’re better behaved than the race officials,” he observed.  
  
  “You get whatever that was sorted?” Her gaze slipped past his shoulder. “Danielle, stop picking your nose.”  
  
  “Barely. Race will be starting in just a bit.” A jaw-splitting yawn interrupted the statement.  
  
  She gave his arm a sympathetic squeeze. “Hang in there. Once this double is over, you’ll be off for four whole days.”  
  
  “Thank God.” The prospect of eight straight on a horizontal surface was more appealing than Venus herself.  
  
  With a quick glance at her charges, Mary Alice stepped into him, rising on her toes. Judd still had to lean down so she could whisper in his ear. “Maybe after you’ve slept, we could spend some quality time together. Do a little catching up.”  
  
  He hummed his approval at that idea, thinking about getting reacquainted with those legs of hers. A flash of red hair distracted him from the suggestion of what they could do with some of that quality time. Judd told himself the sudden jump in his heart rate was due entirely to the less than G-rated thoughts he’d just been entertaining about Mary Alice.  
  
  Autumn Buchanan, his oldest, dearest friend, cut through the crowd with Boudreaux, Judd’s massive bloodhound-mastiff mix, trotting beside her on a leash. She’d been dogsitting while he’d been on nights the last week. Livia Applewhite, one of her closest girlfriends, trailed in her wake. Judd straightened, eyes zeroing in on the number pinned to Autumn’s chest.  
  
  “Good morning, y’all,” Autumn called cheerily.  
  
  She and Livia both launched into greetings to the children they knew from the library, introducing them to Boudreaux. The dog sat, patiently enduring the kids’ adoration.  
  
  “Are y’all looking forward to the race?” Livia asked.  
  
  As she drew the children into excited conversation, Autumn stepped forward, extending the to-go cup in her hand. “I come on a mission of mercy. A Zombie Killer from The Grind. Extra shot of caramel, just how you like it. Figured you’d be dragging about now. Plus Boudreaux’s missing his daddy.”  
  
  Judd automatically took the cup in one hand, and gave his dog a head rub with the other, but he couldn’t tear his eyes off of Autumn. “Thanks. What are you wearing?”  
  
  She glanced down at her shorts and fitted tank top, which displayed miles of lean, toned legs and arms that he forced himself to ignore. “I realize you’re on a double, but if you’re so tired you don’t recognize running gear, I’m not sure you should be on duty.”  
  
  “I’m talking about the race number.”  
  
  She deliberately widened her green eyes at him. “It’s called participation.”  
  
  “You’re not running.” With a struggle, he managed to make it a question rather than an order.  
  
  “I am, actually. Livia, Riley, and I are doing it together.”  
  
  Frustration whipped through him. “You aren’t supposed to exert yourself. Dr. Webb said—”  
  
  “That exercise is good for my heart.”  
  
  “He meant yoga or swimming.” Hadn’t he? Nice non-competitive stuff that wouldn’t get her heart rate or blood pressure up. Nothing that might aggravate her heart condition.  
  
  “It’s a one mile fun run, not a triathalon. Besides, Boudreaux is looking forward to some exercise. Aren’t you, boy?” She scratched behind his ears, and Boudreaux pressed into her touch, eyes rolling back in bliss.  
  
  Missing his daddy, my ass.  
  
  “Boudreaux’s idea of exercise is walking from the sofa down to the end of my dock.”  
  
  “Which should be proof enough that I won’t be over exerting myself. Stop worrying, Grandpa.”  
  
  That was like ordering him not to breathe. He couldn’t just turn off twenty-five years of protective instincts. Not when he could still so clearly see her lying in that hospital bed, hooked up to half a dozen monitors and machines.  
  
  Someone’s voice boomed over a bullhorn. “Everybody participating in the F  
un Run please take your position behind the starting line. The race will begin in five minutes.”  
  
  “We should go find Riley,” Livia said.  
  
  “Gotta go.” Autumn was already turning away before he could think of any other rational arguments against her running in this race. “Drink the coffee, Judd. You’ll feel better. Bye, Mary Alice!”  
  
  Beside him, Mary Alice lifted her hand in a wave. “She’ll be fine.”  
  
  Judd grunted a response and scanned the course to see what medical personnel were on duty in case something went wrong. The First Aid tent was about thirty yards away on one corner of the town green. They were more expecting scraped knees and sprains, but a defibrillator would be there. And he had his own EMT training to fall back on in an emergency.  
  
  None of it made him feel any better, but short of bodily stopping her from participating, it was the best he could do. Not that she’d had any incidents in years, and her last check-up with her cardiologist, three months before, had given her an all clear.  
  
  Judd blinked, realizing Mary Alice had been talking to him. “Sorry. What?”  
  
  A flicker of exasperation passed over her pretty face. “I asked if you’d be up in time tomorrow for us to go to your family’s Sunday brunch?”  
  
  “Yeah, sure. Mom’s been fussing she hasn’t seen me.” It’d be good to see his family. Plus he needed to firm up plans to go shopping with Autumn for his brothers’ birthday. No one was better at coming up with the best gag gifts for the twins than she was.  
  
  “No one outside the department has seen you since you went on nights a month ago.”  
  
  “Part of the job.” He shrugged. “Race is about to start. Y’all have fun and be careful.”  
  
  He bent to give her an absent kiss and hit her cheek when she turned at the last moment. Okay, so she was annoyed. He’d work on smoothing that over once this shift was done and he’d slept. He headed further up the street, judging the best spot to keep an eye out for Autumn. Just in case. The race course ran the length of the green, down Main Street, onto Franklin Street before looping back on Market Street to finish on the opposite side of the green. If she had issues, it would be on the tail end of the course. He positioned himself on the far corner of the green at Main and Spring Streets to watch the start.  
  At 6’3”, Judd could see over most of the crowd, so when the starter pistols went off—in tandem, thank God—he kept an eagle eye on the surge of people flowing down Main Street. With her bright flash of hair, Autumn was easy to pick out. She, Riley, and Livia were in a tight cluster, with Boudreaux trotting ahead. None of them was going faster than a jog. He could tell Autumn was even talking and laughing as they went. The tightness in his chest eased a fraction.  
  
  “I don’t think Boudreaux quite knows what to think about all these people.” Mitch Campbell, one of Judd’s poker buddies, stepped up to the curb to watch the girls.  
  
  “We both know he’d follow Autumn anywhere.”  
  
  “Didn’t know she was running.”  
  
  “Neither did I,” Judd grumbled. But at least she was being smart about it. No outright sprinting. And honestly, Autumn was never reckless with her health. She just seemed to worry about it a lot less than he did.  
  
  “Not sure you can call what they’re doing running,” Mitch observed as they disappeared from view.  
  
  Judd turned to make his way to the opposite corner, across from Sweet Magnolias Bakery, aware of Mitch falling into step beside him.  
  
  “Man, you look like warmed over death this morning.”  
  
  “Thanks for that. Coffee hasn’t kicked in.” He drained it on the walk, feeling a rush of gratitude that Autumn had thought of it. With all his herding of people this morning, there hadn’t been time to go by The Daily Grind himself.  
  
  “You gonna make it to poker night next week now you’re finally off nights?”  
  
  “That’s the plan. But I’ve gotta work on digging myself out of the dog house with Mary Alice. I’ve been working my ass off and neglecting her lately.” Longer than lately, if he was honest with himself.  
  
  “Man, buy her something shiny. Never met a woman who couldn’t be appeased with jewelry and flowers.”  
  
  “Jewelry’s never been my style.”  
  
  “Even better,” Mitch declared, thumping him on the back. “She won’t expect it and it’ll be a surprise.”  
  
  “You sure?” Judd asked. Didn’t gifts of jewelry come with certain expectations?  
  
  “Absolutely. Go by Sanderson’s and ask Rosanna about the dog house special. She’s got a good selection of options.”  
  
  Judd spared Mitch a glance. “You sound like you have a lot of experience with this.”  
  
  “Well, I’m still friends with all my exes.”  
  
  There.  
  
  Autumn came into view, moving with the same unhurried jog she’d had at the start. Boudreaux trotted obediently beside her, periodically looking up at her in complete adoration. Her cheeks were flushed from exertion, but not alarmingly so. She was okay, exactly as she’d said she’d be. The tension in his muscles drained out, and Judd could practically hear her in his head, See there, Grandpa.  
  
  Turning back to Mitch, he said, “But they’re exes.”  
  
  “Only because I got out before any of them got too serious. Talk to Rosanna. She won’t steer you wrong.”  
  
  What the hell? It couldn’t hurt.

  “We need a plan of attack.”  
  
  Autumn looked with affectionate forbearance across the table at her best friend. “It’s shopping for birthday presents, Judd, not a war.”  
  
  “Same difference. There are people.” His sharp blue eyes narrowed on the word.  
  
  She smiled into her coffee. “You’re just grumpy because you haven’t recovered from FountainFest and all those extra shifts you’ve been pulling.”  
  
  “Hell yes. Ergo, I want to get through this whole process as quickly as possible.” He inhaled a quarter of his tall stack of pancakes in about three bites, as if to to prove the point.  
  
  “We could have done this sooner if you weren’t working all the time,” she chided.  
  
  “Couldn’t be helped. Chief Curry’s been leaning on me pretty heavy lately.”  
  
  “Which is exactly what you wanted.”  
  
  Judd shrugged. “I figured the decision about the replacement Chief would’ve been made by now. Nobody thought this would drag on for over a year. Either way, this is the time we’ve got, and gag gifts must be procured. It’s tradition.”  
  
  Curmudgeon or not, Judd Hamilton was reliable as the rising sun. Since the pair of them were old enough to ride their bikes downtown, they’d established an annual tradition of finding the best possible gag gifts for his twin brothers. Since she’d been an honorary Hamilton for more than a decade, she took great pleasure in punking Leo and Eli.  
  
  As they polished off their breakfast, and he wrote out a list of stops like he was planning a tactical assault, Mama Pearl brought their check. Autumn started to reach for it, but Judd’s hand shot out and snagged it.  
  
  “What are you doing?”  
  
  “Buying breakfast,” he said.  
  
  Autumn bristled. “I can buy my own breakfast.”  
  
  “You’ve been working on half-time hours since spring. I’ve been working overtime. Ergo, I’m buying breakfast.”  
  
  “Don’t be an ass.”  
  
  “I’m an ass for buying my oldest friend breakfast?” He fixed her with that cop stare that was meant to intimidate but instead heated things that had no business heating.  
  
  Autumn shifted in her seat, crossing her legs to get more comfortable and bumping his instead. A zing of awareness shot from her kneecap further north and she repressed the urge to curse, focusing instead on keeping every nuance of her expression dialed to annoyed rather than attracted. God knew, she had plenty of practice.  
  
  Before she could come up with an answer that wasn’t some shade of “I don’t need you to take care of me”—which would just piss him off—Mama Pearl came back.  
  
  She gave a hmmph that conveyed a wealth of opinion over their stalemate before handing Autumn a thick envelope. “Omar sent this out. You won the pool on Tucker and Corinne.”  
  
  Judd tossed down his napkin. “Of course you did. How many does this make?”  
  
  “Seventeen,” Autumn said sweetly, plucking the check from his hand and pulling three fives from the envelope to pass back to Mama Pearl.  
  
  He stared at her. “Seriously?”  
  
  “What can I say? I’m lucky when it comes to betting on love.” Which was an enormous crock of shit. She’d never been brave enough to gamble with him. Until today.  
  
  “She is the reigning champion,” Mama Pearl confirmed, before ambling off to get her change.  
  
  “What’s your secret?” Judd asked.  
  
  “Secret?”  
  
  “Why is it you’re so good at picking who’s going to end up with who and when?”  
  
  He absolutely wouldn’t like the answer to that. Reminding Judd that she was adept at reading people’s body language because she’d grown up in a household where understanding that meant the difference between surviving her father’s crazy pseudo-religious delusions and getting the belt—or worse—would ruin the mood of the day. He’d gotten her out years ago. That was the important thing. Besides, it was a lot more fun using her skills for love instead of survival.  
  
  Now her brain was occupied with broaching a far more terrifying topic. How exactly did you tell your best friend you’re in love with him?  
  
  “Maybe it’s all those romance novels. It’s made me extra sensitive to spotting the signs. And anyway, betting on love sure as hell beats editing dissertations for foreign students in terms of supplementing my income.”  
  
  His lips quirked in that devil-may-care grin that made her heart stutter. “You’ve actually made enough on this to supplement your income?”  
  
  It wasn’t the only supplement to her income, but it was the only one he need know about. She made a show of fanning the remaining cash in the envelope. “I just got handed all my shopping money. For the twins and for a splurge.”  
  
  “Then I guess we’d better go spend it.”  
  
  Per tradition, stop number one was the fountain in the middle of the town green. Constructed just after the Civil War, the fountain had earned some local notoriety over the past century and a half. It was, after  
all, why the town was named Wishful. Usually Autumn tossed in her coin and made a less selfish wish—there were plenty of other people who could use a little bit of magic. But if she was really going through with this, she needed all the help she could get. She’d even saved a silver dollar specially for the occasion. The coin lay sweaty against her palm. She stared down at the smooth surface of the water, trying to slow her heart and think of the right way to phrase the wish.  
  
  “You okay, Firefly?”  
  
  The childhood nickname pulled her back to the past, to the first time they’d stood here and the wish she’d made then. The casual stroke down her back kept her in the now.  
  
  “You know, when we were twelve and you brought me here that first time, I didn’t believe in wishes. Didn’t see the point. But you gave me a quarter and told me to make a wish anyway. For anything I wanted. Do you know what I wished for?”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  She lifted her gaze to his face. “I wished for a new family. And you gave me yours. I can never repay you for that.”  
  
  “We’re not keeping a balance sheet, Autumn. It’s not something you owe us for.”  
  
  No. That’d been a gift without price. And if she did this. If she changed things, his friendship wasn’t the only thing she risked.  
  
  Be brave. Be the strong heroine you write about.  
  
  Eyes on his, she fisted the silver dollar and made her wish. I wish for the courage and strength of heart to do what needs to be done, say what needs to be said.  
  
  She didn’t look as she tossed the coin. Didn’t even glance over at the solid thunk in the water. She could only watch him. For twenty-five years, he’d been her strength, her shield, her confidant. And she was about to see if he’d be more.  
  
  “Judd, there’s something I need to—”  
  
  “Autumn!”  
  
  The sound of her name had the words clogging like a logjam in her throat as she turned to see who had such craptastic timing.  
  
  “Mark?”  
  
  A history professor at Wachoxee County Community College, Mark Caulfield had been stopping in at the library once or twice a week for a couple of years. He was charming, erudite, and a little shy. Lanky, with a penchant for tweed—a less attractive Jude Law type. Livia had been making bets for months about when Mark would get up the nerve to ask Autumn out. He always seemed to stop just short of crossing the line from flirtation to action. Which was perfectly fine with Autumn. She enjoyed their flirtation, enjoyed the lack of pressure to actually commit to anything else. And here he was with flowers in his hand when she was about to confess her love to Judd.  
  
  Crap on a cracker.  
  
  “Good morning, lovely lady.” With a sheepish smile, he held a bouquet of bright yellow tulips out.  
  
  Autumn reached to take the flowers automatically, though a part of her instinctively recoiled. She couldn’t stop the flinch as her hand curled around the stems. “What’s this?”  
  
  “I saw these and they made me think of you. A little spot of sunshine. I went by the library to deliver them. Livia told me you were out shopping, so I took a chance that I could catch you.”  
  
  Autumn made a mental note to murder her friend. She forced a smile and focused on the gesture rather than the flowers themselves. There was no possible way Mark could’ve known she loathed yellow tulips. They’d been her mother’s favorite flower. “They’re lovely.”  
  
  She waited, watching splotches of color rise to Mark’s cheeks as he shifted from foot to foot. Please don’t let today be the day he finally asks.  
  
  Mark finally seemed to register Judd’s presence, which said a lot about the man’s focus on her, as Judd had been looming behind her like a guard dog since the moment Mark had shown up.  
  
  “Hi. Mark Caulfield.” He offered his hand.  
  
  Judd stepped forward to take it. “Judd Hamilton.”  
  
  “And you’re—”  
  
  “The best friend,” Judd supplied. His gaze swept Mark from head to toe and clearly found him lacking. Not that anyone who wasn’t well-versed in the microexpressions of Judd would notice.  
  
  “Ah,” Mark said.  
  
  The silence spun out. One beat, then two.  
  
  Ordinarily, Autumn would’ve jumped into the breach, tried to put Mark more at ease with the scripted niceties used by all women in the South. But she wanted—needed—him to go away. So she said nothing, employing the same tactics she knew Judd used in interrogation, hoping Mark would be so acutely uncomfortable, he’d lose his nerve.  
  
  “Well, I—you’re in the middle of something. I just wanted to give you the flowers. I’ll let you get back to your shopping now.”  
  
  “Thanks.”  
  
  “I guess I’ll see you when those interlibrary loans come in.”  
  
  “I’ll be sure to let you know,” she promised.  
  
  Mark gave a little wave and shrugged his messenger bag higher on his shoulder, heading back across the green.  
  
  Autumn turned back toward Judd. She felt the weight of his gaze—those eyes that always saw too much and not enough.  
  
  “Do you want me to take them?” He knew. Of course, he knew what these would mean to her. It was just one of the many reasons she loved him.  
  
  “No. They’re just…flowers. I can deal. Just…just tell me when he’s gone so I can find somewhere to dispose of them.”  
  
  Mark’s interruption had seriously thrown Autumn off her game. Because the moment to speak had passed, she didn’t resist when Judd took her arm. “C’mon. Let’s walk.”  
  
  “Let’s swing by Brides and Belles. I’ll give them to Babette. Someone might as well enjoy them.”  
  
  “Sure. I’ve got something to pick up in that area anyway.”  
  
  Dimly, Autumn wondered where, but was too rattled to ask. She’d find out soon enough.  
  
  She felt better once the flowers were out of her hands. Steadier. She joined Judd back out on the sidewalk. “Okay, List Master, where is our first stop? You said you had something to pick up over here.”  
  
  “This way.” He headed down the block. As she fell into step beside him, he said, “Hey what was it you were going to say earlier? Before we were interrupted. You seemed pretty serious.”  
  
  “I was. I…” Autumn trailed off, staring blankly at the display window he’d stopped in front of. “What are we doing here?”  
  
  “Oh, I’ve just got to run in and pick up something for Mary Alice.”  
  
  “Here?” she said dumbly. Because they were standing outside Sanderson’s Jewelers.  
  
  “Yeah, I’ve got something on order. Want to come in and see?”  
  
  Autumn’s mind ground to a screeching halt, as everything she’d been about to say simply blanked. Judd Hamilton did not buy jewelry. At no point in their twenty-five years of friendship had he ever given something sparkly to one of his girlfriends. He’d never even gotten any cheesetastic jewelry for his mom on Mother’s Day. And he had something on order for Mary Alice.  
  
  There was only one thing it could possibly be.  
  
  Something burst inside her, a white hot nova of shock sweeping through her body. Autumn felt the reverberation in her chest and for long seconds she waited for the physical pain to take her to her knees. But there was no pain. She wasn’t dying this time, even though she was losing him now as surely as she’d nearly lost him years ago to a bullet meant for her. And for a moment she regretted that the surgeons had repaired her heart. Because that meant she had to live through this, watching him build a life with someone else, knowing she’d never even been in the running.  
  
  She drew on every shred of control she had to smile at him. Because she loved him and she wanted him to be happy.  
  
  “No. That’s what I wanted to tell you. I’m going to have to bail on our tradition. I’m supposed to meet Mitzi to help finish up a grant for the library. With all the budget cuts, I really can’t afford to tell her no, even though it’s technically my day off. There’s a deadline.” The lie rolled off her tongue with surprising ease.  
  
  “Well shit. Why didn’t you say something earlier?”  
  
  “She just emailed me this morni  
ng, and I thought we could at least do breakfast. But I need to get on. You go ahead and finish your shopping. I’ll see you later, okay?”  
  
  Worry was written all over his face as he studied her.  
  
  Please. Please let me go right now.  
  
  “Yeah, okay.”  
  
  Because she felt the weight of his gaze on her, she didn’t run, though every instinct urged her to flee. She kept her strides even and unhurried, though she was starting to shake. She kept her head held high, though she wanted to scream. She’d survived more than her fair share over the years. She’d find a way to survive this.  
  
  But as she passed the cursed fountain, she wondered how she’d survive it without him.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  Autumn was lying.  
  
  That fact didn’t concern Judd nearly as much as the why behind it. She was a lot more upset about the flowers than she wanted to admit. He’d seen her face, seen that subtle loss of color in her cheeks as she’d accepted them. The poor bastard couldn’t have known the dark associations she had with yellow tulips. Caulfield had effectively killed any shot he might’ve had with Autumn—if he’d had a shot to begin with. She hadn’t looked thrilled to see him.  
  
  Was she having the nightmare again? And what the hell could Judd do about it if she was?  
  
  The question circled his brain as he stepped back out of Sanderson’s. Had she looked more anxious the last few weeks? Shown any signs of being less rested than usual? Had she seemed off somehow? He didn’t know and that pissed him off. He was her best friend. He ought to know these things. But he’d been working so damned much, he’d barely seen her. He’d seen Mary Alice even less—hence the apology bracelet he’d just picked up. He hoped Mitch was right and it would take him out of the running for world’s worst boyfriend. The fact was, his relationships had been taking a backseat to the job lately, and that needed to change.",1,1757516814.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1ndgq4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1ndgq4n/tips_on_how_to_avoid_getting_generic_answers_when/,Tips on How to Avoid Getting Generic Answers When Networking With Big Law Attorneys (2025 Update),"**Hello recruits!** 

So we all kind of know that building a professional network is crucial for law students and lawyers, but one common challenge I notice a lot of folks face (especially when they start to network consistently and often) is **turning initial conversations into meaningful, memorable interactions with data that actually affects your decisions.** 

Often, law students feel like they’re getting **generic responses,** which on the whole are pretty unhelpful, or they’re not truly connecting with the attorneys they meet––for example, they might just be getting the usual “firm spiel” with information that you can mostly find by just reading the firms marketing materials. 

So how do you avoid getting those kinds of answers? Here are a few quick tips that might help you ask the right questions and steer the conversation towards deeper, more specific topics, that ultimately allow you to make a memorable impression and most importantly, collect information that is valuable and actionable to you.

\*As a quick caveat, this is one of those skills that is an art and a practice. Taking the time to sharpen your arsenal of conversational fact finding isn’t something that happens overnight or is even something that you or I can copy-paste from someone else. This process takes iteration, so keep chugging along and tweaking your questions to get the most bang for your buck when you talk to attorneys.

# 🎨 1. “Paint Me A Picture”: Move Beyond Generic Questions

The biggest mistake law students make in networking conversations is asking overly broad or vague questions. If you're asking things like ""What's the firm culture like?"" or ""Can you tell me about your practice?"", you'll often receive generic responses that aren’t particularly helpful.

Instead, **ask questions that require the attorney to ""paint a picture""** of their experiences. (You can literally even start your questions with “Can you paint me a picture of XYZ?”)

Getting them to recall specific moments or examples will yield richer insights for you and keep the conversation engaging for them.

For instance, if you're interested in mentorship at a firm, don’t simply ask, ""Does your firm have a mentorship program?"" That will likely result in a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer or a generic description of a formal program. Instead, try something like:

* **""Can you paint me a picture of what your relationship with your mentor/mentee looks like?""**
* **“For the last meeting with your mentor, what did you guys discuss?”**
* **“As you were leaving the meeting, did you feel like he helped you think about that thing differently?**

Try to ask for things in the realm of who, what, when, where, how (imagine yourself as a mini-investigative journalist here). 

**👀 1a) Another effective technique is to ask open-ended questions that invoke sensory details**—things that the attorney can see, feel, or touch. This approach encourages them to think more vividly and share richer, more specific answers.

**So ask for details that relate to human senses**––this might sound ridiculous but hear me out. If you read a story, you’ll probably be able to picture something much more clearly if the details of what that scene are laid out to be. 

Like if I told you about the last time I spoke to my mentor, I could tell you that “Oh we met in person, after I texted him, at a small coffee shop in downtown that always bakes fresh bagels, where he likes to take long coffee breaks to decompress, he’s always dressed to the nines in a suit, I can always hear the excitement in his voice and tempo if he’s working on something new, etc etc etc.”

These are all details of what you can see, hear, touch, smell, etc. You get a clearer picture of who that person is and what our dynamic is like if you ask questions that invite that kind of description. 

So where you can, try asking a person to describe real scenarios, so you gain a much clearer sense of what they are actually talking about.

# 🤔 2. Be Specific About What You Want to Know

Another key to a productive conversation is having a clear goal in mind. Think about what aspects of firm life or the attorney's career path you genuinely want to learn about. Then, tailor your questions accordingly.

For example, if you’re interested in how attorneys at the firm handle work-life balance, avoid the general question, “What’s the work-life balance like here?” Instead, ask something like:

* **""What strategies do you have in your pocket to manage your time when you're working on multiple matters at once?""**

A specific, targeted question will give you real examples of how attorneys manage their workload and personal time. Plus, they can lead to more personal stories, which are much more likely to facilitate a genuine conversation between you two and leave a lasting impression on both you and the person you're speaking with.

# 😎 3. Ask About Experiences, Not Policies

If you ask attorneys about firm policies, you’ll probably get standard responses that don’t reveal much. Instead, focus on asking about personal experiences.

For example, if you're curious about diversity initiatives, you might be tempted to ask, ""What is your firm doing to promote diversity?"" A better approach is to ask:

* **""What has your experience been like as a \[specific demographic\] attorney here?""**
* **""Have you participated in any diversity-related initiatives or groups at the firm? Which ones? Do you feel they’ve changed your experience as an attorney here for the better?""**

Asking for experiences someone personally had will provide you with more authentic responses and may also open the door to discussing more nuanced aspects of the firm's culture, so you can get candid feedback on the firm––including the good, bad, and the ugly.

# 🖋️ 5. Take Notes and Follow Up

Once you’ve had these meaningful conversations, the next step is maintaining those relationships. **Take notes** during or after each conversation, even if super brief. 

What stood out to you? What did they say about mentorship, work culture, or their career path that you can refer back to later?

I say this because, as you follow up, you can mention something specific from your previous conversation. 

For example, “You mentioned that your mentor took you out to lunch every month to catch up—have you had any recent lunches with them? What was that like? What’d you talk about? Was it helpful and how?” Small details like this show that you were actively listening and that you value the advice they shared.

1ndgoiy,https://i.redd.it/dh5ijpu9rcof1.jpeg,Decorating with Ottomans and Benches,"Big furniture pieces like a sectional sofa or a genuine leather sofa usually steal the spotlight in a home. But if you’ve ever added an ottoman or a bench to your space, you already know how powerful small furniture can be. These pieces don’t take up much room, yet they add comfort, flexibility, and a surprising amount of style.

What makes ottomans and benches so appealing is how versatile they are. Unlike a heavy dining table or a bulky leather sectional, they’re lightweight, easy to move, and fit almost anywhere—living rooms, bedrooms, dining areas, or even entryways. They’re the kind of furniture that works hard without asking for much space.

# What Exactly Are Ottomans and Benches?

At their core, ottomans and benches are simple pieces, but their uses are endless.

* **Ottomans** are cushioned seats without backs. They can be round, square, or rectangular. Some sit on legs with a sleek mid century modern look, while others are poufs that rest directly on the floor. They’re not just for resting your feet—you can use them as extra seating, or even as a coffee table by placing a tray on top.
* **Benches** are longer, rectangular pieces. They’re often seen at the end of a bed, by the dining table, or right by the front door as a landing spot for shoes and bags. Storage benches add another layer of function, giving you a place to stash linens, pillows, or anything you’d rather keep out of sight.

Both pair beautifully with bigger furniture. Whether you’ve got a leather sectional sofa, a faux leather couch, or a small space sofa in your apartment, these small pieces add charm without overcrowding the room.

# Why Ottomans Work So Well in Living Rooms

If there’s one place where an ottoman shines, it’s the living room. Think about those times when friends come over. Even with a sectional sofa, seating can run short. An ottoman instantly solves the problem—extra seats without dragging in another chair.

Beyond seating, ottomans make flexible tables. Put a tray on top, and suddenly you have a coffee table for drinks, snacks, or books. Later, just move the tray aside and kick your feet up. Unlike a hard wooden table, an upholstered ottoman brings comfort and softness into the room.

Style-wise, they’re incredibly adaptable. A neutral tan ottoman blends with almost any space, while a teal velvet ottoman makes a bold statement and pairs beautifully with a genuine leather sofa. That mix of color and texture brings life into a living room without feeling forced.

# Benches: More Than Just Extra Seating

Benches shine in dining areas and kitchens. They tuck neatly under the table when not in use, keeping the space open and uncluttered. In open-concept homes, benches also act as a visual bridge between the dining area and living room, making gatherings feel more connected and casual.

They’re not limited to dining rooms, though. In small kitchens, a compact upholstered ottoman can double as a side table. And if you pick a storage bench, it gives you a clever spot to hide linens, dishes, or anything you don’t want on display.

# Ottomans and Benches in Bedrooms

Bedrooms gain both function and style from these pieces. A bench at the end of the bed completes the look of the room and gives you a spot to sit while tying your shoes or folding laundry.

Storage benches are especially practical here—perfect for hiding away blankets, pillows, or off-season clothes. On the softer side, a fur or boucle bench adds warmth and texture, making the space feel cozy.

Smaller ottomans also work well as vanity seating. Unlike a bulky chair, they save space while keeping the room feeling open and uncluttered.

# How They Pair with Larger Furniture

The best part about ottomans and benches is how well they complement big furniture.

* Place an ottoman in front of a sectional sofa and you’ve basically created a lounge-like setup that feels like a chaise.
* Mix textures for depth: a leather sectional sofa with a velvet ottoman looks rich and layered, while a faux leather couch next to a boucle bench creates a cozy balance.
* In apartments, a small space sofa with a compact ottoman saves square footage while still offering comfort.

This flexibility makes them an easy upgrade no matter what your main furniture looks like.

# Styling Ideas for Different Tastes

No matter your design preference, there’s an ottoman or bench that fits:

* **Minimalist vibes** → Light shades like beige, cream, or gray pair beautifully with mid century modern furniture.
* **Cozy atmosphere** → Fabrics like boucle, fur, or woven textures bring warmth and softness, especially next to genuine leather sofas.
* **Bold personality** → Jewel tones like emerald, teal, or mustard add instant character and make your ottoman or bench the star of the room.

# Why Every Home Needs One

At the end of the day, ottomans and benches are small pieces with huge impact. They’re easy to move around, fit in tight spaces, and serve more than one purpose—seat, table, footrest, or storage.

Even better, they make a room feel “finished.” A sectional sofa or genuine leather sofa feels more balanced with a stylish ottoman in front. A bedroom feels more polished with a bench at the foot of the bed. And since they’re lightweight, you can rearrange whenever you feel like refreshing your space.

Ottomans and benches may not take up much square footage, but they pack a punch when it comes to style and practicality. Whether you’re decorating a modern apartment with a small space sofa or upgrading a family room with a leather sectional sofa, these little pieces bring flexibility and character into your home.

If you’re browsing for ideas, Mid in Mod offers a wide range of ottomans and benches that are stylish, functional, and perfect for every type of room. Check out their collection—you might just find the small but mighty piece your home is missing.",1,1757516664.0,midinmod,0,1.0,False

The barista is super friendly, probably too friendly for 7:30 a.m. and she asks how my morning’s going.

I panic and say something stupid like, “Just trying to be a real adult today.” She laughs and goes, “Aren’t we all? I moved here last year and still don’t feel like a real adult.” Then she tells me she moved from Ohio.

Now, here’s where I should’ve just said, “Oh, cool!” and moved on with my life. But instead, my brain decides to fill the silence with:  
“Wow, yeah, I don’t think I’ve ever met someone who moved *to* here from Ohio. Usually, it’s the other way around.”

She pauses. Just a beat. Then goes, “Well, I guess I’m the exception.”

I try to recover: “Not that there’s anything wrong with Ohio! I mean, I’ve never been, but I’m sure it’s, flat?”

Why did I say flat?

She just smiles, politely, like someone who’s deciding if she should spit in my coffee (she didn’t, I think). I tip $3 out of guilt and sit in the corner trying to disappear into my laptop.

A few minutes later, she brings over my drink and goes, “Here you go, hope it’s not too flat,” with the sweetest, most passive-aggressive Midwestern smile I’ve ever seen.

I tipped again before leaving. I don't even know why. I basically paid $9 in apology tax.

I caught my husband texting another woman three months ago and threw him out on the street at 2 AM.

Looking back, maybe I overreacted. The texts weren't even that bad. Just some coworker asking about dinner plans and him saying he'd love to go. But I'd been drinking wine with my sister that night, and she kept saying things like ""men are trash"" and ""once a cheater, always a cheater."" So when I saw those messages pop up on his phone while he was in the shower, I lost it.

I screamed at him to get out. Threw his clothes off the balcony. Called him every name I could think of. He kept trying to explain, standing there dripping wet with just a towel, but I wouldn't listen.

""Baby, please, she's just a colleague. We were planning a work dinner with the whole team.""

""Get out! I know what this is. My sister warned me about you.""

The next morning, I posted on Facebook about how I'd finally escaped my ""emotionally abusive"" relationship. Said he was controlling, manipulative, always making me feel small. My friends rallied around me. Commented things like ""you deserve better queen"" and ""good riddance."" My mom called crying, saying she always suspected something was off about him.

Here's where I messed up.

See, what I didn't mention in that post was that I'd been seeing someone else for four months. My personal trainer. It started innocent enough, just coffee after sessions. Then drinks. Then his apartment. I told myself it didn't count because my marriage was already dead. My husband worked long hours, barely noticed me anymore. This trainer, he made me feel alive again.

My husband found out about everything two weeks after I kicked him out. Not sure how. Maybe he hired someone to follow me, maybe a friend saw us together. Doesn't matter. What matters is he had screenshots. Photos. Everything.

He didn't confront me directly. No angry texts or calls. Nothing.

Instead, he waited for our annual Fourth of July family BBQ. Everyone was there. My parents, siblings, cousins, even my elderly grandmother. Kids running around with sparklers. My dad at the grill talking about his new boat. Perfect family gathering.

My husband showed up uninvited. I saw him walking across the lawn and my stomach dropped. Before I could say anything, he connected his phone to the Bluetooth speaker we had set up for music.

""Sorry to interrupt everyone. I just wanted to clear something up.""

Then he played an audio recording. My voice, clear as day, talking to my trainer about my husband. Laughing about how clueless he was. Planning our next meetup while my husband was at work. The whole family went silent. Even the kids stopped playing.

But he wasn't done. He pulled out printed screenshots on poster boards. Like a twisted presentation. My Facebook post calling him abusive, right next to screenshots of me texting the trainer explicit photos. Timestamps showing everything happened before that night I kicked him out.

""I tried to explain about that work dinner. She wouldn't listen. Because she needed an excuse to end things without looking like the bad guy.""

My dad stepped forward. ""Son, this isn't the place.""

""When is the place? When she's telling everyone I'm abusive? When she's playing victim while sleeping around? I loved this woman. Worked myself to death trying to give her everything. And this is what I get?""

He left after that. Just walked back to his car and drove away. The BBQ ended pretty quickly. People made excuses to leave. My mom hasn't answered my calls since. My dad texted once, just said he was ""disappointed."" My siblings think I got what I deserved.

The trainer ghosted me the day after the BBQ. Guess he didn't want the drama.

Now I'm sitting here in this empty house, wondering if I took things too far with that Facebook post. My friends are saying he's psycho for the BBQ stunt, that normal people don't do revenge presentations at family gatherings. But others are saying I destroyed his reputation first, so he just returned the favor.

With how they speak, dress, behave in general.
I'm all for freedom of speech, for people to be true to themselves and do what makes them happy, but when it crosses into rude and uncouth behavior, you have to wonder what the hell has society become?
I'm not saying we shouldn't be able to express ourselves,  but come on....
Getting so drunk you pass out in the gutter or you throw up on the sidewalks.
Clipping your toenails at Starbucks while people are having coffee.
Watching or talking on your phone with no earbuds (don't get me wrong, I appreciate some of the juicy stories I've heard, but I draw the line hearing about Baby Billy's diaper rash and his little butthole being super sore)
Being loud. For. No. Reason. Just straight up loud. 
Instead of calmly talking to someone if there's an issue, it just a huge shouting match.
People doing their little tiktok dances, or videos..not realizing that they are in public and others are around. A lot of us are not interested in any of that and don't want to be part of your filming. (This is all ages)
Whatever happened to just going out, enjoying a nice comfortable quiet meal. Not having people bump into you because they stand on their seats to take a picture of food to show everyone. Not to be accosted by drunk people or hit on, when you've given no indication you're interested. 
Clothes that...just be naked at that point...like I said im cool with expressing oneself, but I don't need to see a tattoo that is on your butt cheek, peaking out from you too high skirt...
My biggest complaint...people who smell.
Yo come on...if you can afford a cup of coffee you can get some deodorant or a bar of soap and wash up. Even a packet of baby wipes. There is absolutely no reason people should stink like that. Idc of you do the whole au natural thing,  you smell. We smell you.
And the opposite side, wearing so much cologne or perfume is like a little shadow that follows you....im glad you want to smell good, but if I'm about to put some type of food or drink something and your cologne goes into my mouth before hand, and that's what I taste, I'm gonna be pissed.

1ndgmwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ResonantRejects/comments/1ndgmwb/evaluate_the_best_wireless_headphones_sony/,Evaluate the Best Wireless Headphones Sony WH-1000XM5 Worth it,"Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones quickly became an integral part of my daily routine from the first use. Before diving into the details, let me say this: these noise-canceling over-ear headphones pack a punch. They’re a strong contender for those seeking a comfortable listening experience that combines cutting-edge features with impressive sound quality.

**Build and Design**  
Straight out of the box, the lightweight construction of these headphones caught my attention. The over-ear design fits snugly without ever feeling overly tight, even after prolonged use. With a sleek plastic finish that doesn’t feel cheap but sturdy, they definitely look and feel high-quality. The collapsible carrying case included is not just an afterthought—it’s slim enough to save space in my bag yet protective enough to avoid worrying about damaging the headphones.  

**Audio Performance**  
The sound? Oh, the sound. I’m no audiophile, but the 30mm dynamic drivers deliver bass so rich and vocals so clear that it’s hard not to bob your head along to your favorite tunes. Supporting Hi-Res Audio takes the listening experience up a notch, making every single note come alive, especially when paired with devices streaming high-quality music. The frequency range of 20Hz to 20kHz ensures that the lows, mids, and highs hit all the right spots.

**Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)**  
If noise cancellation had a gold standard, Sony’s WH-1000XM5 would be in the running. I tested its ANC in various environments: a bustling coffee shop, a crowded subway, and even on a windy balcony. The result? Most of the background chatter, wind noise, and engine hum faded into oblivion, leaving me in what felt like my private acoustic bubble. The dual processors and eight external microphones dedicated to noise cancellation even filter out those awkward midrange sounds that tend to sneak through lesser ANC models.  

[Check Sony WH-1000XM5 price on Amazon.](https://dgshopper.com/p/b0d9kjwdjb/)

**Battery Life**  
Battery performance is another highlight. With ANC turned on, I managed around 30 hours of uninterrupted playback—a figure that matched the advertised specs. On days I forgot to charge them, a quick 3-minute charge gave me an extra three hours of use. The fast-charging capability has saved me more times than I’d like to admit—it’s a small feature that makes a big difference in the real world.  

**Connectivity Options**  
Switching between devices couldn’t be easier, thanks to Google Fast Pair and Microsoft Swift Pair. Connecting to my Android smartphone was a seamless process; I simply brought the headphones close, and they paired instantly. Pairing them with my Windows laptop was similarly frustration-free, with on-screen guidance walking me through every step. The Bluetooth 4.0 connection held steady across devices without random dropouts or lag issues while streaming video.  

**Benefits**  
- Unparalleled noise cancellation with dual processors  
- Lightweight and comfortable design  
- Exceptional sound quality, especially for Hi-Res Audio files  
- Long battery life with useful quick-charging feature  

**Limitations**  
- Premium pricing may put off budget-conscious buyers  
- The included USB-C charging cable is quite short, limiting convenient charging  

**Competing Products**  
When I compared these headphones to others in the market, like Bose's Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 and the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless, the Sony WH-1000XM5 stood out. While Bose offers a sleeker design and comparable ANC performance, the sound quality from the WH-1000XM5 felt more immersive. Sennheiser’s Momentum 4 boasts slightly longer battery life and better support for audiophile-grade codecs, but it lacks the seamless connectivity features Sony provides.  

**Quality for Price**  
While these headphones aren’t the cheapest option on the market, their performance justifies the investment. Think of it as purchasing both a high-end audio solution and peace of mind during noisy commutes or chaotic household environments. For those who value premium sound and noise cancellation, these headphones hit the sweet spot.

It was on accident! I'm stuck inside a comedy movie!

Let's start with ""how I met Ann"".
I met Ann about a month ago through the retirement home where I used to work. I still go back there to volunteer and to entertain by (ballroom/latin) dancing. She started working in the same retirement home as a music therapist/entertainer, so naturally we crossed paths. Because of my dance ""skills"" we ended up dancing together, much to the amusement of the lovely elderly living there.
After that fateful first few times we met, my ex-colleagues kept joking that we'd make a good couple and encouraged me to ask her out, some even were ""sure"" she was into me. I kept brushing it off because I didn't want their nose in my business.
Yesterday, I finally worked up the courage to ask Ann out. To my surprise, she said yes.

Here is the complication, straight out of a romcom. Today Ann comes up to me and tells me Sean had already asked her out for coffee. She accepted it, but she wasn't sure if he meant it as a date. Knowing my brother, I'm almost certain he did. They haven't scheduled it yet, but plan to in a few weeks when er schedule opens up.
For context: Sean went through a really rough breakup a few years ago. His ex had him renovate her house and then dumped him right after. It shattered his trust, and since then he’s only briefly dated one person. So, him asking someone out again is a pretty big step for him.

Now I don't know what to do. On one hand, I genuinely like Ann and would love to see where things go. On one hand, I’d like to go on the date with Ann. I think we’re compatible and I enjoy spending time together, though I am moving about 50 minutes away in two weeks, which could make things tricky. On the other hand, Sean is a genuinely great guy who deserves happiness, and I honestly think he and Ann might click too (they’re both into performing arts, while I’m more in the medical field).
I really don't know what to do, I'm leaning toward stepping aside and calling off the date. I don't want it coming between our brotherly relationship.

1ndgilw,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand_travel/comments/1ndgilw/whew_our_whirlwind_tour_is_over_heres_a/,"Whew! Our whirlwind tour is over! Here's a post-elopement review of our lodgings, meals, and activities for all future travelers.","Holy cows and sheep, we love New Zealand!! There are no sufficient superlatives for the beauty of the country. If you're here though, you probably already know that so I'll just say that if you're on the fence about visiting NZ, get off the fence and just do it! Here's the breakdown of our 10-day elopement and honeymoon. My partner and I are both from the US, so that biases the opinions up front.

**Flights**: We flew Air New Zealand both ways. It was certainly an upgrade from the bog standard flights or discount airlines we're used to in the US. If you book Economy, you get the option to ""bid"" for upgraded seats at a small discount and I highly recommend doing this. Since it was our honeymoon, we bid on premium economy. We got it both ways at an added cost of ~$450 per person per flight. The ""couch"" upgrade would have been much less (~$150-200) and might have even been better if you want to lay down (and are short), but I can't sleep on planes. I watched all 3 LotR movies on the way out. ;) The two meals of plane food were actually super tasty and fresh. The whole experience was actually about as good as I could hope for, which it should be at this price... (Caveat: Customs! Get the NZeTA and NZTD apps, do them well ahead of time for all your travelers, and getting through customs should be a breeze. We got right through.)

**Food**: I'm just going to say it up front, the food was not bad but rarely remarkable. Somewhere between a 5/10 and 8/10 for everything. My favorite food was the Mitai Maori experience in Rotorua. The worst was Oppie's, a takeout place also in Rotorua. Everything else was between those two experiences. Be warned: **""ketchup"" is not ketchup.** It's ""tomato sauce"" and it tastes very different so if you're expecting HFCS-laden ketchup, you won't get it. Also, **you will get funny looks if you just ask for ""coffee""**. Drip coffee is a yankee thing, so get used to tall blacks, lattes, or whatever else you prefer in a smaller cup than you're probably expecting. Still tastes good though. :)

**Weather**: Early September is early Spring in NZ so the temps were cold-mild wherever we went. Jackets are a must at night, pullover fleece during the day was usually fine. Every morning started foggy and muggy but cleared up by lunch, followed by a brief overcast rain, then clear afternoon and cloudy evening. It was like clockwork, anywhere we went.

**Driving**: The left-handed paradigm took a lot of getting used to, ngl. It's mostly fine when you're up and going, but I nearly caused two accidents trying to use the two-laned roundabouts. A bit terrifying, even with some initial practice in a small place like Queenstown. You can't beat the freedom of having your own vehicle. The sticker shock of gas prices will get you, so I recommend a hybrid vehicle. I would *not* advise getting a camper/RV given the gas prices, a lot of roads being pretty narrow, and relatively cheap lodging.

Ok that's the broad stuff. Here's the itinerary:

* Days 1-4 (Queenstown) - Hotel: Holiday Inn was pretty standard lodging but everything was nice. We balked at the continental breakfast (NZ$30 pp, which turned out to be a little less than most hotels) and ate at nearby bakeries for half that or less. (4/5 stars) Activities: Arrowtown walking/hiking, street luge, bird sanctuary, and of course *getting married*. All very highly rated, particularly the elopement package booked with Stoneridge Estates. The only (albeit small) criticism we had of that experience was the ""evening dinner with a personal chef"" at the Estate which was dark and quite long (2.5 hours, 5 courses) and in a tiny room overlooking... the inky blackness of night. Never even met the chef, either. Still, Queenstown was my favorite place. We could have easily spent the whole trip here.

* Day 5: (Drive to Christchurch, stay overnight) - Hotel: Scenic Hotel Cotswold is styled like an olde English Inn and was the most charming place we stayed. (5/5) Activities: hiking the Godley Head Walkway was absolutely magical. The town center shopping is also very charming. Along the way, we also stopped at Lake Tekapo and wish we could have stayed there overnight for some stargazing. Spending so little time in ChCh and in Wellington are my biggest regrets of the whole trip, because they both seem like cool cities.

* Day 6: (Drive to Kaikoura, stay overnight) - Hotel: Sudima Kaikoura was very nice and overlooked the water, otherwise very standard hotel. (4/5). Activities: EcoZip!! This was *awesome*. Can't recommend highly enough. You travel down a series of 5 long ziplines from a nearby hilltop with a pair of friendly guides who explain the local history and some local culture. Really, really, great!

* Day 7: (Drive to Blenheim/Picton, stay overnight) - Hotel: Scenic Hotel Marlborough was a bit of a step down in quality from the rest, but perfectly serviceable for such a small town. (3/5) Ok so here's where we messed up. The Marlborough area is very pretty but I wish we'd just gone straight on to Wellington. Instead, we walked around Blenheim's town square, visiting a little pub, and that's really about all we had the time and energy to do. 

* Day 8: (Ferry to Wellington, stay overnight) - Hotel: Ibis Wellington was probably the smallest room and lowest quality hotel we stayed at. Being in the city, parking was very limited and they upcharged for it so we parked outside on the street overnight. (2/5) Activities: Zealandia wildlife sanctuary, touring the Capital parliamentary building, and watching the All Blacks trounce South Africa from a local bar. All incredible experiences!! I regret that we didn't make time for the National History Museum since it was *right there* but it wasn't meant to be.

* Day 9-10: (Drive to Rotorua, stay overnight) - Hotel: Silver Fern Rotorua Suites & Spa was an interesting take on the standard motel. Sliding patio doors to get in the room didn't feel very secure and let in a lot of light. The layout of the room was odd with a hot tub taking up a lot of floor space, but the room itself was large and the service very friendly. (4/5) Activities: National Kiwi Hatchery, Redwoods Tree Walk, Mitai Maori Village experience, Hobbiton (on the way out to Auckland). Again, all incredible! I'd recommend all of them. Be warned: Rotorua is *smelly* (hot mineral pools nearby constantly belching sulfur and whatever else). Very stinky all the time. The town itself is otherwise very nice and easy to navigate. Hobbiton was an hour away and a great experience not unlike going to Disney World. Enchanting, modern, and a must-stop for any fans of the movies. If you're not a fan of the movies though, I'd skip it due to it being very expensive and quite out of the way from anything else. 

We flew out the same evening as doing Hobbiton and got home super jet lagged. I built in one more day off (today) to try to help with that. Overall I wish we'd spent just 2 more days in NZ, one in ChCh and one in Wellington, but otherwise I feel like we got the full experience we set out for! I hit up this sub a lot for activities, reviews, and opinions so thanks to everyone who posts here. Hopefully this helps someone in the future.",2,1757516312.0,newzealand_travel,1,0.67,False

For a while, I thought it was the kind of opinion you'd mostly see online, but a few years ago my close friends were joking about how ""people with money always want you to pay them back over the smallest shit!"" 

You know what? Yeah! **We do!** I've always been the person ""with money"" in a friend group, and while I don't go around broadcasting it to the world, my friends have subtly made it clear that they think I'm ""bougie"" and can't relate to real financial struggle (they're correct; I'm both a little bougie and have never experienced financial struggle). 

I tried to be the person who could let all the little expenses go; a trip to a cafe? Nah, I've got it, you get me next time. A ticket to the movies? Oh, don't worry about it, it's only $10. 

Well guess how much all those little transactions have cost me in the last two years? All the outings, all those ""iced lattes"" I've covered? All those little ""small things"" that don't really matter? **Over $3,000!** 

And my friends, who I don't mean to disparage, *haven't reciprocated.* They can't, right now, due to financial hardship-- and that's fine, because I never expect to get anything back for money I spend on others, though I sure as hell notice when there're gaps), but every time I hear this stupid ""rich person is too exacting when it comes to small transactions"", I think to myself, ""Yeah, because said rich person has been used as an interest-free bank for those small transactions in the past, and that shit adds up! Pay your share!""

1ndgh6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ndgh6v/gimme_some_ideas_guys/,Gimme some ideas guys,"So I’m 23, and I have been working at this place for like a year(10-11 months). And it’s a cubicle based work environment. My neighbor is this sweet old lady in her late 40s I think. She’s really sweet and we exchange lunches and eat together snd stuff. She knows everything that goes on in my life to the detail and will ask me “Hey OP, how’s grad school doing”, “Hey OP, has your dad recovered from kidney stones yet”. I also know all about her husband and kids, etc. Sweetest lady with the nicest family ever, and she has given me life advice too(unsolicited, but came from a good place). 

Here’s the issue. I don’t know her name 😭

It’s too awkward for me to ask her now since I’ve known her for a long time already. I tried everything. She’s in a different department than me so I’ve never sent her an email. I’m the only guy at my workplace and all the women rarely use each others names(instead resorting to like “babes” or “girl”) and/or nicknames that are inside jokes(that I’m not aware of). I tried taking her and someone else to a coffee shop for lunch once, and offered to pay, but since I paid the barista put my name on all 3 cups since they ordered the same thing as me, and didn’t ask her for her name, so that was a freaking bust too.

Every conversation with her is dreadful cuz I feel like an imposter waiting to be caught 😭 we’re supposed to wear name tags at work but most people ignore that role and she’s one of them. 

The worst part is coming up. Her birthday is next month, and one of her workplace friends invited me to a lowkey surprise party at a restaurant. I do have to bring a gift. That’s not the hard part. I’m not gonna know her name and idk if I can go any longer. I can’t call her by the nickname everyone calls her cuz it’s an inside joke I wasn’t there for, and I’ve NEVER called her that before and if I do it, I’m 100% sure they’ll know I’ve been pretending to know her name. Also, it’s a joke I wasn’t there for and it’s gonna come across rude if I do it(it’s a super rude nickname that is sexually explicit so I don’t wanna say it either). 

I’m gonna be expected to write a card and sing along to a birthday song using her actual name. What do I do, I’m literally in a catch-22 😭",4,1757516223.0,self,1,1.0,False

1ndgfxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEarReviews/comments/1ndgfxg/investigate_if_the_best_countertop_microwave_ge/,Investigate if the best countertop microwave GE PEM31SFSS is worth it,"The GE PEM31SFSS microwave has been in my kitchen for a while now, and it has become one of those appliances I almost can’t do without. Testing it daily has left me with a mix of satisfaction and minor gripes worth mentioning. If you’re considering getting a countertop microwave that fits seamlessly into your kitchen and fulfills most basic demands, this is a great option to look into.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing you'll notice about this microwave is its sleek and modern stainless-steel finish. GE did an excellent job with the design, making it visually appealing and compact enough to blend into almost any kitchen. Measuring 24 x 12.8 x 12.2 inches and weighing around 29 pounds, it fits easily on countertops or can even be built in with an optional trim kit that adds to its versatility. It looks premium, and the simple control panel is straightforward to use. One thing I found practical is the clean aesthetic—it’s really easy to wipe down, and fingerprints don’t stick as much as you might think for a stainless-steel appliance.

**Internal Capacity and Usage**  
This microwave offers 1.1 cubic feet of interior space, enough to accommodate regular plates and medium-sized bowls. While it’s not designed for hefty casserole dishes, it’s perfect for reheating leftovers or cooking smaller meals. The cavity itself measures 17 3/8 x 9 x 12 1/4 inches, which makes it slightly limited in height. If you were planning on microwaving tall mugs or containers, you might find yourself wishing for a bit more vertical space. Still, for everyday needs—whether it's warming coffee, reheating pizza, or steaming vegetables—it handles these tasks effortlessly.  

[Check GE PEM31SFSS price on Amazon.](https://sohdu.com/p/b01c8582y0/)

**Performance and Features**  
With 800 watts of power, the cooking results are pretty consistent and even. The turntable inside ensures that food heats uniformly, which was a noticeable improvement compared to my older microwave that often left cold spots. The power level options are easy to adjust, letting me customize heat settings for different foods—whether defrosting chicken or melting chocolate. The defrost function, in particular, deserves some praise. It’s quick but gentle, and I didn’t end up with partially cooked edges on frozen foods, which is a huge pet peeve of mine. That said, 800 watts isn’t exactly beastly power, so cooking times are slightly longer than you might get with a higher-watt appliance.

**Key Benefits**  
• Sleek and stylish stainless-steel design complements any kitchen.  
• Compact size with the option to be built-in using the trim kit.  
• Even heating results ensured by the turntable.  
• Intuitive controls and adjustable power levels.  

**Disadvantages**  
• The 1.1 cubic feet capacity is somewhat restrictive for larger cookware.  
• 800-watt output means cooking times are slightly longer than in higher-wattage models.  

**Ease of Use and Everyday Cleaning**  
I tested the GE PEM31SFSS during hectic weekday breakfasts and low-key dinner prep, and it's incredibly easy to use. The control buttons are labeled in a way that even my tech-averse parents could figure out with minimal instructions. That being said, I wish it offered a feature like a sensor cooking mode, which is becoming more common in newer models and could elevate the user experience further. On the plus side, it’s a breeze to clean. Spills stayed contained due to the smooth interior, and a simple damp cloth easily tackled dried splatters.

**Competitive Options**  
Looking at its competitors, models like the Panasonic NN-SN686S or the Toshiba EM925A5A also compete in the same category. While Panasonic has the edge with high-powered inverter technology and a slightly larger capacity, the Toshiba model is better suited if budgeting is your main concern. GE’s design and the optional trim kit add a level of adaptability unmatched by either of these, though Panasonic’s advanced cooking features feel more modern compared to GE's more traditional approach. If the built-in feature or a clean aesthetic matters to you, GE wins hands down.

**Value for Money**  
In terms of cost efficiency, the GE PEM31SFSS strikes the right balance between premium design and usability. It may not have groundbreaking features like sensor-based cooking or advanced inverter technology, but it offers solid performance for everyday use. As far as its price-to-quality ratio goes, it justifies the investment if you’re looking for something durable and stylish without diving into fully integrated, high-end kitchen systems.

So my boss asked me to do the descaling process in our company's office Nespresso Pixie. 

I accepted the challenge. Spoiler: I should't have accepted. 

Everything was going fine, the machine was completely clogged, but after some time and some cycling with the descaling liquid from nespresso, the nozzle started to pour a decent amount of liquid. 

I did a couple more cycles with HOT tap water, because in my mind it made sense that it will clean all the deposits better. 

I dont know if the machine stopped working or managed to finished the cycle, in any case, now the machine does not work at all. 

The lights flash but absolutely no sound what so ever of the pump.... I have the impression that the machine continues to heat up properly.

I have exited the descaling mode, restarted it pushing lungo coffee 5 seconds and also unplugged it for some time. 

Yet, nothing. The machine starts, both coffe light turn on but when I press the button, the button flashes (as if it was working) but nothing happens.

Please help. Now nobody in my office has coffee and I am going to earn a bad reputation. 

Any help is welcome.

I thought I had some strange ones, but my buddy's story from last week takes the cake.

He’s been on the job hunt for about four months and applied for a role at a small creative agency known for being a bit eccentric. They emailed him about an interview but were super cagey about the location, only saying it would be somewhere ""unconventional."" He figured it would be an artsy coffee shop or maybe a modern art gallery—something to get the creative juices flowing.

The morning of the interview, the calendar invite updates with a pin dropped right in the middle of the city's big summer fair. He honestly thought it was a prank. He called the hiring manager, and she just laughed and said, ""Nope, that's the spot! See you there."" So, he shows up in a blazer and dress shoes, carrying his laptop bag, feeling like a total weirdo surrounded by families eating cotton candy.

He meets the interviewer, who is standing there holding a couple of tickets for the giant gondola wheel. My friend's jaw just about hit the floor. The guy just smiled and said, ""It's part of our process to see how people roll with the unexpected."" They get into one of the cabins, and right as they get to the very top, with a view of the whole city, the interview officially started.

He said it was, weirdly enough, one of the most relaxed and genuine interviews he's ever had. The interviewer explained that they do this to ditch the stuffy corporate vibe and have a real conversation. They ended up just chatting about their philosophies on creativity and collaboration, laughing at the absurdity of it all, and actually connecting as people.

He finds out if he got the job next week, but he told me he had to share the experience. It’s a wild reminder that the ""right way"" to do things isn't the only way, and sometimes the most memorable moments happen when you're open to something totally out there.",0,1757515600.0,CustomerSuccess,3,0.17,False

I know it’ll never replace what you lost, but it should relieve that aspect of grief. The photo albums are in the top of the closet. You know Sarah loved to scrapbook so any memory you could want should be there. Just know that what I did was not malicious. I did it out of necessity. 

Hilldale Police Department and any other investigators involved: Everything past this point can be considered my confession. I understand if this document cannot be accepted as of sound mind and body so I have also dictated this to my lawyer and he has a notarized copy that should match up. There is no reason for the investigation to continue. My in-laws have no need to be harassed with questions. Let the case close and let them bury their loved ones. 

Monday 7 July

I was awoken from a nightmare filled with gore and violence. At the foot of my bed sat my two children, John (6) and Sally (9). I got out of bed, got them water and put them back to bed. On my way back to my room, I slipped on the floor and hit my head. While in my daze, I was met by a dark figure that handed me a book and explained that I would know what to do with it when the time came. I got myself up and returned to bed. That morning, on my desk at work, sat the same book. Its dark brown leather bindings were unmistakable. The pages were brittle and yellowed with age. As I turned to the first I was hit with an odor of decay and sulphur. The book began “I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals.” I quickly closed it, immediately recognizing its origin. The book went into my bag and I attempted to finish my day. 

That night, I was blessed with another nightmare. In this one the dark figure spoke to me. What I assume were its eyes stared into mine and in a dark ethereal voice it said “2. 23.” Then I awoke. I scrambled for the book. Inside I turned to chapter 2, page 23 and saw what had to be done. I woke Sarah, told her I had gotten a call from work, and left to begin my preparations. 

When I returned later that day, I called everyone into the family room. They sat on the couch and I stood before them with an air of defeat. “Daddy has to do bad things. Don’t worry, everyone will be okay. Trust me.” Sally and John seemed frightened but assured by my fake confidence. Sarah had a look of quiet disgust and fear. She shoved it down to embrace our children. That evening we had a long discussion where I explained to her my visions and I showed her the book. After some argument and hushed yelling she decided that I should seek mental help and gave me a number to call. Instead I went to the priest. After explaining to him what I felt were the important details, he reassured me that a higher power had a plan for me and my family. His words, undoubtedly meant to be comforting, only cemented in my head what I had to do. I went home that night and prepared for the worst. 

Before I go on, I’m sorry. This wasn’t supposed to happen. I’m no one special. Sure I had my dreams and aspirations but then I got married and had kids. I was a normal suburban man with a normal job. I don’t know why I did what I did, except that I had to. That part was clear. 

Wednesday 9 July

I started with Sally. She had always been meek and soft spoken so I knew she wouldn’t put up much of a fight. She was still asleep in her bed, so I stood in her doorway and watched her sleep. My little angel. After two long years of trying and trying, she surprised us as a welcome Christmas gift. That tiny pink blanket made it so that September would never be the same. When we brought her home she was no bigger than my forearm. The long nights and endless diapers formed the princess that slept so peacefully wrapped in her big kid blanket that we got her when she went to kindergarten. That long beautiful brown hair that her mother meticulously brushed every morning became a dark mess as my hammer connected with the cowlick. Strike after strike with such fury that my face quickly became painted by the tiny red drops of matter that escaped. She didn’t even have a chance to fight. Before either of us knew what happened, she had lost all grip on her teddy bear and slumped into her mattress. I wiped the tears and blood from my face and moved down the hallway. 

As I stood outside John’s door, collecting my breath and calming my quivering emotions, I heard some motion inside. I cracked the door, silhouetting myself with the hallway light. “Daddy, what’s going on?” A tiny voice emerged from the shadows. 

“It’s okay buddy, just lay back down.”  He relaxed back into his pillow as I closed the door behind me. I was already making too much noise so I had to change my approach. Next to his bed was a stuffed stegosaurus that he got for his birthday. We had visited the Utah museum of natural history and it ignited a love of dinosaurs. He had fallen in love with the giant skeleton on display and when they had the stuffy in the gift shop it was a no brainer. He carried that thing home and didn’t let go of it for days. Steggy ate dinner with us, he went on car rides, and he even escorted John to the bathroom during potty training. The love that he had for these prehistoric giants surpassed that of any cartoon or even graham crackers. The plush fake scale texture added a level of grip that allowed it to easily be used to snuff out his young life. As he squirmed under my weight, I could hear him trying to struggle and plead. As he continued yelling “Daddy! Daddy please!” I couldn’t help but break down. When his tiny appendages relaxed and gave in the only sound left was my sobs. I sat on the bed next to him and stroked his hair. I cried so loud that I woke up my wife. 

I raised my head to walk out and Sarah’s eyes met mine in the doorway. The shock and horror on her face ignited a rage in me that I’ve never felt before. She knew what I was doing. She knew why I was doing it. She wasn’t supposed to be involved and now she stood there judging me. I lunged at her and pinned her to the ground. Blow after blow my balled fists connected with her face until it became an unrecognizable pile of hamburger. When she quit fighting, I stood up and cleaned the blood off my hands. As I looked at the bruises and developing defensive wounds from her perfectly manicured nails, I had a realization sweep over me. The things I had done were all in service of a mission, but Sarah was innocent. After cleaning myself to a point of acceptability I ran. 

I hopped in the car and wound up at my dad’s. I walked in as he was finishing his cup of coffee before continuing with his morning routine. My physical condition understandably shocked him and he brought me inside. After assuring him that I was fine I broke down in tears and explained the whole ordeal. He was dumbfounded. The first thing he did was call the police, report the crime at my house, and then he came to me and started working over a strategy. As an old defense attorney himself, he connected me with one of his old colleagues who rushed to the house expecting a bourbon and cigar on the porch. When he arrived my dad paid him and he went to work recording this information and arranging my documents. As he left, my father ushered me upstairs and got me into a shower. Once I was cleaned and changed, he urged me to step into the guest room where I am now writing this letter from. 

I don’t know if I can say it enough, but I am sorry. I only did what I had to. I love my family. I will undoubtedly pay for my actions, but I rest easy knowing that I have lived my life and performed all actions according to his plan and his will. 

Dad: I apologize for the mess. I know you’ll find this letter before the police do, but please return it to where you found it and let them do their work. Thank you for everything you have done for me. Know that you had no part in this. I love you and I always have. I’m sorry for everything. 

This letter was found near the body of Mr. Caleb Whitmore following a Hilldale Police response to a shots fired call from outside the home. The individual was located in the guest room of his father’s house surrounded by photos of his children and wife, who were discovered earlier that day massacred in their home. Mr. Whitmore apparently suffered from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Following an in depth investigation by the Utah Bureau of Investigations, the community continues to reel in the wake of this indescribable tragedy.”

1ndg3c4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1ndg3c4/explore_the_best_liquid_detergent_tide_offers_and/,Explore the Best Liquid Detergent Tide Offers and See If It Lives Up,"The Tide Simply Clean & Fresh Liquid Laundry Detergent, Berry Blossom scent, caught my attention as a person who does multiple laundry loads weekly. With its promise to handle 99% of common stains and odors, it sounded like the ideal choice for tackling everything from my gym clothes to those accidental spaghetti sauce stains on my kid's uniforms. Here's how it fared in real-life use.  

**Performance: Does It Clean as Promised?**  
As someone who seemingly attracts coffee spills and grass stains, I was curious how well this detergent would handle different challenges. True to its claim, it stood up to its 99% stain elimination promise. Whether I was dealing with stubborn food marks, sweaty gym wear, or dirt from outdoor activities, the results were consistently impressive. The concentrated formula seemed to pack a punch, needing only a small amount to thoroughly clean clothes. The laundry came out not just clean but also fresh-smelling, thanks to the berry blossom scent, which added a fun twist.  

**Convenience and Effectiveness:**  
One feature I didn’t expect to fully appreciate was the 2X power of baking soda in every dose. This wasn't just marketing fluff; it genuinely felt like it tackled odors before I even added fabric softener. My older towels, which typically have a musty smell, came out refreshed, indicating the detergent’s efficiency in eliminating deep-seated odors. The detergent also claims to work efficiently in all machine types, and in my HE machine, it didn’t clog or leave any residue—always a win for me.  

[Ready to snag Tide Simply Clean & Fresh Liquid Laundry Detergent? Check Amazon pricing here.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b0cptcynzd/)  

**Aroma: A Scent to Remember**  
Berry Blossom, the advertised fragrance, is definitely distinct from many other detergents I’ve used. It has a light, fruity aroma that lingers just enough after washing but isn’t overpowering. As someone who's sensitive to overly strong scents, I found it pleasant. The kids even commented that their clothes “smelled like happiness,” so it seems to be kid-approved, too.  

**Pluses**  
- Lightweight, fruity Berry Blossom scent without feeling overly artificial  
- Designed to fight 99% of stains, which it did with ease  
- Suitable for all washing machines and water conditions  
- Concentrated formula means less product needed per wash  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The packaging could include a better measuring cap; it's easy to overuse without gauging correctly  
- The scent, while pleasant, may not suit those preferring unscented detergents  

**Competing Products**  
When stacked against similar detergents like Arm & Hammer Plus OxiClean or the Purex range, this detergent holds its own in terms of stain removal and scent longevity. However, it lacks the wider variety of fragrances some competitors offer. Arm & Hammer excels with its stain-fighting enzymes but occasionally falls short on odor elimination for items like gym wear. Purex, while budget-friendly, doesn't provide the same lasting scent. If you’re after cleaning power and a fresh, light fragrance, Tide Simply Clean & Fresh feels like a middle ground between effectiveness and appeal.  

**Price Performance**  
Laundry detergents can weigh on the monthly household budget, so finding a reliable one at a fair price is essential. While I won’t go into specific pricing (who knows what discounts may pop up), the concentrated formula here ensures you're using less per load, which enhances its cost-effectiveness over time. Not having to rewash or use additional boosters means more value out of each bottle. It’s a sensible option for anyone managing cleaning challenges and looking to save over the long term.

OK gang, this is important. Also, I'm definitely ND so I hope ya don't mind my just launching in! 
I just learnt Brennan's coming to Australia (or is already here? Unsure) with plans to go to Naarm*/Melbourne. There's this place on Grey Street in St Kilda that does fuckin beautiful pizzas and I reckon our favoured DM can't pass through the area without getting himself one! The place is called 'Holy Trinity Pizza', so named because the legend running the joint stonebakes, woodsmokes and then takes a torch to the pizzas for the final touch. There are only 2 pizzas on the menu - a meat lovers and one that's got veg & olives. Unfortunately I can't remember the names of the pizzas, I just know they're fucking good - all my Italian friends who've been there have said ""it's the closest [they] could find to pizza back home, in Australia."" And it's only about ~$15AUD!
Fun fact about Grey Street: it used to be the Red Light District for Naarm back in the day. It has a distinct kinda vibe that I reckon Brennan might like.
Ah, there's also a cafe there, in the Roamer Hostel (same street), called The Bearded Jaffle. Cheapest coffees in Melbourne - $5 for a large, regardless of what milk ya want - and the quality! Beautiful stuff.

Just occurred to me to put this out there, kinda my way of giving back, as I've really gained so much over the years from the energies he's been putting out over the internet's

As someone who has battled stubborn bathroom stains more often than I’d like to admit, finding a toilet cleaner that actually delivers on its bold claims is practically a quest. After extensive use, both at home and in some ridiculous test scenarios (trust me, spilling coffee in a toilet for science isn't glamorous), I’ve got plenty to share about this foaming cleaner.

**Design and Ease of Use**  
The pouches are ridiculously simple to use, coming in conveniently sized packs that don’t feel like you’re storing an unnecessary amount of product. Each packet is lightweight and compact enough to be treated as a bathroom staple without taking up prime cabinet real estate. Pouring the powder into the toilet bowl feels more like a satisfying start to a DIY experiment than a chore, especially since the foam bubbles into action almost immediately. Watching the millions of bubbles rapidly change colors? Weirdly captivating. It’s like babysitting a science project, only it magically cleans while you're mesmerized.

[Check Scrubbing Bubbles 380992 price on Amazon.](https://check.sanue.com/p/b0dbm5qvkv/)

**How It Handles the Dirty Work**  
This cleaner shines when it comes to fighting some of the worst offenders in bathroom maintenance. It took care of limescale, an irritating bane of my polished toilet dreams, with the kind of unbothered grace that made me wonder why other cleaners have failed me. The foam clings to the bowl aggressively enough to cover all surfaces, yet it somehow doesn’t splash or misbehave. What surprised me most was its ability to loosen stains effortlessly in areas that typically make you groan and dig out a toilet brush. Hard water marks? Gone. A stubborn faint coffee splash from that earlier test? Evaporated like it never happened.

**Favorable Aspects**  
Several advantages caught my attention during testing:  
- The foam that changes colors doubles as both entertainment and a visual indicator that the product is actively working.  
- A burst of freshness lingers after using it, which did wonders toward making the bathroom feel less like a utility space and more like a mini spa.  
- Using 60% less plastic compared to traditional liquid toilet bowl cleaners speaks to its eco-friendly consideration.  
- The compact pouches make them practical for quick storage and don’t crowd bathroom counters.  

**What's the Catch?**  
Like any product, this toilet cleaning marvel isn’t without a few obstacles.  
- Depending on your toilet bowl design, the foam doesn’t always distribute evenly in some nooks, although a quick swirling helped.  
- For really tough, ingrained stains, you’ll still need a brush to play sidekick. The cleaner helps loosen grime, but it’s not a magic wand.  
- If you’re sensitive to scents, the burst of freshness might occasionally come across as a little too robust.  

**Competing Options**  
Naturally, I didn’t let Scrubbing Bubbles 380992 off the hook till I compared it with two other popular toilet cleaners. A long-time favorite of mine has been traditional liquid gel cleaners, but their annoying plastic flasks feel wasteful and don’t cling as efficiently to the walls. Meanwhile, fizzing tablets from another brand seemed exciting in theory but lacked the action-packed bubbling power present here. Scrubbing Bubbles’ standout feature is its immediate foam-and-color transformation, coupled with the delightful sense that it’s working relentlessly beneath the surface. Sure, it needs slight assistance for deeply ingrained messes, but the eco-conscious design and visual engagement easily elevate it above competitors.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Buying eco-friendly products often has an unspoken fine print of costing more, but this cleaner finds a sweet spot between impact and affordability. The reduced plastic usage balances its environmental conscientiousness, and the pack-per-clean ratio seems carefully curated so there isn’t too much wastage. Compared to pricier toilet cleaning tools that don’t even handle stains this well, the product feels like a budget-friendly luxury I can justify stocking up on without guilt.

We get it—choosing the right portable espresso maker can be tricky. You want something that fits your lifestyle, doesn’t break the bank, and most importantly, makes great coffee. So how does the OutIn Nano compare to the well-known Wacaco Pixapresso? Both are awesome machines, but they cater to slightly different needs. Let's break it down for your daily grind.

We've rated some key categories on a 5-star scale to make the comparison snap into focus.

The Verdict:

* Choose the Pixapresso if you're a tinkerer who loves to tweak pre-infusion and temperature for the perfect, customized shot. It's a fantastic portable lab.
* Choose the OutIn Nano if you value minimalist design, ultimate simplicity, and durability. Its waterproofing and one-button operation make it the true ""grab-and-go"" champion for adventures.

What do you think? Does a simple, rugged machine fit your lifestyle, or do you need all the adjustable settings? What's your top feature of a portable maker?

I was cleaning the sandwich station when that dreaded doorbell rang again. I really hoped it ain't one of those annoying drama queen aunties of the apartment building opposite to us. Surprisingly, it was a teenage little drama queen that came up to the counter, ordered a Frappuccino for her highness and took up a seat in the corner of the cafe.

How could I tell she was a teenager you ask? Cause I could tell you more about her phone's back cover than I could tell about her face. Okay okay, but how could I tell she was a drama queen? Well, cause I could also tell you how tightly she was gripping her phone. How furiously she was typing on that screen, little digital bullets meant to demolish her opponents with each character or emoji, whatever her preference. Oh, you just know that her whole world was in the dimensions of 2.5 inch by 4.5 inch. A bit too small for her huge personality maybe.

As I went on making the coffee she ordered, she continued making faces and hand signs on the camera. The grip was still just as tight, and why shouldn't it be? I would probably grip my world just as tightly if it fitted so neatly in my hand. A ding sounded on her phone and her whole expression shifted. Trouble in paradise for her highness it seemed as she prepared her perfectly manicured arsenal of ten weapons. Oh this was going to be war. Alas, I could not be there in the making of history as the other barista came in and relieved me. ""What were you looking at?"", she asked. ""Oh nothing, be careful with Ms. Frappuccino over there, it's a small small world.""",1,1757514647.0,u_Additional-Reach-805,0,1.0,False

My kid is turning 1 soon and I want people (family, friends) to write notes to them in a book so that when they turn 18, we give them the book that they can have to read what their parents’ village wanted to say to them but also is a decent book to have on display if they’d like. I’m thinking more of a coffee table book so that it has bigger pages to write in and aesthetically pleasing pictures. I’m also considering having the book out for every birthday leading up to their 18th, but might just keep it at the first year.

My husband and I did something similar for our wedding guest book. Instead of a blank notebook, I found an Ansel Adams National Park book that people wrote in and it sits on a shelf in our living room and we open it now and then to (sometimes laugh) at what our loved ones wrote while looking at Ansel’s pretty picture of our national parks.

What suggestions does the group have? I’m also going to visit local bookstores to peruse the shelves and see what inspires me but thought I’d ask here. ",2,1757514613.0,suggestmeabook,4,1.0,False

IS THIS REAL LIFE?","Guys… Are we living in a simulation? Because I just found out about something and I am absolutely SHOOK. 

*Did you know there are companies—like, LEGIT big-name companies—screaming for mobile app testers in 2025?*  
And—brace yourselves—it’s remote AND flexible. That means pajama pants, coffee on the couch, reviewing new apps, and ACTUALLY getting paid for it. 

I’M FREAKING OUT: Why didn’t anyone tell me this was even a *thing*?! I always thought you had to be some elite coder to get this stuff. Turns out, you just need a phone and opinions. (Big YES on that last part.)

So, I did some deep, possibly obsessive late-night scrolling and compiled these shocker companies you need to check out RIGHT NOW:

- Google (yes, the Google!?)
- Apple (stop it, I thought this was fake)
- UserTesting 
- TestIO
- Appen
- PlaytestCloud 
- Recharge Digital
- Testbirds
- uTest 
- GoodNovel (maybe you saw it coming but **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** literally blew my mind—testing stories as they develop!! Mind=blown.)

What’s even crazier? THEY WANT REMOTE. They want people literally anywhere, with flexible schedules. Which basically means you could be at a coffee shop, in your bed, or chilling at the beach while you’re poking around new apps.

If you think this is just damp LinkedIn hype—listen, I was as skeptical as you! But when I saw how **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** describes their open tester roles (SERIOUSLY GO LOOK), it’s 1000% real. People are posting reviews, earning, and (I kid you not) some apps will send you SWAG or even devices to test. Who even started this universe hack?

There are rumors these roles are going to explode even more in 2025, as more companies compete globally for regular humans to test the next social, productivity, or AI-powered app. Like, “Hey, Jenny from Smalltown, USA, please tell us if you hate this new emoji function so we don’t roll it out to 100 million people!”

CRIPES, this feels illegal to be this fun and this easy.

Pro tip: most of these companies want first impressions, simple feedback, maybe a recording, and NO—you do not need tech wizard skills. If it’s your first time, apply to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and a couple of the others. Just… YES.

Bullet points don’t even serve the chaos I’m feeling right now:

- Get paid to use your phone.  
- Try unreleased apps FIRST.  
- Set your own hours.  
- No degree needed.

Am I dreaming? Somebody slap me. Or at least comment if you’ve tried any of these—I need to know if this is the world now. Because, wow, the next time someone says “This job doesn’t even feel real,” show them **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and WATCH their face. (Yes, that’s FOUR times. Told you this was wild.)

But here I am, $100 richer, basically from…well, pressing buttons on my phone?!

At first I thought it was a total scam. You know the vibe—those cheesy “make $500 in your sleep” popups. But curiosity (and my micro bank account) got the better of me, so I started digging. And OH BOY I’m so happy I did!

Here’s the step-by-step breakdown—a journey into app testing land:

- **First, I signed up here: [https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**
- RNG? Nah, these were real apps and actual cash payouts
- Setup was… laughably simple. Email, tap, done
- The lineup? Some games, some survey-style deals, a funky budgeting app I still might use

The process:

- Download the assigned app  
- Play around with it for at least 10-30 minutes
- Give super basic feedback (like, “that button is weirdly purple?”)
- Repeat for a handful more

It felt so casual I actually forgot I was “working”—literally just chilling, half-watching Netflix with my phone in pillow-fort mode. No “boss,” no schedules, no stress. I earned anywhere from $2 to $12 PER TEST. My Venmo balance actually JUMPED before my coffee even kicked in. Am I dreaming?

**The best part? I kept coming back to [https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** to see what’s new and ended up racking up a hundred bucks without even trying.

Let me hit you with the STRAIGHT FACTS:

- NO subscription fees  
- NO weird surveys about car insurance in Mongolia  
- If you can use a phone, you can do this  
- **All you need is [https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** and ten spare minutes

Now for the confession: at first, I was SUSPICIOUSLY skeptical. I read reviews, Googled complaints, even watched a dude on Youtube talk about payout proof (which, tbh, looked fake... but nope, totally real).

Honestly, my advice is—if you’ve got downtime or want extra latte money, you cannot lose by trying **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** just ONCE.

Like a lot of people, I picked up a new hobby during COVID. My initial goal was simple: to make a song. And I wanted to make my own beat for it first. The funny thing is, I got so hooked on producing in FL Studio that I never even started writing the actual song.

I still remember all the terrible beats I made, but I stuck with it. I don't necessarily consider myself a pro now, but after making hundreds of beats, I've at least got some experience and know what creators need. I used to focus solely on drill & melodic rap, but now I mainly create samples with my guitar (still learning). You can check out some of my old youtube stuff here: [`https://www.youtube.com/@caehdo8468`](https://www.youtube.com/@caehdo8468)

My day job is as a software developer, so I decided to combine my skills and passion to build something I wish I had from day one: a platform that’s affordable (100% free right now), has everything a creator needs in one place, and is built simply because I just enjoy making things.

That’s why my friends and I have been pouring our time into [**Untitledwav.com**](https://www.untitledwav.com/)

. We're ambitious, and our goal is to build the ultimate **one-stop shop** for music creators.

**Our Full Vision For The Near Future:**

* **The Ultimate Sound Library:** This is the foundation. It’s a place to share your own sounds and discover unique loops from other creators. By uploading your work, you can get paid from our creator payout pool—**visit the site to** [**learn more**](https://www.untitledwav.com/welcome) **about how it works!** It's not just user uploads either; our A&R team will be constantly working to bring in exclusive, high-quality sample packs from industry professionals to give you a curated, pro-level library.
* **A Seamless Beat Store:** We're building a fully integrated marketplace for you to sell your beats. You'll be able to manage your catalog, set your prices, and connect with artists right here.
* **A Thriving Community Hub:** This is more than just a forum. It’ll be a place to post your tracks for feedback, find collaborators, read articles on tips and tricks, learn about the best new VSTs, and (we hope!) get exclusive discount codes. A real space to learn and grow.

**Why It's FREE (for now):** Right now, the **sample sharing** feature is live, with drum kits coming very soon. We're keeping everything 100% free because a community platform is nothing without its community. We need you – real creators – to upload your sounds, download others, and, yes, even break things! Your feedback is gold, and it helps us build this thing right.

**What's Next on the Roadmap?** After drum kits, we're going full-steam ahead on the beat store and the community hub. The other big feature my friends and I are really excited about is an **AI-powered sample discovery tool**. Imagine going beyond simple tags and being able to search for ""Old school vocal sample in the style of BigXthaPlug"" That's the future we're building.

**We need your help to build this vision!**

* **Check out the platform:** [`https://www.untitledwav.com/`](https://www.untitledwav.com/)
* **Upload your samples:** Be one of the first to contribute to the library.
* **Download and experiment:** Find some new inspiration for your next track.
* **Give us feedback:** Seriously, tell us what you love, what you hate, and what you want to see! You will be able to provide feedback through the site. Click the coffee mug at the bottom right of the page to leave feedback.

This is a passion project built by creators for creators. We can't wait to see you there and build this community together. Thanks for reading!

I'm about to open my own French bakery in Chicago (finally chasing the dream 🙃). I’ll be selling croissants, pain au chocolat, and all the buttery goodness you'd expect. I'm super excited... and also kind of freaking out.
I know the first few months are gonna be rough, low foot traffic, unpredictable sales, all the startup costs hitting at once. I’ve budgeted as best I can, but I’m looking for ways to bring in some extra income while the bakery builds up a customer base.
Some quick context:

- I’ve got access to a commercial kitchen

- I’ll be working early mornings and lunchtime mostly

- I can bake like a champ but I’m not a pro in marketing or digital stuff (yet)

- I’m open to literally anything that doesn’t totally burn me out.


Some ideas I’ve been thinking about:

- Selling pastries wholesale to local coffee shops or offices

- Doing pastry boxes for pre-orders or events

- Running small baking classes in the evenings 

- Renting out kitchen space during my off-hours",2,1757514169.0,small_business_ideas,5,1.0,False

Well, welcome to my pitch and of course— guide to the Zero Stimulation Day. I shall walk you through the rituals & traditions. I’m having this today and it’s going beautifully.

✦────────── ✦

Day Prior:

Inform your friends, loved ones. Those that live with you (my partner in this instance) that you shall be having a zero stimulation day (or two, that is the beauty of this tradition, your rules.) and you shall be unavailable for *insert amount of business days here* & announce this shamelessly. 

✦────────── ✦
Day of the zero stimulation day, these are the loose rules that you are free to bend to your rule should you so choose.

• Claim a space with a door. A bedroom for example. Make it clear you shall not be coming out for anything other than snacks (though these should be placed in your chosen room in advance for the zero stimulation gods to be pleased fully) or bodily functions such as shiddin n fardin, water & meals. (Noise cancelling headphones are recommended during these activities to convey optimal levels of don’t fkin talk to me but this is not mandatory)

• Have a nice lil iced coffee or favourite beverage at the ready within claimed space.

• Turn phone off if you wish but if not avoid social media ((Reddit doesn’t count shhh)) do not reply to people ((emergencies will be considered for exemption)) and only use phone to engage in content such as your favourite interests and ideally something where capitalism can’t yell at you to buy something with an advert. 

• Wear the Zero Stimulation uniform at all times. Your ugliest and comfiest clothing is required and is mandatory. Get your Pokémon oodie out, get your baggy shirt that looks like it’s been dragged through a hedge but the texture of it is so good and comfy that you cannot resist. PUT. IT. ON. 

• Engage in your hobbies and favourite things on your own such as video games? Movies? Writing this stuff on Reddit? Lie down quietly. Listen to music. ALL DAY!

• And FINALLY! You shall have no shame for the zero stimulation day holiday. You shall remember nobody hates you for doing this, you don’t have to show up today. Be. Shameless.

✦────────── ✦

With this guide, this manifesto or whatever you wish to call it. Go forth, soldier. Feel your brain reset. Cry if your socks are weird. Offer sacrifices of your old socks to the Zero Stimulation gods if you like. Revel in your unapologetic, blissfully uneventful glory.

**Alice** is a college student from Seattle, currently on a journey of self-discovery.

Her dry humor and love for cold coffee and leftover pizza mask a vulnerability that only surfaces when she secretly writes songs or talks to herself in the rain.

**Alice** embodies the spirit of 90s alternative culture and the essence of rebellious authenticity.

   I need someone to see this and believe me.  I have called the police multiple times, and I have had friends check it out with me, but no one will or can do anything about it.  Not now.  I’m at the end of my rope, and I just need to know it’ll all be ok.  Let me explain my situation as clearly as possible, and then perhaps someone can help me before it's too late.

I live just on the cusp of the Appalachian rainforest.  Like anyone lucky enough to live so close to a natural wonder, I go on weekends to camp and smoke in the forest.  After a long week of working a soul-crushing remote job doing nothing all week, the forest has been a haven for me to recharge.  This has been a part of my routine for several years now.  I go to the same abandoned campsite and stay overnight, cooking while high and loving every second I am away from it all.  I knew this spot intimately.  I knew where to get the best view, the best spot for my fire, the perfect patch of soft foliage for my sleeping bag, everything.  Never in all my years visiting this site did I notice anything peculiar or out of the ordinary, until earlier this month.  

After enjoying several rounds of campfire hot dogs and generous amounts of weed, I decided to stand on the scenic cliffside and enjoy the evening breeze.  High as a kite, like the loser I am, I stood on the precipice of the cliff, feeling the wind on my face.  When I turned around, I almost jolted right off the cliff.  Just outside the light of my fire, poking out of the treeline, was a doorway.  Its silhouette jutting out of a bush, it faced me.  

I stood petrified, convincing myself for several moments that I was high and could just be seeing things.  Bracing myself, I slowly approached the campfire, hoping that the more I stared at it, the quicker it would disperse, a simple illusion of the light on my inebriated mind.  It did not.  Fully protected in the warmth of the bonfire, I stood waiting.  For what, I have no idea.  Perhaps I hoped it would leave as easily as it came.  My anxiety, fueled by weed, began to blur my head with a suffocating dread.  

Several more minutes passed before I finally decided to investigate.  I pulled out my LED flashlight from my camping supplies and forced my feet to approach the pair of doors protruding from the bush.  The forest darkness enveloped it until I flicked my light on.  Fully exposed, I examined it from multiple feet away.  

It looked like a closet door.  The pair of simple oak doors was coated in a clean layer of white paint, unmarred by the surrounding forest.  The doorframe itself, also a white trim, twinkled with the 2 sets of bronze door hinges, pristine as the day they were made.  

The modest design was unsettlingly modern for a mountain range riddled with the bones of century-old settlements, many I passed on my weekly adventure.  An anxiety that was impossible to pin down ravaged me as I begged my body to sober up quickly.  Instead, my curiosity took over.  Rationally now, I understand that, at that moment, there was nothing inherently menacing about a pair of doors in the woods.  But if I knew then what I do now, then I never would have gone near them. 

I stepped closer, light fixated on the closet, fully expecting a beast to jump screeching out of it like some childhood nightmare.  However, only the crunch of leaves under my boots echoed through the wood, even as I placed my hand on the knob.  With a smooth click, I turned the knob, and gracefully the left door opened, without a sound.  Nothing but the treeline greeted me on the other side.  

The relief was a high in and of itself.  The tension calmed as I caught my breath.  Fear dispelled, curiosity was all that remained.  Like a dolt, I played archaeologist and spent the rest of the night examining every inch of the closet.  The bizarre appearance still tainted my mood with a sense of foreboding that I couldn't shake, but it didn't stop me from running my fingers all along the doors and trim, trying to find any sign of weathering.  Still, no signs of age, let alone deterioration.  

Fully analyzed, or as well as it could be considering my current state of mind, I snuggly packed myself away into my sleeping bag, ensuring the fire was fed enough to last a couple more hours without me.  I lay, facing the closet, its presence prodding out of the bushes.  Needless to say, it took me a while to fall asleep.  It stood stoically, its mint condition paint revealed by the crackling campfire.  Sleep came, along with a sober mind that reassured me that my horrible habit wholly caused my paranoia.  It definitely was a wake-up call to reexamine my smoking.  

In the morning, I blurrily stumbled about packing my campsite, the lack of sleep weighing me down.  It stood all the while, completely revealed in the daylight.  Its immaculate condition was vibrant and visible.  With a final glance, I looked it over before shaking my head in disbelief and beginning my journey home.  Another week came and went, work hazing by and chores done here and there, and then, the weekend returned.  

After a hesitant decision, I decided I wasn’t going to let last week's abnormal visitor keep me away from my relaxing routine.  The drive to the mountain trail was… tense.  That foreboding had remained nestled in my mind, waiting for this moment to come, and it returned loudly to the forefront of my thoughts.  Reaching the parking lot, just below the trail, I took a deep breath and put the car in park, trying to will my anxiety away as a childish notion.  Unloading my pack, I began up to my hidden campsite; it was still early afternoon.  As I made my way up, I took my usual turn off-trail when I almost lunged backward.  My heart punched my ribcage as I regained my balance.  The closet was standing in the middle of the path.  

I stared at it, disbelief painting my face.  It was the very same one.  Same coat of white paint, same bronze hinges, same trim and doors.  As polished and clean as the first night I saw it.  I stepped closer to feel it, the familiar grooves confirming this was, for certain, the same closet.  Walking around it gave me no answers; there were no signs of drag marks, no footsteps indicating it had been carried.  No evidence for how it got here.  With what little curiosity I had left, I reached gingerly for the doorknob.  An attempted twist was met with firm resistance.  The closet was now locked.  A cold sweat broke over me as I twisted the handle desperately, shaking the door with each try.  

Firmly, it remained locked.  I can’t describe the reasoning; all I know is that this filled me with a coldness I couldn’t shake.  My sweaty palm released the knob, heart aching as it continued racing.  I didn’t want to be there anymore.  Even though my camp was another mile away from it, I didn’t want to be in the woods anymore.  I tore back down the trail, head aching with a palpitating fear.    

Throwing my pack into my car, I drove home.  Almost an entire day down the drain, this would have irked me under normal circumstances.  Instead, I sped home with the desire to lock myself away and spend the remainder of the night binge-watching TV.  I ached for distraction as I pulled into my driveway.  Immediately, I tossed my pack onto the floor and pulled out a bottle of vodka from the freezer.  Drinking and TV, that was the cure I needed, the relief from this underlying nervousness.  

Hungover the next day, I decided to plan a different type of trip the following weekend.  I called a friend, inviting them out for a quick camp session.  My friend Vince was free.  I told him all about the closet and planned on showing him as well.  Talking it over eased a lot of my worries; the presence of someone genuinely interested in seeing it deterred most of the more menacing aspects of the situation. 

Distracted most of the work week, I pressed into another weekend.  A rekindled anxiety gripped me.  Picking up Vince and joking through the car ride helped immensely, but it remained burrowed in the back of my mind.   We pulled up and, after grabbing all our gear, began the trudge up to my secret spot.  Vince distracted me with observations on the natural beauty of the forest and exclamations about how excited he was to finally see not only my hidden campsite, but a mysterious anomaly he joked was straight out of an *X Files* episode.

Fully expecting to run into the closet on the way up, I was shocked to reach the campsite without spotting it.  Vince shared his disappointment that I tried to feign in response, but the relief flowing through my system was obvious.  So, an uneventful good time filled the night, then, after the most restful night I had had all week, I woke to a gorgeous dawn.  With a taste of relief still in my mouth, I packed up the site, letting Vince sleep in a bit as a sign of gratitude.  When he woke, we pulled on our gear and laughed our way down the mountain.  The drive was pleasant, crisp morning air filling the car.  With a huge thank you, I dropped Vince off and resumed my drive home.  The veins of the Applaichan forest trail along the highway basically up to my doorstep, which I peacefully glanced at as I finished the last portion of my journey, when something caught my eye.  Breaks in the treeline I drove by showed glimmers of it as I slowed down.  A rising nervousness spilled from my stomach as I pulled to the side of the road.  

Shakily, I stepped out of my car and gazed down into the forest several yards away, trying to find another breakage I could see through.  A gap between a huddle of trees guided my eyes into the clearing just past them.  There it stood.  The shadows of the wood were incapable of hiding the white of the closet.  It sat squarely facing me.  My breath caught in my throat as I peered at it. 

Even from that distance, I could see.  One of the doors was cracked open.  Fists clenched, I stood frozen, enraptured by its foreboding presence.  A minute or so passed.  Then, the door shut.  I bolted to my car and tore down the highway, desperate for the safety of my home. 

The urge to call some form of law enforcement, or maybe the local rangers of the trails, filled my head as I began to spiral.  I needed answers, I wanted security.  I never wanted to see those closet doors again.  I could barely look at my own anymore.  Every night, I stared down the foot of my bed at them, expecting them to congeal and morph into the pair from the woods. My otherwise plain oak closet stood innocently as my mind played tricks on me.  Did the doors just turn white? Were my hinges turning bronze?  No, they stood, their plain oak held in place with metal hinges.  

I have been sleeping on my living room couch for a couple of nights now.  No matter how childish I felt, I just couldn’t stop psyching myself out.  Working from home helped in the sense that I didn’t spend every morning driving while in a state of borderline hallucination, expecting the closet to appear in my rearview mirror.  My fridge was stocked too, but I knew I could only go a couple more days, pushing off going outside.  

Finally, the day came when I had to step out.  Like an idiot, I pushed it off so last-minute that it was well into the evening when I decided I couldn’t survive off a dwindling supply of snack foods anymore.  I spent several minutes in front of my door, desperately trying to numb my nerves by ridiculing my pathetic behavior.  With a forced speed, I opened my door and marched willfully to my car.  My eyes remained fixed on my car; no glances into the nearby treeline were allowed.  Slamming shut into the safety of my car allowed a moment of relief as I buckled in and drove down the driveway.  

I deeply resented my local grocery store for being in the direction of the mountain trail, but I pressed on, eyes glued to the road.  I got my supplies and began my journey home without a hitch.  I could breathe easier as I turned down the familiar side roads back onto the highway, forest cusping all sides of me still.  I passed the last sighting of the closet, and with newfound courage, I dared a passing glance as I zipped down the highway.  I recognized the breaks in the treeline, but there was no closet to be seen.  No white monolith staring back at me.  

I finished the drive with high spirits, listening to music on an otherwise solemn drive.  I turned back into my neighborhood, enjoying the blur of green trees caught in my headlights as I slowed.  A blob of white interrupted the passing emerald colors.  I slammed on my brakes, bags of groceries spilling in my backseat.  

The night around me began to feel suffocating, blackness surrounding my car.  Stomach aching with the rising bile of fear, I glanced in my rearview.  My red brake lights illuminated the daunting closet, just barely visible behind a pair of withered trees.  It’s bronze hinges glinting in the crimson light, door cracked open.  I stared, too afraid to blink as I shivered in my car, throat choking down the quivering horror my stomach demanded to release.  I saw it in the closet; my eyes stung.  A hand was gripping the side of the left door from inside.  Just as I registered it, it pulled quickly back inside, slamming the closet shut.  

A panic polluted my lungs, and I slammed on the gas.  Pulling into my driveway, nearly crashing into my home, I ran inside and began to dial 911.  I was in hysterics, I’m surprised the cops even showed up, considering my raspy voice gagging for air between sentences.  My shaking remained when they pulled in fourty minutes later, and continued as I pointed in the general direction I saw the closet in the woods.  I told them a man was following me, hoping that would spark more determination in the officers scanning the scattered veins of forest around the neighborhood’s entrance.  

Nothing came of it.  No signs of a man, let alone an anomaly like a closet sitting solemnly in the middle of nowhere.  I apologized and saw the police officers off, too numb and exhausted to heed whatever advice they gave me.  I couldn’t bring myself to enter my bedroom, so I slept in my clothes on the couch, TV and lamp light on all the while.  

The weekend dawn came and went.  Saturday was here, and no camping was to be done.  I did eventually gather my groceries from the car.  Thankfully, the cold Appalachian fall nights kept most of the frozen stuff in a salvageable state.  Once again, I holed up in my home, trying to distract myself, smoking and drinking.  I had the curtains drawn all day.  I couldn’t stand looking out towards the woods.  By nightfall, I was beyond intoxicated, barely conscious as I lay on the couch watching TV.  Getting up to pee, I stumbled past the living room window, balancing myself with the curtain.  It shifted with me, and my drunken walking corpse couldn’t rebalance in time.  I tumbled to the hardwood floor, nearly bashing my head on the coffee table in the process.  With a clang, the curtain rod came down with me. 

Grunting, I pulled myself up, curtain still in hand.  My head throbbed as the abuse I had put my body through came rushing in all at once.  Rubbing my knee, I hobbled back to the couch and plopped down like the defeated sack of meat I was.  Returning my attention to my aching temples, I began rubbing them as I turned toward the scene of the tumble to see if anything besides the curtain had been damaged.  I slight dent in the wall from my elbow, and a bent curtain rod.  I realigned my sight to the window, hoping I hadn’t cracked it.  

The window remained intact, revealing the long stretch of lawn outside, lit by my back porch light as it flickered the last of its life away.  The dying illumination revealed something else.  In the woods just past my property line.  

It stared at me from the treeline.  Squarely facing me from the shadows.  That closet.  My scream winded me as I jumped from my couch.  My porch light died.  Black night pressed against my window, stifling all sight beyond those panes.  I ran to my doors, locking them, before running back to my window and pathetically attempted to fix the curtain.  The cheap aluminum rod was too bent to fit, and one of the hooks had been pulled out of the wall.  On the brink of tears, I pleadingly, tried to cover the window with a single dangling curtain.  My porch light flickered on for a second more, its last gasp at life.  

In the blink of an eye, I saw the closet on my lawn, before darkness hid it once again.  A moan of horror and defeat gasped from my throat.  Grabbing my phone, I tore to my room, locked the door behind me, and pulled the curtains shut before dragging my dresser in front of the window.  Another 911 call, promises of them being there soon.  

That was twenty minutes ago.  I’ve been hiding here all this time, hoping that writing this whole experience down on my phone would keep me sane for just a few more minutes.  And that someone out there will know how to help me.  

I think I hear someone knocking on my front door now.  It's still locked.  And I can’t answer it.  I’ve been in the corner of my bedroom for the last ten minutes.  The closet is in my room now.  I blinked one moment, and it had replaced my closet entirely.  The smooth click of its doorknob echoed in the room.  It's been creaking open ever since.  Centimeters at a time every couple of seconds.  Please, someone, believe me and help me.  Before it's too late.  



I see its hand now, gripping the side of the door.  Its rotting flesh contrasts with the pristine wood of the closet.  Please, someone, help me.

1) The Kents house is yellow ☀️ 
2) Lois puts too much sugar in her coffee ☕️ 
3) Lois likes punk rock/hair metal 🎸 
4) Luthorcorp, not Lexcorp 

I don’t think these are canon (for example, the Kent farmhouse was white in the earlier movies).

I’ve recently started a Discord server called SCIJ (Specialty Coffee in Japan), not to be confused with SCAJ. It’s for anyone living in Japan who’s into coffee. Whether you're a home brewer or an ex-barista/industry professional (like me), you're more than welcome!

The server is meant for async conversations about all things coffee in Japan: brewing, gear, cafes, beans. It’s also a space to share local info quickly and conveniently, and hopefully organize meetups or attend events like SCAJ and other coffee festivals.

If you're a resident and interested, feel free to DM me for the invite link.

Thanks!",2,1757513708.0,coffeejp,1,0.75,False
