Nothing really flirty, just getting to know her more while she’s on her shift. Recently her place has been busy and she’s been swamped a little more leaving little time to chat, and when she does get time to herself it’s usually her sitting down to relax for a minute. 

I don’t want eat up that time, knowing first hand how exhausting dealing with customers can be, so I usually just don’t bother her. Is this the right call? I want to talk with her more but I also want to respect her time. ",1,1761408714.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I mixed 5 oz of the Tazo chai concentrate (90 calories) with my 11 oz Nurri vanilla protein shake. It's absolutely delicious—probably better than Starbucks. As the weather gets colder, I may heat it up as my morning beverage, with some coffee added to make a dirty chai.

I'd thought my chai concentrate would just go bad b/c I don't have a need for the sugary drink anymore... but I have plenty of calories to spare most days and this is going to make me smile.

1ofvcjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Socionics/comments/1ofvcjo/yet_another_type_me111/,yet another “type me1!1!1”,"Hi all, I recently became interested in typology again after discovering I spent 8 years mistyped in MBTI as INFJ (I’m actually most likely INFP! FiNe ftw). I feel ready to tackle socionics, and am looking at EII and IEI, but totally open to other possibilities as well. I’m confused and would love guidance + your insights:

Section 1
1. How do you work? Why do people go to work? Are there any parameters that determine whether you can do work or not? What are they?
I work in short bursts of energy. Sustained work energy is tough and can get me angry. We work because we need money, but also, I really do think we’d get bored without working. If we look at the stress-to-performance-quality bell curve, I’d say I cannot do work if my stress level is too high. Alternatively, if there’s absolutely no external pressure, doing productive  work is impossible. 

1. How do you determine the quality of work? How do you determine the quality of a purchase? Do you pay any attention to it?

Quality of purchase can be determined by how it increases my comfort, if it works smoothly, if it looks pretty, lmao

1. There is a professional next to you. How do you know they are a professional? How do you evaluate their skill?
Their actions are smooth and well-polished. They can describe and/or explain their work, skill, or knowledge easily to someone.

1. If you struggle to do something, how do you fix that? Do you know if your performance is better or worse than others?
I try to reflect on what’s going wrong. It’s really hard to tell what to fix without concrete feedback OR observing a concrete example. I judge my performance by observing others, looking at feedback, and looking at myself.

1. How do you measure the success of a job? What standard do you use? Do you pay attention to it? When should you deviate from this standard?
Success usually comes with satisfaction and feeling like I’ve truly put my best effort forth. This is further enhanced by feedback.

Section 2
1. What is a whole? Can you identify its parts? Are the parts equivalent to the whole?
Jesus Christ

1. What does ""logical"" mean? What is your understanding? Do you think that it correlates with the common view? How do you know you are being logical?


1. What is hierarchy? Give examples of hierarchies. Do you need to follow it? Why or why not? Explain how hierarchy is used in a system you are familiar with.
A hierarchy example would be the ER I worked in as a tech last year. Of the clinical workers, I was at the bottom. Then came the nurses, the midlevels/APPs and the charge nurse, then the physicians.

1. What is classification? How does classification work? Why is it needed and where is it applied? Give examples.
To me, classification 

1. Are your ideas consistent? How do you know they are consistent? How do you spot inconsistency in others' ideas?
It’s 50-50 and really depends on the subject. I can spot *possible* inconsistency in someone else’s idea when it stops making sense in my brain. however, I guess that would say more about the consistency of my own framework then???

Section 3
1. Can you press people? What methods do you use? How does it happen?
I often choose not to, I’m pretty keen on respecting people’s boundaries. If I want info/gossip out of someone, I usually lead with something like “you don’t have to tell me” or “while being respectful of this person’s business.” I’m usually not gonna spread this info around to other people and won’t press too hard if someone isn’t comfy sharing.

1. How do you get what you want? What do you do if you have to work to get what you want?
I try to share my reasonings for why I want what I want. I can be pretty firm in this, but I’m willing to compromise on at least some aspect of my plan usually

1. How do you deal with opposition? What methods do you use to defend your interests?
It depends on how formal the circumstance is. If someone meets me with hostility and it’s very formal or I sense I’m weaker in a power imbalance, I shrink. However, if I have to defend an idea, I usually share what it means to me, or even to a perceived someone else.

1. When do you think it's ok to occupy someone's space? Do you recognize it?
I have a problem with interjecting myself where I shouldn’t be :’)

1. Do others think you are a strong-willed person? Do you think you have a strong will?
I think so. I’m pretty persistent once I set myself on some sort of goal.

Section 4
1. How do you satisfy your physical senses? What examples can you give? What physical experiences are you drawn to?

My senses are best satisfied alone. Good food, no plans, in cozy and fresh clothes, watching something good, and then crawling into bed with nothing to do the next day. Slow mornings with good coffee are also important. However, I guess in terms of physical *experience,* dance is a big one. I enjoy *feeling* the music and creating a visual component to something auditory.

1. How do you find harmony with your environment? How do you build a harmonious environment? What happens if this harmony is disturbed?

1. What does comfort mean to you? How do you create it?
See the first point under this section. 

1. How do you express yourself in your hobbies? How do you engage yourself with those things?
I love my hobbies (art, dance, gaming) because they let me explore my inner world in some way. I love either zoning out (mental low-stakes multitasking) or really focusing on a mental image during the creative process. I view my art as an extension of myself.

1. Tell us how you'd design any room, house or an office. Do you do it yourself, or trust someone else to do it? Why?
Generally, no one else is choosing the decorations for my physical space. I’m picky as hell with aesthetics and my space needs to reflect ME. I like a warm and earthy aesthetic with nice colors + patterns, but I also like to include fan art + trinkets + mementos of media I like. It needs to feel cozy and very subtly gay. However, I’d trust someone else to put things for a house together. Sometimes, a physical, practical, or mechanical task has the potential to piss me off.

Section 5
1. Is it acceptable to express emotions in public? Give examples of inappropriate expression of emotions.
Happiness and passion can always be expressed. People can feed off of the emotional atmosphere, so I feel like negative emotions should be expressed *tactfully.* Inappropriate expression would be crying and screaming at someone in public, partially because it puts the other person in an uncomfortable position. If you’re in a ton of pain tho…idk, this can be kind of murky

1. How do you express your emotions? Can you tell how your expressions affect others in a positive or negative way?
I’m sometimes a heart-on-the-sleeve type of gal. My emotions have to come out to someone extremely trusted or like on a private account or somewhere. I feel some emotion’s pretty strongly, and they can bubble over if they aren’t let out somehow. Bottling emotions up usually makes them expand like shaking up a sealed soda bottle.

1. Are you able to change your demeanor in order to interact with your environment in a more or less suitable way? How do you determine what is suitable?
Yes, to an extent. If I’m tweaking about something, it’s tough. Suitable is often based on the general emotional and situational atmosphere, including level of formality.

1. In what situations do you feel others' feelings? Can you give examples of when you wanted to improve the mood of others?
It’s hard for me to feel others’ emotions without either experiencing it or putting myself in someone else’s shoes. Happiness or being happy for someone is easy. I can worry about someone who’s really sad. However, *feeling* others’ emotions requires putting myself in someone else’s shoes

1. How do others' emotions affect you? How does your internal emotional state correlate or contrast with what you express?
If someone is angry, I can also become angry, but sometimes towards them. It’s like reacting defensively??? I can also become sad or hurt in the process if I feel targeted. I try to be authentic in my emotional expression, but I can sometimes dial back negative emotions by writing them out, texting my mom etc so that I don’t lash out or take out my feelings on someone else.

Section 6
1. How can you tell how much emotional space there is between yourself and others? How can you affect this space?

How deep are our conversations? This doesn’t have to mean philosophical convos, but even just talking about passions, hobbies, emotional fluctuations, and little “irrelevant” life details represents closeness. Also, receptivity to these discussions and how often we engage with each other.

1. How do you determine how much you like or dislike someone else? How does this affect your relationships?

Firstly - what are their morals and belief systems like? This immediately places a huge plus or minus. How do they treat others, including service workers and strangers? Also, authenticity. Do I feel like they’re showing me their real self, and can we discuss our passions and interests together? Is our humor compatible and does conversation flow?

1. How do you move from a distant relationship to a close one? What are the distinguishing characteristics of a close relationship?
See the above on emotional distance. I feel like a relationship is close if I can freely discuss these things, we make efforts to spend time together, and I feel like I can show myself without rejection.

1. How do you know that you are a moral person? Where do you draw your morality from? Do you believe others should share your beliefs on what's moral? Why?

I grew up in an upper class, more conservative family, so I had to question my family’s morals and look at various points of society to form my own morals. How would I feel if I was in X-marginalized-person’s place? If I was screaming for help and no one was listening?? This has driven me to be more progressive.

1. Someone you care about is acting distant to you. How do you know when this attitude is a reflection of your relationship?
Are they distant towards just me or in general? When they’re acting off, do they seem to be distracted or preoccupied with something, or just unhappy with me?

Section 7
1. How can you tell someone has the potential to be a successful person? What qualities make a successful person and why?

Is there drive? Is there passion? Success is also very relative. “Success” as defined in American society can often be achieved by stepping on toes and willingly throwing those “below” you under the bus to get ahead. People who are more callous and less sympathetic of the underdogs are more likely to be “successful” in this regard. However, someone with empathy, heart, resources, AND drive is often the one to be successful and incite change

1. Where would you start when looking for a new hobby? How do you find new opportunities and how do you choose which would be best?

Internet + external inspiration. Interacting with something inspiring can create a burst in creativity that I feel motivated to act on. Sucks when the ideas don’t flow tho.


1. How do you interpret the following statement: ""Ideas don't need to be feasible in order to be worthwhile."" Do you agree or disagree, and why?
1000% agreed. Sometimes brainstorming and creative thinking is just fun. Fantasy is fun. However, it really sucks when you get married to an idea and it is entirely impractical.

1. Describe your thought process when relating the following ideas: swimming, chicken, sciences. Do you think that others would draw the same or different connections?
ok, I’m a scientist, so keep in mind that this affects my connections:
I first saw a chicken in a swimming pool. When I imagine connecting science to the other two, I ask, what can we study from this? Maybe a chicken’s stress levels in a swimming pool? Any cellular changes? What about the impacts of the chlorine on feather health? I’m not a physicist, but the physics of chicken swimming??? We could also imagine scientists eating chicken wings sitting in a swimming pool. That’d be dope as hell.

1. How would you summarize the qualities that are essential to who you are? What kind of potential in you has yet to be actualized and why?
Creativity if the first one. I’m freshly graduated from college and I’m bursting  at the seams to be creative, but I have limited resources now. However, intelligence, kindness, integrity, being analytical, and individuality (god there’s probably some grammar issues here) are all important qualities I value.


Section 8
1. How do people change? Can you describe how various events change people? Can others see those changes?
We experience, we learn, *we reflect,* our brains develop, we experience both joy and suffering. This can be gradual, or a sudden change in our brain’s wiring if something is traumatic enough. I will never truly *feel* the changes someone goes through, but interactions with someone can give me a glimpse. I can often sense if someone is off, but I never know how to help.

1. How do you feel and experience time? Can time be wasted? How?
Time is weird. It’s logical and makes linear sense, but my brain is rarely in the physical moment. I’m often living somewhere else, even if I’m focused on the present or very near future. Time can be wasted pretty easily. I waste time by overthinking, piddling around, and doom scrolling. However, people often think feelings (like loving someone you later split with) = wasted time. I disagree.

1. Is there anything that cannot be described with words? What is it? If so, how can we understand what it is if language does not work?
Probably a fair amount. Some things are better expressed as a picture, a video, a dance, a space, a gesture.

1. How do you anticipate events unfolding? How can you observe such unfoldments in your environment?
Sometimes it’s a gut feeling, often it’s something I’ve seen before. An example - I had to leave a job shortly after joining because the boss and I did not click. I continuously fell short of his expectations after he failed to train me. I left because I didn’t see things improving. When I met my replacement, I saw some of myself in her, and I just got a very deep, gut feeling that she would be subject to a similar fate. She quit 1-2 months later.

1. In what situations is timing important? How do you know the time is right to act? How do you feel about waiting for the right moment?
Timing is important when meeting someone, doing things that interact with the world, or rely on the feedback or interactions of others. The “right time” is sometimes intangible and a gut feeling. I think waiting for the right moment is important sometimes, but other times, I can’t be assed.",1,1761408458.0,Socionics,2,1.0,False

1ofvb3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ofvb3u/i_have_never_been_the_same_since_walking_under/,I have never been the same since walking under that broken streetlight.,"I've never been one to believe much in the supernatural, nor would anyone call me superstitious by nature, but since a certain incident in my twenties, I’ve found myself wondering whether we really are alone in the dark. You see, I worked graveyard shift back then—hell, I still do—and I grew up in a small town in New England. I worked with a buddy of mine, and since we were the only ones in our friend group awake at those hours, he’d often invite me over late at night to hang out until the early morning. 

The thing was, even though I was in my twenties, I didn’t have a car. He’d offer to pick me up sometimes, but out of modesty I usually refused, unless the weather was bad enough to make the walk miserable. It wasn’t a long trip anyway, maybe a bit over a mile, and straight the whole way. I lived on the outskirts of a small city, if you could even call it that. At its largest, it might’ve had twenty thousand residents, give or take. 

My family had been there since the 1930s, starting with my grandmother. She never left, and my father raised his own kind of hell around that same small town through the ’70s and early ’80s. Now, twenty thousand people might sound like a lot to some of you, but in a place like that, it isn’t. In a town that size, everyone seems to know at least one other person in your family. 

The only reason I bring this up is because of what happened one random night on my way to my friend Doug’s place. I’d made that walk dozens of times before and never had any problems. But ever since I was a kid, I’d always been afraid of the dark. It’s embarrassing to admit, but even as an adult, that fear never really went away. 

The walk itself was mostly fine. Quiet streets, a straight shot down a sleepy neighborhood. A little past the halfway point to Doug’s, among all the brightly lit streetlights, was this one house that had a dying streetlight out front. It didn’t stay dead; it buzzed weakly, flared, then dimmed again, perpetually fighting to stay alive. 

I watched a lot of horror movies growing up, and at around 10 p.m., most of the houses were already dark. It always felt like I was the only soul out there. And that flickering streetlight…it scared the hell out of me. Like I said, I’m not superstitious. But there was something about that light, the way it sputtered in the quiet, that made that space feel wrong. It was the same kind of wrong you feel when the victim would enter the room they would be murdered in those old horror movies. You know, the ones with the clueless teenagers, the killer in a mask, and the glint of a hatchet just before the screaming starts. 

But when that one light went out, when it flickered and died for those few seconds, it was different. The darkness that settled there wasn’t natural. It wasn’t just shadow; it was thick and absolute, as if the darkness gave license for malevolence to come alive. For that brief stretch of sidewalk, it felt like the world just…stopped. 

Reality itself would seem to thin out until you reached the safety of the next light. I can’t explain it better than that, just that stepping through that patch of dark always felt like crossing through something. Only briefly abating between the small moments of illumination. Since the road was straight, I could see that spot from a long way off, and maybe that was part of the problem. I’d start staring at it long before I ever got close, like my brain was trying to make it into something more than it was. 

Still, the closer I came, the worse it got. A creeping dread would crawl up my spine when I got within a couple hundred feet of that patch of dark, even though it only took seconds to cross it. 

Every time, I came out fine on the other side. Nothing ever happened. But in those few moments, swallowed by that intermittent inky blackness, I always felt like something was there. Like I was in real, immediate danger—though from what, I couldn't say. 

You have to understand; this “city” wasn’t exactly thriving. It was poor. The kind of place where the sidewalks cracked and stayed that way for years, where the power lines sagged, and the roads only got patched when they absolutely had to. 

So, a flickering streetlight on an otherwise functional street? That was nobody’s priority. It stayed that way for years, maybe decades. 

God, I wish they had fixed it. 

Like I said, nothing had ever really happened there. Just that constant, gnawing sense of dread whenever I walked through. But eventually, like everything left to rot long enough, that much-neglected streetlight finally gave up for good. 

One night, it just flickered…and went out. 

If I thought the dread was bad before, it was nothing compared to when that space fell into permanent blackness. The first night I saw it dead—no flicker, no weak glow, just a void—I nearly stopped walking altogether. Every time after that, I’d slow down as I approached, heart picking up, mouth going dry. I’d tell myself the usual things: Stop being a baby. This is stupid. You’re a grown man, for God’s sake. 

But none of it helped. Standing there at the edge of that darkness, I didn’t feel like a man anymore. I felt like a kid again...small, helpless, and terrified of what might be waiting where the light couldn’t reach. 

Even then, I’d force myself to swallow the fear and just walk through it. It wasn’t far, barely half a minute at a steady pace, and every time, nothing happened. 

This went on for weeks. Same dread, same routine, same relief once I reached the next pool of light. 

Until one night. 

I’d been standing there at the edge longer than usual, caught in that same argument with myself—Just go, it’s fine, stop being stupid—when I finally stepped forward. I was so lost in my thoughts that I almost didn’t notice it at first. 

A voice. 

“Nice night, isn’t it?” 

The words were harmless enough but hearing them disembodied in that thick blackness froze the blood in my veins. The voice wasn’t close, exactly, but near enough. I squinted into the dark and could just make out the faint outline of the porch, the one belonging to the house with the dead streetlight. 

And there he was. A tall figure sitting back in what I could barely make out as a lawn chair, the faint orange glow of a cigarette the only light in the void. 

Here’s the thing—despite all the dread, despite that creeping terror that gripped me every time I reached that spot—in a town that small, you were always taught to be polite to your neighbors. 

So, when it finally registered that it wasn’t some monster speaking to me from the dark, but just a man, I forced myself to answer. My voice came out far steadier than I felt. 

“Yeah,” I said. “A bit cold, but otherwise nice and clear.” 

He didn’t respond right away. I could see the faint ember of his cigarette brighten as he took a long drag, the tip glowing briefly in the dark. After a slow exhale and what felt like an eternity of silence, he finally spoke again. 

“You’re Mark’s kid, right?” 

I froze. 

Mark was my father. Something about his casual tone implied familiarity to me.  Knowing a bit of my mom and dad's history, the realization hit me, this man must’ve known him back in his younger days. It was the only explanation, seeing as my father barely left the house anymore. 

You see, my father was what doctors call a “cardiac cripple.” That’s what they said after his last heart attack. An attack so severe it left him weak, struggling just to get around, his life permanently slowed to a crawl. 

I tried to play it off like I wasn’t startled. 

“Yep,” I said, keeping my tone as even as I could. “Mark’s my dad. You know him?” 

It was a stupid thing to say, he’d literally just mentioned my father by name, but I wasn’t exactly thinking straight at that moment. My nerves were still heightened from hearing a voice out of the dark. 

The man took another slow drag from his cigarette. The ember glowed, then faded again. He sat there quietly for a few seconds before finally speaking. 

“Yeah,” he said, his voice low and drawn out, like someone too tired and oddly sad. “Your dad and I used to party back in the day. Lived like there was no tomorrow. Though… eventually he calmed down and had that family of his.” 

I figured he meant my mom, my brothers, and me. It wasn’t strange. My dad had been a wild one when he was younger. A lot of the older folks in town had stories. But something about the way this man said it—slow, almost nostalgic—made me uneasy in a way I couldn’t quite place. 

“A shame how he died,” the man said after another long pause. “Your dad. I never expected a heart attack to take old Mark down.” 

For a second, I just stood there, not sure if I’d heard him right. Then I frowned. “Oh...no, my father’s not dead. Yeah, he had a heart attack, but he’s doing fine. Well… as fine as someone can be after something like that.” 

The man didn’t say anything right away. The only sound was the faint crackle of his cigarette. Then the ember flared again, one long inhale that seemed to stretch too long, followed by another heavy exhale. 

He didn’t respond. Didn’t move. Just sat there in that impossible darkness...quiet. 

“No,” the man finally said. His voice was calm, too calm. “He died. I remember reading his obituary in the paper. Only happened a week ago, October 16th. Coroner pronounced him dead at eleven a.m.…after his son found him.” 

I stood there, staring into the black, the words hitting me one by one. 

That wasn’t possible. 

It wasn’t even October 16th yet; it was almost a month away. My father had a heart attack four months ago, and he was still alive. Frail, sure, but alive. 

“What?” I managed, but my voice came out trembling. I wanted to sound angry, wanted to challenge the lie, but all I could feel was confusion. Somehow, hearing it in that tone, in that darkness, part of me believed he meant it. 

“Well,” the man said, his tone unchanged, smooth and unbothered, “you look like you’ve got somewhere to be. I’m sure you don’t want to be stuck talking to an old man like me all night.” 

He didn’t move. Didn’t nod or wave. Just sat there, head still, the ember of one cigarette fading as he lit another with slow, deliberate care. 

“Have a good night now,” he added. 

It was then I realized how long I’d been standing there, in that darkness I’d always hated. My skin crawled, a cold sweat dripping down my back. Determined to brush it off as something mundane, something strange. Maybe he was drunk or high and just trying to make small talk. I forced a polite, “You too,” and started walking again. 

I didn’t look back. 

The rest of the walk went on without incident. No more voices, no movement, nothing but the sound of my own footsteps and the rustling wind in the trees. Before long, I was back under the steady wash of streetlights, their soft buzz oddly comforting after what I’d just heard. The darkness behind me felt heavier somehow, like it was still watching as I walked away. 

I’ve always had a bit of a temper, and the more I replayed that conversation on my way to Doug’s house, the more it pissed me off. 

Who says something like that to a man’s kid? Who tells someone their father’s dead like it’s casual small talk? It wasn’t polite. It wasn’t normal. So why the hell was I polite back? Why didn’t I tell him to fuck off and mind his own damn business? 

I kept turning it over and over in my head, trying to make sense of it. But every time I pictured standing there in that dark stretch of road—the glow of the cigarette, that voice—something cold crawled up from my gut. That same dread I’d felt before crept back in, quiet but inevitable. By the time I got to Doug’s place, he could tell right away that something was off. I must have looked pale or rattled, at the very least. 

We walked into his tiny apartment; a cramped little space tucked behind the old comic shop his parents owned. The place always smelled faintly of paper, dust, and burnt coffee. Doug dropped onto the couch, eyeing me with that mix of concern, immediately sensing my unease. “Dude,” he said, brow furrowing, “what happened? You okay?” 

I’d told Doug before about that streetlight and how stupid it made me feel to be scared of it, even as an adult. He’d laughed it off at the time, said he sometimes went for late-night runs himself and that even he found that stretch a little unnerving. So, when I told him what had happened—the man on the porch, the things he’d said—Doug just stared at me, wide-eyed and speechless for a moment. 

“That’s a hell of a fucked-up thing to joke about,” he finally said. 

“Yeah,” I replied, though I didn’t sound convinced. “I’m not sure it was a joke. Maybe he was high, or drunk, or just… burned out enough to believe what he was saying.” 

Doug nodded slowly but kept glancing at me like he was trying to read something behind my words. And for the rest of the night, even as we talked about other things, I couldn’t shake the image of that porch and the faint orange glow of a cigarette floating in the dark. 

As our night ended, marked by the pale glow of sunrise creeping over the rooftops, I said goodbye to Doug and started walking back home. It wouldn’t have been hard to take another route, maybe cut through a side street or two, but that would’ve added time, and I was exhausted. I just wanted to get home the quickest way possible. Besides, it was dawn by then. The streetlights had gone out, and the road was bathed in that soft gray light that makes everything look harmless. I told myself the man had probably gone to bed hours ago. 

I figured I’d pass by without incident, no voices, no cigarettes glowing in the dark. Just a quiet walk home in the morning air. 

There was a steady surge and lull of early-morning traffic—commuters heading to their seven-to-fours and eight-to-fives—and for the first time in a while, I felt completely at ease. The sun was up, the world was awake, and all that nighttime dread felt foolish in hindsight. 

Then, just before the halfway point, I realized where I was. 

I was standing in front of the house with the broken streetlight. 

I’d never really looked at it in daylight before. Without the shroud of darkness, it seemed ordinary enough, just another aging house on a quiet street. Still, something about it drew my attention. I stopped walking and stood there for a moment, taking it in. It looked plain enough in the morning light, ordinary, almost. But the longer I stood there, the more I realized how wrong that first impression was.  

The house looked abandoned, though not completely derelict. It was a tall, two-story place with faded blue paint that had been chipping for what must’ve been decades. Four windows faced the street, two on the top floor, two on the bottom. The lower left one had a corner cracked out, patched clumsily with duct tape and a piece of cardboard that had long since gone soft from weather. 

If anyone lived there, you wouldn’t know it. There were no curtains, no decorations, nothing in the yard, just two old lawn chairs sitting side by side on the porch angled toward the street. I found myself staring at those windows for a long time, trying to see inside. The light was poor, the glass smeared with dust and time, but even squinting, I couldn’t make out any furniture. No shapes. No movement. 

Whoever lived there—if anyone did—either kept things impossibly spartan…or didn’t live there at all. 

Even in the daylight, that uneasy feeling began to creep back in. It wasn’t as strong as it was at night, but it was there, distant but distinct, like a faint echo under my skin. I told myself I was being ridiculous and decided to keep moving. 

Dad didn’t sleep much these days. His last heart attack had left him with a strange rhythm, three or four hours of sleep, three or four awake, like his body couldn’t decide which it preferred. This was usually one of the times he was up, so I figured I’d stop and talk with him for a bit before heading upstairs to bed. Small talk, nothing serious. Just a few words between us before I crashed for the day. 

It felt comforting somehow, the thought of walking into that warm, familiar house after the strangeness of the night and seeing him sitting in his usual spot. I stepped inside and just stood there for a moment, letting the quiet comfort of home settle over me. The speakers of my father’s computer drifted from his room, that familiar sound that always meant he was up and moving. 

“Dad, I’m home,” I called out as I hung my jacket by the door. 

“Good morning, son,” came his reply, steady and warm, unmistakably alive. 

I walked to his doorway, and we talked for a few minutes about nothing in particular. The kind of small talk that fills the space between people who know each other too well to need many words. I found myself smiling, just happy to see him there, breathing, talking, real. Standing in that doorway, it hit me how absurd the night before had been. Whatever that man on the porch had said, whatever I’d thought I’d heard, it was nonsense. My father was here. Alive. Fine. 

I gave him a hug, told him I’d see him later, and headed upstairs to bed. Within minutes, the comfort of the house swallowed me whole, and I drifted into sleep. 

I didn’t have to work that night, I kept my graveyard schedule even on days off. It made things easier than constantly flipping between day and night. Besides, it had its perks. When the weekend rolled around, I could stay out later than everyone else, long after most people were nodding off around one in the morning. 

When I finally woke up, the sun was already gone, and my phone buzzed with a text from Doug: 

“You up for hanging out again tonight?” 

I stared at it for a moment, debating. I had nothing else to do, so I typed back a quick “yeah, sure,” and hit send. As soon as I set the phone down, the thought crept in... the walk there, that stretch of road, the house, and the broken streetlight. 

A shiver ran through me before I could stop it. I tried to laugh it off, but the image of that man sitting in the dark, cigarette glowing faintly on the porch, wouldn’t leave my head. I brushed my thoughts off as absurd. My father was alive, and that was proof enough that the man’s words had been nothing more than some drunken or drug-fueled nonsense. Whatever strange, prophetic tone he’d used, it didn’t matter. He was probably just another lost soul in a rundown town talking to himself, talking to anyone who’d listen. 

Even if he was there again, I told myself I’d just keep walking. No hesitation, no stopping to chat. Just pass by, mind my own business, and leave that gnawing void behind me. 

I didn’t change anything about my usual routine. Before heading out, I checked in on my dad, he was asleep, the deep kind of sleep that comes after one of his tiring brief stints awake where he pushed himself a little too far to stay up. I made him a quick dinner, something simple he could heat up when he woke, and left a note on the fridge like I always did. Normally, I’d just scribble down what it was and what shelf it was on. But this time, without really thinking about it, I added three extra words at the bottom: 

I love you. 

I stared at it for a second after I’d written it, unsure why I’d felt the need. The man’s words from the night before had unsettled me more than I wanted to admit, like some part of me, buried deep down, didn’t want to take any chances. With that, I started my usual trek down to Doug’s house. The night air was cool, the streets were mostly empty, just the faint murmur of distant traffic and the soft scuff of my shoes against the pavement. 

And then, like always, I saw it, well before I reached it. 

That stretch of darkness. 

Even from far away, the black abyss where the streetlight used to glow was unmistakable. It loomed there, a void in the middle of the quiet avenue, like it was waiting for me. It almost felt alive, as if it were taunting me for coming back, or worse, beckoning me toward it. 

Step by terrible step, I approached, hoping the man on the porch wasn’t there again. It was 10:00 p.m., and not a soul, save me, was out on the streets. I reached the edge of the dead streetlight and paused, weighing whether I should backtrack a block and take a detour. I stared into the darkness of the porch and, after a moment, couldn’t make out anyone sitting in either chair this time. 

I built up my courage and stepped into the dark. The quiet night air was broken by the approach of a car, its headlights washing the void with merciful light. As it approached, it began to drift towards my side of the street. I thought for sure it was going to hit that broken streetlight, but shortly before it reached me, the car corrected itself and slowed down to a stop right next to me. 

I was on edge given the circumstances, but it was just my aunt. She’d seen me walking and wanted to ask how my dad was. The relief I felt in that instant, I can’t describe. I hid a sigh and told her he was doing as well as he could, given everything. She asked if I needed a ride, and stupidly I said no, since she was headed in the opposite direction.  

The greatest regret of my life to this day is not accepting that ride. 

We said our goodbyes, and no sooner had I started to traverse the dark again than that same tired voice drifted out: 

“Nice night, isn’t it?” 

To say the blood in my veins froze would be an understatement—I’m pretty sure it hit absolute zero. My head snapped to the porch, and there he was again, the same faint glow of a cigarette hanging in the dark. I told myself I’d just keep walking. That’s what I’d promised myself, just keep moving. Don’t stop. Don’t look. 

So why didn’t I? 

No matter how much I willed myself forward, I couldn’t move. It was like something invisible had wrapped around my legs, holding me there. My mouth went dry, my mind blank. What was I so afraid of? He hadn’t threatened me before. Sure, he’d said some strange, unnerving things, but he hadn’t tried to hurt me. Maybe he was just some old man, lonely and confused, maybe high out of his mind. That’s what I told myself, anyway. 

Finally, forcing the words out through a dry throat, I managed to stammer, “You know… I never got your name, friend. You said you know—knew—my father. I don’t think he ever mentioned you.” 

He took not one, but two long drags of his cigarette before answering; each one stretching the silence into something unbearable. The ember flared, dimmed, flared again. 

“Luke,” he finally said. 

That was it. No explanation, no story, no follow-up about how he’d known my father or when. Just Luke. I don’t know what I was expecting, something familiar maybe? Something that would make the whole thing make sense, but Luke wasn’t it. Despite the fear tightening in my chest, I almost laughed. The absurdity of it, the plainness of the name after all that tension was ridiculous. That brief flicker of humor didn’t last. Because the moment he said it, something in the air seemed to shift. The space between us felt heavier somehow. And though I couldn’t explain why, I got the sense that by speaking his name aloud, he’d won something—like we’d been playing a game I didn’t know I was part of, and he’d just made the final move. 

“You know, Luke…” I said, a chill running through me just for speaking his name aloud. “How exactly did you know my father?” 

Out of all the things I could’ve said in that moment, I wish to God, I hadn’t asked that. 

His voice changed. Low and wet at first, then twisting into a snarl that made every hair on my body stand up. Slowly, he rose from the chair. He was huge. Hulking, wrong. Far taller than any man had a right to be, his outline seeming to stretch beyond what the dim light of the cigarette could possibly show. 

The cigarette burned between his fingers as he lifted it to his mouth one last time, inhaling so hard the ember flared blood-red. Then, through teeth clenched around smoke, he roared: 

“ASK. YOUR. MOOOOOTHEEEER!” 

The sound tore through the air—half scream, half animal noise—and then he moved. He came off that porch like lightning, appendages twisting and bending at sickly angles as they pounded down the steps toward me, and for a second, I couldn’t even breathe. My whole body locked in place, my mind refusing to believe what my eyes were seeing. 

Then something snapped in my head, and instinct took over. I ran.  

I ran harder and faster than I ever had in my life, heart slamming against my ribs like it was trying to escape too. As I broke free from the darkness beneath that dead streetlight, I made the mistake of looking back. He was standing there, right at the edge of the void. Perfectly still. The cigarette still glowed in his mouth, but now…the glow reached his eyes. 

I remember crying. By the time I reached Doug’s place, I was a wreck, shaking, out of breath, barely able to speak. He didn’t ask questions right away, just let me inside and locked the door behind us. Once I could breathe again, I told him everything. Every detail, even the parts that made me sound insane. The man on the porch. His name. The way he changed. The voice. The eyes. I let it all come out because it was impossible to keep inside. Doug just listened. His face was pale; his expression caught somewhere between concern and disbelief. When I finished, he quietly poured me a drink and handed it over without a word. 

There wasn’t much he could say. What comfort could you offer someone describing something like that? I was trembling, half-drunk on adrenaline and fear, more terrified than I’d ever been in my life. All I could manage was, “Can I crash here tonight?” 

“Yeah, man,” he said, without hesitation. He disappeared into his room while I lay down on that tiny couch in his even tinier apartment. Somehow, it felt like it was the safest place in the world. Sleep came eventually, but it wasn’t peaceful. I dreamed of Luke, his wet, snarling voice, and those burning red eyes. 

Doug gave me a ride home the next morning. I didn’t even want to walk past that house, not even in the daylight. 

When I got home, Dad was up. He looked at me with concern as soon as I came through the door. I told him I’d just had too much to drink with Doug, and he accepted it, though I could tell he didn’t believe that was the whole story. I went upstairs, still trembling, and lay down again. Somehow, I was still exhausted, like the fear that night had drained something vital out of me. 

When I woke up, it was late afternoon. The light outside was soft and gold, but for the first time, it didn’t feel comforting. It felt like the day was running out too soon. All I could think about was Luke’s, or whatever the hell that was, last words. Ask your mother. What did that mean? He’d never mentioned her before. Up until that moment, brief as those two encounters had been, everything he’d said had been about my father. 

My parents divorced years ago. I loved my mom, of course, but we weren’t especially close. We’d talk on holidays, birthdays, and the once-a-month call to let her know I was alive. But now, after everything that had happened, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I needed to call her. I sat on the edge of my bed for a long time, debating it, before finally picking up the phone. The line rang a few times, and for a second, I almost hung up. Then her familiar voice came through, light and cheerful as ever. 

“Hi, honey, you haven’t called in a while! It’s good to hear from you.” 

For a moment, I couldn’t respond. I just sat there, listening to her voice, trying to find the words. 

When I finally spoke, I decided to just be direct. 

“Hey, Mom… I know this is kind of a weird question out of the blue, but… do you know a friend of Dad’s named Luke?” 

The silence that followed was immediate, heavy, and it didn’t end. 

It stretched on and on, so long that I had to pull the phone away from my ear just to check if the call had dropped. But it didn’t. She was still there. 

Quiet. 

“Who told you about Luke, sweetie?” Her voice had changed, sharp now, suspicious. 

Before I could answer, she spoke again, louder, almost scolding. “I specifically told your father and grandmother to never to tell you boys about Luke!” 

“Mom—Mom, wait,” I said quickly, trying to calm her down. “Dad didn’t tell me about Luke. Luke did.” 

The silence that followed was worse than before. 

“He lives a little over half a mile down the street from me,” I added, my voice shaking a little. 

When she finally spoke again, her tone had shifted completely, no longer angry, but in disbelief. “Honey, that’s…that’s absolutely impossible.” 

I didn’t say anything. 

“Luke was your father’s best friend,” she went on quietly, her voice trembling. “Back in the seventies. That’s how we met, actually. I was Luke’s fiancée.” 

I blinked, gripping the phone tighter. 

“All three of us partied together for years,” she said. “Your father, me, and Luke. We were stupid back then, drinking, drugs, all of it. But I wanted to stop, to settle down, and Luke…didn’t. Mark, your dad, was in the same place I was. He was getting tired of that life. We fell in love, and Luke couldn’t handle it.” 

Her voice cracked, and I could hear her take a shaky breath. 

“Your father and I talked to Luke, and we ended up having a huge blowout” I could hear her sniffling on the other side of the line. “He started drinking more and more,” she said softly. “Then one night… drunk, he got behind the wheel. Crashed his car into a streetlight.” 

I didn’t breathe. 

“It was right in front of his home on the same street you live on.” She finished. “But honey… that was almost thirty years ago.” 

What she said next sent a cold shiver straight through me. 

“They never fully fixed that streetlight,” she said quietly, almost to herself. “God… since the city fixed it after he died, it’s been flickering on and off every time I drive by it.” There was a pause. I could hear her breathing, faint and uneven, remembering something she didn’t want to. 

“I always tend to think of Luke when I see it,” she added softly. 

I didn’t know what to say. I just sat there. The phone pressed to my ear, as I was staring out my window at the faint orange glow of the horizon beyond the trees. That was when I made the decision that I never wanted to walk down that road again. 

Three years have passed since that phone call with my mother. 

Dad was still alive but getting worse. The times he spent awake and asleep had grown shorter over the years, until his days were little more than fragments; his brief stretches of motion between equally brief stretches of rest. When he was up, he could still move around, do a few chores, even cook a small meal. But the effort always drained him. More often, he’d retreat to his room to lie down again, worn down by his own body. 

It was in the fall when I awoke one day to the sound of his alarm. I had heard it the night before drifting upstairs where my room was but given his even more odd schedule than mine, I didn't find it odd and had fallen asleep.  

When I woke up, I could hear it going off again. For a while, I told myself maybe he’d already gotten up. Maybe he was in the kitchen, or outside for air. There were rare days when he felt strong enough to take the car out, drive down to the corner store for coffee or groceries. But when I listened closer, the house was silent except for the persistent chime of his alarm. 

I walked to his room and pushed the door open. The bed was empty. The window beside it looked out over the driveway, and there his car sat, untouched. Confused, I stepped further inside. The room still smelled faintly of smoke; Dad had never quit, no matter how many times the doctors begged him to. A small ashtray sat beside his computer, a freshly lit cigarette still glowing. It was odd, I thought, because it looked like he hadn't been there for hours. 

That’s when my foot struck something. 

I looked down…and saw him. 

He had fallen beside his chair, one hand still clutching his chest. His face was peaceful, almost resigned. But I knew. I knew the moment I saw him that he was gone. 

My hands were shaking as I pulled out my phone to call 911. Tears blurred my vision for a moment before I wiped them away to see the screen. And that’s when I noticed the date.  

October 16th.

* Mostly metal instead of the plastic-y feel my other machines had (including a Keurig and Nespresso)
* Pump/heating looks solid enough and less likely to clog compared to pod machines
* Looks like water tank pops off easily, so cleaning/refilling shouldn’t be a headache 

My main issues have been pumps clogging and some electronic parts not working which causes the whole thing to stop working. Need a machine that lasts so please give your reviews on this.

Weighing up to a ton, these magnificent, muscular animals can pull and move tremendous loads. A single draft horse can haul up to 8,000 pounds. Such strength is difficult to imagine, but the lesson is more effective when I discovered what two horses working together can accomplish.

The obvious answer would seem to be 16,000 pounds or twice the weight one can drag behind him. But two of these horses can move up to 24,000 pounds—three times the weight one can tow. This alone illustrates the value of teamwork, but more impressive is the fact that when two draft horses are trained together and labor alongside each other, their pulling capacity increases to 32,000 pounds—four times the weight either could have moved alone!",4,1761408169.0,alcoholicsanonymous,1,1.0,False

Welcome to ISEKAI IRL: Truck-Kun’s Blessing, a chaotic, hilarious, and dangerously self-aware D&D campaign where your real-life stats determine who you become in a fantasy world after the divine fender-bender of destiny.


---

🚛 Premise

You were just living your normal life — maybe scrolling your phone, maybe running late to work — when fate (and a speeding delivery truck) struck you down. Instead of ending, your story begins anew. You awaken in a world of swords, monsters, and magic… but with a catch:

Your real-world self determines everything.


---

🎲 The Twist: “You Are Your Character”

Stats = You IRL
Players roll no stats. Instead, they calculate their Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma based on real-world equivalents.

Example: Bench press 200 lbs? STR 16.

Terrible sense of direction? WIS 8.

Can talk your way out of anything? CHA 18.

Still can’t remember your Netflix password? INT 9.


Class & Background
Your class and background are based on your personality, habits, and hobbies in real life.

Gym rat → Barbarian or Monk

Theater kid → Bard

Overworked barista → Warlock (Coffee Patron)

Gamer shut-in → Wizard (of Wi-Fi)


Race is Free for you to choose



---

⚡ Campaign Tone

Genre: Fantasy comedy isekai with moments of dark absurdity.

Vibe: A mix of Konosuba, Re:Zero, and D&D 5e chaos.

Rating: PG-16 (mild dark humor, existential panic, and bad life choices).

Core Themes:

Self-awareness vs destiny

Can you survive a world built for heroes when you were an accountant?

Truck-Kun giveth, and Truck-Kun taketh away.

On top of that, there are other chains like Caffè Nero and a bunch of local coffee shops too — all just a couple minutes’ walk away.
Why so many coffee shops in one place? You’d think people would pick something unique or try local coffee, but most end up at the global chains anyway. For a lot of locals, Starbucks and similar places are where you meet, work, or relax. Coffee isn’t just a drink here — it’s become a ritual. Even tourists get into the habit fast.

1ofuylm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ofuylm,Cupping workshop,"Attended a Cupping Workshop by Genetics Coffee Roasters at Something’s Brewing (Indiranagar, Bangalore)

It was perfect for beginners looking to get into specialty coffee and understand flavor notes better. Wanted to share some key takeaways from the session 

⸻

1. The Critical Importance of Resting Your Roasted Beans

The most common mistake that leads to harsh or uneven coffee? Brewing beans that are too fresh.

When coffee is freshly roasted, it releases gases aggressively — which interferes with extraction.
	•	Avoid “Off-the-Roast” Brewing: Don’t brew coffee right after roasting. You’ll often get a harsh taste and poor flavor extraction (and maybe unfairly blame the roaster).
	•	Check the Bloom: If your bloom is too aggressive during pour-over/French press, your beans are too fresh — the water can’t extract properly.
	•	Recommended Resting Periods:
	•	Light roast: 3–4 weeks
	•	Medium roast: 2–3 weeks
	•	Dark roast: 1–1.5 weeks
	•	Shelf Life Note: Once rested, coffee stays flavorful for ~3 months, with aroma strong for at least 2 months.

⸻

2. Understanding Flavor Complexity & Extraction

Coffee’s flavor notes (acidity, sweetness, body, bitterness) come from the bean’s internal chemistry, not from nearby plants on the farm.
	•	Those “strawberry, jasmine, or clove” notes are inherent to the bean itself.
	•	Flavors are unlocked only when the bean is ground and meets hot water — like crushing pepper to release aroma.
	•	Missing the intended notes from your roaster? That usually means your brew parameters need tweaking (grind, temp, or ratio).

⸻

3. Using Cupping Notes as Your Brewing Compass

Cupping notes aren’t just for pros — they help you fine-tune your home brewing.
	•	Basic Evaluation: acidity, sweetness, body, aftertaste, bitterness.
	•	Advanced: Once you’re comfortable, look for flavor families (fruity, floral, spicy), then identify specifics.
	•	Cupping = Diagnostic Tool:
	•	If your coffee doesn’t taste like the roaster’s notes, tweak variables:
	•	Try a lower or higher water temperature
	•	Adjust grind size

⸻

4. Quick Cupping Technique Tip

If you want to try a basic cupping at home:
	•	Use a spoon that holds ~8ml of coffee.
	•	When “breaking the crust,” slice across the surface, don’t push down.
	•	Pressing down disturbs the bed and adds sediment to your spoon — ruining clarity.

They finally did it… The lab crew tamed Zaraz. Told it straight — “you play by our rules now.”
It didn’t go down easy. Fought like hell. But in the end? The crew won.

Special shout to our lab tech D — the man took it personally. Wouldn’t let Zaraz get the upper hand. Spent hours deep in its code, tweaking, testing, pushing back. And somehow, he did it.

Alongside the head lab monkey (his own title, don’t ask), they dropped in a 2TB drive, rebuilt the OS from the ground up, and pushed the system until even the coffee pot gave out — RIP to that old thing. (For legal reasons we all agreed ""it grew wings and threw it's self at the machine) (This didn't really happen) 

D kept at it, fine-tuning the OS, testing methods, optimizing everything. Two minds, two different approaches — same end goal. He’s been through generations of consoles, from PSX to PS4 and everything between, all to get Zaraz running better than ever.

Now… Zaraz is ready. Re-homed, reimagined, and waiting for someone who knows what they’re getting into — a machine with real potential.

1ofusda,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1ofusda/stuck_between_nespresso_convenience_vs_picopresso/,Stuck between Nespresso convenience vs Picopresso + grinder experience 😅,"Hey everyone,
I’m confused between two very different coffee paths and could use some advice from people who’ve been there.

On one side, there’s the Nespresso Essenza Mini — super convenient, press a button and you’re drinking coffee in a minute. Costs around ₹14k, practically no mess, perfect for rushed mornings.

On the other side, I’m fascinated by the Picopresso + a proper grinder (planning on Kingrinder K6). Total comes to around ₹20k. I know the coffee from fresh beans should be better… but it’s also more work every single time — grind, dial in, clean up, etc. Basically more of a hobby.

A few things I’m thinking about:
	•	Will I really taste a big enough difference vs Nespresso to justify the effort and extra cost?
	•	I’ll mostly be making coffees in the morning before I leave for work, and thinking if I buy picopresso it will just be a weekend hobby.
	•	Pods are definitely more expensive in the long run and create waste, but the convenience is so tempting.
	•	I like the “coffee brewing ritual” but I also know myself — if it’s too much hassle, I might just stop doing it daily.

So… is fresh-ground espresso from a Picopresso noticeably better enough than Nespresso to matter for someone who isn’t a hardcore purist? Or does Nespresso do a good enough job for daily home use?

PS: I currently use an AeroPress maybe once or twice a week, so I’m not totally new to manual brewing — just trying to figure out if jumping deeper into espresso land is worth it 😄",1,1761407093.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

  I read a lot in Omsk. It was one of the few pastimes I had during my labours. No, the prison didn’t have a library inside of it, it was part of the “Greater Omsk Penal Colony”. It did have a small cantina with a small shelf that stored magazines and books that one might find being donated by the public or family members. You know it’s actually really genuinely quite funny – the Soviet guards there gave me books that let me understand that they actually used the wrong English words for the place relative to the penal colony. The ‘correctional facility’ is worded correctly. They want to give people the impression that they bring political dissidents and exiles from the Union to be rehabilitated and made proper citizens in society again right? The wrong part they got is the ‘penal colony’. That one is to directly mean that they bring these people to secluded places far removed from society for punishment – in hopes that they interact as little as possible with society.

  Regardless, all of it had to be approved by the wardens in the prison we were in – “Correctional Facility Number 3” – mine had been called.

[Correctional Facility No. 3 Map - Prison - Omsk Oblast, USSR](https://mapcarta.com/W97665807)

[The Department of corrections of Omsk](https://spravochnik-telefonov.info/en/spravka/russia/omsk/upravleniya_ispolneniya_nakazaniy)

  I am all too aware that I should already be grateful. Because at least I made it out. Again, I think myself quite lucky to have made it out. After the USSR collapsed, rapid downsizing of prison bodies had to be made, especially following Glastnost, but before that, things got quite scary in these prisons. Really got way too full way too fucking quickly during Ligachev’s regime. It got to the point where uncertainties regarding the continued functionality of calendar data approaching the 2000s pushed for the regime to opt for a different and simpler method of processing inmates. I have to actually give it to them, that part of me which likes orderliness thinks it was quite efficient.

  In the attached photos of my previous post, I gave photos taken of the numbered markings they made on us before entering prison. They shave us clean and then ink our designated numbers without dates of birth or acquisition of citizenship in their systems for ease of identification. They called them Correctional Labels.

  That much above was context for some of the photos I’m sending to this forum and details I’m willing to share about my stay in Siberia. I think, anyways, that my stay wasn’t particularly eventful relative to many others in the buildings. I am sure you can find many other threads that put into detail the conditions there so that I don't have to here. Right now, what I can share is maybe some of the more difficult parts of my temporary detention in ALA. Maybe it can give some insights as to why it wasn’t possible for me to leave unconvicted.

  The three men sat across from me, the chairs made too short for the guy with the long face, his knees sticking up a bit while the little guy’s legs dangled off his chair – the one placed at the centre of the three – whilst the newcomer sat at his right hand side. Sharp cheekbones, a hooked nose and a pursed smile that never leaves, the man takes his time like the others did to get ready, removing his coat and preparing his documents. He places his papers on the table and pauses after before nodding to his colleagues.

  “We can begin,” He says in clear Bosnian.

  Shrill and strangely elastic, the man in the middle spoke in fast spitfire Kazakh. He goes on with few pauses. I could not understand him, only the translator that sat to his side that said, “Can you please confirm that the name that you have attempted to present to our customs officer is listed as ‘Emr Stefan Zlata’? And can you also look through these documents that you have handed over to us for processing shortly to match your own in detail?”

  ""It's Emir, actually""

  ""It is not. You signed your name before as Emr when you were here on your flight to Hanoi, Mr Zlata.""

  He was staring irately at me then. I dared not argue anymore.

  At that, the thin man slides over photocopies of my passport, travel documents, flight tickets and what have you to me over the table. I wanted to make sure and reached over to pull out my actual items of identification from my bag to check them against the photos. They had matched, and I nodded.

  Again, the little man squeals, sputtering out flicks of spittle in a coned area before him, some reaching me. The man on his right speaks in honeyed tones, almost lyrical, “Then you must be aware that you have submitted perjured counterfeits that are invalid in our airport here, ser?”

  Phlegm caked my throat but I swallowed it hard and replied, “I have done no such thing gentlemen, I can assure you of that. I know my rights and know that there exists a transitional period of sorts for my passport even if Bosnia has fallen, is there not?”

  There wasn’t any halt or pause however, they were not surprised, “And thusly, you have as well handed to us your old documentation of citizenship to this Yugolav State, yes? You need such proof of past citizenship to be granted some kind of passage here.”

  I nodded, “Yes, I believe so ser.”

  The tall guy to my right then rapped his pen on the desk, looking at those very documents I’d placed there. First the photocopy, and then the real deal. He bent over awkwardly trying to whisper something with enough unintelligibility to the short man in the middle. They did this for some time, going back and forth.

  “He is not going to let you through gospodin. Not today at least.”

  The words in Bosnian came from the translator who kept his smile and talked directly to me. I quickly eyed the guy in the middle who had still been occupied and motioned my head towards him, “I think you are mistaken ser. They must. UN statute.”

  His smile widened as they reached his eyes that closed shut. Shaking his head then, he didn’t say anymore, reaching into his coat pocket to pull out a metal flask with a strong-smelling liquid that he took sips of – alcoholic but not beer. I didn’t know what to make of it.

  At last, a conclusion is made by the two as the guy in charge continues, the translator his mouthpiece to me, “That is a falsity – lies to put it simply, for that state has apparently never existed.”

  Completely and utterly sure that he was just bullshitting me at this point, my voice raised in reply, “That’s not true!” only realising that I had pressed my hands against the table readying myself to stand up. I remembered quickly that I didn’t have the luxury to be frazzled then, “Th-that can’t be possible. And I think you know that it isn’t as well gentlemen. The Union was one of the first nations to recognise Yugoslavia as a sta-”

  “Yugoslavia – is gone. And we have withdrawn recognition of any state that had been Yugoslavia. Only the Yugoslav Confederation exists, which in itself does not recognise any preceding states it was founded by.”

  “Can I ask to see proof of that sers? I find it hard to believe.”

  At last, it was the thin-faced man who spoke, “I’m afraid you don’t have the right to demand anything from us. No.”

  I was shocked. At this point I knew for certain that this ordeal would take a while longer to settle. My breath, it hitched and started to release in shorter packets. And in that bated breath I tried my luck asking another question, “Well… what does that mean for me then? I- I want to call my embassy! The Bosnian Embassy! The Yugoslav mission! They still exist here do they not?!”

  The reply that came was voiced kindly, like a grandfather speaking to his boy, and it came from the translator.

  “I don’t think you understand the gravity of your situation Mr Zlata. You are not stateless, with rights outlined by the UN statute. You are never stated. Never before have you ever belonged to a state. You have no citizenship. Therefore, you have no legally recognized ethnicity, no official name, and no identity to which rights can be attached,” He takes another sip of his drink. Nobody speaks for a while, though I half-saw the tall man on my right taking glances at me in between writing some notes. I must have started to again feel that eroding pit in my stomach then as I realised that he might have been taking notes of how I was acting throughout the meeting. It was certainly important then with me apparently becoming some kind of living reject of this system.

  The one to break the silence was again the squealer in the middle, “There is another thing Mr Zlata. You say here in your document, however reliable, that you have gone for this meeting in Vietnam on the behalf of Energoinvest, yes? So for business purposes?”

  “That’s correct, ser. I’m sure that my business documents are present in my luggage that I can present y-”

  My luggage was gone though. I’d left it in my run away from the border troops in customs.

  At this, the tall man notes my reaction and leans forwards, asking a question himself, “You are a businessman going for a trip that long,” His hand still holding his pen is motioned questioningly, “Where is your luggage, hmm?”

  The dread – it bubbling into cold pinpricks of itch at the top of my head at this point. I had to straighten myself and stare to look at the man while I spoke next, “It is in the customs hall. I know it is. One of your guys there can retrieve it for whatever examination is necessary.”

  “But you were in the terminal. Why were you in custo-”

  “Shit! Shit! I know! I know alrea-,” 

  Then the click of a gun. The barrel aimed at my chest just above the height of the desk.

  I stopped breathing, hands understanding suddenly that universal sign of submission, raising them high up – ramrod straight actually. And in the absence of my breaths, I heard his through flared nostrils.

  The man in the middle spoke this time.

  “When I SPEAK, I SPEAK, FOR THE STATE… MISTER ZLATA,” He was speaking in Bosnian somehow, though I didn’t care in the slightest bit then. His last syllable dragged long and his gun slams into the table whenever he swung his arms as he spoke, and I winced as he continued, “and you will respect the state… DO YOU GO AGAINST THE PREMIERSHIP MISTER ZLATA?!”

  A second of silence passed, my heart’s thumping beating into my ribs, I could feel it in my head. I knew I had to say no — fast.

  The second moment of silence then passed. Muscles below my waistline were especially clenched inwards trying to stop the warm release of piss to run into my pants. Somehow, I still hadn’t said anything.

  The third came with his finger tightening on that trigger, just visible to me and finally, words came in wavering bleats, “No! No! I don’t go against your country ser! Have mercy please…”

  I remember trying to stifle even a single breath. I was in disbelief. It seemed so much like some kind of cruel and shitty trial

  I didn’t want to be the next one to speak but it seemed as if they were waiting for something.

  “Well can I call-”

  “No calls.”

  I hated the weakness of crying in the moment but I think I really felt something well up in my eyes then from the uncompromise of all of this sheerness. I saw the now tipsy translator lean into the squealer’s ear that made the short angry man laugh briefly, before slapping the other guy on the shoulder. His laugh started and stopped with snorts and wheezes. It took a time before he started talking again, “Okay, we can make an exception. There is likely a loophole somewhere we can set a precedent with your special case here with. You follow us now.”

  I looked up trying to trickle back the tears back into my eye sockets as I let out a shaky breath. The men were packing up a lot more quickly than I’d expected, especially that sleekly-dressed third person. Very soon, he was already in his coat and by my side, patting me gently on the shoulder and saying in a foreign language that I understood to that one of the west – English, “I believe.”

  “You believe what?”

  “Many things. But I believe that you are not telling any lies now,” Air hisses out of his beaked nose as he pockets his flask and leaves the room first.

  The time was a quarter past six when we left and at the moment where the sun should have been out already but I could not yet see it through the raised glass windows that adorned the ceiling. Those bleeding hues of light did not make in the sky. I did not fancy how I was being handled then, my hands were handcuffed behind me robbing me of some baser agency I had before as I was taken to the customs hall.

  Business men walked past eyeing me with some kind of disdain. The family with kids I’d seen before led their younger ones away from this man who had brown coffee stains on his pants, was unkempt and covered in dark patches of sweat, and was being led away in handcuffs through the airport. The walk saw the crack and chip of that item of dignity I had. To most of those people there, I looked back at them with a tested disdain of my own, knowing full well that I made a finer man than them – just one that was now in more dire and unforeseen circumstances. I half-smirked, fancying the fact that they would fare far worse than I then had they been in my situation.

  The lights flickered – some malfunction.

  We passed the halfway mark of that long stretch of airport and saw again the open glass wall with the bronze statue of Lenin that sat before the seats occupied by only one man. I saw him – I saw that bony moustached man with his ugly and yellowed toothy smile staring at me. I saw his dirtied garb – that of a heavy smoker and hollow interior behind that smile. He waved at me as I was brought past him, staring at me even as we were long passed. I wondered if he was still staring by the time I reached the customs hall at the end of the corridor.

  The customs hall still held those same open counters with the same lengthy lines that trailed into the same upper floor. They might and probably must have been more busy at this time of day. I wasn’t able to tell from down there though.

  I was jostled and shoved towards one of the border troops as the tall man showed the guard some kind of card in his hand. They spoke in Kazakh before leading me up the stairs we had just gone through and past the entire length of the terminal again. 

  Walking hurt in those cuffs. Whenever I lost my balance without my arms, one of the KGB guys would twist my arm to set me upright again, warmed metal cutting into my skin. We walked past that section  of the terminal again where the flight information was being displayed. The numbers looked weird. I’d actually thought I was just reading a weird convention of display for the dates but I quickly realised that it was in no way possible.

  The top of the board read letters for a flight to Rome being delayed to the year 2012. The flight below that was read as being a flight to London being delayed to 9038. I knew that it definitely had to be some kind of error with the system but something was biting at my stomach at the sight of the lack of reaction by the rest of the crowd. They just stared at it, one man even just pointing out his absurd delay listed to be over a millennia from now to another guy with too much nonchalance for comfort. I aired the question to the four men who were taking me somewhere, “Ah… new electronics in the airport right? Maybe malfunction in the flight boards, yes?”

  The guard was the first one to respond, seeming to snap out of some kind of daze for a second, “Oh… oh yeah I- I think I heard someone say something about that big storm. Something about the electromagnetism in the air being high and the temperature being off.”

  I muttered back, “Must have been a bad storm…”

  The sights of the airport terminal were familiar to me then. I knew that we were soon to come up to that statue again the next pillar over. Some relief swept over me seeing that golden wash of sun that filtered in through dirtied windows but went away as soon as I realised I might have to see that mustached man again. I can’t remember the last time I’ve met a man quite as strange as he, nor one carrying quite such a disagreeable disposition that he wore on him like that air of alcoholism I could taste so vividly even then. I didn’t want to look. I didn’t want to see more of what he looked like but it was hard not to.

  The airport’s sterile lights clashed with the sun in a way that was almost verdant as it cloaked a man sitting beneath the statue. I braced myself for that hideous smile again as I passed under Lenin’s shadow. All that it revealed however was a man reading his papers on one of the chairs. The other guy had gone – and so had the stains so visible before on the glass.

  The Lost and Found office was located in what I had assumed to be a washroom before. All that differentiated it from one on the outside was the little yellow paper put in one of those plastic card holders that read ‘Lost Articles Office’. 

  I coughed as I entered, the room being stuffed with dust and stale air that smelt like paint thinner. I honestly didn’t know what to think of it. I think part of me enjoyed the throwback to my younger days even though my throat itched like hell. It was the size of a janitor’s closet, its interior stocked with trinkets and lost items. They all collected dust then, and none of them were the very newly lost luggage that I’d brought with me.

  I could feel that rising itch that came up my spine to the top of my skull, a heat rising up my throat as I tried to think of what I could do next. The border troop spoke first, “This is everything. If it’s not here, it is not found yet, probably taken, or your guy here is lyi-”

  “It’s taken, thank you,” I interjected, “I’m sure someone took it and just hasn’t returned it.”

  It was the short guy who spoke next, “Be that as it may Mr Zlata, we have no evidence of that. This much will be placed under investigation by our team here. For now, we must head back to the discussion room to complete our lead up to this temporary verdict.”

  I look back at this moment as the moment I sunk too deep into a bad place in that airport. I think this was the first time I fully just nodded and accepted the man’s words without even questioning in my head that fact that we had walked around the entire length of this complex for no apparent reason. It scares me now, writing this. I only realised it decades later.

  We made it back into the room. The time was around a quarter to seven then I think. It was the same tired charade until they finally said something about me needing to look in the mirror and see what they were seeing – something about some degenerate threat who didn’t in the slightest look like a businessman in the first place. I remember the guy in the middle going angrily about my case before saying that he made some kind of verdict – it was to detain me until a verdict could be made. I didn’t argue.

  I must apologise to people following this post. I think this is all I manage today. Details come hard after this part. I feel like this one ended on a big of a bad note but there is hopeful news on my part today. One correspondent in Belgrade said they know a co-worker that fits the description of my wife that carries her name. I will continue again tomorrow.

1oful70,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtd/comments/1oful70/less_structure_more_productivity_anyone_else_feel/,"Less structure, more productivity: anyone else feel this?","Hey everyone,

Lately I’ve been in a super busy period, and it got me thinking about how productivity really evolves over time. I realized that every time I hit a “crisis point”, I start to overthink and overorganize. I’d set up perfect systems: folders, habit trackers, goals… and it all works… for about two weeks. Then it collapses.

Recently, I discovered something surprising: I’m actually **more productive and consistent when things are simple**. When I don’t have to jump across five tools to keep everything updated.

It turns out, all I really need are two things: a simple **habit tracker**, a place to quickly **jot down** notes without thinking about folders or categories, but still easy to search later

Funny enough, this all started with a simple WordPress blog. That minimal flow was liberating, and it reminded me that **simplicity often leads to the best results**.

Just a reminder to anyone feeling overwhelmed: **less structure doesn’t mean less productivity**.

Curious if anyone else feels the same: does simplifying your workflow actually make you more productive? Or maybe is the opposite: having a lot of constraints make you more productive.

This is my very basic setup in terms of habit tracker and note taking.

1ofugbt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ofugbt,I’ve 100%ed Z-A and it’s EASILY my favourite of the Switch era Pokémon games. Here’s my full thoughts,"TLDR: I love the game. Has quite a few issues but the fun overrides much of it. No story spoilers beyond characters and megas that appear.

This has been an insanely addictive experience. There’s been a lot of discourse about whether the game is good or bad, but the only opinion and experience that matters is yours. Enjoy the things you like, and keep exploring to find things better than what you don’t! I’ll sort out my thoughts into categories for convenience: visuals, gameplay, characters and megas.

**VISUALS**
Easily the most controversial part of the game. I honestly think it’s fine, the biggest lazy issue I found was poor texturing where windows clipped into perpendicular walls.

It’s already been discovered that the beta had actual 3D balconies and decals, so the work was put in. This means that the decision to remove it was in favour of performance and gameplay. Gameplay is a pretty important aspect that’s glossed over by many in this aspect. The game features rooftop traversal, and over 460 different hitbox sizes to consider (regular and alpha mons) for real-time battles that have free movement. This would’ve multiplied the interactive surfaces by tenfold than the usual street-level city game. Flat walls are an understandable compromise to minimise jankiness in this aspect. I appreciate the actual building textures for being pretty nice to make up for it. Nice shadows baked in, and good window lighting variety at night.

I personally think the devs don’t get enough credit for their work, but I’m not a defender of their weaknesses either. A game where you can freely swap between 230 “party members” who are fully animated, complete with emotive responses, sleep animations, and even inverse kinematics in some instances (Falinks on a staircase, also please take the time to listen to their steppy sounds, you won’t regret it) is INSANE. Many models have also been touched up, and colours more saturated. There’s no battle boundary either, you can straight up run away from Royale Battles by going far enough. The character models are also top-notch. I’ve noticed a lot more unique animations in this game compared to previous entries, and they’re a lot more fluid too. To me it screams of passionate devs, who are significantly hampered down by greedier higher-ups.

I don’t mind the size of the map either. As a huge fan of the Yakuza series, you can add so much to a small location, and this game is a good example of that. It’s pretty bold to have this right after the open world of SV too. The creative experimentation is welcome. Undeniably more would’ve been better, but I’m pleasantly surprised by how this city plays compared to my initial hesitation of the concept. I am a bit disappointed with the laziness of the visible area beyond the city though, some roads or rails, maybe even a town silhouette would’ve been nice.

**GAMEPLAY**
Gameplay is solid, bar a few frustrations. Everything just feels smooth, especially due to the cleaner transitions for battling. It’s interesting seeing how the traditional mechanics have been transferred, like the switching out turn penalty, speed stat, and stat buffing moves. Traversal is also great.

Pokemon has been really good with QoL improvements. The reintroduction of HM moves was implemented really well here, valuing a flexible range of moves to remove obstacles rather than specific ones. I’m also so thrilled that I can snipe an opponent and jump on them for once after over a decade of being jumped on… as a CHILD no less

The way shinies are handled in this game is awesome. Clear visual and audible markers, a safety net of ten shinies that remain spawned when spawned, and even higher catch rates for them than usual. The lack of auto-save removal is not intrusive either, which is a relief. The method of getting the shiny charm, while tedious, is not outright unfair when you consider the lengths it takes in other games. I’d recommend aiming to level up your Pokemon, rather than focusing on the specific battle count for that final Mable’s request, so it doesn’t feel as painful. Extreme Speed and Aerial Ace are also your friends here.

My four gripes for gameplay are: 
Moves that get blocked by terrain. Sometimes I think the real antagonist of this game are the lampposts and hedges. I would’ve even accepted a power penalty, so moves being weaker if they hit something else before hitting the opponent, but outright blocking them has been frustrating, especially when trying to sneak attack others.

The other is the forced day/night cycle transitions. I don’t mind it too much, since they took the effort to add multiple reminders. Shinies are also not reset by this (though time-exclusive ones are a bit jankier). The mini-map also includes a timer that visualises the time left around its perimeter. 

Mints and berries have no bulk buying. I’m gonna be AZ’s age by the time I get all the supplies I need. I’m pretty sure they did this on purpose to disincentivise players from viewing their Pokemon as purely stat machines to perfect, but surely there has to be a better way. I head canon this as a passive aggressive market strike for Kalos having a cheaper price on their stat raising items in the pokemarts compared to Paldea.

No Pokemon-care sidemode. Pokemon Amie was such a great addition in the original X & Y. But the Switch Era has largely underdeveloped this side of Pokemon. I was shocked to see that you couldn’t even interact with your following Pokemon with a button. While the coffee and bench moments are nice, the horizontal camera movement is really limited, and the character pose being stuck sitting stiff feels wanting too.

**CHARACTERS**
Definitely the highlight of this game for me. I LOVE this cast of characters, especially since the MZ group are older than the usual protags. There’s definitely a refreshing, more mature atmosphere to this game. Everyone’s drip is also immaculate across the board.

I actually didn’t like Canari and Jacinthe much at first, but as characters they’re GREAT. I don’t think they were designed to be immediately likeable. It gave them much depth and a character arc to invest in as the game went on.

My favourite is Corbeau. Dude is a true “businessman”, like a dragon, even.

I nice touch I noticed is that most of the significant opponents you battle are naturally paired as opposites on the type chart (ground/electric, steel/poison etc.).

Beyond the unique characters, even the basic NPCs here are a delight. So much charming, freaky, and immersive dialogue that’s surprisingly in-touch with the audience. Most cities in games don’t have this level of flavour text, so this was a nice addition.

The only disappointment here is the lack of characters from previous games to the extent of Arceus. Clemont is a pretty glaring one, but I admire their effort to make a largely original cast. The ones that do appear, like AZ and Mable, are more than welcome.

**MEGAS**
I literally love all the megas except for one: Pyroar. That said, I’d much rather hear why others enjoy mega Pyroar than go on about my dislikes at length. The same goes for the minor critiques I have for some of the other megas. The kanji flame motif doesn’t do it for me, but I do like the animation where it uses its mane as a whip. The shiny is pretty neat too!

Mega Starmie is beautiful. I like that the dev’s creativity goes beyond just looks. A lot of effort goes into their movement and personalities, which makes them a lot more interesting than the static images many people had a first impression of.

My favourite is mega Falinx as you might’ve guessed - my first ever shalpha too!!! Epic banana maltesers. I love their spherical existence. They are awesome. Little globs of attacc. The pinnacle of Arceus’s design fr.

I really love the separate megadex that they added for a convenient view of all the megas. Especially since you don’t need to actually mega evolve them individually to be viewable.

**STORY [MEGA MAJOR SPOILER]**
Croissant Curry is WILD, but I’d try it.

**CONCLUSION**
This game has a lot of parallels to the Yakuza series, which is all the more amusing when you reach *that* part of the game. I fashioned my character after Ichiban for the real Yakuza experience. As a fan of both series, this was a great blend of whimsy and action, emotion and silliness. I love the Legends entries for deviating from the formula, it’s refreshing, though needs a few tweaks.

It’s a testament to how well the Devs understand the core of Pokemon, being able to make something that can be so addicting despite the weaknesses it has. I just wish the higher ups could give them as much love as well, they could so easily be the best game company if they weren’t greedy.

I found myself sighing many times with the previous Switch Era games (still enjoyed them all plenty though), but Z-A was the first where I was genuinely engaged from start to finish. The steps they’ve taken to branch out is inspiring and welcome. I hope everyone else is able to enjoy the game as much as I have. And a huge thanks to anyone who took the time to read all of this!

Hey everyone,  
I’ve been working on a small side project called [Tivor](http://tivor.me), a **minimal note-taking app** that uses **Markdown and natural language** to automatically structure your ideas.

The goal is to make note-taking feel more like ***thinking out loud,*** you just write, and the app recognizes things like tasks, tags, moods, or habits without any extra setup.

No folders, no complex menus: just a continuous feed of your thoughts that you can filter later by tags or context.

Still early in development, but I’d love to hear your thoughts or ideas for features you’d actually use in a tool like this!",1,1761405703.0,noteapps,0,1.0,False

After more than several, (•﹏•`💨) covers & re-spins, the style, flow & the magic is not the same as my oopsie splice attempt—so I’m crossing my fingers that someone can help add a sound effect of ocean waves to fill the gap. 🌊 or another suggestion?

But during my recent visit to the store in Kolkata, I faced a shocking charge: I picked a pre-made cold sandwich, asked for it to be grilled/heated—and was told I’d have to pay extra just for grilling it. The customer-care team was unaware, and the store manager said they received a marketing directive.

This isn’t just a small oversight—it’s a clear example of hidden charges, poor internal communication and disrespect for customer loyalty.

It’s not about the amount. My overall order was far higher than this punitive “grilling” fee—what it reflects is greed, inefficiency, and a broken trust.

Since 2017 I’ve spent thousands on this brand: Gold membership an annual spend of ₹600, redeeming a “tall” coffee reward that often feels smaller than promised, birthday benefit still not delivering a venti coffee and food of choice.

If this isn’t fixed—in writing—immediately, the brand image will suffer irreversibly. I’m not seeking freebies, gift cards or sweet apologies. Just transparent policy, fair service and respect.

Local brands and competing brands are doing far better by being honest and customer-centric. Until Starbucks India gets its fundamentals right, expansion into Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities won’t change perception—it will only amplify the disappointment.",0,1761405313.0,india,10,0.33,False

Hi, I’m a teenage boy. Recently, I fell out with a girl I used to be close with. I’m also bi, but she and her mom know that for sure (at least I think so). After we stopped talking, everything was fine  we were just ignoring each other and moving on.

But a few days ago, her mom texted my mom asking to meet up for coffee. That might sound normal, but here’s the problem: I come from a very strict Muslim household where being bisexual is completely unacceptable. If my parents ever found out, there’s a very real chance I could be disowned or even kicked out. There aren’t any shelters or safe spaces in my city nor is there CPS (I don’t live in a first world country), so I honestly don’t know what I’d do if that happened.
Note* The ex friend has outed me to our whole year group (class of 70 people ) Because people where shipping us (still mad abt that caused a lot of bickering she ended the friendship on *her* side not mine so i don’t know how to feel abt that )

Now I’m panicking because I don’t know why her mom wants to meet mine. I keep imagining that she might bring up something about me or our friendship that could somehow “out” me. It’s making me feel sick and scared.

think I’m overreacting and that it’s probably just a harmless chat between moms, but I can’t shake the feeling that something bad could come out of this.

So, AITA for being this scared and anxious about it?",1,1761405186.0,AmItheAsshole,26,0.6,False

But the real issue for me is a specific bug I haven’t seen discussed much—wondering if others are hitting this too.

Certain food items that appear in many of my meals and recent history simply don’t show up in the app. For example, my custom recipe (“coffee with cream and sugar”) and even standard items like “Jumbo Egg – Trader Joe’s.”

Not only are they missing from the meal list, but they also don’t count toward daily calories. If I check the website, the entries and calorie totals are there, so clearly the data exists—it’s just not rendering in the app. (As a developer, my guess is some metadata is triggering an exception during parsing.)

My workaround has been to find alternate entries and update my pre-made meals, which is a pain. I reported this to support, but no real answers yet. Hoping this is a known issue at MFP and gets fixed in a future release.",1,1761405061.0,Myfitnesspal,0,1.0,False

It was right near a university, so there were often college kids in it. It would be a bit loud, but never too bad.

One day a group of white college girls sat down right next to me and started talking loudly. It was impossible to not hear their conversation.

It went something like this:

Girl 1: I can't believe that people are racist. It's crazy that they would judge a person based on their skin color.

Girl 2: It's absolutely ridiculous. I've dated guys from all races and they are all pretty much the same.

Girl 3: Yeah, I dated a black aries and a white aries one time and they were both so selfish! I'll never date an aries again.

Girl 2: Oh absolutely. Aries are the worst. I would never date an aries. I find that Libras are the best to date.

Girl 1: Really? I don't trust libras at all after my last boyfriend. He lied all the time!

The seamless transition from being baffled that someone would judge another based on their skin color, but then openly judge people based on what month they were born in, just was too hilarious for me to hold back. So I threw my hands up in their air with a laugh and said ""Oh come ON!"" They all stared at me like I was crazy, but they were a bit quieter after that.",109,1761405036.0,overheard,10,1.0,False

1oftxcs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oftxcs,I want to bump this up to the next level for 2026,"This setup has been really good to me this year. The screen and projector themselves are nothing spectacular, basic $100-$200 model no-name hardware that does a decent job. Really only good in the dark of night and I want more time in the sun.

Some ideas and requirements:

- I’d like to be out here with family and friends earlier in the day where it’s a little warmer. Think like Saturday and Sunday football games starting at 1pm or 4pm. 

- Ive got about a foot of clearance where the siding and the framing juts out where i could “easily” mount a pull-down solution. I can probably go to 100”-120” no problem. I’m not sure if mechanical is the way to go here VS pull down. It would be out here all year long more or less so I need it to survive the elements. Located in Massachusetts where we get all of the seasons.

- I’d like to be able to mount some speakers by the back door and by the bathroom window that you can kind of see on the right hand side. Not sure where I would put the receiver, could probably make space in the coffee bar that’s on the opposite side of the siding. Alternatively might also just get x2 Sonos Move 2s or something equivalent and figure out a place to mount them. 

- Not sure if a solution exists where I can build some sort of enclosement around the screen that “shields” the screen from sunlight, but I’m open to something like that if it would be helpful. 

As for the budget, I’m really not sure what this would cost me. I’d like to keep it around $3k if I can between all the new hardware. That might be too high or too low, idk. Open to all product recommendations that would meet these needs. Open to other ideas as well as long as they’re priced around the budget. If this is like a $5k solution lemme know if I’m nuts or not lol.

1oftwp2,https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHI4Er2W3N4&si=2Y86Yr0WbeTAx46a,Jura X10 - Single or Double Espresso?,"# ☕ What an Espresso Is

An **espresso** is a small, concentrated coffee made by forcing hot water (around 200°F) through finely ground coffee beans at high pressure (around 9 bars). This process extracts deep flavor, natural oils, and a layer of golden crema on top — the hallmark of a perfect espresso.

# ⚙️ How It’s Made

* Water is heated and pressurized.
* It’s forced through a tightly packed “puck” of coffee grounds (usually 18–20 grams for a double shot).
* The extraction takes about **25–30 seconds**, yielding a rich, aromatic coffee shot.

# 👥 Single vs. Double Espresso

* A **single espresso** uses \~9g of coffee and produces 1 ounce.
* A **double espresso (doppio)** uses \~18g and produces 2 ounces.

Most people today prefer **one double espresso** over two singles — it’s more consistent, has a fuller body, and better crema balance. Also, most modern commercial machines (like the Jura X10) are calibrated for doubles, ensuring better extraction and taste.

So, for quality and convenience — one **double espresso** wins almost every time.",1,1761404941.0,u_BreakCoffeeCo-SFL,0,1.0,False

I've already got a pretty solid collection going so far (Arkham Horror, Final Girl, Imperium series, Marvel Champions, Resist!, Under Falling Skies, and Witchcraft), but, to paraphrase Hunter S. Thompson, once you get locked into a serious board game collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. 

I would love everyone's help in guiding the next steps in my solo game journey. 

1) So I have some games I really want to get to the table. While I know that these may have solo versions, I was wondering if they are honestly fun and replayable. What are your thoughts on the solo versions of these games:

* 51st State
* Bloody Inn
* Endless Winter
* Great Western Trail (2nd Edition)
* Lost Ruins of Arnak
* Obsession
* Paleo 
* Paladins of the West Kingdom

2) What are some solo games/games with solid solo versions that I should look into? Coffee Roasters popped up on my radar, but it doesn't look like it has much replayability or variety in play. I was vibing some cozy, dice, and/or roll and write games; Fleet came to mind, but Deep Regrets (which is none of those) got stuck in my brain for some reason. How is Deep Regrets as a solo? I've also heard good things about GI Joe the Deckbuilding Game, but I'm all ears. I've heard good things about the Legacy of Yu, but I've also heard that you tend to follow the same pattern of play over and over in the game after a while to achieve success. 

3) I'm a history teacher, so both Anarchy and Hadrian's Wall came to mind. I'm really big on variety of play and replayability, so between Anarchy and Hadrian's Wall which one has the most variety and replayability? I also have Raiders of the North Sea on ioS, which is why I'm excluding Raiders of Scythia. ",4,1761404754.0,soloboardgaming,8,1.0,False

Then I moved to Thailand – a country where single-origin coffee with notes of strawberry and white rose is cheaper than supermarket blends. I started reading labels. Then longreads. And, God help me, I started asking baristas what water they use.

Somewhere in that process, coffee stopped being just coffee.

I learned which roasts I love, which notes I can’t stand, and how to make a better cup at home than in most cafés.

Like with wine – once you understand even a little, there’s less room for disappointment.

You can drink the most expensive coffee in the world and not know what you paid for. Or you can teach yourself to taste.

1oftnj7,https://v.redd.it/no08d59cv9xf1,Switched from scented candles to a herb-smelling ritual. It's a game-changer for my anxiety.,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a little upgrade I've made to my self-care routine that has genuinely transformed my wind-down time in the evenings.

Like many of you, I was a huge scented candle addict. But I started getting worried about the soot, the potential toxins in synthetic fragrances

I stumbled upon this ancient practice of using a gentle warmer to heat up natural herbs, resins, and spices. Guys, it's a whole different experience. It's not just about making the room smell good; it's a full-blown sensory ritual.

Here’s why I’m obsessed:

· 100% Natural: You're using pure, whole ingredients you can see – lavender, sage, frankincense, orange peel, cinnamon sticks. No hidden chemicals.
· The Ritual is the Point: The act of selecting my herbs, placing them in the little dish, and lighting the tea light candle underneath forces me to slow down and be intentional. It’s meditative.
· The Scent is Incredible: Unlike a candle's one-note scent, you can create infinite, complex aromas. Need to focus? Try rosemary and citrus. Need to unwind? Lavender and cedarwood.
· Healthier Air: Because you're not burning the herbs, just warming them, there's no smoke or harmful particulates. It feels much cleaner for my lungs and my home.

I use a simple, beautiful ceramic simmer pot with a little bowl on top for the herbs and a tea light candle underneath. Watching the heat gently release the natural oils... it's something a candle can't replicate.

Some of my favorite blends right now:

1. ""Forest Bathing"": Pine needles + a tiny piece of cedarwood + a single drop of eucalyptus oil (optional boost).
2. ""Cozy Café"": Crushed coffee beans + a cinnamon stick + a tiny scrape of nutmeg.
3. ""Sunshine Grove"": Dried orange slices + whole cloves + a small piece of vanilla bean.

My question to you:

Does anyone else here do this? I’d love to get some new blend ideas from the community! What are your favorite herbs or resins to use?

If you're curious about this, I'm happy to share more. Hope you all have a good day .",21,1761404337.0,candlemaking,7,0.82,False

So the light: it's really bright! I read before getting it that it can hurt their eyes and I will say that from sitting next to her while the light is on,  I can agree that it seems too intense to leave on for more than a couple hours a day. On that note I put something on her cage to filter the light so when she is in a part of the cage where she would be looking more directly to it it doesn't glare too harshly at  her. 

That said, she seems to enjoy it. I wait until she has ""had her coffee"" (ie: had a chance to adjust to waking up and the new day) before turning it on. And I turn it off in the afternoon so she can take her siesta. Sometimes I turn it on again for a couple hours in late afternoon just so she can see and enjoy colors.

I spoke with Jen Greenberg @greenbirdbrigade about lights and while she does not personally use them, she agreed that from what I told her about my bird's living area, it could use some ""brightening up"". She did not recommend an avian light per se, but just that perhaps a daylight spectrum bulb could be helpful.

I understand that UVB lights have a mixed reputation but I figured I would give it a shot, if for no other reason than I needed a lamp for the cage area and I want my girl to be able to see and possibly get vitamin d. I keep an eye on the amount of time it is on, because hell, it even hurts my eyes, so I don't want her little peepers to get burnt. Its not very comfortable to look directly at. 

But all in all, I'm glad I got it and I think she is too.",4,1761404290.0,Parrotlet,1,1.0,False

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction!

Full story...

A few years ago, my dog knocked a cup of coffee over onto my computer and the screen turned black. It wouldnt come on. It was the middle of the night, so i took it to a place to fix it. It was a good place, enough people recommend it and it wasnt expensive. They fixed it so the screen would turn on, but it wouldnt turn on unless it was plugged in. They didnt tell me this, i just found out when i got home and tried to use it. I didn't have time to go back (it was finals week in college) and when i finally had time, i just forgot and didnt have enough money if they tried to charge me again.

Fast forward, I haven't used it much because of always needing to be plugged in, and its needed a few updates for a while. Still works fine for most stuff, just some games are starting to get slow.

Now, i cant update the laptop because the ""battery is too low"" and I ""need to plug in my computer"", is what it tells me, but the computer is alway plugged because it won't turn on otherwise, except the computer doesn't register as being plugged in because the battery is basically always at 0% and just using exactly the charge it needs to run and none to save.

I have a Microsoft Surface Laptop 4. Its only 4yrs old, so i definitely dont want another yet.

Do you think it's fixable and maybe how much? Is there anything else I can do to update it without having to fix it? I haven't called the repair place yet, but i might when i have time / money to spair. I can only take it to one place to repair because it requires special tools to open and no one else around here has them.",1,1761404191.0,techsupport,1,1.0,False

Am I an idiot? A massive jerk? Monkeybranching?","I've been in a roommate-style marriage for a decade or so, married for over 20 years. Sex once a year or so, no affection, I tried to initiate both sex and normal intimacy for most of these years but about a year ago I was just done, a 10-20% percent rate at reciprocal (non-sexual, primarily) affection means 90-80% of the time I feel rejected and my self esteem is in the fucking gutter. I don't try anymore and to be honest I'm beyond wanting to have sex with her anymore. Why haven't I left? Two kids, our finances and retirement funds are all tied up in the house we live in, and we were both born and raised in the US and now live in a foreign country. An aging relative lives in a small apartment attached to the house. I'm frankly not sure how well my wife would manage without me financially and/or emotionally speaking. I'm not particularly happy in my job but I have these 4 people who's lives would likely be worse if I changed to a more fulfilling but lower paying job, or left my wife.

About 5 years ago I worked closely and on a daily basis with a married woman who I had a lot in common with and found very attractive but that was that. It was basically just the two of us in a small room all day for a few months. As is often the case in this situation you end up taking quite a bit about your personal life and you get to know each other pretty well. I enjoyed the time I spent working with her and that was that. There was no flirting, nothing that I wouldn't have done had she been a guy or a 70 year old woman that I connected with. We still occasionally run into each other for work, and we don't work at the same company anymore but our professional lives are pretty intertwined. We'd meet up every six months or so for lunch or a drink. We talked about our respective relationships and our issues. A year or so ago she separated from her husband.

Recently we met up after work, talked a bit about some projects we were working on. In the course of the conversation she told me that she had such a crush on me when we were working on together and how could I not have noticed, etc. I had no idea. I told her that I felt the same at the time.

Since then I was basically broken. I couldn't stop thinking about her, about what could have been...We both had to travel a bit for work and vacation after this and we weren't writing back forth or anything during that time. I was aware that I was likely blowing this all out of proportion in my head, and was frankly hoping that I was because it would be easier than the alternative. Last week we met for coffee and I basically told her how I felt and how conflicted I was. She basically said she felt the same and that she felt bad for sparking this. I assured her that whatever I decided I didn't want her to feel responsible for it, if I left my marriage and she decided that she wanted nothing to do with me, that's fine.

I tried to act as normal as possible during this time, my wife and I had our usual arguments, but one relatively minuscule thing was the final straw. She wrote a grocery shopping list as she often does, and I added about 10 things to the bottom of it (I cook more than half the time, for both the family and my work lunches). She cut the grocery list in half, and said she'd only get the stuff she wrote down because the other stuff is ""me"" stuff. I took both grocery lists and bought everything. It struck me that our marriage is really, really bad. My wonderful 16 year old told me she basically wishes we'd split up.

I'm aware of the fact that I could have headed this off much earlier. Talking about my relationship issues with her left me open to this. And the worst thing I did was not communicate more clearly and set my boundaries earlier before my marriage deteriorated to the point that it has. I also know that I'm high on the feeling of someone actually liking me and that my judgement is clouded, and that red flags will likely be ignored and before long this woman may very well be taking shits with the door open or express a desire to collect 27 cats or tell me about her side MLM business...I

Clearly my only option is telling my wife. I have zero desire for a physical affair. The problem is, I don't want to move past this and continue with the marriage. I have absolutely zero idea how she'll react",172,1761403471.0,relationship_advice,181,0.76,False

1oftadc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy_Universe/comments/1oftadc/queen_keppra/,Queen Keppra,"Setting: Caite’s house. Outside, the sky glows a sleepy purple. Inside, the living room looks like a toy store exploded. There’s crayons on the rug, a half-built Lego cathedral, and one small dragon trying to roast a marshmallow over a scented candle.

 

Caite kicks off her shoes and floats a few inches above the floor, rubbing her temples.

 

Caite: “Okay, mission parameters: pajamas, teeth, bed. Minimum collateral damage.”

 

Jeffy the Dragonboy, tail coiled neatly, chirps. He sneezes. A spark hits a couch pillow and it starts to smolder.

 

Jeffy: “Collateral damage achieved!”

 

Desdemona fresh from the garage, slaps it out with a rag.

 

Dez: “And that’s why we don’t mix dragons and synthetic scents they are allergic to.”

 

From the hallway bursts Princess Delaney, glitter-smeared, waving a cardboard wand.

 

Delaney: “Nonsense! Dragons and candles are part of my royal kingdom!”

 

Angel follows, carrying a laundry basket like a shield.

 

Angel: “Your kingdom is on fire again, Your Highness.”

 

Laughter ripples through the room. It’s chaos but the good kind. For a minute, it feels like family.

 

Then Desdemona freezes. Her smile flickers. She sets the rag down too hard.

 

Caite notices immediately.

 

Caite: “Dez? You okay?”

 

Dez: “Yeah, yeah. Just… the Keppra’s kicking weird today. Feels like my veins are sparkling and every sound’s a personal insult.”

 

Angel: “Uh-oh. Brace for impact!”

 

Delaney gasps.

 

Delaney: “It’s happening again!”

 

A shimmer crawls across Desdemona’s skin. Copper first, then violet. Her eyes flash gold. Her ponytail stands like a banner caught in invisible wind. The lights flicker. The air tastes like ozone and sarcasm.

 

Desdemona straightens to her full height, grabs a wrench like a scepter.

 

Dez, voice booming: “I AM QUEEN KEPPRA, RIGHTFUL SOVEREIGN OF ALL ELECTROLYTES! WHO DARES QUESTION MY MEDICATION SCHEDULE?”

 

Jeffy hides behind the couch, whispering,

 

Jeffy: “Mom turned into the sparkly lady again.”

 

Caite floats higher, trying not to laugh.

 

Caite: “Alright, Your Majesty, let’s use our coping protocol. Step one: hydration.”

 

Angel salutes with a juice box.

 

Angel: “Electrolyte tribute, m’lady!”

 

He tosses it; Queen Keppra catches it mid-air, suspicious.

 

Queen Keppra: “Is this… strawberry-banana? I DEMAND GRAPE!”

 

Caite: “It’s what the pantry kingdom could provide, Your Grace. Step two: deep breathing. Preferably not through fire.”

 

Jeffy kneels dramatically.

 

Jeffy: “I pledge loyalty to the Calm Kingdom!”

 

Delaney: “And I’ll rule over the snacks!”

 

Queen Keppra stares them down for one long, trembly second… then hiccups, the glow fading a little. Her voice cracks between regal and tired.

 

Dez: “You’re all ridiculous.”

 

Caite grins, lowering gently to the floor.

 

Caite: “That’s the point. Laughter lowers cortisol.”

 

Angel: “And cortisol fuels Keppra-rage. Science, baby.”

 

The last sparks fade into the air like glitter that forgot what drama was for.

 

Desdemona exhales, shoulders sagging.

 

Dez, quietly: “Sorry. Didn’t mean to go full monarchy on you.”

 

Caite: “Hey, you didn’t throw a single wrench this time. That’s progress.”

 

Delaney: “Can we still call you Queen sometimes?”

 

Dez: “Only if there’s cake involved.”

 

Jeffy perks up.

 

Jeffy: “Royal decree: bedtime cake?”

 

Angel: “Denied. But royal hot chocolate approved.”

 

They kids cheer.

 

They migrate toward the kitchen– a patchwork family– the glow of the stove painting halos where none are needed.

 

Desdemona leans against the counter, sipping cocoa, a small smile tugging at her lips.

 

Dez, voice soft: “You know, if this is my kingdom, I’ll keep it.”

 

Caite: “Long live the Queen.”

 

Angel: “Long live her pharmacy refills!”

 

Laughter fills the house again. Outside, the moon rises bright, steady, unjudging. While the heart of St. Somewhere hums with life and love, scars and sparks alike.

 

The chaos has settled into calm. The kids are in pajamas; Jeffy’s tail flicks in his sleep, and Delaney snores faintly under a blanket of glittery stars.

 

Caite floats just above the floor, tucking the covers around them like she’s wrapping the night itself. She glances toward the living room, where low lamplight spills across the couch.

 

There sits Desdemona, a cup of cold cocoa on the coffee table, her fingers still smudged with grease and guilt. Her shoulders slump, head resting in her hands.

 

Angel sits beside her, quiet, hands clasped. He doesn’t push. He just waits. Finally, Dez sighs. A long, cracked sound that lives somewhere between exhaustion and apology.

 

Dez: “Every time it happens, I tell myself I’ll see it coming. That I’ll breathe, count, take a walk, something. And every time… I turn into someone else.”

 

Her voice trembles: “I hate that look on their faces. The kids. Caite. Like they love me but don’t know who’s behind my eyes for a second.”

 

Angel: “You came back faster this time.”

 

Dez: “Doesn’t feel like much of a victory.”

 

He leans forward, elbows on his knees.

 

Angel: “You didn’t hurt anyone. You didn’t run. You let them help. That’s victory enough.”

 

Dez’s jaw tightens. She stares at her hands, strong hands, oil-stained, trembling now.

 

Dez: “I wish they didn’t have to help. I wish I didn’t keep scaring them.”

 

Caite’s voice drifts from the doorway, soft but steady: “You scare yourself, Dez. That’s the part we keep forgetting. We’re not the ones who wake up mid-rage wondering what the hell we just said. We’ve been there though.”

 

Dez looks up. Caite floats in, barefoot.

 

Caite: “You’re allowed to be tired. You’re allowed to be angry. You’re allowed to be human. None of that cancels out how much you love them.”

 

Dez swallows hard, eyes glassy.

 

“It’s just… guilt. It sits in your throat like bad coffee.”

 

Angel offers a small smile.

 

“Then maybe we just sip it together. Until it cools down.”

 

Caite drifts closer, lowering until her feet touch the rug. She wraps an arm around Dez’s shoulders.

 

Caite: “You’re not your medication. You’re not your seizures. You’re not Queen Keppra. You’re you. The one who built a rocketship that runs on sugar and love.”

 

Dez huffs a shaky laugh: “And duct tape.”

 

Caite smiles: “Mostly duct tape.”

 

The silence after that is soft, the kind that doesn’t need fixing.

 

From the hallway, a small voice murmurs, half-asleep.

 

Delaney: “Night, Queen Keppra.”

 

Dez smiles through her tears: “Night, Princess.”

 

She leans back against the couch, breathing slow, heavy, real. The crown may have slipped, but the love stayed.

 

Angel flicks the lamp lower, his voice is certain and kind: “Tomorrow’s another chance to feel okay again.”

 

Dez: “Yeah. Maybe I’ll even make it till lunch before the crown tilts.”

 

Caite: “We’ll be here to straighten it.”

 

They sit in companionable silence. Three souls in a living room built from resilience and leftover cocoa, letting the guilt settle into something gentler: grace.

 

Outside, the night hums with the steady rhythm of a heart that refuses to quit.

I had never experienced drowning until now.

Drowning is sinking to the bottom of an abyss, lungs squeezed of air. 

Even the simplest action of pushing the door open was agony. 

Dragging myself to the chair is agony. 

Admitting to myself that I need help is agony.

“Mrs. Redford,” the therapist says, standing from her chair and shaking my hands, her expression crumpled, eyebrows knotted with worry. “Thank you for coming.”

She offers me coffee, and I sharply shake my head. 

Vomit creeps up my throat. No. 

I can't drink. 

I can't eat. 

Not until I know I'm not crazy. 

“I'm okay,” I whisper. I'm not okay. I'm not fucking okay. I'm not okay. Somehow, my hands find hers, squeezing for dear life.

“I have two children. Rosie, and Ronan. They're nine years old—”

I'm doing it again. 

I'm struggling to picture them, even now.

Rosie. Brown eyes. Dark blonde hair and a wide, cheesy grin.

Ronan. Always scowling. Always having a tantrum. 

“Sit down, Ally.” The therapist soothes.

I do. 

She studies me with gentle eyes. “Ally, can you tell me how you feel right now?” 

“I can't find my babies,” I whisper.

I shake my head. “Listen to me. They were here, and then they were gone. They were here,” I wail, “and then… they were—”

“You feel sad.” The therapist says softly. “You feel numb, Ally. Your pain is justified. I’ve seen many women experience delusional belief after losing children.” 

She squeezes my hand. “But we're going to get you through this.” 

I jolt back. “What?”

She responds with a smile. “Ally, from what I believe, you miscarried your twins, and are currently experiencing what we call postpartum psychosis.” 

Her hands grip tighter, the stink of lavender tickling my nose.

I want to let go. 

I want to pull away! 

But it hits me. 

Grief. Agony.

I can hear my screaming, my sobbing, feel the sharp gush of warmth down my legs. The cradle I bought for them lying empty. 

I lost them.

I… lost them.

I don't realize I'm sobbing into her shoulder until she hands me a tissue. I lean back and swipe at my eyes. 

“Whenever you're ready to talk, Ally, I'll be here,” she says softly.

I nod. That's all I can do. I can't breathe. 

I stand up, my legs wobbling.

The door flies open, and two kids run through.

I freeze. The air stills.

“Mommy!” Rosie runs in, giggling.

Ronan follows, dragging his feet. He offers me a single look. 

I choke on my words. 

I try to hug my daughter, but she backs away, her eyes wide. 

“Rosie.” I manage to choke out. “Ronan!” 

The therapist laughs. “Ally, I think you’re misunderstood. These are *my* children.” 

She places her hands on Ronan’s shoulders. “Mrs Redford, you’re sick. Experiencing postpartum delusion. You *lost* your children.”

The boy holds my gaze for too long. 

I blink.

“Right,” I say.

“They’re not mine,” I tell myself.

“I’m *sick*.”",19,1761403302.0,shortscarystories,1,1.0,False

Song by Hazel O'Connor ‧ 1981

Overview
Lyrics
You drink your coffee and I sip my tea
And we're sitting here
Playing so cool
Thinking what will be, will be
But it's getting kind of late now
I wonder if you'll stay now
Stay now, stay now, stay now
Or will you just politely say goodnight?
I move a little closer to you
Not knowing quite what to do
And I'm feeling all fingers and thumbs
Spill my tea, oh, silly me
But it's getting kind of late now
I wonder if you'll stay now
Stay now, stay now, stay now
Or will you just politely say goodnight?
And then we touch
Much too much
This moment has been
Waiting for a long, long time
Makes me shiver, makes me quiver
This moment I'm so unsure
This moment I've waited for
Is it something you've been waiting for
Waiting for too?
Take off your eyes, bare your soul
Gather me to you and make me whole
Tell me your secrets, sing me the song
Sing it to me in the silent tongue
But it's getting kind of late now
I wonder if you'll stay now
Stay now, stay now, stay now
Or will you just politely say goodnight?

What am I?

I have known about MBTI for 5 years, and have really only studied Jungian’s ideas for one year. I have always struggled to get a grasp on what MBTI I could be, and even my friend who knows about psychology struggled to type me.

I have debated between the four INXX types (infj intj infp intp) for so long, and I need a bit more clarity so I can start to conclude what my type is.


I am someone who:
- gets nervous when texting someone something either emotionally or mentally vulnerable; I compensate by always leaving my do not disturb on, and when it’s off, I get nervous checking messages
- does not like picking up phone calls 
- talks to oneself
- not afraid with being loud or oversharing in front of family and close friends 
- had a new group of friends that told me they thought I was rude for the first three weeks they knew me, not sure why but maybe because I committed to so many plans and ended up forgetting or not wanting to go
- a bit clumsy sometimes as a result of being in my own head 
- likes surprises, but doesn’t like the attention & feeling of being deceived
- when talking with people, I tend to place focus on just me and them, which leads me to ignore surroundings
- often makes irrational compulsive decisions with minimal useful research
- gets annoyed when people speak about trivial and surface level stuff, only if it’s not something we both share in common and that can lead to an engaging conversation. 
- likes new things (ie. new mbti possibilities) but will stick with old things until I get the full value out of them (I listen to the same album non-stop for years at a time) 
- likes when things are clean but doesn’t like to put too much effort into cleaning it, will maintain the clean environment though
- loves music and expressing myself creatively (theater kid), singing songs with people I know very well but not with people I’m not so well acquainted with 
- wants to be different and authentic- has a bunch of talents like singing dancing playing guitar writing short stories rollerblading reading learning Korean etc
- but I hate sharing feelings with others externally; if a bunch of people are crying (bc of happy news) together, I will smile and be happy for them but I won’t be able to join in.
- hates when people are overly competitive because it unintentionally spreads to me & stresses me out
- likes the little things in life because they make the present life less dreadful (iced coffee in the mornings)
- if a schedule is made for a conference, concert, or any event and it is not followed, I get annoyed and impatient
- lives heavily in the future and often fantasizes about the coming weeks so I can get through my day
- has a few outcomes that can play out of college, but these outcomes are very stable options
-would rather have 4 close friends than 30 surface level friends
- doesn’t like high maintenance friendships
- only does things when I’m ready if it’s a big deal, and if I don’t have a time to decide, I’ll freeze
- has values, but also the type to read comments on a TikTok before making an internal decision on whether it’s funny or not
- procrastinates doing easy things that are boring and tedious rather than hard things that are engaging / waits until the very last second if it isn’t interesting or meaningful
- will get something done only if there are no external factors pressuring me — there’s nothing more I hate than unrealistic deadlines
- long hours spent thinking about myself deeply and what I am to my core / has struggled for years with my MBTI, since I’m someone who tends to see things very black and white, and I tend to resonate with all the functions
- hate when people disagree with my values and morals and values, but I try to bite my tongue and not argue too much
- just cares about the result — don’t tell me how you got there
- can not plan outfits for everyday 
- makes to do lists on the notes app and forgets about them immediately after, but still gets things done — I hate overly complicated apps for productivity
- get jealous when other people are prettier, smarter, or are unfairly given better opportunities than me BUT forces the envy to pass by distracting myself with other things
- will forget an appointment if I don’t put it in my schedule and set seven alarms to remind me, but otherwise, I am always half an hour early and never miss it
- when something happens I have to share it with someone else to get it off my chest
- cannot be a housewife, I need a purpose and I need to be someone making an impact in my everyday life (even though I want kids)
- not focused on the way I look externally to an EXTENT. (less than my ESFP brother and ESTP sister, but I still put in effort for myself)
- under stress, I can become hyper-focused on minor face blemishes or small physical inconsistencies, and it comes in outbursts
- Ideal world: I will have freedom/autonomy, financial stability, and I will have also made an impact in the world (find a cure for something or made a meaningful impact)

I am confused because I don’t know whether I have Fi and Te or Ti and Fe. I am also just unsure whether I employ Ne or Ni.

• Asian Baby Girls.  
• Sperm racing.  
• “Let’s do a coffee chat”   
• Those weird billboards.  
• Burnout being rebranded as a flow state

We want the hyper-specific stuff that insiders *feel*, but outsiders find hilarious.  
The tiny cultural quirks, the cult-like rituals, the inflated self-importance, the Patagonia vest politics, the open-plan existentialism.

Mindlessly tapping through stories and posts, feeling more like a spectator in other people's lives than a participant in your own? I've been there. My feed felt like a one-way street of curated photos and announcements. It wasn't *connecting*, it was just broadcasting.

The big shift for me was moving from **posting AT people to talking WITH people.** It sounds simple, but it changes everything. Instead of just showing my perfect cup of coffee, I started asking, ""What's the one thing getting you through this Monday?""

It's about making your corner of the internet a place for real, two-way conversation. Think about it:

*   Instead of a vacation photo dump, post one amazing picture and ask, **""What's the most incredible place you've ever visited?""**
*   Instead of just saying you finished a book, ask, **""What's a book that completely changed your perspective?""**
*   Run a silly poll. Share a small, relatable struggle. Ask for advice on something low-stakes.

Suddenly, ""engagement"" isn't about metrics anymore. It's about the DMs you get, the comment threads that turn into genuine conversations, and the feeling that you're actually building a community, not just an audience. You start to **connect on a human level**, beyond the highlight reel.

Of course, putting yourself out there and being more open can feel a bit vulnerable. It takes courage to move past the perfectly polished version of yourself, and honestly, managing the emotional side of being more authentic online is a skill in itself. Making sure I was in a good headspace was crucial for me. I've found that having a solid foundation for emotional management makes all the difference, and **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** has been a massive help in building that inner strength.

It's wild how turning your social media from a passive consumption habit into an active connection tool can totally re-energize how you feel about it. Your feed starts to reflect a real, breathing community.",1,1761402893.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

We got a bouquet at our door, and we were confused. No note at first, just flowers. I was scared that my gf sent them by mistake( my family doesn't know about us yet). But I was relieved when we found the card that read “For Mr. B.”

Then my dad explained. One of his workers had been juggling work and family(he's newly married), barely taking a break, and my dad had quietly arranged for a subscription box that included snacks, coffee, little desk gadgets which will be delivered to their home for a month, just to make their days easier. The bouquet was part of his little gesture of care towards his employees.

My dad is in his 50s, runs a successful paper production business, keeps things professional and is quite strict with us at home. This took me by surprise actually. He is arranging the flowers in the kitchen vase right now. Felt a little proud of him, I wish to get a boss like him.

1ofszh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmilyHenry/comments/1ofszh7/just_finished_all_her_books_spoilers_do_not_read/,Just finished all her books (SPOILERS: Do not read review if you don't want spoilers!),"This is gonna be long. For context, I read PWMOV and Beach Read several years ago and felt meh towards them.....even DNF'd Beach Read initially. Well, I just finished it last night and let me say.....I don't know how 2020 me didn't like it. As I write this, I feel like an EmHen FMC typing away with her coffee on a beautiful, sunny morning:

  
**Book I read first: PWMOV, 4/10**

Picked it up sometime during the pandemic; never really read much romance. I was at a point in my life where I loved a good friends to lovers trope. Now I think I prefer enemies to lovers (thanks, romantasy) or rivals to friends to lovers. I found Poppy to be annoying, but I did think the story between her and Alex was cute and had a good ending. The plastic sheet rain balcony s\*x was.....interesting.

**Book I read second (excluding Beach Read for now): Happy Place, 2/10**

I DNF'd. I know this is widely regarded as everyone's least favorite, and I can see why. Maybe I'll give it another chance because I loved some of her other books so much, but I just can't with the fiancés breaking up and getting back together on a trip with their friends. Sorry not sorry. Also, what kind of a name is Wyn?

  
**Book I read third: Funny Story, 10/10**

Let's fast forward to 2025. I decide to give EmHen a try again for the summer. Oh. My. God. I see why this is a favorite. At first, I was like, ""Ugh, jaded exes pretending to date to piss off the other people? This can't go well."" WRONG. 

Miles is perhaps the greatest MMC of all time. What a realistic, relatable, sweet guy. We've all fallen for the ""not textbook hot"", questionable career, quiet guy (okay, maybe just me) at some point in our lives. HE IS JUST SO SWEET. Daphne is also my favorite FMC of all the gals in these books. I find the starting over after a jaded love theme very relatable (granted, this appears in multiple books) and I also found her to be the least whiny of EH's FMCs. I loved the friendship she formed with Ashley. I loved the way she found herself and decided to stay in the town on her own terms.

When Miles brings her to his favorite beach....holy shit. Their moment in the water. Their moment at the red light on the way home when he takes her hand (side bar: these kinds of moments>>>>>spice any day). What they do in the kitchen when they get home. GAWD. My only, only qualm was that the whole helping Petra move and semi-ghosting towards the end was weird and unnecessary. But I guess EH needed her third act conflict. Anyway, cue ""You Are in Love"" and ""Labyrinth"" by the great Taylor Swift.

  
**Book I read fourth: Book Lovers, 6/10**

Ok, so at this point, I'm hooked on EH and want to keep reading her other books. I heard if you liked Funny Story, you'd really like Book Lovers, too. I disagree; they aren't too similar to me - if anything, Beach Read is way more similar. Like many, I found an adult exclusively calling her sister, ""Sissy"" to be very annoying. I recognize that Nora's horrible work life balance is relatable to many, so I'm glad EH wrote about that. I felt like Charlie was introduced as this big meanie and ice lord, but he cracked and was down bad in like....2 minutes. I liked that the sisters formed a great relationship with members of the community. Lying about moving there (and really, the sister's whole plot) was weird. I loved how Nora finally broke down towards the end and ran to Charlie (classic romance) and he was so supportive. I did find it odd that they didn't speak at ALL when she moved back to NY, and then he just showed up months later. Like come on guys, you could have figured this out.

  
**Book I read fifth: GBBL, 8/10**

This one was hard to get into at first. I did not enjoy the two Taylor Jenkins Reid novels I read, so I was like, ""Ugh"" at first when I saw where it was going. However, I think it's great that EH decided to do something a little different. I really enjoyed Alice as an FMC (although, I feel like I read multiple summery romances this year that had an FMC named Alice....maybe let's think of a new name, authors...lol). My husband and I have had conversations about how we sometimes see the world differently, and how he admires the wonder/childlike awe I still have. Sometimes I feel a little ashamed or naive about that, but when Hayden tells Alice he would love to see the world through her eyes, it reminded me of myself and my husband! :')

As a southerner, the descriptions of Georgia were a little off. It is definitely not tropical on the islands there, and I felt like I was reading about the Keys at times, especially with the hotel name lol. Maybe that's just me, though. 

Hayden is probably the simpiest MMC EmHen has written. Sometimes I loved it; sometimes I felt like it was insta-love. Overall, I loved Alice and Hayden together (gotta love Grumpy x Sunshine). Their s\*x scene towards the end was honestly really hot. I also loved when she brought him to her mom's cottage - I kept picturing a Nancy Meyers-esque setting with the garden and the home cooked meals in the kitchen.

  
**Book I read sixth: Beach Read, 9/10**

Truly do not know why I DNF'd this in 2020. I could not put it down. Gus is like a more hardened, slightly less ""sweet"" version of Miles (clearly I have a type lol). I honestly hate his name (also...Jacques and Gus??? The mice from Cinderella?) but I could not care less because this man is so hot. 

At first, I was put off by January. Someone just posted about the amount of drinking in Beach Read, and while I agree that it's ultimately no big deal, my initial impression of J was that she was an alcoholic since she brought multiple handles of gin and started drinking from the bottle. But then it got better. January was a great FMC- very, VERY relatable as someone who lost a parent young. Wanting to know more about them that you never got to hear, wondering ""why"" to so many things, all of the grief that never goes away, and THOSE LETTERS....I cried. But, I do think the dad sucks for having the affair.

Let's get into the romance: The Olive Garden scene. Wtf. So perfect. So sweet. I hope everyone gets to experience that ""teehee, we are being cute and like each other and are trying to ignore it even though we are adults"" feeling. I thought that captured it perfectly. Later, when January goes down to the beach to cry, I KNEW HE WAS GONNA BE THERE WHEN SHE TURNED AROUND MWAHAHAHA. Adorable depiction of our boy trying to be vulnerable and make our girl feel comfortable with him. Next....the drive in! Cute! And then we have a super slow burn that I absolutely loved leading up to the basement scene....that was \*chef's kiss\*!! What I loved the most (other than Olive Garden) was when they went to Pete and Maggie's house and Gus started showing them that he and January were a thing, and he and January both felt so comfortable and happy! And then, the love confession in the lake right after!!!! OH MY GOD. I think that was my favorite ""I love you"" in all her books.

Ok, and then the conflict ensued. I found it very relatable when January was freaking out and chiding herself for falling too hard because she doesn't do casual relationships. But it's not casual! He loves her! He needs to hurry up his divorce though and not get a drink with his ex (??? felt unnecessary and like Petra 2.0). I love, love, LOVED how Gus was able to open up and not be afraid with January. Also, the notes across the windows to each other........I like to think he wrote the ""Marry Me"" note back then and not a year later when he proposed. :')

  
Ok, that's it! Feel free to chime in thoughts- but as always, be nice! :)

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

So firstly I’m not conservative and I’m not from the USA anyway and I am not religious the way I am is my own personal choice and how I have wanted to live my Life. I’m not intending to offend anyone at all I would ask those to be respectful towards me don’t report this post if you don’t like it im a very decent man I know what I want in life and I want to find a decent woman! If I don’t appeal to you please just move on! 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents! 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 35 hanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv.

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly not showing too much off with revealing clothing. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!",0,1761402574.0,IntrovertDating,1,0.5,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Nebraska Cornhuskers vs. Northwestern Wildcats: A Statistical Sausage Fest**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a gridiron clash that’s as statistically convoluted as a tax auditor’s coffee order. The Nebraska Cornhuskers (5-2) host the Northwestern Wildcats (5-2) in a Big Ten showdown where the numbers tell a story of defensive grit, offensive groans, and a spread that’s tighter than a deflated football at a beach party.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

Let’s start with the cold, hard math. Nebraska is favored by 7.5 points, per the consensus of bookmakers, with moneyline odds hovering around **Nebraska -750** (implied probability: \~88.5%) and **Northwestern +550** (\~64.7%). Wait, what? Those numbers don’t add up to 100%—thanks to the vigorish, which is basically the sportsbook’s version of a tip jar. But here’s the kicker: Nebraska’s implied probability is absurdly high for a team that’s **0-4 against the spread in Big Ten games** under Matt Rhule. Meanwhile, Northwestern, despite scoring just 22.7 PPG (100th in FBS), has covered the spread in two of their last three meetings with Nebraska.

The VSiN analytics team thinks the line should be Nebraska -4.5, not -7.5—a 3-point discrepancy that screams “value” for Wildcats backers. Why? Because Nebraska’s offense is a statistical joke on the ground (104th in rushing, 125 YPG) and Northwestern’s defense is a brick wall (11th in FBS, 15.1 PPG allowed). If Nebraska can’t run the ball (and they can’t—imagine their offense is a tortoise in a sprint), they’ll have to throw it against a Wildcats pass defense that allows just 168.6 YPG (18th-best). But here’s the rub: Nebraska’s passing offense isn’t exactly Aaron Rodgers in a tuxedo—they’re 17th in passing (291 YPG), but their defense is elite at **123 YPG allowed** (1st in FBS). It’s a numbers tug-of-war.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Trends, and Why Nebraska’s QB Looks Like a One-Trick Pony

No major injury reports here, but let’s lean into the absurdities. Nebraska’s rushing attack is so anemic, they’d need a time machine to score a touchdown without the pass. Their star back, Emmett Johnson, has 713 yards, but tha

So I did a half hearted elimination diet. Removed dairy, eggs, gluten and processed sugars. I was eating meat, veg and rice for dinner and leftovers for lunch. It was hard - especially not having dessert after dinner! 

3 days in - I had almost no eczema. So I decided to reintroduce things (yes this is not the right approach I know!!). I started with eggs, I had egg for breakfast for 2 days and no change, the eczema continued to improve. Then I brought in some gluten - I did limit it though, to one slice of bread per day and pasta every now and then and oats. Hands were fine. Then I started having milk in my coffee, and , started having dessert. Well eczema returned. Not sure if it’s just the dairy or the sugar but both seem to be closely linked. 

This may not be the cause of everyone’s eczema but I wanted to post this in case you’re at your wits end and wanted to try something new. See what happens! ",4,1761402478.0,eczema,5,0.7,False

So I have a coworker (Alex) who's been going out of her way to make me feel uncomfortable and unwelcomed at work. I don't think it's reached hostile levels but it's getting there. 

The reason why she's mad at me in the first place is because I talked to the manager about something she did three times that affected my job. I had even talked to Alex before going to the manager and she did it again. 

I'm not sure what happened on her end but I'm pretty sure she didn't even get in any real trouble. But ever since then she's been the equivalent of a highschool mean girl. 

Doing things like bumping into my shoulder on purpose, spreading rumors, doing coffee runs and offering to buy drinks for everyone but me. And at first I just rolled my eyes and moved on, I'm an adult, if she wants to act like a child fine. 

But it's gotten to a point where it seems like she's trying to get me in trouble. She lied to me about a meeting time and I almost missed it, I would have too if it wasn't for the fact that I have time anxiety and show up to places super early. In fact she seemed shocked that I was there. 

Now, my main issue is that Alex is the resident favorite. You know the person who's friends with everyone. Seen as super outgoing, charming, and everyone loves them. Literally the moment a new person arrives Alex pounces to showering them in compliments even offering to cook for them. 

I don't know how I go about talking to my manager with how Alex seems to get away with things being so likeable. 

The only advantages I have are that my managers do seem to like me based upon my work ethic and I've never once been in trouble while Alex has in the past. 

My main worry in this, is not Alex not stopping. It's me talking to the manager, nothing happening, AND Alex finding out resulting in things getting worse.

I’ve helped a few folks here in this community on their individual posts. I read all of the stories and so many are sad while I think some of them are just trolling just to get a rise out of folks.  Anyway, I felt compelled to give someone $25.00 as I was speaking with a client of mine today (I’m an event/meeting planner) and she was telling me how she will randomly pay for someone’s coffee, meal or grocery items when “the spirit hits her”.  It’s her way of “giving back to those who need a pick me up as you never know what they are going through and any act of kindness can brighten up their day”.

What she said moved me so that’s why I’m going to randomly pick someone to receive this small blessing. It’s not much but hopefully it can put a smile on someone’s face.  I’m currently at work so I won’t be able to pick anyone until I get home this evening.  Also, please make sure you have Venmo. And for the love of God - PLEASE DO NOT DM ME.

I tend to drink a lot of soda, specifically non sugar caffeinated in the morning (don’t drink coffee) and non caffeinated non sugar sodas in the afternoon and evening. Royal Caribbean was great for me with the coke freestyle machines with all of the options. Never sailed with Princess.

My questions are:
1. Anyone know the soda options for fountain drinks?
2. Do they serve the fountain drinks in like a 12oz glass?
3. Will they fill your own tumbler that you provide?
4. With the premium plus, can you request cans instead of fountain?
5. Does anyone know the can choices? 

I know it sounds asinine with already having the premium plus package, but if the fountain selection is limited and I can’t get cans with the premium plus, I was thinking of also adding the soda package to get cans instead. Anyone know if there’s a limit to the number of cans each day?

I appreciate the time of anyone that responds.

The correct way of saying it should be ""she work**s** hard"" or ""he like**s** coffee"". If your subject is **he, she, or it**, always add **-s** to the verb and this is what we call subject verb agreement where the subject must correctly match the verb in number.

Today is Saturday, and I decided to go to the local bakery this AM to get some pastries for the fam. It was 49 degrees out- not freezing, but not exactly room temperature either. I put on some jeans (it's Saturday, duh), trainers, a cotton sweater and a light jacket. When I got to the pastry place- it has its own parking lot- most people there were wearing t-shirts and shorts only. On their feet? I am not even exagerrating, slippers, though to be fair some were slides, but some were actually slippers. And get this, some were leaving their car running the whole time they were waiting in line in the shop to get their pastries. 

I think there's nothing terribly abnormal about this, by modern US standards. but it still prompted a ""back in my day"" grumble to myself. My mother would never let me outside on a day like today without long pants and at least a warm shirt. And in my 20s and 30s, being a college student and then what you might call a sort of granola kind of guy, biking everywhere, growing a garden etc- I think I still would have thrown on a poncho. 

I went to my favorite coffee place and had to walk around a group of young men in their slides transfixed by their phones. not one gesture from them at all. I had to say ""pardon me"" and wake them from their spells just to get to the door.

Then it occurred to me the pattern I was seeing everywhere: people today are manifestly unprepared for anything out of the ordinary, for anything remotely resembling an urgent situation. 

People I saw on this trip reminded me of HG Wells The Time Machine. Like a bunch of clueless Eloi milling about, unable to do anything of moderate difficulty. I wondered if I posed such an analogy to any of them, would they even get it? I doubt anyone I encoutered today even read books, let alone a moldy oldie like Wells.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

So firstly I’m not conservative and I’m not from the USA anyway and I am not religious the way I am is my own personal choice and how I have wanted to live my Life. I’m not intending to offend anyone at all I would ask those to be respectful towards me don’t report this post if you don’t like it im a very decent man I know what I want in life and I want to find a decent woman! If I don’t appeal to you please just move on! 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents! 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 35 hanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv.

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly not showing too much off with revealing clothing. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women

We used and loved the Spinn 1 for 2 1/2 years until it died. My wife is technologically challenged and needs the easy of just pushing a button to get her coffee. We don’t need milk drinks.
I’ve been researching for a while and it seems that the Jura E4 may be the way to go. I’ve also checked out the Delonghi’s, specifically the Magnifica Evo with the wand (without the auto milk frother) and the Dinamica Plus model. Another idea would be to try the Terra Kaffe TK-02 (yes, I know that it’s overkill) because of the ease of use. We could rent it for a month or 2 to see if it works for us.  It seems like the logical successor to the Spinn.
So, our requirements are: which makes the best regular coffee, can produce hot water for tea, is easy to use , and easy to maintain?  Budget is up to $2,000.  We live in the US. Thanks for your input!",1,1761401899.0,superautomatic,4,1.0,False

BYU is famously associated with the LDS church, who frowns on the consumption of alcohol. So there is a stereotype about Cougar fans drinking chocolate milk instead of booze. It may be low hanging fruit, but what self respecting dude can resist the opportunity at a White Russian riff?

* 1 oz Monkey Shoulder Blended Scotch

* 2 oz Heavy Cream

Stir all ingredients (except the cream) with ice. Strain into chilled rocks glass. Pour the heavy cream over a spoon to layer it, or mix it in like a filthy animal.

Location: Joint Refueling Point, South of Kalayaan

The rain fell in sheets, turning the deck into a mirror of steel and sky. The joint refueling point between the UAC and Brunei’s maritime patrol was supposed to be a simple exchange. It became something else entirely.

Commander Siti Rahmah of the KDB Al-Amin was known for her precision every word measured, every gesture deliberate. She stepped onto the temporary pontoon bridge, clipboard in hand, to meet Lt. Ramos, UAC logistics officer from Balangay Two. Both wore the same expression: exhaustion hidden behind formality.

“Your logs say we split the remaining fuel fifty-fifty,” Rahmah began.
Ramos checked his notes, sighing. “Our records say the same, Commander. Which means either we both get half or both get none.”

A beat of silence. Then, somewhere behind them, a mechanic dropped a wrench, and both crews burst into laughter. The tension cracked like thunder.

As the storm worsened, their men and women took shelter together beneath a makeshift tarp. Bruneian sailors poured instant coffee; Filipino welders shared sardines and biscuits. Soon, they weren’t negotiating they were swapping stories: of families left in Bandar Seri Begawan, of islands saved in Palawan, of faith that kept them moving when radios failed.

When a damaged fuel line on Al-Amin ruptured mid-rain, both crews rushed to fix it. No one gave orders they just moved. Ramos handed tools, Rahmah steadied the pipe, and sparks flew as welders sealed the breach.

By dawn, the repair was done. The tanker floated steady, its engines humming like a pulse reborn. Rahmah wiped her hands and nodded to Ramos.

“Seems we’ve made our agreement,” she said.
Ramos grinned. “No signatures needed.”

Before departing, both crews painted a mark on the refueling dock a simple emblem of crossed wrenches beneath two stars. It would later be known throughout the fleet as The Brunei Exchange Mark the unofficial symbol of alliance by labor, not law.
