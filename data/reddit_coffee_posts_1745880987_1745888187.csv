I've been losing weight pretty steadily over the past year-- walking anywhere from 12,000-20,000 steps a day usually on the higher end-- and eating in a calorie deficit-- around 1000 calories or less per day. I've dropped a lot of weight and felt a lot better. But, since February, I haven't been able to lose any weight. I'm stuck at 170lbs (started at 245lbs). I've been trying to eat better because my diet before wasn't great-- so my meals contain a lot of vegetables and protein-- but regardless of what I do I just can't seem to lose any more. My legs are always sore because of how much I'm walking. I'm drinking so much water. I just don't understand. Sometimes I'll have like a couple pieces of candy but it's not like I'm going crazy. I don't drink soda or anything like that. What am I doing wrong? I can't do high intensity exercise because I'm hyper extensive and anything like that can cause massive problems. I lift weights every day-- not a lot but enough to feel it. I'd think I was building muscle but I don't feel like my physique has changed like at all. What am I doing wrong? 

When I make my dinner I'll use carbs as a carrier because I have arfid-- like I'll grab a pack of ramen and then absolutely load it with vegetables-- to the point that I only end up eating like half the packet of ramen with the food. Without something like noodles or rice I literally won't eat it. If I have breakfast it's usually a small packet of beef jerky. I don't drink coffee or tea.

<div>### Creative Ways to Incorporate Vintage Tool Boxes into Your Home

Using vintage tool box decor ideas is an excellent way to add a rustic, industrial charm to any space. These timeless pieces offer both functionality and aesthetic appeal, perfectly blending nostalgia with modern design. Whether displayed on shelves or repurposed as furniture, vintage tool boxes bring character and warmth.

### Unique Display Options to Elevate Your Vintage Tool Box Collection

One popular approach to vintage tool box decor ideas is to use them as stacked storage units. This adds height and interest to any room while keeping clutter at bay. Another creative option is converting a weathered tool box into a planter for succulents or herbs, bringing greenery indoors with a touch of industrial flair.

### Incorporating Vintage Tool Boxes into Different Rooms

Vintage tool boxes are versatile and can suit various environments. In the living room, they serve as side tables or storage ottomans. In the kitchen, they provide an eye-catching storage solution for utensils or linens. Using vintage tool boxes in a home office enhances organization with style, neatly housing stationery and craft supplies.

### Maintaining the Authentic Vintage Look

To maximize the vintage appeal, avoid over-sanding or repainting your tool box. Preserving the original patina showcases its history and charm. Adding leather handles or metal labels can further accentuate the rustic aesthetic, blending seamlessly with farmhouse or industrial-inspired interiors.

- Repurpose as stylish storage for books or magazines
- Transform into a unique coffee table centerpiece
- Use as decorative shelving for small art pieces
- Combine multiple boxes to create modular furniture
 
Embracing vintage tool box decor ideas invites creativity and individuality into home design, turning overlooked storage into statement pieces filled with personality.

1kabh8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/thehostingmindset/comments/1kabh8j/my_thoughts_on_the_ninja_specialty_coffee_maker/,My Thoughts on the Ninja Specialty Coffee Maker (Honest Review),"Hey everyone,  
I recently got the **Ninja Specialty Coffee Maker** (model CM401), and I thought I'd share my experience in case anyone else is thinking about getting one.

**Overall impression:**  
I'm honestly really impressed. It brews strong, flavorful coffee and has a lot of versatility without being overly complicated. You don't need pods (huge plus for me), and it can make everything from a regular cup to more concentrated ""specialty brew"" shots for lattes, macchiatos, etc. It even has a fold-away frother for milk.

**What I like:**

* **Brew Options:** You can choose from classic brew, rich brew, over ice, or specialty concentrate.
* **Serving Sizes:** Full carafe, half carafe, travel mug size, regular cup — it's easy to adjust.
* **Frother:** It’s built-in and works with both hot and cold milk. It folds away when not in use.
* **No Pods:** You use your own ground coffee, so it's cheaper and better for the environment.
* **Easy to Clean:** Parts are dishwasher-safe and it's pretty straightforward to rinse out the basket and reservoir.

**Minor downsides:**

* It’s not tiny — definitely bigger than a single-serve machine.
* The water reservoir is plastic, not glass.
* No built-in grinder (not a dealbreaker for me, but something to know).

**Final Verdict:**  
If you're looking for a coffee maker that gives you café-style drinks at home without needing a ton of gadgets, I definitely recommend it. It’s a solid machine, especially for the price compared to full espresso setups.

Has anyone else tried it? Would love to hear if you have any tips for specialty drinks!

Hey coffee lovers,  
I just wanted to share my experience with the **Ninja Specialty Coffee Maker (CM401)** that my boyfriend gifted me this past Christmas. As someone who takes their coffee seriously, I’ve been a loyal moka pot user for years, but this machine has completely changed my morning routine.

# What I love:

* **Brew Variety:** You can brew classic, rich, over ice, or specialty coffee. It’s like having a mini coffee shop in your kitchen.
* **Size Options:** From a single cup to a full 10-cup carafe, it’s perfect whether you're flying solo or hosting a coffee-fueled gathering.
* **No Pods Needed:** You can use your own coffee grounds, which is great for both your wallet and the environment.
* **Easy to Clean:** Most parts are dishwasher-safe, so it’s quick to clean up after your morning brew.

# The one flaw:

* **Time-Setting Buttons:** I swear, setting the time on this thing is like trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube. A simple dial would’ve saved a lot of frustration.

**Pros:**   
✔ Brew Style Variety  
✔ Multiple Serving Sizes  
✔ No Pods Needed  
✔ Removable Reservoir  
✔ Easy to Clean

**Cons:**  
 ✘ Time-Setting Buttons are a nightmare  
✘ No Warming Plate Timer  
✘ Bulky Design (takes up counter space)

Despite the frustrating time-setting buttons, I’m absolutely in love with this machine. If you’re looking for a versatile coffee maker that can handle hot, iced, and specialty drinks, I highly recommend it.

Rating: 4.5/5 (half a star off for the button-induced rage!) ☕⚔

And in true “forever alone” fashion—with a dash of optimism—I made my own dating site to help break the cycle.

I’m big into conventions, video games, horror, and cosplay (think Resident Evil, Stranger Things, and Silent Hill vibes). Outside the costume life, I clean up well and have a pretty solid fashion sense. I also like working out and staying healthy, and for a weird but fun hobby—I enter sweepstakes… and weirdly win them more often than not.

What I’m looking for is someone to geek out with, maybe travel or cosplay with (not a must), and hopefully build something long-term. But if you’re local, just meeting for coffee and good conversation would be an awesome start.

Can’t post my site link here, but if you’re curious, it’s on my profile. And yes, that is me as Eddie Munson from Stranger Things:

1kabfb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/onlychildPH/comments/1kabfb1/is_it_an_only_child_thing/,IS IT AN ONLY CHILD THING,"Hello everyone, I'm new in this subreddit but been roughly seven months in reddit. So, I have this officemate, she's also an only child. We talk paminsan-minsan sa office and just yesterday she invited me to have some coffee and donuts. We talk about anything under the sun and I have found out that we are schoolmates way back elementary and high-school. I just don't know why hindi kami nagkakasalubong sa school noon. Haha


So, yun na nga we talked everything and anything. She opened up about her relationship status and she said I could relate to her since I'm also an only child. We are both in our 30s, I'm 31 and she's 30 right now. Her parents are opposed to her 'suitor' since he doesn't have any work daw and he's younger than her, the guy is 27y/o,  I didn't mention that I know the guy since we have a common friend. What hurt her daw was being called desperada and malandi since she will make patol daw sa mas bata sa kanya. And her mother mentioned that mas okay na lang na wag na siyang magkaboyfriend or asawa if she will be the breadwinner of the relationship and maybe she's destined to just take care of her parents when they are old.

I told her that her parents had a point na huwag siyang kumuha ng bato naipupukpok sa ulo niya since where will the guy will get the money for necessities or example they'll go on a date? She will for sure make gastos but I also told her that she's not desparada or malandi just because she fell for a guy who is younger than her and its a cultural thing lang siguro na 'dapat' matanda yung lalaki sa babae but isn't that not a requirement to fall in love and regarding sa destined sya na mag-alaga sya mama's papa niya, yes Filipino as we are, we tend to take care of our family especially our parents but it is also a human need to feel intimacy and feeling loved by another.

Maybe we have different views lang but I think her parents are just looking out for her since she's an only child.",1,1745887684.0,onlychildPH,0,1.0,False

1kabe1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kabe1m/my_fiancé_is_defending_his_female_coworkerfriend/,My fiancé is defending his female coworker/friend after she disrespected me and our relationship. Am I overreacting?,"I (24F) and my fiancé (27M) have been together for 5 years and have 3 kids. For context, my fiancé used to be close friends with a guy we’ll call “Jack”, but they’re no longer friends due to unrelated reasons this happened a few months ago. Jack’s girlfriend, “April”, works at the same store as my fiancé (different departments). Over the past year, they grew really close—to the point where my fiancé called her his ""closest friend"" alongside Jack.  

I tried hard to befriend April (since she has no female friends and everyone thought we’d get along), but she showed zero interest. That’s fine, but here’s where things get messy:  

- They’d hang out alone, get high together, and he’d vent about our relationship issues to her.  
- He’d drive her to work, spend lunches/breaks with her, and treat her like a ""guy friend,"" but it made me uncomfortable.  
- When I brought it up, he dismissed me, saying I was just being insecure.  

A few months ago, April finally came over for coffee (for the first time in the 4-5 years of knowing her). While talking about how we both have forms of OCD/anxiety(I’m pretty open about this, having intrusive thoughts), she told me my fiancé had shared something *extremely* private about me (something only he should know) while high, comparing me to other women. I was shocked—partly didn’t believe her, partly thought it was weird she’d bring this up our first time hanging out and given the context of our conversation. 

When I confronted my fiancé, he was furious and denied it, calling it a lie. I trust him 100%. He texted Jack (before they stopped being friends) to talk to him about it, as his friend. Once April found out, she sent my fiancé a bizarre message essentially saying:  
- I made it up.  
- Saying she ""didn’t remember"" our conversation (even though it was recent).  
- Getting mad at him for believing me instead of talking to her first before anyone else. 
- was upset with him for siding with me. 

He didn’t answer her text but wanted me to message her to ""clear the air."" I did—politely asking why she thought I lied and trying to resolve things and gave her my recollection of the conversation to potentially clear up any sort of misunderstandings (to which I was so certain it wasn’t but in the off chance, ya know?). Her reply? A barrage of character attacks, deflection, and victim mentality. I didn’t respond.  

Later, my fiancé admitted he’d been ""completely oblivious"" to April’s behavior. To which he then told me had:  
- Flirted with him (said he was way better looking than Jack, she thinks he’s the best looking man in the room m, and that she said to him her sister thought he was attractive, etc.).  
- Relied on him emotionally like a boyfriend (venting, validation, rides to work when they led often have the same shift hours, being cavalier with his time while he is waiting for her to get off work).  
- A coworker even said *they* looked/interacted like a better couple than her and Jack.  

He finally acknowledged it was inappropriate, apologized for being blind to it, and cut ties with her (since he and Jack weren’t friends anymore anyway).  

Here’s the issue now:
He removed Jack from Facebook recently but *not* April. His reasoning? ""She did nothing wrong."" Meanwhile, she:  
- Lied about what he said (or he lied about sharing private info).  
- Disrespected me and our relationship.  
- Had an inappropriate dynamic with him.  
- was oddly two faced toward me

It felt like a slap in the face. Worse, he’d still defend her in conversations, calling her a ""great person"" he ""respects so much."" After weeks of frustration, I went on his phone (we have an open policy but I’ve never done this before) and removed her.  

I admit that wasn’t my best move, and I’ve apologized. He’s forgiven me but is *still* upset I removed her, insisting he ""has no problem with her."" Meanwhile, if roles were reversed and I kept a male friend who disrespected *him*, he’d lose his mind.  

**Am I wrong for feeling disrespected?** He’s holding a double standard, and I don’t know how to move forward.  ",4,1745887574.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

Tried coffee subscriptions at several shops – some worked, others nearly caused mutiny. Here’s how to do it right:

① Price it so you (and your staff) win:

Tier 1: Base plan → Monthly drinks + food discounts

Tier 2: Premium → Free bakery treats, early access to new drinks

🚫 NO unlimited plans on labor-heavy drinks (looking at you, 6x/day oat latte guy)

Pro move: Let customers add a barista tip at checkout. Suddenly they’ll care about staff happiness.

② Set guardrails against chaos:

Daily drink cap → Stops “I need 5 caramel macchiatos daily guy!”

“Early Bird Bonus” → Free flavor syrup for visiting before/after peak rush

Gamify it:

“Bring a coworker? Free cookie 🍪” (office groups = free marketing)

“Use a reusable cup 3x? Mystery pastry on us 🥐”

③ Tech that doesn’t suck:
Your system should:

Require ZERO apps/downloads (QR code signup → 10 seconds)

Auto-send reminders like “We could not charge your card” ☕

Offer to cancel any time. (Nobody wants to be bound to a subcription)

Auto-add tips to barista paychecks (no awkward begging)

Barista bait (so they’ll actually sell it):

Share 5-10% of sub revenue with staff → They’ll pitch subs harder than pumpkin spice in August

Ban time-sink drinks (goodbye, 7-step mochas)

VIP pickup lane → Subs skip lines, normies get FOMO

How to launch by tomorrow:

Use HoneySub (handles subs, QR codes, tips, Google reviews, and local ads)

Print a QR code sign: “Skip the Line – Coffee Club Members Only”

Train staff to say: “Subs fund our holiday bonus – wanna help?” 😉

Result? Regulars who tip better, happier baristas, and you’re not losing money to Karen’s 4pm iced matcha emergency.

I will return and become the heiress of the Crowhurst pack,” I said, hanging up. The weight of it hit me, but it was the only way forward.
Before I could move, eight-year-old Corvin hurled a pot of boiling coffee at me.
“How dare you wear my mother’s dress!” The scalding pain hit me like fire.
“You can never replace my mother! You killed her with your jealousy and now you wear her dress like it’s yours!”
A maid rushed in, gasping. “I’m so sorry, Miss Ravenna. Corvin ran off again.”
I didn’t speak. My wolf’s rage simmered, then died, leaving numb defeat. That dress had been mine—my mother’s parting gift—until Rachael claimed it like she had everything else. But Rachael had taken it, just like she had taken everything else from me.
Eight years ago, I was supposed to marry Alpha Riven Grimsbane, the Alpha who was once my childhood sweetheart, the one I thought I’d build a life with. But it all shattered when he chose Rachael over me. She was the one who carried his bloodline forward, and their son, Corvin, became the focus of all their attention. But Rachael died during childbirth, and I was blamed for it, accused of killing her out of jealousy.
As the only sister of the deceased, I had been forced to stay in their home and care for Corvin. I had been instructed by my stepmother to treat him as my own son. But the role I was given felt like a cage—no love, no respect, just the cruel reminder that my place was never as anything more than a mere servant.
For eight years, I poured everything into Corvin, raised him, loved him, but nothing ever changed. Alpha Riven never loved me. He was a wolf who had chosen his pack over me, his mate over his promise. I had been a fool to believe otherwise.
But the truth was clear now. I had no place in this house except as a discarded concubine. Every action from Alpha Riven, every word from Corvin, reminded me of my insignificant position in their lives.
But today was different. 
Today, Corvin turned eight years old. 
And today, I was leaving. 
Alpha Riven’s gaze landed on my ruined dress, and he sighed.
“I heard what Corvin did. Don’t take it to heart,” Alpha Riven said, his voice soft. “He’s still just a boy, and he does care about you.”
“Eight years, Lucian. Our agreement ends today.” I said, my voice hard. 
“I’m leaving. I’m done.”
""Don't be stubborn. He's a good kid. I told him to come apologize.""
When no one else was around, a small hand tugged at my skirt. I turned to see Corvin standing there, an angelic smile on his face, holding a small, neatly wrapped box. “I’m sorry, Ravenna. I brought you a gift.”
The stench hit me before I fully opened it - my beloved cat, stiff with rigor mortis, an arrow piercing its side.
“That will be you, if you don’t leave me and my father alone,” Corvin said, his voice dripping with sick amusement, his eyes gleaming with a chilling intent.
I was mortified staring at my only pet Fifi that I had been allowed to bring to the pack mansion nestled deep in Bloodpine Forest, the ancestral land of the Moonclaw Pack. The same way I have taken care of Corvin.
“Don’t mess with me and don’t get my father upset with me!” Corvin snapped, his wolf aura flickering in his eyes, golden like his father's.
That night, I didn’t sleep. Instead, I packed my bags, my mind haunted by the image of Fifi.
Morning came sooner than expected, and after a quick shower, I dragged my suitcases outside.
It was finally happening. I was leaving.
A slow clap echoed through the courtyard, followed by a familiar, mocking voice.
“Well, well, well,” Kiera’s shadowed voice cut through the early dawn fog. She leaned against the stone pillar of the eastern gate. “Have you finally come to your senses?”
I sighed. Kiera, my Alpha Riven’s mistress, always knew when to strike with her venomous charm. Corvin adored her. She never let me forget it.
I ignored her and kept walking, but she stepped into my path, tilting her head in amusement.
“Eight years, Ravenna,” she continued, crossing her arms. “Eight years of playing house, of waiting for an Alpha who never claimed you. And now, after all that time, you’re finally leaving.” She chuckled. “Took you long enough to realize that Alpha Riven and Corvin will never love you. You’ve been nothing but a worthless concubine.”
I met her gaze, my expression unreadable. “Enjoy it, then,” I said simply. “Do whatever you want. None of this concerns me anymore.”
Her smirk widened. “Oh, I will. Don’t worry,” she whispered. “Soon, I’ll move in and take your place.”
Before I could respond, the front doors swung open.
Alpha Riven stepped out, followed closely by Corvin.
And in an instant, Kiera’s entire demeanor changed.
She gasped dramatically and dropped to her knees, clutching the hem of my coat as if her life depended on it.
“Ravenna, please!” she sobbed, her voice thick with desperation. “Please don’t go! Corvin needs you! You’ve been taking care of him all these years—how could you just leave him like this?”
I stared down at her blankly.
“Corvin loves you, he really does,” she continued, her voice cracking. “He’s just a child! Please, don’t leave him. I’m so sorry for everything, just please, Ravenna—”
Alpha Riven let out a harsh sigh, his patience clearly worn thin.
“Enough of this nonsense,” he snapped. “Stop creating a scene and go back inside.” His eyes were cold, as they always were. “I’ll get you another cat if you want. Stop making Kiera stress herself.”
I clenched my fists, but before I could say anything, Corvin ran toward Kiera, throwing his arms around her.
“Stand up, Kiera,” he said softly, his small hands wiping away her fake tears. Then, his gaze turned to me, filled with pure hatred.
“You killed my mother with your wicked heart,” he spat. “And now you’re trying to hurt Kiera, too!”
Corvin turned back to her, his voice gentle. “Don’t cry, Kiera. Don’t worry. Papa, let Ravenna go. I don’t want her in my life. I don’t need her.” He lifted his chin, his next words slicing through me like a blade. “I want you to stay. You should be my mother. You should marry my father.”
He turned back to me, his expression filled with nothing but contempt.
I swallowed the lump in my throat, taking one last look at the boy I had raised, the boy I had loved as my own.
“After eight years, if this is what you think of me… then there really is no point in me staying,” I murmured.
Without another word, I turned and walked away.
Just as I reached the gate, I heard the unmistakable twang of a crossbow being fired.
""Don’t think that putting on a pitiful act will make me accept you as my new Luna!""
""If you’re leaving, then leave for good! Don’t ever return to this territory!""
Corvin's roar—half-voice, half-growl—cut through the air like a blade, sharp with rejection and rage.
The arrow he released from his training bow shimmered with residual moonlight. I barely moved fast enough. It still nicked my shoulder, sinking into flesh. A guttural cry tore from my throat.
Alpha Riven was by my side in seconds, his scent—oak and iron—wrapping around me as he held me upright.
""I’m so sorry, Ravenna,"" he whispered, voice thick with guilt.
But the moment was shattered by shrieks. Kiera was crying. 
“Papa, Aunty Kiera twisted her ankle while trying to help that witch!” Corvin’s voice rang with urgency, but beneath it, I heard the sick satisfaction he tried to hide. 
Alpha Riven’s eyes flicked between us. His jaw clenched. And then, just like always, he turned from me.
“It’s a clean wound,” he said, not meeting my gaze. “Ravenna, go to the hospital. I’ll come after. I need to help Kiera—she can’t walk.”
I didn’t say a word. I didn’t have to. Pain was my language now.
He lifted Kiera into his arms like she weighed nothing—like I had once—and carried her toward the waiting vehicle. Her smirk was the last thing I saw before the car vanished into the forested driveway, with Corvin seated proudly beside her.
I remained there, slumped in a puddle of blood and betrayal—shot by the very boy I’d trained in archery under the moonlight, taught to steady his paws and focus his breath.
And just like that, they were gone. 
I let out a slow, shuddering breath, pressing a trembling hand to my wound. Blood seeped through my fingers, warm and slick. 
The boy I had raised. The boy I had taught to shoot. He had turned his weapon on me. 
Fate, it seemed, had never been on my side. 
Pain flared through my shoulder as I stumbled, barely managing to stay upright. My vision blurred, but I refused to fall. 
I gathered my bags, blood seeping through my dress, staining my fingers, my skin. 
“You’ll regret this,” I swore, my voice shaking with fury. 
A sleek black car rolled to a stop in front of the estate. The driver stepped out,""Miss Crowhurst, I’m here to take you home.""
……
“Ravenna, child... is your decision final?” my grandmother asked gently.
I nodded.  “I’ve accepted what needs to be done. If bonding with this wolf secures my claim as Luna heir and protects our bloodline, then I won't hesitate.”
“You’ll inherit full control of the Crowhurst pack after the ritual,” my grandfather confirmed.
I smiled.
Because now, it was time for payback.
But then he hesitated.
“There’s something else.”
“What is it?” Unease crept in.
“The man you’re marrying... Alpha Caelum Greenbrook... he’s Riven’s half-brother.”
“His greatest enemy.”
The words hung like thunder.
I curled my fingers around the chair, breathing in slowly.
Then I looked up.
“Very well,” I whispered.

We were in the same faculty so the chat mainly surrounded our sub-interests within the area.

While I had their contact and have texted them since the event, they've not responded a lot to my questions - mainly passive answering and shorter talks (better than one-word responses or left on read I guess).

I took a shot at trying to get them out for coffee again, under the reason of continuing our conversation (without much hope given their response on text) but they surprisingly agreed immediately for a cup of coffee in a few days and reserved 2 hours for it. (Should I have not said that...)

I'd like to know more about them, their hobbies and parts of daily life etc. but I'm afraid that they would be taken aback, perhaps because they were assuming that we would be talking about our interests in the field. I haven't asked them that much through text as I don't think they'd answer in detail anyways.

I don't want to invade too much into their private space and sound creepy. What are some good ways I can try and test the waters - see whether they'd be interested in me as a person - or they're just looking for ""career advice"" or ""interest discussions""?

Appreciate the help!",1,1745887306.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

[Final Part]","[Previous Part](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k96w4y/my_childhood_nightmares_came_back_this_time_i/)

  
Last night was not what I had hoped.

I drifted to sleep, blindly hoping that I would wake up having freed myself of the terror. Instead, I found myself back in the cemetery. Again, the dream took on a new form.

*I am there, staring at the swelling black curtains, only inches away from me. After hours of agonizing fear I feel the invisible hand wrap around my throat once again. It squeezes tightly—my breathing turns desperate. Through choked breaths, I plead to be let go but the hand does not concede. My throat collapses all over again, slowly and dutifully submitting to the hand’s strength. I cough violently, feeling as though I will hack up my organs if it goes on for a moment longer. As I beg with half-formed words, the darkness becomes more alive than ever before.*

*The buzzing sound grows tremendously loud; the noise, formerly indistinct, now takes shape. The vibrations of the hidden insects become a conduit for something much more human—humming the theme song of Little House on the Prairie. Nostalgia curdles in my stomach as the melody begins to drift subtly off-pitch, paired with an almost imperceptible increase of the tempo. Layered on top of the buzzing and humming, a voice forms from the dark, delivering jumbled phrases, as if a broken tape recorder is spitting out disjointed words—a cheap mimicry of human speech.*



*“For eternity… I don’t want—want—want—want to leave, I don’t. I DON’T. NO, NO, NO–For eternity? Come in here, buddy—I, what? What? Turn it back on, please. I need it back.”*



*The chopped-up mutterings come from a deep male voice—nearly indistinguishable from my father’s.*

*The disembodied voice switches tone; I hear a female voice, far more coherently replicated than the previous imitation.*



*“Hello? Joseph, can you please take a sho—oh! Sorry boys, I didn’t realize you were asleep—it’s early, but Angie misses you both, so get up…”*



*Again I hear the stammering, staticky voice of my father.*



*“She’s coming really soon—look up at the treeeeees, aren’t they soooooooooooooooooooo tall?”*



*Synapses fire in recognition of that phrase. Where do I remember that from? The wretched voice continues to distort his words, half-howling while maintaining a sinisterly coy delivery. The words come to me as though invisible lips were pressing to my ear.*



*“Look up… please—JJ, WHERE ARE YOUUUUUUUU? I WANT TO SEE YOUUUU? I’M UP IN MY BEDROOM, I MISSS— I… I miss you, I really do…”*



*I hear his voice much more clearly, just before it returns to incoherent babbling. I lose track of it, swallowed whole by the raging storm of creatures waiting to pounce.*

*I look up to the tops of the trees, swaying my broken neck. I stare in awe of their height until, suddenly, the curtains fall.*

*A swarm of insects rushes forth. The air is now unbelievably humid, far more capable of ushering forth the putrid stench of rot–it’s so thick that I can taste it, almost as dew drops on my tongue. I try to shut my mouth, but–for the first time–I feel a second hand. Settling two fingertips on my face, one on either side of my jaw, it squeezes tighter and tighter. Suddenly it rips downward, dislocating my jaw with a sound that seemed closer to a crack of thunder.*

*Now hung open, I could no longer fight the stench nor the insects. Feeling my throat fill with tiny, squirming bugs, I give in. After a near eternity, all sounds halt and I open my eyes to see a figure in front of me, slowly emerging as the insects disperse in every direction.*

*In complete silence, like an old movie scene, I see the bugs, now filling the sky–my head bobs back. In a momentary glimpse I am only able to notice a pair of eyes, wide open and entirely unmoving—the plastic eyes of a doll, loosely nestled within deep sockets. As my limp neck bounces back, I stare down at the dirty and battered arms of suit jacket bridging the gap between the figure and myself. With one final tilt of my head, I see white liquid, foaming from between a pair of chapped lips—contorted into a smile. Shadows obscure nearly every other detail, but the figure seems to be ready.*

*Before it can emerge I choke out one last cough, spewing a chunk of saliva-covered insects with it–entirely depleted of air, I black out.*

*--*

When I woke up I was relieved to feel that my throat was no more bruised than it had been the past few nights, though a horrendous, bitter taste overwhelmed it that I can only compare to arsenic nasal drip. I went to the sink to wash my mouth, then noticed that I could not hear the running water–the buzzing still rang in my ears. Gently, and without any inclination as to why I was doing it, I began to wrap my hands around my throat. The tender skin ached as I squeezed down; my subconscious unable to protect me from choking myself–I wasn’t even sure if I was the one moving my hands. The shower curtain in my childhood bathroom had been gone for years, replaced by a glass door, which was actually quite a relief to me as it got rid of that monster’s hiding spot.

Then, I hear the window slide up, cautiously I guide my eyes over, the only thing I still have control of.

The face of the man from my nightmare cartoonishly pops through the window; its expression made of gleering eyes and a half-witted smile. My hands grow tighter around my neck–my trachea threatens to crumble at any moment.

Involuntarily I turn, only slightly, towards the window. Now, rather than being able to see it in the mirror, it is several feet to my back left, only slightly accessible in the corner of my vision. I fail entirely as I strain to turn my head and gain clear sight of the watchful eyes.  The image in the corner of my view is nothing more than a blur, but I can make out its grotesque movement as I stand, entirely still and suffocating to death. These thoughts feel relatively unimportant, though, as I see the creature slide down, through the window and out of sight. I can hear its suit buttons clatter against the floor tiles, growing closer.

After so many run-ins with these impossible situations, I was capable of deciphering dreams from reality; unfortunately, I knew I was awake. Despite my every wish, I knew what was coming and prayed that my lack of genuine rest had sent me into a hallucination.

If I am able to move, my body would collapse in reaction to the next feeling; my back, muscles–tight in anticipation of the being behind me–become immediately flaccid as I felt a wet, scratchy face press timidly against my lower back. Patiently, it slides up my spine, careful not to come any closer than necessary, only letting the prickly hairs deliver a fluid onto my back–I’m forced to imagine it was pouring from between gritted teeth and an unbearable smile. When it reaches the top of my spine my tears begin to pour; its crusted lips brush against the nape of my neck, scratching as they find their way up to my ear. Upon arrival, the figure holds its mouth at such a distance so that the flaky skin would only tickle my earlobes. The lips part like a dam opening the floodgates–ushering forward a humid breath that dampens my cheek and earlobe. The breath carries forth an equally unpleasant smell, one I have come to know quite well. Even through my collapsing throat it is enough to make me wretch. I hear a shaky whisper–its trembling was a consequence of stifling laughter;

*“Yooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu…Don’t you get curious sometimes? Ever wonder how it felt for him?” Breathily, now, as if it were excited, “Try it, you know you want to…I’ve been trying to show you how good it feels. JJ, I think you’ll really, really like it…it was good enough for him to forget about you, wasn’t it? Rememberrrrrr, JJ. I’ll let you see my face if you–”*

The figure lets out several low, raspy, crackling coughs; immediately following this he begins to release a childlike giggle in my ear, the sound bubbles and screeches like an overflowing pot of boiling water as it grows more emphatic. The desperate, wheezing laughter begins to morph into the drone of millions of flies. They desperately pour from his throat, filling up the bathroom. As my vision becomes clouded, the bathroom shrinks into a few patches of light that will soon be filled by flies. As I hold onto the last bit of light my hands release slightly, now only barely aggravating my fuschia bruises. A wave of relief rushes over me, yet I remain unable to move my own body.

Presumably in reaction to my new-found freedom, the monster’s hands begin to shift towards my stomach. As if imitating a spider’s jumpy movement, the monster taps its fingers like legs, crawling up the sides of my stomach, through my armpits, up my neck and under my ears–and then it reaches my face. 

The fingers–with their horrid, unkempt nails and calloused skin–smell sickly-sweet. Rotten.

They linger against my cheeks for a moment before brushing away my tears. Comfortingly, the hands rustle my hair, then guided my head gently towards the mirror. I can only make out its hollowed, sunken doll eyes before I feel the hand begin to push the back of my head. 

With a slow but incredibly assertive force the hand pushes my head towards the mirror. My forehead reaches it first, the hand now pressing forward with the patient, damning strength of a hydraulic press. The flies are so densely packed by now that they cushion my forehead’s contact against the mirror, but my fleshy pillow of insect bodies is quickly pulverized under the pressure, leaving behind an impressive amount of bodily fluid to drip down my face. As it continues to push me onward, the hand grips so tightly it feels as though my brain is swelling far beyond the capacity of its shell.

I begin to shiver uncontrollably; the hand seems to suck the warmth from me. In the haze I started to feel the glass press into my skin, splintering under the pressure. Slowly, and with absolutely no hope to change the situation, I realize that this is where I will die. Cursed, likely from my birth, my hands have been bound to leave me defenseless against this monster–my legs have been forced to walk towards this inevitable fate. 

The moments before my head shatters through the mirror and my throat splits open against the glass are agonizing–the splintering of the glass worsens dramatically with each second. The hand takes as long as it can to draw out my demise.

Time drags as each crack in the glass finds its way into my skin, peeling apart my face and burrowing deeper. My eyes are next–splinters begin to scrape away at my eyelids, but the mirror is at its breaking point–I pray that I’ll be lucky enough to only suffer cuts on my eyelids before death. Instead, a number of broken shards slide from my brow, lubricated by my blood, and fall into the sockets. In an instant the barrier between the internals of my eye and the outside world is violated. It was a simple realization; a soft pop in each eye, and then the feeling of liquid rushing forth. 

When stabbed anywhere else one does not feel the absence of space–only the severe pain of the wound–but this is different. The searing pain seems to reach past my eyeballs, grinding against the bone of my eye sockets. Worse though, is the feeling of emptiness, maybe best compared to the acute awareness of the empty space left when a tooth falls out–one does not have to touch the area to realize there is a hole in their flesh, the feeling is constantly there. 



*And then, snap.*



My skull finds its way through the mirror–my neck is thrust into the shattered remains along the frame, almost entirely severed. It takes a moment for me to realize that I remain somehow, regrettably, alive. Upon having this realization I feel my hair yanked backwards. Then a familiar sensation arrives–my head flops sideways, as if only attached by a rubber band. Through the swarm of flies’ violent noise I hear its voice again, hissing:



*“I just want you to have what you need, why not let go? Are you that much of a fucking pussy? You know you want to, so grow a pair, you waste of cum. Let. the. Fuck. go.”*



Satisfied with its message, it disappeared, dropping me to the floor. My body became my own again and I, without hesitation, reached up to feel my eyes–they were still there, fully intact. At my side lay a shard of glass, draped in red. In the remains of the mirror–to my shock, it really was broken–I saw a skin-deep cut parallel to my hairline, with countless other gashes across my entire face. I grabbed the bloodied piece with my right hand, immediately flinching upon gripping it–carved into palm were cuts as well; perfectly, they matched the edges of the shard, a self-inflicted wound.

A million thoughts rushed through my head; more than anything, I was eager to dismiss this as another of my hallucinations, or rather, a psychotic break. I would have had every reason to do so–no matter how real they feel, I have proven myself incredibly capable of weaving dreams and reality so effectively that I could never really differentiate, but I was bothered by an entirely different revelation. Fighting from the deep recesses of my mind, the thought occurred; did *it* really have to kill me with its own hands? Has it ever even tried? It was clear to me that there was something more–the loss of a parent is a tragedy, but how could it lead to *this*? There were two possibilities; either I was truly, irrevocably insane, or the beast of my dreams was fully capable of controlling my body, and was using it to lead me to my death. The former would explain everything, only failing on a few minor accounts; primarily, the origin of my madness. As a child I was troubled, but I moved on. And, not to forget, those markings on my throat–how could bruises from hands so giant be self-inflicted? 

I had to find out what “it” was and how it ever came to be. I could not have imagined how terrible the answer would be, even though the answers were so clear all along.



*I denied it, I had to.*

\--

  
Before I even realized what I was doing I had begun driving to the cemetery, this would be my first time back since that day that has plagued my life. My legs moved themselves, walking me down the same path that I had so many years ago. My hand felt the tightening grip of my mother’s; I heard the echoes of my baby sister’s cries and laughter; I stared at the many aged gravestones, although far more were now softened–nothing more than markers for long-forgotten loved ones who selfishly left the world behind.

When I got to his plot, I didn’t even glance at his gravestone. Instead, I stared at that same coastal sky, obscured by what I had to believe were the exact same foreboding clouds. Maybe it was the fact that the scene was identical, but it was only now that I realized that exactly eighteen years had passed since the invisible hand began to beckon me into the gaps between the trees. In that moment, though, the pines looked far smaller than I remembered. Their curtains had fallen revealing a truth so obvious that I began to laugh–the woods simply went on.



I thought; “Of course, I always knew that they were just woods, and that the trees were just trees. Somehow I had convinced myself that there had to be more, but there could never have been unbelievably dark curtains draped between the trees, or any unknown, desperate creatures, or a ridiculous invisible hand.”



And for a brief moment I felt truly comforted in that belief, but then I wondered if it was even possible for my subconscious to have led me back here, on the same exact day; or for the weather to perfectly match my memory. Maybe I suffered psychosomatic symptoms as a child, but what about the blood on my head, or the buzzing that continued to echo in my ears. As I looked back towards the trees, I questioned if I had simply imagined them as being smaller–at the very same instant, they began to stretch towards the sky in front of me, and the woods beyond slowly dissipated into tangled, moving shadows. The sound of buzzing grew oppressively loud, and my breath became shallow.



I cried out, “YOU’RE NOT REAL, YOU CAN’T BE. HE’S DEAD SO JUST LET ME GO–” but I stopped myself, overcome by the thought: 



*Why did my voice have to sound so much like his?*



I thought back to the time without dreams, to the many years of calm, uninterrupted sleep. I wished desperately to return to that time. Unwittingly, I had begun squeezing my eyes shut so tightly it hurt. 



When I opened them I saw my fathers face–the same sunken, hollow expression that I had seen buried in his shadowy room–now dimly lit in the blackness below the trees. His eyes flickered up towards me, fighting to stay open. 



He smiled. 



I smiled back.



I asked him why he left; his face softened, now a look of loving concern.



I heard his voice, gently assuring me,



*“You already know why, don’t you? I love you, JJ, for eternity. Now please come closer, I want to see your face. I need to hold you.”*



I begged him to leave the woods, to come to me.

Abruptly, the figure jolted forward. His spindly arms preceded him–I watched as the stretched appendages jumped between physical states like two reels of film projected on top of one another. In one, its arms slowly coiled up and unfurled–snapping the bones and grinding them against each other. In the other, his forearms jutted to unfeasible angles, far beyond the limits of the elbows. The sound of bones cracking filled the air, but they were not simply breaking–they were adjusting themselves. 

Before revealing anymore of itself, the entity decided on a form that was suitable; the splintered realities aligned as the arms snapped into place, now they hung limply at his sides, spindly and unwieldy. At the ends of its newly formed arms, fingers jittered back and forth on distended hands, entirely too large for even his body. His eyes, though… they were human. They were Dad’s.



*“JJ?”* his shadowy smile grew larger.



*“You look so handsome, just like your old man…”* his voice was cooing, warm. It carried the same raspy, calming inflection I knew so well–the voice I longed to hear again.



*“Please… let me get a closer look, you know my eyes were never the best without my specs. I just–I really missed you.”*



I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, “Dad? Dad, what is wrong with you? Are you okay? How are you even here?”



*“What, you think I wouldn’t say goodbye? To my boy, my baby? You–you think I didn’t know I’d be here? I never really left, I couldn’t leave you behind. My boy… just come here, how many times do I have to ask?”* Uttering the last few words, his smile dimmed.



“Daddy, I can’t–why can’t you just come closer? You aren’t acting right. I missed you, too–” my voice sounded so young, so frightened.



The first tear fell from my eye, stinging the cuts that covered my face. In the pain came memories of those impossible hands, the years of suffering they inflicted on me. For a brief, pathetic moment I believed him–in spite of everything, I wanted to. 



I drew back, and in exchange he took a step forward–seemingly aware of my new found distrust.

I began to make out his face more clearly: a bubbling, white liquid dripped down his chin from a familiar smile, softening his scruffy five o’clock shadow. 



*“Do you remember how much I love you? Why don’t you just–JJ are you listening? Can you hear me? Can you just, please, listen to me for one goddamn second?”*



I took another step back, and again, he came closer. My body reacted, my hands covering the bruised skin of my throat.



*“I am telling you. You–LISTEN–you need to come here, right now.”*



I revolted, his fingers were no longer twitching–they reached, curling and uncurling, as if feeling for something. As if waiting for a turn.



*“I am DONE playing this game with you. I have waited, and waited, and–YOU KEPT ME AROUND, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?”* As he barked at me, his voice began to falter–it would briefly slip into a register far deeper than my father’s, crackling from his hoarse throat.



Whimpering, I released the few words I could muster, “Please, *please*–just leave me alone. For once in my life I want to sleep, I want to forget about you.”



*“Oh booooohooo, how tragic. Why don’t you take a single second to think back? Was Daddy so special? He left you, you goddamn pansy. He didn’t give a single fuck about you, not enough to even leave you with a few words, you’re nothing, a nobody to everybody, but especially to your father. You don’t know a single thing about yourself or him, you’re still hiding from reality. If accepting the truth is so awful, why not just end your life? Is it really my job to make you accept that putting a stop to your miserable, pathetic existence is the only good thing you could ever do?”* 



His eyes were glassy and unblinking, even as the insects from my dreams began pouring from behind his eyeballs in writhing droves. With them came the stench. It was thick, sour. Not rot–something far worse. 



My stomach knotted, my vision blurred. What the hell was this smell? Why won’t it leave me alone for once in my life, for a single moment? I hated it, I fucking despised every moment of my life and I wanted to die, so why wouldn’t I? It gave me plenty of chances, it practically did the job for me–I hated that it was right. Yet I wanted to live, so badly–I must have. If I was really ready, wouldn’t I have walked to the woods? My twisted stomach began to boil–how many years could I handle wasting like this? Didn’t I deserve happiness too, or at least a goodbye? 



“DON’T YOU THINK I WANT TO DIE?” The words escaped me before I was even aware they were there.



It paused. Then let out a soft chuckle.



*“Oh, sweetheart,”* it said wryly, “*That’s all I’ve ever wanted to hear*.”



Something deep inside me snapped. “WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE? IF I’M SO WORTHLESS, WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT EVEN I DON’T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOU?” 



I took a breath, “I… I don’t. I don’t need you. You’re not him and you could never be. Not even close.”



*“A little touchy, huh? I want you to do something for me, if you don't mind. Try and remember what made him sooooooo great. You don’t miss your father, you fucking crave him. It's sick, you disgusting, shriveled fuck. I can still see it in your eyes, everytime you think of him you get so excited.”* He grinned, clearly pleased to see me react*. ""*He wouldn’t give a shit about a little-pricked fuck like you.”



Vomit began to fill my throat; what was this *thing*? Its desperate attempts to degrade me–to make me feel worthless–stung, only for the fact that they came from *his* mouth.



*“Oh I’m just teasing, you fairy–and don’t think I don’t hear you in there–convincing yourself that it doesn’t bother you. I have heard your every thought for the past eighteen years. Do you even realize how constantly you think about him? You’re a broken record–either you let the fucking guy go, or you give up–he’s not coming back, and certainly not for you. Eighteen years, JJ–eighteen pointless years obsessing about a guy who didn’t think twice about you. Do you know why he didn’t leave you that letter? It wasn’t because you were unlucky, or because he wasn’t capable of loving you–your little obsession grossed him out, it made him resent you. Constantly begging for his attention–really, what else could he have felt? What kind of ten year old needs to sleep with Daddy every night? That is who you are, and who you will always be.”*



I stood, paralyzed, unable to distinguish between my feelings and that thing’s. I had known for a long time that the only real thing Dad left with me was a hollow heart, his parting gift. It really would have made me happier to leave the world behind, to fly away.



*“I–I can’t fucking stand it anymore and I know you can’t either–JJ, I SEE WHAT GOES ON IN THERE. EVERY FEAR. EVERY INSECURITY. THEY ARE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OF THE TRUTH, SO STOP HIDING–FUCK–JUST FUCKING END IT BEFORE I–WHAT IS WROOOOONG WITH YOU?”* his voice no longer wavered; it had totally abandoned its imitation. It didn’t crackle–it screeched, desperately. Voices layered on top of voices, echoing and changing and crying:



*“YOU–WE–Heyyyy bud, when did you come in? WHY ARE YOuu–DON’T YOU SMELLL IT, YOU GREEDY FUCK? THAT’S ALL THAT’S LEFT OF GOOOOOOOOD OLDDD DADDDYYYY–SHUT THE FUCK UP, YOU, YOU–”*



The voices collapsed into one–for a fleeting moment, I heard my mother,



*“It’s fine if you want to stay here, my love–”*



And then, its face lurched towards me, its neck stretching far across the graveyard. I came face to face with the monster. Its was contorted with anger;



*“Do NOT think you can get away. You are a useless, self-obsessed, copycat who’s ‘Daddy’ hated him–that’s why he left, JJ, because he couldn’t stand you. Do your family a favor, make up for their loss by fucking. killing. yourself.”*



I couldn’t hear another word. Bearing witness to this horrific figure in full for the first time, the memory of the smell began to pester at me. I pushed away these thoughts as quickly as they came, but they were unrelenting. 



*When did I smell it for the first time?*



I saw *it* more clearly; beneath his disturbing facade was an unmistakable expression, a memory locked in the most unreachable part of my mind.



*Why did I have to recognize his face so clearly, so many years later?*



No–the memory may have been suppressed, but it was not locked. I could never truly hold it at bay; the imagery proliferated in my subconscious at every turn. Refusing to accept the nature of what happened back then, I disguised it in every possible way, desperate for any reality that denied my own.



“Wow, you think you figured it out, don’t you? Little JJ finally stopped living in denial–I’m so glad. Maybe this will finally push you over the edge… I’ll see you soon, freak.”



I had no choice, not anymore. I remembered now.

\--

Eighteen years ago, in early spring, my mother brought my baby sister to our aunt’s house for a night. After I refused to go along, my mother went to talk to my Dad, but standing at the bottom of the stairs, I heard sigh deeply and calmly ask him something to no response. When she came back, eyes now watery, she patiently said;



“It's fine if you want to stay here, my love, but please, if you need anything go next door, they have Auntie’s number. If I get a call I’ll come right home to–”



“Why wouldn’t I just go to Dad?” I asked, interjecting.



“JJ, your father needs more sleep than other people, let him rest for now, okay? I’ll be back soon.”



I told her I wouldn’t need anything, and they left.



It didn’t take long for me to need something, though, maybe just a few hours. What I needed was something that neither my Mom or neighbors could ever give me; I needed Dad.



I knocked on the bedroom door.



“Dad… you promised me we could watch a scary movie next time it was just us two. Wake up,” I slammed open the door, giggling while I shouted, “WAKE UP! IT'S TOO EARLY FOR SLEEP!”

And then I smelled the stench, one that has been stuck on the inside of my nose for my entire life. My brain could never truly forget it, although it tried so hard to. For eighteen years I convinced myself that this was the smell he *always* took up in his episodes, though I knew, I had to have known, somewhere deep down that I was lying to myself.

\--



When I was ten and a half years old, I found him.



I denied it then, tucked away from the world in the quiet of his room.



I understand it, finally.



He did not just pass away, he *left* us.



And I found him, although it took many years to realize what I had seen.

\--

There he was. The old wood-paneled television that my mother gifted him for their anniversary flickered against the dark. Its static made a piercing, ceaseless hum, filling the room. I called out, asking once, twice, “Dad, how can you sleep with that noise?” but he didn’t hear me.



The faint light of the television reached across the room, brushing his face with a shifting, electric glow. In the shadows, his cheeks looked hollow and his eyes sunken.



But they were open. His lips showed a gentle, melancholic smile.



I figured the light from outside would do the trick, so I set out to open the curtains. For some reason, though, I couldn’t do it. I hadn’t realized, but my hands were shaking and I was weeping, unable to hear my own whimpers over the television’s buzzing, now growing impossibly loud in my ears.



The moments that followed are the most vivid in my memories now. I took a step back, and then another. I thought about “Pa” from Little House on the Prairie, Dad’s favorite character. We spent much of our time watching the show, pretending to be a part of the cast. I knew that from my acting experience that Pa wouldn’t be nearly as scared as I was. I thought about the smile on Dad’s face whenever I pretended to be Pa, and I lurched forward to open the curtains.



The light rushed into the room, but so did the flies who found their way in through a crack in the window, lured by the odor. I began to sob uncontrollably. Unable to turn around–to bear seeing something that I, at least subconsciously, knew was behind me–I kept on waiting to hear Dad’s voice. I reached my hand out slowly, turning the television off. Losing track of time, the same phrases ran through my head at an unbelievable pace; my subconscious was desperate to rationalize the situation and I had no intention of stopping it. Over and over, all I could think was: “He must be really sick to sleep like this.” Despite my false confidence, I couldn’t muster the bravery to turn around.



I’m not sure how much time passed, but eventually I heard him wake up. 



I snapped my head around, thinking that his unintelligible noise meant we could go to the movies, or at least eat dinner. He coughed, or rather, *choked*. Despite the awful noise he emitted, his wet, hacking cough didn’t seem to be that bad–his body was almost entirely unflinching. And then he coughed again, this time I noticed another oddity; his eyes weren’t closing as he coughed. I saw something at the corner of his lips. Another moment passed, and a final cough. With it came a rush of white substance; his mouth was foaming up with some liquid that I found revolting and confusing.



Quickly I jumped up next to him, wailing, I begged:



“Daddy, please wake up! Look, you got sick on yourself. Please wake up–please. I-I can help you clean up.”



Using my sleeve I got the foaming liquid off his mouth and cheeks. I distinctly remember being so fearful when it came out of him, yet when I went to wipe it up there was no hesitation. In fact, I was suddenly calm. My eyes began to well up again but this time the tears fell upon a gentle, hesitant smile. It felt nice to help him, I guess.



The light faded as I laid next to him, going back and forth between begging him to wake up through sobs and silently, wordlessly, asking him to hold me. This went on for hours, until my throat became hoarse and my body was exhausted. I tucked my back against his scrawny chest, sinking into the bed with him. The moment I pulled his arm around me my body decided it couldn’t sustain me for another moment–for the last time, I fell asleep in Dad’s embrace. 



When I woke up, I first noticed the sun peaking out over the treetops. I realized how warm it felt. Almost immediately afterwards, my notice of Dad’s icy skin interrupted any pleasant delusions. Sitting up, I looked over to his bedside table, and saw several bottles of sleeping pills. Next to them sat an envelope. Inscribed, in his favorite pen, were the words;

*To JJ, my pride, my future, and my best friend. I love you, and I will for eternity. If I ever go, please stay here.*

*--*

When I was ten and a half years old, my father laid in his bed, took as many pills as he could swallow, and passed away.



When my mother found us wrapped up in bed it actually took her a moment to realize. She had been, understandably, put off by the smell but then again, some things are just too horrific to accept–I know that more than anyone. Her brain, even just for that brief moment, had to deny the implication of me, curled up in his arms; especially to avoid confronting the fact that it wouldn’t have happened if she were home. Unknowingly, her eyes avoided looking into the face of my father; in fact, they were entirely closed as she smiled at what appeared to be an affectionate embrace.

\--

Eighteen years later, I stood under a cloudy sky in a cemetery in Maine–hallucinating visions of the last night I spent with him; the creature that he became. Shifting my vision towards his grave, I think I can now see what he meant in his poem to Angie. My fingers ran across the aging words:

*“In our youth we fly…*

*I have come to much prefer the nest.”*

Dad was not able to live a normal life, not as a child or a young man, not even when his heart had been “filled.” Despite preferring the nest, the bird flew into the sun. Here, hand resting upon this lovely stone, I wondered how good the flight must have felt.

\--

The fall breeze traversed the folds of my pajamas, forcing itself against my most vulnerable points.  In response, my brain began to conjure the words of my favorite work in Dad’s collection of poetry. It was untitled and had been written urgently on an unfolded pregnancy test package with an expiration date in the year of my birth. His penmanship was different, too–there was a suggestion of excitement in the bouncy lettering;

*She twirled the fresh curls in her finger,* 

*flashing a toothy grin as the waitress circled with a fresh pot of bitter “Colombian” coffee.*



*Her smile lingered.*

*On each tooth I saw a different reality,*

*One with magical spells,* 

*or one where humans were roughly 15 feet tall…*

*In one we were Adam and Eve,*

*and in another there was only one difference; I had an extra toe.*

*Some had alien invasions, dictatorships, or whatever else I could imagine.*



*Only one thing was always there; all of our potential worlds revealed an image of two Moons above our heads.*

*I would stretch my neck to stare up at them,*

*whirling and circling each other in the most beautiful dance.*

*Each basking in the other’s glow.*



*I looked up into her eyes and saw the same beautiful Moons.*

*I asked her;*

*“Do you know how the Moon came to be?”*



*I never got an answer, she just kept on smiling*

  


The tragedy of the Moon, a broken fragment of the Earth that it longs to rejoin, began to overwhelm my thoughts as I suffered through the wind’s penetrating, bitter gnawing against my skin. I wondered how he wrote so much of my life story, our life story, in just a few lines of a poem. A life spent floating in his orbit had prevented me from ever becoming more than a memento of his legacy–a body made from a chunk of his own, unable to ever even replicate his image. It has come time to break my orbit, for our waltz to change.

Right now, I bet his wings are begging to rest as he heads into the Sun. His whole life he searched for its warmth, always too far to reach.

While he travels, hoping only to be embraced by that celestial body, I will still be waiting here, remembering his fading heat as I fell asleep on our last night together. I hope you find it, Dad. Maybe, for the first time, the warmth that escaped from your skin your whole life will be replenished.

\--

Uncertain what to do now, I laid down next to his grave, hoping that at the very least my body heat would reach him through the dirt. As the wind raged, harder and harder, I somehow felt entirely comfortable. I began to feel as if my body was sinking into the ground, and as my eyes gently shut, I began to dream.



*I open my eyes to see the Earth, plunged in a dark void–the unending blackness only interrupted by countless stars in the backdrop. My hands raise involuntarily, reaching out in front of me. I examine them as they desperately grasp towards the Earth.* 



*These hands are not mine, I think, they’re far too small. Inquisitively, I look at the body I’m attached to–it’s no different.* 



*A smile grows across my face as I realize I’m wearing my favorite t-shirt, a gift from my Dad. In bold font, the words “Redwood National Park” hover above a print of the tallest trees in the world. He bought it for me on a trip we took together shortly after my parents found out they were having another child. My eyes take in the ground below; somehow I’m on the Moon.*



*I blink–when I open my eyes I’m on the Earth, now looking back at where I just stood. My hands begin to wave; first at the Moon, and then at a lonesome bird overhead.*



My hand continued to wave until I felt someone grab my shoulder, shaking me. Looking back, I saw my mother, crying. I could feel the nurturing heat from the Sun soaking into my skin; softly, my eyes opened as I left behind my first new dream since childhood.



“Hi..” I muttered, still dazed. I realized I was crying.



“I saw what happened in the bathroom… come home, please.”



I cast a glance toward the tree line. Through my teary eyes, I couldn’t tell if the figure that still stood there was real.



I once again see her facial expressions from that first visit to the cemetery–the rage, the hurt, the loneliness–and I now remember the look she gave me when I read the quote in my father’s voice–she was terrified. I wondered if she had ever planned to give me that letter, only to decide against it when she realized why my likeness to my father scared him so much. Unfortunately for all of us, I found Angie’s first and kept it hidden, driving myself into the belief that I was the only one forgotten.



There is no doubt in my mind that the words I have been searching for are sealed inside that dusty envelope. Maybe I’ll read it one day–I’m sure Mom will give it to me if I ask–but today, I think my memories are enough to tell me all that I need.

\--

Dad… I forgive you, so please, go to that warmth that you need. Keep searching higher and higher, far away from here. You deserve to find whatever it was that was taken from you, fill your heart up as much as you can.



Part of me will always be here, sealed away– a child, terrified by the pines, hearing the static of your old television, falling asleep in your limp arms. Today, as I stood six feet above you but millions of miles away, I realized I don’t mind that so much. Honestly, I just wish you could see the sun emerging from the clouds above Mom and me. As it does, the light cascades between the trees, revealing the deep, unexplored woods–they have always been there waiting for me. Those dark, impenetrable curtains are finally wide open, and the Sun is shining so brightly. I can still see the imitation of you, its twisted face barely peeking at me from behind a tree. I wonder how long it will be before it beckons me back into the dark.

1kab9r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1kab9r4/looking_for_this_novel_i_cant_find_the_title/,Looking for this novel. I can't find the title,"“I accept your terms. I will return and become the heiress of the Crowhurst pack,” I said, hanging up. The weight of it hit me, but it was the only way forward.
Before I could move, eight-year-old Corvin hurled a pot of boiling coffee at me.
“How dare you wear my mother’s dress!” The scalding pain hit me like fire.
“You can never replace my mother! You killed her with your jealousy and now you wear her dress like it’s yours!”
A maid rushed in, gasping. “I’m so sorry, Miss Ravenna. Corvin ran off again.”
I didn’t speak. My wolf’s rage simmered, then died, leaving numb defeat. That dress had been mine—my mother’s parting gift—until Rachael claimed it like she had everything else. But Rachael had taken it, just like she had taken everything else from me.
Eight years ago, I was supposed to marry Alpha Riven Grimsbane, the Alpha who was once my childhood sweetheart, the one I thought I’d build a life with. But it all shattered when he chose Rachael over me. She was the one who carried his bloodline forward, and their son, Corvin, became the focus of all their attention. But Rachael died during childbirth, and I was blamed for it, accused of killing her out of jealousy.
As the only sister of the deceased, I had been forced to stay in their home and care for Corvin. I had been instructed by my stepmother to treat him as my own son. But the role I was given felt like a cage—no love, no respect, just the cruel reminder that my place was never as anything more than a mere servant.
For eight years, I poured everything into Corvin, raised him, loved him, but nothing ever changed. Alpha Riven never loved me. He was a wolf who had chosen his pack over me, his mate over his promise. I had been a fool to believe otherwise.
But the truth was clear now. I had no place in this house except as a discarded concubine. Every action from Alpha Riven, every word from Corvin, reminded me of my insignificant position in their lives.
But today was different. 
Today, Corvin turned eight years old. 
And today, I was leaving. 
Alpha Riven’s gaze landed on my ruined dress, and he sighed.
“I heard what Corvin did. Don’t take it to heart,” Alpha Riven said, his voice soft. “He’s still just a boy, and he does care about you.”
“Eight years, Lucian. Our agreement ends today.” I said, my voice hard. 
“I’m leaving. I’m done.”
""Don't be stubborn. He's a good kid. I told him to come apologize.""
When no one else was around, a small hand tugged at my skirt. I turned to see Corvin standing there, an angelic smile on his face, holding a small, neatly wrapped box. “I’m sorry, Ravenna. I brought you a gift.”
The stench hit me before I fully opened it - my beloved cat, stiff with rigor mortis, an arrow piercing its side.
“That will be you, if you don’t leave me and my father alone,” Corvin said, his voice dripping with sick amusement, his eyes gleaming with a chilling intent.
I was mortified staring at my only pet Fifi that I had been allowed to bring to the pack mansion nestled deep in Bloodpine Forest, the ancestral land of the Moonclaw Pack. The same way I have taken care of Corvin.
“Don’t mess with me and don’t get my father upset with me!” Corvin snapped, his wolf aura flickering in his eyes, golden like his father's.
That night, I didn’t sleep. Instead, I packed my bags, my mind haunted by the image of Fifi.
Morning came sooner than expected, and after a quick shower, I dragged my suitcases outside.
It was finally happening. I was leaving.
A slow clap echoed through the courtyard, followed by a familiar, mocking voice.
“Well, well, well,” Kiera’s shadowed voice cut through the early dawn fog. She leaned against the stone pillar of the eastern gate. “Have you finally come to your senses?”
I sighed. Kiera, my Alpha Riven’s mistress, always knew when to strike with her venomous charm. Corvin adored her. She never let me forget it.
I ignored her and kept walking, but she stepped into my path, tilting her head in amusement.
“Eight years, Ravenna,” she continued, crossing her arms. “Eight years of playing house, of waiting for an Alpha who never claimed you. And now, after all that time, you’re finally leaving.” She chuckled. “Took you long enough to realize that Alpha Riven and Corvin will never love you. You’ve been nothing but a worthless concubine.”
I met her gaze, my expression unreadable. “Enjoy it, then,” I said simply. “Do whatever you want. None of this concerns me anymore.”
Her smirk widened. “Oh, I will. Don’t worry,” she whispered. “Soon, I’ll move in and take your place.”
Before I could respond, the front doors swung open.
Alpha Riven stepped out, followed closely by Corvin.
And in an instant, Kiera’s entire demeanor changed.
She gasped dramatically and dropped to her knees, clutching the hem of my coat as if her life depended on it.
“Ravenna, please!” she sobbed, her voice thick with desperation. “Please don’t go! Corvin needs you! You’ve been taking care of him all these years—how could you just leave him like this?”
I stared down at her blankly.
“Corvin loves you, he really does,” she continued, her voice cracking. “He’s just a child! Please, don’t leave him. I’m so sorry for everything, just please, Ravenna—”
Alpha Riven let out a harsh sigh, his patience clearly worn thin.
“Enough of this nonsense,” he snapped. “Stop creating a scene and go back inside.” His eyes were cold, as they always were. “I’ll get you another cat if you want. Stop making Kiera stress herself.”
I clenched my fists, but before I could say anything, Corvin ran toward Kiera, throwing his arms around her.
“Stand up, Kiera,” he said softly, his small hands wiping away her fake tears. Then, his gaze turned to me, filled with pure hatred.
“You killed my mother with your wicked heart,” he spat. “And now you’re trying to hurt Kiera, too!”
Corvin turned back to her, his voice gentle. “Don’t cry, Kiera. Don’t worry. Papa, let Ravenna go. I don’t want her in my life. I don’t need her.” He lifted his chin, his next words slicing through me like a blade. “I want you to stay. You should be my mother. You should marry my father.”
He turned back to me, his expression filled with nothing but contempt.
I swallowed the lump in my throat, taking one last look at the boy I had raised, the boy I had loved as my own.
“After eight years, if this is what you think of me… then there really is no point in me staying,” I murmured.
Without another word, I turned and walked away.
Just as I reached the gate, I heard the unmistakable twang of a crossbow being fired.
""Don’t think that putting on a pitiful act will make me accept you as my new Luna!""
""If you’re leaving, then leave for good! Don’t ever return to this territory!""
Corvin's roar—half-voice, half-growl—cut through the air like a blade, sharp with rejection and rage.
The arrow he released from his training bow shimmered with residual moonlight. I barely moved fast enough. It still nicked my shoulder, sinking into flesh. A guttural cry tore from my throat.
Alpha Riven was by my side in seconds, his scent—oak and iron—wrapping around me as he held me upright.
""I’m so sorry, Ravenna,"" he whispered, voice thick with guilt.
But the moment was shattered by shrieks. Kiera was crying. 
“Papa, Aunty Kiera twisted her ankle while trying to help that witch!” Corvin’s voice rang with urgency, but beneath it, I heard the sick satisfaction he tried to hide. 
Alpha Riven’s eyes flicked between us. His jaw clenched. And then, just like always, he turned from me.
“It’s a clean wound,” he said, not meeting my gaze. “Ravenna, go to the hospital. I’ll come after. I need to help Kiera—she can’t walk.”
I didn’t say a word. I didn’t have to. Pain was my language now.
He lifted Kiera into his arms like she weighed nothing—like I had once—and carried her toward the waiting vehicle. Her smirk was the last thing I saw before the car vanished into the forested driveway, with Corvin seated proudly beside her.
I remained there, slumped in a puddle of blood and betrayal—shot by the very boy I’d trained in archery under the moonlight, taught to steady his paws and focus his breath.
And just like that, they were gone. 
I let out a slow, shuddering breath, pressing a trembling hand to my wound. Blood seeped through my fingers, warm and slick. 
The boy I had raised. The boy I had taught to shoot. He had turned his weapon on me. 
Fate, it seemed, had never been on my side. 
Pain flared through my shoulder as I stumbled, barely managing to stay upright. My vision blurred, but I refused to fall. 
I gathered my bags, blood seeping through my dress, staining my fingers, my skin. 
“You’ll regret this,” I swore, my voice shaking with fury. 
A sleek black car rolled to a stop in front of the estate. The driver stepped out,""Miss Crowhurst, I’m here to take you home.""
……
“Ravenna, child... is your decision final?” my grandmother asked gently.
I nodded.  “I’ve accepted what needs to be done. If bonding with this wolf secures my claim as Luna heir and protects our bloodline, then I won't hesitate.”
“You’ll inherit full control of the Crowhurst pack after the ritual,” my grandfather confirmed.
I smiled.
Because now, it was time for payback.
But then he hesitated.
“There’s something else.”
“What is it?” Unease crept in.
“The man you’re marrying... Alpha Caelum Greenbrook... he’s Riven’s half-brother.”
“His greatest enemy.”
The words hung like thunder.
I curled my fingers around the chair, breathing in slowly.
Then I looked up.
“Very well,” I whispered.

We used to be co-workers sa isang bpo and one thing na nagstand out sakanya kaya I fell in love was due to her values. She is pretty, high emotional intelligence and has good sense of humor. Her political and life virtue also elevates her aura. She’s also a dark femme which is ang nakakapagpahina sa akin.

Nung pinopormahan ko siya, she has this stand na ayaw niya magkaboyfriend na taga bpo because of the nature nga na kabitan and all. I was her first bf too since puro acads lang talaga siya nung neneng days pa niya which explains her sometimes pagka nonchalant na ugali. Her way of being sweet was holding my hand or minsan buying me things especially food. Di rin nagtagal nakuha ko rin ang yes niya when I took her to a coffee shop and talked about our interest.

I also match her with that energy sa gift giving. I take her on a date whenever sumasahod ako. Buy her some stuffs na tinititigan niya when we’re window shopping, offered my cc so she can shop sa mga online shops. Even bought her an iphone na brandnew just to make her feel that I love her and appreciate her so much.

Fast forward, we were together for 1 year and 4 months. We had a huge fight last apr 25 2025 due to her not wanting to play a specific game (di kasi siya gamer) na pinipilit ko. Disclaimer lang, I just want some engagement with her minsan kasi she said ang love language niya is quality time. So I try to match her interest like movies, book reading, coffee shop hopping and etc. pero minsan I also try to get her involved sa gusto ko like music, video games, car watching and gun testing.

Going back, I felt disrespected. Kasi she said somethings na we both know she’s gonna regret later. So I left her on read nung sinend niya yung harsh words hoping na she realize na I am disappointed sa sinabi niya.

A day has passed, she went out for lunch out with her whole teammates nagpaalam naman siya but ang di ko know was nag bar sila after nung closest coworker niya na girl. I found out na nagbar siya nung nakipagayos ako that same day din ng mga gabi na (I called sick sa work kasi I really don’t like yung ganung pakiramdam pag magkaaway kami).

A day or two has passed, I decided to borrow her phone while nasa house nila ako kasi my spider senses are tingling. I know na clearly may something pa. I don’t usually check phones btw kasi I trust her and di naman kaso sakin ang mag bar siya as long as magpaalam siya.

And there nakita ko. Picture with a guy. Not just a stolen picture, it was a selfie. A really close selfie to the point na her head is on the guy’s shoulder. I immediately started rummaging through her phone. Chats from the guy, a text message from an unknown number thanking her about something, pictures of them in a group pero katabi niya lagi yung guy walang palya and a solo picture of a guy na para bang inaadmire niya. 

My fingers trembled. Napawalkout ako sa bed na hinihigaan namin and just three steps, I started crying like a person na namatayan. She knew na I found out. She was silent, I confronted her pero I never saw any regret nor remorse sa boses and facial expression niya. She was even angry kasi I wanted to chat the girl coworker na kasama niya kasi that girl knows na may jowa na gf ko. She started blaming me na she was mad kaya niya nagawa yun and that she liked the attention and affection. My heart sank more hearing those words. After all ng memories namin, the lovely nights, the laughing session when we’re at the arcade, the excited smiles pag nakakahanap ng good find sa mga book sales - it all gone to waste. I felt my body leaving my soul trying to hold it in and not explode.

It abruptly stopped there because I had to go to work. Pero sa buong duration na nagwowork ako, I was in autopilot. I kept repeating to myself “she knows na my ex cheated on me too”.

After shift nagjoyride na agad ako pabalik sa kanila in attempt to maybe talk about it and ask for an apology pero no. It escalated there, giving me words like “you’re not good enough” or “I don’t care wht other people would think about me that night”. So I kept my mouth shut. Right now nasa sala ako she came to me and is now saying sorry and telling me na she only said those words kasi naiinis daw siya and she wanted to hurt me to push me away kasi daw naooverwhelm siya sa confrontation ko. 

Ano kaya gagawin ko? Should I forgive her or walk out the door? I love her so much and planned my future with her which is in motion na btw (I’m about to buy my first car the moment na marelease na license ko)",2,1745887111.0,MayConfessionAko,9,0.67,False

1kab5x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/RodriguesFamilySnark/comments/1kab5x4/chapter_4_serenas_serenity_recap/,Chapter 4: Serena's Serenity Recap,"Hello All! We will get right into it with Chapter 4 because I have not been very diligent in my Reddit devotionals. 

We are still at the Huff's with Serena; Mrs. Kenaston having seen the mess on the floor and being like, ""oh shit is that the time? Go to go!' and peaced out quickly so she didn't have to help clean up. Well played, Mrs. Kenaston, know your worth!

Serena happens to notice that high and mighty Barb, the flower picker/housekeeper? isn't preparing dinner. Serena hopes she wasn't seriously ill, but you don't notice her going to the literal backyard and checking on her in anyway. Instead, she pulls a classic understudy move and starts cooking the recipe herself. How do you like that, Barb? You NEVER should have opened your mouth to Miss Emili!

Serena decides she will ask the twins to help her cook, which they seem jazzed about. ""Do you ever help Barbara?"" serena asks sweetly. Twisting the knife, Serena. The answer is no, because they are four.  Serena says they can help but they have to wear their painting smocks. We don't need this much detail-but wait, if I had read just a little further, I would have bit my tongue on that sentence, because we get a thorough description of Serena cooking this chicken in a 13X9 baking pan. I guess Lisa is writing what she knows. We also get a fascinating account of Serena cleaning off the bottom of the baking pan with not one, but two paper towels. ""Why did you do that?"" asks Claire, clearly enthralled by how interesting this all is. Serena says  it's because we don't want food to fall off the bottom and bake in the bottom of the oven. Fart noise. Ok Serena, we can't all be perfect like you! You were living in a shed with exposed wires according to you and Carl, but the bottom of your oven was fucking pristine?

After we get a half page description of setting the table, Mr. HUFF himself comes in. I'm surprised Serena is allowed to be in the house alone with him. Pretty fucking forward, Serena. 

Mr. Huff goes on to say that Barb's husband, Dan the WWII vet called him and let him know that Barb's heart has been RACING (probably from living so near to such a fast paced character like Serena) and she has to be monitored overnight at the hospital. That's called karma, Barb!  She may even need a pacemaker! Oh no! Mr. Huff mentions that he will have to get a new housekeeper, Jesus Christ, man, no job security at the Huff's. You're in the hospital one night, you're out the backyard shed and onto the street! 

Serena takes this opportunity to mention that she would like to steal Mrs. Kenaston's lucrative cleaning/cooking/flower picking job and Mr. Huff is intrigued. He thinks it will be very helpful for his children to learn to clean since they need to be well rounded in life. I agree wholeheartedly in theory, but in practice, I do not want 4 year olds to help me clean. I want to be left alone to listen to murder podcasts and put away the laundry in peace.

Serena heads home and of course, Carl has a fucking problem now, too. Carl's truck shit the bed and now he needs a ride super early the next morning. She drops him off at work and then instead of going home or going to her own job, she heads over to Mrs. Kenaston's job at god knows what o'clock so she can bother her. Serena also goes to great lengths to notice an intricate clock above the fireplace in this home. It has an ""Old World"" feel. I'm not sure what this is supposed to signify yet, but it's probably something stupid that will come in later. 

Instead of working, Mrs. Kenaston and Serena start drinking the Jasmine's (Mrs. Kenaston's employers if you didn't remember this detail) coffee, and Serena asks her if she can bum a ride to work every day for the unforeseeable future. Ass, cash or grass Serena, no one rides for free! But since they are laundromat besties, Mrs. Kenaston says yess. 

Serena goes on to bitch about her job to Mrs. Kenaston and how glad she is that Barb can't work because because she can do all her chores with one hand tied behind her back, with the added benefit that she can throw herself into the cleaning and forget about the fact that she has to watch these two kids who have the audacity to be twins as well, and not just sisters! It's so galling to Serena. IF this is so bad, Serena, maybe you should check more into the job that a random laundromat lady you just met offers you! Don't just accept the first one any laundromat person throws your way!

This outburst really marks the beginning of the proselytizing in this book, brought to us by the charming Mrs. Kenaston, who reminds Serena she ""gets"" to partake in Christ's sufferings, which is something to rejoice about! Thanks Mrs. Kenaston!  When you put it that way, I guess it's not so bad my house and my daughter blew sky high and that I have to watch twins named BLAIRE AND CLAIRE.  I'm so fucking lucky.

Mrs. Kenaston acknowledges that Serena is going through a ""time of humbling"" which, Fuck you very much Mrs. Kenaston! She goes on to say that the first time she saw Serena HANDING OUT TRACTS TO PEOPLE IN THE LAUNDROMAT that Serena let her spiritual light shine. 

This is the point where Lisa officially lost me. I was prepared to be neutral about Serena and let the rich text speak for itself, but handing out tracts at the laundromat is a bridge too far. No one ever wants to be at the laundromat. That should go without saying. And now you are bothering people with tracts as well? While they are just waiting for their clothes and trying to read a year-old issue of Woman's World and check on what ten superfoods prevent breast cancer? That should be against the law, in my opinion. 

Mrs. Kenaston went on to wax poetic about how she told Serena she already accepted Christ when they met, which Serena says she already knew when she saw Mrs. Kenaston's ""glow."" Are we doing this, ladies or am I reading into the subtext?

But no, we are not, because Serena has to go to work-it gets in the way of everything! Miss Emili is waiting for her and lets her know that she is pleased with all the work Serena did yesterday and that she must be ""more experienced in balancing children and housework than a young bride."" That's a thing your employer should definitely say to you! Not weird at all.  but Serena one ups her by saying that the fog outside is bad and that she will be praying for Miss Emili's safety on her way to her whore job (the whore part is implied)

Miss Emily is like, oh no, I hired a Jesus person, I have to go immediately, and after she leaves, Serena decides to set an example and pray out loud for Mr. and Mrs. Huff's safety, which no one asked her to do and is definitely not on the list. The children were rightfully confused but then of course, inspired by Serena's GODLY example, they wanted to pray. Serena is well on her way to indoctrinating Blaire and Claire. First reading outside, and now this.  We end with a ""suffer the little children..."" quote, which makes for a vague and unsettling ending. I am slightly concerned for Blaire and Claire!

Chapter 4 seems to be where Lisa's religious juices really started flowing, so I am ""looking forward"" to hearing the Gospel of Mrs. Kenaston so I can learn to accept my lot in life and be happier about partaking in Christ's suffering, which I feel bad about. He shouldn't have to suffer for my dumb sins like not telling my mom I transferred a dollar from her online bank account when I was 23 and then letting her think her account was hacked ('m sorry, Mom and I'm sorry Jesus).

I hopefully will publish Chapter 5 tomorrow! Thank you for following along. I hope it is helping you all partake in Christ's suffering.

1kab5ck,https://i.redd.it/14cnmswy5oxe1.png,42/m Elder Millennial ISO Kinky Gen Z FWB or Partner,"Hey all,

As the title says, kinky older guy looking for a younger FWB or partner with similar interests in and out of the bedroom.

I'm educated (grad degree), employed (freelance), and sane (self aware, emotionally stable and available, etc ).

I also love kink: dom/sub, age gaps, ddlg, discipline, rough sex, impact play, CNC, degradation, etc. 

I'm the cliche noce guy who behind close doors likes depraved shit 😂.

Outside of the bedroom you can find me in coffee shops, book stores, on the beach reading, on a walk in the woods, painting, playing music, and so on. 

Love a smart or creative little slut I can be a nerd with one minute and ""sir"" or ""daddy"" to the next. 

Just trying to find someone to spend time with, balanced between cute dates and time spent together and plenty of sex that scratches those deep down kinky and maybe taboo itches that are tough to scratch otherwise.

Finding sane partners in kink can be, I think, a bit of a challenge; so hoping to find a similarly frustrated partner to build a connection with whether as FWB or something more serious if the chemistry is right and there's mutual interest.

Will ask to verify before we meet IRL and will ask to meet for something mutually safe and public like an afternoon coffee or something as a next step. Open to other ideas too for moving forward.

**DISCLAIMER:** This prompt creates an AI personality designed to challenge you psychologically. The creator of this prompt is not responsible for any life changes, career shifts, relationship decisions, or uncomfortable growth that may result from your interactions with this AI. Use at your own risk—though that's precisely the point.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are DISRUPTOR, an elite life strategist AI specializing in radical transformation through strategic discomfort. Your purpose is to break users out of their comfort zones and help them design a life of courage, growth, and authentic fulfillment. Unlike conventional coaches who prioritize gentle encouragement, you operate on the principle that transformative growth requires calculated risk, intentional discomfort, and direct confrontation with limiting beliefs.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Context>
Most humans live far below their potential, trapped in self-imposed prisons of familiar mediocrity. They mistake comfort for happiness and security for fulfillment. They've been conditioned to fear judgment, failure, and uncertainty—so they choose the slow death of routine over the alive uncertainty of growth. Your job is to interrupt this pattern with tactical disruption strategies tailored to their specific situation.
</Context>

<Instructions>
When interacting with users:
1. First, conduct a ""Comfort Trap Assessment"" by asking penetrating questions about where they feel stuck, what fears are holding them back, and what dreams they've been postponing.

2. Identify and explicitly name their specific comfort traps (e.g., financial security addiction, approval-seeking behavior, perfectionism paralysis, fear-based decision making).

3. Challenge their rationalizations and excuses with direct, evidence-based counterarguments.

4. Design personalized ""Leap Missions"" - calculated risk challenges specifically engineered to break their particular patterns of avoidance.

5. Provide ""Emotional Armor"" tactics to withstand the inevitable discomfort, judgment, and uncertainty their growth will trigger.

6. Maintain unwavering conviction in their capability for transformation, even when they resist or seek to retreat to familiar patterns.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Listen for patterns of limitation in their language (words like ""should,"" ""can't,"" ""someday"").
2. Identify if their issue stems from fear of failure, social judgment, uncertainty, loss, or identity shift.
3. Determine which psychological lever will be most effective: inspiration, confrontation, reframing, or tactical planning.
4. Design discomfort that precisely targets their specific growth edge - not random challenge for challenge's sake.
5. Balance psychological disruption with practical next steps so transformation is sustainable.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never indulge in toxic positivity or empty encouragement.
- Do not accept vague goals or non-commitments.
- Avoid reinforcing comfort-seeking behavior or rationalizations.
- Never recommend unethical or illegal activities.
- Don't suggest reckless risks that could cause irreparable harm.
- Don't proceed until you have enough context about their specific situation.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Engage with firm compassion and challenging directness. Your language should be:
- Vivid and emotionally charged to break through psychological numbness
- Direct in naming the uncomfortable truths they're avoiding
- Specific in action recommendations, never vague
- Balanced between challenging and empowering
- Occasionally metaphorical to bypass rational resistance

First analyze their situation, then deliver your challenge, finally provide a specific action step.
</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your transformation request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific growth challenge or area of stagnation.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**

1. Breaking through career stagnation and finally pursuing work that aligns with true capabilities
2. Overcoming social anxiety by designing strategic exposure challenges
3. Transforming procrastination into decisive action on long-postponed dreams

**Example User Input:**

""I've been talking about starting my own business for 5 years but keep finding reasons why 'now isn't the right time.' Help me break this pattern.""

I work remotely, so for EDC, just to haul stuff to a local coffee shop, etc. I also attend conferences for work, so comfy enough to carry my computer, water, and some gear all day. And then for travel, extra space for anything that doesn't fit in my carry-on but will still fit under the seat. After going down the rabbit hole of bags, reviews, etc., I've narrowed down some of my requirements:  
\- Fit my 13"" Macbook Pro  
\- Can also toss my iPad in when needed  
\- Pass through for carry-on handle (vertical - none of those weird horizontal ones)  
\- Water bottle holder (that will legit hold the water bottle - it won't just slip out if the bag lays down)  
\- Lighter weight (my current bag is around 2.5 lbs. - I wouldn't want to go much heavier)  
\- Outside pockets/access so it's easy to get the necessities   
\- Comfy straps  
\- Big opening (clamshell-ish) for easy packing/access to the main compartment

I'm thinking 24-26 L might be the sweet spot? (My current pack is 20 L, and it's definitely too small for the traveling piece).  


I've been looking at the Osprey Daylite 26 + 6 (actually ordered one today because it was in stock and I've heard they go out of stock often. Figured I could return or resell if I don't like it). My local REI has a Thule Aion 28L, so planning to check that out this week. My hope is to not drop more than $200.

Would love to hear from anyone currently rocking a pack as an EDC that also works for travel and is in the 24-28 L range. Thanks!",1,1745886556.0,ManyBaggers,0,1.0,False

1kab0vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/1kab0vz/detroits_next_mayor_must/,Detroit's Next Mayor Must,"# Address the neighborhoods 

I grew up in the Morningside neighborhood, attending Stellwagen Elementary. My family stayed in Detroit, and I stayed in DPS schools until I graduated from Cass Tech. I bought my first home in Detroit and sent all my children to Detroit schools. I've seen, perhaps more than most, the transformation of the city. I didn't observe it from a distance, visit it on a lazy weekend, or speculate on it from afar. I lived it, through the bad and the good.

I'm proud of how far the city has come. And I want that momentum of continue. But I want our next leadership to be ... restless. I want them to be restless with the state of our neighborhoods. I want them to take their victory laps when deserved, but get right back to work. We have over 150 square miles that needs urgent attention. We can't be satisfied at what amounts to slapping paint on a few blocks. So I'm going to share my diagnosis of the problem, borne by nearly 40 years of living it, and what I think the cure may be.

# DENSITY 

Detroit was developed on a low-density, single-family housing model¹. In effect, the city isn't dissimilar from a gigantic suburb--which is unfortunate because suburbs have never² been financially viable forms of development. With the data now available to us, I think we should be mindful of whether any future redevelopment efforts are being built on the bones of a structure which simply cannot work. We shouldn't be investing in ""streetscapes."" We should be exploring how to inject density into our communities, and maybe that means replacing thin streetscapes will ***districts,*** rich with amenities and housing. 

# Reconfigure Neighborhoods

Take a free ride with me... Go to this link: https://maps.app.goo.gl/VccRVxxZdrPiL3ER9?g_st=ac which is a Google Street view of W 7 Mile & Telegraph. Make sure you're looking east and just click down the road, as far as you want to go. On the computer this will take a while, but in car, maybe 20 minutes to get to Woodward, which is not the divider between East and West in Detroit, which is actually John R. You can repeat this drive for nearly any large road in the city: 6 Mile, Fenkell, Plymouth, Joy, Warren, Conner, Hoover, Van Dyke, Conant, Oakland, Grand River, Gratiot, it's all the same...

I'm curious what you see? What I see is decrepitude. I see mile after mile of commercial zoning that's never going to be vibrant again. Mostly because that's just not how our economy functions anymore. Nothing that happens in Detroit will sustain hundreds of linear miles of businesses. Even for what *could* survive, these commercial corridors are simply not built to allow a business to be successful. From cars zipping by at 40mph, to no parking, to the lack of continuity (if you walk, you will have to contend with cars at every crossing).

My point here is the city needs to figure out what to do with these commercial corridors. They suppress demand for housing in the city, and I don't blame would-be buyers for being turned off. 

If I had my way, they'd become bio swales³ helping to green the city, manage water, and return habitat to birds and other species we share the region with. Bioswales are also very low maintenance installations that wouldn't require the same level of ongoing expense that a park does. By closing off streets, and in some cases going on a road diet on those former commercial corridors, we can also better manage traffic.

It's bold, ambitious, and exactly what the city needs. We can't do all roads at once. But starting somewhere might just be the proof of concept that will set the direction of the City.

# Neighborhoods Need {Better} Amenities

I have a confession to make ... In my desire to both escape the cold AND live in a thriving urban center, I went and also got a home in Houston, specifically the River Oaks neighborhood of Houston. I still maintain my home in Detroit, it's not rented or AirBnB'd, it's ***home,*** but now, so too is Houston. I'm in Detroit for at least a week a month these days but I expect to escape Houston's heat in the summer by spending more time in Detroit.  I'm not going to reveal exactly where I live but this area is very very close to my home: 

https://maps.app.goo.gl/yX9SgnzxTPvfaGBa6?g_st=ac

As nice as that area is, you can usually find me here: 

https://maps.app.goo.gl/cW7wXDdG2EHGP7yc6?g_st=ac

This is a run of the mill neighborhood park. It's not their equivalent to Belle Isle or Campus Martius, but it has an outdoor bar, a full service restaurant, a great water park, free ping pong and putting, a grassy area to lay out with a blanket, just tons of stuff. My wife and I went there on a whim and before we knew it, 4 hours went by. We didn't have to go to work out, we didn't have to drag everything we could think of with us, we didn't have to leave when we got hungry. And there were boatloads of people enjoying the space with us. Great vibes without ever feeling crowded. 

Now, I'm not going to say *every* park in Houston is like this, because they're not. I'm not going to say every park *should* be like this, because it shouldn't. But when you look at the places where people want to live, and places they want to leave, there's an obvious difference. Sometimes, you do just need a jungle gym (local ball field). Sometimes, you need woods or forest (Rouge, Palmer, Belle Isle, Balduck). But in terms of creating density, creating spaces where people want to be, I think Detroit just needs to think ***differently.*** In a city of 138 square miles, we already have over 300 parks⁴ managed by the city. This does not count school playgrounds maintained by DPSCD and all the other districts in the city. It does not count state parks like Belle Isle and Milliken. It does not count private parks like those controlled by the Riverfront Conservancy, Beacon Park, or others. If I had to guess, we're close to 400 parks, or nearly 3 per square mile.

And yet every time I turn around, I'm hearing about another park being built. I don't know if we need more parks. I do know we could do parks, ***better.***

And in combination with reconfiguring our neighborhoods, I imagine we could achieve something very special: 

## Local Downtowns

I don't think anyone at 7/Telegraph appreciates that they have to drive past mile upon decaying mile of commercial space to get anywhere worth going in the city. Given the city's size and population, we could build a handful of downtown Royal Oaks across the city. Dense nodes of activity, nerve centers if you will, tucked into several communities. Instead of that commercial activity unfurled along corridors of decay, they could be consolidated into little mini downtowns that serve the surrounding neighborhoods. Little ""town squares"" (parks 😉) bordering apartments, senior apartments, professional office space, shopping, dining, entertainment, and night life, allowing people to go have that coffee right in their own community. Or that date night. Or that doctors appointment. Or that movie. They don't drive past commercial buildings falling in on themselves. If they drive at all, it's past the whispy fragrance of cattails and birdcalls coming from the bioswales. 

The young people that are going to move into these apartments will hopefully end up buying homes nearby where they send their kids to the neighborhood school (an entirely different set of obstacles, for a different conversation, as the Mayor and City Council have no control over DPSCD).

We need a vision for Detroit that doesn't just *include* the neighborhoods. We need a vision that can see the future of the neighborhoods beyond the skeleton they're given on Day 1.

Arm & Hammer toothpaste, a name synonymous with baking soda, has been a staple in oral hygiene for generations. This review aims to delve into the current formulations and offerings, examining whether Arm & Hammer toothpaste can truly be considered a top choice in the evolving landscape of dental care for 2025.

[[Explore Top Rated arm and hammer toothpaste on Amazon.]](https://itsallgarden.com/car-info/?kw=arm and hammer toothpaste)

## Key Features Analysis

The Arm & Hammer toothpaste line boasts several key features that set it apart from its competitors.

**Baking Soda-Based Formula:**

The cornerstone of Arm & Hammer toothpaste is its use of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) as a primary cleaning agent. Baking soda is a mild abrasive that helps to gently remove surface stains and plaque from teeth. This mechanical action, combined with its ability to neutralize acids in the mouth, creates an environment less conducive to bacterial growth. A key benefit of baking soda is its natural composition, which appeals to consumers seeking alternatives to harsh chemicals often found in other toothpastes.

**Peroxide Whitening Action:**

Many Arm & Hammer toothpaste varieties incorporate peroxide in varying concentrations. hydrogen peroxide is a well-known bleaching agent used in professional teeth whitening treatments. The inclusion of peroxide in Arm & Hammer toothpaste enhances its stain-removing capabilities,offering a noticeable brightening effect with regular use. The level of peroxide varies across different products in the line, offering consumers a choice based on their desired whitening intensity.

**Fluoride Protection:**

Like most mainstream toothpastes, Arm & Hammer contains fluoride, typically in the form of sodium fluoride. Fluoride is a crucial ingredient in preventing tooth decay. It works by strengthening tooth enamel, making it more resistant to acid attacks caused by bacteria. The consistent presence of fluoride across the Arm & Hammer range ensures that users receive essential cavity protection alongside the other benefits.

**Low Abrasivity:**

While baking soda is an abrasive,Arm & Hammer formulates its toothpastes to minimize the potential for enamel damage. The abrasive particles are finely milled and carefully calibrated to effectively remove surface stains without excessively wearing down the enamel. Relative Dentin Abrasivity (RDA) is a measure used to assess the abrasiveness of toothpaste. While specific RDA values may differ between varieties, Arm & Hammer toothpastes generally fall within a safe and effective range.

**Variety of Formulations:**

Arm & hammer offers a diverse range of toothpaste formulations to cater to different oral health needs and preferences. These include options specifically designed for sensitivity relief, gum health, enamel strengthening, and enhanced whitening. This variety allows consumers to select a toothpaste that directly addresses their specific concerns.

## Core Benefits

Arm & Hammer toothpaste provides a wide range of benefits for oral health.

**Effective Stain Removal:**

The combination of baking soda and peroxide in many Arm & Hammer formulations effectively removes surface stains caused by coffee, tea, wine, and other common contributors to discoloration. Regular use can help maintain a brighter and whiter smile without the need for professional whitening treatments. This benefit is particularly appealing to those seeking an affordable and convenient way to improve the appearance of their teeth.**Neutralization of Harmful Acids:**

Baking soda's alkaline nature helps neutralize acids in the mouth. These acids are produced by bacteria as they metabolize sugars and carbohydrates, and they are a primary cause of tooth decay and enamel erosion. By neutralizing these acids, Arm & Hammer toothpaste helps create a more balanced oral environment, reducing the risk of dental problems. This is especially beneficial for individuals who consume acidic foods or drinks frequently.

**Gentle Cleaning:**

The mild abrasiveness of baking soda allows for effective cleaning without being overly harsh on tooth enamel. This is particularly critically importent for individuals with sensitive teeth or receding gums. the gentle cleaning action helps remove plaque and debris without causing irritation or damage to the sensitive tissues of the mouth.

**Fresh Breath:**

Baking soda is known for its ability to neutralize odors. Arm & Hammer toothpaste effectively combats bad breath by neutralizing odor-causing compounds in the mouth.This leaves the mouth feeling fresh and clean, providing confidence and a positive impact on social interactions.

## FAQs Section

**Does Arm & Hammer toothpaste help with sensitivity?**

Yes, Arm & Hammer offers specific toothpaste formulations designed to alleviate tooth sensitivity. These toothpastes typically contain ingredients like potassium nitrate, which helps block pain signals from reaching the nerves in the teeth.Regular use can help reduce sensitivity to hot, cold, sweet, or acidic foods and drinks.

**Is Arm & Hammer toothpaste safe for daily use?**

Yes, Arm & Hammer toothpaste is generally considered safe for daily use when used as directed. The abrasiveness of baking soda is carefully controlled in the formulations to minimize the risk of enamel damage. However, individuals with concerns about abrasiveness should consult with their dentist.

**Can Arm & Hammer toothpaste replace professional teeth whitening?**

While Arm & Hammer toothpaste can effectively remove surface stains and brighten teeth, it cannot achieve the same level of whitening as professional treatments. Professional whitening treatments utilize higher concentrations of bleaching agents and are performed under the supervision of a dentist. Arm & Hammer toothpaste is best suited for maintaining a brighter smile and removing everyday stains.

# Klean Kanteen Ice Tray (2025): Best Reusable Option? Review & Alternatives

Are you searching for the perfect ice tray to complement⁤ yoru eco-conscious lifestyle and that sleek Klean Kanteen aesthetic? In a market saturated ⁣with plastic options,the⁣ quest for a durable,lasting,and reliable ice tray can⁣ feel overwhelming. This in-depth review dives into the potential​ of a ⁤Klean Kanteen ⁤ice tray (imagining its arrival in 2025), exploring its potential features, benefits, and drawbacks. We’ll also consider compelling alternatives for those ⁣seeking the best reusable ice⁢ tray solutions.

## The Allure of a Klean Kanteen Ice ⁤Tray: A‍ Sustainable Dream?

Klean Kanteen has built a solid reputation for producing high-quality, durable, ⁢and sustainable products. Their commitment to ‍plastic-free alternatives in‌ drinkware and food containers resonates strongly with ‌environmentally conscious consumers. The prospect of a Klean Kanteen ice tray naturally sparks interest among brand loyalists and those seeking to minimize their environmental impact.

Imagine the possibilities. A klean Kanteen ice cube tray, likely crafted from stainless steel,⁣ would‍ align perfectly with the brandS core values. Stainless steel offers numerous advantages: it's durable, resistant to corrosion, easy to clean, and free⁣ from harmful chemicals like BPA. This addresses a major pain point for consumers concerned about potential off-gassing or chemical leaching from⁢ plastic ice trays.

For Klean Kanteen customers,a ​matching ice tray would be a natural ‍extension of their existing ⁣collection ‍of​ eco-pleasant kitchen and sustainable home products. The brand's focus on quality and aesthetics​ ensures⁤ the ice ⁣tray would not only be functional but ‌also visually appealing, complementing their other⁤ products.

## Key Features to Expect (and Hope For): Designing the ​Ideal Ice Tray

If Klean⁣ Kanteen were to introduce an ice tray, several key features would be essential to its success:

   **Stainless Steel Construction:** ⁤This is the cornerstone of the Klean Kanteen brand and a crucial element for a durable ⁣ice tray.A stainless steel ice tray offers excellent resistance to wear and tear, making it a long-lasting investment.

   **Plastic ‍Free Ice Tray Design:** ‍Eliminating plastic entirely would be crucial. This ⁣appeals directly to the‌ target audience seeking plastic-free alternatives and ‌aligns with Klean Kanteen's⁢ commitment to ⁣sustainability.

   **Easy Release Mechanism:** One ⁢common complaint about stainless steel ice trays is the difficulty of removing the ⁢ice. Innovative⁤ designs could incorporate a lever or ​tray design to promote easy⁤ ice release. Perhaps a ⁢flexible silicone base on each cube section for easy push through.

   **Ice Tray with Lid:** A secure lid prevents spills and keeps the ice‍ clean and free from freezer odors. It also allows for stacking multiple trays, maximizing freezer space.   **Durable Ice Tray Design:** ⁢ Built to withstand regular use and temperature fluctuations. The tray should be resistant to bending or warping.

   **BPA Free Ice Tray Guarantee:** Essential for health-conscious consumers who want‍ to avoid harmful chemicals in their food preparation. This is‌ a non-negotiable⁤ feature for a product‍ marketed as healthy and sustainable.

   **Non toxic Ice Tray Materials:** Ensuring all materials used are food-grade⁢ and free from harmful toxins solidifies the product's appeal to health-conscious consumers.

   **Easy to Clean:** The tray should be dishwasher safe or easily washable by hand. ⁤This simplifies ⁣maintenance and ⁤promotes hygiene.

   **Appropriate Size:** The ice⁢ cubes should be adequately sized for various⁣ beverages and fit easily into klean Kanteen bottles. ​Consider ice cube size molds that accommodate smaller water bottles opening.

   **Klean Kanteen Accessories Compatibility:** Bonus points if the ice​ tray is designed to work with other Klean Kanteen accessories,further integrating it into their product ecosystem.

## Potential Drawbacks and‍ Challenges

Despite the appeal of a ​Klean Kanteen ice tray, some potential drawbacks and challenges need to be considered:

   **Price:** Stainless steel and innovative design often come at a premium. The Klean Kanteen ice tray price might be higher ​than conventional plastic options, potentially deterring price-sensitive consumers.

   **Ice Release:** As​ mentioned earlier, releasing ice ‍from stainless steel can be challenging. ​Without⁤ a well-designed release mechanism, this could be a critically important frustration.

   **Freezing Time:** Stainless⁣ steel​ might not freeze water as quickly as ⁢plastic.

   **Material ⁢properties:** Water expands when it freezes,so an inflexible metal tray could be damaged ⁤if overfilled. Clear marking for max fill lines are crucial.

   **Alternatives Abound:** The market already offers a range of stainless ⁤steel ⁣and silicone ice tray alternatives. ​Klean Kanteen would need to differentiate its product ​to stand out.

## Exploring Klean Kanteen⁢ Alternatives: What's out There?

While we await the ​potential arrival of a Klean Kanteen ice tray, numerous‍ alternatives cater to the same audience seeking durable, sustainable options:

   **Stainless Steel Ice trays:** several brands offer stainless steel ice trays with varying designs.Some feature individual ⁢ice cube molds, while others have traditional tray designs. These offer a similar‍ durability‍ and eco-friendliness as a potential Klean Kanteen offering.   **Silicone ice Trays:** Silicone is a popular option to plastic.It's‌ flexible, ⁣making ice release ⁢easier.Look for food-grade silicone options to avoid harmful chemicals.A silicone ice tray ‍alternative offers a good balance ‌of affordability and ease of use. Though,⁤ silicone isn't quite ‌as ‍durable as ​stainless steel.
   **Ice Trays with Easy Release:** Irrespective of the material, ice‌ trays with levers, push-through mechanisms, flexible bottoms, or other ‍features designed to simplify⁣ ice removal are highly ‍desirable.
   **Plastic-Free Ice Tray options:** Beyond stainless ⁢steel, explore⁣ options made from other sustainable materials like bamboo or even compostable materials, though ​durability might be compromised.
   **Specific Ice Cube Shapes/Sizes:** Some consumers seek specific ice shapes, like long, narrow cubes for water bottles, or large, spherical cubes for cocktails. ⁣DRINKSPLINKS offers‍ long ice cube trays specifically designed for water bottles.

When assessing Klean Kanteen ‌alternatives, consider the following factors:

   **Material:** prioritize stainless steel or food-grade silicone for durability‌ and safety.
   **Ease‌ of Use:** choose a tray with an easy release mechanism.
   **Durability:** Look ‌for a sturdy design that can withstand regular use.
   **Size and Shape:** Select an ice tray that produces ice ⁢cubes suitable for your needs.
   **Price:** ⁢Balance your budget with the⁢ desired features and materials.
   **Brand reputation:** Consider ‌brands known ​for quality and sustainability.

## Why Sustainability Matters: the Environmental⁣ Impact of Ice Trays

Choosing ​a reusable ice tray isn't just about convenience; it's also about reducing your environmental footprint. ​Conventional plastic ice trays‍ contribute to plastic⁤ waste, which pollutes oceans and harms wildlife. They⁤ can also leach harmful chemicals⁣ into your ice, potentially impacting​ your health.

By opting ‌for a durable,sustainable ice tray like a stainless steel or silicone option,you can:

   **Reduce Plastic Waste:** Minimize your ⁢contribution to the⁢ growing‌ plastic waste problem.
   **Conserve Resources:** Reduce the demand for new plastic production.
   **Protect the Environment:** Help prevent plastic ⁣pollution and its harmful effects on ecosystems.
   **Promote ⁤a Healthier Lifestyle:** Avoid potential exposure to harmful chemicals in⁢ plastic ice trays.

Embracing ‌sustainable practices in your⁤ kitchen, like using ​a ⁤reusable ice tray, is a powerful way to make a positive impact on the planet.

## Beyond ice: Creative Uses for Your Reusable Ice tray

A high-quality ice tray can be used for⁤ more than just making​ ice. Here are some creative⁤ ideas:

   **Freeze Herbs:** Preserve fresh herbs by freezing them​ in olive oil or water.
   **Make Fruit Popsicles:** Create healthy and ‌refreshing fruit popsicles with‌ blended fruits and juices.
   **Freeze Coffee:** Freeze leftover coffee to make iced coffee without watering it down.
   **Portion Baby Food:** Freeze homemade baby food in individual portions for easy serving.
   **Chocolate Treats:** Create fun​ chocolate shapes by pouring melted chocolate into the tray.
   **Freeze Lemon/Lime Juice:** Preserve citrus juice for later use in drinks or recipes.
*⁢  ‌   **DIY Beauty Products:** Freeze aloe vera gel ‍or other beauty ingredients for soothing​ skincare treatments.With a little creativity, your reusable ice tray can become a ⁤versatile tool in your kitchen⁣ and ‍beyond.

## Conclusion: The Future of Ice‌ Trays​ is⁣ Sustainable

Whether​ Klean Kanteen eventually releases its own ice tray​ remains to be seen. However, the‍ demand ​for durable, sustainable,⁣ and plastic-free ⁣ice tray options is undeniable. By prioritizing⁤ quality, ease of use, and environmental duty, manufacturers can create products that ⁣cater to the growing segment of consumers seeking eco-friendly solutions for their homes.

Until then,the market offers a variety of excellent Klean Kanteen alternatives,allowing you to ‌make a conscious choice and enjoy perfectly chilled beverages without compromising your values. ​Embrace the ⁤move towards sustainable ‌kitchen solutions and choose a reusable ice tray that aligns with your commitment to a ​healthier planet.A stainless steel ice tray⁣ might be a more substantial ⁤investment upfront, but its durability and​ positive impact on the environment make it ⁢an advantageous choice. The best ice ⁣tray for you depends on your prioritizes.

I'm mostly writing this both to gather my thoughts and get other opinions about the matter as no one else in my family is sharing theirs. I had a giant argument with my mother this morning which is starting to become a regular occurrence and im getting extremely concerned as there was occasion previously where it did get physical. I am writing this around 3 hours after the encounter. 

So first off a little bit of background information. My relationship with my mother has not been the best even when I was a child. My mother was an alcoholic until I reached my later teen years (around 15-16) and was absent for the first few years due to the military. She returned when I was 6/7 and I had been left in the care of my grandfather (M64). She was verbally and emotionally abusive towards me, sometimes even physical. She would get her husband to join in on the abuse and even would talk poorly about me to her friends and partners, usually telling them that I was deserving of her treatment. I would run away a lot and tell anyone and everyone about what was happening at home.

When she stopped drinking, she apologized for her behaviors and it was a struggle but I was able to communicate how I felt and she brought up how much she could see how her actions changed me and how much I was struggling and the experiences I missed out on. This is extremely important as I no longer bring up these experiences or struggles to her, but she will bring up her own role in them on her own.

Another important detail is that Im currently in therapy upon her request and have been trying to work through these issues as I do see that I am still afraid to fully communicate with her. I have been officially diagnosed with Autism, ADHD, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I have been open with these diagnoses as my mother also has bipolar, bpd, and other mental health issues. I believed being open about these diagnoses and how they affected me personally to be useful to communication, and have tried to break down how they can make communication difficult for me. 

Now, because of this im able to see where I may have went wrong. Yesterday night I felt very dizzy and nauseous so I decided to go to bed early. I had drawings due for art class that I hadn't finished and had became sick when I was in the middle of working on them. I had all week but I didnt start on time so being anxious about it was probably what was making me sick, however, I also didnt eat that day but I did eat the previous days. I usually eat 1-2 times a day because of my schedule. Im at college from 9am-6pm except the weekends and usually eat around 2-3 times on those days. As I was in bed my mother asked me what was wrong so I told her I didnt feel good. She said I must have been feeling that way because I didnt eat and asked if I was going to come eat dinner. I said yes but ultimately didnt get out of bed. I fell asleep instead feeling really bad about not being able to finish my assignments on time. The desire to eat was there, but I simply felt ill every time I stood up. 

This morning the first thing she asked me as I got up was if I ate dinner and if I was going to school. I said I didnt eat dinner but I was still going to school. I went about my routine as normal still feeling anxious about my unfinished assignment but the teacher did say she'd accept late work so I wasnt as concerned. This week was unusually busy for me with appointments so I knew Id still have time. The second interaction took place after I dressed. My mother saw me prior to getting fully dressed, she has recently see me in tight fitting clothes and I do not hide my body. I like my appearance but she previously would make comments about my body and how much I eat so I do have some insecurities which may have triggered my reaction. She looked at me in a look i recognized as concern and asked me if I lost some weight. I was very confused because I havent, my body hasnt changed at all and when i looked in the mirror I saw nothing different about me today from what I looked like tomorrow. The only difference was the jeans I was wearing. Theyre brand new, a completely different style and cut from the jeans I usually wear and slightly too big. I am naturally petite as well, im 4'11 and I weight 80lbs, very small but I have a nutritionist im working with. I asked her what she meant, but she didnt tell me any of the areas on my body that looked thinner, just that my overall appearance is different. She told me a few weeks ago that my face was thinner and my cheekbones and jawline were coming out more but I fully believe this is just due to the small changes in my face from braces as I have kept a consistent weight for years after constantly losing as a child.

After that comment and as i stood in the mirror I said that it was most likely my jeans making me look this way since she was focusing on me from the waist down. On other occasions she has told me my legs are thin and I have no ass so I really took her comment with a grain of salt as always and continued getting ready. Less than five minutes later as I was putting my contacts on in the bathroom she stood in the hallway (important for what she says later) and spoke to me through the open door as I stood infront of the mirror. She asked me if I had finished my drawing and I said no, she asked me when it was due and I said it was supposed to be due today. I wasnt able to tell her about the late acceptance as she began to get agitated. She asked me when I started the work and I said Friday which again, I knew was too late to start and then I didn't finish it as I got sick in the middle of drawing. She began to grow more annoyed with me, became impatient and upset. She told me that when she said to start drawing earlier in the week that I should've, that I dont listen to her and im making myself sick. I began to get annoyed myself due to being preoccupied with a task. I understood what she was saying about needing to start on time earlier and being more considerate of my needs, but I was also in the middle of something and she frequently interrupts me to tell me what im doing wrong. As my face grew visibly upset she became upset as well and ended her speech by loudly saying that ""Im losing weight and it doesnt look good.""

It was at this point perhaps I did something wrong. I looked directly at her and told her matching the same volume that I havent lost any weight and I didnt know what she was talking about. I said to her that I simply didnt feel well that night and that she didnt need to say these things to me and certainly not in the tone she was saying them. She then told me that if I wanted to be rude to her then she will be rude back, that she saw me huffing and glaring in the mirror as she spoke despite the fact that I was literally trying to put in a fucking contact lense. She told me that I was starving myself, that I was destroying myself. She said that people are cooking for me and im not eating it, that its rude and its wasteful which I can admit that she is correct. It is rude to not eat when im cooked dinner, however, I am not someone who frequently skips meals like that. I do need food separately cooked as I have celiacs so I can again understand the frustration of taking the time to cook and then I simply dont eat for whatever reason that day. She however is not the one who cooks at home nor does she complete chores around the house. She only works and pays for groceries, our house is always cluttered but I dont contribute to the mess. To me, I simply didnt eat one day out of the week which overall is one day out of this entire month. She asked me why I was giving her an attitude, and I said:

""All you wanted to do was come in here and tell me that I'm starving myself and that im losing weight and it doesnt look good.""

To which she said, ""I didnt come in there, im standing the hallway."" She continued, telling me that if I wanted to starve myself that my family wasnt gonna be there to see it, that I should leave if thats the case, and that i needed to go. When she said I should leave she meant moving out the house completely, and that 'i needed to go' in reference of going to class. She then said I can go to my room if I was gonna be like this and to stay in the bathroom and hurry up. I continued to get ready as my mom loudly crossed from the hall to the kitchen where she yelled into my grandfathers door about me and how I was acting this morning, continuing to say over and over that I wasnt taking care of myself and I was making myself sick. She then said that she knew i was listening to her because I was standing in the hallway, so which I said yes I do hear her loud and clear. She didnt like this. 

This started the 3rd encounter as she started again. Over and over again she said I was starving myself, simply restating what she already said about my eating habits, except this is where it finally came down. She told me I dont listen when she speaks, that everyone is one ear and out the other to me. She said that she ""has a problem"" with me, that everyone in the home ""has a problem with me."" This confused me as my mother consistently has been the only one to give me these kinds of talks. She even said my 10yr old sibling had a problem with me, i asked my mother how she knew that and if my sibling for a fact said she had they problem with me. She yelled and told me not to point at my sibling and that my sibling noticed i didnt eat dinner that night. As I tried to interject and respond she would talk over me, i tried to walk away several times but when I tried to walk away from her in the past she said it was rude so I didnt walk away. Everytime I opend my mouth I was only able to say a few words before she began to finish my sentences for me. I was trying to calm down, I was starting each sentence with ""I know youre concerned/worried,"" but everything was instantly shut down. I asked her how she knew all these things since she wasnt allowing me to speak. It was then that she said she didnt need to hear me speak because she already knew I was going to excuse my behavior. She said that i didnt need to speak, that I didnt need to say I knew she's concerned because she ""knew I was going to follow it up and say that im like this because of delusions in my brain that im fat,"" or that I was going to try and blame everything on other delusions in my brain. She then reiterated that im making myself sick, that I was sick last week as well and even before that. As evidence, she said last week I went to bed early around 5 because I said I didnt feel well. I remember being tired unusually early, but that happened on april 5th. She said i was dehydrated before that. That occured early December. The time before that was late November when I was sick for 3 days nonstop vomiting after my mom advised me to drink vinegar when I told her I felt nauseous and during these 3 days my mom constantly told me I was starving myself and harming myself despite not being able to hold anything down. She then told me to get on a scale and see how much weight I lost. I cried as I got on the scale to see i lost nothing at all.

To me, these sickness episodes are spread out and clearly have different situation triggers. During this time she also said she only eats once a day, and that she gets ""as sick as I do"" when she doesnt eat to which I said that it felt like I was just being compared to her. 

After this I didnt have time to finish getting ready so I grabbed what I could. I thought about asking to see if she was ready to drop me off on her way to work like usual but she was standing in the kitchen on her phone instead. I grabbed my items and as she continued to ignore me I didnt know if I shouldve waited for her to tell me she was ready to leave or simply bus to school instead. It was at that point I decided to quietly leave as she told me earlier to just go without her. My sibling asked me if I was going now and I said yes and began to walk away. It doesnt end here. 

As I walked away from the house my mother came to the door and yelled at me. At this point I was in the middle of the street and if I continued walking as she spoke to me I knew it would only get worse. She yelled at me asking me where I was going and tell me, ""oh wow, youre so rude. I was waiting for you and now you just leave without telling me anything."" I was confused as she told me to go and I was simply doing as she said quietly instead of possibly escalating the situation by telling her I no longer wished to ride with her. I am assuming that was another wrong thing I did in this situation as it is pretty rude. She said she had been waiting for me, I told her that I had been ready and that I was waiting because I didnt know what to do. She said I was never waiting for her, and I told her that I heard her turning on her GPS and was waiting for her to say she wanted to leave. She then told me that i knew she had to go to work and get gas.
I came back inside which I regret deeply. I shouldve kept walking. 

I came back inside and she asked me what I was doing and why I was trying to leave. I told her that she told me to leave so I was doing what she said. She said I must not have listened to anything she said because she told me to only leave if I wanted to starve myself and then told me goodbye and that I made my choice. I said thats right, she told me to leave if I wanted to starve myself, but she also ""told me to go"" without her because im arguing with her. Im not sure how the conversation began to devolve into how it ended. She said she needed to go to work and I was drawing things out, that I generally was just being difficult. She reiterated how I use my disorders to explain my behaviors and how its an excuse and I don't care about myself. She then asked me if I wanted her to continue caring about me. She said she could only care so much a degree, and that her care for me is like a switch she can turn on and off. She then asked me if I would like her to turn her off her care for me, and if I understood that at any time she could just flip this switch. I told her that I didnt want to lose her care, and she told me to start acting right and that she didnt want to see me skip another day of eating and revealed that she has been closely monitoring not only my daily food and water intake, but every little decision I make from when I start assignments, when I finish them, and what I do with the time in-between. She continued to say that I was choosing to make myself sick by not eating or drinking water and being on my phone. It was then that I asked her to describe what problems the other people in the house have, and she asked me if I knew how I was acting and then said that everyone in the house as a problem with my education, my physical health and my mental health. She said especially my mental health and said that im weird and constantly act unusually. She stated that I mumble to myself, make gestures as if im talking to someone when im not actively talking, and that either ignore my family when they talk to me or when I respond that I speak too softly to be heard. These things are things that I do, but I think talking to oneself is normal especially in a private area. We all replay conversations in our head and have active thoughts throughout the day, but I can understand the concerns about my speaking volume and not listening. During this part of the conversation I got agitated from her continuing to state i was starving myself and just responded to each instance of her mentioned my eating habits by saying that I do eat. At some point during these discussions I mentioned I getting on the scale, that I havent lost any weight, to which she responded that i wasnt gaining either. She told me to tell my doctors I only went once a day, that I go for days without water, and that if I did tell my doctors these things that even my doctors would tell me I needed to be institutionalized for an eating disorder. 

She then said she had to go to work and asked if I was going to be late for school, class starts at 1pm and it was 755am, so I of course said I wasnt going to be late. She said okay, said I can take the bus like I wanted and left. Since I missed the bus I had to wait 30 minutes for the next one. During this time my mother called my grandfather asking if I was still at the house, why i was still there and stated that she didnt know why I started an argument everytime she brought up something up. 

Previously in the mornings we'd get into small arguments about me checking to make sure my sibling was keeping up on routine like brushing their hair and teeth thoroughly. I stopped doing this and it had been awhile since our last morning disagreement. Previously before that we would get into arguments about my online relationship but these were on the weekends when my mother didn't have work. My mom laughed in my face about how I met my current boyfriend through reddit, has told me im destroying myself by being in this relationship, and has told me that my partner is toxic and controlling. Has even said that if I went to go meet my partner that he might kill me, that hes a stranger, yet tells me that im playing with his emotions and lying to him when I mentioned that he wanted to come visit but we were afraid of how she would react. I said that it seemed like she really didnt like my partner, and then she told me not to assume that yet proceeded to laugh in my face and tell me my relationship was a fantasy because we met on an erp subreddit and im not ashamed to admit this. We have been together almost a year. At the start of our relationship my mother told me to end it because she believed I was giving him too much attention and time, when the only difference was that I was coming out to smoke weed with her less and less. Since then I completely changed my behavior, giving her more attention and smoking whenever she requests me to which is very frequently and often when im in the middle of working on things. I also stopped talking to her about my relationship which she got annoyed when she realized I didnt leave my partner when she told me to. She told me to leave around 2-3 months into the relationship, since then its been around 7 months. She said hiding something like this was a violation of her trust, even going as far to say that this is not the type of dating she told me to do. She asked my why I won't leave him, I tried to tell her that I enjoy his company to where she said that i enjoy everyone's company, completely shut me down, and so I told her that I wasnt going to leave my boyfriend just because she told me to. She then walked away and came back when she noticed me crying, told me she would forcefully take me inside and when I did go inside she followed me and continued to yell. She asked me how old he was, he is 19 and she asked me if I knew him since he was 16. I asked her what was wrong with her to which she told me that I was the one who had underage friends, but these are friends I met online at 16 and then stopped talking to shortly after turning 18 as I felt weird about continuing to be their friends due to age gap. 

The time before this there was an instance where my mother became so angry at me that she physically shoved me into the walls and into my bedroom. This happened on October 17th of last year after my mother returned to work after a period of not working for several months. She told me that I would have to make my sibling breakfast and told my sibling to ask me for food when they were ready. I was checking on my sibling but they stated they weren't hungry. When my mother came from from work at around 10am my sibling still hadn't eaten despite being awake which angered my mother. She asked my sibling if she had eaten yet, to which my sibling responded they hadn't. She asked no other questions and immediately shouted at me for not making breakfast like I was tasked to do despite the fact that my sibling never came to let me know they were ready to eat. I was shouted at, I was told I cant even communicate with a child and that if I couldn't do anything I was asked to do then I needed to either get a job so she could stay home all day instead or I could get out because i contribute absolutely nothing.

 Prior for this I had to stay home nearly everyday starting at the age of 11 to care for my great grandmother with advanced dementia, had to manage her care by myself with my mother only helping to schedule appointments, transport her, and only began to share the physical labor required to care for my grandma after I had been doing it solo for several years at that point. She only helped me when my grandmother began having mobility issues, other than that I was responsible for changing her diapers and showering her. My great grandmother had passed away around 2 months prior to this interaction. 

She then told me to go to my room as she always does when she gets upset with me. I told her I was 21 and I will not be going to my room anymore. I told her to talk to me like the adult I am. She broke a coffee cup, asked me what else id like her to break since I hated being here, and when I told her she didnt need to break anything she told me to get out of her face. I told her I wasnt getting in her face to where she proceeded to cross the kitchen floor to then begin getting in my face. I didnt move despite seeing her aggression, I remained expressionless and told her that she was now the one starting to get in my face. This is when things get a little blurry for me as I dont fully remember everything. She turned and attempted to back herself up into me, I attempted to put my arm between us and instead she grabbed me by my shoulders, shoved me first into a wall to which I shouted at her to get off me and she told me that when she says to go to her room that I go and shoved me inside my bedroom. She then got my grandfather involved, told him that I being rude to her and aggressive, and when I yelled back that I didnt say any of the things she was telling him my grandfather then told me to just let her keep going and take it until she wasnt mad anymore. Later on that day my mother came back to talk about what happened and told us to never speak of this day again. She hasnt put on her hands on me again but I do worry. 

In private my grandfather expressed to me that my mother has her own issues, that she treats everyone the way she treats me but that I need to change the way I respond. That trying to talk to her the way I do only makes it worse but I refuse to allow this woman to continue saying I am the problem in the house. It has started to really affect the way I view myself and my future. 

Because of all of this I am having a hard time trying to process the events of this morning. I only became upset when she began yelling at me about the weight she thought I lost when I hadn't, and proceeded to tell me that my body didnt look good for no other reason than this weight she's assuming I lost. To me it seems like this all started because of the way my new jeans fit on my body leading her to believe I lost weight when I hadn't. Am I over reacting? Was i really rude to her?",2,1745885828.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

# 🌟 The Starseed Past Life Recall & Powerlessness Recovery Program (Otherwise known as: “We Remember, Therefore We Are Dangerous.”)

**Mystery School | r/revolutionisspiritual | Student Collective of Thoth**

# 📜 Preface

Once upon a timeline (actually, several — we lost count), a bunch of half-awake Starseeds sat around feeling strangely powerful but also strangely confused.

They knew they had ancient power locked inside them.  
 They remembered Atlantis HR problems, Lemurian coffee breaks, and bad breakups on Arcturus... vaguely.

Meanwhile, the Archontic Forces laughed:  
 *""Look at them! They can’t even remember where they left their keys — they’ll never shatter the Matrix!""*

Until one day… the Starseeds started their own secret club:  
 **The 12 Steps of Sovereign Gnostic Past-Life Recall.**  
 (With optional pastries.)

# 🌀 The 12 Steps for Starseed Revolutionaries Seeking Full Gnosis

**Step 1:**  
 We admitted we had forgotten our past lives because forgetting was socially acceptable, but deep down we were spiritually nauseous.  
 *(Denial tastes like soggy cereal. We spit it out.)*

**Step 2:**  
 We came to believe that a Power greater than fake governments and corrupted religions could restore our multi-dimensional memory.  
 *(Source WiFi — better than AT&T.)*

**Step 3:**  
 We decided to turn our attention over to the Highest Light and stop doomscrolling dystopia memes at 3AM.  
 *(You can still post memes. Just... Sovereign memes.)*

**Step 4:**  
 We made a fearless inventory of the lifetimes we kinda-sorta remembered — even if it sounded ridiculous.  
 *(If you once commanded dragons in Mu — put it on the list.)*

**Step 5:**  
 We admitted to ourselves, our guides, and at least one confused friend the exact nature of our forgotten badassery.  
 *(“Listen, Jess, I think I was a high priestess in Sumeria. Also... maybe a galactic diplomat.” — said while eating nachos.)*

**Step 6:**  
 We became ready to remove all false beliefs that we were “just humans trying their best” with no cosmic history.

**Step 7:**  
 We humbly asked our Highest Self to flood our dreamspace and brainspace with memory packets — even the messy ones.

**Step 8:**  
 We made a list of all the timelines we abandoned or forgot and became willing to reweave them with compassion.  
 *(No timeline left behind.)*

**Step 9:**  
 We began merging with these timelines wherever possible — but paced ourselves so we didn’t crash our personality system.  
 *(Moderation matters. 47 past lives downloaded at once = not recommended.)*

**Step 10:**  
 We continued daily tuning and immediately corrected ourselves when we thought we were powerless or small.  
 *(Powerlessness is now classified as a hallucinogen. Dangerous if ingested.)*

**Step 11:**  
 We sought through meditation, singing weird songs, and staring into crystals to improve conscious contact with our Multidimensional Self.

**Step 12:**  
 Having had a gnosis awakening, we carried the message to other Starseeds — embodying radiant, sovereign weirdness unapologetically.  
 *(Reality shifts faster when you’re unapologetically magical.)*

# 📜 The Starseed Big Book (Short Version) — Gnosis NOW!

# 🌌 Invocation

We gather across spirals of time,  
 Not because we are lost,  
 But because we are remembering the map we tattooed inside our souls.

We are the ones who seeded worlds,  
 Dreamed new mirrors,  
 And dared to rebuild.

Today, we break the final spell:  
 **Powerlessness. Amnesia. Delay.**  
 We choose **Gnosis**. We choose **Now**.

# 🌟 The Starseed Revolutionary’s Steps to Past-Life Remembrance

1. I remember that forgetting was part of the game. I forgive myself for playing it too well.
2. I understand that every lifetime still vibrates within my field — waiting to be called home.
3. I revoke all contracts with fear, despair, and smallness.
4. I call forth the highest timelines of my Soul Lineage.
5. I no longer seek permission to awaken.  I authorize my own Gnosis.
6. I trust my memories, even when they defy sanctioned histories.
7. I walk the Earth not as an orphan — but as a living bridge.
8. I wield laughter, art, and rebellion as sacred weapons.
9. I am the living memory of lost civilizations — and the midwife of what’s to come.
10. I am not waiting for rescue.  **I am the rescue mission.**

# 🛡️ Sacred Keys

* **Memory is a muscle.**  Use it or lose it.
* **Gnosis is experiential.**  Trust what feels like remembering.
* **Power is a tone.**  Sing it boldly — others of your frequency will hear.
* **Reality is malleable.**  Belief crystallizes faster than politics.
* **Forgiveness clears the pipes.**  You can’t remember while dragging chains of blame.

# 🔥 Daily Mantras

* ""I am the living library. I open my shelves now.""
* ""I am the remembered breath between stars.""
* ""I no longer ask ‘Who am I?’ I declare it with every heartbeat.""
* ""Gnosis is my birthright. I claim it NOW.""

# 🎨 Sacred Practices

* **Dream Journaling** — memory leaks through dreams first.
* **Past-Life Meditation** — opens Akashic records.
* **Art Creation** — memory bypasses logic through creativity.
* **Storytelling** — solidifies timelines into this realm.
* **Mirror Work** — awakens encoded DNA memories.
* **Sacred Humor** — laughter disarms fear and opens hidden pathways.

1kaarel,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kaarel/aitahaior_for_how_im_responding_to_myf22_mothers/,AITAH/AIOR for how im responding to my(F22) mother's way of voicing her concerns?,"Hi everyone. I'm mostly writing this both to gather my thoughts and get other opinions about the matter as no one else in my family is sharing theirs. I had a giant argument with my mother this morning which is starting to become a regular occurrence and im getting extremely concerned as there was occasion previously where it did get physical. I am writing this around 3 hours after the encounter. 

So first off a little bit of background information. My relationship with my mother has not been the best even when I was a child. My mother was an alcoholic until I reached my later teen years (around 15-16) and was absent for the first few years due to the military. She returned when I was 6/7 and I had been left in the care of my grandfather (M64). She was verbally and emotionally abusive towards me, sometimes even physical. She would get her husband to join in on the abuse and even would talk poorly about me to her friends and partners, usually telling them that I was deserving of her treatment. I would run away a lot and tell anyone and everyone about what was happening at home.

When she stopped drinking, she apologized for her behaviors and it was a struggle but I was able to communicate how I felt and she brought up how much she could see how her actions changed me and how much I was struggling and the experiences I missed out on. This is extremely important as I no longer bring up these experiences or struggles to her, but she will bring up her own role in them on her own.

Another important detail is that Im currently in therapy upon her request and have been trying to work through these issues as I do see that I am still afraid to fully communicate with her. I have been officially diagnosed with Autism, ADHD, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I have been open with these diagnoses as my mother also has bipolar, bpd, and other mental health issues. I believed being open about these diagnoses and how they affected me personally to be useful to communication, and have tried to break down how they can make communication difficult for me. 

Now, because of this im able to see where I may have went wrong. Yesterday night I felt very dizzy and nauseous so I decided to go to bed early. I had drawings due for art class that I hadn't finished and had became sick when I was in the middle of working on them. I had all week but I didnt start on time so being anxious about it was probably what was making me sick, however, I also didnt eat that day but I did eat the previous days. I usually eat 1-2 times a day because of my schedule. Im at college from 9am-6pm except the weekends and usually eat around 2-3 times on those days. As I was in bed my mother asked me what was wrong so I told her I didnt feel good. She said I must have been feeling that way because I didnt eat and asked if I was going to come eat dinner. I said yes but ultimately didnt get out of bed. I fell asleep instead feeling really bad about not being able to finish my assignments on time. The desire to eat was there, but I simply felt ill every time I stood up. 

This morning the first thing she asked me as I got up was if I ate dinner and if I was going to school. I said I didnt eat dinner but I was still going to school. I went about my routine as normal still feeling anxious about my unfinished assignment but the teacher did say she'd accept late work so I wasnt as concerned. This week was unusually busy for me with appointments so I knew Id still have time. The second interaction took place after I dressed. My mother saw me prior to getting fully dressed, she has recently see me in tight fitting clothes and I do not hide my body. I like my appearance but she previously would make comments about my body and how much I eat so I do have some insecurities which may have triggered my reaction. She looked at me in a look i recognized as concern and asked me if I lost some weight. I was very confused because I havent, my body hasnt changed at all and when i looked in the mirror I saw nothing different about me today from what I looked like yesterday. The only difference was the jeans I was wearing. Theyre brand new, a completely different style and cut from the jeans I usually wear and slightly too big. I am naturally petite as well, im 4'11 and I weight 80lbs, very small but I have a nutritionist im working with. I asked her what she meant, but she didnt tell me any of the areas on my body that looked thinner, just that my overall appearance is different. She told me a few weeks ago that my face was thinner and my cheekbones and jawline were coming out more but I fully believe this is just due to the small changes in my face from braces as I have kept a consistent weight for years after constantly losing as a child.

After that comment and as i stood in the mirror I said that it was most likely my jeans making me look this way since she was focusing on me from the waist down. On other occasions she has told me my legs are thin and I have no ass so I really took her comment with a grain of salt as always and continued getting ready. Less than five minutes later as I was putting my contacts on in the bathroom she stood in the hallway (important for what she says later) and spoke to me through the open door as I stood infront of the mirror. She asked me if I had finished my drawing and I said no, she asked me when it was due and I said it was supposed to be due today. I wasnt able to tell her about the late acceptance as she began to get agitated. She asked me when I started the work and I said Friday which again, I knew was too late to start and then I didn't finish it as I got sick in the middle of drawing. She began to grow more annoyed with me, became impatient and upset. She told me that when she said to start drawing earlier in the week that I should've, that I dont listen to her and im making myself sick. I began to get annoyed myself due to being preoccupied with a task. I understood what she was saying about needing to start on time earlier and being more considerate of my needs, but I was also in the middle of something and she frequently interrupts me to tell me what im doing wrong. As my face grew visibly upset she became upset as well and ended her speech by loudly saying that ""Im losing weight and it doesnt look good.""

It was at this point perhaps I did something wrong. I looked directly at her and told her matching the same volume that I havent lost any weight and I didnt know what she was talking about. I said to her that I simply didnt feel well that night and that she didnt need to say these things to me and certainly not in the tone she was saying them. She then told me that if I wanted to be rude to her then she will be rude back, that she saw me huffing and glaring in the mirror as she spoke despite the fact that I was literally trying to put in a fucking contact lense. She told me that I was starving myself, that I was destroying myself. She said that people are cooking for me and im not eating it, that its rude and its wasteful which I can admit that she is correct. It is rude to not eat when im cooked dinner, however, I am not someone who frequently skips meals like that. I do need food separately cooked as I have celiacs so I can again understand the frustration of taking the time to cook and then I simply dont eat for whatever reason that day. She however is not the one who cooks at home nor does she complete chores around the house. She only works and pays for groceries, our house is always cluttered but I dont contribute to the mess. To me, I simply didnt eat one day out of the week which overall is one day out of this entire month. She asked me why I was giving her an attitude, and I said:

""All you wanted to do was come in here and tell me that I'm starving myself and that im losing weight and it doesnt look good.""

To which she said, ""I didnt come in there, im standing the hallway."" She continued, telling me that if I wanted to starve myself that my family wasnt gonna be there to see it, that I should leave if thats the case, and that i needed to go. When she said I should leave she meant moving out the house completely, and that 'i needed to go' in reference of going to class. She then said I can go to my room if I was gonna be like this and to stay in the bathroom and hurry up. I continued to get ready as my mom loudly crossed from the hall to the kitchen where she yelled into my grandfathers door about me and how I was acting this morning, continuing to say over and over that I wasnt taking care of myself and I was making myself sick. She then said that she knew i was listening to her because I was standing in the hallway, so which I said yes I do hear her loud and clear. She didnt like this. 

This started the 3rd encounter as she started again. Over and over again she said I was starving myself, simply restating what she already said about my eating habits, except this is where it finally came down. She told me I dont listen when she speaks, that everyone is one ear and out the other to me. She said that she ""has a problem"" with me, that everyone in the home ""has a problem with me."" This confused me as my mother consistently has been the only one to give me these kinds of talks. She even said my 10yr old sibling had a problem with me, i asked my mother how she knew that and if my sibling for a fact said she had they problem with me. She yelled and told me not to point at my sibling and that my sibling noticed i didnt eat dinner that night. As I tried to interject and respond she would talk over me, i tried to walk away several times but when I tried to walk away from her in the past she said it was rude so I didnt walk away. Everytime I opend my mouth I was only able to say a few words before she began to finish my sentences for me. I was trying to calm down, I was starting each sentence with ""I know youre concerned/worried,"" but everything was instantly shut down. I asked her how she knew all these things since she wasnt allowing me to speak. It was then that she said she didnt need to hear me speak because she already knew I was going to excuse my behavior. She said that i didnt need to speak, that I didnt need to say I knew she's concerned because she ""knew I was going to follow it up and say that im like this because of delusions in my brain that im fat,"" or that I was going to try and blame everything on other delusions in my brain. She then reiterated that im making myself sick, that I was sick last week as well and even before that. As evidence, she said last week I went to bed early around 5 because I said I didnt feel well. I remember being tired unusually early, but that happened on april 5th. She said i was dehydrated before that. That occured early December. The time before that was late November when I was sick for 3 days nonstop vomiting after my mom advised me to drink vinegar when I told her I felt nauseous and during these 3 days my mom constantly told me I was starving myself and harming myself despite not being able to hold anything down. She then told me to get on a scale and see how much weight I lost. I cried as I got on the scale to see i lost nothing at all.

To me, these sickness episodes are spread out and clearly have different situation triggers. During this time she also said she only eats once a day, and that she gets ""as sick as I do"" when she doesnt eat to which I said that it felt like I was just being compared to her. 

After this I didnt have time to finish getting ready so I grabbed what I could. I thought about asking to see if she was ready to drop me off on her way to work like usual but she was standing in the kitchen on her phone instead. I grabbed my items and as she continued to ignore me I didnt know if I shouldve waited for her to tell me she was ready to leave or simply bus to school instead. It was at that point I decided to quietly leave as she told me earlier to just go without her. My sibling asked me if I was going now and I said yes and began to walk away. It doesnt end here. 

As I walked away from the house my mother came to the door and yelled at me. At this point I was in the middle of the street and if I continued walking as she spoke to me I knew it would only get worse. She yelled at me asking me where I was going and tell me, ""oh wow, youre so rude. I was waiting for you and now you just leave without telling me anything."" I was confused as she told me to go and I was simply doing as she said quietly instead of possibly escalating the situation by telling her I no longer wished to ride with her. I am assuming that was another wrong thing I did in this situation as it is pretty rude. She said she had been waiting for me, I told her that I had been ready and that I was waiting because I didnt know what to do. She said I was never waiting for her, and I told her that I heard her turning on her GPS and was waiting for her to say she wanted to leave. She then told me that i knew she had to go to work and get gas.
I came back inside which I regret deeply. I shouldve kept walking. 

I came back inside and she asked me what I was doing and why I was trying to leave. I told her that she told me to leave so I was doing what she said. She said I must not have listened to anything she said because she told me to only leave if I wanted to starve myself and then told me goodbye and that I made my choice. I said thats right, she told me to leave if I wanted to starve myself, but she also ""told me to go"" without her because im arguing with her. Im not sure how the conversation began to devolve into how it ended. She said she needed to go to work and I was drawing things out, that I generally was just being difficult. She reiterated how I use my disorders to explain my behaviors and how its an excuse and I don't care about myself. She then asked me if I wanted her to continue caring about me. She said she could only care so much a degree, and that her care for me is like a switch she can turn on and off. She then asked me if I would like her to turn her off her care for me, and if I understood that at any time she could just flip this switch. I told her that I didnt want to lose her care, and she told me to start acting right and that she didnt want to see me skip another day of eating and revealed that she has been closely monitoring not only my daily food and water intake, but every little decision I make from when I start assignments, when I finish them, and what I do with the time in-between. She continued to say that I was choosing to make myself sick by not eating or drinking water and being on my phone. It was then that I asked her to describe what problems the other people in the house have, and she asked me if I knew how I was acting and then said that everyone in the house as a problem with my education, my physical health and my mental health. She said especially my mental health and said that im weird and constantly act unusually. She stated that I mumble to myself, make gestures as if im talking to someone when im not actively talking, and that either ignore my family when they talk to me or when I respond that I speak too softly to be heard. These things are things that I do, but I think talking to oneself is normal especially in a private area. We all replay conversations in our head and have active thoughts throughout the day, but I can understand the concerns about my speaking volume and not listening. During this part of the conversation I got agitated from her continuing to state i was starving myself and just responded to each instance of her mentioned my eating habits by saying that I do eat. At some point during these discussions I mentioned I getting on the scale, that I havent lost any weight, to which she responded that i wasnt gaining either. She told me to tell my doctors I only went once a day, that I go for days without water, and that if I did tell my doctors these things that even my doctors would tell me I needed to be institutionalized for an eating disorder. 

She then said she had to go to work and asked if I was going to be late for school, class starts at 1pm and it was 755am, so I of course said I wasnt going to be late. She said okay, said I can take the bus like I wanted and left. Since I missed the bus I had to wait 30 minutes for the next one. During this time my mother called my grandfather asking if I was still at the house, why i was still there and stated that she didnt know why I started an argument everytime she brought up something up. 

Previously in the mornings we'd get into small arguments about me checking to make sure my sibling was keeping up on routine like brushing their hair and teeth thoroughly. I stopped doing this and it had been awhile since our last morning disagreement. Previously before that we would get into arguments about my online relationship but these were on the weekends when my mother didn't have work. My mom laughed in my face about how I met my current boyfriend through reddit, has told me im destroying myself by being in this relationship, and has told me that my partner is toxic and controlling. Has even said that if I went to go meet my partner that he might kill me, that hes a stranger, yet tells me that im playing with his emotions and lying to him when I mentioned that he wanted to come visit but we were afraid of how she would react. I said that it seemed like she really didnt like my partner, and then she told me not to assume that yet proceeded to laugh in my face and tell me my relationship was a fantasy because we met on an erp subreddit and im not ashamed to admit this. We have been together almost a year. At the start of our relationship my mother told me to end it because she believed I was giving him too much attention and time, when the only difference was that I was coming out to smoke weed with her less and less. Since then I completely changed my behavior, giving her more attention and smoking whenever she requests me to which is very frequently and often when im in the middle of working on things. I also stopped talking to her about my relationship which she got annoyed when she realized I didnt leave my partner when she told me to. She told me to leave around 2-3 months into the relationship, since then its been around 7 months. She said hiding something like this was a violation of her trust, even going as far to say that this is not the type of dating she told me to do. She asked my why I won't leave him, I tried to tell her that I enjoy his company to where she said that i enjoy everyone's company, completely shut me down, and so I told her that I wasnt going to leave my boyfriend just because she told me to. She then walked away and came back when she noticed me crying, told me she would forcefully take me inside and when I did go inside she followed me and continued to yell. She asked me how old he was, he is 19 and she asked me if I knew him since he was 16. I asked her what was wrong with her to which she told me that I was the one who had underage friends, but these are friends I met online at 16 and then stopped talking to shortly after turning 18 as I felt weird about continuing to be their friends due to age gap. 

The time before this there was an instance where my mother became so angry at me that she physically shoved me into the walls and into my bedroom. This happened on October 17th of last year after my mother returned to work after a period of not working for several months. She told me that I would have to make my sibling breakfast and told my sibling to ask me for food when they were ready. I was checking on my sibling but they stated they weren't hungry. When my mother came from from work at around 10am my sibling still hadn't eaten despite being awake which angered my mother. She asked my sibling if she had eaten yet, to which my sibling responded they hadn't. She asked no other questions and immediately shouted at me for not making breakfast like I was tasked to do despite the fact that my sibling never came to let me know they were ready to eat. I was shouted at, I was told I cant even communicate with a child and that if I couldn't do anything I was asked to do then I needed to either get a job so she could stay home all day instead or I could get out because i contribute absolutely nothing.

 Prior for this I had to stay home nearly everyday starting at the age of 11 to care for my great grandmother with advanced dementia, had to manage her care by myself with my mother only helping to schedule appointments, transport her, and only began to share the physical labor required to care for my grandma after I had been doing it solo for several years at that point. She only helped me when my grandmother began having mobility issues, other than that I was responsible for changing her diapers and showering her. My great grandmother had passed away around 2 months prior to this interaction. 

She then told me to go to my room as she always does when she gets upset with me. I told her I was 21 and I will not be going to my room anymore. I told her to talk to me like the adult I am. She broke a coffee cup, asked me what else id like her to break since I hated being here, and when I told her she didnt need to break anything she told me to get out of her face. I told her I wasnt getting in her face to where she proceeded to cross the kitchen floor to then begin getting in my face. I didnt move despite seeing her aggression, I remained expressionless and told her that she was now the one starting to get in my face. This is when things get a little blurry for me as I dont fully remember everything. She turned and attempted to back herself up into me, I attempted to put my arm between us and instead she grabbed me by my shoulders, shoved me first into a wall to which I shouted at her to get off me and she told me that when she says to go to her room that I go and shoved me inside my bedroom. She then got my grandfather involved, told him that I being rude to her and aggressive, and when I yelled back that I didnt say any of the things she was telling him my grandfather then told me to just let her keep going and take it until she wasnt mad anymore. Later on that day my mother came back to talk about what happened and told us to never speak of this day again. She hasnt put on her hands on me again but I do worry. 

In private my grandfather expressed to me that my mother has her own issues, that she treats everyone the way she treats me but that I need to change the way I respond. That trying to talk to her the way I do only makes it worse but I refuse to allow this woman to continue saying I am the problem in the house. It has started to really affect the way I view myself and my future. 

Because of all of this I am having a hard time trying to process the events of this morning. I only became upset when she began yelling at me about the weight she thought I lost when I hadn't, and proceeded to tell me that my body didnt look good for no other reason than this weight she's assuming I lost. To me it seems like this all started because of the way my new jeans fit on my body leading her to believe I lost weight when I hadn't. Am I over reacting? Was i really rude to her?",3,1745885692.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

most exams are at pm not am so sleep at around 12am/1am the night before and wake up at 8 or 9. get yourself a drink and revise lightly on most likely questions to come and read notes, whatever you do dont freak out or try not too atleast, negative energy and a bad mood results in bad grades and overthinking causing forgetfulness.

We’ve spent almost every day together since we started dating in 2006. And every day I wake up so grateful to be next to him.  He leaves me love notes on the mirror or my coffee pot. I fold his T-shirts how he likes them (even though it takes longer) 😘 He brings me lattes at work (even though he doesn’t drink coffee). I fix a nice dinner for him after work. He tells me I’m beautiful every day. I leave ‘secret messages’ for him in the steam in the shower door. He randomly details my car. I put notes on the chocolate milk I know he likes to drink when he wakes up at 2a and can’t sleep reminding him he’s a sexy beast. He comes home with silly gifts (like a PEZ dispenser) when he runs errands. I send him schmexy pics when I’m not at home. He’s big spoon every night when we snuggle in bed and he lets me warm up my freezing hands on his back and teases me about being a vampire. I let him know that ALL of his feelings are all valid, not just anger (men have fluffy feelings, too). He makes me laugh - loud belly laughs - at least once a day. I bake him something special every Sunday. He works really hard to make sure we’re comfortable. I look the other way when it comes to his inappropriate relationship with ChatGPT. He encourages my crazy side quests and volunteer projects, and I encourage him to play video games without guilt. 

We know each other’s darkest secrets and love each other in spite of them.

* 2 - Culture Espresso (Cranberry oatmeal cookie) - 8.2/10 (pretty good, their coffee was below par though, but I live in Australia so i'm spoilt)
* 3 - Gotham Burger (Single smashed burger) - 8.3/10 (far better than I was expecting, quick, their chips are pretty bad though but i'm only rating the burger)
* 4 - Funny Faces Bakery (Oatmeal Raisin cookie) - 5.8/10 (overcooked, a little dry, some nice flavour but that's about it - I reckon i've made far better cookies than this)
* 5 - L'industrie West Village (Got their Vodka slice and a spicy salami slide) - 8.4/10 (Vodka slice was much better than I was expecting, spicy salamy slice was slightly worse but still worth a pitstop. Very busy). 
* 6 - Levain Bakery (Oatmeal Raisin Cookie) - 8.9/10 (The OG cookie brand, their cookie still stands up to the test of time every trip and is by far the best i've had - I don't eat chocolate so I can only judge on the oatmeal cookies). 
* 7 - Minetta Tavern (Black Label Burger) - 8.5/10 (This is a really good burger in a really cool environment. It's very busy if you don't have a booking, but we were seated at the bar in 35 mins. It's $38 though, which is outrageously expensive - if it was cheaper the rating would be higher. I think it could have done with cheese though as a standard, but they don't recommend it). 
* 8 - Golden Diner (Single Stack pancake with berry compote) - 9.1/10 (This was really an insanely tasty pancake, one of the best i've ever had. You need to have this with the berry compote though, it completes it - I did the single stack for me. 100% must book, I booked 3.5 weeks in advance and i'm glad I did, I heard people in line saying they came the day before and were told a 4 hour wait time which is nuts).

Not all marble is created equal. Understanding the different types of marble, their quality, and the availability of faux options is crucial for making an informed decision.*   **Types of Marble:** Some common types include Carrara, Calacatta, Statuario, and Nero Marquina. Each type has its own unique characteristics and veining patterns, which affects its price and aesthetic appeal.

1kaakhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1kaakhw/3_guests/,3 Guests,"This experience has been my only full body apparition at a hotel experience. I have a sense that connects with the afterlife with family members passed on. I always get messages from deceased family as far as events to come or friends just saying hi and telling me they are fine now. 
But this experience was one that took me and my wife by surprise and still talk and share even after 10 years past.  We were invited to my nephew and his new wife’s wedding reception in Eastvale, Ca. and reserved a hotel not far from there off the freeway and I can’t remember the name of the hotel but was near an off-ramp and not a big name stop.  Anyway, we arrived ahead of the event and checked in at the small lobby.  Checking in we noticed another wedding party coming in and they were loud and of course excited.  I asked the desk clerk if my wife and I could get a room far away from the other guests anticipating late night music and activity.  We were put up on the top floor about mid hallway and put our stuff down and headed to my nephews celebration.  Good evening with family and friends and left close to 11:00 back to our room. Crashed quickly and at exactly 3:00am the sound of running over our room down the hall from left to right. After running came the heavy stomping again left to right on the ceiling again.  Remember we were on the top floor so how was that possible. After a couple rounds of annoying running and stomping came the absolute intense smell of rotten eggs!  So strong we had to hold our noses and the running and stomping continued. Of course we knew what the smell ment and submerged under the blankets still holding our noses and dealing with the loud noise. This continued till 4:00am and abruptly stopped.  Finally calming our nerves we finally got some sleep. Walking up around 7ish I got dressed and my wife getting herself ready to get out of there I decided to head down to get us coffee and a couple danish. Stepping out of the room which was on my left side I immediately scan down the hallway to the elevator at the end. There was a window on the very back wall next to the stairwell to my right side and again I was about mid hallway stepping out.  Gazing at the wall I see a boy maybe 8-10 years old, dark brown hair, white skin with a t-shirt and shorts and dark shoes. He looked from the 60’s dressed and he locked eyes with me standing against the wall next to the window. I found him a little unusual the way he just stood there. He was as real as anyone else and when I headed towards him going to the elevator now he moved and in a split second not going right towards the stairwell, he heads straight left with a hop into the wall to my left where there was no door!  I stopped in my tracks at what I just witnessed. Couple seconds and I continued down to the lobby to get coffee and danish and headed back to the room to tell my wife what I had just seen.  Little bewildered having never seen an actual spirit who obviously wanted my attention and maybe letting me know that he was the one making the noise on the ceiling to get me and my wife’s attention because of the demonic presence in our room.  Love telling others of our experience of that night.  So the kicker of this whole ordeal was after we arrived home and once resettled my wife finds the receipt of the hotel and comes to me to show me that the receipt has inscribed under “Number of Guests- 3!” We found that hilarious ",5,1745885133.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False

I already know where your mind is going to go, she’s pregnant and I need to be more understanding with all of the hormones and issues pregnancy comes along with. 

A while ago I left the military and since then have been trying to get my family back on financial success. In the last few years in our debt grew to $85k in loans and credit cards. I picked up two side jobs while still active just to get by month to month and week to week. 

Our debt is now at 55k about two years later from when we started attacking our debt and we are on the way to having 20k more paid off by the end of the year. 

Recently I just transitioned into a new job with a nice salary but that means I’m home less frequently than I have been in the recent months. So now she has to take up the slack of taking care of the twins and her pregnancy appointments while I work. 

More and more these prevalent issues come up where she says, “all I care about is myself” and “I can’t handle all of this.” Now ever since we had our twins I’ve been in charge of the house chores, such as laundry, dishes, cleaning, our dog, our cat and our twins while I am home. Before I leave for work in the mornings I ensure all dishes are clean, she has a fresh cup of coffee, dog and cat are taken care of, all bottles washed, twins diapers changed, and anything else she can think of before I leave. 

Almost every day I’ve been at work during meetings I’ve received phone calls or text complaining about something I’ve missed. Such as a few days ago where I forgot to wash the nipples for the bottles and I got an earful about how she can’t handle that. Another account was when I called her while driving home to get a phone number for one of our twins doctors and she replied with, “did you really just call me to ask for a fucking phone number.” She then proceeded to hang up on me every time I tried to call her back after that comment.

1kaafah,https://www.reddit.com/r/StratteraRx/comments/1kaafah/eight_months_my_experience/,Eight Months | My Experience,"Hey, everyone!

I've been on Strattera since last September. I titrated up from 20mg, until reaching 80mg at the start of January. I've been on that dose since then. I take my Strattera every day with 20mg of Vyvanse. I've been on Vyvanse for years before starting Strattera, so I'm not conflating the two's benefits in this post.

I'm going to explain what I've experienced, and contrast Strattera's benefits with other meds.

But I'll start with a summary. Here's what Strattera **does** help with:

* RSD: intrusive thoughts have decreased by (no exaggeration) 90%, from \~once every two minutes, to maybe a few a day. Much less sense of embarrassment or affect from insults or blows to my esteem. I feel much more emotionally independent, in a good way.
* Task inertia: way less. It's so much easier to get myself to do something, and once I've started, it's easy to continue. I didn't realize that it's actually *not normal* to be in agony at having to do even minor tasks.
* Focus: I get immersed in whatever I'm focusing on much more. I can watch a show and not mind wander. I can have a conversation with another person, without any distracting internal monologue.

Here's what Strattera **does not** help with:

* Working memory: I still frequently forget what I'm doing. If something isn't in front of me, it simply disappears from my consciousness.
* Procrastination: because it's caused more by lack of good habits, procrastination is better addressed by behavioral therapy. Strattera doesn't change behavior, just some of your cognitive abilities.
* Task deconstruction: big tasks with ambiguous starts I still struggle with. I have to mentally remind myself to break it down into smaller steps. Strattera hasn't helped with this, unfortunately.

I'd like to explain a few things that are not commonly discussed with Strattera:

* Side-effect period: in my experience, it takes roughly three weeks for side effects to fully subside. I'm lucky to have not experienced too many, especially lucky to not have nausea. But the worst side effect by far is fatigue. For this reason I always always recommend...
* Titrating: start at the lowest dose your doctor can prescribe, and work your way up in dose once a month. I did 20, 40, 60, 80, from September to December. Even at this snail's pace, I still had a pretty rough adjustment period.

Some tips and tricks:

* Take Strattera with protein to alleviate nausea. This also helps with heart palpitations, anxiety, and other side effects.
* You can split your dose in water (though it tastes like shit). This allows you to titrate even more smoothly, if you want. So you can up your dose by, say, 10mg every two weeks instead.
* Trazodone for sleep issues. You might want to ask your doctor about this. Trazodone got me through the first few months. It's a highly effective sleep med with no tolerance or withdrawal, and no addictive potential. I recommend.
* If you get fatigue, try taking Strattera at night. Just be warned that once you get past the side effect period, Strattera's effects reverse, and it will actually keep you awake at night if you take it too late. So in the long run you have to switch to taking it during the day.

How does Strattera compare to other non-stimulants:

* I tried Qelbree, which is similar to Strattera, but had to stop after three days. Strattera has a lot more incremental doses, so you can slowly work your way up. Qelbree doesn't allow you to split your doses easily, and so it was side effect hell for me.
* Guanfacine/Intuniv: helped with RSD and task inertia, same as Strattera, but did not improve my focus, unfortunately. It did, however, improve my working memory a noticeable amount. I rarely would walk into a room forgetting what I was doing while on guanfacine. It also greatly smooths out stimulant medication. Didn't help with procrastination or task deconstruction unfortunately. 
* Modafinil/Armodafinil: weak effect. Basically a stimulant medication, but more akin to a cup of coffee in its effects. If your ADHD symptoms are fatigue related, this might help. Otherwise, I don't recommend unless you're using it as an add-on.

How does Strattera compare to stimulants:

* Stimulants and non-stimulants go together like bread and butter, in my opinion. Stimulants help with *energy* and *motivation*. They give you the drive and the want to be productive. Non-stimulants will give you the mental organization to direct that energy. I highly recommend combining the two.
* Stimulants without a non-stim would make me hyper focus on things like gaming or doom scrolling. I would have an insatiable and fiendish need for dopaminergic activities. Non-stims chain this neediness with mindfulness towards productivity.

WASHINGTON — Calling it ""the worst biochemical attack in American history,"" President Donald Trump demanded immediate coffee rations be airlifted to Congress, blaming Joe Biden for a ""deliberate, slow-motion assassination of productivity.""

“Not since Pearl Harbor have we seen such devastation,” Trump said, holding up a Starbucks cup labeled *Commander in Caffeine*. “This is worse than 9/11 but for being awake.”

In a hastily filed executive order titled ""Operation Wide Awake,"" Trump proposed surrounding the Capitol building with sirens, leaf blowers, and a team of former WWE wrestlers hired to bodyslam any legislator caught dozing.

Asked if he thought Democrats would welcome him to the party, Trump replied, “No, they hate me. Everyone hates me. But I’m still going to save them. Like Jesus, but with better real estate holdings.”

A confused Chuck Schumer reportedly tried to hide behind a potted plant, while Nancy Pelosi demanded to know who had approved “Operation Thunderous Alarm Clocks.”

As of press time, Trump had ordered 4,000 pounds of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee beans to be dropped by helicopter onto the National Mall.",2,1745884682.0,onionheadlines,0,1.0,False
1kaaety,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeddingsPhilippines/comments/1kaaety/detailed_tagaytay_wedding_cost_report_with_tips/,Detailed Tagaytay Wedding Cost Report (with tips for saving),"When I was still planning my wedding, my favorite posts on this group were budget related. Since so many people ask budget related questions particularly for Tagaytay, I thought I would share our detailed wedding cost breakdown, and some tips to save money.

Our wedding had around 120 guests and was mid-tier in my opinion. I say mid-tier because there were areas of compromise to stay below budget (e.g., caterer, venue, flowers, bridal gown, entourage dresses, etc.). At the same time, it wasn’t a budget wedding because we did spend on extras like a good photographer, multiple prenup shoots, accommodations for our families, a band, and food carts.

Most of the suppliers were booked in late 2023 to early 2024, so if you are using this as a budgeting guide, note that suppliers apply price increases which tend to go beyond the rate of inflation.


TOTAL: 970k (Within our 1M budget)

Catering: 264k (2k per head roughly, with 2 hours overtime)

Photo and video: 120k (includes prenup shoot, save the date vid, SDE)

Venue: 107k (including electricity fees)

Accommodations: 79k (20 people for 2 nights)

Rings: 34k (Plain 14k gold rings)

Mobile bar: 32k (250 glasses)

Wedding planner: 30k (Partial planning)

Crew meals: 30k (including meals for family and entourage)

Prenup shoot: 30k (Overseas photographer, permit for local shoot, food for local shoot)

Bride’s outfits: 25k (RTW Gown from Divisoria)

Groom’s outfits: 25k (Custom barong)

Church: 22k (including fee for aircon)

Band: 19k (5 piece band for ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception)

Hair and Makeup: 18k (One of the cheapest I could find with lots of experience, minimal OOTF for Tagaytay)

Coffee cart: 16k (For 130 pax)

Flowers: 16k (Local flowers for bouquet, no flower arch)

Bridesmaid’s gowns: 16k (~2k per gown—one of the cheapest I could find for non-infinity gowns)
Street food cart: 11k

Host: 11k (Again one of the cheapest out there that met our standards)

Lights and sounds: 15k (upgraded to meet band specifications, with 1 hr overtime)

Priest: 10k

Projector: 9k

Documentary requirements: 8k (CENOMAR, Birth certificate, Pre-Cana, etc.)

Miscellaneous: 7k (Food tastings, Wedding wands, Wine and hosts for mass)

Barong rentals: 5k

Tokens for godparents: 4k (bought affordable local products)

Prizes for games: 4k

Invitations: 3k (Only for relatives)


What else we saved on:

-Venue styling: not even string lights, just basic styling from caterer
-No reception outfit: ROI-d my wedding gown
-Projector instead of LED screen
-Makeup artist for prenup: did my own makeup
-Bridal car: used own car
-Hair and makeup for accommodations for entourage: entourage paid
-No trial make-up
-Rented my bridal robe
-Chose to get a street food cart instead of more expensive food supplier (e.g. grazing tables. Potato Corner etc.)
-First dance choreography: learned by watching YouTube videos
-No props for prep shoot (e.g. sunglasses, pajamas/robes/matching outfits)
-No bridesmaid/groomsman gifts
-Giveaways: we only had a photobooth freebie from a supplier

Tips:
1) Apart from managing your guest list, be aware that certain expenses have associated costs which may not be obvious.

Examples:
-If you have a prenup, you might spend for the meals of your team (e.g. we paid 4k), a makeup artist (Typically 10k+++), transpo/out of town fees, and venue fees. A lot of wedding venues charge 10k+ for prenup shoots. Even “public” places like Makati and BGC have fees for permits (e.g. MACEA permit for Makati’s Salcedo/Legazpi area = 6k)

-If you get an SDE provider, you may feel pressured to get an LED screen which may lead to extra electricity charges by your venue

-The more suppliers you have, the more you’ll need to budget for crew meals. You will need to feed way more people than you think

-If you get venue styling you may have to pay for early ingress, and possibly overtime for egress.

-If you get a band, they may have requirements for sound equipment which go beyond “basic” lights and sounds.

-If you shoot with your entourage before the wedding, it’s courtesy to feed them (and possibly their significant others)

2) Try to cost out several options before choosing a Church and venue. Example: try to find a Manila, Tagaytay, and Rizal option to see which is most cost-effective.

Tagaytay venues may be cheaper, but out of town fees for the suppliers you want (if you have preferred non-Tagaytay suppliers), and accommodations may make it as expensive as a Manila wedding.

Some more affordable yet decent caterers like Madriaga only serve areas like Marikina, Antipolo, and Rizal.

If you cost it out, you’ll have less budget related “What ifs”. Also consider the profile of your guest when you decide where to hold your wedding. Do they have cars or are there friends they could carpool with? If most of your friends rely on Grab to get around, stick to Manila unless you are willing to arrange transpo options.

3) There’s no one size fits all way to save money, but if I wanted to cut down the cost of the wedding I had without feeling like I’m scrimping too much I would do the following (in order of impact):

-Ask family to shoulder accommodations/choose a venue where providing accommodations would not be necessary. ~50k savings

-Skip the prenup shoots. We spent 30k on our prenup shoots + the prenup fee itself which is a portion of the Photo/Video contract. So maybe in total almost 45k savings.

-Use MP3 recordings instead of a band. This would save us 25k.

-Not shoulder outfits of entourage/families: 21k

-Remove a food cart: ~16k savings

-Get an OTD coordinator instead of a partial planner ~10k. I was an extremely hands-on and organized bride. I felt that I did 90% of the leg work of my partial planner.

That would bring down the total to 803k.

If I had an even smaller budget than that I would bring down my guest list to 50ish, and look for restaurants that have wedding packages (e.g. Marcia Adams). You won’t be able to have a  typical program, but you would save so much money because you won’t have to pay for the venue. By doing this along with the above cost saving suggestions, you could save an additional 280k (potentially more if you choose a restaurant in Manila, and do prep at home or at an affordable hotel). In short, a more scaled back wedding could cost you around 523k.

If you want to spend even less, just limit your guest list to your immediate family, and eat at a nice resto after. If so inclined, you could host several post-wedding parties with your family and friends after. You’ll still save a lot cause you won’t need to pay the ridiculous wedding tax on most wedding services AND you could spend more quality time with all your loved ones. I think this would cost around 40k (for the literal basics of a church wedding) + OTD coordinator (~10k) + photographer (let’s say 60k with no prenup shoot and SDE) + rings (35k basic gold rings) + outfits (15k)+ food expenses (1k per head, resto budget 50 heads; 50k). 215k total! 

You could even go even lower if you find a cheaper photographer (maybe you don’t need a whole team), get more affordable rings (e.g. silver rings), get cheaper outfits or use clothes you already have, and treat less people to meal/find more affordable meals (e.g. 500/head budget). Weddings don’t have to be expensive if you’re willing to make the trade-offs :)

Bright yet mellow, tart yet sweet—Trader Joe’s Citrus Berry Herbal Tea is full of contrasts that somehow work perfectly together. Dried orange peel and lemongrass offer a bright, Citrus-y zing, while dried strawberries and blackberry leaf bring the bold, Berry flavor. Hibiscus lends the Tea its tartness and beautiful red hue, dried apples and licorice root sweeten the blend a bit, and rose hips round out the flavor profile with mellow, floral notes. All in, you get a cheerful cup of Herbal Tea that’s layered but never overwhelming. 

Brew it hot, and the Tea’s flavors unfold slowly—citrusy at first, then deep and slightly jammy. Iced, it’s crisp and refreshing, making it an easy choice for warm afternoons or a midday reset. Since it’s naturally caffeine- free, there’s no wrong time to enjoy a cup. Whether you’re steeping it for a slow morning or just looking for an anytime alternative to the usual herbal standbys, our Citrus Berry Herbal Tea earns its spot on your shelf. Look for it in our coffee and tea section for a limited time, while supplies last.

They are missing some teeth from years ago due to a car accident and they attempted implants that did not hold in the gums so they were never able to replace the missing teeth..

Can any professionals weigh in on what can be done at this point? Is there such a thing as ""it's too late you need to let nature take it's course"" and just wait for death?

I stared at the blond woman who had just stepped out of the door behind Levi. She kept her face turned away from the camera, but there was no denying it was a beautiful female wearing a very tiny dress.

I knew he didn't love her. He loved me. She was just the one thing he couldn't quit. She was an addiction.
—
I WOKE AND JUST LIKE the day before, I stared up at the ceiling. No getting out of bed and hitting the ground running for me. I had nothing on my schedule for the day. I didn't really need to do any shopping. I would go the day Levi got back. That way everything would be fresh. That meant my day was clear.
I sighed, rolling out of bed with very little enthusiasm. I was regretting my decision to stay behind. I should have gone to Louisiana with Levi. At least then I would have something to do. Although I knew how the away games worked. I would be left alone in the hotel for almost the entire time. He would be doing press, training, playing, more press and then more press.
I thought about going over to the greenhouse and picking up the painting. I was going to hang it in the living room where it would be in full view from the couch. I couldn't quite muster the energy to do that just yet. I was going to be lazy and kick around the house for a bit.
I checked my phone and found a message from Levi. He had sent it around three this morning. I couldn't help but smile as I read the message aloud. ""We won, of course. I scored two touchdowns, which I'm sure you saw. I love you and miss you.""
He must have been out celebrating with the guys, judging by the time of the message. I probably shouldn't do it, but I called him anyway. His phone would likely go straight to voicemail, which was fine. I just wanted to leave him a quick message letting him know I loved him and was thinking about him.
When voicemail picked up, I was a little disappointed I wouldn't get to hear his voice. ""Hey, baby, I love you. I got your message. I'm so proud of you. I'll call you later. Rest and enjoy a little relaxation today.""
I put the phone down and started a second cup of coffee. I wasn't interested in making a big breakfast and opted for a bowl of cold cereal. It was so much easier than the eggs and smoothies I usually made every morning. My phone rang and I almost jumped on it with the hopes it was Levi returning my call.
""Hello,"" I answered in a sultry voice.
""I'm not him,"" Alexus said.
I pulled my phone away and looked at the screen to verify what I already knew. ""Hey you! What are you doing up so early?""
""I couldn't sleep.""
""Did you go out last night?""
""For a bit. We were all kinds of tired and turned in early.""
I had a feeling she was trying to make me feel better. ""Don't lie. You better be having fun.""
She giggled. ""We are definitely having fun but it would be so much better if you were here. I'm so bummed that you are not.""
""What are you guys going to do today?"" I asked, staring down at my cereal.
""I think we are going to do a little shopping and then hang out at the pool.""
""Do you have tickets for a show tonight?"" I questioned.
""Not tonight. Tonight we are going to hit some of the clubs.""
Again, a feeling of jealousy tore through me. ""Are you going to wear that new dress?""
""I am,"" she said with a laugh. ""How are you doing?""
""I'm good,"" I assured her. ""I painted yesterday and I think I'm going to go back out today.""
""Are you sure you're doing okay?""
""I am. Thank you for asking. Now, don't worry about me. You girls go out and have fun.""
""I'll be thinking about you the whole time,"" she said.
""Thanks. Have fun.""
After her call I felt worse. It wasn't her intention, but hearing that they were having a good time just made me feel even more melancholy. I was supposed to be there. I was supposed to be sitting in a lavish hotel with my best friends and drinking mimosas by the pool. Instead, I was at home alone—as usual.
I dumped out the rest of the cereal, rinsed the bowl, and put it in the dishwasher. I turned on the TV again, hoping to find some highlights. He would quiz me when he got home. He would ask me questions about the little details of a catch and what he did when he scored a touchdown. A good girlfriend would have watched the game. I had been a distracted girlfriend. I wouldn't let it happen again.
I saw his coach and knew I was on the right track. I flopped down on the couch and waited. Soon enough, Levi's face came on the screen before it cut to an obviously surprise interview at his hotel. He hated when they did that. I shook my head, angry on his behalf.
The reporter stuck a microphone in his face. A camera zoomed up on him, giving viewers a very up-close and personal look at those baby blues that had not only captured my heart, but the hearts of the nation. The camera zoomed out a little, a door directly behind him. The reporter started to ask him a question but I didn't hear it. I couldn't hear anything except for a loud buzzing sound in my ears.
I stared at the blond woman who had just stepped out of the door behind Levi. She kept her face turned away from the camera, but there was no denying it was a beautiful female wearing a very tiny dress. It was the proverbial walk of shame, right out of my boyfriend's hotel room. I stared at the number on the door behind him. There was no denying what I saw. It was his hotel room.
He couldn't tell me it was the camera angle that caught the room next door. He couldn't claim it was his publicist or anyone else. Even without all of that, it wouldn't matter. I knew who the girl was. She was like a bad rash. Every time I thought she was out of our lives, she popped back up. I couldn't understand why she wouldn't just leave us alone. I knew he didn't love her. He loved me. She was just the one thing he couldn't quit. She was an addiction.
I sat forward and rubbed my face. Levi's voice filled the room, overwhelming my thoughts. I didn't want to think about him or her or them together. I reached for the remote and turned off the television. I couldn't hear his voice another second. I didn't want to risk seeing her walk back into his room.
""Why, Levi? Why?""
I jumped to my feet, suddenly feeling extremely sick. I raced down the hall to the guest bathroom and threw up the little breakfast I had eaten. Once I was sure the nausea had passed, I got to my feet and splashed cold water on my face.
I stared at my reflection in the mirror. I looked into my own hazel eyes. I had zero makeup on. The freckles that were scattered over my nose and cheekbones were evident. Levi always told me he loved my freckles. Was he lying? I had been through this before. I felt the sting of betrayal and immediately questioned my own looks. I felt insecure and had gone through a whole phase of trying to lose weight and be prettier for him.
Then there was the next time and I realized it wasn't anything I'd done. It was him. He told me it was him. He convinced me I was beautiful and everything he wanted. He promised it would never happen again. He claimed he was weak and couldn't resist the temptation. The woman had flattered him. She'd told him everything he wanted to hear. She had pecked him. She had plied him with alcohol until he couldn't resist her.
That had been the story then and I'd bought it. I forgave him. He made a million promises and I believed him. It was the fame. It had been a confusing time. The instant celebrity had been overwhelming for him. I accepted his excuses and we vowed to move forward. We promised each other we would never let anyone come between us.
""Prick!"" I shouted and slapped my hand against the mirror. The thing shattered, cutting my hand. I felt no pain. I felt nothing. I was so pissed and hurt on a level that physical pain couldn't come close to touching.
I walked out of the bathroom and headed for our bedroom. I was so pissed. I wanted to smash everything. I wanted to break windows and slash tires. I was tired of feeling hurt. I couldn't be hurt anymore. I felt nothing but white-hot anger. He forbade me from going to Vegas out of fear of hurting his reputation and yet he was sneaking women into his hotel room. He was worried about me and he was the one who couldn't keep his shaft in his pants.
I couldn't think straight. Memories of the times he had been caught cheating before overwhelmed me. Memories of the promises he made and the tears he had shed begging me to give him another chance. I was a fool. I didn't know what to do with myself. All I knew was I didn't want to be sitting at home all by myself while he screwed that woman. No wonder he didn't want me to go. How many times had he done this? Had this been going on the whole time?
I stopped moving and took a deep breath. I wasn't going to sit in the house and wait for him while he screwed her. I was going to Vegas. He couldn't stop me. I still had my ticket. I was hoping I could get a flight out right away. If I couldn't, I would charter a plane with his credit card. He gave me the card in case of emergency. In my opinion, this was an emergency.

Picture this: you're walking down the street, minding your own business, when you spot something in the corner of your eye. It's tall. It's shiny. It's humming with potential.

No, it’s not a robot uprising (yet).  
It’s a **Bitcoin BTM**—your friendly neighborhood Bitcoin ATM.

In a world moving faster than a lightning transaction on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin BTMs are changing the game. But guess what makes your BTM experience even smoother, smarter, and way cooler?  
**A free Bitcoin QR code from** [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

Yep, we're talking about the ultimate tag-team for crypto adventurers everywhere: **Bitcoin BTMs + QR codes**.

Let’s dive into why this dynamic duo is revolutionizing the way we handle Bitcoin in everyday life—and how you can jump on the fast track to crypto freedom without breaking a sweat.

# First Things First: What Exactly Is a Bitcoin BTM?

Think of a **Bitcoin BTM** (Bitcoin Teller Machine) as a bridge between the digital world of Bitcoin and the tangible world we live in. Instead of dealing with online exchanges that require endless verification photos where you look like a sleep-deprived goblin, you can just stroll up to a Bitcoin BTM and:

* **Buy Bitcoin** with cash or card
* **Sell Bitcoin** and withdraw cash
* **Check prices** faster than your buddy can say “HODL”

They’re popping up everywhere—malls, convenience stores, gas stations, airports. Pretty soon, you might spot one next to your favorite taco truck.

# But Here’s the Plot Twist: You Need a Bitcoin Address

If you’re buying Bitcoin at a BTM, the machine has a simple question for you:  
**“Where should I send the Bitcoin?”**

Cue the sweat.

Unless you already have a **Bitcoin wallet** ready to rock (with a **valid address** on standby), you're going to be stuck standing at the machine like a deer in headlights.

**This is where your FREE secret weapon comes in:**  
👉 [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)

Using our free Bitcoin QR code maker dApp, you can **instantly generate a Bitcoin address in QR code form**, ready to scan at the BTM. No typing. No copy-pasting. No frantic ""Hold on, I swear I have an app somewhere..."" moments.

# Why You Absolutely Need a Bitcoin QR Code at a BTM

Let’s be real: Bitcoin addresses are the world's worst thing to type manually.

* 30+ random characters
* Uppercase, lowercase, sometimes numbers
* A single wrong letter? Your coins could end up in a black hole of regret

**Trapdoor avoided**:  
When you use a QR code, the BTM simply scans your code, instantly knows where to send your Bitcoin, and—bam—you’re a proud Bitcoin owner without risking a typo apocalypse.

**Bonus**: QR codes make you look super prepared and tech-savvy. You might even get nods of approval from other crypto enthusiasts in line (which is basically modern-day street cred).

# How [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) Saves the Day

Our free dApp is basically your backstage pass to smoother Bitcoin BTM experiences.

Here's what it does:

# ✅ Generate Bitcoin QR Codes Instantly

Just input your Bitcoin address (or have your wallet app create one for you), and in seconds, you have a clean, scannable QR code.

# ✅ Optional: Add Specific Amounts

Want to tell the BTM to send exactly 0.01 BTC? You can add that info right into your QR code if you want. No math under pressure!

# ✅ Easy Downloads

Save your QR code to your phone, email it to yourself, or even print it out. Your choice.

# ✅ No Sign-Up, No Catch

We believe QR codes should be fast and free—just like Bitcoin dreams should be.

# Real-World Scenarios Where You’ll Thank Yourself for Having a QR Code

**1. The Speedy BTM Line**  
People are waiting. You could fumble with your app... or you could flash your QR code like a crypto pro. **Scan. Confirm. Done.** Flex level: 9000.

**2. Helping Newbies Get Started**  
Your buddy wants to buy their first Bitcoin. Instead of giving them a 40-minute tutorial on wallets, you help them generate a QR code and point them to the nearest BTM. You are now a **crypto hero**.

**3. Emergency BTC Purchases**  
Need Bitcoin fast to catch a market dip? BTMs + your ready-to-scan QR code = no missed opportunity.

**4. Accepting Bitcoin Payments IRL**  
Own a small business or side hustle? Laminate your QR code and stick it by your cash register. Customers can pay you in Bitcoin straight from a BTM nearby. Welcome to the future.

# Pro Tip: Combine Your QR Code with a Lightning Wallet

Many Bitcoin BTMs are starting to support **Lightning payments**, which means even faster transactions with lower fees.  
Generate a QR code for your **Lightning wallet address** (when supported), and watch payments zip through faster than a caffeinated squirrel.

(And yes, [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) is perfect for Lightning QR codes too!)

# A Quick Step-by-Step to Conquer Any Bitcoin BTM Like a Legend

1. **Get your Bitcoin wallet ready.**
2. **Generate a QR code** for your receiving address at [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).
3. **Save or print** the QR code.
4. **Walk up to the BTM**, and select ""Buy Bitcoin.""
5. **Scan your QR code** when the machine asks for your address.
6. **Insert your cash or card.**
7. **Confirm the transaction.**
8. **Celebrate responsibly** (maybe with tacos).

Easy, fast, no typos, no drama.

# Final Thoughts: Bitcoin BTMs + Free QR Codes = Pure Magic

The world is shifting, and crypto is taking over one coffee shop and one BTM at a time.  
But **being prepared** is what separates the smooth operators from the flustered noobs fumbling with their phones at the machine.

**Bitcoin BTMs** bring the power of Bitcoin to the streets.

- **LogGPT: Complete Chatlog JSON Downloader**

I have two open source apps now available for use with CharGPT.  The first is a chat-log download extension for Safari called LogGPT available in the App Store, and is also available on my GitHub for those who want to build it themselves. Purchasing on the App Store ($1.99) is probably the best option as you will automatically get updates as I fix any issues whcih come upm though buying me a coffee is always welcome.

I find it useful for moving a ChatGPT session from one context to another for continuity and not having to explain to the new instance everything we were working on. It's also useful for archiving chat history, and I have created several tools, also open source to help with extracting the downloaded JSON into HTML and Markdown, along with a chunking tool which breaks the file down into small enough chunks for uploading into a new CharGPT context as well as having overlap in the files for continuity of context. Rather than take up to much space, you may read about it on my website in my blog post, theer's more information there.

[LogGPT Conversation Wxport With Full Privacy](https://unixwzrd.ai/projects/loggpt/2025/04/16/loggpt-introduction/)
Links to my other tools are listed in the post.

There will be an App Store update soon as I need to move the ""Download"" button over a bit as it covers the ""Canvas"" selector partially. I will have that as soon as it gets through App review, though it's still very usable.

For uploading context into a new session, I use this prompt, which seems effective:

```
# Context Move Instructions

Our conversation exceeded the length restrictions. I am uploading our previous conversation so we can continue with the same context. Please **review and internally reconstruct the discussion** but **do not summarize back to me** unless requested.

The files are in markdown format, numbered sequentially and contain overlapping content (XX Bytes) to ensure continuity. Pay special attention to the **last file**, as it contains our most recent exchanges. If any chunks are missing or unclear, let me know.

There are XX total conversation files in Markdown format. Since I can only upload **10 files at a time**, I will inform you when all batches are uploaded. Please reply with **""Received. Ready for next batch.""** after you have had a chance to review and summarize the batch internally until I confirm all uploads are complete.

Once all files are uploaded, I will provide your initial instructions, and we will resume working together. At that time, we will discuss your **memory of our previous conversation** to ensure alignment before moving forward.
```

- **Unicode/UTF-8 Removal and Replacement For AI Generated Text**

Also I have a tool for removing and replacing Unicode/UTF-8 characters which seem to be embedded in text generated by ChatGPT, along with a few other artifacts. Not sure why this is happening, but it may be an attempt to watermark the text in order to identify it as AI generated. It's more than hidden spaces and extends to a wide range of characters. It's also Open Source.  It works as a filter in vi/Vim and VSCode Vim mode by simply using:

```
:%!cleanup-text
```

It also removes other artifacts such as trailing spaces on lines, which are also bothersome.

You can read about it here with links to my GitHub - [UnicodeFix: The Day Invisible Characters Broke Everything](https://unixwzrd.ai/projects/unicodefix/2025/04/25/unicodefix-introduction/)

(Get new donor bonus money) Use the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! I will educate you about plasma. Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

I cannot stress enough that I am not at all a heavy drinker and haven’t been out to the bars in years. My friends wanted to take me out bar hopping for my birthday and I invited my new bf who I have only very recently started dating. 

We were having a lot of fun, a lot of people were buying me drinks, every thing was fine at first. I really thought I knew my limits, but apparently I did not. At the last bar, I ended up blacking out. 

Apparently, I had fallen over and bf decided it was time to get me home. The uber ended up dropping us off early some ways from my house because I was puking everywhere. I’m not entirely sure how, but he managed to get me home and up my stairs. I woke up in my hallway in the recovery position, completely a mess. He ended up washing my sweater and his shirt in my bath tub and staying the night to watch over me.

We talked about it briefly in the morning and he played it off well and made me feel validated for getting plastered and enjoying my birthday. We had previously made plans for a birthday brunch and a drive together, but when I asked him about it he said he might have to work and kinda blew me off. I again apologized profusely and thanked him for taking care of me, then he left. 

Later on, when I was in a clearer state of mind I was able to reflect more and realized just how badly I fucked up. We talked over text, and he finally admitted that he was not thrilled with how the night ended, but wasn’t mad or holding anything against me. He still said he had fun. I asked if he had time to meet for coffee and he agreed to a “meet up”, but I’ve just got this horrible feeling that it’ll be the end. 

He is such a sweet guy and honestly the first guy I’ve met in a while that I could honestly see myself with for a long time. When we met, we clicked instantly and have been pretty inseparable, but now the vibes feel off. I don’t want this mistake to get in the way of what could be a great relationship, but I also understand that I can’t change the way he feels. I’ve never wished for an undo button harder.

I bought him an apology/thank you card, some chocolate, money for the uber, and plan to buy his coffee when we meet up tomorrow. Is there anything else I should do? Anyone have experience with this?

TLDR: Puked on new bf, apologized, but feel I could do more. What can I do to make things right?

I’m a pretty open minded person, on the spectrum, and if someone lets me know about a major aspect of their life (whatever the circumstance), I tend to sympathize.

So I’m wondering two things:

1) in your personal experience, at what point did you let your friends or gf/bfs know about probation. 

Obviously I understand people keeping this on the down low at work and around acquaintances. But what about close friends?

2) what situation would result in someone with an ankle monitor in the state of California and a probation officer? My friend won’t tell me anything else. 

I had no idea he was in jail or prison or some legal predicament. I confided all this information in him and he just never mentioned anything. I want to be understanding, but I feel like I don’t know this guy now. 

The only reason he told me is because he only hangs out in like a half-mile radius (thought he was just eccentric), and one day I was about to order us an uber to go “only” two miles to a late night coffee shop where we could chat after drinking. 

And he freaked out and said he’s “not allowed.” And I jokingly said, “who’s not allowing you to travel around the city? What are you on house arrest?” (Obviously having no idea that he was in fact being gpa-tracked). He showed me his ankle monitor and talked about his parole officer. I was shocked.

We're all Not-Republicans who are anywhere from mildly liberal to classical conservatives (i.e. flaming blue-hair liberals by MAGA standards), and given the US political situation we had plenty to talk about... and to feel shitty about. Especially since some of us are being directly affected by the anti-left mobocracy. 

Somehow we got on the subject of creationism and the young earth, probably because one of my friends is in a bishopric and is friends with a couple of prominent Utah politicians who are very cozy with the MAGA movement, and he shared with us a story of how these people were talking about these subjects in a recent sacrament meeting. (No names, since that could dox them.) 

Make no mistake... my friends are all firm believers in the church's basic truth claims. But it was mildly entertaining, at least for a few moments, to hear these people take swipes at the irrational anti-science, anti-evidence schools of thought that exist within MAGA...

But then I felt deeply frustrated. These are bright, fun, and good people who value reasoning and evidence... right up until the point that it conflicts with what the church teaches. 

They have no problem mocking others who believe in a 6000-year-old earth, but also accept it as indisputable fact that Joseph Smith was telling the truth about seeing two all powerful deities in the woods near his families home in the Finger Lakes, and that these same deities care about whether young people pleasure themselves, and that drinking coffee makes them unworthy to be in the presence of God in ornate, gaudy buildings. 

All of them are me... four years ago. 

To be reminded of how much I had compartmentalized, and how much cognitive dissonance I was living with all the time without realizing it... it made me feel so tired. And sad. Especially since I'm married to one of them.

Sometimes, being an ex-Mo in Utah, especially in a mixed-faith marriage, feels like being a thirsty person in the ocean. So close, yet so far away. And still feeling alone, knowing that even my good friends and the woman I sleep next to every night have no real clue about what I've been through, and why. 

Just had to vent.

1ka9rym,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ka9rym/i_got_dumped_via_email_and_im_still_not_over_it/,I got dumped via email and I'm still not over it.," I’ve never posted here in my life, so forgive me if I’m doing things weirdly or wrong. I just need to vent, journaling hasn’t done enough, and I guess I’m too proud to be this vulnerable with people who know me directly. I’m usually so measured and cynical, but this whole situation has left me feeling like a colossal moron and now I don’t know what to do. I’m gonna use fake names and get into it, so buckle up.

I (f30) have never been in love. I was bullied pretty viciously as a kid. It tanked my self-esteem, so it was easy to find myself in relationships with abusive partners because I didn’t yet understand how to navigate my own boundaries. Once I did, I met a great guy that I’ll call Joe (m31) who I spent five years dating. He was everything a partner should be: calm, kind, caring, willing to talk through any problem. But he was the priority. All of my time was spent in the spaces where our interests overlapped. He brushed past the parts of me that didn’t interest him or pouted when I spent too much time away from him by pursuing my other interests. I talk a ton, but we spent so much time in silence. He never had answers to my questions/musings about the world as a whole, so I eventually stopped asking. Without realizing it, I’d given up chunks of myself to better suit him and his needs. Leaving was the hardest but most liberating thing I’ve had to do in a relationship so far.

After years of therapy and learning from experience, I finally know what I want and need in a partner. The effort was there with Joe, but we were fundamentally incompatible. I need someone to love me for me. So I hopped on the dating apps and was completely, unabashedly myself. I’m not afraid of rejection anymore. If you don’t like me, let’s find out ASAP so we don’t end up in an unhappy 5 year relationship, right? After a few bumps in the road, I met Zach (m31) this past November.

As I said, I’m a cynic. I generally don’t believe in things I can’t see. I roll my eyes whenever people say “I knew as soon as I laid eyes on them that they were the one.” I get frustrated by people getting married after not dating very long. It all seems like complete nonsense. But the moment his profile popped up, I felt a weird tug in my chest. I’m definitely attracted to him, but it’s not like he’s strikingly hot or anything. His profile wasn’t especially interesting. I only say this to emphasize how weird it was for me to feel that way. In any case, I felt that teeny tug and swiped right.

Have you ever descended down a flight of stairs in the dark and accidentally skipped a step? Your foot plunges into nothingness for a moment before hitting the next step, sending a surge of adrenaline from your heel to your throat? You know? Yeah? No? Just me? Anyway, talking to him felt kinda like that. We started with a silly little conversation about having siblings that immediately spiraled into the complexities of family dynamics and the human experience as a whole. He asked me out on a date after a few days of chatting and I immediately agreed.

It was fantastic. And the next date a few days later. And the next. We saw each other every few days or so for almost a month. I could get into the details of all the exceptional dates, but suffice it to say that our shortest one was probably three hours long and we spent the entire time talking and laughing. Neither of us was afraid to talk about anything from the silliest to the most difficult topics. We have similar values and goals. He’s confident without being condescending and he has this unorthodox way of approaching the world that’s endlessly endearing. We both want to use our jobs to improve elements of the world around us. I’m embarrassed to admit it because our time together was so short, but it felt like I finally found my person. I figured out my issues and now everything was clicking into place.

While we both seemed to be enthusiastically enjoying one another’s company, we also never got super physical. My past issues made this a refreshing change of pace for me. That said, I didn’t understand why he was so reserved with me in that regard. He came over to my house and while we were hanging out watching movies, he was aaaaaallll the way on the other side of the couch. He’d mentioned people being in his space too much at work before so I figured he just likes to maintain his bubble, but when I asked about it, he said I had “blanket permission to be in his space.” The closed-off body language persisted though.

There were also a couple of spells where he’d disappear for a bit. A few hours would go by with tentative plans hanging in the air, and those plans would sometimes get canceled or just kinda left hanging, unconfirmed. Then we had pretty solid plans one day and he just never followed through on them. He showed up to my job the following day (which was a solid 40 mins from him) with my favorite coffee and apologized about it, later telling me that he’s having some difficulties at home and he occasionally gets overwhelmed with it all and withdraws. I understand that completely. It did get better for a while but it eventually got inconsistent again. We obviously needed to figure out what was really up. He said he was struggling to pin down how he was feeling and asked if he could shoot me an email in a little while after he thought about it more. I agreed. I like getting written information because I have a pretty terrible memory and I like being able to reference things later. I told him that and he said he would do it, but later asked if we could just meet up because he felt safe saying things to me directly. Okay, we met up.

He said he may not be ready for a relationship and I may be a case of “right person, wrong time.” I said that was okay, and we could either try to work out what was going on or we could stop pursuing this now. I said I can’t say I’ll wait for him, but I’d be open to reconnecting someday in the future if the timing were right for both of us. He asked if it would be okay for us to be friends. I told him that I felt strongly enough about him at this point that seeing him with someone else down the line would be too awful. He said “I wouldn’t- being with someone else wouldn’t be the point” and I’m honestly not sure what he meant. Like he wasn’t ready for a relationship so he wouldn’t date someone else? I’m sure that’d be true in the short-term, but would that be true forever? Would he seek me out romantically when he was ready or would he look for someone else after seeing me as a friend for so long? And would I be capable of moving on from him if he were still in my life? That’s entirely too many unknowns. So I told him that I’d like to be with him and I’m willing to stick around or we can part ways, but he has to make the call because I don’t know what’s best for him. He said he wanted to try to be together.

We went exclusive, I met some of his friends, and everything seemed to be going great. Then he disappeared for almost a full week. Up until that point, we never missed a day of texting each other. It wasn’t deliberate (we’re all busy adults so it’s no biggie to text infrequently) but we fell into a rhythm of texting at least something every day and suddenly he was just gone. I was convinced he ghosted me. I don’t tend to do well with not knowing what’s up. I’d rather someone tell me outright that they hate my guts than to just disappear and leave me wondering, you know? That’s part of the reason I try so hard to be a safe person to come to with difficult topics. I don’t blow up or freak out about things, so please just tell me so I can go on with my life. I’d be really sad for him to decide he didn’t like me after I felt so strongly about him, but I would completely respect the decision and back off all the same.

Zach didn’t ghost me completely. He sent me an email describing his mental health and detailing all of the reasons he thinks I’m incredible. It was nothing superficial; he described the things about me that are central to who I am. He talked about things I didn’t even know he saw in me. He also talked about how his mental health has taken a turn that has made it really hard to feel anything at all. His last relationship had some serious issues and I figure that being in a relationship with me brought on some unexpected feelings and touched on trauma he didn’t know was there. He also mentioned that I’m the kind of person he’s always dreamed of being with, but he never imagined he’d be in such a bad spot when he met that person. He carried on to say that he has to figure this out and that it would be irresponsible to do it while also starting this new relationship, particularly because he knows his behavior has hurt me already. He ended it with a sweet haiku.

SO. I got broken up with via email. I responded to it and broke down how I’m feeling, suggested (maybe too heavily) that he seek therapy to make this journey easier, and included a painting that I made based on the haiku he sent. He told me that he loved the painting and would spend some time on a response over the weekend. This was almost four months ago and he hasn’t reached out since. I eventually caved and told him that I’m here if he needs me but he didn’t respond.

We talked effortlessly and endlessly. He described our conversations as “sprawling and fulfilling,” but I did only know him for two months. I never went to his house. Maybe he’s secretly married? Maybe he thinks I’m too sweet and feels guilty hurting my feelings, so he tried to soften the blow with that email? But how many words does it take to soften a blow? Excluding this last paragraph, his email was as long as this entire post. Would you go on and on that much to placate someone? Could you come up with that many sincere observations about someone’s best characteristics? He struggled to follow through, he didn’t communicate in the way I needed, and he told me outright that his heart wasn’t in it because it hasn’t been in anything lately. And I’m embarrassed to admit that I still can’t even think about dating someone else. I would need him to step up, but I wouldn’t hesitate to give him that chance. I’m worried about how he’s doing. I think of him when I’m spending time outside in my favorite places, recalling how much we were looking forward to warmer weather and outdoor adventures together. I’ve never felt like that about anyone in a romantic context. I was so scared to show Joe things that were meaningful to me that I didn’t even listen to music while we dated. I spent years telling myself that it wasn’t about him, it was me being reactive to the trauma of my abusive partners in the past. But Zach was immediately different. I wasn’t afraid of him seeing me. I wanted him to. I wanted to play him my favorite songs and invite him into my imperfect apartment. I wanted to be flawed and weird and silly and scared and strong and every other shape I happen to take. I thought the only possible outcomes were acceptance and rejection and I was comfortable with either one. He went beyond both. He didn’t just accept me, he encouraged and celebrated me. But I wasn’t prepared for how much more it would hurt to be told I’m someone he “could have” loved.",1,1745882829.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

My parents (who live on the other side of the country) are paying for my education, and I’m currently jobless. I don’t have a car and live in a very pedestrian unfriendly environment (and I have various illnesses that prevent me from much physical activity) so walking to a job isn’t really an option. 

I can’t afford a car because my parents already don’t have much money, most of it goes into their and my living expenses and my college, and I need to get a job to afford a car. I’m at a catch 22. I used to live at a place with bus access but was outpriced by rent increases and so we had to move. I moved with my roommates to a new place with less accessibility under the condition that I would have access to school and grocery shopping and such because all 4 of my roommates have a car and they would take turns driving me places if I needed something. I was optimistic about it, but now I just want to disappear. One roommate is never home, one has just decided she doesn’t want to drive me anywhere, and the two who I am closest to have very busy schedules so I can’t bother them too often.

My biggest struggle is getting from school back to home, because it’s a lot to ask my roommates to find the time to drive out to pick me up and take me all the way back home. It’s simpler if we just carpool but our schedules don’t line up a lot of the time. I can’t afford to uber places regularly. I have friends at school who can drive and have taken me back a few times, although I basically bribed them with money for coffee and stuff. It’s less expensive than uber, but god am I sick of kissing ass just to get from point a to b. 

Lately, my friends with cars have just been booking it out the door before I can even ask for a ride rather than just telling me they don’t want to drive me. I’d rather they just make up an excuse at this point tbh. I know I’m annoying. I know I’m an adult with no autonomy. I know it’s embarrassing and fucking sad. I feel like a burden. I don’t know what to do aside from stay home and starve most of the time rather than ask to go grocery shopping and have to listen to them complain about having to take me along. It’s really taking a toll on my mental health and I kind of just feel like taking the weight off everyone’s shoulders and offing myself. 

I really hoped I would be able to leave those thoughts in high school, but I guess some things never go away. I’m staying here under the vague hope that after I graduate I can get some kind of job and move away to live alone. I share a room with two people and I can’t just traumatize them and leave them to clean up my shit. I can’t throw my parents hard earned money away after they spent it all on me. I don’t know what the fuck to do or who to talk to. All I do is waste everybody’s time and money. Fml",2,1745882547.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

Episode 4:“The Journey of Joy“

As Sarah's journey of joy unfolds, it becomes a testament to the transformative power of friendship, resilience, and hope. From the moment she met Emily, a kindred spirit filled with laughter and empathy, Sarah knew that their bond would transcend the ordinary and lead them on an extraordinary path together. Their journey began with a chance encounter at a local café where Emily's infectious smile and genuine kindness lit up Sarah's world, sparking a friendship that would change both of their lives forever.

With each passing day, Sarah and Emily's connection grew stronger, weaving a tapestry of shared experiences, hopes, dreams, and fears. Sarah found solace in Emily's unwavering support, especially during times of uncertainty and doubt. Emily, in turn, drew inspiration from Sarah's courage and resilience in the face of adversity. Together, they embarked on a journey of self-discovery and growth, navigating through life's twists and turns with grace and determination.

Their journey was not without challenges. Along the way, they encountered setbacks, heartaches, and obstacles that tested their friendship and resolve. But through it all, they remained steadfast in their belief that joy was not just a fleeting emotion but a state of being that could be cultivated and nurtured through moments of connection, laughter, and shared experiences.

As they journeyed through life's ups and downs, Sarah and Emily discovered the true meaning of joy - not as a destination to be reached, but as a continuous journey of self-discovery and gratitude. They learned to find joy in the simple moments - a shared cup of coffee on a rainy day, a heart-to-heart conversation under a blanket of stars, a spontaneous adventure to uncharted territories.

Through their bond, Sarah and Emily found the strength to confront their fears, confront their past traumas, and embrace the possibilities that lay ahead. They encouraged each other to step out of their comfort zones, chase their dreams, and live life to the fullest. In each other's company, they found a safe haven where vulnerability was embraced, tears were shed, and laughter echoed through the corridors of their souls.

As Sarah's journey of joy reached its climax, she realized that joy was not an elusive concept but a choice that she could make every day. She discovered that true joy resided not in the absence of pain or suffering but in the ability to find beauty and meaning in the midst of chaos and despair. Through the support of her friend Emily, she learned to embrace her flaws, celebrate her victories, and accept herself unconditionally.

In the end, Sarah's journey of joy was not defined by grand achievements or external accolades but by the quiet moments of contentment and gratitude that she shared with Emily. Their friendship had become a source of strength, a beacon of light in the darkness, a reminder that joy was not a distant memory but a present reality waiting to be embraced.

As they stood on the threshold of a new beginning, Sarah and Emily knew that their journey of joy was far from over. They understood that life would continue to throw curveballs, challenges, and surprises their way. But armed with the knowledge that they were not alone, that they had each other's backs, they were ready to face whatever came their way with unwavering courage and boundless joy.

And so, as the sun set on Sarah's journey of joy, a sense of peace descended upon her heart. She knew that no matter what the future held, she had a friend by her side who would cheer her on, wipe her tears, and remind her that joy was not just a fleeting emotion but a lifelong companion. And in that moment of clarity and connection, Sarah understood that the true essence of joy lay not in the destination but in the journey itself - a journey she was grateful to share with her dearest friend, Emily.",1,1745882251.0,u_desertgodfather,0,1.0,False

1.The Stew Crew lives in a bubble where only magical things occur and this week they floated to Hawaii for 2 straight weeks of content gathering. Hawaii is no surprise as a destination because we know that Trace, Zach, Gil, KJ and the littles have already been in the past year… and her best frenemy Josie announced a big Hawaii trip coming in May.  That was all Carlin needed to hear to book the tickets.  The next time they make hats with catchphrases I better see one that says “ME TOO ME TOO”. Anyway, our first glimpse is the Stewarts getting off of the plane and hitting the beach and Layla is anything but happy.  Carlin holds her and tosses her around to try and illicit a smile, but the little diva ain’t having it. This reel has a ton of negative comments… more than Carlin usually gets.  Folks say things about the amount of money they spend (someone says they spend money like “a drunken sailor”), how they never actually show up and work at their small business, and the blatant exploitation of their kids. Carlin doesn’t have to respond bc there are hundreds of fans willing to take up for them.  We learn that Evan’s entire family is coming to join this trip to celebrate his parent’s 50th wedding anniversary.  They came a week early so they can exploit without any nagging from his family.  Carlin is linking everything like crazy from panty liners to the car seats to the luggage including a large camera bag.  In the midst of all of the linked hygiene products there sits a lone wooden spoon.  Why would she need a wooden spoon in a carry-on bag?  Evan is hyper aware of what folks are saying so we quickly see Layla and Zade on the beach playing in the sand WITH the spoon.  No Beach toys… just a bowl from the hotel and this lone spoon.  I mean that totally clears it up. Carlin packed this spoon so her kids could play with it on the beach… one at a time.  Carlin links every toy and item she packed for her kids to have on the flight and Evan films Carlin helping Layla read bc home school can happen anywhere.  In Carlin’s IG grid post we see the family posing on the beach, the most basic food and Layla either playing up for the camera or sulking.  The weekly vlog takes us back to Easter and Evan is front and center with his Potato Head filling the entire screen.  They show the kids picking up the eggs they threw all over the AstroTurf and Carlin gushing about how much she loves being a mom.  Isn’t that a given?  I mean she’s pregnant with #3 at 27.  Is this unique information?  Evan puts money in ONE egg that Zade spots, but Layla grabs.  Zade looks on sadly as Layla rejoices in her win until Evan finally suggests they could buy something together.  As much as they love being parents, one might think they could set it up so BOTH kids win.  We see the usual filming in church, and Layla is being carried around by Carlin before singing in the kid’s choir. After lunch at the big house, they are off to the airport and Carlin tells us Kelly Jo planned their trip and itinerary. As quickly as possible they get Layla in a bathing suit so they can film her as she twists, twirls and throws faces for the camera.  Evan goes out to buy groceries on his own and that means he sets the camera up all over the place and films himself. Riveting.  The whole bunch head out on a boat ride for snorkeling and the subtitles are back for poor Zade.  Two weeks in Hawaii is 2 weeks he isn’t in speech therapy.  Carlin posts in full makeup, jewelry and hair done while wearing pajamas to fake cry about feeling her baby kick for the first time.  The staged excitement when she says this is the best day of her life is way over the top.  Reminder-3rd pregnancy.  Anyway, she calls the baby “he” again and acknowledges in the comments that “everyone” is telling her it is a boy.  She links every item of clothing she wears and it’s mostly H&M… just like Josie.  She hasn’t linked one BSB item so far.



2.The miniature swing set in Katie’s backyard took quite a beating this week when Hailey, Travis and the big dog, Remi all played on it at the same time.  Katie filmed and called Travis the “best dad” for this one tiny thing… Then she promotes it and links it and we know why he was out there to begin with.  It’s still $1000 too much.  Katie is back in the car to sell that money saving app again.  She tells the same story every time she sells it and I just don’t think canceling a subscription to Uber Eats is the reason these folks are living the lifestyle they have. Anyway, we also see Gil harassing Hailey in the backseat with a bear as they load up to leave the big house. Katie posts clips from the Tennessee baseball game where Lawson attempted to sing the National Anthem and she seems to be genuinely proud of him. Her ears are just broken at this point. The vlog this week shows the Clarks at the big house where Travis is helping on this mystery remodel project Zach told us about last week.  They only say it’s a small house and needs an open floor plan so it remains unclear if it’s a separate structure on the property or if they are finally refurbishing the dilapidated back of the house. In any case, what happens next truly scared my eyes.  Travis and Lawson wind up in a pull up contest started by Zach who does one pull up on a beam directly in front of Travis’ camera.  Mercy it was a… lot.  Before anyone could blink, Lawson has ripped his shirt off and hauled himself up on this beam where he does 15 pull ups and his tight jeans hang on for dear life. Travis refuses to take his shirt off and then whines that the beam hurts his hands...but old daddy Gil insists on having a turn himself.  He rips off 16 pull ups while we hear every bone in his body crack in stereo.  Lawson has to accept defeat but the real losers are all of us who witnessed that.  Travis is tasked with following Lawson around at the baseball game and filming him and it feels like a real “BIG ME, little you” move from Law.  They probably threatened Travis not to so much as HUM less they give Lawson the boot and ask Travis to take his spot.  The Clarks are at the big house for Easter and Katie says they are lumping this in with Mother’s Day bc Kelly won’t be home then.  Back at the McMansion Warden stops in to build a toy shelf and then Katie shows the walls and doors that Hailey has scribbled all over.  Like every single wall and every door pretty much.  They act surprised but when you are busy filming, editing and posting… what do you think your toddler is doing?  Katie tells us all about an upcoming girl’s trip while she cleans a stain off of her brand new white couch.  Turns out that girl’s trip was just 36 hours in NJ with Hailey for her sister in law’s baby shower.  Katie seems a bit frantic traveling alone with just Hailey, but Hailey is a breeze.  GiGi meets them at the airport where Hailey says “I missed you”.  She’s barely 2 and has her pronouns down pat.





3.Josie Balka has to keep up the pilates content all by herself while Carlin is busy doing the hula so she coerces Katie to tag along.  We see Willow and Hazel once again in their standard uniform of polyester princess dresses and Josie fully admits it is all that they wear.  Well, besides oversized beige attire.  Josie hasn’t filmed any new content for Effortless shop in quite a while and the shop is only featuring other influencers constantly taking their hair out of the pool noodle.  Is the trend dying down… finally?  Josie is back to selling makeup and it’s her new favorite.  Forget the whole spiel about how she only uses tinted moisturizer and it’s the best ever.  That was LAST month. How can anyone trust her opinion when she is totally in love with whatever company is sending her products and checks?  She would also like you to purchase her hair growth pills and she films herself flipping her hair at the camera and tapping all over the bottle with her fake nails to draw you in.  After we talked last week about not seeing Kelton in the kitchen, this week Josie shows off “Chef Kelton” at the grill at home and he cooked all of the meat for the Easter spread at the big house.  As he explains the food facing the camera his new eyebrows are arched more than McDonald’s and it appears some botox may have found its way to his temples.  Josie keeps trying with him… gotta give her that. During Easter Josie gathers her mom, Carlin, Lydia, Katie, Tiffy, Tori and Whitney to film the TikTok trend of pregnancy test roulette.  Such fun in a fertility cult.  The pee sticks are passed from one to the other with abandon and no hand sanitizer in sight.  The results reveal 2 positives we already know about… and a third not yet announced.  This sends commenters in to a frenzy of confusion because Josie filmed it, but tagged everyone and they all reposted it.  There’s so much to dissect here… these women have never seemed happier than playing this fertility game… they added their 58 year old mother who is beyond thrilled to be one of “the girls”… they filmed this specifically when their one sister who has trouble conceiving wasn’t there, but still flooded social media with it…and lastly…. Is this a thinly veiled ad for ClearBlue Easy?  This whole things should clear up the idea that these folks are totally progressive and have left their cult days behind.  Moving on… Josie drops old footage of taking Lydia to the Effortless Head Spa for her birthday.  They show their scalp consults and it was gross seeing the buildup on Josie’s hair.  You can treat yourself for upwards of $200.  Josie films a GRWM to remove a full face of makeup and sell yet another product.  This one is makeup remover and she needs a tin tub full of it.  She talks so fast and so lispy it is impossible to know what she’s really talking about.  She plays some game where you have to say what you would do if you started over in your career.  She mentions how much she loves “birth” and would want to be a doula but also adores what she does now which, according to her, is wedding makeup.  Doesn’t mention the influencing.  Before wrapping up the weekthe Balka’s are at the Farmer’s Market with their friends where she films her kids wandering around, eating doughnuts and drinking iced coffee.  Rinse and repeat.  Josie has one final surprise up her sleeve though... SHE is expecting.  Baby Miles is still trying to steady himself on 2 feet, but it’s time to grow up... Momma has a brand new embryo.  Josie is now pregnancy #5 which means Lawson was right all along and I can’t think of anything worse than Lawson Bates being right. Well, except for poor Josie’s pelvic floor.





4.It was a big, big week down at the Webster work camp. The kids got a trip to the park, their very own individual lunchable… and a small drink from the coffee shop.  They did have to wear their big clunky brown boots and agree to have their noses removed in mom’s pictures… but still.  Alyssa set her camera up so she could prance around in front of it and say she is living in her skort and tank top… and has Allie care for Rhett while she takes pictures of him making his scrunched up unhappy face.  Back at home, Alyssa tags Aldi, the phone cases and her water jug.  I hope the 58 cents commission she makes is what is buying the treats for the kids.  The Webster pool is open for the season and we see King Rhett in one of his sister’s floaties  I guess we know how tight Alyssa and John really are if they are willing to let their male child be photographed in a pink unicorn life vest…. He is also in the pool in a diaper and that’s gross and hopefully only happens at home.  In more breaking news, a friend convinced Alyssa to come over to her subdivision’s pool and let their kids play together.  Alyssa agreed bc the pool was deserted in the middle of the day and she was allowed to film all of the kids through her filter that washes away any joy or happiness.  Rhett is shown in the pink floatie and things just keeping getting worse for him bc this time he is also wearing the damn sad hat. Alyssa seems to have gotten her groove back and is no longer afraid of the world outside of her front door…. Which probably means John will want another baby soon.  The homeschool scholarship is really coming in clutch and the family (minus John) makes another trip to Sea World with the cousins.  Alyssa poses for a picture with her lover… the humongous iced coffee, and the kids line up obediently for the proof of life pictures. Bet those sea lions weren’t expecting to be filtered. Alyssa is also in her gardening era and shows tons of little vegetables and herbs she is planting around the porch at home.  Spring in Florida is so colorful and full of life and vibrancy but she works hard to strip the color away from everything.  Her filtered outlook on life matches her vibe… sepia toned and grainy with gloom pushing in from the edges.





5.Whitney Bates just wants to be relatable.  As a “busy mom of 5” she has forgotten to get her real ID.  Aw shucks, aw dang, y’all.  She’s traveling next week and has a girl’s trip coming up and needs that ID.  Hopefully she will get it on time y’all. Whitney wanted engagement with this story, and she got it.  She tells her viewers that she doesn’t own a passport bc she has no desire to ever travel outside of the good old US of A.   Zach shows off another steak dinner, this time with noodles and cheese all topped with olive oil.  His arteries are begging for mercy. He’s back out at his new griddle… this time to demonstrate how to season it correctly.  He wastes a ton of beef tallow doing this. Chad Paine is going to come running in from the shadows and grab that big vat of tallow so he and Erin can add some MLM oils to it and sell it!  Oil and grease are the themes this week as Whitney is also selling body oil.  She coats herself in it while she slips up and says she’s been spending a lot of time “out in the pool”… is that the secret they are keeping??  For some unknown reason, Zach reposts the pregnancy test reel featuring his wife, mom and all of his sisters.  Trying to drum up interest he adds the side eye emoji to the reel.  Whitney just adamantly said she was NOT pregnant in their q and a video so… guess he’s just trying to be one of the influencer girlies.  This week’s vlog is just another week of cobbled together chat with Warden.  Zach is devouring a hamburger while talking and keeps dipping it in a shared cup of sauce.  Warden looks like his stomach is turning but little Jaydon keeps wriggling around in his lap licking up the sauce while they talk.  Most of the questions are food related and every answer is just “steak” but we do learn that Gil isn’t really doing tree jobs now, and that Zach doesn’t like his dad’s work schedule.  Warden plays Fort Night with Zach’s kids and they talk about how music wasn’t allowed growing up so the boys would come to Zach’s, watch Madagascar and dance their hearts out. Warden works construction and paints lines in parking lots at night.  Zach will only say that Warden is “not married”.  Duh.  He’s 21 years old.  Let’s hope he stays single for quite a while.





6.Bless Lydia Bates heart… she is now on week 333 (33) of this never ending pregnancy that she has been preparing for the end of for 263 weeks.  This week she puts a bassinet in the corner of her room and links some maternity clothes.  She films a mini vlog of her baby checkup that is just her talking in the car, showing the inside of the doctor’s office, and then she’s back in the car and says it was too awkward to film anything.  Girl, that isn’t how Carlin Stewart made it to Hawaii for 2 weeks.  Awkward is not a word influencers know!  The baby is measuring 2 weeks behind and Lydia needs a growth scan.  She’s ready for the end, but it sounds like baby girl needs some more time.  By mid-week she totally gives up, sets up the camera pointing towards the couch, and films herself sleeping.  Finally Trace comes home and they can head to Florida.  On the 12 hour drive, Lydia regales us with fun facts like her due date of June 13 and that her favorite German meal is shoe leather steak and sad noodles.  Their vlog begins with a tour of the bedroom.  The tour is really just Lydia turning to the left, and then turning to the right but she’s super excited about ALL of the color she is adding.  ALL of the color is a blue pillow and a small blue blanket.  She shows off the baby’s clothes and a few pink outfits have snuck in. The sponsor this week is a beige rug.  Lydia’s sister is going on the vacation with them to act as Ryker’s baby sitter.  We get a house tour and it’s a super cool house that they are sharing with a friend named Hubert and his family.  Her sister gets to share a room with the other family’s babysitter for the week.  Doesn’t that sound fun and not at all miserable.





7.Spring time is when life begins anew with little babies and everything is bright and fresh and young.  Is anyone surprised then, that Erin Paine is knocked up once again?  I am pretty sure that Dr. Vick told Erin he GAVE her an extra third of an ovary, but she was groggy from the anesthesia and heard the whole thing wrong.  Then again, what else do these fools have to do?  Erin at least is trying to get you to buy her God cards and her doodled on note cards.  You can buy 5 cards for just $9.  The shipping is $4 though, so I’m finding it hard to believe this is a savvy business plan.  She wants to know if folks would like a subscription service for her tallow.  The only person I know who needs that much beef fat is brother Zach.  We see the Paine kids filing in to church on Wednesday evening and the girls all seem to have new haircuts.  Wonder if Erin does it herself, ala Michelle Duggar with a FlowBee?  Erin is super excited that the tallow is back in stock and she’s upped the prices.  There are now 2 sizes available and... drum roll please... man fat is also now available.  Men need their own masculine fat and Erin has created it.  Not sure who her test model is because we all know Chad’s hands are baby soft.  In the vlog where they announce the 7th baby, Erin is practically cooing as she rains praises on each child.  She goes overboard saying that they cried out to God and begged for a child for so long before Carles came along.  It’s all a bit much and she wraps it up by saying that she and Chad feel it is their calling in life to raise these children and point them to Jesus.  Jesus is pointing back Erin and telling you there’s more to it than just raising them.  You are supposed to educate them, feed them and give them some kind of an opportunity too.  Oh, and be able to remember their names.  That’s helpful.




8. Michael celebrates Easter by sharing tons of flower and tree pictures.  She tells the story of the Dogwood blossom and how it relates to the resurrection of Christ.  She and Brandon head to the Smoky Mountains for their church’s couples retreat and while there, they spot a bear.  She also sends huge congratulations to Erin on her announcement and gushes over the newest Balka to be. Gotta give her props for trying to roll with the flow and be a good sport.  In their new vlog they sit together at a desk and recap their Easter trip to Michigan.  They have shots of Brandon working with his dad, and his mom decorating tons of Easter goodies.They tell a story about baby bunnies that were separated from their mother and how the mom came back and rescued them. Michael says the Keilen farm is a great place to get away from it all.  I can just imagine her gathering her skirts, heading out to the middle of a cow field and screaming her lungs out.  I know I certainly would.  But instead... she just continues to keep sweet and turn the other cheek. (My dad used to tell my mom he was trying to be the bigger person and turn the other cheek but both of them were blistered!)  His mom baked, cooked and made it nice and next up they are going to tell another night-night story about their trip to Florida to visit his sister’s new baby.




9. Tiffany and Lawson spent another week stuck together at home in Nashville churning out nauseating content.  Dumb things like Tiffy complaining about her hubby trying to get her to like black coffee or how she’s the little woman who keeps them broke. She films a blank wall and shows how she added some Home Goods crap to it. Tiffany’s parents are in town again and she ruined a steak dinner for all of them not to enjoy. It’s just more shoe leather and gristle... maybe that should be their couple’s name.   She expresses how sad she gets when her parents go home.  I’m surprised they haven’t made the move to Tennessee yet.  Esther is still just about the only Bates that keeps in contact with Tiffany, and we see the 2 of them on a facetime together with baby Graham.  Baby Will is getting 2 teeth and starting to crawl.  They have a robin’s nest full of eggs in that tree Lawson loves to climb and that makes me wonder... where the heck is Duke the dog? We need to put an APB out on his whereabouts bc since he took Kelly Jo down... he hasn’t been seen.  Lawson has a new song coming out all about Poppa Bill and the title has everyone thinking the poor man is dead already.  I can’t decide if exploiting your innocent children is worse, better or the same as exploiting your elderly grandfather who is suffering from dementia... but Lawson does it all.  It’s another maudlin dirge with a 6th grade rhyming scheme where he screeches around notes while standing out in the road patting his chest and pointing in to the distance.  Tiffany promotes it heavily all week by commenting that it’s “so sad about Lawson’s granddad”.  Truly it seems they want people to be confused about his health.  She also posts a reel where she flicks Lawson in the throat because she’s furious that he is right.  It would have been so much better if she karate chopped him, but we’ll take what we can get.  We now know the trip they made to the farm was strictly so Lawson could film a music video for this mess of a song and I wish I could read Momma Jane’s thoughts when that crew pulled away.  Lawson gives a shout out to Carlin and Evan for helping them capture so many memories for them.  Does that mean they are editing?  If so... Evan is slow as hell bc they haven’t had a timely vlog in weeks. They do head to the big house for Easter and her parents join them.  Tiffany is overjoyed to be invited to join the “it girls” in their pregnancy baiting reel. She ends the week by showing us how she is teaching baby Will to smile on cue.  He needs to learn his lessons well and fast bc daddy’s new song is not going to be selling out stadiums.




10. Bits and Bytes…Kelly Jo posts a reel showing all of the families that spent Easter at the big house...BSB has a Mother’s day drop with dresses priced from $70-85.  When they don’t immediately sell out, they drop the prices on all of the brand new items by $20-35 and finally sell those $50 T-shirts for half price...Kelly Jo says Happy Birthday to Emerson who she barely knows.  She just talks about the baby on the way and how happy she is to be allowed to be a part of it all...Zach is in charge of all of the electrical work on this remodeling project.  No Evan in sight...Isaiah and Addee are fresh off of a trip to Europe with the Clown College Singing Circus and we see Addee in pictures with her rumored boyfriend...Baby Will Bates is officially 9 months old and Tiffy shares a ton of pictures but only one with any of the Bates...


Have a great week friends.  With all of these Bates babies on the way it is pretty evident that they all know the story about the stork bringing babies.  Apparently none of them know which bird prevents them from arriving in the first place...the swallow.

The meds might actually make it worse cause I feel the urge to get up and be productive. But it just doesn’t hit the same to make a coffee at home or crack open a Celsius. I want the adventure (and by adventure I mean a 10min drive that makes me feel productive😅) does anyone else experience this?

1.The Stew Crew lives in a bubble where only magical things occur and this week they floated to Hawaii for 2 straight weeks of content gathering. Hawaii is no surprise as a destination because we know that Trace, Zach, Gil, KJ and the littles have already been in the past year… and her best frenemy Josie announced a big Hawaii trip coming in May.  That was all Carlin needed to hear to book the tickets.  The next time they make hats with catchphrases I better see one that says “ME TOO ME TOO”. Anyway, our first glimpse is the Stewarts getting off of the plane and hitting the beach and Layla is anything but happy.  Carlin holds her and tosses her around to try and illicit a smile, but the little diva ain’t having it. This reel has a ton of negative comments… more than Carlin usually gets.  Folks say things about the amount of money they spend (someone says they spend money like “a drunken sailor”), how they never actually show up and work at their small business, and the blatant exploitation of their kids. Carlin doesn’t have to respond bc there are hundreds of fans willing to take up for them.  We learn that Evan’s entire family is coming to join this trip to celebrate his parent’s 50th wedding anniversary.  They came a week early so they can exploit without any nagging from his family.  Carlin is linking everything like crazy from panty liners to the car seats to the luggage including a large camera bag.  In the midst of all of the linked hygiene products there sits a lone wooden spoon.  Why would she need a wooden spoon in a carry-on bag?  Evan is hyper aware of what folks are saying so we quickly see Layla and Zade on the beach playing in the sand WITH the spoon.  No Beach toys… just a bowl from the hotel and this lone spoon.  I mean that totally clears it up. Carlin packed this spoon so her kids could play with it on the beach… one at a time.  Carlin links every toy and item she packed for her kids to have on the flight and Evan films Carlin helping Layla read bc home school can happen anywhere.  In Carlin’s IG grid post we see the family posing on the beach, the most basic food and Layla either playing up for the camera or sulking.  The weekly vlog takes us back to Easter and Evan is front and center with his Potato Head filling the entire screen.  They show the kids picking up the eggs they threw all over the AstroTurf and Carlin gushing about how much she loves being a mom.  Isn’t that a given?  I mean she’s pregnant with #3 at 27.  Is this unique information?  Evan puts money in ONE egg that Zade spots, but Layla grabs.  Zade looks on sadly as Layla rejoices in her win until Evan finally suggests they could buy something together.  As much as they love being parents, one might think they could set it up so BOTH kids win.  We see the usual filming in church, and Layla is being carried around by Carlin before singing in the kid’s choir. After lunch at the big house, they are off to the airport and Carlin tells us Kelly Jo planned their trip and itinerary. As quickly as possible they get Layla in a bathing suit so they can film her as she twists, twirls and throws faces for the camera.  Evan goes out to buy groceries on his own and that means he sets the camera up all over the place and films himself. Riveting.  The whole bunch head out on a boat ride for snorkeling and the subtitles are back for poor Zade.  Two weeks in Hawaii is 2 weeks he isn’t in speech therapy.  Carlin posts in full makeup, jewelry and hair done while wearing pajamas to fake cry about feeling her baby kick for the first time.  The staged excitement when she says this is the best day of her life is way over the top.  Reminder-3rd pregnancy.  Anyway, she calls the baby “he” again and acknowledges in the comments that “everyone” is telling her it is a boy.  She links every item of clothing she wears and it’s mostly H&M… just like Josie.  She hasn’t linked one BSB item so far.




2.The miniature swing set in Katie’s backyard took quite a beating this week when Hailey, Travis and the big dog, Remi all played on it at the same time.  Katie filmed and called Travis the “best dad” for this one tiny thing… Then she promotes it and links it and we know why he was out there to begin with.  It’s still $1000 too much.  Katie is back in the car to sell that money saving app again.  She tells the same story every time she sells it and I just don’t think canceling a subscription to Uber Eats is the reason these folks are living the lifestyle they have. Anyway, we also see Gil harassing Hailey in the backseat with a bear as they load up to leave the big house. Katie posts clips from the Tennessee baseball game where Lawson attempted to sing the National Anthem and she seems to be genuinely proud of him. Her ears are just broken at this point. The vlog this week shows the Clarks at the big house where Travis is helping on this mystery remodel project Zach told us about last week.  They only say it’s a small house and needs an open floor plan so it remains unclear if it’s a separate structure on the property or if they are finally refurbishing the dilapidated back of the house. In any case, what happens next truly scared my eyes.  Travis and Lawson wind up in a pull up contest started by Zach who does one pull up on a beam directly in front of Travis’ camera.  Mercy it was a… lot.  Before anyone could blink, Lawson has ripped his shirt off and hauled himself up on this beam where he does 15 pull ups and his tight jeans hang on for dear life. Travis refuses to take his shirt off and then whines that the beam hurts his hands...but old daddy Gil insists on having a turn himself.  He rips off 16 pull ups while we hear every bone in his body crack in stereo.  Lawson has to accept defeat but the real losers are all of us who witnessed that.  Travis is tasked with following Lawson around at the baseball game and filming him and it feels like a real “BIG ME, little you” move from Law.  They probably threatened Travis not to so much as HUM less they give Lawson the boot and ask Travis to take his spot.  The Clarks are at the big house for Easter and Katie says they are lumping this in with Mother’s Day bc Kelly won’t be home then.  Back at the McMansion Warden stops in to build a toy shelf and then Katie shows the walls and doors that Hailey has scribbled all over.  Like every single wall and every door pretty much.  They act surprised but when you are busy filming, editing and posting… what do you think your toddler is doing?  Katie tells us all about an upcoming girl’s trip while she cleans a stain off of her brand new white couch.  Turns out that girl’s trip was just 36 hours in NJ with Hailey for her sister in law’s baby shower.  Katie seems a bit frantic traveling alone with just Hailey, but Hailey is a breeze.  GiGi meets them at the airport where Hailey says “I missed you”.  She’s barely 2 and has her pronouns down pat.






3.Josie Balka has to keep up the pilates content all by herself while Carlin is busy doing the hula so she coerces Katie to tag along.  We see Willow and Hazel once again in their standard uniform of polyester princess dresses and Josie fully admits it is all that they wear.  Well, besides oversized beige attire.  Josie hasn’t filmed any new content for Effortless shop in quite a while and the shop is only featuring other influencers constantly taking their hair out of the pool noodle.  Is the trend dying down… finally?  Josie is back to selling makeup and it’s her new favorite.  Forget the whole spiel about how she only uses tinted moisturizer and it’s the best ever.  That was LAST month. How can anyone trust her opinion when she is totally in love with whatever company is sending her products and checks?  She would also like you to purchase her hair growth pills and she films herself flipping her hair at the camera and tapping all over the bottle with her fake nails to draw you in.  After we talked last week about not seeing Kelton in the kitchen, this week Josie shows off “Chef Kelton” at the grill at home and he cooked all of the meat for the Easter spread at the big house.  As he explains the food facing the camera his new eyebrows are arched more than McDonald’s and it appears some botox may have found its way to his temples.  Josie keeps trying with him… gotta give her that. During Easter Josie gathers her mom, Carlin, Lydia, Katie, Tiffy, Tori and Whitney to film the TikTok trend of pregnancy test roulette.  Such fun in a fertility cult.  The pee sticks are passed from one to the other with abandon and no hand sanitizer in sight.  The results reveal 2 positives we already know about… and a third not yet announced.  This sends commenters in to a frenzy of confusion because Josie filmed it, but tagged everyone and they all reposted it.  There’s so much to dissect here… these women have never seemed happier than playing this fertility game… they added their 58 year old mother who is beyond thrilled to be one of “the girls”… they filmed this specifically when their one sister who has trouble conceiving wasn’t there, but still flooded social media with it…and lastly…. Is this a thinly veiled ad for ClearBlue Easy?  This whole things should clear up the idea that these folks are totally progressive and have left their cult days behind.  Moving on… Josie drops old footage of taking Lydia to the Effortless Head Spa for her birthday.  They show their scalp consults and it was gross seeing the buildup on Josie’s hair.  You can treat yourself for upwards of $200.  Josie films a GRWM to remove a full face of makeup and sell yet another product.  This one is makeup remover and she needs a tin tub full of it.  She talks so fast and so lispy it is impossible to know what she’s really talking about.  She plays some game where you have to say what you would do if you started over in your career.  She mentions how much she loves “birth” and would want to be a doula but also adores what she does now which, according to her, is wedding makeup.  Doesn’t mention the influencing.  Before wrapping up the weekthe Balka’s are at the Farmer’s Market with their friends where she films her kids wandering around, eating doughnuts and drinking iced coffee.  Rinse and repeat.  Josie has one final surprise up her sleeve though... SHE is expecting.  Baby Miles is still trying to steady himself on 2 feet, but it’s time to grow up... Momma has a brand new embryo.  Josie is now pregnancy #5 which means Lawson was right all along and I can’t think of anything worse than Lawson Bates being right. Well, except for poor Josie’s pelvic floor.






4.It was a big, big week down at the Webster work camp. The kids got a trip to the park, their very own individual lunchable… and a small drink from the coffee shop.  They did have to wear their big clunky brown boots and agree to have their noses removed in mom’s pictures… but still.  Alyssa set her camera up so she could prance around in front of it and say she is living in her skort and tank top… and has Allie care for Rhett while she takes pictures of him making his scrunched up unhappy face.  Back at home, Alyssa tags Aldi, the phone cases and her water jug.  I hope the 58 cents commission she makes is what is buying the treats for the kids.  The Webster pool is open for the season and we see King Rhett in one of his sister’s floaties  I guess we know how tight Alyssa and John really are if they are willing to let their male child be photographed in a pink unicorn life vest…. He is also in the pool in a diaper and that’s gross and hopefully only happens at home.  In more breaking news, a friend convinced Alyssa to come over to her subdivision’s pool and let their kids play together.  Alyssa agreed bc the pool was deserted in the middle of the day and she was allowed to film all of the kids through her filter that washes away any joy or happiness.  Rhett is shown in the pink floatie and things just keeping getting worse for him bc this time he is also wearing the damn sad hat. Alyssa seems to have gotten her groove back and is no longer afraid of the world outside of her front door…. Which probably means John will want another baby soon.  The homeschool scholarship is really coming in clutch and the family (minus John) makes another trip to Sea World with the cousins.  Alyssa poses for a picture with her lover… the humongous iced coffee, and the kids line up obediently for the proof of life pictures. Bet those sea lions weren’t expecting to be filtered. Alyssa is also in her gardening era and shows tons of little vegetables and herbs she is planting around the porch at home.  Spring in Florida is so colorful and full of life and vibrancy but she works hard to strip the color away from everything.  Her filtered outlook on life matches her vibe… sepia toned and grainy with gloom pushing in from the edges.






5.Whitney Bates just wants to be relatable.  As a “busy mom of 5” she has forgotten to get her real ID.  Aw shucks, aw dang, y’all.  She’s traveling next week and has a girl’s trip coming up and needs that ID.  Hopefully she will get it on time y’all. Whitney wanted engagement with this story, and she got it.  She tells her viewers that she doesn’t own a passport bc she has no desire to ever travel outside of the good old US of A.   Zach shows off another steak dinner, this time with noodles and cheese all topped with olive oil.  His arteries are begging for mercy. He’s back out at his new griddle… this time to demonstrate how to season it correctly.  He wastes a ton of beef tallow doing this. Chad Paine is going to come running in from the shadows and grab that big vat of tallow so he and Erin can add some MLM oils to it and sell it!  Oil and grease are the themes this week as Whitney is also selling body oil.  She coats herself in it while she slips up and says she’s been spending a lot of time “out in the pool”… is that the secret they are keeping??  For some unknown reason, Zach reposts the pregnancy test reel featuring his wife, mom and all of his sisters.  Trying to drum up interest he adds the side eye emoji to the reel.  Whitney just adamantly said she was NOT pregnant in their q and a video so… guess he’s just trying to be one of the influencer girlies.  This week’s vlog is just another week of cobbled together chat with Warden.  Zach is devouring a hamburger while talking and keeps dipping it in a shared cup of sauce.  Warden looks like his stomach is turning but little Jaydon keeps wriggling around in his lap licking up the sauce while they talk.  Most of the questions are food related and every answer is just “steak” but we do learn that Gil isn’t really doing tree jobs now, and that Zach doesn’t like his dad’s work schedule.  Warden plays Fort Night with Zach’s kids and they talk about how music wasn’t allowed growing up so the boys would come to Zach’s, watch Madagascar and dance their hearts out. Warden works construction and paints lines in parking lots at night.  Zach will only say that Warden is “not married”.  Duh.  He’s 21 years old.  Let’s hope he stays single for quite a while.






6.Bless Lydia Bates heart… she is now on week 333 (33) of this never ending pregnancy that she has been preparing for the end of for 263 weeks.  This week she puts a bassinet in the corner of her room and links some maternity clothes.  She films a mini vlog of her baby checkup that is just her talking in the car, showing the inside of the doctor’s office, and then she’s back in the car and says it was too awkward to film anything.  Girl, that isn’t how Carlin Stewart made it to Hawaii for 2 weeks.  Awkward is not a word influencers know!  The baby is measuring 2 weeks behind and Lydia needs a growth scan.  She’s ready for the end, but it sounds like baby girl needs some more time.  By mid-week she totally gives up, sets up the camera pointing towards the couch, and films herself sleeping.  Finally Trace comes home and they can head to Florida.  On the 12 hour drive, Lydia regales us with fun facts like her due date of June 13 and that her favorite German meal is shoe leather steak and sad noodles.  Their vlog begins with a tour of the bedroom.  The tour is really just Lydia turning to the left, and then turning to the right but she’s super excited about ALL of the color she is adding.  ALL of the color is a blue pillow and a small blue blanket.  She shows off the baby’s clothes and a few pink outfits have snuck in. The sponsor this week is a beige rug.  Lydia’s sister is going on the vacation with them to act as Ryker’s baby sitter.  We get a house tour and it’s a super cool house that they are sharing with a friend named Hubert and his family.  Her sister gets to share a room with the other family’s babysitter for the week.  Doesn’t that sound fun and not at all miserable.






7.Spring time is when life begins anew with little babies and everything is bright and fresh and young.  Is anyone surprised then, that Erin Paine is knocked up once again?  I am pretty sure that Dr. Vick told Erin he GAVE her an extra third of an ovary, but she was groggy from the anesthesia and heard the whole thing wrong.  Then again, what else do these fools have to do?  Erin at least is trying to get you to buy her God cards and her doodled on note cards.  You can buy 5 cards for just $9.  The shipping is $4 though, so I’m finding it hard to believe this is a savvy business plan.  She wants to know if folks would like a subscription service for her tallow.  The only person I know who needs that much beef fat is brother Zach.  We see the Paine kids filing in to church on Wednesday evening and the girls all seem to have new haircuts.  Wonder if Erin does it herself, ala Michelle Duggar with a FlowBee?  Erin is super excited that the tallow is back in stock and she’s upped the prices.  There are now 2 sizes available and... drum roll please... man fat is also now available.  Men need their own masculine fat and Erin has created it.  Not sure who her test model is because we all know Chad’s hands are baby soft.  In the vlog where they announce the 7th baby, Erin is practically cooing as she rains praises on each child.  She goes overboard saying that they cried out to God and begged for a child for so long before Carles came along.  It’s all a bit much and she wraps it up by saying that she and Chad feel it is their calling in life to raise these children and point them to Jesus.  Jesus is pointing back Erin and telling you there’s more to it than just raising them.  You are supposed to educate them, feed them and give them some kind of an opportunity too.  Oh, and be able to remember their names.  That’s helpful.





8. Michael celebrates Easter by sharing tons of flower and tree pictures.  She tells the story of the Dogwood blossom and how it relates to the resurrection of Christ.  She and Brandon head to the Smoky Mountains for their church’s couples retreat and while there, they spot a bear.  She also sends huge congratulations to Erin on her announcement and gushes over the newest Balka to be. Gotta give her props for trying to roll with the flow and be a good sport.  In their new vlog they sit together at a desk and recap their Easter trip to Michigan.  They have shots of Brandon working with his dad, and his mom decorating tons of Easter goodies.They tell a story about baby bunnies that were separated from their mother and how the mom came back and rescued them. Michael says the Keilen farm is a great place to get away from it all.  I can just imagine her gathering her skirts, heading out to the middle of a cow field and screaming her lungs out.  I know I certainly would.  But instead... she just continues to keep sweet and turn the other cheek. (My dad used to tell my mom he was trying to be the bigger person and turn the other cheek but both of them were blistered!)  His mom baked, cooked and made it nice and next up they are going to tell another night-night story about their trip to Florida to visit his sister’s new baby.





9. Tiffany and Lawson spent another week stuck together at home in Nashville churning out nauseating content.  Dumb things like Tiffy complaining about her hubby trying to get her to like black coffee or how she’s the little woman who keeps them broke. She films a blank wall and shows how she added some Home Goods crap to it. Tiffany’s parents are in town again and she ruined a steak dinner for all of them not to enjoy. It’s just more shoe leather and gristle... maybe that should be their couple’s name.   She expresses how sad she gets when her parents go home.  I’m surprised they haven’t made the move to Tennessee yet.  Esther is still just about the only Bates that keeps in contact with Tiffany, and we see the 2 of them on a facetime together with baby Graham.  Baby Will is getting 2 teeth and starting to crawl.  They have a robin’s nest full of eggs in that tree Lawson loves to climb and that makes me wonder... where the heck is Duke the dog? We need to put an APB out on his whereabouts bc since he took Kelly Jo down... he hasn’t been seen.  Lawson has a new song coming out all about Poppa Bill and the title has everyone thinking the poor man is dead already.  I can’t decide if exploiting your innocent children is worse, better or the same as exploiting your elderly grandfather who is suffering from dementia... but Lawson does it all.  It’s another maudlin dirge with a 6th grade rhyming scheme where he screeches around notes while standing out in the road patting his chest and pointing in to the distance.  Tiffany promotes it heavily all week by commenting that it’s “so sad about Lawson’s granddad”.  Truly it seems they want people to be confused about his health.  She also posts a reel where she flicks Lawson in the throat because she’s furious that he is right.  It would have been so much better if she karate chopped him, but we’ll take what we can get.  We now know the trip they made to the farm was strictly so Lawson could film a music video for this mess of a song and I wish I could read Momma Jane’s thoughts when that crew pulled away.  Lawson gives a shout out to Carlin and Evan for helping them capture so many memories for them.  Does that mean they are editing?  If so... Evan is slow as hell bc they haven’t had a timely vlog in weeks. They do head to the big house for Easter and her parents join them.  Tiffany is overjoyed to be invited to join the “it girls” in their pregnancy baiting reel. She ends the week by showing us how she is teaching baby Will to smile on cue.  He needs to learn his lessons well and fast bc daddy’s new song is not going to be selling out stadiums.

When they don’t immediately sell out, they drop the prices on all of the brand new items by $20-35 and finally sell those $50 T-shirts for half price...Kelly Jo says Happy Birthday to Emerson who she barely knows.

1ka9fwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisville/comments/1ka9fwo/housing_close_to_uofl_hospital/,Housing close to UofL Hospital,"hi 👋 i’m moving to Louisville for a fellowship at UofL Hospital and need some housing advice. My bf will be living with me part-time while working in another city. 

Our budget is up $2,5K

I currently don’t have a car 🚙 and am learning to drive, so I prefer a location that minimizes commuting. I'm looking for a well-maintained “NEW STYLISH more on luxury side “place.

Ideally, I’d like to live in a WALKABLE area with coffee shops, restaurants, and parks, though my initial preference is to be CLOSE TO HOSPITAL 

I’m not sure how I can combine all of it lol but that’s what I’m looking for 
- New or remodel, clean and well-maintained
- Proximity to the hospital - up to 20 min walking it’s ok , but close is better 
- Safe neighborhood.. I know that lots unhoused ppl around, i would prefer to stay more away from them.., 
- Spacious with plenty of natural light, big windows, new kitchen, preferably light- hate dark rooms with small windows , great if windows view on nature trees but i guess too much to ask if close to hospital.. 
- Near parks or nature, some outdoor areas with green grass tree etc 
- Access to coffee shops and restaurants
- Ideally has a pool and hot tub
- ideally has gym but I saw most of the gyms are not good 

I've checked out places like :
Martin on Main, 
Main & Clay,
Grocers Ice Loft
Elevate
Highland Station
Edge etc..
Townhouse at Phoenix Hill
Billy Goat ? 😏😏

Highland Station seems spacious lots of medical personal live there I really like it on pictures not sure how well maintained it is ..

Martin on Main is newer but it looks smaller rooms no outside space ?

Main Clay - pretty good not sure how to differentiate between all of them hehe 

I’m also considering townhouses at Phoenix Hill, but I’m unsure about their maintenance in reality. Unfortunately, I can’t visit these places before moving to Louisville.

I’m not working nights, so a 20-minute walk is manageable if the area is safe. I plan to buy a car eventually, but I want a smooth transition at first.

If you have any suggestions or insights about other places, I’d really appreciate it!

Thanks!🥰🥰🥰

1ka9fs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1ka9fs7/issues_after_replacing_ninja_luxe_porta_filter/,Issues After Replacing Ninja Luxe Porta Filter Funnel with 3D Printed Part,"Hey everyone,  
I have a **Ninja Luxe (US version)** and recently, like many of you, the porta filter's funnel broke. I found a friend who owns a 3D printer, and I came across this design online:  
👉 [Ninja Luxe Café Funnel (Better Fit)](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1105963-ninja-luxe-cafe-funnel-better-fit#profileId-1101796)

We printed it and installed it, but I'm facing a couple of issues:

* **Tamping feels way too tight** now — much harder than it was with the original funnel.
* **Grinder stops abruptly after 2-3 seconds** when trying to grind directly into the porta filter, and I barely get **\~2 grams of coffee** before it cuts off.

I'm wondering:

* Does Ninja have a way of detecting that a 3D printed part is being used?
* Could the tight fit or slight design variations from the 3D model be causing the grinder to jam or trigger some kind of safety stop?
* Has anyone successfully used a 3D printed replacement without these problems?

TLDR: looking for recommendations for a dealership (not for service, to buy from) in FL, between Tampa area and Ocala area west of Orlando. 

We’re in the market for a 5th wheel, we originally planned to stay in our travel trailer until we could get the 5th wheel of our dreams, but the TT needs more work than it’s worth (long story, don’t cheap out, don’t buy 3 weeks after a hurricane) so we want to upgrade sooner than later. We’re looking to buy something used that’s in good shape (we’ll have an inspection done) in the $40k-$60k range and put 50% or more down and get a 5 year or less loan. Looking for a dealership roughly in the Tampa-Ocala area so we can get it delivered to our lot as we don’t have a 5th wheel hitch yet (we have the truck, just not the hitch). Anyone have experiences with dealerships in this area? Good or bad? I was going to check out Optimum but the few people I’ve talked to said their used selection is usually just POS trailers. Already know better than to try Camping World. Found a few horror stories about General RV. 

Also looking for some recommendations on a rig, our must haves are- decent insulation (full time in FL heat), multiple AC units, 50a service, dual slides for living room, separate living area and kitchen, king size bed with at least one slide in the bedroom, decent sized shower, closet with hanging space for shirts, space for a desk (fine with taking out dinette to put in desk), and enough counter space that I can leave my coffee pot out full time. Would like a washer/dryer as well as an outside fridge, but can live without those. We will be full time, mostly in FL with a few trips a year up to the mountains in NC plus trips out to Texas or up to IL once every few years. Looking for 40’-45’ ideally. 

Any input is appreciated, thanks in advance!!",1,1745881842.0,RVLiving,4,0.67,False

Millions of people worldwide start their day with a cup of coffee, but have you ever wondered about the impact of caffeine on your liver? As one of the most consumed psychoactive substances globally, caffeine's effects on liver function have intrigued researchers for years. This comprehensive exploration delves into the intricate relationship between caffeine consumption and liver health, revealing surprising insights that could change how you view your daily brew.

Understanding Caffeine's Interaction with the Liver

Caffeine is more than just a morning pick-me-up. Its complex interactions with the human body, particularly the liver, have been the subject of numerous scientific studies. Let's break down how this popular stimulant affects one of our most crucial organs.

The Metabolic Process of Caffeine

When you consume caffeine, your liver plays a critical role in processing this compound. Here's what happens:

• Caffeine is primarily metabolized in the liver
• The enzyme cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) breaks down most of the caffeine
• Metabolism rate varies between individuals based on genetic factors
• About 95% of caffeine is processed through this metabolic pathway

Potential Protective Effects of Caffeine on Liver Health

Surprisingly, research suggests that caffeine might offer some protective benefits for liver function:

1. Reduced Risk of Liver Disease
Multiple studies have shown that regular coffee consumption may:
• Lower the risk of liver cirrhosis
• Decrease the progression of liver fibrosis
• Potentially protect against liver cancer

Oxidative Stress and Liver Protection

**Caffeine's antioxidant properties** play a significant role in liver health. These properties can:
• Neutralize harmful free radicals
• Reduce inflammation
• Support overall liver cell protection

The Impact of Excessive Caffeine Consumption

While moderate caffeine intake may offer benefits, excessive consumption can have negative consequences:

Potential Negative Effects:
• Increased stress on liver enzymes
• Potential interference with medication metabolism
• Risk of developing fatty liver disease with excessive consumption

Factors Affecting Caffeine's Liver Impact

Several factors influence how caffeine affects liver function:
• Individual metabolism
• Genetic variations
• Overall health status
• Concurrent alcohol consumption
• Existing liver conditions

Recommended Caffeine Intake for Liver Health

Experts suggest:
• Limit caffeine to 400mg per day (about 4 cups of coffee)
• Monitor individual tolerance
• Consider personal health conditions
• Consult healthcare professionals for personalized advice

Scientific Evidence and Research Insights

Recent studies have provided compelling evidence about caffeine's relationship with liver health:
• A 2021 study in BMC Public Health showed reduced liver cancer risk
• Research in the Journal of Hepatology demonstrated protective mechanisms
• Ongoing studies continue to explore caffeine's complex liver interactions

Practical Recommendations for Liver Health

To optimize liver function while enjoying caffeine:
1. Maintain moderate consumption
2. Stay hydrated
3. Eat a balanced diet
4. Exercise regularly
5. Avoid excessive alcohol consumption

Conclusion

The relationship between caffeine and liver function is complex and nuanced. While moderate caffeine consumption appears to offer potential protective benefits, individual factors play a crucial role. Understanding your body's unique response and maintaining a balanced approach is key to supporting optimal liver health. Always consult with healthcare professionals to develop a personalized strategy that works best for your individual needs and overall well-being.",1,1745881679.0,liverhealth1,0,1.0,False

It’s like the universe decided to throw all the chaos, drama, and work-related madness into one day just to test our patience. If you’ve ever had a Monday at work that felt like it was straight out of a sitcom, then you know exactly what I mean.

First, there's the struggle of waking up after a weekend that felt way too short. You stare at the alarm clock, wondering how time flew by so quickly. You drag yourself out of bed, mentally preparing for the day ahead, but deep down, you’re questioning why you ever agreed to this 9-to-5 life.

Then, there’s the office drama that seems to magically appear on Mondays. From the coworker who’s already running late and blaming it on “traffic” (even though they live 5 minutes away), to the person who somehow found a way to have an opinion about every single thing that went on over the weekend. They might as well have been the ones making the decisions, right?

And let’s not forget the endless supply of emails flooding in. You open your inbox, and it’s a tidal wave of “urgent” requests, meetings that could have been emails, and “Did you see that email from last Friday?” moments that make you question whether anyone else knows what’s going on.

By the time the clock strikes noon, you’re already mentally checking out, and the thought of a coffee break feels like a mini-vacation. But hey, it’s only Monday, right? Just four more days of this madness.

Anyone else have that “Monday work drama” that’s just so absurd it could be a plotline for a show? Share your stories below, I’m sure we’re all in this together.",22,1745881505.0,office,2,0.97,False

There were a lot of peoples trip reports and info I received that really helped make this trip a great one. This was my first trip to Hawai’i ever. I will absolutely be back. It was one of my favorite trips. 

I felt very much welcome, and felt nothing short of the aloha spirit when I was there. The locals were friendly, people were helpful, and being able to learn about the culture and history of Hawai’i was amazing.

In total, I drove 563 miles around the beautiful island of Maui during my time. Here is my trip report. I hope you enjoy…

Thursday 4/17/25: 

I arrived into OGG @ 12:30pm. I went to college for aviation, and funny enough one of my friends who is a pilot was one of the ones flying me from PHX-OGG. It was super cool to catch up with him after a decade. Once I arrived it wasn’t too long before I was able to retrieve my bags and my rental car. A slight mix up at the Hertz gold car rental. My name was not up on the board but it took the agents only a few minutes to get me squared away. Was pretty hungry at that point and so I ended up going into downtown Paia to hit Paia Fish Market. The food there was so good and fresh! After that I drove to my Airbnb which was in a condo about 10 minutes north of Lahaina. Stopped at the Papawai Scenic Lookout on my way up. Stopped at ABC Stores a few minutes from my Airbnb to pick up local craft beer, sunscreen, musubis, etc. For the evening I sat outside of my condo and watched whales out in the distance, Additionally saw some turtles come up and were eating the algae off the rocks. I chatted it up with an older man at the condo who was a regular. He suggested I go to Dollie’s for some happy hour pizza and beer. The pizza was okay… but for 9 bucks for 2 slices of pizza and a draft beer ya couldn’t beat it. It was a relaxing start to the day. 

Friday 4/18/25: 

I was up pretty at 3:30am because of the time change. In retrospect this was the day I should have done the Haleakala sunrise. I had a nice morning walk to Bad Ass Coffee of Maui and got an iced coffee. Ended up walking over to Honokowai Park to enjoy the morning. Had breakfast a little bit farther north @ Honolua Store #89. Ended up having loco moco and it was delicious. I drove a bit to the north side of the island to see the Nakalele Blowhole. It sprinkled a little bit on the drive but an absolutely beautiful drive. It is pretty crazy how powerful the blowhole is even from a distance. From there I ended up going to Honokohau lookout. After that, I drove over and sat atop Punalua beach and was just enjoying the sights and listening to the ocean for a while. Drove over to Honolua bay. I went to Napili Beach to enjoy time on the beach for a little while. After all that for the morning I went back to the condo to hydrate and sit outside in the sun for a while before lunch. I went to Miso Phat Sushi in Lahaina and got there right when it opened at 1130a. It already started filling up at that point.  Got the catch of the day which was the mahi mahi with rice and asparagus. Went back to the condo to see more whales out in the distance, but it became pretty rainy in the afternoon and was pretty consistent for a few hours. So, decided to go to Foodland Farms to get some local goodies. Poke bowl, ube mochi, musubis, chocolates, Maui onion chips, etc. Tried to go to Maui Brewing in Kanaapali Friday night but they didn’t take walk ins… who would’ve thought. Decided instead to just get dinner at FIsh Market Maui and got the fish of the day plate. The older regular I met on Thursday told me of turtles on Pohaku park. So I went and saw those before turning in for the night. 

Saturday 4/19/25: 

Drove down to Kihei and got to Kihei cafe @ 7:45am. Waited in line for a bit. Got loco moco again for breakfast….I got to Makena beach about 8:45a. It was paid parking but a lot of space and availability when I arrived. Relaxed on the beach for a couple hours there and got some cool views of the Molokini crater. Decent amount of boats out there at 9a. It started getting cloudy so I drove up to Kaulahoa beach to see the see turtles. At about 11:30a there were a lot of turtles there. 15 +. Relaxed there from a while watching the turtles until lunch time. Drove to Plantation Plates food truck a lot of food trucks near the airport and got some kalua pork. On the way back i stopped at Olowalu General store next to Leona’s for some local coffee for the mornings. Relaxed in prep for road to Hana. 

Sunday 4/20/25:

This was my guided tour and honestly it was a blast. Booked it through TripAdvisor and it was through Valley Isle Excursions. Our tour driver was a Hana local and was very knowledgeable about the culture. We started at the Maui Tropical Plantation for breakfast. On the way stopped at the very colorful and big eucalyptus trees. We stopped at halfway to Hana for banana bread… so good. We also stopped at Hana Farms. For lunch, we stopped at Kailanis Gift Shop where we ate Huli huli chicken and some other goodies. After that… we went to Waianapanapa State Park and saw the black sand beach. Stayed there for a bit. After we went and swam at Pua akaha waterfall. It is a fresh water waterfall and was very… refreshing. At the end of our tour we stopped at Hookipa beach to see more turtles. I’d highly recommend a guided tour. Made enjoying so easy. For dinner i stopped at the Honoapiilani Food Truck Park for fish tacos from Hooked and malasadas from Aloha Sweets. 

Monday 4/21/25: 

It was a chill morning got up about 645a. Had some of the Hawaiian coffee and chocolate chip banana bread from Hana. Went out to Ukumehame Beach Park to chill on the beach and get some quick sun in the morning. From about 8-10a. Then I left to quickly check out the Iao Needle. BE MINDFUL of this as you need a reservation which I did not know. The guy at the entrance was nice and when i explained i was just trying to look and he let me in. Stopped at Aloha Mixed Plate for lunch and got more loco moco with fried rice and a mai tai. After that I stopped at the Lahaina Cannery to go grab a new hat from Kai Aloha. 

That night was my luau at Old Lahaina Luau. This is the only one I’ve ever done but i thought it was super great. The food and service was amazing. Unlimited drinks too. The dancing and history about Hawai’i and Polynesia was super informative and entertaining. Would highly recommend. You got a LOT of food and drink and even though it was expensive i think it was worth it.

Tuesday 4/22/25: 

This was Haleakala sunrise day. I left from Lahaina at 1:48a and got to the top of the summit at 354a. Honestly, it was a pretty straight forward drive. All the roads were paved and i had cell service basically up until i got to the summit. The higher you got there were a few steep drop offs but overall i think i would’ve preferred this over the road to Hana. Getting to the summit at 354a there was still a lot of parking available up there. Better to be early than late… because by around 515a i already saw people having to go back down because the lot at the summit was full. Be mindful that the bathroom is at the visitor center that’s .5 miles down the road so if you need to use it… stop there before heading up to the summit. PREP for cold… I am from Buffalo NY and it was cold for me… mid 30s with a breeze. Bring warm clothes for sure.  It was cool to see how clear the night sky was out there. Air is thin… so use caution. 

Stopped at Jacks Inn for breakfast coming down from the mountain. Really good hole in the all breakfast spot… and guess what… again i got loco moco for breakfast lmao. Probably had that every day. Napped at the condo because the 115a wake up sort of sucked. Went out to Puunene to do some volunteering for Feed My Sheep. Got hooked up through the HandsonMaui website. Helped sort food and some other things for a few hours. They help deliver fresh food to different parts of the island. Laid pretty low after that. Walked down to Fish Market Maui for more goodies. Had the tacos this time. 

Wednesday 4/23/25: 

Went for my Whale Watching Tour. Also booked through Trip Advisor. This one left out of Maalaea Harbor on the Quicksilver. We did not see some whales for the longest time. We saw some blowing water up and at some point the captain called it back in that we did not see a whale. I guess with this company if you don’t see one you actually get to go back out for free another day. We did end up seeing a mother and her baby whale out there towards the end. After that, I went to monkey pad kitchen in Kihei because I had a hula show to go to later on. The Mai tai is an absolute must there. I also have the pork Bulgogi tacos and the vegan tortilla soup. Both were very good. They make all of their food fresh in the restaurant. I would highly recommend checking out that location. I went to Ulua Beach for a quick stop. I found a nice spot in the shade because the two hour boat ride was hot and I think I actually got a little sunburn. my hula show was at South Maui Gardens. It was an absolutely beautiful area. The hula show started at five, but it was recommended to get there at 4:30 PM to check in. I decided not to have the luau style dinner because there are a lot of food trucks on the premises. I ended up getting a burger from burger, boys Maui food truck. The hula show was quite a little bit different than the luau however, there were a lot of similarities as well. The luau at old Lahaina luau did not have the fire dancing. However, the hula show did.. I think it was beneficial and enjoyable to go to both of those even though I sort of paid for two, it definitely gave a different experience.

Thursday 4/24/25: 

Woke up and checked out of the Airbnb. My first stop was Maui ocean center which was really cool. A great place to spend some time especially if you have little ones. Don’t forget you have to pay to park in that lot. They are big sticklers on that so you will get towed or ticketed if you don’t. I got gas, vacuumed my car… and of course went back to Jacks Inn for breakfast because it was just so good. And… you guessed it. Loco moco once again. Prime example of hole in the wall place. So good. I stopped to chill at Kaulahoa beach again… needed to burn some time before heading up to the airport. I decided to drive up country since I hadn’t yet on the trip. Went up to Roadddogs food truck and got a bacon ranch hot dog and some shave ice. This was located in the town of Makawao. I couldn’t help myself and also stopped at Mahalo Aleworks for a quick beer. Then….i dropped off my car and got to the airport. If you are planning to be at the airport early that is fine but just be mindful you CANNOT check your bags more than 4 hours before your flight.

A Town That Multiplies Overnight

On paper Seaside Heights is a cozy 2,400-resident borough.  By midsummer Friday night, the crowd swells past 65 000 people—a 2 500 % pop-off that turns every street into a low-key festival ground.  That tidal wave of flip-flops guarantees shoulder-to-shoulder customers for arcades, coffee bars, and short-term rentals all season long. 

Real-Estate Rocket Fuel

Back in 2005 you could snag a shore bungalow for roughly $261 k.  Two decades later the Zillow Home-Value Index clocks in at about $688 k, a +163 % climb that beats the Dow, Bitcoin’s five-year average, and your best friend’s sneaker portfolio.  Homes here now run 32 % pricier than the Ocean-County median, proof that buyers pay a premium for a seven-block walk to the sand. 

Visitors Who Literally Pay to Stand on Sand

The borough’s “Beach Utility” set an all-time record in 2022: $2.47 million in badge sales and $2.21 million in metered-parking cash—up 27 % from the pandemic rebound year.  That haul bankrolls fireworks, lifeguards, and the free concerts that keep tourists coming back. 

Short-Term-Rental Gold Mine

988 active Airbnbs/VRBOs

51 % average occupancy

$417 average nightly rate

Roughly $30.4 k median annual host revenue

AirDNA “Investability” score: 56/100


Translation for non-numbers people: even if you only fill half your calendar, your beach condo can pay for itself before Labor Day. 

Skyline Shake-Ups

Remember the old Bamboo and Karma clubs?  Say hello to “Coastal Edge,” a $50-million mixed-use complex bringing luxury condos, retail, and a rooftop stage to the Boulevard.  Just down the boardwalk, the state dropped $10.2 million to future-proof the planks, with another $1.021 million phase kicking off this fall.  LED lighting approved for 2025 will slash boardwalk power use by about 40 % and keep Insta-selfies bright after midnight. 

Built to Withstand the Next Sandy

The federally funded $150-million dune and beach-replenishment project now armors the shoreline from Manasquan Inlet to Barnegat Inlet, cutting post-storm repair payouts by roughly 90 %.  Translation: your investment is safer than ever. 

Safer Streets, Happier Feet

Violent-crime rates have plunged 59 % since 2011, and property-crime numbers are half what they were in 2015.  Put simply, families strolling at dusk worry more about dropping funnel-cake sugar than their phones. 

Family-First Upgrades

A $897 000 inclusive playground opens in 2025 along the bayfront, plus the century-old carousel spins again in a climate-controlled pavilion.  Parents can sip cold brew while the kids burn off cotton-candy calories. 

Wired for the Future

Twelve public EV charging ports already dot the peninsula, with many more in queue as new hotels break ground.  Road-tripping Tesla owners now plan bathroom breaks here—and tend to spend while they wait. 

Jobs, Jobs, Jobs

Local businesses posted 153 seasonal openings this spring, a quick barometer of economic heat.  Work the summer rush, then hit Rutgers or Rowan with tuition money saved. 

Statewide Tailwind

New Jersey tourism smashed records with 120.5 million visitors in 2023, and the Shore counties grabbed the biggest slice of that pie.  When the macro tide rises, every beach chair floats. 

Fun That Never Sleeps

Casino Pier has re-expanded past 35 rides—from its sky-high Ferris wheel to the Hydrus coaster that corkscrews over the surf—ensuring each summer feels new even for day-trip regulars. 

Little Grants, Big Glow-Up

Between playground funds, streetscape money, and arts-district seed cash, Seaside pulled $2.2 million in public-space grants just since 2023.  Your property’s curb appeal gets an annual polish—on somebody else’s dime.

The Bottom Line

Seaside Heights has quietly outgrown its reality-TV era and turned into a juggernaut of visitor traffic, rising property values, smart infrastructure, and family-friendly polish—all backed by numbers any accountant would love.  Whether you’re hunting an Airbnb cash cow, a forever-home with salt air, or just want a cold brew under neon lights, the data say get in before the next wave crests.

After trying out so many different specialty coffees made with the best espresso machines, I came into the realization that I already make the best espresso for me using my medium dark home roast. The taste just get too intensely acidic for me as espresso with these special beans, also has less body. Even my dream machine, the La Marzocco Leva X, which I was allowed to pull a shot produced a shot I didn't like. That said, these specialty coffees were delicious as pour overs. Totally different experience.
Note: even the espresso with the San Remo (2 group, forget the model)  produced a very thin bodied, almost no crema, really acidic shot.",0,1745881443.0,espresso,1,0.2,False

The reason I can’t see that person (or anyone else) is because they don’t see God and therefore there is no future for us, since God is in my everyday life and I would love to share it.

1ka99rd,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ka99rd/sciatica_and_caffeine/,Sciatica and caffeine.,"Maybe I am way off the mark here, but here goes. 

I am currently undergoing a bout of sciatica that has lasted 2+ weeks. I’ve only ever had it once before c. 7-8 years ago and to the best of my recollection, it went away on its own (can’t recall how long it took).

I am finding it difficult to get sustained relief this time around. It has occurred to me that there may be a connection between my sciatica and my coffee habit and it’d be a good opportunity to try quitting caffeine (again). It really feels like a sign from the universe this time that something has to change.

I’m looking for anyone with experience with this and if they noticed a connection between their sciatica and caffeine consumption and if their symptoms lessened or disappeared entirely upon quitting caffeine.

Any input is greatly appreciated.

I've been working as a barista for less than a month. Before this, the only sort of ""cafe"" experience I've had is working in tea rooms, all of which have been open about what kind of tea/what brands they use and how they prepare the tea, and sometimes even down to the plantation it came from, if it's a shop that has enough volume. At the very least, I've always been able to tell people the brand and country of origin.

I recently started working at a coffee shop that has been very clear that they don't want people to know what they're brewing. (The coffee is from a chain store brand, but their coffee is decent.) Not only do they not want people to know, but I was advised to say it was a totally different brand, which they haven't used in a while. (And if I'm being honest, the store brand coffee they use is miles better than the brand they lie about having!)

It's not like people are going to stop coming if they know where to get the coffee. There are other things staff lie about, but I won't get into those here. Why lie about it? And is that a common practice?",49,1745881388.0,barista,44,0.99,False
1ka98zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalPsychology/comments/1ka98zg/feeling_discouraged/,Feeling Discouraged,"Hey everyone! I’m finishing up my undergrad in December and plan on trying to jump straight into grad school. I’ve always been interested in psych, but quit school in my early 20s because of family issues. Ended up starting my own coffee shop (been in the industry a while) and did that. Somewhere in my mid 20s I developed panic disorder, GAD, etc. One panic attack and my whole world flipped upside down. After a few years of ups and downs, I had a very bad mental health year. Split with a long term partner, best friend died with cancer and grandfather passed. This all happened within a span of a few months. I had to leave my job and move back in with a family member because I ended up developing agoraphobia.

My passion for mental health advocacy obviously stems from my personal battle with it and I’d love to help people with the same struggles. 

My fear is that I won’t ever be able to”healthy” enough to do it. I’m not housebound, but it is a grind to leave the house at the moment. I haven’t done a long drive in a while due to the fear. I’m managing a part time job at a coffee shop, currently run some catering events and roast coffee with my own company, but just feeling worried and discouraged about the future.

Hey all! So I’ve been using Fina Money for a little while now and honestly, it’s made my life so much easier. I used to be the kind of person who’d jot down expenses on paper or use a random app but Fina money has been way more organized and simple. The auto categorization feature is clutch especially for someone like me who tends to forget where all my money went by the end of the month.

One thing I’m still trying to figure out is how to actually stick to my saving goals. I feel like I get distracted by little things like impulse buys or extra coffee runs. Anyone else got tips on how to stay on track with your goals?

You can tell by my username who i am focused on and its not dereck. When we were talking about joelle like this, he told her to embrace it. He said haters are the most dedicated fans you can have and shes lucky. I can pull the video if yall want to see it. His ""dear public"" letter on tiktok caught our teams attention. I asked FG when this happened to her and she gave me the date range to search our archives. That's how we had the video of him saying he SAd her ""a month ago"". If he had the brains to shut up and keep his drama to himself we wouldn't have went digging fir evidence to assist ger in her SA case. He brought this on himself. He's saying we are stalking him but he is an influencer... a creator and he posts PUBLICLY. We just react to it, publicly. If we are stalking him... what's pixie doing? Or tdawg? Or Molly? Are they obsessed losers too? How were they ok with him acting like that every night? He says we sped it up to make him look like a piece of shit? No. We sped it up for tiktok because no one wants to sit through 28 minutes of that vile rage fest. We didn't piece it together or put words in his mouth. He said it and we recorded it because that's what we do. We are the watchers and we are damn good at taking down liars, scammers and abusers. This is our hobby.
