Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

i'm namely thinking of the end scene, when the whole squad is celebrating at the bar and holding up what looks like beer, clearly at least most of the detectives should be able to tell that the consistency of what they're holding is in no way similar to beer.
and even though scully and hitchcock have been known to always be up for free food and drinks, it's been proven in the episode with the pie and also the one with the lasagna that they have a really keen sense of observation when it comes to that kind of stuff.

1 - To make it a paid app like less than a coffee price but I doubt if users would download the paid app and it would be bad if they don't find any user after paying for the app.

2 - Receive the payment only for users who wants the probiotic and only when atleast one user exists who wants to share their batch.

I’m a 22-year-old guy, recently left by my 20-year-old girlfriend. It’s not the most dramatic story out there, but I wanted to share my experience somewhere. We were together for 11 months. We met at work. She was new, and I was her mentor. That’s how it all started. Things were great in the beginning. We even went on a small road trip early on, but during that trip, she got some bad news: her ex had been in a serious motorcycle accident. For context, her ex was mentally abusive and cheated on her before they broke up. She and I had talked about him before, and I thought she was completely over it. When she heard about the accident, she was visibly upset. She explained that while she hated what he did to her, it was still hard to hear about something like that happening to someone she used to know. I understood and supported her. Our relationship was closed, and she was a little jealous at times. I saw it as a sign she cared about me. But one night, she told me she was going out for coffee with a friend, which was fine by me. That “coffee,” however, turned into a night out at a local bar with live music. I wasn’t upset that she went out, it was the fact that she lied about her plans. To make matters worse, this friend of hers didn’t have the best reputation. Later, I stumbled across a story on Instagram from the bar, and there they were, standing at a table. I gave her the chance to tell me the truth, but she lied, saying she was already heading home. When I confronted her, she admitted she lied because she was scared I’d be upset. I made it clear that all I ever wanted was honesty. She apologized, and we moved on. Things seemed to go back to normal, and for the most part, we were happy again. Fast forward a month, I was scrolling Instagram and noticed that she was following her ex. They hadn’t been following each other before, which surprised me given everything she had said about him. I asked if there was anything she wanted to tell me, and she said no. When I confronted her, she broke down, saying she was scared I’d break up with her if I knew. She claimed it didn’t mean anything and that she just wanted to see if he had something to say. She begged me not to leave, saying I was her other half and she couldn’t imagine life without me. We had a long, honest talk, and I told her to come clean about anything else. She promised that was it and said she’d unfollow him in a few days. I believed her, and we moved forward again. A couple of days later, she started an argument out of nowhere, saying, “I can follow whoever I want, you’re not controlling me.” It felt like it came out of left field, and I told her she needed to figure out what she wanted. I gave her space to think, and after five hours, I asked if we were continuing as normal or not. She said, “Not.” I was devastated but tried to make things right. She insisted we could work on things, like we had done before. But then a friend told me he saw her at a café with her ex. I knew the café because they used to go there when they were together. When I confronted her, she got defensive, saying we weren’t technically together at the time, so she could do what she wanted. She then admitted she had texted him to see how he was after the accident because she “didn’t want to have enemies.” That was it for me. I went to her place to get my apartment key, and we said goodbye. She was cold, distant, nothing like the person I fell in love with. Later, she texted me, saying she had started losing feelings but didn’t know how to tell me. She thought those feelings would pass, but they didn’t. We stopped talking three days ago. She seems happy now, posting selfies, going out, unbothered. Meanwhile, I can’t sleep, eat, or focus. To make it worse, I have to drive past the café where they hung out to get to my apartment. I’ve seen her car there twice, once during a live music event and another time just sitting there. That’s it. I just needed to share this somewhere. She pursued me, made it seem like she’d never do something like this, but here we are. If you’ve read this far, thank you for listening.",1,1731765216.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Choice 1 : extra point in agility with legendary perk + 4 luck pieces of Union + 1 agility piece of Union + seared venison with berries = 18 base luck + 7 luck from food (7.5) + 8 from PA = 33 luck for crit every second shot + 30 agility (without food)

Choice 2 : extra point in luck with legendary perk + 2 luck piece of Union + 3 agility pieces of Union +seared venison with berries = 18 base luck + 7 luck from food (7.5) + 4 from PA + 5 from legendary perk = 34 luck for crit every second shot + 29 agility (without food)

Choice 3 : no luck food with extra point in luck with legendary perk = 18 base luck + 7 food + 10 from 5 pieces of PA (every luck piece) + 5 extra point in luck with legendary perk = 33 luck but no additional point in agility (23 from my build/mutation in PA)

Choice 4  : full agility - no crit every second shot : 5 extra points in agility with legendary perk + 5 agility pieces of power armor = 38 agility.

So what are your thoughts ?

I wonder if crits every 2 shots really so important cause more agility will be more vats fire (so more confort)

If I quit my job, I will be taxed at 200k, the same rate as before, but I’m wondering if I found a part time job and made 20k, can I still 50% of my capital gains?  20+100k?.  Or should I open a corporation and control how much I withdrawal?",1,1731765161.0,PersonalFinanceCanada,4,1.0,False

Would anyone be up for a rock climbing session (on me), a gym buddy (also on me), or just a casual coffee chat?","I’ve always enjoyed being on my own and embracing activities solo. As a schizoid, I prefer being a loner (not lonely), but my therapist thinks it’s time I step out of my comfort zone—so here I am, looking to connect with like-minded people and explore what it’s like to engage socially.

My interests include reading, biking, rock climbing (bouldering), zone 2 running(not when it’s cold outside 🥶), playing RPGs on my console, and occasionally building side projects. Fitness is a huge passion of mine—I hit the gym 5–6 days a week and love discussing nutrition, diet, and helping people start their workout journey. If you’re looking for some free advice or just enjoy talking about fitness, mental health, or tech, we’d definitely have something to chat about. I work in tech and I enjoy what I do. Yeah, I love my work and I am excited on Mondays😅

As an introvert(obviously😅) with ADHD, I know meeting people can be a challenge, but I’m open to it. If you’d like to meet up, I go bouldering(rock climbing) on weekends and can bring a guest to try it out. Alternatively, I’ll be also going to the gym for a workout today and can bring one person along for a fun session. If none of that sparks interest, we can always just grab a coffee and have a good conversation.

I am looking for a friends group right now since I won't survive Manila without people to yap and socialize with. Currently, I have no friend groups in med school and I kinda gave up on joining, because I just found out there's a lot of toxicity within some friend groups. I just wanna become a doctor at peace. That's why I am here to hopefully to find new friends!

I'd prefer if it has a great balance of work/acad-gaming life since I am a gamer too but can't play since my PC is not at in my condo rn. I would also love to co-work/study with you. SInce I am a shy person, it would take time for me to get comfy with opening my camera and talk, but hey if we vibe, baka ako pa yung maging maingay.

Growing up I've always gone from friend group to friend group. But I've always had one particular close circle of friends that I've always been able to really on. We're all between 21 and 24, me being 23 myself. And just for context I live at home with my mom. (There's very specific family distance reasons to this). But anyway, my step dad lives a couple hours away and every other weekend my mom goes to see him, and the weekends inbetween my step dad comes to visit me and my mom. To keep things balanced and fair. So this means I have the house to myself every other weekend. So on those weekends I like to invite my close freinds over for drinks and shenanigans. It used to happen pretty often. 

Something I should add, this close group of friends is about 6 people. One friend is in the military service,  so whenever he's home for a few weeks there's always alot of effort to see him. One of the friends is free alot of the time and he has never said no to a meet up. Another friend is a stay at home carer, and does not get alot of times for friends, but when he is able to he will make the time. Another has a hard working Job and a girlfriend that likes seeing him on weekends, but when he has free time, he always shows up for a fun night. And friend number 5 is the youngest, so he gets himself in alot of trouble with his parents. But when hes able to see us, he will always be a good laugh.

But here's what's been bothering me. For multiple weekends now I've been organising get togethers with these friends, then the morning of I always message them to ask what time they're able to make it, if they're still down to meet, etc etc. And that's when almost all of them tell me a reason they can't make it. And I should add; we don't really like 1 to 1 hang outs, we like when at least 3 of us can make it to plans we make. Otherwise we try to reorganise.

Anyway, this has been happening time after time after time. I understand we're not teenagers anymore, we don't have as much free time as we used to. But after this happening so many times in a row, I'm talking 5 or 6 times now, Im starting to realise I'm the only one trying to sort out meet ups. I simply cannot remember the last time someone messaged me to ask to hang. I even scrolled through messages from this year, just to see...just to see if I was just over reacting. But no. 8 times. 8 times between the 5 of them I've been asked to hang out. I understand that doesn't sound too bad. But for context, 4 of those were from one person. My military friend. Because whenever he's home he asks to see me. And I give him the benefit of the doubt when he doesn't ask, because he only takes leave from work in 2 week intervals a few times a year. He has family to catch up with and wants chill time to himself to feel human too.

So with that in mind, I've been nice. I've shrugged it off when people cancel. But when it's multiple weekends in a row...for 2 months..with last minute, what feels like, excuses, you start to feel like you're not wanted. You start to feel like you've done something wrong. 

And I know what people on reddit will say: ""communicate with them"", ""sit them all down and talk to them"". Well I have. Multiple times. And nothing has changed. Jusy multiple apologies.

So today, I caved in. Its currently Saturday. Yesterday, after work I messaged the friend group to see who was free. And once again, everyone who's free is happy to come. And guess what happened this morning. I message the 3 that were coming to see what time they we're free so we could make a time that suited everyone. And once again...3 excuses. One of them is tired after being home from a 14 day holiday abroad. Okay understandable...except hes been home over 5 days now, no way youre still tired/jet lagged. One of them is unable to make it because hes fucking grounded again. I mean okay cool, but youre 22 with a car now, grow tf up. And another friend messages to say he slept really badly last night and is exhausted. Okay cool, welcome to adult life. Get more rest or maybe grab a coffee to recharge and just turn up a little later than planned?

So as I said, I caved. I messaged them all the same message. 

""I understand we're adults, I understand plans change. I understand that we all have our own shit going on. But god damn this has happened over and over again. I can't actually remember the last time we saw each other. And you know what I've noticed, it's still only me asking, after multiple conversations.  Conversations where we all agreed on the issue might I add. So I'm finished. I'm past my limit. You wanna talk to me? You wanna hang out? Good for you. I ain't replying to your once a year fucking message asking to see me. Having close friends that constantly put you off if worse than having none at all. That way there's no disappointment. And don't bother apologising. It means nothing. For once, if you acctually care, show you're sorry instead of just saying it"".

I'm sorry if I sound like an asshole in this post. But when you get canceled on by the same people for what feel like the same damn reasons for so damn long, even legitimate reasons start to sound like excuses.",1,1731764449.0,Rants,0,0.99,False
1gsngvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1gsngvb/need_encouragementinsight_planning_to_opensetup_a/,Need encouragement/insight - Planning to open/setup a small coffee shop or cafe (province),"Hi! (esp. to coffee shop or cafe owners)

As the title says. we've been planning again lately to open/setup a small coffee shop or cafe in our province, but this has been an idea since last year. However, when we are discussing this last year, it's more on excitement but lately is more on anxiety and fear since it's getting more realistic which is we've been setting up already an expectation lately esp. on the possible challenges or issues we'll be encountering.

Anyway, ayun na nga, anytime soon (could be few weeks or months) is mag start na yung extension sa paupahan namin sa province to 2nd floor which is maliit lang but tapat ng school. Yung province is about 2 hours lang away in Manila but not too developed municipality so medyo outdated pa din na ang pinaka commercial lang na meron compared to developed municipality are 7-Eleven, Chooks-To-Go, Andoks, etc. so not even a fast food eh meron and around 35K+ lang population as of 2020.

Background on me is I'm into coffee hobby and I really like the aesthetic ng coffee equipment and therapeutic for me mag brew. I've been using AeroPress and Flair (which I sold already) and I can say na or at least na comparable naman yung lasa na ginagawa kong coffee (iced - e.g. Spanish Latte which is not hard naman to do) sa mga specialty or third-wave cafe (not Starbucks, CBTL, etc.) since I'm using din a decent Arabica beans from well-rated roasters and I have a decent electric grinder (DF64 Gen 2). Actually, nag start yung inspiration from YouTube yung channel na may mga coffee cart sa Thailand who uses Flair (Pro 2 or 58) hence we're also planning to do a slow-bar type using a Flair 58 and AeroPress although I actually changed the idea in using Gemilai but since it's province eh baka mahirapan sa paghanap ng service center na makakapunta agad just in case magka problema sa machine tho having an extra espresso machine is okay din but gusto ko ulit gamitin yung Flair 58 since dun ko naman nakuha yung inspo to begin with and also dahil kay Neighbor Coffee (Iloilo) which is napuntahan ko lately.

I'll put below why we had an excitement before and anxiety/fear lately by using pros/cons and why we want to do it:

Pros:

* It's our own place so minus the rent
* It's front of school (up to senior high school however it's a public school) and it's within main road
* No slow-bar coffee setup yet around the area which is within the ""Bayan"" tho meron na about 650m away

Cons:

* There are already multiple coffee/cafe shop around the area but some eh more on meal & drinks na malapit samin but balak namin is more on drinks lang and little bit of food but there are already have the same setup naman din around the area lang din so we're thinking na a little bit saturated na
* I'm not sure if it's a sign but I've been seeing business owners (esp. cafe or coffee shop) lately na struggling, planning in closing or worst eh closed na so quite worried with the timing given na tumataas bilihin so apektado din buying power ng mga tao lately so ang realistic target namin is at least 6 months na magiging breakeven but could be more or worst is a year or two or mag consider na mag stop
* It won't be easy and wala naman madali but we have full time work din tho WFH but still, di maligning tutok na tutok but manageable naman

Why:

* ""Fail safe"" or a backup to my corporate job considering I was laid-off sometime ago
* Experience so if somehow went successful is I emulate namin siya sa Manila so at least may idea na kami
* We'll involve my retiring parent so somehow eh ito yung magiging retirement niya if gusto niya and siya naman ang boss coming from being an OFW
* Helping someone by giving a job and help him/her (we're planning to hire a working student with same compensation within the market and/or area) on what he/she really want to do after he/she graduates since may experience na kami
* Expansion to roastery since wala pang roastery around the area AFAIK and by helping farmers na din
* etc. and basically it's not really solely for money (tho it's the top priority since need siya to operate the shop) but being a responsible owner by helping or giving some to the community

So ayun para sa additional details if matatanong ako eh ano or sino ba target namin is actually not really the students even if nasa tapat siya ng school kasi I already asked some coffee shop and di daw talaga students esp. the younger ones and normally nag stay sa cafe or coffee shop but those who'll do biking once in a while, mga naka WFH (so it's airconditioned and we'll check the solar panel setup) around the area but we'll have to sound proof yung shop since main road siya and may mga dumadaan na truck and those around the area so it's more on community, third-wave and slow-bar type yung gagawin talaga namin. We'll probably sell some items in the shop like clothes (ukay-ukay) or something once in a while since the floor area (could be less due to exterior) eh about 27sqm.

And what we're planning to do for the meantime is to enroll courses na related sa coffee brewing (to gain more hands-on experience) and business side if there's any. After that, as part of our R&D is to sell within our subdivision/village to get feedback na din.

If nakarating kayo dito, thank you for reading out since mahaba but even if we're quite anxious and having fear lately eh we're still planning to open kasi di naman namin malalaman if di namin masusubukan but just hoping for some advice (good or bad) and encouraging words (if there is or if we have to delay muna given yung timing lately if tama yung feeling ko) or para lang mas prepared kami lalo mentally esp. on the negative sides. We're really totally have zero idea pa with this thing except on brewing but there's still more esp. sa pag setup na government related stuff, supplies, etc. but we're already preparing ourselves or if may mabibigay kayong list what are the critical things to consider or do.

Thank you!",3,1731764371.0,phinvest,2,1.0,False

I have a hard time getting started and get overwhelmed with trying to research because I get bogged down in details... so here's me in a nutshell and what i would like to achieve:

I'm 36, cis woman, overweight, 5'7"" 

What i would like:

Focus on general health: 
in the last year i went through a traumatic event, lost 50lbs, lost a bunch of hair, and my body went through hell. I'm in a much happier and healthier place in life and want to be more intentional with my health. I eat well, don't drink any soda or canned shit, i don't eat out, (once a month or so I'll think ""I want fast food"" and then suffer the consequences of bloating and feeling like shit for a week after) I don't eat sweets or processed snacks. I do need to eat more veggies though. 

My bad habits are: 
i drink too much coffee and not enough water (home brewed, milk, with either stevia, sugar, or a splash of maple syrup) and i skip meals, often times not eating till dinner then eating too much. I would like to lose weight, but it's not a focus. 

Areas of focus: 

Energy: I just don't have any... coffee's not cutting it... i'm so tired and exhausted so often... 

Bloating and inflammation: i struggle with it. And it's in waves. No idea why. My tummy health needs help i think. There are days i look pregnant and then wake up the next morning and all that water weight and bloating are just gone and i look like i lost 15 pounds overnight... help

hair health/growth: (i have nutty professor hair as quite a bit is growing back now, but my hair is thin and frizzy. As a teenager my hair was thick, soft, and straight) skin and nails are okay

Women's health:
Mental health is good, i don't suffer from depression or anything and I am working on processing trauma. My cycles are regular, i don't believe i am premenopausal yet. Lady bits are as they should be. But i struggle with female orgasmic disorder. Things just don't feel like much. It's a shot in the dark but would be nice if that could be improved somehow. 

Any help and direction on anything would be greatly appreciated... ",1,1731763968.0,Supplements,1,1.0,False

1gsn9po,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIRE_Ind/comments/1gsn9po/fire_journey_forced_fire_or_not/,FIRE journey - forced FIRE (or not),"I have been a lurker on this subreddit for a long time and was a lurker on the older subreddit before that. I started my FIRE journey in 2015. Skip to the TLDR at the bottom for a quick summary. However, I hope my FIRE journey is interesting to read.

In 2012, I was having lunch with my team mates and we started discussing on retirement. I was 32 years then (turned 44 this year). We were throwing numbers around and after much discussion, we came to the conclusion that the high level numbers is 4-5 Cr. 3 Cr for retirement and 1 Cr for each child's education/marriage expenses. This was 2012, so we were over budgeting. However, I got to know about this much later.

I started my journey in 2014 as normal SIPs in various mutual funds. At that time some ""free"" financial consultant contacted me and made me do a bunch of SIPs in regular funds. I was naive and very soon I was doing SIPs in more than 30 different mutual funds. I also burned my hands in F&O and lost a good sum there.

2017-18 was when I started investing seriously. I narrowed down the list of funds I was investing into. Moved all regular mutual funds to direct funds and also started doing SIP in some large cap stocks. I was investing around 50% of my income at that time.

In 2022 I engaged a fee-only financial advisor. We went over my numbers and as per his recommendation, I was in line to be financially free in the beginning of 2024. I finished off my home loan in June 2024 and was waiting for the year to end to collect my bonus and drop my resignation. However, fate had other plans. I was laid-off last month with a 2.5 month salary. And now, I am FIRE.

I have not conveyed my plan to ""not-work"" to my parents/siblings/wife. I will mostly tell them that I am looking for a job and not getting one. There are 2 challenges that I saw in the first 15 days of FIRE

* I have a lot of free time and I do not know how to spend it. My friend circle(s) is still busy with their jobs and I kind of miss those coffee-chats in office. As of now, I am engaging in playing video games and catching up on some pending books and web series. But, i can foresee that I will get bored of this soon.
* Most of my friends are shocked when I tell them that I am not planning to work anymore. When I tell them that I got laid off and am not planning to work, I can feel the sympathy in their voice - (feels as if they believe i have lost it). I hope experienced FIREd folks can guide me on how to tackle such situations.

As for my numbers. I am married with 2 kids both in school as of now.

Broadly, I have around 35x of my yearly expenses (including yearly vacation & school fees). I am expecting the next 10 years to be expense heavy as kids would be finishing school and going to college and I plan to travel a bit. After that the expenses should come down with age. I am using a bucket strategy for more detailed yearly planning.

70% of the funds are in equity mutual funds & direct stocks. Remaining 30% of the funds are parked in EPF, PPF, ULIP and debt mutual funds. I have invested in real-estate and hold 2 properties in Delhi-NCR. The real-estate should be worth around 3 Cr now. I have not included this in the above calculation. They are to act as buffer in case of need.

BTW, I have never been abroad for work - not even for a tiny assignment. All my earning are from working in India. With dedication and perseverance and a bit of luck, folks in India can also FIRE.

TLDR; Started my journey in 2014. Currently have around 35x of my annual expenses + real-estate. Got laid off and am not planning to work. All income is from working in India only.",10,1731763724.0,FIRE_Ind,5,1.0,False

My work is dynamic so you won't just get a reading and call it a day. I do detailed reading and give my clients some time to ponder and then give them more readings based on their response. It definitely takes me 3-5 days for one case ( sometimes even more). I give enough material that act as guide. People feel the need to go through my readings second or third time to absorb the message as they are voluminous. 

I am looking for one seeker whose case I can work on for next week. The actual value of readings start at $77 and go upto $222 depending on the seekers needs however I am giving a donation based reading for reasonable amount.

They made many different series, but their most prominent was a hardcore series, which ended with them completing the game. There are a couple details from the series that I can remember:

In I believe the third episode, he enters a cave and ends up with half a heart and no food, which led to a moment where he was repeatedly punching a zombie away from him while saying ""If he hits us, we're dead.""

This episode I also remember opening with him rambling about how he burnt his tongue because he likes ""really hot coffee""

I remember one point in an episode where he looks at his farm, in which he's placed stone slabs over the water trough, and states ""According to people in the comments, this is wrong""

I remember something from an episode late in the hardcore series in which he falls down a large hole into lava while in a cave, and quickly drinks a health potion to heal himself. As he does so, an annotation appeared reading ""I would have died if I didn't have the health pot""

I can recall a bit from a previous series he did with someone else, where they had a brief argument about making iron shovels - ""Do not use the iron to make shovels."" ""Why?"" ""Because it's a waste of the iron."" ""It is not!""

From that same series, I also remember him encountering a bug in which a pig corpse remained on the ground and didn't disappear.

He also did a series with a friend in which they both had a base and attacked eachother somehow? I recall the end of the series had both bases covered in lava.

Last thing I can remember is when his hardcore series concluded, he opened a Minecraft server of his own, and I recall it having players and I joined it myself.

I have reasonable certainty this channel has been straight up deleted at this point by my complete inability to track it down despite remembering a lot of details. Maybe someone knows what I'm talking about? I already tried searching ""Minecraft hardcore"" and limiting the results to only old videos, but no dice.

In his defense he did help me clean the apartment a little bit. I would say most of the move and the stress of moving fell onto me though. This is where the troubles began.

When we moved in he set up an office for himself and refused to help me get furniture and decorate the place. Due to the prior financial struggles we endured, we were on a budget so I furnished the house with Facebook marketplace items. He never seemed to love the place. We really didn't have a ton of money so we stopped going on dates and spending romantic quality time together. While we paid off our debts. This really upset me and I felt he was taking me for granted after a while. Even after we could start affording dates, we didn't go. I have been really upset about this, and I told him as much. 

It's also worth mentioning he makes $1500-$2000 average a week, while I make under $2000 a month. I took this huge paycut to be with him in this new city and I'm also in a job I am overqualified for. So it's worth mentioning, my 50% looks different from his 50% but we are suppose to be splitting things 50/50 financially. I pay the bills, he suppose to pay for groceries and dates. This is important for the context of the story. 

Fast forward, we start making friends and get invited to a friend's birthday. I beg him to go. Finally he caved in because I've been so upset at the lack of effort he's put into our relationship. He views spending time with mutual friends a sacrifice he has to make to be in a relationship with me. 

We get to the party and that's where we meet Michelle. Michelle and my boyfriend hit it off immediately. They have pretty much the same interests, the same hobbies, similar life experiences... They just talked all through dinner while I tried to make friends with the other people there. At the end of dinner, while everyone got up to leave, they stayed back to talk and exchange contact information. At this point I felt something in my gut and just wanted to leave. I felt like if I slipped away he wouldn't even notice I was gone, that's how closely they were talking and how little I had been included. I just had this feeling. It was this knot like something bad was going to happen between the three of us. He was touching her arms, flirting. I tried to push my insecurities aside and be happy he was making new friends. I just couldn't shake this feeling. With that, I offered to help carry my friends gifts and things back to the car. To my surprise my boyfriend noticed and followed me.

Later that night we went to a dance club. Michelle showed up and spoke to my boyfriend briefly after this but the rest of the night I decided I was just insecure for no reason and needed to give Michelle a chance because she seemed like a nice person. 

Fast forward, I find out she invited my boyfriend to a discord server and to a magic the gathering night. I texted her (got the phone number from my boyfriend) to ask if I could be invited, which she did. While I did feel insecure about how fast their friendship was growing. I genuinely wanted to get to know her. I learned how to play magic the gathering and found out I really like the game and I really liked Michelle. I thought she was a good trustworthy person. Meanwhile, my relationships with my boyfriend continued to suffer as he refused to go on dates and spend time with me outside of his hobbies.

Recently, our friend group had another person, someone who was being problematic. Let's call her Bella. I just so happened to be one of Bella's targets. I kept how I felt about what was going on close to my chest for a month before finally opening up to my boyfriend over the phone about it. He ended our call early to call Michelle and tell her everything I told him in confidence. I found out later after the fact when he and I were discussing things. I felt super betrayed. I didn't realize he was calling her to talk on the phone. He claimed this was the first time this happened and that his actions were innocent. I told him it made me uncomfortable and I felt disrespected. When I brought it up to him he agreed we needed to work on things between us and start going on dates again. Which never happened. 

Then, three weeks ago Michelle asked him to watch her dogs. She gave him her house key and they both neglected to tell me about it until I caught him leaving to go to her place one day. He had the house key for several days before she left. He did tell me as he was leaving he was going to her house to watch her dogs when I caught him, but the whole thing rubbed me the wrong way. There was a lot of secrecy around his relationship with her. I told him that I was concerned his relationship with her had evolved into an emotional affair. He insisted it wasn't like that and this was all a big miscommunication. Everything in my gut was telling me something was wrong. That pesky feeling was back. At this point we still had not gone on a date. After I caught him with the key, he finally took me out half heartedly to a bar where we each got a drink, ate toast and went home under 30 minutes without talking much. He called it a date. In hindsight I'm disappointed in how happy I was to just get this sad evening with him. 

Once she returned, he was pushing me to go to the mall with him to shop for presents for people for Christmas. There are two malls in our city. One is smaller than the other. I am not a huge fan of malls so I suggested we just go to the smaller one together to check it out. He wanted to go to the bigger one, so he immediately asked Michelle to go with him. He wanted to spend the day with her at the mall. I was upset. His response was ""she's there to do things with me you don't want to"". This led to fight and I asked him to please treat this outing as casual as possible, no date like or or borderline flirty stuff. He agreed so I felt okay about it. The day of, he wore a nice button down and work pants with boots. He looked like he was going on a date. I explicitly the night before begged him to be casual about this outting with her. He felt, where he is from, people dress up nice to go to the mall and I was being controlling. This lead to a huge fight between us. He won and I apologized. I was in the wrong for telling him how to dress. This still felt to me like he went on a date with her, but I bit my tongue. 

After the mall trip, I told him I was upset so I got my second date. During the date he asked me why I felt so insecure about his and Michelle's relationship, so I told him everything. The moment I met her and saw them together, how I had this gut feeling. He got mad at me, we ended the date fighting and I was feeling guilty. 

A day after we talked, she messaged him asking how he was doing. He asked me if he could tell her his feelings, causing me to feel guilty all over again. I basically told him I trusted him and want him to be truthful. I really do believe honesty is the best policy. I hoped me doing this would show him I do trust him. This might have been a mistake... They spoke on the phone for two hours. He had me leave the room and I respected his wishes because I wanted to show him I trusted him. He told me some of what was said but I'm not sure I believed it anymore. It's worth noting he started trying to show me his phone claiming I was being controlling. I never asked to see his phone and I didn't feel comfortable with him acting like I was accusing them of anything, because I wasn't at that point in time. I just was concerned how fast this friendship evolved over just two months. It made me uncomfortable. I really did trust him though. I just was starting to doubt everything because he words and actions weren't lining up. 

It's also worth noting that during the mall trip she helped him realize he doesn't want to get married. He was able to discuss his divorce with her in a way that helped him realize this apparently. He came home and told me that he didn't want to ever get married after this trip which was a shock and news to me. He felt marriage just strips men of all their money. This honestly broke my heart but I tried to be positive and supportive. I told him he should talk to a therapist to help him with his past trauma. He is strongly against therapy and feels he already graduated it. 

The following day was Michelle's birthday. I was hoping to have a one on one coffee with her after her birthday to talk to her about things but she called my boyfriend telling him she wanted to talk to me at her party. The fact she wasn't texting me directly or calling me made me super uncomfortable. He told her we should talk at the party about things so we could resolve them before her trip. He has this phone call without me there. I would have preferred to wait. 

At the party she avoided us the whole time, which is fair. At the end of the party when there were only a few guests left, I approached her and asked if she was open to talking after the party. She asked me if I wanted to talk then and there... Which I told her, I honestly didn't want to do but I was eager to resolve things. I asked her where she wanted to talk. She asked if I wanted to sit at the dining room table or go somewhere else. The last 4 guests were in the other rooms so I said dining room for privacy. 

During the talk she apologized to me and said she never meant to hurt me or cause me to feel insecure and hurt (I never told her I felt these things). I reassured her she had nothing to apologize to me for and that this was all a miscommunication that I would love to avoid these sort of things in the future. I asked if we could talk more and establish boundaries and work on transparency because I felt it was lacking in our relationships. She said nothing. I asked her if she wanted to share anything or tell me how she is feeling or add any input, she did not. During our talk my boyfriend came into the room and sat at the end of the table to listen. 

Afterwards I thought the conversation went okay enough. Her silence didn't really sit easy with me but I didn't want to read into it. The next day we came over to the house to play magic the gathering. She left early and avoided us like the plague. I honestly was really upset. I had really hoped we resolved things.

The next day while I was at work, my boyfriend called her and they talked on the phone and he spoke to her on our behalf without giving me a heads up. Apparently she thought I was weird and she did not feel the conversation went well. She feels I cornered her and forced her to talk to me in the middle of her party. I took him for pizza that night and he told me about their conversation. He kept trying to show me his phone. I was really uncomfortable. She and my boyfriend proceeded to text the rest of the night because ""she was bored and needed company"". This of course upset me even more and we had a fight. The rest of the week he avoided me. I sent her a text basically reiterating everything I had said and told her I wanted to talk more when she got back but to enjoy her trip. 

Tonight I was a promised a date night. It went well... Or so I thought. It felt like he was actually present and kinda trying at dinner. Afterwards we came home and he said he needed to talk to me. He told me he has feelings for Michelle. He told her and she's known for a while how he feels. I was devistated. He told me he likes her a lot but he is choosing me and that I have nothing to worry about. I thanked him for his honesty and asked him if this meant he would distance himself from her. He said, no. He wants to spend more time with her and would be picking her up from the airport in the next few days. He was willing to work on things though. When I asked him what he meant by that, he said he would stay with me and not have sex with her despite my insecurities. All he needed was for me to trust him. I was floored. Is this what he meant by ""we will work on things""? WTH!?!?!  I asked him to clarify what behavior he was going to change to get our relationship to work, and he verified none. He doesn't see what he did wrong. This for me was the last straw. I broke up with him. I'm at a friend's house now trying to figure out what to do, especially with the holidays upon us. We were suppose to host my family, I'm not sure I can find a place in time to host everyone. 

My now ex boyfriend thinks I'm being jealous and insecure because his new best friend is a girl, he has feelings for her and isn't willing to distance himself to work on our failing relationship. He doesn't see anything wrong with developing feelings for her and not having boundaries. He can't understand why I'm upset and why I can't trust him. I honestly feel justified due to communicating at length how I wanted him to start working on our relationship, prioritizing me as much as he is her. Lastly, asking him to ease up on his fast growing relationship with Michelle for a bit untill we figured ourselves out and he got therapy for managing his relationships and his past traumas. 

Again I don't hate Michelle or think she is bad. I think she looks bad right now due to what he has said to me. I feel like there is more that I'm not seeing or understanding in this. I'm trying to give her the benefit of the doubt till she comes home and we can talk. I hate this situation and I feel like my relationship ended before my eyes in smoke and mirrors with Michelle at the center. I honestly can't tell up from down or left from right in this relationship anymore. I honestly don't know what to do. Even writing this out I wonder if I could have handled this differently.

It was something along the lines of keeping most of your wealth in BTC indefinitely instead of a savings account, and only converting to fiat if you need to pay a bill or go on vacation etc.

Then he said something like:

In Dollar terms the cost of the coffee beans he buys have become 45% more expensive in the last 5 years.

In BTC terms they are 85% cheaper than 5 years ago.

First date, we went out for coffee and talked for 2-3 hours. Lots of enthusiasm and we agreed to meet again, there was a constant ongoing text conversation for the next week until we were both available for another date. Met for dinner and afterwards went for a walk around a park, similarly ended up talking for a few hours and it went great. We immediately set up a 3rd date for 2 days later and continued to text with a lot of enthusiasm. 3rd date took place at my house where we watched a movie, and then we ended up listening to music and making out for ~30 minutes. We were both very obviously into it, but at the end she was embarrassed because she left a very noticeable wet spot on my pants (she was on top of me wearing a skirt, and she explicitly said I had made her wet and apologized). I told her it was nothing to be embarrassed by and we kind of laughed it off after I changed pants, but I don't know if it maybe actually bothered her for some reason? I dropped her off at her apartment and we kissed again, which felt like we were ending on a good note because it was really prolonged and she initiated it.

But pretty much immediately after that, the energy was just gone. I texted her when I got back home just saying I had a nice time and all that, and she did immediately respond. But her texts from that point were noticeably different in tone. Very short and lots of emoji, which she hadn't used before. We texted a little the next day and it was about the same, except hours between each text. No goodnight text or anything as we had shared every night since probably the 2nd date. I decided not to immediately text her the next day as I thought she might just want some space or something. Waited until the end of the day and just sent her a simple text asking how her day was, but I got no response. As of now, still haven't (this is the day after that).

I'm just feeling confused and bummed out. Everything was going so well up to this point, and I'm not really sure why the enthusiasm died. I never get physical with someone unless I genuinely like them and it feels like it's leading somewhere. The fact the energy shifted so hard after what was seemingly a great date makes no sense to me.",4,1731762162.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False
1gsmszb,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1gsmszb/almost_24h_in/,Almost 24h in,"So I've been a user of nicotine pouches for a couple years, working my way up to about 10 pouches or half a can per day at 6mg.  Not the first time I've tried quitting, so I'm gonna try to write about the process in hopes that it helps.  The pros and cons of quitting as I see them so far as well as some tips:

  
Pros:

* heart rate down - my resting heart rate went down 5bpm within like 5h of not having another pouch and seemingly stayed down throughout the night
* heart rate variability up - my HRV is up this morning
* loosening body tension - although my brain feels foggy, I swear I can feel my body overall like loosening some tension; I don't know exactly what to call it but it seems like an overall positive change
* sinuses seem a little clearer than usual
* increased general motivation - I haven't quite experienced this yet after just 24h, but I remember from previous quitting attempts and I think it will come in time: when I'm not using nicotine, I have a generally higher motivation to do shit in life.  Even if the moment-to-moment motivation might be lower at times, there's a brightness to all of life that seems like it gets dulled when I'm using nicotine pouches.
* less shame - maybe it's a person-by-person thing, but I personally do feel some shame in the overall habit.  Buying cans of pouches constantly.  Having friends see you constantly throw a pouch in, etc.  So not having to use feels like a letting go of that.
* better gum health - also a longer-term supposed benefit but this should stop the negative affects on my gums from using pouches



Cons:

* pleasureful sensation - the most obvious one, but I miss the pleasure that comes from using pouches.  It may be short lived but holy FUCK it is good.
* lack of foucs - it's harder for me to focus especially within these first 24h.  Work tasks felt impossible yesterday and thank god I started right before a weekend because this would be hard as hell to start during the week.
* increased anxiety - I feel a bit more on edge right now to be honest; hoping that will go away but I get the sense it could take a while
* loss of excitement - there's a certain sense or feeling of being ""bad"" that I kinda liked with throwing in these pouches.  I suppose this is the opposite point to the shame point above, but there is a certain relief that comes with saying ""fuck it"" and throwing in a pouch.
* difficult trigger moments - this could be just intense cravings or an activity that used to trigger me to want to throw in a pouch.  Big ones for me included after meal, after exercise, first thing with coffee, etc.

  
Overall I think a lot of the cons are really just because I've only ""quit"" for 24h so far.  But I'm hopeful that many of those will go away.  Just in these first 24h, I can already probably mention some things that were super helpful for me:

Tips:

* Chew gum - or use a toothpick or something to keep your mouth busy
* Timing the quit - Try to start on the Friday before a weekend (long weekend if possible) so you don't have to deal with the tough first days of the quit and get hit with stress of work at the same time
* Remember the strongest reasons - for me that's better overall health, better gum health, more overall enjoyment of daily life, and reduced reliance on having a substance constantly.  This has been insanely helpful during the worst cravings
* Make it hard to get - Don't keep cans home.  If you have leftover when you try to quit, throw em out",1,1731762157.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False

1gsmqb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gsmqb8/aita_for_being_that_guy/,AITA for being THAT GUY,"So, here’s the thing. It all started last Thursday. Or maybe it was Wednesday? Anyway, I was at this coffee shop—the one with the chairs that make your back hurt but your ego feel superior, you know? I ordered a cappuccino, but the barista (let’s call him Kyle) gave me a flat white instead. Classic Kyle. I wasn’t about to make a scene; I’m not a monster. But I thought, ""Do I say something? Do I not? What would Oprah do?""

I decided to let it go because life is short, and caffeine is caffeine. But THEN, I overheard the woman behind me, who looked like she just stepped out of a Hallmark movie, asking for soy milk, and Kyle gives her almond. Almond! Not even close. She didn’t notice, but I did. And that’s when I realized something was off. A conspiracy, maybe?

Fast forward two hours later (yes, I stayed), and Kyle’s still messing up orders. A latte with no foam? Foam everywhere. Decaf? Full throttle. People left grumbling, but nobody said a word. Sheep. All of them. I decided to take matters into my own hands.

I got back in line and asked for a macchiato. A bold move, I know. Kyle froze. His hands trembled. “Uh, we don’t serve those,” he stammered. Excuse me? A coffee shop with no macchiato? That’s like a library with no books. I pointed to the menu, and sure enough, it was listed—right there between the mocha and chai latte.

Kyle’s manager appeared (let’s call her Sharon). Sharon asked if there was a problem, so I calmly explained the macchiato debacle. Sharon sighed like this was her thousandth battle of the day, and then Kyle mumbled something about being new. “We’ll fix it,” Sharon said, glaring at Kyle like he’d personally insulted her family.

I got my macchiato, took a sip, and—plot twist—it was amazing. Best macchiato I’ve ever had. But here’s the kicker: I don’t even like macchiatos.

So AITA for exposing Kyle’s coffee crimes?

Oh, who am I kidding? This story was absolute nonsense. No meaning, no point—just like that macchiato. Hope you had a good laugh though and don't hate me for wasting your time😉

1gsmofk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeePH/comments/1gsmofk/need_encouragementinsight_planning_to_opensetup_a/,Need encouragement/insight - Planning to open/setup a small coffee shop or cafe (province),"Hi! (esp. to coffee shop or cafe owners)

As the title says. we've been planning again lately to open/setup a small coffee shop or cafe in our province, but this has been an idea since last year. However, when we are discussing this last year, it's more on excitement but lately is more on anxiety and fear since it's getting more realistic which is we've been setting up already an expectation lately esp. on the possible challenges or issues we'll be encountering.

Anyway, ayun na nga, anytime soon (could be few weeks or months) is mag start na yung extension sa paupahan namin sa province to 2nd floor which is maliit lang but tapat ng school. Yung province is about 2 hours lang away in Manila but not too developed municipality so medyo outdated pa din na ang pinaka commercial lang na meron compared to developed municipality are 7-Eleven, Chooks-To-Go, Andoks, etc. so not even a fast food eh meron and around 35K+ lang population as of 2020.

Background on me is I'm into coffee hobby and I really like the aesthetic ng coffee equipment and therapeutic for me mag brew. I've been using AeroPress and Flair (which I sold already) and I can say na or at least na comparable naman yung lasa na ginagawa kong coffee (iced - e.g. Spanish Latte which is not hard naman to do) sa mga specialty or third-wave cafe (not Starbucks, CBTL, etc.) since I'm using din a decent Arabica beans from well-rated roasters and I have a decent electric grinder (DF64 Gen 2). Actually, nag start yung inspiration from YouTube yung channel na may mga coffee cart sa Thailand who uses Flair (Pro 2 or 58) hence we're also planning to do a slow-bar type using a Flair 58 and AeroPress although I actually changed the idea in using Gemilai but since it's province eh baka mahirapan sa paghanap ng service center na makakapunta agad just in case magka problema sa machine tho having an extra espresso machine is okay din but gusto ko ulit gamitin yung Flair 58 since dun ko naman nakuha yung inspo to begin with and also dahil kay Neighbor Coffee (Iloilo) which is napuntahan ko lately.

I'll put below why we had an excitement before and anxiety/fear lately by using pros/cons and why we want to do it:

Pros:

* It's our own place so minus the rent
* It's front of school (up to senior high school however it's a public school) and it's within main road
* No slow-bar coffee setup yet around the area which is within the ""Bayan"" tho meron na about 650m away

Cons:

* There are already multiple coffee/cafe shop around the area but some eh more on meal & drinks na malapit samin but balak namin is more on drinks lang and little bit of food but there are already have the same setup naman din around the area lang din so we're thinking na a little bit saturated na
* I'm not sure if it's a sign but I've been seeing business owners (esp. cafe or coffee shop) lately na struggling, planning in closing or worst eh closed na so quite worried with the timing given na tumataas bilihin so apektado din buying power ng mga tao lately so ang realistic target namin is at least 6 months na magiging breakeven but could be more or worst is a year or two or mag consider na mag stop
* It won't be easy and wala naman madali but we have full time work din tho WFH but still, di maligning tutok na tutok but manageable naman

Why:

* ""Fail safe"" or a backup to my corporate job considering I was laid-off sometime ago
* Experience so if somehow went successful is I emulate namin siya sa Manila so at least may idea na kami
* We'll involve my retiring parent so somehow eh ito yung magiging retirement niya if gusto niya and siya naman ang boss coming from being an OFW
* Helping someone by giving a job and help him/her (we're planning to hire a working student with same compensation within the market and/or area) on what he/she really want to do after he/she graduates since may experience na kami
* Expansion to roastery since wala pang roastery around the area AFAIK and by helping farmers na din
* etc. and basically it's not really solely for money (tho it's the top priority since need siya to operate the shop) but being a responsible owner by helping or giving some to the community

So ayun para sa additional details if matatanong ako eh ano or sino ba target namin is actually not really the students even if nasa tapat siya ng school kasi I already asked some coffee shop and di daw talaga students esp. the younger ones and normally nag stay sa cafe or coffee shop but those who'll do biking once in a while, mga naka WFH (so it's airconditioned and we'll check the solar panel setup) around the area but we'll have to sound proof yung shop since main road siya and may mga dumadaan na truck and those around the area so it's more on community, third-wave and slow-bar type yung gagawin talaga namin. We'll probably sell some items in the shop like clothes (ukay-ukay) or something once in a while since the floor area (could be less due to exterior) eh about 27sqm.

And what we're planning to do for the meantime is to enroll courses na related sa coffee brewing (to gain more hands-on experience) and business side if there's any. After that, as part of our R&D is to sell within our subdivision/village to get feedback na din.

If nakarating kayo dito, thank you for reading out since mahaba but even if we're quite anxious and having fear lately eh we're still planning to open kasi di naman namin malalaman if di namin masusubukan but just hoping for some advice (good or bad) and encouraging words (if there is or if we have to delay muna given yung timing lately if tama yung feeling ko) or para lang mas prepared kami lalo mentally esp. on the negative sides. We're really totally have zero idea pa with this thing except on brewing but there's still more esp. sa pag setup na government related stuff, supplies, etc. but we're already preparing ourselves or if may mabibigay kayong list what are the critical things to consider or do.

Because I am only used to standard coffee and never really went into detail about it, my knowledge ist very limited and I have some questions about it.

Is Espresso made from the same beans as regular coffee? And if yes what sets it apart? If I bought an Espresso machine, could I also make regular coffee for my friends and family (they don't really like espresso)? What additional Equipment apart from the Espresso machine is needed?

Remember Cafe Coffee Day (CCD), the omnipresent coffee chain?

In 2019, CCD's parent company, CDEL faced a major scandal when SEBI found a massive ₹3,500 crore mismanagement in its accounting books. And recently, the company's auditors from that time got hit with big penalties, including a ban from conducting further audits.

And turns out, the CEO of Embassy REIT was one of the auditors for CDEL, which is why SEBI is after him too.

**2/ Is Ireland’s economic success sustainable?**

The Republic of Ireland has more money than it spends—a situation quite rare for many countries, who often rely on debt to meet their expenditures.

At first glance, the economic conditions in Ireland seem ideal. However the catch is that a large chunk of its tax revenues, jobs, and other services are dependent heavily on multinational companies that have established their headquarters in Ireland.

And this reliance heavily distorts the shining growth figures and high per capita GDP for Ireland. Curious to know how?

Check out our [Tuesday newsletter](https://openinapp.link/w0h7g) for a full breakdown on the fundamental issues facing the Republic of Ireland.

**3/ China's hidden problem**

China’s back with more extreme economic measures to prop up the economy.

It's announced a $1.4 trillion debt package to help local governments. And this debt package will enable local governments to swap risky off-the-books debt for official, government-backed municipal bonds.

But will this fix the underlying issue China's hoping for, or is it just papering over the cracks?

Check out our [Wednesday story](https://openinapp.link/lzq4c) for the answers and an in-depth analysis of China’s hidden debt crisis.

**4/ Why are Indian lakes drying up?**

Do you know that freshwater lakes hold 90% of Earth’s liquid potable water? Yes! and that's why lakes have an important role to play in our daily lives.

But over 50% of the world’s largest lakes are drying up, and in India, over 30 major lakes have seen a similar trend from 1992 to 2020.

So, what’s causing this? And what are we doing to preserve them?

Find it all in our [Thursday's story](https://openinapp.link/lvs9n).

**5/ Will Trump take Bitcoin to the moon?**

In 2019, Donald Trump outrightly dismissed Bitcoin. But today, he's determined to turn the U.S. into the 'crypto capital of the planet'.

And his most eye-catching promise? Developing a U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve.

You sure might be intrigued to know what the heck that is and if Bitcoin's going to keep rallying under Trump’s reign.

My panel is as follows:

•	⁠testosterone 16.58 nmol/l
•	⁠free testosterone 28.1 pg/ml
•	⁠SHBG 23.8 nmol/l
•	⁠estradiol 39 pmol/l

•	⁠FSH 5.3 mIU/ml

I am 28, 177 cm tall and 75 kilos. I am Kazakh, I have normal testies - no problem with that.

I struggled with low self esteem and depression. I was bullied both at school and university. I’ve had persistent subcutaneous fat around my waste and pecs (looks like gynecomastia, but it’s just fat) for all my 20s. Still despite my workouts for more than a year, I my muscles grew very mildly, though I was on calorie deficit and wasn’t living up to 2 g/kilo protein per day.

Also, I have been masturbating mostly almost everyday for all my twenties and I haven’t had morning erection for years too.

Throughout my youth, I haven’t been able to live like a guy, to enjoy all the perks of a young guy - friends, going out, sex, etc. I basically had 0 social life and mostly spent time alone, cause I wasn’t feeling masculine enough and was envious of other guys with pecs, abs, just normal physique. Realization of that pushed me further to having frequent depressive episodes. I would cry in a bed at night thinking about how miserable I am, that I go out all by myself to have coffee, that I don’t have a group of friends to hangout with.

I grew up with no male friends and I haven’t been taught to properly defend myself both physically and verbally. My father didn’t participate in my upbringing. We wouldn’t spend quality time with me, asking questions about my teen years, about my preferences, just to know more about his own son. I am the middle one of 3 boys. My brother is 6.5 yrs older and I am 3.5 years older than my little brother. We haven’t really grew to be close siblings. Neither my brother nor my little brother respect me or take me seriously. I essentially cut ties with them, it’s been a year now.

Since my childhood I was interested in boys, not so much in girls. I also wanted to be like some of them: to have muscles, be handsome, have friends, go out, not to be afraid of who I am, to express your opinion clearly, etc. I started dating men and engaging in homosexual relationships after a lockdown in 2020. I only dated once for 6 month or smth and it ended terribly - we were just using each other to satisfy our attachment traumas.

I had few partners with lean body and I feel inferior by their side - I want to have a beautiful body too. That ruins my self-esteem and the relationship.

I am 28 now and basically I am broke. I graduated the most prestigious university in my country, but money wise and just from the stand point of building your life - I wasn’t able to do that. All because of I wasn’t confident and energetic enough. I didn’t have enough drive. The traumas of bullying, the years of public humiliation left me miserable. I mean… I have the same limbs, the same skin, hairs, same body parts, but somehow I am inferior to them.

The irony is that my father actually is a urologist. The same medical expert who knows all about sex hormones. He never talked to me about that and he never ever briefed me on male health, that my testosterone levels should be in that or this range. Never. Never was interested in my life or anything. He goes to his work and comes home - that’s all.

I was typing this and accidentally deleted a big chunk of thoughts and had to re write most of it, but now I kinda lost the momentum.

Long story short, I’ve started this Monday taking boron (6 mg), tongkat Ali (400 mg), fadogia agrestis (600 mg), shilajit extract (125 mg). I felt some mild pressure and discomfort in my testicles for few days, but it seems okay now. I am planning to cycle it 3 weeks on and 1 off.

I am at my wits end with how mornings go in my house and I need some help.

My kids (3 of them; 5 & under)wake up ornery and miserable every single day, and our mornings are a disaster.

They are instantly crying, upset, fighting with eachother, screaming…it’s literally so stressful. It’s like they wake up in a horrible mood and I cannot avoid it for the life of me.

What I’ve tried: getting up before them to give myself a minute to get “with it” (aka coffee) before dealing with them. However, I typically don’t have much time before they are up. They are early risers, up every morning between 530 and six. (They sleep through the night, they are just low sleep needs. There’s absolutely nothing I can do about this wake up time. I’ve tried everything under the sun to get them to sleep later thinking maybe they’re still just tired, but it’s not happening.) 

I have breakfast ready- typically eggs, pancakes, fruit, sausage. I put it out on our coffee table family style so they can just graze and I don’t have to ask them questions/have them make decisions . So I have food out pretty much immediately thinking it might be a hangry thing. I keep the lighting dim, I don’t really say anything or ask a bunch of questions and just try to give them a minute to wake up in silence. But no matter what, they are SO emotional and upset about everything. 

Our entire house is in fight or flight before the sun even comes up almost every single day. I try my best to regulate myself, and most of the time I can, but it’s a horrible start to all of our days and I just don’t know what to do about it anymore.

important to note: this is NOT in line with their typical personalities. They are happy, well adjusted children at every other time of the day and evening. It’s just mornings that are hard. They all have age appropriate communication skills. Very limited screen time, tons of outside time/learning opportunities during the day… If that’s relevant at all. Idk. 

Does anyone have kids like this, where they just wake up miserable. Does anything help? Please share any advice or experiences. Thanks so much ",2,1731760623.0,Parenting,13,0.75,False

I appreciate all she's done and she's helped me understand what it feels like to have someone support and be there for you.

**Too independent or emotionally numb or just very healthy**

After the work situ and breakup, I realised that everyone was relying on me whilst putting me down making me feel as if I needed them more than they needed me. It's the same with my family, they still try to make situations where I need them and then are guilt tripped about it, when in fact I'm the one supporting them by choice.

It's made me really think and wonder if my new lack of need of people is because I'm avoiding all the pain, or if I've actually just come out of the other side being way stronger, healthier, and more independent. I don't feel as stressed as I used to feel, I don't have that anxiety of people not liking me, I'm setting boundaries for what I accept and don't. I'm here for anyone that needs me but I won't overdo it. I feel very stable mentally but my family's lack of emotional support and this friend makes me question if maybe this new stronger and consciously independent me is not healthy.

I see all the women around me, and it feels like...most of them are needy, lacking a better word, and require the men to look after them but are also demeaning to their men. I know this can't be the norm, but I don't feel like I know any woman in real life that is positive and healthily independent (with or without a partner).

Lately, increasingly, every time I've met that friend, it's felt like she's trying to draw out drama from me. We went out for dinner yesterday and a few things really made me question if we're at very different points in our lives maybe and we're not going to get along currently.

**Dating:**

I did try online dating for a few months, and it's felt me uninterested and sad about how people date nowadays unfortunately. However every time I express that I'm off the apps and not going to try dating for now because I'm not 100% ready from the breakup, and also online dating isn't working for me for numerous reasons, she's pushed that I need to get out there and every time I'll explain my position.

Yesterday, I said that for the first time since the breakup, I found someone physically attractive. The girls asked if I was going to ask him out for coffee, I explained that I have his work number so it'll be inappropriate and also I currently want to focus on myself hence I have no time/don't want to date. I was simply happy that I was finding someone physically attractive.

She then asked if I would go on a date with him if he asked me out, which I said yes. She then expressed she was 'annoyed' and continued that she doesn't like it when people only want the other person to ask them out but not make the move first. Firstly I've actually always been the pursuer/make the first move, but currently I honestly do not feel ready to date and I have no time, my health is my first priority currently, I also continued to explain that any spare time I have, I am using it for myself, but if someone wants my time, I feel honoured they want my company so of course I'll reciprocate, not just for dating but also friends and family. I am not focused on my social life currently. Our other friend understood and also chimed in supporting me explaining to her that I'm not not dating because of fear but from a healthy space, which finally stopped the conversation.

It's really upset me, because it's happened  every time we've met that I'm being pushed to date, and I'm tired of explaining how I'm not in the right space or period of my life to date. It's also annoyed me that she was talking about her period and how much pain she was going through so called her boyfriend to come home, buy her painkillers, and look after her. I didn't say anything but to me, it sounds wild to ask your partner to leave work to buy you painkillers and look after you for your monthly period, you know you've got terrible period symptoms, stock up on everything you need, track your period so you know when it'll come.

**Family drama:**

I have issues with my family and she knows. I'm currently in a situation where various members of the family rely on me for various things. For example, my dad has been in hospital for over a month and I'm the one being in the hospital with him. She's constantly messaging asking me about my dad, and I'll tell her it's all fine (which is all basically is), but she'll keep asking phrasing it 'if you need to vent, we're always here.'. I've explained to her I know they're here for me and if I need anything I'll reach out. It's tiring updating everyone about my dad, it's time consuming and mentally draining to reassure everyone and my dad that the situation is chilled/ under control.

Yesterday I gave a few more details about my dad and expressed lightly a few things that were ridiculous to me about my family's behaviour, but again reiterated that it's all fine. She tried to ask me how I felt again, and I explained again I'm fine, I don't care really about the drama, she then said that she just doesn't want me to feel annoyed or frustrated about my family, to which I said again I don't care about what's happening, I'm doing what I need to do and feel nothing about my family's behaviour. Our other friend helped me out again and expressed it better, that it doesn't matter because the most important thing is just making sure my dad is okay which he is and that I am not doing what I don't need to do. The drama being kicked up doesn't matter.

Her saying she just doesn't want me to be annoyed or frustrated about my family, combined with the constant asking if I'm okay or need to vent, and contrasting her behaviour to our other friend, it seems to confirm to me that she's not trying to support me. I've explained so many times to her how I'm feeling and what I need, but it feels like I get interrogated or questioned for why I'm being healthy currently.

**Feels like being a woman with 'no' issues or just powering through by themselves is not allowed**  
I can't figure out if being a woman and being okay is just weird nowadays. I've worked hard to achieve peace, and I feel at peace. I don't want drama, I feel too old for drama. Why can't people be happy I'm trying to improve my life? Anyone understand?",0,1731760403.0,AskWomenOver30,5,0.44,False

So basically I was close to these girls ever since 3rd grade. They weren't in the best financial situation, so I always let them borrow things from me, even keep them. We sort of separated in 5th but we were always quite close. Keep in mind that in my school it's just 1-9 graded and then high school. In 6th she and this other girl were kicked out of class (PE) because they were talking too much, and when the other went to change the oldest of the the three girls that I was close to stole my phone (my backpack was open). She left the mask. I found out it was missing because I wanted to message my mother that I'd be staying after school for biology after class. At bio she asked to sit with me but I didn't think much of it, it was definitely to manipulate me. So at my motherlanguage class i realised it was gone and my teacher let me look for it. I was naive (I now have severe trust issues but I haven't told anyone yet). I defended them. I said exactly this: ""They're nice, I doubt they would do something like that"" and ""Why would anyone steal a phone? I think I lost it somewhere, but couldn't they just return it?"" I said that multiple times. Not crying but shaking (I was always unable to cry unless it was incredibly serious). Class ended and the girls saw my father in the school, my sister called him to ask if it was at home so he came because it wasn't. After my homeroom teacher at the time called it multiple times (it wasn't answering because she took the SIM card, the question is how she knew that? She's a horrible student but therefore is prepared to steal), the girls got scared and returned it, saying they found it in the park below our school even tho I wasn't outside with it, I came to school with the car. Two days after she admits it, and I'm pressured into forgiving her. God knows how many times I cried without anyone knowing, feeling it wa unjust. I was a kid back then. I'm still a kid, but i was just 11 at the time. Okay, I don't talk to her at all but whatever. I don't go to any trips because of her, as a sort of protest. Keep in mind my parents were a full support to me. Anyways, 7th grade (I'm 13 now) and the fury inside of me just grows and grows. I'm in puberty and everything upsets me, especially shit like this. PE, again ofc, and I forgot to mention but we were a really big class and they split us, my teacher is different now and doesn't know what happened. The one that stole my phone is in the other class. Ill just refer to the oldest as Joanne, the second youngest as Elly and the third youngest as Eliza from now on. So elly and Eliza scratch the hell out of my hands and claim I insulted them. They also scratched another girls hand and said it was just to get the ball from me, as we were playing basketball. The teacher as always wasn't there so he didn't see anything (drinking coffee on his phone). He just says ""you'll always get hurt on PE""... Anyways, she tells my teacher before I can tell on them. Teach keeps it in mind, but then ? They make a fake account of me on Snap and claim I said horrible shit to them, but my name and insults were written wrong so they knew it wasn't me (I'm a top student, I know how to write). They admit it was them after two days and get punished and... then they become hijabis
...
I'm not trying to critize islam, I am Muslim, but holy fuck? that's not what a real Muslim would do? the terrorists that kill kids are definitely not Muslims but that's not related, what the actual fuck
Then the bullying continues but I tell no one. Why?
I'm scared. I'm so scared. I'm scared they'll kill me. They have the guts. They're not scared of anything. Their sister stole money by saying her child was sick and then her husband, who's also her relative, stabs the fuck out of her, nearly killing her (some guy reported them for stealing). They had three kids, two were taken and then the third, who witnessed all of that... poor thing. I genuinely feel bad for him. He's only just 6. Not even going to school. Anyways, I lash out at them and say she can't spell our schools name because she kept telling me ""O.K."" whenever I DID something. I instantly regretted it. Then there was some random ass water on her table next period and she blamed it on me. Water? Whys that such a big deal? I was swishing my water bottle but even if I did do it holy fuck I wouldn't do it on purpose. Damn, I'm shaking as I write this. If it did spill I'm sorry and I regret it? I'm genuinely so scared she'll kill me or someone else close to me or my sweet homeroom teacher. Please help. I want to cry. I'm crying rn idk what to do I'm just 13. I only just turned 13 ten days ago. I'm so scared and distressed. I try my best and this is what I get in return. Everyone cares about the bad students but not about the good ones.

Turned out one of our housemates was a thief who was stealing money and food from other tenants for years, while her friend covered her up. They pushed the blame on new neighbors after getting friendly with them. Me and my bf recognized the thief right away due to multiple red flags, so she and her bestie weren't able to pull the same trick with us. We eventually exposed the thief and kicked her out of the house, but the thief's friend was allowed to stay. This friend acts like a total douche to us, but no one but me feels that it's wrong to keep her around and treat her as if nothing happened. I feel morally gaslit and torn apart, as other neighbors 'moved on' with her and try to shame me for not doing the same.  
\_

So me and my bf moved to the big house to rent a room in May. At the time the house had 8 other neighbors and a really dark history, but of course nobody told us about it when we walked in. All we saw at first was a really big house, cheap rent, and friendly smiley neighbors. **The first two faces I saw were (the names are fake) Addy’s and Ratty’s.** Addy had a child and a lover living in her room without ever coming out (let’s call her hikku lover Stacey). And Ratty was her closest friend that believed everything Addy said and acted however Addy told her to. **All I knew about these two from the beginning, that they were the oldest inhabitants of that house and basically considered it their own territory. I also knew that different tenants came and went but Raddy duo told me it was normal,** i.e. ‘*well they just moved out cos rent was so high/they got tired of living in one place*’ etc. I found it pretty sus as neighbors indeed moved pretty quick, but those two were pretty good at babbling so I brushed it off. Aside from Addy, Ratty and Stacey, the house had five other neighbors but they weren’t that chatty with me and my bf when we just moved. As they told me later, they weren’t sure of whether we’d keep the hidden information about Addy in secret so we wouldn’t ruin their plan to finally get her out from the house, and that’s why they stayed silent. But the truth is, that **I started seeing red flags in Addy a few days after me moved to our room already**. Here’s what happened.

At first, I noticed how Addy started regularly knocking at our door and when opened, she literally squeezed herself inside and searched the whole room with her eyes rapidly while asking us about something. What did she ask about? ‘*Ohh guys, we have to pay that one bill urgently but I forgot where my card was! Can you share some cash with me*?’ While staying. In our. Room and glazing. Of course we always patiently declined her requests as we both found it quite weird. She also tried to borrow some money for whatever thing she had in mind, pretty often, but then one of our neighbors (let’s call her Elle) whispered to us that Addy never gives any borrowed money back. **Me and my bf decided to look deeper into all of that weird issues and searched the whole chat we were invited to after moving to the house. And oh boy what did we find!** Either Addy and Ratty were really that self-confident or just dumb, but they didn’t delete anything that was ever written to the chat. And the chat included: **1)** several ‘older’ neighbors complaining of their money, food and coffee being stolen; **2)** one of the victim was really friendly with Addy and invited her to his room where he accidentally showed her where his money was, but when he tried to bring it up in the chat during the discussion on who the thief might be, Ratty started cussing him out for ‘being rude’ to Addy and the poor guy was basically silenced; **3)** nobody closed the doors at that time so money was gone from multiple people. Guess who wasn’t affected? Addy, Stacey and Ratty. This thievery caused victims to move, and after me and my bf contacted them via Telegram, they admitted that they left due to thieves living in the house. **And when we learnt this story, we noticed how our things started disappearing too (our toothpaste, detergent and soap). Elle and other neighbors also pointed out in the chat that the food got stolen from them.** So the thieves are still here and aren’t even trying to hide?!

Now we’re in shock! We’re reaching out to Elle and our ‘silent’ neighbors and realize that they knew everything too. **Long story short**: they know that Addy is a thief who’s still unpunished, and Ratty is basically covering her up for several years straight. Apparently the victim neighbors were too traumatized to do anything about her or get the evidence of her thievery and they just preferred to leave. But Ellie and her bf wanted to actually catch Addy. It turned out that they managed to put a camera in the kitchen and catch Addy stealing food from them, but they wanted to also catch her stealing money to report her to the police. During that time Addy started to suspect that we know her dirty secret, so she and Ratty started acting really aggressive towards me, because I’m much worse at handling my emotions than my bf and my face basically said ‘*You awful b\*tches*!’ every time they were around me. **She didn’t know about the camera but knew I'm suspecting her, so she created the 'genius’ plan. She wanted to shove all the stolen food on me and my bf as if we were the thieves and make us move out. So she and Ratty started spreading the rumours about me which were of course dismissed by the footage later lol. What’s important, is that Ratty was on her side ALL THE TIME and tried to pressure me for the things I didn’t do.** It all caused me so much stress that I wanted to move the hell out, so Elle decided to make the footage public sooner.

So. **The thief got exposed.** It was hilarious and horrible at the same time. Stacey turned out not to know a single thing about it (as she said…) so they broke up immediately and Stacey moved out. Elle and the other neighbors also said to Addy that she has to leave within one month otherwise Elle would call a police on her. Addy left soon thank god. **But what of Ratty, her little Bonnie in crime? When she learnt that her besitie indeed was a thief, she cried. Because her bestie got exposed!!** She was soo sad about it. She also wanted to move out from the house because… she hated us who exposed her boo lol. And we cheered, no more rats in the house! …Oh well. She decided to stay. Because the rent in other houses was too high lol. And to tell you even more, she kept acting arrogant and haughty to us. As if we were the bad guys and she was the victim, not the other way around. I was shocked. I’ve never seen such disgusting and vile human being in my life. I wanted her gone too. This lady literally spread rumors about me in order to kick me out and cover her thief friend as she did for years! **But y’know what Elle & the others said?**

She said: ‘*\[OP\], I’m so tired of this rat hunting. Can we just live in peace please? Ratty is paying her rent and she didn’t steal anything. Yuh she’s pretty nasty but you can just treat her as a neighbor or nothing else. Plus, you weren’t even stolen money, so what’s your issue?*’ I couldn’t believe it. My whole morale was literally screaming ‘WHAT. THE HELL!’ Yeah, she wasn’t the DIRECT thief. But she supported the thief, even after exposure. She talked so much shit about me and my bf. She’s freaking disgusting, every time I look at her smug face I wanted to puke. While I was trying to explain it to Elle, she got irritated by me: ‘*Why can’t you just bury the hatchet? This story is in the past, and the thief’s gone. Just accept it*’.

Months have passed since then, and everyone now treats Ratty like a regular human being. She NEVER accepted her fault and she kept acting arrogant (she didn’t even clean her part of the house or wash her dishes, but no one cares about it or treats her any differently). But I never forgot anything, and I still feel so much rage when I see her mug. So you can act like a total douche but you still experience no consequences? Is this how ‘adult world’ really works? My morale doesn’t and will never accept such a scenario. Please tell me if I’m wrong? It really boggles my mind and it causes so much rage and anxiety within me.

Hey there,

I'm on the lookout for someone ordinary – someone who can be my partner-in-crime, my confidant, and maybe a bit more, if everything works out. But I'm not in a hurry. I believe in taking things slow, like taking our time to build a connection and get to know each other.

So, what exactly am I seeking? Well, I crave deep conversations and witty banter. I want someone who isn't afraid to open up to each other's emotional insecurities, trauma, let's just try to be real with each other, also someone who can match my curiosity and sense of humor (the darker the better). 

When it comes to interests, I appreciate art of all kinds, I have a deep appreciation for psychedelic art and music. I'm a big arsenal football club fan, also I'm a huge mental health advocate, let's be kind to each other. I enjoy watching critically acclaimed TV shows. I'm fueled by coffee and driven by guilt. Currently on a fitness journey, Trying to be regular at the gym and eating healthy, I would love it I f we could exchange healthy cooking recipes.

But enough about me – I'm very much interested in learning about you. Your likes, icks, tics and everything else. Let's even share our playlists. I would be more than happy it if you could give skin care and hair care tips. 

So, if you're up for intellectually stimulating conversations, sharing funny anecdotes, a genuine connection that transcends the superficial and dives deep into the essence of our beings or simply enjoying the silence of a comfortable conversation, I'm here for it all. Shoot me a DM if you relate and seek something similar.

1gsm1d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1gsm1d5/im_dreading_sunday_night/,I'm dreading Sunday night ...,"**A bit of context:** just finished week 9 on Oz, 3 months of which I have basically been immobile due to excruciating joint pain in my left knee. Finally had a cortisone shot last week & am slowly working on building back up the muscles & can only walk short distances. Sucks. As of last week I have lost 3kg in 2 months & but I am grateful for any weight loss at all! Meanwhile, I have just started a 4 week caravan holiday with husband. Tomorrow, Sunday is my fifth 0.5 shot (I have decided to stay on this over the holiday). However I'm worried...

Up to 2 weeks ago, I hadn't had any bad reactions, (apart from mild nausea) to my doses. I normally eat a healthy diet, no junk food, eat out little. Sunday 2 weeks ago (Week 3 of my 0.5 dose) was my birthday & it unfortunately was a bit of a food fest. Brunch with kids I had eggs benedict (with salmon), and later a Thai meal after a show with friends (I ate sparingly, tastes of pad thai, red duck curry, pork belly...). That night (fortunately after we got home) was terrible, awful cramps a veritable fountain at both ends, & a lonely night in the bathroom. Wrote it off to too much fatty food, lesson learned, moved on.   
  
Unfortunately it happened *again* the next (last) Sunday night after my shot. I had cooked a baked lamb for the family & mother in law, but had had literally 2 mouthfuls before deciding it was too fatty, & only ate the veges (baked with no oil/fat). I'm really at a loss to know what happened.

**Question:** tomorrow I again have my shot. We are in a caravan in a caravan park. The ammenities are a walk away & not a convenient few metres away from my bed at home. I obviously don't want have a miserable repeat of the last 2 Sundays. I am trying to prepare to eat really carefully tomorrow & really test if it is the food causing it. I'm hoping others with experience could give me some guidance, also noting that I'm limited with what is available in my caravan fridge/pantry in an isolated national park.

Breakfast: weatbix & lite milk, banana. Should I have flavoured lite yoghurt? Could dairy be a trigger?

Lunch: 2 hard boiled eggs (trying to stay away from cheese) for protein, a slice of toast or 2 with vegemite 

Dinner: lean chicken & salad

We also eat fruit as snacks between meals, especially apples & mandarins. I also have 2 or 3 coffees during the day.   
  
Are there any other suggestions? I have to say I'm dreading tomorrow night. I will report back on my  outcomes.... 😬
