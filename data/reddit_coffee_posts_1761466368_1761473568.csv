Anywho, what do you guys think of meeting up on a weekend in November? I’m thinking the 15/16, 22/23, or 29/30.

If you’re interested in joining, please let me know your preferred date(s)!

Some ideas for meet-ups i’ve had are:

- Board game cafe in Waterloo 
- Flight club or bowling 
- Meet at a free museum
- Walk around a park with coffees, or walk and then end up in a cafe/restaurant

I think it would be ideal to arrange something where we can hear and talk to one another. Also avoiding alcohol-based meet-ups in case not everyone is interested in drinking, but those who are could go for drinks afterwards. 

What are your thoughts on these ideas? Anything I’m not foreseeing, or any other ideas you have? 

I’ll probably eventually make a WhatsApp group if there is really enough interest and this gets off the ground :)

Thanks y’all! ❤️❤️

**Parse the Odds: The Math Doesn’t Lie (Mostly)**  
Let’s start with the numbers. Chengdu Rongcheng FC is the overwhelming favorite here, with bookmakers pricing them between **1.31 and 1.47** (implying a **68–76% chance to win**). Qingdao West Coast, meanwhile, is a longshot at **6.0 to 7.5 odds** (11–15% implied probability), while the draw sits at **4.6 to 5.5 odds** (18–22%). These numbers scream “Chengdu should win,” but let’s not let the math drown out the chaos of football.

**Digest the News: A Tale of Two Teams**  
Chengdu Rongcheng, the team that once led the league but now stumbles like a drunk Go player mid-game, has won just once in their last three matches. They’ve rested key players for the AFC Champions League, which is like sending your best Go pieces to a coffee break—refreshing, but risky. Qingdao West Coast, on the other hand, just lost 2-1 to Shenzhen Peng City *while playing with nine men*. That’s the football equivalent of losing a chess game after your opponent accidentally knocks over your king. Still, Qingdao’s resilience is notable—they’ve clawed through adversity, much like a Go player who turns a 9-0 deficit into a comeback by sheer willpower.

**Humorous Spin: Stones on the Board, Wits on the Line**  
Chengdu’s offense is like a well-oiled Go board: precise, methodical, and occasionally cursed by a rogue stone that rolls off the table. Their recent struggles? Imagine a Go grandmaster w

1oggugd,https://www.reddit.com/r/keys/comments/1oggugd/pianomotion_give_life_back_to_selfplaying_piano/,PianoMotion - Give Life Back To Self-Playing Piano,"Bonjour! I’m a piano and tech enthusiast, and I just finished developing **PianoMotion**, an Android app (totally free and free of ads!) that lets you play **any piano MIDI file wirelessly via Bluetooth** on your acoustic player piano (Yamaha Disklavier, Steinway Spirio, Bösendorfer CEUS, PianoDisc, QRS, …).

📥 **Download the APK here:** [PianoMotion on GitHub](https://github.com/KevinChopin/PianoMotion)

How it works:

1. Plug a **Bluetooth MIDI adapter** (Yamaha MD-BT01, CME WIDI Master, or any compatible model) into your piano’s MIDI ports.
2. Connect your phone via Bluetooth.
3. Load any piano MIDI file.
4. Press **play** – watch your piano perform!

**Why I made it:**

There are very few accessible apps that truly unlock the magic of these instruments. I wanted to create something **simple, free, and ad-free**, so anyone could enjoy their piano, no matter its age.

I built **PianoMotion** because it was frustrating to see manufacturers either **offer only poor-quality apps** for their pianos or **abandon older instruments entirely**, pushing you to buy a new one without proper software support. With PianoMotion, you can **play your favorite MIDI tracks, record your own performances, revive old Disklavier floppy disks**, (and soon even **sing along while your piano plays the backing**!). NB: App is currently in French but English version is coming soon.

Features:

* 🎵 Play MIDI files wirelessly via Bluetooth
* 🎹 Record and replay your own performances
* 🔜 Soon: “Voice + MIDI” mode – sing while your piano plays
* 💖 Completely free and ad-free

**Try it & Give Feedback**

I’d love for everyone to try PianoMotion. Your bug reports, suggestions, and feature ideas are what will help make this app better and more enjoyable for the piano community.

1oggsdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fast_Artichoke_5420/comments/1oggsdx/do_not_download_unusual_or_unknown_apps_from/,Do not download unusual or unknown apps from unknown websites or pages.,"Hey everyone. So, I need to tell you a scary story. But it’s not a story from a movie. This really happened to my best friend, Leo. And it’s about an app.

It all started two weeks ago. Leo was super excited. He showed me this new app on his phone called **""Echo.""**

The app was very simple. It listened to all the sounds in a room—like people talking, or a fan spinning—and it deleted those sounds. Then, it played back the one, single sound you were ""meant"" to hear. It found the quiet sound underneath all the noise.

Leo thought it was amazing. In a coffee shop, it would play the sound of one coffee cup touching a table. In the park, it played the sound of one specific bird. It was cool and a little creepy, but we didn't think much of it.

Then, Leo started using it at night, alone in his apartment.

That’s when things got weird.

He told me one morning, ""Dude, this app is glitching."" He said he used it in his silent bedroom, and it played a sound of soft scratching, like a mouse in the wall. But he didn't have any mice.

A few days later, he looked really tired. I asked him what was wrong. He said the app was now making whispering sounds. He said it was a voice that sounded a little like his, but wrong. It whispered things like ""I'm here"" and ""Can you hear me?""

I told him to delete the app. It was clearly broken. He said he would.

But the next day, he called me, and his voice was shaking. He told me he had deleted the app, but the sounds didn't go away.

He said he could now hear the scratching without the app. He heard the whispering in his quiet apartment. He said it felt like something was in the room with him, something he couldn't see.

I was really worried now. I went over to his apartment to check on him. He looked pale and hadn't slept. He told me the last sound the app played before he deleted it was the scariest one.

He was in his kitchen, and the app played the sound of a quiet knock on his own front door. But no one was there.

And then he told me the worst part. The night before, he had heard that same knock. Three soft knocks. *Knock... knock... knock.*

We both sat there in his living room, not knowing what to do. We decided he should stay at my place for a few nights.

But as we were leaving his apartment, he stopped. His eyes were wide with fear. He pointed at his front door and whispered, ""Listen.""

I listened carefully. I couldn't hear anything at first. Then I heard it.

It was a very, very soft sound. It was the sound of someone breathing on the other side of the door.

Leo moved out of his apartment the next day. He's staying with his family now, far away. He says the sounds have mostly stopped, but he still gets scared at night.

We think the app didn't create the sounds. We think it let him hear something that was always there, something hiding in the silence. And by using the app, he accidentally let that thing know that he could hear it.

So, this is my warning to you. Be careful what you download. If you ever see an app called ""Echo,"" do not tap on it. Don't try to find the quiet.

Because you don't know what is already living in it.

1oggqvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1oggqvm/sex_as_currency_no_longer_accepted_here/,"Sex as currency, no longer accepted here","562 days into this streak, my view on women has changed completely. What’s more interesting is how women’s view on me has changed even more.

Before SR, I’d meet a woman and, without even realising it, start working toward the unspoken goal: sex. That was the mission. Most men are still stuck in that loop, working backwards from sex, chasing the “reward.” So much of my life has been upgraded since i started SR, but this post is about women.

I’m single by choice after a brutal breakup with the mother of my daughter. These days, women stare. If I talk to or compliment them, some blush. Some make themselves available without saying it, they just tell me very personal things and laugh at my silly jokes, linger unnecessarily. I say this anonymously, but truthfully: women fall for me easily once they get to know me. Four of the most stunning women at work have asked me out. I can tell they’re also a little intimidated, like they know rejection might be on the table. I went on a date with one of them, and she told me she wanted sex before moving overseas. I said no. I’m still deeply attracted to women, but it’s no longer lust. It’s admiration of heart, mind and soul.

Friends, family, colleagues, even casual acquaintances try to set me up with women. I can feel their energy. It’s like they want me to release, without even knowing I’m retaining… as if holding this energy makes them uncomfortable but they don’t know why. Maybe it would be easier for them if I were “normal.”

I still meet women for coffee or dinner. They can sense it instantly: my end goal isn’t sex, it’s intimacy- far more intimidating for the average woman as they can’t use sex to control me.They feel it before I say a word. Sex as currency is no longer accepted here. That’s my quiet power. It’s what drives my success, my clarity, and my purpose. If I ever meet my true soulmate, it’ll be through this integrity. Or, I’ll meet the man I’m destined to become, one who is not governed by any woman offering sex as currency for control.

So guys review it in Sandalwood scenario.,"Indian romantic movies, from Bollywood spectacles to South Indian mass hits, are built on a core plot structure that is undeniably a direct rip-off of 18th-century Western sentimental novels like *Pamela*, *Pride and Prejudice*, and *Romeo & Juliet*—tropes of rich-poor divides, family opposition, misunderstandings, and grand reunions entered India through British education and Parsi theatre in the 19th century. However, this borrowed skeleton is merely the foundation; Indian cinema transforms it into something uniquely its own by infusing it with indigenous emotional DNA from ancient Sanskrit epics (*Ramayana*, *Shakuntalam*), Krishna-Radha devotion, and *Kamasutra*-style passion, then amplifying it with regional masala—six song-dance sequences in Swiss Alps or rain-soaked fields, hero-worshipping punch dialogues, caste and honor conflicts, comedic side tracks, and larger-than-life climaxes. Bollywood specializes in escapist, family-approved fantasies (*DDLJ*, *K3G*) with no kissing but plenty of wet sarees and NRI longing, while pre-2010 South Indian mass romances (*Ghilli*, *Okkadu*, *Padayappa*) wrap the same Western love story in lungi-clad fights, 100-day theatrical runs, and raw regional swagger. Post-2010 South cinema (*96*, *Premam*) pushes further into realism—live-ins, divorce, silence over songs, and caste violence—making it more progressive than both Bollywood and its Western roots. In the end, Indian romantic films are not mere copies; they are a triumphant cultural remix—British teacup, South Indian filter coffee, served with full desi drama.

Context: been working in BPO for 12 years and now corporate set up since i was 18 so i was got addicted to coffee — wayback 2018-2022 siguro i would have 3-5 cups if not mug 😂 of coffee in a day (black no cream no sugar). Pero lately due to stress sa work and overthinking, affected na ang quality of sleep ko and for 4 weeks or more now i can only get 4-5 of sleep in a day. I drink 1 cup of coffee (black) in the morning na lang po pero medyo matapang sya in the morning.

Tried to stop pero parang kumakanta talaga si Sarah G ng ‘tila ako’y naka lutang na sa langitttt’ grabe yung mood ko and focus ko affected. Help please.

1oggio7,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1oggio7/part2_i_built_an_app_that_uni_students_actually/,Part2 - I Built an App That Uni students Actually Needs (For Free),"Hey guys 👋    
A few months ago, I shared my story here, how I built a campus app even though I’m a mechatronics student (still not a CS guy 😭). That post blew up more than I expected, and honestly… it gave me the motivation to keep going when I almost gave up.    
  
 🧠 A Small Recap  
When I first entered UTM, I thought uni life would be like the movies, full of friends, random events, late-night hangouts.    
But it wasn’t like that. Most days felt lonely.    
  
People just sat with their headphones on.    
Group chats were either dead 💀 or full of spam ads.    
And every week, I kept hearing:    
\> “Bro, you missed that event just now.”    
\> “Someone sold their iPad cheap yesterday, you missed it.”    
  
That’s when I realised:  
\- We’re more connected than ever but still feel isolated.    
\- Students are broke, always hunting for deals.    
\- Most social apps feel fake, not built for us.    
  
So I tried something crazy. I built my own app.    
  
💻 What Happened Next  
It started as a small side project,  just me, YouTube tutorials, and coffee at 2 a.m.    
I broke the code countless times. My adik and friend ignored half my messages 💀.    
But slowly, it started to work.    
  
Today, I’m proud (and still shocked) to say:    
\- 2k+ students signed up    
\- 1k+ Android downloads    
\- 400+ iPhone downloads  

https://preview.redd.it/5ynbqhjgffxf1.jpg?width=591&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63d0ad025942f425f2a4651609b937224b0dc317

And students actually use it, to rant, buy/sell stuff, and discover campus events.    
Some even told me they found new friends through the app. That made all the sleepless nights worth it. 😭    
  
💬 Why I’m Posting Again  
This isn’t a promo. It’s a **thank you and a small request.**    
I’m still just one student trying to build something real, not a startup, not a company, just a project made from the heart.  If you believe Malaysian students deserve a better way to connect, please give **Campus** a try or share it with your uni friends.    
  
👉 [https://about.cmpsapp.com](https://about.cmpsapp.com)   
  
Every download, every feedback, every small shoutout helps me keep improving it.    
Any bugs, just tell here r/cmpsapp   
  
I don’t know if this app will ever become big,  but I do know it already made a few students feel less alone.    
And for me, that’s already a win ❤️    
  
Thanks for reading this far.    
From one student to another — appreciate you all 🙏",2,1761471788.0,malaysiauni,0,1.0,False

 I honestly don't know what to do I'm freaking tf out. My mom is being very nonchalant about the whole thing and isn't much help. She suggested to just read it as normal and when i told her i don't think thats a good idea she said i should just wipe it off with some antibacterial wipes and  but im not sure if that's safe? I feel like the moisture might even make it worse

I considered calling my library and asking them what to do about it even though i hate making phone calls but its Sunday and the next two days are holidays here and im not sure uf they will be open then. And i probably won't be able to return it until the next weekend either ways. So I guess i thought this sub might be the next best thing.

What do i do? Is it safe to read until i can return it? It's been and still is on the coffee table on our living room since i got it so its both been near me, my family and my cat. Is it possible for any of us to get any sort of disease from it or something? 

From a quick search most people seemed to suggest i put it in the freezer but i feel weird putting it near food and my parents would most likely yell at me ke for it

Pic 3 is the back of the first page. I flipped through it and it seems to be the only mouldy one

Im really sorry if this doesn't make much sense. I just discovered it and im panicking

All you need to do is open all maps, increase the aggressivness of the scavs so they're not basically braindead waiting for a headshot and you're all set! People enjoy going into a more relaxed mode and if you want PVP, upgrade to LD and you're good to go!

We weren’t together for that long, it was around 4 months. It was my first real relationship, and his first relationship. Before him, I thought I was incapable of genuinely liking anyone again, but I really did fall for him.

Things didn’t work out because he was not ready at all for a relationship. It was really obvious to everyone in his life, and it was to me too but I didn’t want to admit it. It’s absolutely no discredit to him, he really is a great guy, but he couldn’t prioritise anyone above himself at this point in his life, yet alone me. His friends and family noticed that he was falling short as a boyfriend, and I was giving more than he could. They told him to step up but he just was not ready to. It does take a lot of emotional maturity, vulnerability and consistency to show up and prioritise someone in a relationship. I should’ve known it would be like that from the start, because it’s so obvious that he’s just not there yet.

I don’t miss the relationship, because even though we got along so well, and did have some really good moments, I generally felt bad. I wasn’t being treated or prioritised in the way I felt a girlfriend should be. He said he still really wanted me in his life and wanted to be friends but I told him no. I know things weren’t working out with him, and I wanted to move on. Investing in a friendship would stop me from letting go and moving forwards with my life. If he can’t prioritise and treat me right, then I don’t want to spend anymore time hurting, instead I want to grow and eventually find someone who does.

What I miss though, is his family. He has a really big family, and I got pretty close to them over those months. His aunty reached out to me over messages, saying we should catch up. His grandparents always look so happy to see me  and talk to me at Church. His mum talks to me every chance she gets, inviting me to lunch and coffee dates. I became good friends with his cousin and today she told me that I made “such a positive impact on the whole family”. His mum told that same cousin, and another friend that she misses having me around as much. I’ve been told by several people that his youngest sister (10) really looks up to me. We graduated high school yesterday and his family came up to me and hugged me, and talked to me for nearly the whole thing. Both our families talked, and even him and I talked for the first time since the break up.

His family honestly became a second family to me. I feel so seen and loved by them, and I love them. I don’t want to lose my connection to them. Part of me wishes things worked out just so I could always be a part of it. ",1,1761470942.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Quite rich though, but the dip did a great job of adding some salt and dimension. Would have liked more textures and perhaps something with a bit of acidity to cut the richness.

In the US, a double-shot Americano would never be diluted to more than 12oz, but here it seems they often go 16oz or more.

Our mission is to party straight through the night until we see the actual sunrise.

**Here’s the catch:** We are *aggressively* broke.

Like, ""drowning in student loans"" and ""checking our bank accounts before buying coffee"" broke.

We’re looking at Manhattan, but it seems like every party has a $50 cover and $22 drinks, which is basically our food budget for the week.

So, wise New Yorkers, what’s the game plan for a crew with no money?

We need:

1. **A good neighborhood to bar-hop**.
2. Bars/pubs/dives with **LOW or NO COVER CHARGE**.
3. Places that will actually be a fun party (not just an empty room).
4. Crucially: Any spots open past 4 AM (or a 24/hr diner) where we can wait for the sun.

Hit us with your most gate-kept secrets. We are putting our Halloween faith entirely in your hands. Help us make some fun, broke decisions!",0,1761470284.0,AskNYC,3,0.33,False

I’m Sam, Director of Meridian Space Command based at Space Park Leicester. We run actual space missions for clients around the world and also do a lot of professional and academic education in space and robotics etc. 

I’m considering opening a new place in the city centre called “CTRL Room”, a hands-on technology and science cafe. 

The idea is to create a space where people can:

	•	Try out robotics and drones in a small indoor “pit” / “cage”. 

	•	Learn coding, AI and space tech

	•	Use computer stations in an internet café style setup, tinkering with robotic builds etc. 

	•	Free tea and coffee or BYO

	•	Browse a small shop with space and robotics merchandise

Thought is that you’d pay per hour to explore and use the equipment, whether kids, students or adults who want to learn something new. 

I’m trying to gauge local interest before committing to a unit downtown. The one above Nero, attached. 

Would you (or your family, students or colleagues) come to something like this?

Open all week? Just after school and weekends, and all week during school holidays? 

What would feel like a fair hourly rate: £5, £10, £15? Day rate instead? Monthly subscription?

And is there anything you’d love to see included?

Thanks,

Like the title says  I am 29F he is 33M together 5 yrs 

I spent NYE 2021 and 2022 with my boyfriend and his friends at his request. Both times were boring, crappy music, crappy conversations, crappy food with his friends that smoke pot everyday. Neither me or boyfriend smoke pot so we just sat there watching them get high. His friend who hosts new years has a 7 bedroom mansion yet we all have to sleep on the cold gard floor. 

I refused to spend NYE with him again when I woke up on 1st January 2023 on the cold floor. Bf said he was going to put bags in the car but didn’t come back for an hour. I found out he’d left me for an hour upstairs whilst he sat having coffee and breakfast with his friends. He didn’t call me down or even think to ask me if I wanted  breakfast and he refused to acknowledge he did anything wrong. His response was ‘you’re an adult you should have come downstairs, I shouldn’t have to call you’. I was incredibly hurt and to this day he’s failed to take responsibility for it. My family and friends are abroad and I flew back on 31st December early to spend NYE with him and that’s how he treats me.

Fast forward to 2025, were on a city trip to Paris. A few weeks ago he mentioned NYE and said we could spend it with his friends. I said no, I’m not going to do that because they’re boring potheads but we can either.

1. Organise a trip for the two of us
2. Spend NYE separately (he goes to his friends I go to mine)

He said he would look into organising a trip for us. It’s been three weeks and we’re having a nice time in Paris. He randomly says ‘what’s the plan for nye?’ And I asked him if he’d looked into making plans for the two of us that didn’t involve going to his friends. He said no and that he really wanted to go to his friends and expected me to join.

Now I’m upset that he said he would organise smth but had no intention. His plan was always to guilt trip me into spending nye with him and his waster friends.

Now he’s not speaking to me, refusing to eat and the trip to Paris is ruined.

1ogg0mz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbortionPillsByPost/comments/1ogg0mz/traumatizing_abortion_procedure/,Traumatizing abortion procedure,"Last year, I was pregnant and tried to take pills from local sellers off of FB (Philippines). I was at around 8 weeks. I was advised to use primrose evening oil, pineapple juice, and black coffee for preparation. For the procedure, I was told to fast before doing it. The procedure included me inserting pills up to my cervix, melting pills between my cheeks, and steaming myself. The procedure was very difficult for me because I was having fever and puked. I bled but the procedure did not work as I vomited some of the medicines. I know I had to redo the procedure but I was only able to buy more pills when I was at 14-17 weeks since I was tight on money. I was advised to do the same procedure but failed again since I vomited the medication again. A few hours after, my amniotic sac bursted then the blood. My body wanted to release the baby but I was having a hard time pushing. We decided to go to the hospital to induce the labor. I conceived the baby but had to get additional procedures to clean my womb. It was an overall traumatizing experience for me since they knew I had an abortion and treated me badly.

Now I’m having an unwanted pregnancy again at 6 weeks and want to terminate but I’m scared that what happened will happen again. I heard from someone that there are pills that I can take orally instead of inserting it up the cervix. Women Help Women services aren’t available in my country based on their reply to my inquiry. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. I know it’s my fault for not taking proper precautions. ",1,1761469875.0,AbortionPillsByPost,0,0.99,False
1ogg0cm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ogg0cm/nervous_about_sober_october_ending/,Nervous about Sober October ending,"A bit of background, I (38m) have spent the last 5+ years drinking heavily every night. Pre-October, there were only 6 nights in the previous 2 years where I hadn’t had a drink, all of which were times I ‘had’ to and were a massive struggle. 

Sober October was a lifeline almost, if I can just get through it I will prove I don’t have a problem.

I’m proud of myself to say that I’ve smashed this month, I committed and sustained my sobriety everyday. There was struggle, cravings, tears, frustration but on the flip side… there was some peace, less anxiety, better sleep, money saved.

I’m sure along with most people reading this, I have intrinsically understood that this is so much more than ‘getting through October’. My body and mind needed to stop my toxic behaviours, leaning into the bottle every night to get some calm only for it to keep me in a constant state of fog and confusion and anxiety. Alcohol strips me of myself, and leaves an empty vessel of me in its wake. 

This month I’m remembering the old me, small pleasures have slowly crept back in, enjoying mornings, coffee, quiet time, walks. I feel capable and I feel more worthy.

A huge part of getting me through has been telling myself that I can do one month, and as I see the days getting less and less I’m getting scared. This morning, I crossed off the last Saturday in October, another sober weekend done. In the back of my mind, the last sober weekend I ‘have’ to do.

I want this to be my new life, I want to have a sober November, a sober Christmas, a sober 2026. In the back of my mind I know this, I just don’t feel strong enough. 

It’s gotten easier as the month has gone on, but the promise in the back of my head saying on the 1st November, I can drink at the Halloween party I’m attending is deafeningly loud.

Any one else used October as a starting point and having concerns now that it’s drawing to a close? 

This sub is life saving, it has gotten me through some of the most difficult moments. Thank you to anyone and everyone who has commented on any of my posts, or posted your story. I’ve absorbed every damn word and I’m grateful.

I’m a freelance designer who spends my days coming up with ideas for stuff like t-shirts, posters, and other creative goodies.
 I love the process, but staying disciplined on creative projects can feel like herding cats sometimes. When I started out, I’d wait for inspiration to strike, but that left me procrastinating way too much, like, I’d end up binge-watching YouTube instead of sketching. After some trial and error, I found a weirdly specific trick that works for me: I set up a dedicated “creation station” on my desk with a specific mug of coffee, a lavender-scented candle, and a lo-fi hip-hop playlist. It’s like a ritual that flips a switch in my brain to say, “Alright, it’s time to get to work!” It’s weird, but now I can’t slack off once that setup’s in place.
 I’m curious, what’s one oddly specific habit, routine, or trick you’ve discovered to keep yourself disciplined on your creative projects, whether it’s art, writing, music, or even coding?

I’ve been going for about two months.

In one of the first sessions, during the morning break, an older man asked me if I had a partner. It was part of a group chat, so it didn’t seem odd at first. I said no, and he said, “Oh, I’m surprised.” When I asked why, he said, “Forgive me if I’m wrong for saying this, but you’re very attractive and intelligent when you speak.”

I was flattered but didn’t think too much of it at the time. Then another day, when we were walking to the car park, I thanked him for the compliment, and he said, “If I were younger and not married, I’d be interested in you.” He always says things like this in a kind of joking, light-hearted way, but it still lands.

Later, after I had a bit of a breakdown in a session, he invited me and another woman from the group to grab coffee afterwards. I went along because it was a nice day, and I was keen to chat to both of them outside the group. While we were chatting alone, he told me I have a “lovely smile that lights up my whole face.” then his phone rang, he ignored it for a while, and it was his wife. 

When we left, he gave me a hug and told me to take care of myself (since i had been so upset).

The next day, I texted to thank him for paying for lunch and shared a photo of my artwork (he’d asked to see it before). He didn’t reply for two days. Then he messaged asking how I was going and called me, but I didn’t answer. He texted again today asking if I was okay. I just replied, “I’m fine, see you at DBT next week,” I am trying to cut this man off, because he's bad news.

Now I’m trying to detach and not get swept up in this situation, but it’s so hard. When you’ve felt neglected, lonely, and unseen for so long, any attention feels like gold. He’s not even someone I’m physically attracted to, but his energy, and the way he speaks to me — it hits me deeper than I want to admit.

I feel ashamed because I know he’s married, and he's clearly crossing lines. But I can’t seem to stop the part of me that craves the attention. I hate that if he pursued me further, I don’t trust myself to say no.

I had years of dirty fasting, not really believing the author of Fast,Feast, Repeat who said the magic is in the clean fast. I would put cream/milk in my coffee and keep spinning my wheels, getting nowhere. Hence my desire to try something different! 

Anyway, this morning, I fully intended to do my next 36 hours fast (I've done ADF this whole week, really well) but have had very bad sleep a few nights in a row, was tired, so I just said, "" it's ok, I'll just put a little cream in my coffee just today"". But this time, I finally noticed how dirty fasting makes me feel. Because I've had 2 months of clean fasting, I could tell the difference. I felt hungry, a little while after the coffee finished, and for the rest of the morning I had food thoughts and was distracted. Not a good feeling, esp when I can usually have that black coffee and not think about food for hours and hours. 

I finally caved and had a small meal with my son while he ate his late lunch. I decided I'd make it a 500cal meal day for my Down Day (8 usually go without any calories on down day). Then I ate this and that and... I decided I had to make it a normal eating window day (19:5). I wasn't happy about this, as I had wanted to do another 36:12 cycle.

So..I'm glad I have had this lesson, as I know I want to aim to fast clean from now on.

Same goes for them. We earn difference amounts of money, I have a lower income but save most of it whereas they have a higher income and buy whatever makes them happy. I asked them over the phone tonight if they would make me a steak for dinner tomorrow night.

1ogft0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1ogft0r/is_he_interested_in_me/,Is he interested in me?,"It’s been a couple of days since I met a guy during a study trip. He and I immediately got along and joked a lot about everything. The last four days were when I started to feel something between us. One of those days we spent together with the others at the beach and at a sushi restaurant, where he had never been before — he even asked me for advice. At the beach, he made everyone wait 10 minutes just so I could get my swimsuit, which another guy had borrowed.

One day, while we were coming back from a group outing, he and I fell behind to talk alone about relationships and dating. He told me about a girl he used to talk to and how things ended between them. I listened and gave him my opinion. Then we started talking about homosexuality, and he said he supports it and isn’t homophobic.

When we got back home, we went to sleep, and the next day he called me to see if I was running late. That day we spent time joking and playing together on the school’s sports field with the others. We ate in the same place and kept teasing each other. Then he asked me, away from everyone else, to come with him to find a bathroom, so we were alone for a while. We talked about how some people on this trip wanted to start relationships or just hook up, and we agreed that things should go slowly and not be rushed. We stayed alone a bit longer, then took a short walk to rejoin the others.

That evening, we all went out together (both those from our study group and the host students) and had some drinks. It was a great night, but at some point, after I had a bit to drink, I started crying over love. When he saw me, he asked me to go for a walk alone with him to calm down. We stayed by ourselves for about 30 minutes, and he said the most beautiful things I’ve ever heard about what I was going through (I had been seeing a guy who said he liked me but didn’t really show it — and since the beginning of that trip, I’d actually been interested in him). I explained everything without revealing that I’m gay. He comforted me, and we talked for a while. Then I asked if we could get a bottle of water; he came with me to a bar, lied about our ages, and bought me a Coke — he paid for it without saying anything.

When we left, we rejoined the others, but he found another excuse for us to be alone again, taking a different street to go somewhere else for drinks. After spending the evening like that, we went home around 3 a.m., and he told me that even though he was exhausted, he’d stay awake and that I could text him. And so I did — we talked until around 4 or 4:30 a.m.

The next day (the last one), we were supposed to go out with the group. When he saw no one was ready, I told him that the guy hosting me didn’t want to go out, and he said, “I’m going out anyway — if you want, we can go together.” That didn’t seem weird since we were supposed to meet the others. In the end, we went to a supermarket, bought croissants, water, and coffee — and again he paid for me, saying it wasn’t a problem and I didn’t owe him anything. We had breakfast together, just the two of us, and spent about half an hour alone.

At the airport, we didn’t talk as much, but when he saw me sad about leaving, he hugged me and asked if I wanted to look around the shops together. He also said he’d get the same drink as me from Starbucks. On the plane, he kept checking on me and tried in every way to help charge my phone, worrying about me. On the bus ride home, I started crying again, and he jokingly called me “his man” while hugging me, as he had done several times before.

I don’t really know how to interpret all of this. We’re no longer on the trip, so we won’t see each other often, but we live in the same city. Throughout all this, he’s given me lots of compliments, and I feel like there might be something between us — but at the same time, he used to be in a relationship with a girl, and he said he wasn’t gay but not in a direct way it was related to a joke we made about a thing, but i think he could be bisexual also because while talking about a talking stage he had with someone he used almost always neutral for when talking about “this person “ and sometimes he used the male gender too - recently was joking around with a girl from the trip (I think just as friends, though).

*By The Sportswriter Who Still Thinks ""Leg Before Wicket"" Is a Dance Move*

**The Matchup:**  
England (2 convincing wins, 4 meh performances) vs. New Zealand (1 win, 5 losses, and a suitcase full of ""What If?"").

**Why It Matters:**  
England needs this win to secure a *less-embarrassing* semi-final seeding. New Zealand? They’re here to sign autographs for the kids and maybe test-drive a few young players.

**Key Stats:**

* **England’s Batting:** Amy Jones (consistent as a coffee machine), Nat Sciver-Brunt (the human equivalent of a Swiss Army knife), and Heather Knight (the ""I’ll bat first, thank you very much"" specialist). The rest? A mystery novel titled *Where’s My Boundary?*
* **England’s Bowling:** Sophie Ecclestone and Lauren Bell are the duo that whispers ""wicket"" to the opposition.
* **New Zealand’s Batting:** Sophie Devine is the lone star in a constellation of duds. Suzie Bates and Amelia Kerr? More like *Amelia Who?*
* **New Zealand’s Bowling:** Brooke Halliday and Izzy Gaze are the ""let’s pretend we’re not eliminated"" brigade.

**Player Props to Bet On (If Bookmakers Had Odds):**

1. **Sophie Ecclestone (England) – Overs Bowled:** Over 4.5 (she’s the team’s emotional support spinner).

I was concious about my health all my life as an ex-athlete. But had some good party years as well.

Currently the health optimization becomes somewhat an obsession.

After getting a wearable I saw the influence of alcohol on my sleep. Since then I stopped with alcohol almost completely. For sure cut out the excressive drinking.

I dont go to parties anymore because I cant handle the disturbed sleep when I go to bed at 5 am in the morning.  
I just fell in love with good sleep.

Currently Iam cutting down my caffeine consumption.  
Currently Iam down to 1 cup of coffee per day (came from 4 cups daily).

But coffee is my last drug I consume. After that my life will be completely drug free.

Is there any fun left?  
With not drinking coffee, what do I do in my work breaks? All my colleagues drink coffee.

Its almost a spiritual journey when we wander to the cofee machine lol. 

But when I learned that coffee was given to workers to enhance their work load I got really mad and the urge to quit became larger.

I've been talking to, then started seeing and more lately the past 2 months we've been either talking all day or seeing eachother for sleepovers and dinners etc.. every other night.
We haven't discussed what we are, but it's obviously something that we're both choosing to put a lot of energy and time into... in a good way. I thought?
Last night, I was particularly upset about some news that affected my work, aka me getting paid.. twice. these were two big jobs i were counting on to be paid by.
So we're on the phone and i found out about the 2nd one and was so upset, i abruptly said ""im so upset, im so upset let me please call you later"" and he said ""ok"" and i hung up.
texting me a few minutes later he offered me a few things he had at his house to eat for dinner. and a sweet notion i agree-
then texted me saying ""goodnight (my name) im going to bed soon, im beat""
(after going to the spa and eating dinner at a very nice/expensive restaurant)
and i was driving at the time.
so by the time i got home, 10 minutes had passed and i just assumed he went to sleep. and that's the last thing he's said to me-

that was around 11pm friday night.
it’s now 1:30am, sunday morning☹️

i haven't reached out because:

1- if he was that upset, there's no way i would choose to go to bed knowing that he's going to be alone stewing and being upset/going to bed upset. and waking upset.
2- he knows that (he works nights, but still gets up every morning around 8/9) all he had to do was call me in the morning or come over (we live just blocks from one another in a downtown city) with idk a mcmuffin or coffee or the coffee he makes for me with the bacon he makes.. extra crispy for me everytime i wake up at his place 🥺

he knows i was upset, and he knows- he knows
           i'm. baby.

and to not say anything to me for 24 hours is absolutely bananas.
but he had time to watch a scary 
movie and post  a story about it on social media.
i asked him other day if he had plans for halloween.. obviously that’s like a nudge at “i want to do something with you” and he said “oh im going with coworkers to some haunted houses”

ok well ill be the fool if every one of his coworkers DONT bring their gf’s/bf’s/spouses.

I've been sitting on this post since the server slam and struggling to put some of these thoughts into text, whether from my 
lack of experience with the genre, or an unclear picture of what the actual core issues are that are bothering me.

But hey, I'm up and you're refreshing the subreddit impatiently waiting for release, or drinking your morning coffee at the office, so let's chat for a sec.

For biases: I'm a CoD/Destiny (well, you know, used to be) pvp player. I do not like any other extraction shooters. I don't like battle royales. I like intense arena combat with very few dips in the action. Otherwise I've played everything. All the games, every one, all ten. Roblox, Mario, League.

And for the accountant at Embark, I already bought the deluxe edition, several of my also-not-extraction-enjoyers friends picked it up, and I got a really-really-really-not-the-target-audience-casual friend to pick it up as well (curious to see if he sticks, he did not play the slam).

Just establishing a baseline so you can disregard my bad takes here.

Since I don't have any experience with the prior tech tests or a lot of time spent consuming youtube vids on the game, some of my thoughts may well have already been extensively addressed in the game or by the devs already (or the devs may already have mitigations in mind for updates down the road before some of these become problems).

I almost always play with friends, pretty rare I run solo in MP pvp games. PvE I'll solo, so I don't know what that means for AR down the line, we'll see.

Play wise I put 24 hours into the server slam, mostly in duos and trios, occasionally solo. Did all the vendor quests, did the harvester event solo and in a group, hunted players, goofed around with all the gear, saw all the weapons, used almost all the weapons, used all gadgets except the GRAPPLING HOOK, why did no one tell me this game has a GRAPPLING HOOK

(GRAPPLING HOOK)

Played on controller, mkb for inventory management at base. I hate inventory management. May do mkb at launch for some pvp, we'll see.

Anyway, thoughts:

1\. **Static spawn locations**

By the last two days, as we had no more quests to tackle and had already done various goof-around runs to play with equipment and ARC behavior, we loaded up with our best gear every run and just went player hunting.

Ignoring late joins (which are cool!), it quickly became apparent that the fastest, safest, and easiest way to find and ambush players was tuck away your weapon, then sprint and stim your way through the nearest 3-4 other static spawns.

Almost every single time we did this we'd catch one or more teams out - either spotting them immediately, or they'd give away their location near spawn via ARC fights or looting.

I don't love this - the best part of the game by far is when combat becomes a crazy chaotic goofy mix of ARC, players, and third/fourth parties all joining the mix, at odd places on the map, resulting in some genuinely hilarious moments.

Conversely, the most annoying moments by far were the generic extraction shooter stuff - camping the extract, camping corners indoors at some high traffic loot spot, etc.

This behavior (hunting spawns immediately with dedicated pvp kit) feels like that latter stuff - it's pretty low risk, with potentially great rewards.

Consider: If we run into other players who want to pvp, great! That's what we want. If we run into someone who just wants to pve, they're going to have a bad time. If we run into duo or solo they're in trouble if we're running as a trio. And if we ambush anyone who casually strolled out of spawn and started looting or shooting arc while we're beelining at pvp speed, they're obviously at a disadvantage.

It's basically all upside from our perspective, and potentially a really unpleasant experience for the people we're hunting.

This is after a *day* of collective playtime. What about after a month? Six months? Hunters will know exact spawn locations, probable travel routes, ideal ambush locations, etcetc. It will get worse, more frustrating for newer/less experienced/more pve oriented/solo players, and easier and more efficient for pvp focused trios.

Some of that is inevitable, but it's specifically the static nature of the spawns that feels like the issue here.

What's the solution? I'm assuming every extract shooter runs into this problem, I haven't played enough to see common solutions. Is it not actually a problem?

2\. **What's the endgame?**

For clarity, this is a possibly a distant concern that will be totally irrelevant in practice due to economy tuning, and pvp danger level.

Once my quest list is cleared out and my vault is full to the brim with loot, what does the game look like? And yes, I'm aware of expeditions.

Let's say I have no external motivators (quests/tasks/events guiding me to go to certain maps, use certain gear, accomplish certain tasks), only intrinsic ones like 'shooting other players is fun'. Now 'getting more powerful items' is definitely a constant motivator, but again, this is assuming my vault is at the point where I can comfortably run a high powered loadout easily.

I'm worried that the strength of pvp *alone* in this game won't be enough to hold me (or more specifically, my friend group - they quit, I quit). pve absolutely will not be, ARC is fantastic as the extra sauce in pvp encounters, but Embark were correct that the game as a pve only experience wouldn't have been it - I would not be buying the game if it was pve only with this roster of bots and amount of content.

Do any longer term players with more experience have any insight into this? Or even other extraction games? Is there always another task to chase to give you something to do other than hunt players explicitly as your singular goal? Is the economy typically so harsh or deaths in pvp so common that you *can't* build up a safety vault of high power gear?

I've seen the rumblings of potential raid type areas or events, maybe time limited high challenge zones with unique ARC and loot - that's absolutely appealing, and could be a trials of osiris/raid/iridescent ranked type goal to aim for with the rest of our runs, having that aspirational target is important *even for players in my group who don't participate in that type of content very often*. It generates conversation, it encourages research, loadout optimization, planning and preparation, practice and execution - you know the drill if you've ever routinely targeted any endgame goal in your game of choice.

Also I've seen stuff about leaderboards in a few UI elements, but no details - how does that work here?

3\. **Player skill ramp**

Destiny had a very wide range of activities that appealed to a very broad set of players for pve and pvp. Even within pvp, it had a range of activities from very casual to very intense. CoD has something similar, with very relaxed public lobbies in MP and Warzone, and much sweatier lobbies ~~infested with cheaters~~ in ranked play.

CoD also has (or maybe had) SBMM protecting players from wildly out of bounds encounters for the most part (though that's changing this year, to my complete surprise).

From what I've seen, there's no such huge range of 'modes' or activities here in AR to spread out the player population naturally to their preferred sweatiness level.

Similarly there's no background system balancing lobbies, beyond group/solo.

Which means, what do lobbies look like in six months or a year? Streamer sweat gank squads brutally camping every extraction spot with ideal lines of sights for their triple Osprey picks? (or whatever exotic weapon, if it turns out certain legendaries are the pvp meta of choice)

Extraction sites are fixed, AR lacks the variable random endzone of a BR, which means optimal camps will be worked out and abused.

I don't think 'gearscore' or skill matchmaking would fix this either, it's going to be the same issue, just much much more frustrating if you're a new player.

4\. **Solo/group balance**

I can't find an exact number, but it sounds like player count per lobby varies from something like 15 to 20+ depending on solo/duo/trio count, late joins, max initial size, etc.

This results in a weird issue where the smaller the group sizes (solo/duos), the *more* likely you are to get randomly jumped. And playing solo is already inherently more dangerous, unless I'm totally missing something here.

e.g. in a 21 person lobby of trios, that's 7 groups moving together (obviously, not *always* how groups play, but very often). vs. a 20 person lobby of duos, that's 10 groups. But a 20 or even 15 person solo lobby. That's 15 or 20 'groups'!

This may not even be a real problem, but it was definitely on my mind when I was diving in for some quick solo runs to grab specific loot or finish a quest or whatever.

For you solo fans, is this a non issue? Do you like having more people to potentially chat and team up with, or do you dislike randomly running into people more often? Or did you notice no difference in encounter rate if you did play a mix of solos and grouped?

5\. **Cheaters.**

Really needs no elaboration. How's The Finals currently? If this game blows up, they'll be getting much more pressure from cheating businesses.

Destiny never stopped cheaters (if you never followed it, they had an unbelievable, catastrophically high number of cheaters in their last pve raid contest, something like 70% of all day 1 clears were cheaters, and high end pvp has been infested with them for years).

CoD also struggled massively with them in Warzone and Ranked play. I rarely saw them in generic MP lobbies, but it was a huge problem at the higher end. They're rolling out some new secure boot mandatory stuff this year in BO7, we'll see if it helps.

*****
Those are the big ticket items. Here's a few other smaller ones that impacted my enjoyment and are likely to continue to do so.

1\. **3rd person corner camping**

This one is small and specific, but annoys me enough I pulled it out as a full point. I made a post a few days ago about adding lights visible *at short ranges* if you have a shield equipped (and that turn off if you remove your shield) - basically, if you're going to camp a corner in third person in some interior area all match, you'll give your position away unless you're willing to either remove your shield or back off from the corner enough to be forced to rely on ~~your wallhacks~~ sound.

Any veterans of the other tests/other third person pvp games have an opinion on this? Non issue with experience?

By far the least fun I had during the server slam was either a) camping an interior wall and ambushing people or b) walking through an interior area and getting shot by the team doing a)

And to be clear, I'm not talking about *fighting* corner peekers (though I think weapons like the anvil and renegade are going to be a huge problem with this combat system), grenades and flanking both work fine for handling them, I'm talking about the initial ambush, where corner peeking has no risk and tons of reward

2\. **Inventory management on controller**

This needs more love. I made a post about it already but I'll probably do another after launch after I get some more hours in and get more accustomed to using what's there.

MKB has a significant advantage here, particularly with in-combat speed, controller could really use more shortcuts for sort of 'meta functions', like 'get me unburdened instantly' or 'store this specific high value item in my pocket with a button chord', stuff that you can do on mouse trivially fast, but takes enough time in combat to be extremely dangerous in comparison on roller.

Given how important quick slots are for non-gunplay combat functions (they are, in essence, your 'ability slots'), rapidly managing them is really really important, and MKB can far more easily and quickly hotswap items, whether to simply preserve higher powered recovery items, or to cycle in situational quick slot gear on demand.

3\. **Don't let potato visual settings give a huge visibility edge**

This is pretty minor overall since it's player controlled and can be resolved by disabling specific settings that hinder visibility, but it feels kinda lame that a lot of BR/extraction style games encourage turning their beautiful worlds into flat textured garbage.

Specifically thinking of 'I turned down foliage so now you can't hide in that shrub because it doesn't exist, muhahaha', but it applies to a lot of other areas as well, like shadows in interior areas.

Either clamp minimums at a certain point, performance permitting, or add sufficient player visibility tweaks that even full ray traced shadows and HDR on a perfect black display don't hide players that are visible with those options off.

For my part I'll always lean towards making the game look as good as it can, even if it's going to get me killed occasionally. That's a me problem, I accept my darkness/shadow/smoke/tree/explosion induced defeat :D

*****

Anyway that's all, the shape of the issues impacting longer term game health were my main thoughts (and I'd say that I'm bothering to write any of this is a good sign since I'm invested enough to give a shit after a single unhealthy weekend of play, which is more than I can say about some other contemporary peers)

Lately, I’ve been feeling *really* overwhelmed about tipping. It’s basically unavoidable when you live in the U.S.—it’s part of daily life now.

A friend recently pointed out that many places calculate tip percentages on the **total (subtotal + tax)** instead of just the subtotal. Ever since then, I’ve been double-checking and recalculating my tips… but it’s stressful when I’m at a counter and there’s a line behind me. I feel rushed, and it honestly makes me anxious.

At this point, tipping feels almost as expected as sales tax (which is already 10%+ where I live).

So I’m curious:

* What do *you* think is the appropriate amount or percentage to tip?
* How do you personally decide what’s fair?
* And when is it okay **not** to tip without feeling guilty?

I especially struggle with situations like:

* **Hair/nails/lashes/waxing:** These services can cost $200–$300+. Is tipping 15–22% still expected even if the service was just “okay”?
* **Coffee shops:** When the screen asks for $1, $2, or $5, regardless of what I order.
* **Places where you pay before receiving anything:** (like drive-thrus or small gift shops).

Sometimes I even worry that if I *don’t* tip upfront, someone might mess up my order on purpose. 😅

Would love to hear how everyone else navigates this—especially if you’ve found a way to tip fairly *without feeling pressured every time you buy a coffee.*",9,1761467066.0,CasualConversation,21,0.7,False

1ogfa5c,https://i.redd.it/46nefywi1fxf1.jpeg,AIO ending a 3 year relationship ultimately because she went to her ex's at 2am to see her dog? (Long),"My (m38) ex misses (f37) and I have had a rough few days of arguing. 
We both work together, have nearly identical time schedule (nightshift) so we did spend everyday pretty much all day together. We also started living together after only 2 - 3 months of dating.

When we first dated she told me of her ex and how he pretty much did the bare minimum that's required in a relationship and one particular event with him made her decide to leave (Too specific to mention). I helped her move out from his place and into another place until she moved in with me.

She also lost her older dog while with him but they adopted a new dog together, she told me she's a dog mum and her dog is super important to her, but he'll stay there.

This became apparent as for the next 3 years 6 days a week, we wake up, drive to her ex's house, pick up the dog while her ex is at work (she still has a house key and he knew she had, not stealing the dog) walk him, buy him food if needed, go-to the vet etc. 
All fine but as time went on, our lives instead of being about us became about her, the dog and her ex. He broke his arms in a bike accident, the only person he knew who could drive him to appointments was my misses apparently. I went along with it as it was only 3 times over 6 months ish (finished his appointments about April) No reason not to trust her..

But in the begginings of our relationship she had another guy who she knows from high school messaging her, I asked about him and she said bluntly ""he used to tell me to go cheat on my ex with him"" I said ""wtf?"". Then she said ""he also used to send vids of him jerking it"".... 
So I flat out said ""stop talking to him if you want me to be in a relationship"". I thought she did but turned out they were still in communication, I seen it pop up on her brand new smart watch we were excited to get her. 

Asked her why she still talks to him, she said ""he's a different person now he was telling me about his new car"". Like ok wtf, he can tell other people not you fucking block him. This was only 2 weeks ago and I'm not sure if she blocked that guy or not.

As for our most recent argument, she has been getting way too friendly and bantery with a person at work. I've mentioned it to her previously and she brushes it away with ""it's not like that, I don't think it's inappropriate"", problem is even her best friend at work (and others) have noticed too.

She noticed I was quiet going onto our work break (Friday) and asked if everything was ok. I told her that it bothered me how she acted with our colleague and with that she threw her arms up and for the next day gave me the silent treatment.

Silent treatment does rattle me as even if I'm pissed AF I'll reply to a txt from her if she asks if I'm okay while walking or driving etc.

On Saturday I started a few hours before her, still giving minimal communication, as I went into work, she said she was going to see her dog before work. I thought that's fine, might cheer her up. 

I get to work, work 2 hrs before she gets there. Send 4 messages at about half hour intervals just asking if she got home safe, no answer all the way until it's her start time at work. When I seen her, nothing, no wave, no smile or anything. About half hour later I found her and asked how she went walking the dog. 1 word answers were all I got. Asked her what's wrong and she said I went to work early while we were fighting and that annoyed her.

Alright. I admit I left for work but she left to walk the dog. And by the time she would've been home it's time to get ready for work.

I said ""ok"" and left to go back to work in my area. 
I was alone for awhile so I did stew a little bit on it and admittedly was starting to be mad. 

When work finished she wouldn't even look at me. In the car ride to drop a coworker off, not a word. ""I don't want a coffee let's just go home"" she said to me. She loves coffee and her after-work one helps her relax. 

I asked ""why are you still giving me the silent treatment?"" She said she wanted to know why I was so mad at her not answering the txts, straight up said ""you know what you were doing by not replying and making me worry"". She claims that is controlling behaviour and I'm trying to control every little thing she does. 
By now we were at home, still arguing but only going the same points, silent treatment, me being controlling by sending multiple txts. 
She huffed and said ""I have to go get something to eat at maccas as I haven't eaten all night"" I asked ""then why didn't we go get coffee and a sanga like normal?"". Apparently that's controlling behaviour again. 
She left at 12:45am ish.
1.30, still not back.
2.30 still not back.... Starting to think I should message but I don't want to be controlling. 3 am. Nothing from her. 

So I get out of bed thinking she has fallen asleep in the car or something. I didn't message because it takes 5 - 10 mins max to go check the carparks easy done.
No no no.. after not finding her car in either maccas's, a knot in my stomach said just go past her ex's, just check.
Yep. She was there at 3 am. Her car proudly parked in the driveway and her ex's car on the dirt like he knew she was coming.
I snapped a photo, immediately sent it and said I'm done come get your shit. 

20 minutes later she responds with a call ""I'll be home soon"" is all she said. Didn't let me talk and hung up.

Now here is where I may have overreacted, when I got home I immediately grabbed new trash bags and put her clothes in them. Her iPads, her medicine everything that was easy I chucked in. I had 8 bags full by the time she got back. 
Stars yelling that I'm misunderstanding and she didn't do anything! Like wtf? She kept yelling that she was only over there to see the dog but come on. Not only did she see him before work but Sunday evening we usually take him for a walk together!
I wasn't having any of it, I ignored the obvious implication of what her being there for 2 hours at 3 am meant. I asked her if she sees anything wrong with what she did. If she thinks I'm some kind of idiot. The only thing said was ""I wanted to see the dog (dogs name hidden)"" 

To today (Sunday) I woke up, went to town and got a few plastic tubs with lids to put her stuff in. When she eventually woke up, she didn't say much again.
""I guess I need to go find a place to live"", ""ok!"" I replied. 
Guess where she went to ask to move back into?! Yep. Her ex. The same place I helped move her out from 3 years ago...

A friend of both ours showed me a message she got from my ex this morning, saying the same thing about ""wanting to see the dog"" but then also said ""I had to ask him last night if I'd be able to move back in""... 

So, have I over reacted? I don't think I did but I'll admit I'm sad af right now and questioning myself. Attached is the pic I snapped.

1ogf85y,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1ogf85y/is_he_interested_in_me/,Is he interested in me?,"It’s been a couple of days since I met a guy during a study trip. He and I immediately got along and joked a lot about everything. The last four days were when I started to feel something between us. One of those days we spent together with the others at the beach and at a sushi restaurant, where he had never been before — he even asked me for advice. At the beach, he made everyone wait 10 minutes just so I could get my swimsuit, which another guy had borrowed.

One day, while we were coming back from a group outing, he and I fell behind to talk alone about relationships and dating. He told me about a girl he used to talk to and how things ended between them. I listened and gave him my opinion. Then we started talking about homosexuality, and he said he supports it and isn’t homophobic.

When we got back home, we went to sleep, and the next day he called me to see if I was running late. That day we spent time joking and playing together on the school’s sports field with the others. We ate in the same place and kept teasing each other. Then he asked me, away from everyone else, to come with him to find a bathroom, so we were alone for a while. We talked about how some people on this trip wanted to start relationships or just hook up, and we agreed that things should go slowly and not be rushed. We stayed alone a bit longer, then took a short walk to rejoin the others.

That evening, we all went out together (both those from our study group and the host students) and had some drinks. It was a great night, but at some point, after I had a bit to drink, I started crying over love. When he saw me, he asked me to go for a walk alone with him to calm down. We stayed by ourselves for about 30 minutes, and he said the most beautiful things I’ve ever heard about what I was going through (I had been seeing a guy who said he liked me but didn’t really show it — and since the beginning of that trip, I’d actually been interested in him). I explained everything without revealing that I’m gay. He comforted me, and we talked for a while. Then I asked if we could get a bottle of water; he came with me to a bar, lied about our ages, and bought me a Coke — he paid for it without saying anything.

When we left, we rejoined the others, but he found another excuse for us to be alone again, taking a different street to go somewhere else for drinks. After spending the evening like that, we went home around 3 a.m., and he told me that even though he was exhausted, he’d stay awake and that I could text him. And so I did — we talked until around 4 or 4:30 a.m.

The next day (the last one), we were supposed to go out with the group. When he saw no one was ready, I told him that the guy hosting me didn’t want to go out, and he said, “I’m going out anyway — if you want, we can go together.” That didn’t seem weird since we were supposed to meet the others. In the end, we went to a supermarket, bought croissants, water, and coffee — and again he paid for me, saying it wasn’t a problem and I didn’t owe him anything. We had breakfast together, just the two of us, and spent about half an hour alone.

At the airport, we didn’t talk as much, but when he saw me sad about leaving, he hugged me and asked if I wanted to look around the shops together. He also said he’d get the same drink as me from Starbucks. On the plane, he kept checking on me and tried in every way to help charge my phone, worrying about me. On the bus ride home, I started crying again, and he jokingly called me “his man” while hugging me, as he had done several times before.

I don’t really know how to interpret all of this. We’re no longer on the trip, so we won’t see each other often, but we live in the same city. Throughout all this, he’s given me lots of compliments, and I feel like there might be something between us — but at the same time, he used to be in a relationship with a girl, and he said he wasn’t gay but not in a direct way it was related to a joke we made about a thing, but i think he could be bisexual also because while talking about a talking stage he had with someone he used almost always neutral for when talking about “this person “ and sometimes he used the male gender too - recently was joking around with a girl from the trip (I think just as friends, though).
