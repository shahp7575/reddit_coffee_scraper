1hzpy30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1hzpy30/favorite_chicken_broth/,Favorite chicken broth,"Swanson's ""Bone Broth Chicken"" is better than their other products, and far better than most other store-bought broths.  It's a little more expensive, but if you read the nutrition label, it contains four to eight TIMES more protein, suggesting that it's made with way more actual chicken.  I would believe that, since it thickens when refrigerated, unlike other broths/stocks I've bought.  So, you could actually mix two or three cups of this with a cup of water and still have a ""better"" broth than the cheaper versions, and minimize the cost difference.

It also has a very genuine, clean flavor.  I would be happy to drink it out of a coffee mug, unlike most similar products.  In fact, I use it several times a week to make a protein shake in combination with whey protein powder and greek yogurt.  Not as weird-tasting as it sounds: my shake's flavor profile is in the cream of chicken soup family...

Toxic Rats: Alejandro, Dawn, Noah, Shawn, Tyler

Episode 6: Runaway Model

""Previously, on Total Drama Revenge of the Island! The campers went deep in an underwater scavenger hunt.""

""Tyler, Noah, and Alejandro formed an alliance to take down either Shawn or Dawn, and Lindsay got more confirmation about her crush on Mike thanks to Dawn.""

""And when the Maggots lost the water skiing challenge, Axel tricked Mike into thinking that Cameron blabbed to her about his disorder, which caused them to convince Lindsay to toss away Cameron as well.""

""It's now Team Maggot versus Team Rat,"" Chris said, the Rats' logo appearing on-screen against a radiant golden background. The logo rotated around into the Maggots' logo, and a four-way split-screen of the Maggots' remaining members rose up from the background – Lindsay in the upper left against a brownish-red backdrop; Mike in the upper right against dark blue; Emma in the bottom left against turquoise; and Axel in the bottom right against yellow. ""Will the Maggots man up before all their men are down? Let's hope not,"" Chris said as the scene cut to him standing at the end of the dock with Chef. ""There's nothing more entertaining than a man down.”

As if on cue, the wood under Chef started to creak and crack, breaking away and sending Chef plunging into the lake with a startled scream. Chris laughed. ""More where that came from, right now, on Total! Drama! Revenge of the Island!""

(Theme Song)

The sun was already high in the sky as the episode opened, and a loon cried out in the distance as the camera panned down onto Mike looking rather distressed outside the communal bathroom. The theater boy knocked on the door and asked ""Are you girls finished yet?""

""Just about done!"" Emma called out as the camera cut to the inside of the bathroom. The mirror on the back wall was too cracked and smudged to use, the trash can was grimy, and the strip of fly paper hanging in the corner was in need of a change, but nevertheless Axel, Lindsay, and Emma were still gathered along the countertop – the survivalist sitting on the far left; the dumb blonde happily painting her nails; and the preppy girl brushing her hair.

""This is definitely the right color for me right now,"" Lindsay said, finishing up and admiring her left hand. ""Don't you think so?"" she asked Emma.

""Yeah, it looks great on you,"" Emma answered happily.

Confessional: Emma

""Being friends with Lindsay is really nice,"" Emma confessed. ""Most of the students in the prep school that I go to are all serious and unable to let loose. I get having to stay focused and not break the rules, but all of that made me feel like an outsider when compared to this island of all places.""

Confessional Ends

""Axel, you should totally let me do your nails next,"" Lindsay offered, taking the latina's hand. She looked more closely at it, and added ""And maybe give you a manicure too. You could use one.""

Axel yanked her hand away. ""I'm not into frilly girl care,"" she told her teammate. ""It won't hold up when you're in survivor mode. Besides, I'm already happy with the look I've got.""

""Deep,"" Lindsay nodded, Emma doing the same as well.

The scene flashed to the Rats' cabin, a fast-paced chiptune began to play as Shawn said ""So who's ready to go out there and kick the Maggots’ butts for the second time in a row?"" The shot cut inside to show him addressing his teammates, who were standing by a bunk. ""We did it before and we'll do it again!""

""What's got you so fired up?"" Noah asked dryly. ""I figured with a few days having passed you'd get over your old teammates voting you off.""

""I'm not upset about that anymore,"" Shawn responded. ""It was all in the game, and I just want to make sure that you guys know you have my support.""

""Ohh. Why didn't you say so earlier?"" Tyler asked.

""I thought you'd already known,"" Shawn answered. ""Just be ready to give the next challenge all we got. To Team Rat!"" he declared, putting his hand down in front of him.

""Team Rat,"" the rest of his team said as they put their hands on top of his.

""Cool,"" Shawn smiled. ""I'm gonna go hunt for some food. You guys do whatever you need too,"" he said and sprinted out.

""I do need to get back to collecting,"" Dawn said and made her way out the cabin.

""I just need to find someplace quiet enough to read,"" Noah shrugged and left with his book.

Tyler moved to leave the cabin, but was stopped by Alejandro. ""What's wrong Alejandro?"" he asked.

“We both know that we're in an alliance with Noah, but I know that one of us will have to go if we lose three challenges in a row,” Alejandro said.

""And you want to take out Noah?"" Tyler asked.

“Correct,” Alejandro nodded. “He is lacking in physical strength, and his intellect can overpower both of our talents if he stays on.”

""Yeah, I guess that makes sense,"" Tyler replied.

Confessional: Tyler

""I’ve been starting to get along with Noah now, but Al totally has a point here,"" Tyler explained. ""Most of the past contestants that make it far in the game are geniuses, and it would damage my standing with my hockey team if I got eliminated thanks to one.""

Confessional Ends

The whining ring as the scene cut to a shot of one of the island's loudspeakers heralded a broadcast from the host. ""Iiiit's challenge time!"" he began. ""Campers~! Meet me on the other side of the island~!"" he announced in an almost sing-song voice.

The footage immediately skipped ahead to the nine teens already nearly assembled on two sets of low bleachers in a clearing lined with a handful of stage and spotlights. The four Maggots were seated on the stands to the right of the camera, while Mike was just now filing in with his teammates on the left.

""Hey, Lindsay. Really like your hair,"" Mike greeted as he sat down. “Is your color natural or did you dye it?”

""My friends bleached it during a game of truth or dare and I liked it enough to never change it,"" Lindsay replied.

""Any sign of Chris yet?” Axel asked her team. “I wanna know what he expects us to do so I can figure out our winning strategy.""

""Not yet,"" Emma answered before a sudden and rather trendy tune caught their attention.

The perspective inverted to reveal that the two teams had gathered before a large stage and runway, complete with a short catwalk and a large curtained-off backstage area. Chef was already waiting in the pink dress he'd worn to ceremonies back in season two, and Chris shortly joined him by way of descending from above with his jetpack. The host was wearing a sharp gray suit and fashionable glasses with tinted lens, but more noticeable were the changes to his hair – it was now pure white and long enough for him to sport a short ponytail.

Chef walked up as he landed and took the jetpack of his back, then walked away as Chris smiled. ""Welcome to your challenge,"" he opened, ""the Weird and Wild Fashion Spectacular!"" He took a paper fan out of his breast pocket and waved it a bit.

""Ooh, I love fashion!"" Lindsay squealed, clapping eagerly. ""This is so my challenge.”

""Fashion is a complete waste of time if you ask me,"" Axel said.

""Which explains why you're dressed in mens' camo pants,"" Emma snarked.

""You won't be walking the catwalk,"" Chris started to fan himself, ""no-no-no-no. No amount of fashion can help you people.""

""You don't say?"" Shawn mumbled to himself.

""Here's how it's gonna work,"" Chris continued. ""Each team gets a wardrobe of clothes,"" the camera cut to a dresser, clothes rack, and several pieces of luggage on the side of the stage, ""a makeup kit, and ten minutes to dress and make up a model."" Chef held up an hourglass and glared mutely at the camera. ""Which, you'll send down the runway,"" the shot zoomed in on the host's fan as he walked his fingers across it, ""to be judged by myself, Chef, and today's Total Drama classic competitor, Anne Maria!""

The shot cut back to the wardrobe pile as the smallest case lying on the stage opened up and the Jersey girl rose up out of it. ""Thanks! It was getting real stuffy in there,"" Anne Maria said, waving to the camera as she stepped out of the suitcase.

Confessional: Lindsay

""Cool!"" Lindsay squealed. ""We get to meet a real model!""

Confessional Ends

""I can wait to see the model!"" Lindsay exclaimed.

""Uh-huh,"" Chris said, scraping some white powder off his shoulder with his fan. ""Right after you catch one.""

""That doesn't sound too hard,"" Axel said. ""They'll pass out after two or three steps given how they eat.""

""Did I say human models?"" Chris corrected, fanning himself again as he walked across the stage. ""Don't think so! No, your models are in there!"" He thrust his finger off to the right, forcing Anne Maria to duck under his arm. The camera quick-panned to the woods just as an earth-shattering roar shook the area.

""They're wild! They're mutated!"" Chris told the campers, the camera moving behind his back. ""And like me, they despise teenagers."" The five Rats were shown looking shocked and concerned.

""Okay fashionistas,"" the host said in a campy accent, ""go!"" He blew his airhorn again, and the campers ran off.

The footage flashed ahead to a trail in the woods, Shawn searching behind a rock and Emma looking at a bush in the background while Mike and Axel walked by in the foreground. The camera panned to the right and stopped on Alejandro and Dawn, who were warily looking upwards.

Something croaked above them and the shot cut to a small frog, seemingly normal aside from an eye stalk on the top of its head, sitting on a branch. With a grunt of effort, Tyler pounced on it from the right, and smiled when he opened his hands and saw he'd caught it. Unfortunately for him, the mutant frog produced an odd noise and flash of light, blinking out of sight but quickly reappearing on top of the confused young man's head. With another noise and flash of light, it disappeared, this time bringing Tyler with it, and they blinked back into existence in mid-air a few yards away. Tyler screamed as he started to fall, and the mutant frog teleported away to presumed safety before its failed assailant landed with a crash on the forest floor.

In another part of the forest, Lindsay was looking around absentmindedly while approaching what appeared to be a gigantic turtle shell, a short and spiky tail poking out of one end. The girl sat down on the shell and started pursing her lips in thought, but gasped when the tail suddenly wrapped around her leg and pulled her inside the shell. The beast inside growled and stood up, its stout legs and turtle head popping out of the shell's holes...along with Lindsay. With another growl, the mutant punched her away, and she landed in a heap with a pained groan.

The camera cut next to what appeared to be an ordinary beaver sitting perfectly still just at the edge of a bush. Mike rose grinning from another bush in the background, then pounced upon it. His jubilation quickly faded into confusion as the unmoving beaver was somehow lifted up by its tail, taking Mike with it...

The shot cut outward to reveal the beaver has no more than a lure of a large bipedal anglerfish-like monster, which promptly roared. Axel, who was standing nearby, promptly gasped and ran away, and was soon followed by Mike and the angler mutant.

Another flash moved the focus to a close-up of a slice of pepperoni pizza, lying on the ground in the middle of a loop of rope that led off to the left. ""Pizza? What's this doing here?"" Noah said, the camera zooming out to show him looking down at it. He looked up and tilted his head, and the shot cut over to none other than Fang not quite hidden behind a tree, an axe in one hand and the anchored rope of his snare trap in the other.

Noah knew what was going to happen, but decided to have a little fun. ""Too bad there's pepperoni on the slice, otherwise I'd eat it,"" he said loud enough for the shark to hear as he walked off.

Fang palmed his face and walked over to the slice and started picking the toppings off of it. Meanwhile, Noah used his shark tooth to cut the rope of the snare.

The effect was instant. Fang was hoisted up in the air by his wrist, and Noah came over to where the pizza was. ""My mistake! I don't eat food that's been on the floor!"" He chuckled and left, the shark growling at him as he was hung up.

The scene cut abruptly to a massive mutant brawl between a massive two-headed rabbit, two spiny woolly beavers, and a hairless squirrel zapping them with its eye-lasers from a nearby branch. The camera panned left as a giant hermit crab scuttled up and snapped its claws, with Axel, Lindsay, and Mike watching from behind a bush in the background with wide eyes.

""So...which one do we use?"" Mike asked.

""Definitely not the rabbit,"" Lindsay replied.

A whine signaled the loudspeaker turning on once again, and soon enough Chris's announcement rang through the air. ""Five minutes, people!""

""Hey guys!"" Emma quickly followed, directing her teammates' attention to their right. ""Why don't we use that slimy maggot?"" she asked, the shot cutting to close-up of a small green caterpillar happily chewing on a leaf atop a fallen log. ""The one that's the size of a beagle,"" Emma clarified, the camera pulling back to reveal the much larger maggot standing nearby. It promptly vomited up a puddle of green fluid.

""It'd be easy to catch,"" she explained, the camera cutting to all four Maggots standing in a row, ""and dress. We could just slide it down the runway.""

""Excellent idea, Emma,"" Axel said with a sly grin.

""Stand back,"" Emma told everybody and went towards the maggot's direction. ""I have an idea for the fashion style.""

""Okay, did anybody find anything we can catch?"" Dawn asked her teammates, the Rats now hunkering down behind a bush.

""Not really,"" Tyler said. ""But honestly, I don't think any of the animals out here would look that good in human clothes to begin with. Y'know, since they're not human.""

""So...if we want something that's human-like,"" Alejandro said thoughtfully with a brief look around, ""then what about him?"" He stood up and pointed over the bush, and the shot cut to none other than Sasquatchanakwa walking into a cave, oblivious to the teens watching him.

""Maybe, but how are we gonna catch him?"" Noah asked.

Shawn smirked. ""Leave it to me,"" he told his teammates.

The scene flashed back to the stage as Shawn dug through the wardrobe on the stage, taking articles of clothing and stuffing them into a duffel bag.

""So what exactly is your plan?"" Dawn asked, watching her teammate.

""I'm a trap master. I've built lots of traps for zombies back home, and I have an eye for detail from my bakery job. I can put together a trap, and get the yeti dressed,"" Shawn said, examining a hat and then putting it in the bag, closing the bag with a finalized zip.

Noah raised an eyebrow. ""Are you sure this is gonna work?""

Shawn nodded. ""Positive. If I can catch that yeti, what can't I catch?""

“We could use more chic,” Tyler said until an idea came to him and he grinned. “And I know just who to talk to.”

The scene immediately flashed away to the Maggots where their own maggot has been dressed by Emma.

""This rat looks ready to party and have fun!"" Emma described her choice as the maggot was wearing a black collared shirt, a brown cap, and a black chain necklace.

The maggot expressed its dislike of the party style by vomiting onto the floor.

""Seems the maggot isn't a big fan of the choice of fashion,"" Mike said.

A sudden ringing got the team's attention, and Chris announced ""Three minutes remaining!"" over an unseen loudspeaker.

""Let me take care of this,"" Lindsay offered. “I am a fashion expert.”

A fair distance away from where the Maggots had been preparing their model, Chris lounged in a chair under an umbrella, watching as Dakota rolled barrels of toxic waste around and drinking some pink lemonade out of a coconut cup.

""Dakota!"" Chris mockingly called. ""When you're done cleaning up the environment, could you get me another drink? Thanks!""

Dakota groaned, and continued rolling the barrel to where it was supposed to go until Tyler ran over to her.

""Hey! Dakota!"" Tyler exclaimed. ""Can I help you with what you’re doing?""

“Aww, you’re such a gentleman,” Dakota gushed, and continued pushing the barrel with Tyler’s help.

“Do you think you could give me some fashion tips?” Tyler asked. “Even when you’re working with toxic waste, you’re still as pretty as ever.”

“You want my advice? Really?” Dakota smiled, the two of them pausing their progress. “No one ever asks me for my advice! Sure, I'd be happy to help!” she said and grabbed Tyler and pulled him closer to her. “Okay. This is major top secret. Like, three whole seasons ahead secret.”

The heiress got to Tyler’s ear and whispered “Stripes. They are so on trend.”

""Stripes! Got it!"" Tyler declared victoriously. ""I wish you were still in the game, Dakota!"" He started to run away, and Dakota blushed a little when she heard the compliment.

The scene flashed back to the Maggots, the camera positioned close to Lindsay's face but focused on her three teammates behind her. The camera zoomed out as they watched her tighten a piece of cloth over their rat model.

""That should be about it,"" Lindsay said. ""Me and my friends tend to design clothes during our sleepovers.""

""It's not bad, Lindsay,"" Emma started to say.

""I think you did a wonderful job,"" Mike critiqued.

Another ringing got their attention, and they looked up towards an unseen loudspeaker as Chris announced ""One minute!""

""It's good enough,"" Axel declared. ""Let's get back to Chris.""

The scene flashed back to the Rats hiding behind a rock near Sasquatchanakwa's cave.

""This DDD is ready for action,"" Noah held up the bag.

""What does it stand for exactly?"" Tyler asked him.

""Detonating Duffel Bag,"" Noah made it more clear before tossing the bag over to Tyler. ""Go long!""

Tyler ran towards the cave with the bag in hand as the scene cut to the inside. Sasquatchanakwa was sitting in a wooden armchair, drinking a can of soda and watching some jaunty-themed show on an old television set when Shawn's bag landed in his lap. With a curious grunt, he looked at the bag.

That's when the explosion happened, and when it did, the yeti let out a frightening roar, scaring the Rats.

""That doesn't sound good!"" Dawn panicked.

The scene cut to a spotlight as it turned on; then a couple stage lights turning on as well; then a mutant squirrel hopping up next to a book-reading bear which lowered its book to reveal its three eyes, both animals looking at something curiously; then the stage and catwalk, Chris front and center with Chef and Anne Maria – the former in sort of rapper-ish outfit with a red tracksuit and hat, earphones, and gold chains – sitting at the judge's table.

""It's freaky forest fashion time!"" Chris announced. ""Maggoteers,"" he turned and pointed his fan backstage, ""show me somethin' fierce."" The four Maggots walked out on stage, Axel and Emma on the left with Lindsay and Mike on the right.

""Chef, drop that needle!"" Chris commanded next, the shot cutting to a close-up of a record turntable as the needle was dropped onto the spinning disc and a trendy tune began to play. The camera zoomed out, and Chef gave the host and campers a thumbs-up.

""This plus-sized maggot is wearing a fresh, popstar fashion style like no one else's,"" Emma began smoothly, pointing to the gap between her and Lindsay as their model slowly moved out. It was wearing a pink wig and a purple dress with white stripes. The camera followed it as it slid along, Emma continuing her piece all the while. ""Her pink hair matches well with her diva attitude and her dress screams fame."" She finished with a grimace.

""A bit typical and overly glamorous,"" Chris said as the maggot reached the end of the catwalk. ""I give it an 8.5,"" the host announced as he held up a placard with his score.

The Maggots shouted cheers of victory.

Chef held up an 8.0.

""Hmm,"" Anne Maria said in between the two grown men, pursing her lips and holding up a 7.3 to the immediate cheering of the Maggots. ""It looks surprisingly good on the maggot,"" Anne Maria explained as the two men looked at her.

""Fair enough,"" Chris said tersely, looking back towards the catwalk. ""Show me what you've got, Rats!"" he called out, the trendy music resuming as the shot cut back to the stage, showing it utterly empty. The camera zoomed in and the music kept playing, but for several more seconds, there was still no movement backstage. ""...Rats?"" Chris called out again and finally Tyler ran out from behind the curtain with a frightened scream. He was quickly followed by Shawn, Alejandro, and then Noah. ""The Rats present a style from decades ago!""

""Please cooperate with us!"" Dawn insisted behind the curtain. She soon emerged… on Sasquatchanakwa's shoulders, trying to steer him out onto the stage.

Sasquatchanakwa wore a horizontally striped shirt and bell bottom pants that the legs had no extra flowing room.

""Originating from the 70's, the shirt is an explosion of color, and the pants-"" Tyler tried to explain.

""Wah!"" Dawn yelped as the yeti threw her off, and then started swatting at the rest of the team.

""The pants had enough leg room to perfectly fit his thick legs!"" Tyler finished before Sasquatchanakwa grabbed him and held him over him.

The music stopped, and Sasquatchanakwa finally noticed the three judges just as the first one spoke up. ""That model is huge,"" Anne Maria said, cringing at the sight of the model before her.

Sasquatchanakwa looked down at his outfit, and that was when Dakota came over.

“Ew, horizontal stripes?” Dakota criticized. “Tyler, I meant vertical stripes. Horizontals just make you look fat!”

“They do?” Tyler felt dumbfounded, and Sasquatchanakwa looked down at his shirt to find his belly becoming pudgy.

""True. It hardly complements the Yeti's husky physique,"" Chris added.

Another trendy tune started playing and was soon joined by the flashing of cameras, the shot cutting back to the catwalk to show a group of men taking pictures of the model.

“Hey, what are you guys doing?” Dakota yelled and stomped her foot. “I called you here to take pictures of me!”

The paparazzi continued, and soon the constant flashes began to irritate the subject of their attention. Sasquatchanakwa threw Tyler away, rubbed his eyes, and growled in ever-increasing anger, then tore off his clothing as the shot cut away to the judges. ""Uh,"" Anne Maria asked Chef, ""should we give our scores or-""

She was cut off when the yeti suddenly reached forward and grabbed her by the head, yanking her out of her seat with a startled yelp. The shot zoomed out as an engine whirred to life, revealing that Sasquatchanakwa had also commandeered Chris's jetpack. With the captive tanned woman in his arms, he took off into the air.

""Hey, he took my jetpack!"" Chris quickly and angrily protested. The shot cut back to the ape-man and tanned woman as Anne Maria screamed, and Saquatchanakwa flew off to the foggy and ominous crags of Boney Island.

""Uh-huh...,"" Chris said blankly, still fanning himself. ""Will Anne Maria survive?"" he asked the camera, lifting up his shades. ""And am I legally liable if she doesn't? Find out, after the break.""

(Commercial Break)

""What do you mean I'm liable if the yeti eats Anne Maria?"" Chris asked frantically, his cellphone now against his ear while he continued to fan himself. ""It's not my fault she's delicious!"" The camera zoomed out to show the host on the Dock of Shame, the two teams watching him intently a few feet away. ""Gotta go,"" he quickly told the person he was talking to, quickly transitioning into a laugh as he turned his attention back to the campers.

""He-he-hey! For our next challenge, the two teams will...,"" he paused to think, ""compete to rescue Anne Maria!"" he announced, causing the campers to share confused and disbelieving looks with one another. ""Yup, that's it! Everyone grab a canoe and head to Boney Island!"" The campers promptly ran off down the dock, leaving Chris to laugh nervously. ""It's all good!"" he reassured himself.

The scene flashed ahead to the two teams rowing across the lake, the Maggots in a red canoe in the background with the Rats in green in the fore.

""So, turns out using a sasquatch as our model was a bad idea,"" Alejandro griped from the front of their canoe.

""Hey,"" Shawn said, sitting behind him. ""It's not like we were expecting the sasquatch to kidnap Anne Maria.""

""It's a giant rampaging ape-man,"" Noah shot back behind Dawn and in front of Tyler. ""There was no way that would've ended well.""

""We would have been better off finding a creature small enough,"" Dawn suggested.

“And Tyler, thanks so much for the fashion tips,” Noah said sarcastically.

""I didn't know that horizontal stripes were out of style,"" Tyler shot back.

“We're entering the next part of the challenge, so everybody stop arguing,” Dawn ordered as they entered into a fog bank.

The fog moved away as the shot cut to the island they were approaching, the skull-shaped mountain looming ominously as hollow, whooping cries echoed across the water.

A seamless cut ahead took the scene to Axel, Shawn, and Dawn running through the slightly-barren woods of Boney Island one right after the other. ""Anne Maria! Where are you?"" Shawn called, and the camera zoomed in on Dawn's rather blank but thoughtful look.

Confessional: Dawn

“I did say that I wouldn't do anything about not having any allies, but there is a possibility of my team losing today, and I'll need someone I can count on who's as purposely lonely as me,” Dawn mused.

Confessional Ends

Shawn was shown running along with worry in his eyes, and the camera panned back to Dawn as she sharply cleared her throat. Shawn didn't show any reaction, so Dawn frowned then made a louder ""A-hem!""

Hearing that one, Shawn looked back and promptly slowed down as Dawn ran up closer to him. ""Dawn?"" the theorist raised an eyebrow. ""Why are you stopping me?""

""I feel like we should talk about our positions on the team,"" Dawn said.

“What about it?” Shawn asked.

""I'm the only girl right now, and you swapped to us after the third challenge,"" Dawn brought up. “It's highly possible that one of us will be eliminated should we lose.”

""I know that to be true, but I don't do alliances,"" Shawn said back. “And no offense, but you creep everybody out with your aura readings.”

""I had no idea about that. I'm not the most socially adept person,"" Dawn replied. ""Just help me with voting off Alejandro. I've sensed that he's not as thoughtful as he seems to be.""

""I'm not sure about him being evil, but I'll help with the vote,"" Shawn said as he walked ahead. ""And it's not like I've formed any bonds with him.""

The camera panned to the left, where Alejandro had been listening to their conversation a few feet back with a smirk.

Confessional: Alejandro

""So it appears that Dawn has been catching up to me,"" Alejandro told the confessional. ""I was going to boot Shawn off first, but he can wait while I deal with this aura whisperer.""

Confessional Ends

The scene skipped ahead again, showing Noah coming to a halt with Shawn, Dawn, and Axel right behind him. ""Guys!"" he called out panting, pointing up and ahead. ""The sasquatch!"" The camera panned up and ahead to a cliff with scaffolding set up on its face and Sasquatachanakwa sitting with Anne Maria at the top.

""So the retro look didn't work for you,"" Anne Maria said, patting the sulking ape-man on the back. ""That doesn't mean you're hideous! I can rock the retro style, but you just have to find something that fits you."" As she spoke, the yeti rubbed the tears from his eyes and looked at her.

""So what's with the scaffolding?"" Emma asked, the camera cutting back to ground-level to show that the rest of the cast had arrived.

""I'm turning Boney Island into my personal resort,"" Chris explained as he, Chef, and Dakota arrived. ""The Health Department said it was unfit for human life, but, I sent in workers anyway,"" he continued, the cast giving each other incredulous looks. ""Hmm...wonder where they went?"" the host asked with an oddly sly smile.

A flash took the focus to a gruesome scene of human bones and workers' clothes scattered around some rocks in the forest. The camera panned to the right along gnawing sounds, and a trio of woolly beavers coming into view chewing on bones and wearing hard hats and pouring out a cup of hot coffee from a thermos.

""Don't hurt him!"" Anne Maria called down to the campers. ""He just has some big hairy body issues he's working through!""

""My four brothers can learn a thing or two from that guy,"" Axel nodded to herself before noticing the others staring at her. She quickly cleared her throat, then looked up at the clifftop. ""I mean, did you hear that?! He's got issues! We have to take that yeti out!"" she declared.

""Leave that to me!"" Tyler smirked, walking forward and picking up a sledgehammer off the ground. He spun it around, then let it go and watched as it flew up and hit Sasquatchanakwa in the eye. The yeti quickly rubbed where he'd been hit, then lowered his hand and growled, revealing the black eye he now sported.

""How'd you like that?"" Tyler taunted up at him. This only angered the sasquatch even more, causing him to jump up and down in such a rage that Tyler was shocked.

Confessional: Shawn

""Yep,"" Shawn told the outhouse camera with wide eyes, ""insulting the four-hundred-pound yeti was a bad idea.""

The raging ape-man jumped across the clifftop, his landings shaking through the stone and causing parts of the scaffolding to come lose – the right side of the top level, then the left side of the next, then right side of the level below that, and the left side of the very bottom level providing a convenient series of ramps up the side of the cliff. He then picked up the sledgehammer that had hit him and chucked it at Tyler, knocking him out.

The camera cut to the rest of the Rats, its members huddled together. ""Here is our plan. There are four poles holding up the scaffolding and four of us. Noah, Shawn, and I will climb the poles to draw the yeti's attention,” Alejandro discussed. “Dawn can run up the platforms and comfort it since she has animal expertise.""

""What about Tyler?"" Dawn pointed to the sleeping boy.

""Let him rest until he regains consciousness,"" Noah said. ""He got hit pretty badly.”

""Team Rat, let's stop that yeti!"" Shawn declared, the four running off.

""How are we gonna rescue Anne Maria before they do?"" Mike asked as the focus cut over to the Maggots watching their rivals put their plan into action.

""Why don't we use someone prettier than Anne Maria to lure the yeti away?"" Emma suggested.

""In that case, we should use Lindsay,"" Mike declared. ""She is the prettiest girl on the island.""

""That I do agree with,"" Lindsay smiled briefly, ""but I can't run up in these boots.""

Axel interrupted the discussion by clearing her throat. ""Lindsay, Emma, I'm going in,"" she commanded. ""Bring out your beauty supplies and don't think twice.""

The three shared a wary look.

Confessional: Axel

""I got Cameron eliminated last episode, and I have knowledge of Mike’s DID,"" Axel confessed. ""However, that won't be enough to secure my spot in the merge. I'm gonna prove to my team that I'm worth keeping, even if it means putting on makeup.""

Confessional Ends

""Go Team Rat!"" Shawn called as he, Noah, Alejandro, and Dawn were shown beginning their ascent, the boys climbing up the scaffolding's support beams while Dawn took the scaffolding itself. Sasquatchanakwa quickly noticed the team and picked up a barrel from a nearby pile, then tossed a barrel at Shawn, then Dawn. Both contestants let out pained grunts and the camera cut to the sasquatch as he threw a third and fourth barrel, Alejandro and Noah letting out grunts of their own. The camera cut to Alejandro and Noah as they landed on top of their other teammates.

The camera focused on Tyler as he woke up from his unconscious state. ""What the?"" he wondered as he saw his teammates on the ground in pain and looked up to see Sasquatchanakwa holding Anne Maria captive. ""So it seems they tried to do the challenge, but were unlucky."" He stood up and developed a determined grin.

""This will be my challenge to shine!"" the klutz whooped before running up the scaffolding.

The Rats got up in time to see their tracksuit clad teammate run up to Sasquatchanakwa. ""Wow. Klutzo's going for it,"" Noah sighted him.

Tyler saw the barrels coming his way and jumped above all of them.

""Tyler, look out,"" Dakota warned him.

Tyler saw a mallet in his path and picked it up. ""Thanks for letting me know!"" He continued to run, only this time, he was smashing the barrels with the mallet.

""Okay, you're sure this will make me look good, right?"" Axel asked with a hint of skepticism in her voice as the scene cut to the Maggots, the survivalist's back to the camera as Lindsay got to work with a powder puff in one hand and a makeup brush in the other. Emma and Mike watched with variable interest behind the dumb blonde. ""Because I don't want to get all made-up like this only to have it not work,"" Axel added.

""Yep,"" Lindsay reassured her. ""I'm not saying that you look bad now, but you just need a little boost here or there.""

""Hurry! Tyler's making good time!"" Mike urged. ""Aw, man, we're never gonna-""

He then gasped and became Chester. ""Oh, for the love of Pete!"" the old man cried. ""You're not painting the Sistine Chapel. It's just makeup!""

Chester pushed Lindsay to the side, grabbed some of the makeup, and started applying it to Axel's face. ""Step aside! Dang fool kids. Just get some rouge on her and there!"" Chester said as he did Axel's face. ""Done!”

""Finally!"" Axel said in relief. Lindsay gasped in shock and Shawn, who was merely passing by, took a look at her and ran away screaming in terror.

Axel puffed up proudly. ""I must look good. Hey yeti!"" she called out as the camera showed her from the neck down walking away. ""Prepare to be amazed!""

""Axel, I really think you need to-"" Emma tried to tell her but was ignored.

""Relax,"" Axel told her. ""That yeti is going to be taken aback!""

Mike had now returned to his current state. “Wow! What did you guys do to Axel?” he wondered.

""You were the one who interrupted my makeup!"" Lindsay replied in a surprising anger that took Mike aback.

Meanwhile, Tyler had reached the top but was looking much more tired than before. He was covered in sweat and was only able to drag his mallet behind him. The yeti threw another barrel at him, and he jumped over and plummeted on his face.

""I could... really use a... nutrition bar right now..."" Tyler weakly said.

""Tyler! You need to win for us!"" Dawn yelled up to him.

""Go and rescue Anne Maria!"" Alejandro motivated.

""You can do it Tyler!"" Dakota cheered.

Tyler got up from the ground and ran at Sasquatchanakwa with a battle cry… only for the yeti to stop him in his tracks by grabbing his head and effortlessly tossed him off the scaffolding, resulting in him landing in front of the Rats with a thud.

""Are you gonna be okay?"" Noah asked.

Tyler got his head up. ""I'm fine-kay!"" he mumbled goofily.

A flash took the focus back to the top just as Axel ran on to the scene, finally revealing the new look Chester had given her – which amounted to large amounts of blue crayon as eye shadow and the bottom half of her face a swirl of red and green lipstick.

""Uhh...hey there...big yeti...,"" Axel said awkwardly. ""How's it like being... tall?""

Anne Maria and Sasquatchanakwa stared at the made-up girl. ""That right there is another thing you shouldn't do,"" the tanned girl said to the ape-man before they burst into fits of laughter.

""Okay. I'm done here!"" Axel scowled, running forward to the surprise of the two non-competitors. She suddenly and swiftly kicked Sasquatchanakwa between the legs, sending him flying off the scaffolding.

Dakota helped Tyler off the floor. ""Those were some pretty great moves up there.""

""Most people just see me as a failure in almost everything, but I do love receiving credit from you,"" Tyler said before Sasquatchanakwa fell down at the spot he was just in.

""Team Maggot, you've got immunity,"" Chris announced as he flew up with his jetpack, and the Maggots on the ground cheered.

""Aww!"" Shawn griped as the camera panned to the disappointed faces of him and the Rats.

Anne Maria was currently applying makeup to herself while holding her mirror until Axel snatched it from her. She gasped, and then looked down at Mike. ""I would be mad, but I'm just glad this is all over.""

""Time to head back to camp,"" Chris said, ""Rats,"" the shot cut down to them as they shared a nervous look, ""you've got some voting to do.”",1,1736698098.0,u_xtremexavier15,0,1.0,False

I'm writing this message in case someone has gone through something similar and has any ideas I could try. There are seasons in my life when I sleep much worse than usual. And with each passing year, those periods seem to get longer.

I’m someone with good habits:  
I don’t smoke, I don’t drink, I eat healthily, I exercise every day, I spend time outdoors getting sunlight, I have an early dinner and leave 2-3 hours between my last meal and bedtime. I even use red glasses at night to block blue light. I work as a programmer and spend a lot of time in front of the computer. Since I’m self-employed, I’m trying to make a living by building my own projects. I often find it hard to step away from the computer because I love learning and creating things in general. But I don’t feel stressed about it, nor do I think I overwork (I put in a maximum of 8 hours a day).

In general, I sleep quite well (around 8 hours a day), but during those difficult periods, my main issue isn’t falling asleep — I can do that easily by reading a book — but waking up in the middle of the night. Sometimes I can go back to sleep, and other times I can’t.

I’ve tried several things I’ve read about here on Reddit to solve this:

* I’ve taken ZMA and magnesium. They made me feel more rested in the morning, but I still wasn’t sleeping well. Also, they gave me headaches and eventually triggered stomach acidity.
* I stopped drinking tea and coffee, even though I only had one cup a day, in the morning on an empty stomach, just in case it was overstimulating me.
* I tried the red glasses at night. They make me feel sleepier before bed, but I haven’t noticed a big difference in my sleep quality.
* I’ve gotten into the habit of writing down my thoughts at night because I’m a classic overthinker. I also started meditating for about 10 minutes before bed a few days ago.

Here are some random notes for context:

* I travel quite often and spend time in different countries and time zones. However, this doesn’t seem to impact my sleep. After a week of adapting to a new place, I can sleep just as well or just as poorly.
* I usually go to bed between 9:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. When I wake up in the middle of the night, it’s usually between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m.
* During these periods, my athletic performance drops significantly, though it doesn’t affect me mentally as much — unless the period is prolonged. For example, last year, between January and February, I had several months of poor sleep, and by then, I did feel some mental impact.
* On my mom’s side of the family, everyone has or has had sleep issues. Maybe the problem is genetic.

I think that’s everything. Sorry for the long message, but I wanted to give as much context as possible.

Today I ordered glycine to see if it helps me get better rest.

Thanks in advance, and best regards.",1,1736697815.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

Especially for being so patient about this thank you thread - after a whole bunch of issues with my cats, and for some reasons huge mental block about writing this post for no reason, I'm finally getting to it.

This was the first year I've done the secondhand exchange, and I adored it! My partner made it soooo special. Not only did they send me a whole bunch of perfumes and an adorable bag, they also sent some toys and silvervine for my cats (which they ADORE!), some really cute 3d printed charms and a bookmark, a few small skincare products, some really interesting candy (some of it is not pictured because I had already eaten it by the time I took these pictures - some phenomenal banana candies!), curry leaves and lime leaves (which I've already cooked and were DELICIOUS), as well as a book , some stickers, and a greeting card!! The book is next on my tbr and I can't wait to get into it.

My partner sent me a whole bunch of perfumes!! I really liked a lot of them. I won't list every single one, but I'll give my favorites I've tried so far and my thoughts on them!

1. Manor by Solstice Scents - so spicy, and rich, and deep. This one became an instant favorite. Seriously considering FSIng!!

2. BPAL: haunted - I adore a sweet lemon scent. One of my favorites!

3.Deconstructing Eden: Healing - I looove this one. It's a really clean, springy scent. I'm excited to wear it once it warms up outside!

4. Deep Midnight: Hazel the Relentless - coffee and cocoa!!! What more could a person need!!! 

5. Alkemia: Sadzi - I'm such a fan of a citrus, and the rosemary adds so much to it. I love the way the notes on this one blend together.

5. Possetts: Strigoi - I've yet to meet a Possetts scent I didn't like, and this is another example. Woody and earthy and rich, but with a nice lemon herbal note to balance it out. This one is really unique in my collection, I don't have anything like it, so it's nice to have!

This is just my top 6, there were so many more! I was so fortunate to have such a thoughtful exchange partner this year, who made the secondhand swap so enjoyable. Thank you sooooo much, and thank you for being patient for this post!!!",3,1736697543.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

Picture this: a crowded train carving its way through the city, every seat filled with quiet stories and unspoken thoughts. The hum of the wheels is steady, almost hypnotic, until our eyes meet across the aisle. It’s not just a glance—it’s a thread, delicate but unbreakable, weaving us into a moment neither of us expected. The conversation that follows feels easy, like stepping into the warmth of a familiar melody. By the time the train slows, it feels like the journey wasn’t about the destination but the person who made it unforgettable.



Perhaps it’s fate, or perhaps it’s just timing, but here I am now, extending this moment to you. If you’ve ever dreamed of a story that begins with serendipity and grows into something real, let’s start that conversation. Let’s create the kind of connection that turns ordinary days into extraordinary ones.



***About Me***



I’m a quiet soul with a curious heart—a writer who sees poetry in the mundane, a dreamer collecting moments like stars, and someone who treasures the small, fleeting joys of life. I find magic in golden-hour light, songs that speak to your soul, and words that linger long after they’re spoken.



I’m not someone who needs grand adventures every day, but I’ll never shy away from chasing them when they call. Whether it’s wandering an unfamiliar street, hiking to the kind of view that takes your breath away, or losing track of time over coffee and conversation, I seek the beauty in both the extraordinary and the quiet in-between.



I hope to start with friendship—authentic, natural, and full of possibility. Every great story begins with a single word, and I’d love for ours to start here.



***What I’m Looking For***



I’m searching for a kindred spirit—a woman who carries kindness like a quiet strength, whose curiosity is a window into a world I can’t wait to discover. Someone who finds beauty in life’s smallest details and isn’t afraid to dream big, to laugh loud, or to sit quietly and just be.



I want to build something together—a shared world where we celebrate life’s quirks, explore its mysteries, and craft dreams into reality. Whether it’s the simplicity of a shared playlist, spontaneous road trips, or building a project we’re both passionate about, I’m looking for a partner to grow with, someone ready to co-author a life full of meaning.



***What Sets Me Apart***



I notice the little things—the way the sky blushes pink just before the sun dips below the horizon, the way your voice changes when you talk about something you love. I’ll remember your favorite coffee, the song that makes you cry, or the story you can’t stop telling. These details are the threads I weave into the fabric of connection, creating something strong and lasting.



Loyalty is my cornerstone. I’m the one who shows up—not just for the big moments but for the everyday ones too. I’ll send a text to make you smile on a hard day or plan an impromptu evening under the stars when the world feels too heavy.



I’m a romantic at heart, but not in clichés. I believe in the kind of gestures that make you feel truly seen—a handwritten note tucked into your bag, a playlist that feels like it was made just for you, or a Sunday turned magical because we chose to make it so.





*If you feel that spark, let’s talk. Let’s trade stories and dreams, uncover what makes each other’s worlds shine, and see where this journey might lead. Because sometimes, all it takes is one message to start a chapter that feels like it was always meant to be.*

It’s not just a bakery, though—it’s a highly successful restaurant that runs from early morning into the evening, and this morning, it was bustling with activity.

A man, let’s call him Jim, was sitting a couple of seats down from me at the bar, enjoying his coffee and some toast. He looked to be in his forties, had his laptop with him, and was quietly minding his own business—at first.

Enter the baker. He appeared behind the bar to have a quick word with one of the baristas. Jim must have caught wind of the conversation and realized that this was the baker. As the baker turned to head back to the kitchen, Jim seized the moment and struck up a conversation.

At first, it was innocent enough: Jim mentioned that he’d started baking sourdough bread three months ago. The baker, being a good sport, seemed genuinely happy to chat. But as the minutes ticked by—15 of them—it became painfully clear that Jim didn’t know when to stop.

Every time the baker tried to wrap things up and excuse himself, Jim would lob another question about hydration ratios or scoring techniques. At one point, the baker and I made eye contact, and the look on his face was unmistakable: pure, trapped despair. The poor guy was swamped with the breakfast rush, and here he was, stuck in a one-sided baking seminar.

Finally, someone from the kitchen called for the baker, giving him the perfect escape. He politely wished Jim luck with his sourdough journey and hurried off. My wife and I couldn’t help but laugh about it on the drive home, comparing Jim to a fan sitting courtside at an NBA game, pestering a pro with questions about his jump shot mid-game.

1hzpk42,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1hzpk42/can_i_be_better_at_managing_my_barretts_esophagus/,Can I be better at managing my Barrett's Esophagus?,"Apologies for the long post but really looking to improve my life and gain some pointers. I (36F) was diagnosed with Barrett's Esophagus in early 2020, inherited from my father. Have had the symptoms for as long as I can remember (around age 10 is when I remember it starting). Had two endoscopies in 2020 and 2023 and next one will be 2026. My GI reassured me that I didn't have to give my life a complete overhaul and basically recommended that, in addition to my meds, I simply avoid the foods that definitely trigger me* and sleep upright. (*Main foods that trigger me, as do most here I'm sure: tomato sauce, CHOCOLATE, peanut butter, raw or cooked onion, garlic, any type of peppers, certain white wines, and Brussels or cabbage or anything cruciferous.)

I'm managing it the best I can and took steps immediately after the diagnosis to try and nip it in the bud, but after lurking on this sub for a bit and continuing to experience some symptoms I'm curious if there's anything I'm doing that's just abjectly wrong or ways I can improve. Call it a 2025 resolution if you will, but I really am starting to wonder if my lifestyle is actually not nearly as good as I think it is, and I want to be here for a long time.

Here's a quick breakdown of my daily life:

1. Every morning when I wake at 6am I take one 20mg delayed release Omeprazole tablet (Kirkland brand, shout out).

2. Drink one 22 oz. travel mug of black coffee with 1.5-2 tsp. of sugar from around 7:15 to 8. (I know this is bad for me but I can't give it up just yet 😫)

3. Eat the same breakfast of Greek yogurt, honey, banana, and granola around 9:30-10. 

4. Late afternoon/dinner time, if I know I'm dining out where the menu is chancy or will be drinking wine or eating pasta with red sauce or something greasy, or even just eating large amounts, I have 1GM Sucralfate on deck which I'll take approx. 1 hour before I know I'm eating said meal. I maybe take this once or twice a week depending on my plans.

5. Take one 10mg chewable Pepcid (famotidine) nightly before bed.

6. Sleep upright every night on adjustable mattress. Not 45 degree angle but somewhere between that and flat, probably like 20-30 degree angle or something like that. 

7. Drink plain water all day (though sometimes if I'm in the throes of a heartburn flare-up, even plain water will make it worse.) I also drink a TON of Polar seltzer waters at home. Like, my BF and I run through cases of these like crazy. The bubbles help me burp and relieve heartburn, gas, and indigestion and are better than sugary soda but lately I've been reading these are actually horrible for your esophagus and teeth so eff me, right? 

8. I drink a glass of two of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe 3-4 times a week. Don't drink beer or liquor unless I'm out at a bar, which is rare. I avoid iced tea and juice at all costs. Haven't had cow's milk in ages.

9. Lunch varies but dinner rotation is typically: salmon & asparagus, chicken & rice, steak/pork & potato, salad with any of the aforementioned proteins, pasta with meat sauce or meatballs (I cut it with a ton of carrot for alkalinity to counteract the tomato, but garlic & onion are likely not helping me). No fast food or frozen/processed/premade anything, but we do order 1-2 times a week for delivery either pizza, cheesesteaks, burgers, or sushi. Pizza surprisingly never aggravates me though, maybe it's the dough to sauce ratio?   

10. Lastly, I have a sweet tooth BAD. I've conditioned myself to crave a little treat after any savory meal and it's a problem. Chocolate wreaks havoc on me so I've been trying to cut it out more and more, but I can and WILL go in on sugar cookies or cakes or pastries or donuts if they're presented to me. I'm also a home baker and love eating what I make.

11. I'm relatively active/fit and not overweight, although I could probably stand to lose 10-15 pounds. I do at-home yoga and strengthening exercises daily/every other day, and when the weather is nice I do 45 minutes of walking daily. Unfortunately if I wake up with heartburn I have to forego yoga - can't even fathom being upside down.

12. I do not eat past 8-9 pm and don't eat breakfast until 9:30-10, so it's sort of like intermittent fasting. I also never lie down immediately after eating. If I do crash/nap flat midday, I'm basically done for.

As for symptoms, I could go weeks with no problems and then BOOM suddenly I'm hit with a flare-up of heartburn, nausea, gas, and indigestion that can last up to 3 or more days, even with managing it and taking my meds. When it's really bad, I can feel my diaphragm area pulsating in pain or my whole body is so filled with gas I feel like a balloon that needs to pop. A few things that trigger my flare-ups: if I don't eat for a while after drinking coffee and have a bunch of acid just sloshing around in my empty stomach, on the weekends if I wake later or stay up later or forget to drink water or eat at normal consistent times, if I OVER-eat which I've been known to do, or if I'm PMSing and have bloating and cramping which pushes up on my esophagus. Also, weather changes between summer/Fall and Winter/Spring affect my GI issues, I just know it. Something about the barometric pressure, don't quote me on that.

Mainly, is all of this a decent start, or could it be better? Is any of it really ill-advised, like my precious seltzers? Is the first step cutting out coffee and wine? Do I need to incline my head more at night? Should I try to keep the weight off and exercise more? Is sugar really the worst offender?

1hzpjlv,https://i.redd.it/oxesdr7y3lce1.jpeg,The One Lesson That Could Transform the World: A Journey into Shared Understanding • [Click to Expand],"## Teaching the World One Concept: The Power of Compassionate Connection
  

If I could teach the entire world just one concept, it would be the art of empathetic understanding. Not just surface-level empathy—the polite nods or generic statements like ""I understand what you're going through""—but the deep, soul-stirring kind that requires us to pause, step outside ourselves, and genuinely try to grasp another person's perspective. Let me tell you why I believe this single idea has the power to change the world.  

I’ll start with a story, something that happened a few years ago. I was sitting in a bustling coffee shop, armed with a laptop and a head full of deadlines. Across the room, a young woman was on the phone, tears streaming down her face. I remember feeling a mix of irritation and guilt. I had work to do, and her raw emotion felt like an intrusion. But then I stopped myself. Why was I so quick to judge her pain as an inconvenience to my productivity? I let go of my own agenda for a moment and watched. Her anguish wasn’t a performance; it was her reality, right there, spilling out for everyone to see. I didn’t know her story, but I knew enough to empathize with her pain.  

This small, unspoken shift in perspective made me think: What if we all took a moment to try to truly see and understand the people around us? What if we stopped assuming, judging, or rushing past each other? What kind of world could we create if understanding became second nature?  

### Why Empathy Matters  

Empathy is more than just ""being nice."" It’s about creating bridges between our differences, acknowledging that while our experiences may vary, our feelings—love, fear, anger, hope—are universal. Imagine what could happen if we collectively embraced this idea. In politics, leaders might prioritize dialogue over division. In workplaces, collaboration could replace competition. In schools, students would learn to value their peers for who they are, not what they achieve.  

Take conflict, for example. Most arguments, whether they’re between two people or two nations, stem from an inability to see the other side. I once had a disagreement with a close friend about a deeply personal issue. We both dug our heels in, convinced the other was being unreasonable. It wasn’t until we sat down and listened—really listened—that we realized we weren’t as far apart as we thought. Our differences weren’t about right or wrong but about fear and misunderstanding. Empathy didn’t just solve the problem; it strengthened our relationship.  

### The Ripple Effect of Understanding  

Teaching empathy doesn’t require grand gestures or expensive programs. It starts small—listening without interrupting, asking questions instead of assuming, pausing to consider another person’s feelings. These small acts create ripples. A parent who practices empathy with their child raises someone who is more likely to practice empathy with their friends, coworkers, and eventually their own children. A single moment of understanding can inspire countless others, spreading like wildfire in the best way possible.  

Consider historical figures like Mahatma Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr. Their movements weren’t driven by brute force but by a deep understanding of the human spirit. They didn’t just fight for justice; they sought to understand the fears and motivations of their oppressors, appealing to their humanity rather than their hostility.  

### Why Don’t We Do This Naturally?  

If empathy is so powerful, why isn’t it more prevalent? One reason is that it requires effort, and let’s face it, effort isn’t always appealing. It’s easier to label someone as ""wrong"" than to dive into the messy, complex reasons behind their actions. It’s simpler to surround ourselves with like-minded people than to engage with those who challenge our views.  

Modern life doesn’t help. The constant barrage of information and distractions makes it hard to slow down and connect. Social media, while offering opportunities for interaction, often reduces complex human experiences to soundbites and snapshots, making it harder to see the full picture.  

But here’s the thing: the difficulty of empathy is exactly what makes it so valuable. It requires us to stretch beyond our comfort zones, to face the uncomfortable truth that we’re not always the heroes of our own stories.  

### Practical Ways to Foster Empathy  

So how do we teach the world this concept? It starts with education—not the textbook kind, but the experiential kind. Schools could implement programs where students role-play different perspectives, fostering understanding from a young age. Workplaces could encourage team-building exercises that prioritize emotional intelligence over output. Communities could host forums where people from diverse backgrounds share their stories.  

On an individual level, we can all do more to practice empathy in our daily lives. Next time you’re stuck in traffic, instead of fuming at the car that cuts you off, consider the possibility that the driver is rushing to something urgent. When someone’s words sting, pause to think about what might be fueling their behavior. And when faced with opinions that challenge your own, resist the urge to argue and instead ask, “Why do you feel that way?”  

### Empathy as a Foundation for Change  

Imagine a world where understanding wasn’t the exception but the norm. A world where disagreements didn’t escalate into violence, where loneliness was met with compassion, where barriers of race, religion, and ideology dissolved in the face of shared humanity.  

This isn’t a utopian fantasy; it’s a possibility rooted in something as simple—and as profound—as empathy. It doesn’t require everyone to agree or get along all the time. It just requires a willingness to see each other, to listen, and to care.  

So, if I had the chance to teach the world one concept, I wouldn’t hesitate. I’d teach the art of empathetic understanding. Not because it’s easy, but because it’s necessary. Because in a world so often divided, it might just be the one thing that brings us together. And who knows? Maybe the next time someone sees a stranger crying in a coffee shop, they won’t just look away. They’ll understand.

One of my lifestyle changes is to stop intermittent fasting and start a regular weekly dry-fasting. Yesterday, I finished my 3rd 2-day dry fast. Specifically, it's a 44-hour dry fast (and at the same time a 47-hour water fast). For the first 2 weeks, I was doing OMAD with an 18-hour dry fast and 22-hour water fast daily. I did it because I like to be adapted to fasting as much as possible before trying a 2-day dry fast. It worked!

Since the 3rd week, I stopped the daily fasting. One advantage to this is I can enjoy coffee on non-fasting days more safely. The next advantage is I can go longer fasts regularly without being too skinny. I just weighed myself this morning, too, and found out I actually gained 3-4 kg. :) I don't know if I gained because 1.) I stopped coffee for a while or 2.) I also went back to working out daily or 3.) I just reset my gut microbiome to improve nutrient absorption. Maybe a combination of at least 2 of these.

Anyway, I could have gone longer than 2 days yesterday so I think I really adapated to it perfectly. Still, I won't do a 3-day dry fast until next month. Hopefully, I can fully adapt my new fasting routine:

Now that I'm ready to dive deeper into the coffee rabbit hole, I'm trying to decide on my upgrade path. I'm torn between two options:

1. Getting a DF64V (64mm DLC Flat Burr) grinder first, which would give me control over grind size and let me grind fresh for each shot while still using the AGARO
2. Upgrading to a proper espresso machine with a 58mm portafilter and better steam power (considering Gaggia Classic Pro Evo or Lelit) while keeping pre-ground coffee temporarily

My long-term plan is to eventually have both, but what would you recommend getting first? Would love to hear from those who've been through this upgrade journey.

[Breville Bambino Plus]","Hi all, getting back into the game after being away for a while from a failed first start. I recently bought a Bambino Plus, and I have a Mignon grinder from the prior attempt that I had given up on so that's a huge plus. This time around I'm getting the hang of it a lot more, and also just the other day learned how to better dial in the grind on the Mignon. All of this is still _generally_ new to me so it's a learning curve but so far it's working out a lot better than the prior attempt. Back then I was also changing a lot of variables.

Currently trying to dial in a shot and want to make sure I have the fundamentals down. My understanding is if its too sour / acidic / bright then I need to reduce the flow so it takes a bit longer to pull the shot, which for basic adjustment usually means either increase the dose or use a finer grind, and if its too bitter speed it up by backing off on the dose or use a coarser grind. Correct? 

Yesterday had one that was too sour but had a strong citrusy taste which is one of the notes in the bean, but still too acidy and strong. So figured the best course of action is to up the dose and see how it goes. This morning I took the dose from the about 15.8 yesterday up to 20 which I knew was too big a jump and sure enough it came out strongly bitter, so threw it out. Dialed the dose back to 17.5 and it's much more drinkable but still seems a bit sour. At 15.8 the liquid came out pretty steady on both holes of the portafilter, but at 17.5 and of course at 20 it was at least partly dripping out of one side, though at 17.5 a minor bump of the pf did cause it to flow a bit better. Also I am using WDT which has been remarkable to see the difference in WDT vs non-WDT, _WOW_.

Basically want to make sure I'm on the right track here with adjusting the dose being my primary variable to focus on right now, with grind being a secondary variable. With this my next step would presumably be to up the dose to maybe 18 or 18.5.

**Q: How will I know if/when it's time to stop at the current dose and switch to adjusting the grind?**

Variables from the FAQ:

- Roast: medium to medium-dark (I guess?) roasted within last couple weeks, sourced & roasted by a local coffee shop. Didn't realize they weren't fully ""dark"" when buying, and have learned dark is easier to adjust so will go more for that while learning.
- Bean: From Guatemala, bag states ""Variety: Caturra""
- Dose: Adjusting as above
- Yield: As above
- Time: Each shot initiates in about the 10-12 second time and the pull is complete in about 30-35 seconds. **I am using a digital scale with integrated timer for measuring both dose going in and yield during pull.**
- Workflow: Grind from Mignon (after previously dialing in the grind following a video on how to detect burr sound and set on espresso grind). Grind into pf + dosing ring. Weigh dose on scale after taring it out before grind. Load pf into machine. Place scale + cup under pf. Press double shot button and use default preset values. On 3rd flash of double shot button (about when hear the pump engage) start the timer on the scale, saw some others say this was when to start on this machine. Temp is on highest setting.

Notes: 

- 54mm stock Breville pf, non-pressurized basket, double shot. I have a bottomless pf from earlier try but want to ""graduate"" to it once I learn how to pull consistently first.
- I'm using Hoffman's descriptions of sour as sensing acid along the sides of the tongue and bitter as ""attacking the whole mouth."" Hopefully I have sour/bitter correct. 
- Should I pull a ""salami shot"" to make sure I learn the difference? Just learned about that last night.",1,1736696436.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

i had the app set to go so I got orders, and in between kids carpools as I walked into safeway with the tween, I accidentally hit accept for a fire wings food delivery... and I had never done one before but needed   I didn't want to cancel on my first trip .... I didn't know to check the total miles... and had NO IDEA I had signed up to drive 25 m away to a busy area in commute time!!! took over an hour total.... got a $2 tip. sucked

  
2nd time was a grocery store order on xmas eve or night before that so store was out of sooo much. anyway:

# things I learned the hard way.

# + Things I wish I had known a couple of things beforehand.  

  
1 - you need to be near the restaurant or grocery store to get orders... if you live in the suburbs pretty far out you won't get many order offers... you may need to drive to the hot area and work from a laptop at a coffee shop for your main job or other side hustles... 

2 - making decent money comes with doing multiple order deliveries on a trip...  the times I've done it it wasn't like REALLY worth it BUT I was a noob and there's always a learning curve with stuff.

3 - most importantly.... it will tell you the restaurant you're picking up at, it will NOT tell you where the delivery is being dropped off until after you go pick it up physically, have it in your hand and mark it picked up on the app....

4 - even more important --- before you accept an order, LOOK at the TOTAL MILES for the trip, it is the only clue you can get as to how far you'll have to go.  the app does not let you select an area or range on a map that you can deliver to....  this was hard for me because I had kids carpool to do, and commute is so bad after 3pm in a couple of local areas bc its the bay. 

5 - if the grocery store order has an item that has a refund if not found selected, no matter what you do, you can't choose a replacement item for them, even if they ok it on the messengers/app.   going shopping later at night or around a holiday sucks because a lot of things are out.

6 - if you take grocery store orders, pls only go to the stores you know the layout of, bc MAN I would get so mad back when I was the one ordering delivery and the delivery person/shopper just marked they were out of stock bc they didn't know where in the store it is, or they're too lazy to figure it out, or its like a single dude that doesn't shop for a family like us moms do. I know where stuff is... anyway

7 - if there is a toll bridge that toll is included in your pay quote at the beginning but your toll isn't reimbursed separately. you have to pay with your Fastrak and then your Uber Eats delivery pay includes the cost of the toll... so mentally do the math of subtracting that 7 or 8 dollar toll from the total estimated earnings to see if the trip is worth your time.

  
8 - the beeping when there is a delivery offer is sooooo loud and I don't think you can turn it down.

  
9 - I only got a 2 dollar tip for a long 25 mile each way total 50 miles/over an hour drive on my first delivery because I didn't know how things worked and I accidentally accepted the delivery offer.... they track how many times you cancel after accepting and the % matters....

  
10 - you have to do like 100 deliveries to get to gold status...

  
11 - download a mileage tracking app to track your driving trips alongside your Uber delivery app.... i recommend the one that does it automatically which is Driversnote.  One of the other apps I looked at required you to manually enter in trips and it's too easy to forget (not ADD friendly as I call it)

  
12 - consider your MPG/gas mileage for the car you drive and if it's worth it, maybe calc the gas it cost you using the app mentioned above. My old #$% cars both get like 18mpg average which is BAD ...

  
13 - note that a lot of people who order deliveries apparently like to require this code, a PIN number they have to tell you when you hand it to them. you need to enter it in before you can claim its done and get paid for the trip!! if you forget they can message it to you. 

I personally would select for them to leave it at my door with no PIN bc my hood doesn't have theft and there's always someone home... but you gotta watch the app / notifications otherwise if you forget it may get cold being out there too long.

  
14 - make sure and don't forget any drinks they order bc a lot of the time YOU have to go fill the drink and put lid on etc.  

  
15 - I tried to sign up for instacart which I hear is a little better or door dash but both those had a wait list and were full 

16 - it took a bit to sign up bc you have to submit ID and car insurance information and watch training videos about safety driving that r stating the obvious, and wait on a background check I think? you can have multiple cars and toggle which one you're using.  the training videos talked mostly about driving safety and did NOT walk you through the full accepting an order process. maybe i was too busy to find whatever training section they offer online... but it was like diving in deep end on first swim.

17 - you want to have a phone charge cord and keep it charged bc you get lots of warnings once your battery is below 15% or so :/  the app is absolutely mandatory.  if youre not gr8 with tech/apps, def not the job for you. it isn't super hard, but I'm married to a tech challenged guy my age and he def would have trouble figuring it all out.

1hzp3fk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1hzp3fk/a_newer_sweet_brew_profile_version_11/,A newer Sweet Brew Profile (version 1.1),"Glad everyone has been enjoying the Sweet Brew Profile I shared last week.

For those that missed it, here is the original version 1.0 of the Sweet brew: [https://brew.link/p/z25y](https://brew.link/p/z25y) . It leverages a much cooler bloom cycle before ramping up to 94C and then tapering down in temperatures (80C bloom, followed by 94C / 93C / 92C / 91C).

I've been experimenting with lower temperatures a lot more since discovering how much a cooler bloom changes the overall brew. I made a newer Sweet profile that maintains a lot of the sweet brew characteristics but also seems to bring forward some of the juicier notes in the coffee.

**Here's a new experimental version 1.1 of the Sweet brew:** [**https://brew.link/p/yO3e**](https://brew.link/p/yO3e)

This starts with the same 80C bloom, but then ramps up slower to the target brew temp of 94C before dropping down (91C / 92C / 94C / 92C).

I'm currently brewing a Honduras fully washed, light roast from Kurasu in Kyoto. The tasting notes are ""Floral aroma, taste of red apple, pear and green tea, ripe apricot-like sweetness and accompanying aftertaste."" and they all seem to be intact with this new profile.

No question in my mind the Aiden is so thermally stable that more delicate coffees seem to get cooked if you try and just replicate what you do with a manual pour over. I have also upped my grind size on the ZP6 to between 6.0 and 7.0 to allow the basket to drain faster.

Enjoy! They're not necessarily better than each other, so would love to hear your experiences with both profiles!

(USA here).","Honestly, as long as the raw fish is salmon, people like to pretend it’s a more unusual (USA) sushi option here. I didn’t eat fish, for the record.

The miso soup was so good, and not an unusual part if you like it, as I have for years. I ordered a seaweed salad, instead of a salad with only lettuce and dressing that only tides you over. It took some getting used to, but I’ve had seaweed salad a couple times, so it wasn’t too hard. I had to have a few small pieces of a vegetable tempura appetizer, to make all that plus a sweet potato/cucumber/avocado vegetarian roll, seem more appealing. Ok, the tempura and miso soup were standard USA sushi restaurant options.

I felt like it was my birthday. The only special occasion was a warm enough day, in winter, that you even want to leave the house, still cold to do anything outside! I feel motivated from just the enjoyment being there the next morning, from the day before, even more than I would from drinking more or stronger coffee than usual!

I said yes to the invite absolutely last minute. It was also not easy to choose almost-healthy options, other than the sweet potato part of the veggie roll and the tempura being fried. Ok, it was easy. I lied. 

I would choose those if things that were that delicious were normal for me, so I may learn to cook things several times every week that are not always the same style, but are awesome other than the cooking part, delicious, and healthy. Who doesn’t like healthy foods that take work? The issue is when you are assembling cold ingredients, and there’s only so many salads you want as a meal instead of a side with a sandwich or something plus snack food at home.

The first character you meet has the trauma of being forced from his home and he chose to rebuild his life.

Then we have the dlc characters who so many of them are motivated by their pain from the past. Jousha time in the legion and the pain he felt from becoming the burned man. Then he loses his home that accepts him. So many of the dlc characters lose their home one way or another.

Ulysses is in my belief motivated by his trauma and the want to find a safe place to call home. The bull and bear bs is in my belief is hiding he needs a place that feels like home. Thats why seeing the white legs use the braided hair hurts him is because thats the first place he had the was his home.

I dunno. I'm not even sexually attracted to her. She's just... pleasing, you know? Brightens up my day.

Oh and I painted her once and uploaded it on Instagram, tagged her. She saw it, thanked me, even uploaded it as her story with a source to me. Tons of other people reacted to. Some complimented my art. One said it looked like a ghost but it was nice. I don't want to pursue any further connection. I'm not into romance anyway. I'm 19 and had one ex. I'm done with young love for now, but I'll take the little joys that come my way.

Also, thanks to her, I expanded my music taste into Indonesian stuff. It sounds just like Filipino stuff, whether it be today or decades ago. Chrisye sounds like VST and the Boyfriends. Daun Jatuh sounds like, I dunno Cup of Joe, maybe or some other hush voice like Munimuni.

It seems really hard to actually plunge the dang thing and I'm worried I'll be another post with a picture of water and grounds everywhere at best, and gnarly burns at worst.


Generally speaking, 35g of beans ground at a 14 (Baratza Encore) with 500ml of water (at 180-185). Pour, rest for 90sec and swirl gently then rest for 30, then plunge. Regular paper filter that shipped with the XL.

Based on what I've read and videos I've watched it seems like it's much harder to plunge than it should be. I feel a lot of resistance from inside. The finished cup is good and generally doesn't have a lot of fines/silt (there's a little, I'm assuming it's normal)...but it just seems really hard to plunge.

First, so grateful for this community - I've read through the posts here and have been able to learn so much from all of you here! ☕️  
  
Long time barista here, going back to the early 2000's when managing a small coffee shop in Illinois, where we actually cared about crafting the perfect espresso shots every time. Back before the internet had a lot of information on how to do it, we relied on our Italian customers whose families had been preparing proper espresso for decades to teach us how it should taste. Peppering in some old school individuals from Colombia and other countries who knew how coffee should taste, we had a veritable school right there, with our customers, that taught us how to do it right. And was it ever fun.  
  
Fast forward to today, where, as we all know, the art of espresso is hit or miss. I live in a town where it's impossible to find a place that makes it right. And I've been searching for a way to recreate the proper shot in my home for over a decade. Enter the Robot. 

After a few misses, I've been able to get *extremely close* within the first 10 attempts which is fantastic. I'm currently awaiting the arrival of the Baratza ESP, along with the shipment of the same beans I used at the original coffee ship in Illinois, to fully dial in the glorious espresso that I've long since been waiting to experience again.

Luno has started an awful habit of scratching the carpet at the door frame in the middle of the night. He’s ripping up the carpet, rattling the door, and waking us up. I don’t know what to do to get him to stop. Tarte only tries to stick her paw and arm under the door to reach in and get our attention. 
I swear we’ve tried everything and can’t get Luno to stop the scratching.

1) scratching post with different angles by the door. 
2) using scratch deterrent scents like citrus, coffee, lavender, scratch deterrent sprays from Walmart. 
3) putting something like a blanket they can lay on and to scratch instead putting it in the way covering the carpet, and against the door to stop the rattling. 
 4) clipping nails, changing litter box more frequent, feeding as close to bed time as we can, setting up toys for them to play with in the middle of the night.

Picture this, an attractive girl being accompanied by a guy to a movie who has a crush on her but she just sees him as a nice guy friend. 

He has spent months showering her with attention & she’s in her grey zone about her feelings.

Upon exiting the theater, she dropped her purse and the man of her fantasies tapped her on the shoulder to return the purse. She was mesmerized & thanked him profusely.

 She asked him how she could repay him & the man suggested they grab coffee someday. With a blushing grin, she gave him her phone number. All of these took place while the friend was in the washroom. Thoughts raced through her mind, distracting her from the reality that is the present moment. Some of the fantasies that she imagined were sexual, hoping that it will turn to a reality.

Days later, she texted the man of her dreams. She was willing to spend the night with him, even if she could never see him again afterwards. 

Texts turn to dates, & eventually they spent a night together. 
Her friend was “invisible” during that period, & he struggled to recollect the incident that led to the disappearance of the crush. 

Weeks passed by, and the future seem bleak for the friend. One evening, he received a text from his crush. She was remorseful & was eager to meet him to pour out the sorrow that shook her. 

The man of her dreams “ghosted” her after finding out the outcome of her pregnancy test. The friend felt disappointed, but nevertheless gave his undivided attention to console her because the fact that she came looking for him was the “hope” that made him believe that he was still visible to her. 

He felt the warmth of her tears on his shoulders as they came into a tight embrace. It was a deja vu moment for the both of them, but it was only felt by the friend, as he recalls the incident that happened a few months ago. They were back in the same position but it was due to a different reason this time round, he thought. 

As he stared at the back of her neck, a rush of emotions hit him like a bullet train whizzing past an abandoned station. The bruise on her neck was still visible, although slightly faded from the previous time he saw it. It was caused by the fury of another ex-boyfriend whose sole purpose was to teach her a lesson for hurting his already fragile heart. 

Was she an unfortunate victim, or was it her foolish actions that caused the misery to repeat itself. ",1,1736694310.0,shortstory,0,1.0,False

1hzofxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/modeltrains/comments/1hzofxe/a_newbies_foray_into_model_railways_with_009_scale/,A newbie's foray into model railways with 00-9 Scale,"Hello all. This year, I've decided to finally make a model railway layout for myself after years of feeling like I couldn't have one due to a lack of space. What changed was being inspired by all the small, compact layouts that have been appearing online, as well as discovering 00-9 scale.

Initially, I was looking at doing a layout at N scale but found that trying to model my layout around what I wanted, which was Scotrail, proved to be difficult as there are fewer options in N scale than there are at OO scale. With many being out of stock and harder to find on the second-hand market than they are with their OO scale counterparts. I did have room for a small OO layout if it was a point-to-point or shunting one, but I wanted a continuous loop layout to just watch a train run around. It was during my research into N scale that I came across 00-9 scale, which is the same scale as OO scale at 1/76 scale but uses N gauge tracks to simulate narrow gauge railways.

What finally made me settle on this scale was the fact that my island nearly had a railway built on it in the late 19th century, a narrow-gauge one, to be exact. Four proposals were attempted; you can see them in the third image. Using 00-9 scale and the extensive range of 3D printed locos and carriages, as well the off the shelf ones, I could create a hypothetical version of what could have been on my island.

So, to begin with, I've ordered several help and guidebooks and a 00-9 layout book for inspiration. I also got lucky when browsing one of my local stores to find that they were selling a cheap coffee table (seen in the first and second images), which was short enough to fit under my hobby desk with plenty of room for a baseboard with scenery on it. Building the baseboard is the next step, but I've got to wait until the weather becomes less damp and snowy, which hopefully isn't long as the snow is already melting. For baseboard size, I'm looking at probably 2ft to 2'6"" in width and 4ft to 5ft in length. Once it's built, I will start looking at the layout in more detail. Hopefully, it won't be long before I'm posting progress pics.

1hzofe8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hzofe8/no_one_was_there_cleaning_pt2/,No One was There Cleaning Pt2,"   Welp, it's been a few days and a few people have asked about my work so I guess I'll tell you about my most mundane job just to let you see how the job usually is. I'll avoid the Kansas holocaust story until… forever. If I could go to therapy and knew I wouldn't get in trouble for this job, that scenario would definitely be the reason I'm in therapy and I don't want to put you all through that. Maybe I'll just tell you the one that sounds a bit like a conspiracy theory and considering the state of the world we're in right now I get the feeling we need a conspiracy. 

   I'll back up a bit. My job is to clean up crime scenes before they get called in or found out; drug deals gone wrong, a senator strangled an underage prostitute to death in a motel room, a cult accidentally summoned the wrong deity and now said deity is hunting for its mate in Wisconsin. (By the way, Dupe’s Bar has the best cocktails after a long day of cryptid chasing. Great staff, ten outta ten.) anyway, my job is to go in, clean everything up to the best of my ability to make it look like nothing happened at any point, and get out of there before anyone finds out. My company doesn't technically have a name but I just call it ""No One Was There Cleaning.” You’d think that with how long we've been around, we would have a name by now but names require trademarks and trademarks require paperwork and the last thing we need is paperwork that verifies that this thing exists. Anyway, on to the “conspiracy.”

   Our current president isn't actually the president, the president has been dead for 2 years and the person in the White House running the country is a clone. I know this because two years ago, I was called to an apartment building in New York and I was told to clean up this apartment and make it look like nothing ever happened, as I'm supposed to do, and then forget anything that I saw in there. And do you want to know what I saw there? I saw our dead president with a very large stiletto heel sticking out of his skull. And I don't just mean the heel on this thing was like 6 inches, no I mean this shoe was a size 14. 

   I'm in the breakroom one day, just drinking coffee, chatting with my co-worker, the auto guy, when all of a sudden, Bossman busts in through his door and almost completely shatters the hinges so the door falls off the frame. He mutters something about “getting that piece of shit fixed later,” grabbed by my shirt collar and pulls me to the garage without a single word to me. I wave goodbye to my co-worker, yelling out, “I bequeath all my earthly items to you” as a joke, and just wait for my early retirement to begin. 

   He dragged me into the garage, slammed me into the side of a van and glared at me. “Here's the deal,” he growled, jabbing a finger into my chest. “We have a very important, high class call that you need to go on. Here's what's going to happen; you're going to go in, you're going to clean, you are going to get out, you are not going to ask questions, you are not going to look around, you are not going to take pictures. If you see anything that looks like something, no you do not. You are not allowed to speak, you are not allowed to breathe, you are not allowed to think, if at any point I find out you did anything that can risk our company with this job, I will reign hell fire on your ass. Do you understand?”

   Obviously I was terrified, so I just nodded with my eyes as wide as they could get, biting my tongue so hard I'm pretty sure I could taste blood. He just grumbled again, grabbed my shirt, and pulled me out of the garage toward a waiting helicopter. I instantly recognized it as Air Force One but, again, I stayed as silent as I could. I know I wasn't allowed to speak, but all I could think was, The president has done something and he wants me to clean it up? What could the president have done that requires our company? Did something happen with Korea? Are we having a CEO situation? 

   The flight was pretty long, as to be expected, and extremely silent. The secret service guy sitting next to me wasn't much for conversation, although since I was told not to speak I didn't really try. I just watched as the dark flyover states just flew below us until we touched down at a helipad in New York. From there I was carted into an SUV with extremely tinted windows and driven a couple of miles until we ended up at this very swanky apartment complex. Like I'm pretty sure this job would pay for a month's worth of rent at this apartment. There was a doorman, an elevator, a front gate with a keypad code; I felt like I was walking into Caesars Palace from The Hangover.

   I dragged my gurney and caddy along with me as I was escorted to the elevator, and the five of us were hoisted up to the thirteenth floor. They strode down the hall in their black suits and ties, fancy shoes, dark sunglasses and earpieces, with me next to them in my white painter's suit and a red tool bag filled with hazardous chemicals meant to clean any stain you can think of, and quite a few you don't think of. We probably looked like quite a bunch. We stopped in front of apartment room 1313, with two more men standing in front of the door, as it stood slightly ajar. I heard what sounded like a man sniffling, regaling a traumatic story and, when they opened the door wilder to let me in, I saw a man in a short, red dress, his face smeared with makeup and tears rolling down his face.

   He looked good in the dress, don't get me wrong, and I'm sure before the smearing, his makeup looked nice. When he looked up at me, fear and confusion in his eyes, I just gestured to the dress and gave him a thumbs up. He smirked, muttered a quiet, “Thanks,” in a feminine voice, and looked back at the man in the suit he… she?.. they were talking to. 

   I was guided toward the deceased body of our current-of-two-years-later President and told, “Make it quick, we don't have a lot of time.”

   This guy's got all the time in the world, I thought. But I shrugged and pulled at the shoe. It was lodged deep into his parietal lobe and I'll bet it was piercing his limbic lobe too, the heel was that long. It slid out pretty smoothly but I could feel the grey matter sucking it back against me. It released with a squishy pop and I started cleaning off the blood, bone shards, and brain matter, fully planning on offering it back to the red dressed person with no evidence of any sins it has committed.
“Here,” their voice called and the other heel clattered next to me. “Get rid of them; I don't want to see them again.”

   I shrugged, shoved the clean shoe in a white trash bag, put the other in a freezer bag and dropped it in too. An enzyme bath and these shoes will be back to selling shape.

   The men in black took some gloves from my caddy, slipped them on and all worked together to lift the body onto their own waiting gurney.

   “I, uh,” I stammered, getting their attention, their eyebrows all raised behind their dark glasses. “I know I'm not supposed to say anything but my company does offer disposal if-”

   “We'll handle it,” one interrupted. “You just clean up.” They escorted the body away from the bloody scene, dressing up the wound like it was only an injury, and took it out the door. One stopped at the messed up red dress, nodded toward the door, and escorted them out with no shoes or words. I was left with one black suit, this one a blonde woman, stood by the front door and watched me work.

   I just shrugged, slipped in one earbud and listened to a LITRPG audiobook while picking out pieces of brain and skull from the fibers of the carpet. Funny how a man with so much brain makes such poor decisions in life, I thought, saturating the carpet with a rather pungent mixture. I worked in the chemicals with a brush, watching the red liquid fade pink, dusted it with an unlabeled powder, and started working the powder in, the pink fading to white again. It was an enormous stain, like a serving platter, so that method worked on like a three inch circle at a time until the whole stain was finally lifted and the carpet was white again.

   “I could use a bit of that,” the woman in the suit finally spoke while I blotted the wet carpet with a towel. I looked up to see her facing forward, but her eyes were looking in my direction. “Ya know, lady things.”

   I chuckled, roughing the fibers. “You can probably just make it at home,” I offered and started spraying an enzyme eater on the whole carpet to seep down, removing any evidence that blood was ever there. “It's just peroxide and vinegar.”

   “And that works?” she asked, keeping her voice low.
“You just saw it,” I chuckled. I grabbed a spray bottle of the mixture and a washcloth and started on the splatter on the wall. The walls were about eight feet but somehow the blood splatter was only six feet up. Our conversation ended as soon as it started and I continued cleaning up. 

   After a few hours, I turned back to the woman to see a man standing next to her, another suit with dark glasses. “All done,” I announced and gathered my supplies back into my caddy. I was brought back to the SUV, drove back to the helicopter, and flown back to my worksite.

   I quickly forgot about that job until a few days ago when Bossman turned on the TV in the breakroom. The new kid, auto guy, Bossman and I were all sitting around having a coffee when I looked up and screamed, “Who the hell is that!?”

   Bossman looked at me funny and answered, “That's the president, Soft-Man.”

   I grumped at the play on my surname and responded, “No, it's not cause I cleaned up that guy's DEAD BODY two years ago.”

   “Impossible,” Auto Guy snickered. “That would mean the last two years, the country's been run by a dead guy.”

   “We've had worse presidents,” Bossman laughed. 

Thanks to everyone who commented interest in my work and stories. Also thanks to the people who messaged offering work. Unfortunately I can't just stop by and clean, Bossman checks my mileage on the work trucks so I can't sneak any extra jobs. I'll see if anything interesting comes up in the next week and maybe make a post on it. We haven't found a new guy to replace the last one yet so I'm kinda on my own right now. I'm used to it but jobs go by faster when someone else is there. I don't know, Bossman says he has a few interviews lined up but I don't think those'll go anywhere; he's kinda particular about employees.",1,1736693902.0,nosleep,1,0.66,False

1hzob9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iteration110Cradle/comments/1hzob9j/threshold_my_respectful_opinion_on_mercy_x_ziel/,[Threshold] My Respectful Opinion on Mercy x Ziel... and why I personally prefer Shira,"I get that Ziel's physical body didn't technically age, but people seem to forget that Mercy was twenty in the UKT and Ziel was thirty-five. 

We know that Lindon is around 26-28 by the time of the Lirin scene (sixteen at the start of the series, took seven years to ascend = twenty-three, plus Lirin's growth adds about three/five years). Assuming that Mercy is the same age, that means she would be around twenty-six/twenty-eight and Ziel would be forty-one at the least.

And we can't forget that Ziel mentally feels a lot older than his real age because of the trauma he has.

It's not that I have a problem with the age gap - it's that I find it really hard to imagine them cultivating a dedicated romantic relationship when they have fewer points of empathy to relate over. It's partly why we see her getting along so well with Lindon and Yerin, because all three are the same age and have the same goal - to advance. 

Those two points of empathy give them *chemistry* and *something to work together towards*.

Meanwhile, Ziel only advances at the end of the series. He's there to provide support, protect, and move past his trauma. And while Mercy also needs to overcome her mommy issues, she juggles it with the other duties the books require her to be - advancing and uplifting the rest of her team with her.

Ziel's character and character growth is *much* more independent of the gang for this reason. While he's shown time and time again that he loves and appreciates them deep down, he's not the sort to enjoy sitting at a coffee table and just... talking about stuff, which is what Lindon, Yerin, and Mercy like to do - partly because remember, they're all the same age.

Ziel is mentioned to enjoy fishing in Threshold (check the chapter where Fury and Mercy fight). That's a sport that implies his character really well, needs a *looooot* of waiting around for something interesting to happen. I can easily see him just relaxing, enjoying the peace and quiet in a serene pond as he waits for his hook to catch.

All of this is why the scene with Akura Shira exists in Bloodline. She's middle-aged and in her thirties, and she's playful - but only to those she gets to know. That's two points of empathy for her and Ziel, because not only are they the same age, but Shira would likely have a good understanding on when and when not to make fun of/have fun with Ziel - he appreciates her humor, but he also needs a lot of alone time and distance, which Shira would be able to provide because she can be warm and funny while giving that distance. 

And that's because we know from her previous treatment of Ziel (all formal and proper) to her light teasing that she knows how to push a little, then pull back. She's a commanding figure among the Akura Golds, which means she's also very independent.

>[So that's the level of thought I put into Akura Shira because she exists basically just to be a foil for Ziel in the story but she does learn to see him as more human over the course of the story. So that definitely happens, she does have a little bit of an emotional arc there where initially she's seeing him for his rank and then, of course, he doesn't act like he's high ranked at all. And so she kind of gets a little softer on him and inspires him to do better. So they have a very healthy mutual respect and relationship and they've agreed to go on a couple of dates but other than that I didn't think a lot about their relationship.](https://abidanarchive.com/events/25/#e1856)

Shira is also shown to have great chemistry with Ziel, whereas he and Mercy don't really interact much that we can see. And I think it's because Mercy wasn't designed to be a foil for Ziel, she was designed to be a foil for Lindon and Yerin; while Mercy *can be* and *is* a foil for Ziel (because every character in the gang is a foil of one another to an extent, which is why their chemistry is so great), Shira was specifically designed to be, which is why she and Ziel immediately click from the moment they have a conversation.

We also know that at least most of the Akura family decided to leave for the heavens, so there's a good chance Shira is still around.

All that being said, it would also be more interesting and funny (in my opinion) to see Ziel try his best to work through the weird stuff Shira likes to do for dates. Mercy is very traditionally feminine and romantic, so it probably isn't wrong for me to assume that she likes the more traditional, lovey-dovey stuff, like going out to eat or watch a movie (remember when she took Lindon out to that theater?). While Ziel wouldn't strictly *enjoy* either of those things, he would probably be more interested in what Shira has to offer, because while he's not an ice-cream-and-movies sort of guy, I could TOTALLY see he and Shira going out to a *museum*, because Ziel likes to see how things work (remember that he's into scripts and workings of madra), while Shira appreciates the weird and unusual. So while I can easily imagine Shira and Ziel poring over a dinosaur bone or otherworldly and/or archaic technology, I think Ziel would probably fall asleep halfway through the first act of a play (though I can see him trying to force himself awake for Mercy's sake, since he's also very caring).

>Ok, she seems like the kind of person who would appreciate something unusual.  Some sort of, something where the other person put in some to think of something you wouldn't normally do on a first date.  So probably not ice-cream, probably not movies.  Something like, I don't know, a Cradle thing, I was going to say something like skydiving from a giant mountain or something, or a flying creature, but that's a lot more usual on Cradle.  That probably wouldn't be too thrilling to her.  Something else.  And Ziel is the kind of guy who would not put any effort into that. [So there's a lot of issues there already that they are going to have to work though before their inevitable romantic development.  This is making me want to put a scene like this into book 11 though.  Just for the meme value.  Not for the romance storyline, because as we all know, I am allergic to those.](https://abidanarchive.com/events/26/#e1803)

Knowing that makes me interested in seeing Shira and Ziel work through their hypothetical relationship issues together, because a good author wouldn't promise all of these points of empathy and compatibility if these two characters wouldn't work out (unless the relationship falling apart adds to the value of the story, which it does not in this case). Basically, Will is showing us that these two are compatible so we know that despite their issues, the relationship can *work really well*.

All of this plus the fact that Mercy and Ziel don't have many interactions (as far as I remember) throughout the series, I just feel like it would feel... awkward and forced. I don't think Ziel would like cafes and movies, and I don't think I'm remiss in assuming Mercy's character is the sort to want a romance with more passion on both sides, which Ziel wouldn't be able to provide. 

Ziel is the sort of person who needs a lot of time for his feelings toward someone to grow. Shira can more easily give him the distance he needs initially - think of all those days spent quietly fishing - and when Ziel wants to go spend time with her, great, but she's not pushing him into anything because she doesn't have to - she understands that Ziel needs that time and Shira is able to be alone. In a scenario like that, I can easily see him over time spending more time with Shira as he finds her presence more and more enjoyable.

TL;DR Shira is able to relate more with Ziel, but it's also easier for her to give Ziel space and enjoy time by herself. She and Ziel would also find it easier for them to find things they both like doing. Mercy would probably find it hard to relate to Ziel, and Ziel wouldn't enjoy the more communal and preppy things Mercy likes to do.",7,1736693571.0,Iteration110Cradle,14,0.71,False

I've always had trouble with brownies.  It's been a long time since I tried them.  The Stella Parks  recipe seems to get a lot of attention.

I have regular cocoa powder and the recipe calls for Dutch (as do all the KA ones).  

There is no baking soda or baking powder in the Stella recipe.  

one website says if neither bs or bp just make the substitution (but never the other way dutch in place of natural).  
Other websites are way more confusing recommending a variety of changes to the bp and bs amounts ....except this doesnt have any.  

  Long explanations on how made and differences and bs and bp but not specific substitutions.  From the whole descriptions of differences on acidity etc. it seems like I should add....bs as a neutralizer?  Idk.

I made some friends at university who are very experienced in dating, and they push me to put myself out there. I recently reconnected with an old colleague from high school through instagram. She posted her university graduation on History and I congratulated her. Then I said something like “hey, since we haven’t talked since high school (5 years ago), what do you say we grab a coffee some day?…”. 

She said yes, and we agreed on having breakfast next Tuesday, I said I’ll pick her up at her home. Now I’m scared I’m gonna mess things up, and she’ll feel uncomfortable around me/dislike me.

I just feel like I’m naturally awkward, I have a natural serious face that can make people think I’m angry when I’m not… I tend to act kindly around people and not flirty, but that’s just how I grew up. Anyway, I’d just like to put it out and seek some advice from you.

I'm looking to meet and chat with new people about whatever we want, slowly getting to know the other better. I'm hoping for those chat to develop into a long term friendship where we can support each other and lend a hear to the other during difficult times. If we're attracted to each other it could lead to something more as I think the best relationship start with friendship rather than appearing spontaneously but I'm fine if we just stays as friend. It would be best if you live in Europe in order to avoid struggling with time zones. I'm open to meet and have a drink/meal together if we live close to each other. I'm also looking to travel to another country sometimes next year so if you live in an interesting place to visit that might be a good occasion to meet in the future.

  
Here's some info about me :

I'm 29, I live in France near Paris. I work as a software developer. Appearance side, I have brown eyes and hair.

I like videos games, mostly RPG and indie games but also  some coop games. I like playing board games with my friends and reading (recently started the Terry Pratchet books). Being lazy in my couch watching youtube videos about creepy internet mysteries is my guilty pleasure. 

I'm practicing martial arts, running (I'm participating to some running events throughout the year to prepare for a marathon next year) and a bit of bouldering.

I tend to be more of a homebody as I like to stay at home chilling especially during winter where I can be comfy watching TV with a plaid and some coffee. But I also like from time to time to move outside to see a friend or all other kind of occasion.

I really like animals, even though I don't have any at the moment so feel free to send me a pic of your pet if you have any.

1hzo4qu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hzo4qu/aita_for_cutting_off_my_sister_financially/,AITA for cutting off my sister financially? ,"My fiancé was hurt several years ago and nearly died. We had been dating for 6 months and we were happily discussing a future together when he was hit by a commercial semi truck. Several years of pain and recovery went by with no ability for him to work and me spending all my time caring for him. He has injuries to his abdomen and one entire side of his hardly functions from his ribs to his toes. 
The only income we had was disability for the covid years and a bit beyond that. Then he won a settlement. He got a significant windfall  but not what we were told we could get. That was fine with us after all we had been through as we could finally get things he really needed to have a better quality of life like mobility equipment and a new truck that would be dependable. 
We immediately invested more than half his settlement in ways that made it almost impossible to get to so we would have it later. We took all the best advice from people along the way and it panned out nicely. We are set up for years to come because we did this immediately.
We also bought 2 acres. We could have gotten a big house. We could have had one built to suit his needs but we were conservative about it and found a beautiful spot in a secluded area with lots of.peace and quiet. We spent a small amount on it initially and then did some work on the property via a family friend who's a retired contractor. It's exactly what we needed, nothing more, nothing less.
Now about the family. He has a son and ex-step children all grown. I have 3 children 2 of which are grown and one was 8 when we met. He lives with us and his father has passed away years ago when he was a baby. My children and mother as well as my biological family know me too well. They know I am logical and reasonable but that I will quickly call out bad behavior.  I won't tolerate people begging for the money destined for him. I don't spend money on myself for frivolous crap. It's just not me. He insists but I prefer to buy him stuff he needs and good quality food that we could not afford to help heal him. My entire life's goal is to help him recover mentally, physically and spiritually. 
I helped my mom out for a while but when she moved in a mooch that began bringing drugs home to her I had to cut her off financially. I will only gelt her food now if she's in dire straights. Her boyfriend is younger than her by 18 years and isn't disabled.  Just lazy. My biological sister is in another state and has no drug or alcohol addictions but has zero ability to adult and has been unstable in any sense of the word her whole life. My parents entitled her and now with my dad dead she has no one to bail her out of her poor decisions.  
My other step sister is more like a best friend for me. We were always close when we were poor. I started having doubts when he got hurt and all she could talk about was the money he would get. She and her youngest son have disability and it's not much to try to live on. The problem with her is she chooses random, bad men who hurt her and use her all up then she comes complaining to us about everything we warned her about. I have accurately  predicted every single wall she would hit since we met. She always says I'm right or she understands but does 100 percent the opposite of what I suggest and gets exactly what I tell her she will get. It's been frustrating.  
Now, she has been asking for help ever since we got this money. We had a jeep and when we bought our truck we took it to a mechanic and spent a couple thousand on getting it all fixed up. We gave it to her and she took it back to her home state where she lives now. We have recently looked at my husband's cash app and we have sent her over 6k in (emergency) help in 2 years. My own biological family haven't even gotten as much financial help as her. 
I have tried getting through to her many times. She has made every single decision, against my advice, which has resulted in terrible hardships for her and her autistic son. I have told her I'm done continuing to bail her out of this stuff and if she wants me to continue to help her she will move back to my area and her and her son can earn money by doing some simple jobs for me. That way they are not trying to use a man, or do something immoral, or degrading to get the extra funds needed. Plus she would help their self esteem by earning it somehow, me taking into consideration their disabilities. I also told her I would set up a case plan to help her see a way through to getting a house for her family so she can afford to live. She says it's a good idea but then her son says he doesn't want to move and doesn't want us telling them how to live. 
Last month I had enough of all this and finally messaged her back after another request for money right after we gave them several hundred dollars for Christmas.  She immediately asked for cigarette money days later. The messages were to the point and I bluntly said that we were done being an ATM for her bad decisions.  If she wants any further help she'll come down here and accept help on OUR terms for once. If not she is free to continue to live where she's at but without our help. I would talk to her but not help out financially. She's staying where she is. And less than a month later has just asked for more help as her last man took all her stuff like her bed, tvs, coffee pot, and many other items. Because she let him ""replace"" these items, the police let him take it all. It's exactly what I predicted months ago when he threw away her stuff to buy new. 
Not my problem. She can still come here. I have an apartment big enough for her and her son. She's welcome to a free 6 month stay with boundaries and a set plan to save and buy a small home for them. But I told her NO to getting her anything else. I am tired of her making us feel like we're the only way she can do better.

I’ve been drinking filter coffee my entire life, but I’m now looking to transition into the espresso lifestyle. Therefore, I’m in the market for an espresso machine and an espresso grinder.

After lurking on this subreddit for a while, I’ve noticed that the GCP E24 is often recommended for newcomers. However, after some further research, I discovered that the Rancilio Silvia is also an excellent choice. That said, I’ve read that both the Rancilio Silvia and the GCP E24 might struggle when it comes to making 2-3 milk-based drinks on the ""same"" time. This led me further down the rabbit hole, and I’m now considering the Rancilio Silvia Pro X.

While I do have the budget for it, I wonder if the Pro X might be overkill as a first machine. To make a final decision, I’m asking for your recommendations.

Here’s a bit of context:

* I expect to make 6–10 coffees per day, depending on whether I’m working from home. For this, I believe the GCP E24 or Rancilio Silvia would suffice.
* However, I often have family over (4–6 people), so I want to be able to make 6 drinks within a reasonable timeframe. This is where I think the Rancilio Silvia Pro X might be a better option.

That said, I’m completely new to espresso machines and have no idea what these machines are truly capable of.

My budget is around €2,000 for the entire setup (espresso machine and grinder). I’m not locked into any specific machine, so I’m open to other recommendations as well.

This is a reiki transmissions guide for Peter (Usui Reiki Master Level Practicioner). 🤲✨️

Before the session:
1. I recommend you DO NOT eat at least 1 hour before. You can drink water and have fruits. I also recommend avoiding caffeine (coffee, green tea), all alcohol and all meat products. 
2. During the live energy transmission (or universal reiki energy acceptance period at your own time) stay in a relaxed position sitting or laying down).
3. Make sure you're not interrupted and DO NOT have any important tasks or obligations immediately after the session. Give yourself time.
4. Nature sounds or 432hz music may support you well during the session so feel free to put it on as it'll help you relax.


Peter always takes his time with the sessions. Usually does prep work 15-20mins before the session begins to work on his own vibe and mental preparedness. Then starts the transmission without a predefined time. It may take him 30-60 minutes for one session. He intuitively knows how much time is enough for the person or the group.

I am looking at the 7.2 kWh Power Station, Delta Pro with Extra Battery on Amazon for  $3,700.

Anyone have this unit? How would it hold up for say if I needed to power things for up to 36-48 hours? Mainly want to be able to run a portable heater in the winter, power the fridge, be able to make food (Microwave, Coffee, etc), maybe run a TV and turn on the internet, and so on.

I've been on my handbag obsession lately and saw that The Horse also made backpacks. I am considering on getting one but not sure what size. 

My main criteria would be:

* Carrying my 12.9 inch iPad Pro to coffee shops, libraries and occasionally work (I work on a desktop so the iPad would be for meetings).
   *  While I love the look of work totes, I'm sadly not a work tote girl
* More of the sleek, slim design
* Versatility, I like how you can carry the backpack also as a crossbody and top handle

I would consider getting the regular sized backpack (I know it would fit my iPad) but wanted to know if the mini could also fit an iPad because I prefer the design and look of the mini more.

For those that have a backpack or mini from  The Horse, how much can you fit inside it? And if you have suggestions for alternative brands, let me know! ",0,1736692615.0,handbags,1,0.5,False

Watched Blue Velvet, Eraserhead, didn’t like either, watched Mulholland Drive in December 2023, one of the best and most haunting movie experiences of my life. I can go way deeper into that but that’s for another day 

I got into Twin Peaks and the rest of Lynch’s filmography after that but mainly Twin Peaks. Seasons 1 and 2 I was obsessed with, I loved them so much. Fire Walk With Me was brutal but incredible as well. Boom, season 3. The first 7 episodes to me was some of the best and most innovative shit I’ve ever seen in my life. I got to episode 8, I lost it. Wasn’t vibing with it at all, and everything that happened after that as well, just seemed too dark and nihilistic for me so I stopped after episode 14 in March 2024. 

1 year later as when I first started the original Twin Peaks (Jan to Jan) I just randomly decided to resume Twin Peaks. A lot has happened in my life since last year, a little too much, but these past few months been some of the darkest times ever for me. Feeling hopeless depressed etc it’s a lot of painful feelings involved, so I wasn’t sure if I wanted to watch Twin Peaks knowing how nihilistic the ending is (I got a slight spoiler). 

But, I just decided to watch it today. I wanted to wait until the end of the show to really show my thoughts but this feeling is only present so I’ll just explain how I felt about episode 15 and 16- absolutely amazing. Probably because there was a lot of throwbacks involved I loved it even more, but just the darkness of The Return itself the atmosphere and how weird it is (specifically the scene where Mr C met Philip Jones was INSANE to me) I love all of it. 

I don’t know if this also has to do with the massive amount of coffee I drank (my heartbeat racing fast lol) but I just wanted to say I feel this certain way after watching those episodes, and I’ve felt this way before with Lynch’s work too that only he provides, as if my world gets shaken up after consuming some of his work. My heartbeat has to do with how eerie and creepy these last few episodes have been, and I feel like along with that Lynch puts in so much care and sensitivity into every single scene he just does it unlike anything else, and he will forever be an inspiration for me at that. It’s like even though it’s so dark and damn near hopeless at times, his work is healing, and it changes the way you view life beautifully. I don’t know how. That’s mainly what I wanted to say. I hope I like the next two episodes as well, but I honestly think after a year now in my new headspace I could just rewatch all of it and I’ll appreciate The Return even more for some strange reason.

1.  They need a descale button that just continues pushing water through until the tank is empty.  It’s just a pain in the butt to keep raising and lowering the pod cover and pressing a button to cycle through the descaling solution and the water afterwards.  MAKE that easier so I can hit one button, and walk away.  Come back and it’s descaled.

2. Design internal tubing that’s more scale resistant.  Maybe there is tiny vibration after each use like your cell phone to break up deposits.  Maybe use stainless steel.  I don’t know but solve the problem.

It’s truly painful.  And I’m seriously moving back to the tried and true.  ",3,1736692316.0,keurig,9,0.71,False

She recently got put on Keppra and things have got very very bad ,"First and foremost I love my mother but she was recently switched over to Keppra from her original medicine she took for as long as I can remember I'm 33 my mother is 66. I'll start listing the side effects and very strange behaviour my husband and I are noticing and going through with her right now.

#1. My mother and father have been married almost 40 years mostly happily. One day I took her computer and noticed a weird man's name popping up talking to her and realised she's in a love scam and has sent this human all kinds of money and is not deleting him my brother and husband and I have not told my father yet cause it will crush him if he hears that but maybe he needs to?

#2 She can't stop talking and repeating herself you can't count 10 seconds of silence she'll just start rambling on about absolutely nothing.

#3 When you are engaged into a conversation with her for example I'm going to use my cat but she does this for every engaged conversation she's in doesn't matter who it is could be the guy in the convience store.  I'll say something simple like ""isn't Wallace cute right now"" and immediately she'll not acknowledge what I've spoken about no matter the importance of what I've just said and immediately try and relate it to something in her life in this case immediately talking about her cats. Every. Single. Time.

#4 She does not sleep she goes to bed 10 pm saying she's so tired and my dog woke me up last night at 2 am cause he had to pee and I find my mother in the kitchen making coffee at 2 am saying she's up now.. I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks and guess what I had one for 2 hours straight because i feel like my mother is absolutely going insane and it's killing me.

#4 when we'll be watching a tv show and she'll dose off she talks to herself in her sleep and will even grab her hair a pull it while sleeping. Is she having hallucinations?

#5 she cries for EVERYTHING 

#6 she doesn't eat she's literally exactly 5 foot tiny fragile skinny woman she says she's never hungry.

#7 she smokes cigarettes and drinks coffee all day long. She obsessed with her cigarettes and will not accept any other cigarette but her brand.

She is also in denial, she's a patient with chronic pain due to scoliosis and she blames the waking up and insomnia on her pain. 

Please any advice of anyone who's been through something similar you know Or if you personally have been through anything like this while using or observing someone on keppra any advice would be nice to read we are making her see her doctor but she is so stubborn it's absolutely killing us and making us feel helpless

(Finally managed to put out something readable after working on this all day.)

October 26th, 1993

The hum of the Rust Bucket's engine is a constant, grating buzz against the drumming in my ears. This isn't the usual low thrum of road trip anticipation; it's the high-pitched whine of anxiety, a sound that's become far too familiar these past few days. The meds help, or are supposed to, but lately it's like trying to quell a forest fire with a garden hose.

I initiated the ruse this morning. The Bulletin Board System, bless its digital heart, allowed me to reach Soror XI with some carefully crafted prose. I framed my message as a desperate plea, a confession of impending mental collapse. \[Three-week sabbatical,\] I typed, my fingers clicking against the keyboard in a nervous rhythm. \[Need to…regroup. Reassess. My mind… it feels like a broken radio, tuning into too many frequencies at once.\] I threw in a few dramatic ellipses for good measure.

The truth, of course, is only partially there. Yes, I feel it, the familiar clawing at the edges of my sanity. But it's not the breakdown she imagines, at least not yet. It's the sheer weight of what I've been uncovering, the unnerving puzzle pieces that have been falling into place – or not falling into place – these past weeks. What I'm feeling is a pressing need to address the situation at hand.

Soror XI, bless her rigid, bureaucratic soul, bought it hook, line, and sinker. She responded immediately, her message a flurry of concern wrapped in her typical clipped tone. \[Jim,\] she wrote. \[Your request is approved. We will air re-runs of your broadcast to maintain the schedule. Focus on your well-being. Really. This time off will do you a world of good.\] That last part was almost gentle, which, coming from her, is practically a hug. A hug that made me feel like a scoundrel for lying- for using my mental illness to manipulate. But I needed this, needed the freedom to move without scrutiny. She's probably relieved, I think, that I seem to have finally dropped the line of questioning pertaining to the previous Saturday's broadcast.

Leaving Scrimbus was like shedding a skin. I packed my faithful Datsun with the usual gear – camera, recording equipment, my expensive laptop with satellite link – and threw in a couple of weeks' worth of supplies. I drove east first, heading towards Anson. I needed to see Manny, needed to have a closer look at those photos that sparked the initial alarm when he called me at four in the damned morning.

The meeting with Manny at the gas station where we first met was brief and tense. He handed me the envelope containing the photos without a word, his eyes darting around like he expected someone to emerge from the shadows. The images were more disturbing up close, particularly the ones on I-35 right outside Waxahachie. The blurred, indistinct symbols, the unnatural distortion of light; all of it reinforced my belief that this was tied into the anomalies that wormed their way into my show. He also had another photo, one of the figure I had seen on my live broadcast, but this one was much clearer, with the distinctive red robes and pointy capriote as plain as could be.

The drive towards Waxahachie felt wrong somehow, a feeling that seemed to gather like static electricity around me. I kept glancing in the rearview mirror, the red-tinted lenses of my spectacles distorting the road and the sky into something vaguely sinister. I stopped at a truck stop in Thurber about halfway, the kind with greasy burgers and stale coffee. I needed a moment to clear my head. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, a discordant harmony to the anxiety gnawing at my insides. I was just digging into my meal, having applied a generous amount of A1 sauce to my burger when a payphone on the wall next to the john began to ring.

It's for me again. I know it. I hesitated, a strange sense of dread prickling my skin. But the ringing persisted, insistent, and I found myself reaching for the receiver.

""Hello?"" My voice sounded tight, even to my own ears.

A frantic voice crackled on the other end, a voice I recognized immediately. ""Jim, it's Suzie! They're everywhere! NAORC, they're all over Santa Fe! They're like... like cockroaches, crawling all over the place! And... and... "" Her voice broke, a choked sob cutting through the static. ""This has never happened previously; they're everywhere!"" And then the line went dead. Previously, she said... like the unfolding events were a movie she'd seen many times before. Was she watching the director's cut this time?

I stood there, the phone receiver still pressed to my ear, the grease in my fries instantly congealed. New Mexico. NAORC. This wasn't some isolated incident; this was a coordinated movement, a deliberate breach, and Suzie had just confirmed what I feared all along: that this wasn't just about the 'Other' presence. It was something far bigger, something far more insidious. The NAORC were never this bold in the past, usually sticking to their cloak-and-dagger routine. They are tenuous allies to the EOTO, but their goals are, to say the least, sinister.

My heart hammered against my ribs, each beat a frantic drum against the rising tide of panic. I couldn't go to Waxahachie. Not now. I needed to see what was happening in Santa Fe. I needed to meet this mysterious Suzie. I slammed the receiver back into its cradle, my mind racing, calculating. I grabbed my things, my appetite suddenly gone. The greasy burger remained half-eaten on the table, a monument to my abruptly derailed plans.

I was back in the Rust Bucket within minutes, the engine roaring as I tore out of the parking lot, heading west. The road was a blur, the landscape flashing by in a dizzying rush. The anxiety was still there, but it was now laced with a cold, focused rage. My hand tightened around the steering wheel, the ouroboros ring on my right hand feeling like a burning brand. The EOTO had taken me in, given me purpose, and I'll be damned if all they've done for me has gone to waste, even if they secretly knew something was going down.

It was well past sunset when I crossed the state line. The sign read: ""Welcome to New Mexico, Land of Enchantment."" But there was no enchantment here, only a chilling sense of foreboding. As I drove onwards into the vast expanse of the New Mexico dark, I glanced in the rearview mirror. There, for just a fleeting second, was a glimpse of something that made my blood run cold; a red figure, robed and indistinct, standing at the edge of the darkness behind me, its very presence an echo of the chilling image from my broadcast. I could feel its gaze on me, and it sent a shiver down my spine. It could just be a trick of the dim lighting, or the exhaustion of the long drive. But I knew one thing, without a shadow of a doubt; I wasn't alone.

And whatever this 'thing' was, whatever its purpose, had followed me to New Mexico.",1,1736691590.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Even now, in 2025, they're still seen as one of the best options in their class. But how do they compare to younger models? I've been using them for a while and would like to tell you what I think.

The first thing that stood out to me was how light and comfy they are, even for long listening sessions. These headphones are great for people who wear them for long periods of time because the headband doesn't put too much pressure on the head and the ear pillows are soft. Also, the noise reduction is great; it blocks out background noise well whether you're flying, sitting in a coffee shop, or just trying to concentrate at home. Over the years, Bose has made this function better, and it still feels great.

The sound quality of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra is clear and well-balanced, with deep bass and clear highs. If you like a more punchy sound, these might not be the best choice for you because they don't have a lot of bass. They're great for calls, podcasts, and all kinds of music, though, for people who like a more natural and balanced sound.

The battery life is good; a full charge lasts for about 24 hours. This will last for two days of normal use before it needs to be charged again. But some newer headphones from other brands have batteries that last even longer, so if you're always on the go, you might want to look into those. 

The price is one bad thing. Some people might not be able to afford the Bose QuietComfort Ultra because it is pretty pricey. Also, while they have a lot of great features, they don't have some of the newest tech that rivals do, like advanced touch controls or sound profiles that change based on the situation.

In 2025, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra is still one of the best headphones for comfort and blocking out noise. There may not be all the newest features on it, but it's still a reliable and pleasant way to listen.

The Bose QuietComfort Ultra might be good for you. Do you still like it the most, or do you like other headphones better? Share your thoughts below!",1,1736691476.0,TechFusion,0,1.0,False

They were all in/around a little sign that said ""jet"" on a shelf that had pet wood and friends on it (I forget the term for those kind of things; coffee is not brewed yet). The shopowner who had actual knowledge wasn't in, it was just someone quite literally ""running"" the shop. She was nice but couldn't tell me anything about anything. So, I just did the reasonable thing and decided to buy a smattering of everything.

1. The stick. This is the only one I think is actual jet, because it behaves like coal when exposed to flare (starts to burn, not melt, and glows orange like a piece of coal would). I also cut it and it tends to sheer off in flakes. Feels like it used to be *wood*. It is very lightweight and warm to the touch. This was the only one of its kind and was priced at $18. Do you think I am right?

2. These three shiny boys. These were actually *in* the basket labeled ""jet"" and I have seen these shiny tumbled stones for sale on the internet as ""jet"" and encountered them in person before. I bought three so I could smash one open. They are lightweight and warm but do not respond at all to flame except getting very hot. Inside they look to be some sort of glass, for sure. What do you think they are?

3. Heavy round boy. This guy is simply too dense to be jet, and it has little streaks of shiny gold that look like they are showing through the exterior. Have not busted him open because he is the only one of his kind. Isn't glass/obsidian (too dense and cold to the touch). Does not respond to flame.

4. Finally there is flat boy. I have not idea what flat boy is. I hope he isn't just a river stone that I paid $7 for. He is a little bit of a different color than Heavy Round Boy--more blue/purple? and a bit less dense, *maybe*. He's a lot less mass so it's hard to judge. Does not response to flame.

3. Heavy round boy. This guy is simply too dense to be jet, and it has little streaks of shiny gold that look like they are showing through the exterior. Have not busted him open because he is the only one of his kind. Isn't glass/obsidian (too dense and cold to the touch). Does not respond to flame.

4. Finally there is flat boy. I have not idea what flat boy is. I hope he isn't just a river stone that I paid $7 for. He is a little bit of a different color than Heavy Round Boy--more blue/purple? and a bit less dense, *maybe*. He's a lot less mass so it's hard to judge. Does not response to flame.

I know this is a tall order--there are lots of black rocks out there! But if anyone feels like they can shed some light on any of these 4 stones, I'd be grateful.

Edit: I should add that they all sink in water, but the only one that sinks at a noticeably slower rate is the stick. It also swirls with the water in the glass easily, like it's a bit denser than the water but not by a whole lot.",2,1736691142.0,Crystals,2,1.0,False
