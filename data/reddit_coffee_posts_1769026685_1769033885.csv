Ever looked at your bank account and thought, *""If I just had a little more, I’d finally feel secure""*? Here’s the truth: **Most people are sitting on way more financial power than they realize—they’re just not using it the right way.**

Think about it:
- That $500 in your savings account? It’s not just *$500*—it’s a **seed** that could grow into something way bigger.
- The spare change you ignore? It’s **lost opportunity** to let compound interest work its magic.
- The ""I’ll start investing later"" mindset? That’s **time you’ll never get back** (and time is the *real* currency of wealth).

### The Money Myths Holding You Back
1. **""I need a ton of cash to start.""**
   - False. Even $20 a week can turn into serious money over time. (Ever heard of the *latte factor*? Yeah, but we’re talking *espresso shots* of growth here.)
2. **""Investing is for Wall Street geniuses.""**
   - Nope. Apps and tools today make it **stupid simple**—like ordering pizza, but for your future.
3. **""I’ll figure it out when I’m older.""**
   - Spoiler: Your future self will *hate* you for this. Time is the **secret sauce**—the earlier you start, the less you need to put in.

### The One Move That Changes Everything
Here’s the kicker: **Most people overcomplicate this.** You don’t need a finance degree—just a *plan* and a *start*.

- **Automate it.** Set up a tiny auto-transfer to investments. Out of sight, out of mind (but *growing*).
- **Use tools that do the work.** Why guess when algorithms can optimize for you? (Yes, they’re that good now.)
- **Check in, but don’t obsess.** Like a plant, your money needs *some* attention—but not constant hovering.

**Pro tip:** You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement. [Check it out here](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb). *(FYI: That’s an affiliate link—if you sign up, I might earn a little coffee money. No pressure, just sharing the love!)*

### The Real Question
If you *knew* your money could work harder for you… what’s *actually* stopping you? Fear? Overwhelm? Or just not knowing where to start?

The good news? **The hardest part is deciding to begin.** After that, it’s just momentum.

So… what’s your first move? 🚀",1,1769033610.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

The idea is to design a pavilion made out of wood in an up and coming park. Me and my friend came up with this idea: since there is already existing, interrupted, circular path we thought about filling in that gap with our pavilion following the already existing shape. We have 3 different programs: a kiosk for coffee, a place to sit and a toilet all as different volumes connected by the texture of the new path and the porch (see the attached pics). Since the distance between the different programs is HUGE (15m and yes it has to be that big cuz otherwise it loses relation to the environment and the path i talked abt) so we filled it w various stuff: a tree, a sandbox, some stuff for the kids to do etc. We want the movement to be fluid from all sides of the park.

1qjbxq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qjbxq1/boyfriend_of_2_months_broke_up_out_of_nowhere/,Boyfriend of 2 months broke up out of nowhere,"Context:

bf and I met In the first week of university originally as friends. there was no attraction there originally and I actually liked another guy. however, I was really really drawn to him and found him very very funny but I did think he was gay for a while and wasn't conventionally my type. over time I spent a lot of time with him, after parties we would speak for 8 hours and I started realising I was drawn to him too much to just be friends with him. I loved him so so much as a friend and started developing a crush. for context this was both our first relationship. he eventually clocked I like him (not to focus on this as I dont care but I was also considered slightly out of his league as to why he never thought to pursue me) and he took me on a few dates. we ended up kissing and then started spending every night and day together and became incredibly close and fell in love within days as we really took it slowly and had a very close friendship foundation. I was so so happy, he told me he loved me the first night we spent together, we were tied at the hip, he told me he would die for me and that I meant the world to him, he would never hurt me. we were so close and I fell SO in love with him, I could stare at his face for days and spending every night with him got better every day. our relationship eventually became physical which brought us even close and he asked me to be his girlfriend and we were so happy. I did notice some issues with lack of effort though at times especially through texting, we had a bad fight and he immediately detached and didn't speak to me for a day and we did sort it out he apologised and took full ownership. then the holidays came and I left him at uni as I finished exams prior to him and everything was great (called twice a day, texted etc). the second he returned home to his parents, communication became awful. for context, his parents are quite controlling and he feels he owes his time to them. he went on holiday and I got really upset as he wouldn't respond to my messages for over 24hrs even thought I made it clear I really valued texting or speaking once a day. he came back and we spoke again and he seems very apologetic and the texting DID not get better and in fact worse. however, he still would be lovely when I would see him and he would tell me he loves me and bring up milestones and our future and how he is excited to be back at uni with me. I started resenting his lack of effort and we did have a rough patch as we entered a bit of awkwardness but I was willing to rough it out until we got back to uni and our normal state so we could calm down with each other where I would make my expectations very CLEARLY known so he wouldn't let me down again but I thought it was a small issue relative to our entire relationship and couldn't overshadow our great and young and fresh love. he tells me he needs me to go to coffee and brutally breaks up with me. he becomes cold and detached and robotic unlike his usual expressive self, telling me he only loves me platonically, he was unhappy for a long time, there were fundamental differences, the person I knew him to be was not the real him, he should have done this a long time ago and that he does NOT want a relationship. I am bereft, I dont know what to think and what to believe. the most hurtful thing hes done is actually give up on us this like, its so cowardly and selfish, taking all my autonomy and agency. we were not unhappy, he is avoidant and freaked out over some pressure on him and also in London became detached over parental pressure. how is he supposed to forget about his feelings for me like that? how can we go back to uni in a week and live alongside each other and he will never crave to spend the night with me or kiss me again? what do I do? why is he rewriting the narrative of our relationship to make himself think he was unhappy, there were two people in that relationship and he was far more enthusiastic and encouraging it to go faster than me, so why is he now pretending he doesn't want a girlfriend? the last thing he told me before I left is that he is so worried about us growing distant and him fucking up our relationship because he is. so bad at texting because his parents put pressure on him to preserve their family unit and aren't entirely supportive of him focusing on me rather than music and studies ",1,1769033291.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1qjbvyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qjbvyh/aitah_for_telling_my_roommate_off_for_bringing/,AITAH for telling my roommate off for bringing another dog into our house without asking?,"I am a 23-year-old female that lives with two other women. The problem comes with my roommate J(28). I have lived with them for almost two years now and it has been mostly fine up until this summer. J is just a messy and gross person when it comes to keeping the kitchen clean, dishes piling up, coffee grounds spilled on the floor all around the kitchen trash can (not sure how she always manages to miss the trash can), pieces of food and tons of seasoning left all over the counters. Although this is quite annoying, my other roommate(A) 27 and I ignore it to keep the peace until the three of us split ways this summer when we all move out.  

Now for the real issue. J has had a dog and I have had a dog since the three of us moved in together. This was fine and agreed to by all of us since we knew what to expect before the lease began. A little over a year after we had all moved in, J suddenly has this new dog at the house 24/7. I was confused as to where this dog had come from and why there was a third dog in our house(for context, we are in a small cookie cutter home and there are now two large dogs and my small dog in the house). After about a month of the dog living in our house full time, I asked A if she knew where this dog had come from. A told me the dog was J's boyfriends' dog and it will be living with us until the lease ends. I was a bit shocked as I then came to find out not only had J not asked me if it was ok if another large dog was added to our already small house, but she also hadn't asked A if it was ok either. This was a surprise to me as I know they are good friends. So fast forward from August to January, the dog is still living with us, and my roommate and I are both very irritated as she never asked us if it was ok, she just moved another dog in like she was the only person to consider in the house. In the year and a half that we have lived together I have never once witnessed J walk her dogs, and they regularly crap on the floors at night as she does not let them out. When they crap on the floors, she simply picks it up with a paper towel and does not even bother to sanitize or clean the area. I maybe see the dogs outside for 5 minutes... out of 24 hours a day. I don't understand why she took on a second dog when she barely takes care of the first one. 

She got mad at me the other day for putting the two dogs in her room so I could make my dinner without them under my feet and so I didn't feel as overwhelmed. I don't understand what else she wants me to do since the dogs aren't allowed outside by themselves since they will supposedly ""jump the fence"". This was my last straw. I came back at her saying well if I am not allowed to put them outside where animals belong, and considering you never asked if a third dog in the house was ok, which it is not to A or I, and your boyfriend won't take care of his own dog, then I will put the damn dogs in your room when I please. She has been ignoring me these last couple days, so I want to know AITAH for being pissed at her for bringing another dog into our house?

I honestly just miss not feeling stressed when I come home because I have two big dogs jumping on me and everything else we own, crapping on the floors, and shedding beyond belief all over the house, which she never helps to clean up. It feels like I have zero peace or personal space in my own home. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells 24/7 since she acts like we have to accommodate her and her unwanted extra dog in the house. It just seems very inconsiderate to not at the bare minimum ask A or I what we thought.",1,1769033182.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1qjbuxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1qjbuxw/tifu_by_sitting_in_the_middle_seat_between_a/,TIFU by sitting in the middle seat between a couple who was in an intense fight the whole duration of the flight,"This morning I was on a 5 hour nonstop flight to Denver for work and I couldn’t have chosen a worse a worse spot to sit.

So for reference, I was flying with Southwest and ended up boarding in a good enough spot where pretty much the whole back end of the plane was empty. I saw before boarding that the flight was 60% full and the gate agents kept saying to “spread out” and that it wouldn’t be a full flight.

Normally I absolutely WOULD NOT choose the middle seat on a plane but in this case and because of the announcement, I did because I wanted enough room to be comfortable and get some work done on my laptop again not expecting anyone to sit on either side of me.

So they are boarding the last group and the last round of 15 or so people are boarding. To give you an idea, at this point the plane is “full” but there are people scattered everywhere. But there were no full rows left just a bunch of single seats and a few seats that were side by side.

At this point, I have my laptop open, AirPods in and am hammering out some work when in the corner of my eye there is a woman who approaches the row I’m in and asked if she can sit at the window seat, I kindly say that’s fine and she scoots her way in.

A few people behind her keep walking back then a man stops at my row and doesn’t say anything, he just sits down in the aisle seat.

Both the man and woman looked like they had a serious RBF going on but I didn’t think anything of it since the woman was kind when first sitting down.

Anyway…about 10 minutes into the flight I hear the man look my way and say “so are you just going to ignore me the whole time or are you going to say something?” And it took me a minute cause I thought why is this guy talking to me? And then from my other side I hear “don’t f\*\*\*\* talk to me you bastard” then I look over, see they both have their wedding rings on and that’s when it clicks, these people are fighting and I’m in the middle of it.

From that point every few minutes, they’d go back and forth at each other’s throats and at one point it got so bad that people behind me clicked their flight attendant button to complain about the noise they were making.

It turns out that while they were waiting at the airport, the husband walked away to go grab a coffee while they waited and apparently he left his phone behind and the wife saw some spicy texts pop up from a coworker of his.

It was one of the nastiest fights I have ever literally been in the middle of.

Not sure exactly what was on those texts specifically but I think it’s fair to say they will have some things to work though 😂

TL;DR: Today I fucked up by sitting in the middle of a couple fighting because the husband was caught with sketchy texts on his phone.",11,1769033120.0,tifu,4,0.87,False

I could pay it off outright, but not really keen to lose a large amount of my savings as compared to the coffee a week it is to pay interest on the loan. I know this probably doesn't resonate with many here but it is what it is. With that said I'm still trying to be as wise as i can be otherwise

I'm looking at putting it on a Citibank balance transfer credit card for 21 months @ 0%. Now if I did say 600 to 700 buck repayments for 21 months it would be all principal (12-15k). After this, I'd either pay it off outright or I could (worst case) get another unsecured personal loan and sack off the credit card - paying off the personal loan quicker than minimum repayments would again minimise interest paid.

On the assumption I will not pay the loan off outright, is this logical/what are the flaws?

Prologue

The last thing that Selene saw was the sun, not her sun, but that persistent alien sun that she had come to hate. Her body by then was so far gone that a distant part of her mind wondered why there was a smell of roasted pork, without registering that it was indeed her body that had been turned to charcoal.

In the days that followed, paramedics only managed to recover some of her ashes and a deformed plastic mask stuck in the mold of an eternal scream. She was only 17, but she didn’t know that her death would change everything. That she would be the last straw that split humanity. The seed of rage.

She had gone out that morning with a sense of desperation, her city gone, her family probably turned to dust, herself trapped with a family of sheep that only saw her as a lion ready to pounce on their cubs. So, with many others, she had walked toward the governor's mansion shouting their outrage, their fear and their exasperation at the hatred of their supposed friends. Their grief too immense to be uttered in words.

We don’t know what was written on her placard, fire took that knowledge from us, but maybe it’s not important. Selene herself became the message: not one more. But in the dust of NY, ears were deaf to that feeling, fat cats had gone complacent believing that humanity’s back had been broken, that with a bunch of arrests they had extinguished the last embers of human pride. It proved a fatal mistake, the mask off movement might have been appeased at first. But what really outraged many was that the UN once again decided to stand with our gallant Venlil allies.

The first sparks were limited protests across Eurasia and the solar colonies, that popped like mushrooms here and there. In the EU, in China, in Russia. And then it spread everywhere like metastases. Those in the Americas were quickly suppressed as the UN power was far too great in the new world, but elsewhere it proved harder. Especially after police and military started slowly but surely siding with the crowd. There was another young girl who proved to be the key, her name unfortunately is lost. The only thing we know is that the photo of her being beaten by horse mounted police while holding a blank sheet of paper will be forever with us.

\*\*Date\[Standardised human time\] October 23rd 2136\*\*

‘Some probably would say I'm being too emotional about this, Kalsim and his fleet completely ignored us after all, \~\~Par for the course really given how the UN treats us\~\~. And that this isn't something that can't be forgiven ,the aliens don't know any better. Frankly, anyone who says that is part of the problem, the whole reason were in this clusterfuck even.’

‘This weird… Apathy towards our people? I can't think of what else to call it, has for some reason become popular.’

I idly tap on my desk, my frustration still simmering in the silence of my office as I try to focus on one thing. \~\~I need to calm down, think logically\~\~

‘The whole reason for the UN's existence was to stop us from starting another satellite war. Peacekeeping, actual peacekeeping, yes, this meant that some smaller nation's governments have lost some autonomy, Taiwan used to be it's own country instead of a province, for one. But, in general, people have had the best quality of life since the SW. With essentially two superpowers somewhat tolerating the other and being each other's watchdogs.’

‘Did I have my issues with them? Yes, but I suppose… I got comfortable with the UN, I could ignore the slow disaster response times, the lack of representation we and the other solar colonies have and how preachy they sometimes get.’

‘The first issue doesn't apply to us and despite our lack of a say we had the most autonomy by virtue of our isolation, so it didn't concern me. It should've, fucking a billion dead and they somehow think they can still convince the Federation to just abandon… God knows how much time they've had these backasswards ideas, in what? A few months?’

‘They think they can play peacekeeper for the whole galaxy? How the fuck do you even plan to watch over three hundred something species?’

My eyes fall on my laptop sitting on my desk

‘I know exactly how to get my view on this across to the UN.’

I see the faces of the other Lunar Governors all looking at me and each other with their own variation of a neutral expression in spite of our frustration of what is going on and everything that led up to it. ‘Clarke, Strugatsky, Cixin, Hayakawa… Alright.’

“So, we each have our gripes with the UN, none of us would be in this call otherwise-”

“I'm sorry to interrupt Simmons but I would prefer if you just get to your point, we all have a lot on our plate.” Crackles the voice of Hayakawa through the laptop.

‘I probably should get this over with, better to be blunt.’

“Right, I think we along with the rest of the solar colonies should cut ourselves off from the UN, refuse to provide them with any more ships.”

I pause, ‘Clarke is going to be the first to say something.’

“Simmons we can't-”

‘Knew it’

He sighs “We are too far in this to just pull out, yes we probably shouldn't have even pointed the Odyssey in the direction we did, but that's only obvious now because of hindsight. Even if everyone agrees with you and we try to tell the Feds and that we'll just do us, they'll do them, and it would be like we never made contact, you think they would let us? You don't think they won't send another fleet? Our best chances are to continue to gain favour with the Federation, relenting will just throw the relations with the allies we DO have in the Federation into the mud, and our work would've been for nothing, those deaths would be for nothing.”

Strugatsky lifts his shoulders in something that can be barely called a shrug “They did help us from getting wiped out…” ‘You can't be agreeing with this’

I rest my head in my hand, ‘This is probably going to take a while.’ “Those people who have died will have died for an earth with it's identity burned or it's people burned, if we continue to BEND ourselves for… What? Us agreeing to not interact with them would show we have and never had malintent. We would lose our olive branch with the Venlil, Zuruliens, and Mazic but we were doing well before them, we can do well without the aliens.”

“You're assuming that you're people are in support of your idea to not only separate yourselves from the Federation allies but also the UN.” Chimes in Strugatsky.

“No, I am not assuming, the shipyards on Endymion are on strike, I have protests outside my building wanting me to do this. I just plan on making it official.”

‘Cixin hasn't said anything, makes sense, China was hit badly and he's still to get past it, he's probably already with my idea. I think. Would help if they tried to back my point up if that's the case.’’

“Have the rest of you interested yourself in what your people want? How they're feeling?” My eyes scan their faces in their individual window.

“Shipyards in my colony are starting to strike aswell.” Hayakawa says, her voice less audible like they were saying it more to themselves. Or the call just had a moment of shit connection. 

‘Still undecided.’

“Some of my shipyards have have fallen victim to sabotaged and won't be able to continue production.” Strugatsky, voice not at all annoyed or bothered , atleast not outwardly.

‘I guess that's not the worst thing anger has made some people do. Atleast Stru's people have the spirit even if they are a little confused… Actually, he probably orchestrated it himself in all honesty, I swear I can see him trying not to smirk.’

“I'm with Simmons.” Is all Cixin says.

‘Atleast you were easy to convince.’

‘Now to try and make Clarke see sense.’

“Now, even if the public seems to be in favour of not continuing to participate in this war, we still need a poll. I think we all put a poll out, and no matter our view we will respect the public's decision. Afterall what is the point of us being a democracy.”

“Simmons, I remember you complaining about the publics decision to go to war with the Arxur.”

“They didn't have any information to go on other than what one of their ENEMIES told us, the UN should not have held that kind of vote on the words of two individuals and a video.”

“And what basis are we going to hold this poll on? Your theory that they will leave us alone when we back out? That the UN will just let us in the first place?”

‘Now he's just stalling.’

“So, we'll make the polls, and see what the public says. I'm sure they'll consider every option and can make their own decision. We'll see if this is something they really-”

“Don't ignore me Simmons.” His voice is noticeably harder, even over the quality of the audio. “You realise the shit this would start? Earth will be divided at a time when we need to be cooperating more than ever! We have a common enemy, pretty much at our doorstep, and y-you're here wanting to spark a fucking civil war!”

“If it comes to that Clarke then the solar colonies and any other nation who feels as we do need to be together. You're the only one who isn't in favour.”

Clarke pauses, looking away from his screen entirely. I can't quite tell through the tiny window showing his face, but I think I could see him physically trying to hold back a flood of… Words he'd like to call me.

‘I have never seen you so emotional.’

He looks back, not at the others or something else on his desk, his eyes are dead on me.

“If this turns out differently than how you imagined then you have only yourself to blame.” His voice low and tired, I think I even heard a crack.

‘... So is that an agreement?’ 

“I don't know why you're singling me out Clarke, I know I'm not alone in how I feel.” 

‘Mars, Titan, Calisto, they're probably having the same conversation as us.’

“If you can be more clear in your answer Clarke?”

He pauses, his eyes still in thought. 

‘Take your time Clarke, the fact you're taking so long to answer means I've already convinced you.’

“I hold a vote…”

‘... Thank you.’

“That settles it, we'll each release our polls as soon as each of us can, as much as I'd prefer to have us do it at the same day, I'd rather we get them out before the UN tries something to stop us. While I've been assured my laptop isn't bugged, I wouldn't be surprised if big sister was recording this, I'm betting eight euros our polls will ‘disappear’ anyone want to join in?”

I look at each of their boxes… None of them laugh, except Clarke with an involuntary snort I only noticed from his movement, the sound quality was too poor for me to hear.

After a few awkward seconds, I can see Strugatsky take in a breath, wanting to move on.

“If you could elaborate Simmons, about your comment about the other nations, have you stated your intentions to them? In which case-”

“No, No, don't worry.”

I knew where Strugatsky was going. ‘I'm not stupid, I wasn't going to flap my lips to someone who most likely had a James Bond wannabe working under them to tattle to Jones.’

“Any other nation that could be in favour, we'll know by how they respond to us putting our foot down.”

I wait, in case someone has anything they'd want to ask or add.

‘Doesn't seem like they do.’

“Well, thank you, honestly, this has really brought my hopes up despite recent times and… Things I've seen.”

\~\~I couldn't tell it was a girl at one point until I saw the headline, it just looked like… Something burnt.\~\~

“I wish you luck, all of us…”

I leave the call, leaning back in my chair and let out a tired breath.

‘Oh, I just remembered a quote that would've been perfect to end that call with… Oh well, maybe it would've seemed preten-”

The air isn't filled with much sound, other than the crowd murmuring to themselves and the people near, the tap of my footsteps as I watch the podium get closer. Surprisingly no clicking of photos.

At least basic human decency hasn't died yet.

I have done this bit so many times I could do it on autopilot, regardless of my emotional state or that of whatever the crowd's. As much as I didn't care for these, it was expected of me, and if I have no other option I am atleast going to do it well… As well as I could, I've been told I have the presence of an accountant whenever I'm out in these settings. people think twice about your judgement, you can't be completely callous either, that scares people and you alienate them.

Turning smoothly to look at the crowd, I can see every chair to my left, to my right, and in front of me, taken by people in the uniform of their nation and respective rank all looking back at me, the colours making a dull triad of black, green, and navy. Some faces I recognise, Lt Colonels that have served under me, most others I don't, but they seem to know me judging by their thinly veiled disdain. Whatever I had done to them, there isn't much they could do to give me any payback.

I adjust the sleeves of my service uniform, I didn't need to, but it helps me remember what I practiced. I know there is no shame in bringing notes… But you're definitely not going to impress anyone by bringing any.

I take a deep inhale

“We have all gathered here… Not.. to listen to me spout pageantry, ‘Oh all those brave men and women who died vali- no, and we are not here to mourn in silence either. What's been done to us, cannot be described as anything other than heart breaking, and nor can we wait for our grief to dissipate, that would take too long with how many of us have lost and how much we lost.”

I pause, taking another inhale.

“We're gathered here to look forward… To remind ourselves that this is far from over. I know that sounds heartless, ‘how could we just ignore what happened?’ well were not… The same way you see your friend, your battle buddy, or just anyone, who is alongside you disappear next to you in a spray of dirt after an artillery shell, the same way you see them peak over cover and be domed by the enemy…”

“You carry their body or what's left, and you continue… Not because you don't care but because you are still fighting, there is no time to waste, the enemy is still right across from you… And seeing someone you knew, you cared for, who isn't back home but was next to you, killed right next to you, doesn't do anything other t-”

I pause, out in the corner of my eye I notice… Someone walking to me, they look panicked, judging from their half-power walk and their eyebrows trying to meet despite the wrinkle in the way.

“Excuse me.” I turn away to face the man coming my way, leaning away from the mic. “What are you doing?” 

“The solar colonies have seceded.” He whispers to me, in any other time his coffee polluted breath would've made me pull away but…

‘I don't believe you.’

“I d-... Thank you,” I watch him quickly scurry away from the looks of the confused crowd, leaving me to continue with my newly redundant speech. I clear my throat, adjust my sleeves.

‘Where was… Where the fuck- Oh, right.’

“Doesn't do anything other than provide you with resolve… To quote General Patton, ‘When you stick your hand into a bunch of goo that used to be your friend's face… You know what to do…’

I pause, ‘I should cut my speech short… There is more important things I could be doing.’

“Thank you, for listening.” I turn away, trying to keep a steady pace while still getting away as fast as I can without causing a scene, hearing the crowd start to get more agitated, it clearly isn't working.

I get to the empty halls and abandon whatever proper way of walking I was taught to use in more official scenarios, taking my phone out of my uniform pocket, my thumb bouncing across the screen trying to call my driver as fast as it can, I'm not even paying attention to the screen as I put it up to my head. 

“Get me to the HQ, fastest route you know.” I say, my voice strained, still trying to hold onto that ‘polite’ tone you keep for special occasions, out of habit.

‘Why now? When were up a creek with no paddle, did they decide to wake up and jump the canoe!?’

‘Now is not the time to start having a rebellious phase, trying to get independence!’

Pulling the door open with how quickly I am going, it swings to the point of clattering against the wall, I don't stop to see if it dented, thin strands of my hair that aren't under my service cap blowing in the air.

‘Where is she where is- Oh!’

My eyes lock onto the car just across at the exit of the lot. I can see her waiting by the passenger seat door at the back, holding her hands obscured behind her, her blue eyes looking at me warmly if a little unsure of what the rush was. I dive in overzealously as she keeps the door open for me, my service cap getting crushed between my head and the ceiling before I sit down. 

Hearing the engine rumble to life I finally let myself slack, feeling the car pull out into the street.

‘Ok, who would follow the solars? Denmark, Russia, North Africa, possibly China, and Vietnam. They were hit by Kalsim badly and I could see them jumping in along with the dissident spacemen. There might be some rioting in South America but nothing that would lead to independence from the UN, Zhao I think could keep riots to a minimum on his end too… Nothing that directly threatens us. Still I preferred if we didn't have our shipyards taken, I'll have to see if the Zuruliens and Mazics will provide us with ships and places to construct new shipyards incase this takes longer than I'd prefer. That just leaves convincing the sec gen that I'll be more useful out focusing in tackling the bigger issue, the Federation.’

I feel the car slowing down, my body being forced to lean against the momentum wanting to throw me against the back of the seat infront. “45th street, General.” 

“Thank you.” Is all I can say before I shut the car's door, walking in my controlled but still inpatient way, struggling to hold myself from practically running, I remember to fix my service cap before entering. Looking at the skeleton of what used to be HQ of the UN here in Turtle bay, I can still notice some people trying to put flesh on the building's bones, reinstalling glass panes and supports, but I have more pressing things to occupy my mind.

Feeling the ceiling heaters assault me with hot air before I start to walk further into the hall, I look to make sure the security council hasn't been moved to a different part since Kalsim. From what I can see of the arrows denoting where every chamber is, it hasn't moved. Letting me walk on autopilot to think about what I will tell the secretary.

‘This isn't the setback it looks to be, this will be quickly solved, they just let their emotions get to them, they will calm themselves when they realise they have bigger issues. This will be a passing issue…’

So my recovery worker asked me to write this when I'd finished my time with them and thought I'd share in case it helped anybody else. I'm now 8 months into my journey, 3 stone lighter, the fittest I've ever been and finally enjoying life after 20 years of alcohol abuse!

On May the 5th 2025 I’d had enough. I was fed up, exhausted, pissed off and I knew I couldn't carry on like this anymore. I didn't care that I was slowly killing myself and life had no joy in it anymore.

The year leading up to this my drinking had got progressively worse, I was now going on full 3-4 day benders and the cocaine use was increasing. I was drinking up to 10 bottles of wine a week, sometimes 3 of those in a day often hiding my drinks by drinking it out of a water bottle. I started to get the shakes if I didn’t drink and felt horrific all the time. I was drink driving, leaving my daughter at home in bed unattended to go get drugs or more alcohol, taking her to school or picking her up drunk/drugged up. She'd often miss school with me lying in bed all day drinking or recovering from drinking/drugs, and I was hiding bottles all around the house. I was lying to family, my friends, missing appointments and letting people down constantly. My anxiety and depression were at an all time high/low and I’d had two serious suicide attempts in one year, both of which led to my being in hospital. I’d been involved with mental health services (who did nothing), social services (who did nothing) and begged my family for help (who did only as much as they could do). I was either going into a full mental breakdown with addiction taking over my life completely, or I was going to wind up dead. I was the lowest I’ve ever been and the days were so very dark.

I first had contact with turning point (alcohol recovery service) over 15 years ago. I'd then have contact a few more times over the years, seeing the service change but never my drinking. I remember my first group session and how much hope this gave me; I made a couple of friends and they both managed to kick the bottle. But I never did. I’d try and fail, try and fail, time and time again. I’d convinced myself I wasn't that bad.

I’d never really thought of myself as an alcoholic. At this point I didn’t drink in the morning, I never had any physical dependence and I still did everything I needed to do, barely. So why couldn't I kick the habit? 

So I returned to turning point again, not hoping for much. It didn’t start off well and the first person I was paired with there was absolutely no connection for me which I felt was incredibly important when opening up about your life and your struggles. I asked to change workers and was paired with another person whom I never actually met despite scheduling some phone calls and meetings, and was then paired with someone else again where the same thing happened. I was losing hope at this point. The next person, Eleri whom I had met before, invited me to join the 6 week mental health zoom course. I had done this course before but thought I might benefit from attending again. It felt good to talk to similar minded people about my experiences not just with alcohol but mental health too. But something was still missing and I continued to drink.

Once the course had finished I was introduced to Hera. Finally, someone I could connect with, be myself with and felt like she had some life experience! This was so important for me to be able to chat, laugh, cry and be open and honest with my worker. She then recommended another group session. I was apprehensive as although this helped before, nothing ever really changed. But again, the group gave me hope and feeling like I wasn’t alone in my struggles was incredibly comforting. I learned some new information, and felt a drive to get sober again and finding out that I could attend rehab for free was a bit of a turning point; if all else failed again, I had an option, a safety net, a way out of this mess.

So I started the path of trying to see how many days I could go without drinking. I wrote in my drink diary and I could sometimes go days without a drink. I made sure I was blocked from buying alcohol on all delivery platforms like just eat and deliveroo. I made myself go swimming, to exercise and get out more. Little steps. I bought a lock box to lock away my phone, cards, car keys and cash. I asked my partner to stop drinking with me. More little steps. Sometimes I would slip back but I'd started to realise that guilt and shame were some of my triggers, so I was kinder to myself and asked my partner and my mum to be more understanding when I slipped up. I refused to have alcohol in the house, I reduced the amount I was drinking, I discovered coffee and made that my nighttime drink instead. I started going to therapy sessions. Every obstacle that came up I tackled and every time I slipped, I picked myself up again and I carried on. I was finally fighting back.

I can’t remember the exact reason I woke up that monday and just decided this was it but I did, and it stuck. For the first time in over 15 years I didn’t drink a drop for 2 whole months. I couldn’t believe it. I never thought it would happen. I could finally see a way through and I was determined to do it. I started reading books on recovery, watching youtube videos and TEDtalks, reading up about alcohol and its effects both short and long term. I started losing weight, eating healthily and threw myself into my swimming. I was looking after myself for the first time in years and reaping the rewards; I felt good, looked good and had money in the bank. My daughter was never late for school, never missed a day and I was finally present in her life; she had her mum back. Life finally seemed like it made sense again.

I still drink BUT never at home, only when I'm on holiday. For me, NEVER was too much, too infinite, too big. But I know that I will NEVER let myself go back to that dark, depressing, lonely hole that I had got myself into. I cannot and will not, for my daughter as much as myself. Hera told me to play the movie to the end and I still do that now; if I drink what will it look like? What will tomorrow look like? How will I feel? Is it worth it? Definitely not. 

The main things that helped me through my journey:

Blocking myself on delivery platforms i.e. just eat/uber eats/deliveroo. If you email them and explain the situation they can very kindly do this for you.

Not having alcohol in the house.

Not taking my purse with me if I can help it and deleting my bank card off of my phone.

Using a timed lock box for my phone, cards, car keys and cash. You can get these on amazon.

Reading up about alcohol and what it does to your body/brain.

Exercising regularly.

Eating healthily.

Finding a good sobriety app: sober time worked well for tracking.

Changing my perception of alcohol- it’s a toxin and a poison. I did a lot of work in therapy also around when I started drinking, why, and how it’s shaped my relationship with alcohol. Also looking at how society views/normalises alcohol and how it benefits the government!

Reading books on recovery: Catherine Gray, The Unexpected joy of being sober (incredibly informative and signposts you to support websites/ information etc) and Claire Pooley, The sober diaries.

Watching Youtube/TEDtalk videos on recovery: Millie Gooch, why alcohol belongs in the mental health conversation and Janey Lee Grace, Sobriety rocks - who knew!

Abstaining partner. If he drank, I wanted to drink so having that support was essential in the first few weeks. Now he can drink and I'm not bothered.

Find a tasty/comforting alternative. Coffee hit the spot for me, although I have decaf!

Playing the movie to the end.

But the best thing I ever did was to TELL THE TRUTH AND NOT HIDE IT ANYMORE. When I finally decided to have a heart to heart with my partner and my mum and told them every excruciatingly shameful thing I'd done, only then did I finally feel that there was no turning back. That I couldn't let myself and my daughter down, but I couldn't let them down. It was the final nail in the coffin and frankly, a huge relief. NO MORE LIES.

I’m still in the early stages but I'm now hopeful for the first time in my life and alcohol isn’t the main character in my life whilst I'm in the passenger seat. I've gained control, knowledge and power over my addiction and I will continue to do so!",2,1769032990.0,cutdowndrinking,2,1.0,False

Sometimes I would slip back but I'd started to realise that guilt and shame were some of my triggers, so I was kinder to myself and asked my partner and my mum to be more understanding when I slipped up. I refused to have alcohol in the house, I reduced the amount I was drinking, I discovered coffee and made that my nighttime drink instead. I started going to therapy sessions. Every obstacle that came up I tackled and every time I slipped, I picked myself up again and I carried on. I was finally fighting back.

I can’t remember the exact reason I woke up that monday and just decided this was it but I did, and it stuck. For the first time in over 15 years I didn’t drink a drop for 2 whole months. I couldn’t believe it. I never thought it would happen. I could finally see a way through and I was determined to do it. I started reading books on recovery, watching youtube videos and TEDtalks, reading up about alcohol and its effects both short and long term. I started losing weight, eating healthily and threw myself into my swimming. I was looking after myself for the first time in years and reaping the rewards; I felt good, looked good and had money in the bank. My daughter was never late for school, never missed a day and I was finally present in her life; she had her mum back. Life finally seemed like it made sense again.

I still drink BUT never at home, only when I'm on holiday. For me, NEVER was too much, too infinite, too big. But I know that I will NEVER let myself go back to that dark, depressing, lonely hole that I had got myself into. I cannot and will not, for my daughter as much as myself. Hera told me to play the movie to the end and I still do that now; if I drink what will it look like? What will tomorrow look like? How will I feel? Is it worth it? Definitely not. 

The main things that helped me through my journey:

Blocking myself on delivery platforms i.e. just eat/uber eats/deliveroo. If you email them and explain the situation they can very kindly do this for you.

Not having alcohol in the house.

Not taking my purse with me if I can help it and deleting my bank card off of my phone.

Using a timed lock box for my phone, cards, car keys and cash. You can get these on amazon.

Reading up about alcohol and what it does to your body/brain.

Exercising regularly.

Eating healthily.

Finding a good sobriety app: sober time worked well for tracking.

Changing my perception of alcohol- it’s a toxin and a poison. I did a lot of work in therapy also around when I started drinking, why, and how it’s shaped my relationship with alcohol. Also looking at how society views/normalises alcohol and how it benefits the government!

Reading books on recovery: Catherine Gray, The Unexpected joy of being sober (incredibly informative and signposts you to support websites/ information etc) and Claire Pooley, The sober diaries.

Watching Youtube/TEDtalk videos on recovery: Millie Gooch, why alcohol belongs in the mental health conversation and Janey Lee Grace, Sobriety rocks - who knew!

Abstaining partner. If he drank, I wanted to drink so having that support was essential in the first few weeks. Now he can drink and I'm not bothered.

Find a tasty/comforting alternative. Coffee hit the spot for me, although I have decaf!

Playing the movie to the end.

But the best thing I ever did was to TELL THE TRUTH AND NOT HIDE IT ANYMORE. When I finally decided to have a heart to heart with my partner and my mum and told them every excruciatingly shameful thing I'd done, only then did I finally feel that there was no turning back. That I couldn't let myself and my daughter down, but I couldn't let them down. It was the final nail in the coffin and frankly, a huge relief. NO MORE LIES.

I’m still in the early stages but I'm now hopeful for the first time in my life and alcohol isn’t the main character in my life whilst I'm in the passenger seat. I've gained control, knowledge and power over my addiction and I will continue to do so!",1,1769032922.0,dryalcoholics,1,1.0,False

1qjbppp,https://i.redd.it/vlz1vnpjyreg1.png,just shipped my first budgeting app after months of React Native grinding,"hey devs! wanted to share SmartBudget - a budgeting app i finally got live on the App Store after what feels like forever on TestFlight lol.

**the tech stack:**

* React Native (Expo) - switched from bare RN after dealing with CocoaPods hell and Ruby version conflicts. best decision ever
* Supabase for backend/sync
* RevenueCat for subscriptions and premium features
* react-native-calendars for the bill calendar
* custom theme system (light/dark/auto mode that switches at 6pm-6am)

**what it does:** core budgeting features are all free - expense/income tracking, custom categories with icons, budget templates (50/30/20, zero-based, envelope system), subscription tracker with auto-detection, bill calendar, and challenges to keep users motivated.

premium is just the custom template builder and advanced analytics - didn't wanna be another app that paywalls basic features.

**biggest challenges i ran into:**

* navigation bugs between screens took forever to debug
* dark mode theming inconsistencies (ended up converting everything to purple variants lol)
* getting subscription auto-detection working reliably
* integrating RevenueCat was smoother than expected though
* Supabase real-time sync has been solid

**what i learned:**

* Expo makes deployment SO much easier than bare React Native
* RevenueCat handles all the subscription headaches (receipts, restore purchases, etc.)
* Supabase is a game changer for indie devs - PostgreSQL + real-time without the backend hassle
* users want features accessible from multiple entry points (learned this the hard way)
* iterative development with immediate visual feedback >>> trying to build everything at once

honestly still figuring out the whole indie dev/monetization thing. freemium model seems solid but we'll see.

basically it's like if YNAB and Rocket Money had a baby but actually free for the core stuff. i got tired of all these budgeting apps nickel and diming you for basic features so i made sure the main budgeting tools are completely free.

**what it does (free stuff):**

* track all your expenses and income
* create custom categories with tons of icons to choose from
* budget templates (50/30/20 rule, zero-based budgeting, envelope system - all that good stuff)
* subscription tracker that auto-detects your recurring charges
* bill calendar so you actually know when stuff's due
* challenges to keep you motivated (save $100 this month, track expenses for 30 days, etc)
* dark mode that switches automatically at night

**premium features** (gotta pay the bills somehow):

* custom template builder - make your own budget frameworks
* advanced analytics and insights
* priority support

honestly the hardest part was deciding what should be premium vs free.

went with React Native (Expo specifically - saves SO much headache with deployment) and Supabase for the backend. purple theme throughout cause why not

1qjbixd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MonarchCustomTitans/comments/1qjbixd/fractured_chapter_one_welcome_back/,Fractured: Chapter One (Welcome Back),"***Monarch Recruitment Office***

***Edinburgh, Scotland*** 

Sat down within a dark, stuffy office, Danny tapped his fingers on the wooden desk in front of him while sighing impatiently. It had been an odd couple of years for him; the mental stress of his work at Monarch had caught up with him and he needed to take time away. He'd been set up with a Monarch-approved therapist, Dr. Carpenter, and slowly but surely he'd been piecing himself back together. He'd been rebuilding the severed connections with his family, he finally got himself a decent house, he was holding down a regular job. Things were looking up for him, and then just a few days ago, he got a call from Dr. Carpenter asking to meet at Scotland's primary recruitment office for Monarch. 

It had always been a thought in the back of his head, if and when he would return to working for the organisation. He missed all the friends he made at Monarch. There was the group he'd initially bonded with when he joined, there was the team he made while stationed in the Orkney Isles, and there were Dr. Mel Thurmond and Jacob Taylor at Australia's Kronos facility. He'd kept loose contact with some of his Orkney friends, but hadn't heard a thing from Thurmond or Taylor since he was pulled from Monarch. He hoped they were okay, after all that they had been through. 

Getting lost in his thoughts, Danny was pulled back to reality when the office door swung open, briefly letting in a gust of cold air, as a smartly-dressed woman sat herself down across from him. Danny became confused, watching as the woman placed a briefcase on the desk and opened it up. ""Uh, you...aren't Dr. Carpenter."" 

""No, I am not. My name is Cynthia Harkness, I'm a performance evaluator with Monarch."" Her expression was stern, setting out a few documents on the table before closing the briefcase and setting it aside. ""I do apologise, we haven't been able to raise Dr. Carpenter for a couple of days now. I'll be filling in for him today."" 

Danny nodded. ""Oh, okay.""

Cynthia lifted some of the papers to more closely examine them. ""Now, I've been brought to speed on your sessions with Dr. Carpenter, and it seems that you've been making remarkable progress in your recovery. Do you still struggle with nightmares?"" 

He shook his head. ""No, no, I've been doing fine. Mostly good sleep.""

""Good."" Cynthia laid down two sheets of paper and slid them across to Danny. ""Now, after your last session, Dr. Carpenter contacted Castle Bravo to arrange a possible return to Monarch operations for you. He hadn't completed the required paperwork beforehand, so I have taken the liberty of doing so. You'll be assigned to work at the Caillamh Station, one of our newer facilities. They'll help bring you back up to speed, and I'm told you might get to fight dinosaurs."" She flashed a small grin. ""What do you say?"" 

Looking down at the paperwork, Danny took a pen in his hand and prepared to sign. He twirled the pen around before thinking. ""It...does sound good, but I was hoping to maybe be back at one of the places I was at before. Orkney or Kronos?"" 

Cynthia nodded. ""I understand. I do believe that was Dr. Carpenter's intention, but I'm afraid neither option would have been open to you. Dr. Thurmond and Mr. Taylor have been no-contact with Monarch for years now, and the Orkney team are still in a probationary period. No new hires until they've been sufficiently reviewed."" 

""Ah. Okay."" He guessed it would still be a while before he was seeing any familiar faces, though as he pondered, perhaps a new start was the right move. He'd been out of Monarch for a while now, and the list of what's changed in the organisation during that time is probably endless. After a few more seconds of deliberation, Danny signed the papers and slid them back over to Cynthia. 

""Perfect. That's all I needed from you today, so I would suggest going back home and packing up whatever you may want to take. I'll get in touch with the Caillamh Station's director, and in 72 hours we'll have transport arranged for you."" 

The pair stood up, both getting ready to leave. Cynthia and Danny exchanged a handshake before the latter opened the door and walked out. He took a deep breath as he walked outside, headed back home to start packing up whatever he thought he would need for his return to Monarch.

***Kronos Facility, Australia***

In the main observation deck, overlooking the amphibious Titan Aphamotos as it swam around the open ocean pen it was kept in, Elva Treacher stood with a warm cup of coffee in his hand. Things had been good since he took control of the Kronos base a few years ago. He'd weeded out anyone that may have proven to be a risk down the line, he'd established a permanent base in the Tyrant's Den, and he'd made enough money to retire himself and be set for the remainder of his life. 

Of course, Treacher was not Monarch. After the death of its previous leader, Treacher had taken over the eco-terrorist group OutWater, steering the organisation down a different path, one that would guarantee them long-term success so long as everyone played their parts correctly. It'd worked out well so far, Treacher basking in his silent victory every day, knowing Monarch were none the wiser. 

Turning around, Treacher watched his right-hand, Georgia Lambert, approach. Georgia had been embedded within the Kronos base ahead of Treacher's own arrival, to assess the staff and see if there was anything they could exploit for their own gain. She played her part well, and even to this day, she was still keeping a close eye on everyone within the base. ""Miss Lambert, good afternoon. I trust you have some good news.""

Georgia smiled, a bright grin that could fool anyone into thinking whatever she wanted them to think. ""Yes, sir. We're expecting one of Monarch's new battleships to arrive within the next 24 hours, we've got 5 shipments heading out to our clients, and the repairs to the OW1 site are now complete.""

Treacher nodded, grinning. ""Perfect. Last thing we needed were those magma-blooded monsters getting out into the Den."" He glanced back over his shoulder at Aphamotos, watching it retreat to the underwater cave that it would sleep in. ""Any updates on our friends at Monarch?""

She shook her head. ""No...well, mostly no. Thurmond is exactly where you put him, last I heard Taylor is off drinking his days away in Thailand, though I did hear Monarch approve Danny's return to operations.""

""Is he coming back here?"" 

""No. They're sending him off to the Caillamh Station, sir.""

Treacher pondered for a moment before shrugging his shoulders. ""I should be more concerned, I feel, but the team at Caillamh are just children. Bunch of adventure-hungry amateurs that want nothing more than to throw themselves at dinosaurs and see what happens."" He chuckled to himself. ""I say let them. They're no threat, and I'm sure we can have one of our people on the inside keep an eye on him if need be."" 

Georgia nodded, her expression shifting a little. ""Oh! Speaking of Caillamh, that- uh, *thing* you wanted?"" 

""Our operatives managed to find one?"" Treacher seemed surprised. 

""It's in the western bio-lab. They're waiting for you."" 

Finishing his coffee and handing it off to Georgia, Treacher began to leave the room. ""Alright. Keep an eye on things for me. Time to see how valuable this new asset will be to our cause."" 

He walked out of the room, headed down the corridor toward the bio-labs. Georgia was left alone, hearing the distant echoes of Aphamotos as she sat herself down, pulling up video feeds on a monitor and watching the work going on within the Tyrant's Den for herself.

A while back apple put the ability to access “Background Sounds” in Control Center. I played around with it decided the only one I liked was the Rain one. 

So far so good, right?

You know how the noice cancelling still lets a tiny bit of sound through? Last week I’m at a coffee shop and I can hear the coffee shop’s music and eventually I’m like “wtf is this song?” I’m primarily hearing the rain, but I faintly hear this obnoxiously repeating part of a song. It’s a repeating pattern of human voices singing like a funk jazz tone and they’re not saying words. Just going “do do do dooooo, do do doooo dooo do” over and over and over on repeat. Rhythmic, but with good harmonics. It goes on for like 5 hole minutes and then I decide I gotta go ask the barista to change it. It’s like a 5 second loop for 5 whole minutes man! Actually it’s more of a “ahh ahh ahh” and not a doo doo doo. 

I pull out the AirPod to go talk to the guy- and there’s no song playing. It’s dead silent in the coffee shop. WTF?

I put the AirPod back in, get back to work- and I hear it again. It’s IN the rain. I take the AirPod out and it goes away. 

So here we are a week and a half later and every time I turn the rain on, I hear the same faint voices. “Ahhh ah ah-ah….ahhh ah ah-ah-ah” over and over and over. 

Is this a known thing? Have any of you noticed it?",2,1769032366.0,airpods,0,0.75,False
1qjbik1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/1qjbik1/hi_looking_for_new_people_to_talk_to/,Hi! Looking for new people to talk to,"I'm 19 (xy), from the EU, and I'm studying biology at uni. I don’t really have hobbies; all I do is eat, study, sleep, and occasionally wash the dishes. And for those wondering, I barely play video games - maybe a couple of indie games a year and an occasional 2-week Minecraft phase.

I'm quite (maybe a lot) shy. I rarely reach out to people first. I often suffer from anxiety & panic attacks, I have paranoia, I tend to overthink a lot, and I have anger issues - I can get annoyed by basically anything. Why? I don't know\~

I'm introverted and have had a pretty small social circle for several years.

I'm looking for people to talk to about random stuff - from +18 to \~20ish\~ years old, ideally uni students in the same or similar fields. I tend connect best with people who are similar to me personality-wise; I struggle communicating with people who are very different and those convos tend to die instantly & I'd rather avoid that.

I enjoy dark & edgy humor, memes and I love irony. I love arguing with people just to annoy them for no reason whatsoever.

I'm also obsessed with privacy; I don't like talking about my personal life too much so I never give out personal information & I have an unreasonable fear of getting doxxed, so please don't ask <>

1qjbh2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1qjbh2y/my_lost_years_part_12/,My Lost Years. Part 1/2,"Hi, I've split this into two posts because it's very long. I'm using a two-and-done throwaway account here. I’ve needed to get this off my chest for a long time — this is a culmination of things that I’ve been wanting to dump onto a page. I’m finally ready to post all of this. I was raised to keep all of this inside, so there’s a lot. But I think getting it out is good. These are what I call my Lost Years — the ones that have disappeared and that I still, to this day, wish I could get back.

It started in childhood. My father was emotionally manipulative, angry, violent to me, and, to my mother, sexually manipulative. From an early age, punishments for minor things — or things I didn’t even do — were met with a violent reaction, and gaslighting from my mother, who he turned into a participant in this. He would tell her all the horrible things that I did — things that actually never happened, but things that he had made up in his head — and send her to me for extra discipline. I had thrown things, I had used bad words, I was the one who took extra portions of the dinner. She would come to me with these accusations and I was left not knowing what happened to cause her feeling this way — because it hadn’t happened.

But to me, he was violent. He hit me frequently, and often for nothing. Just whatever made him mad in the moment. When my mother saw that he hit me, she told him to stop. He didn’t, instead waiting until she wasn’t home or until we were alone to punish me for any infractions he had perceived. Many times these things were small — taking an extra cookie (I did take extra cookies, just not on the level that he wanted everyone to believe I did) or using a new curse word, and he would respond with violence. Smacking my mouth, spanking me and throwing me on the bed to beat me with his belt were frequent, although what I remember most from him was this sense of our rage, of pure anger. Even other punishments, like “washing” my mouth out with soap for using curse words were done angrily and violently — the bar of soap was jammed in my mouth forcefully enough that I remember the feeling of soap shavings from where he had held my teeth shut around it. Of course, he was permitted to yell and curse at me and my mother as much as he wanted.

That same double standard extended to my siblings. I was five and eight when my brother and sister were born and seeing them not punished with nearly the severity that I was treated to made me think that there was something uniquely wrong about me. There was a huge difference between my parents flicking off the power switch when the rest of the family left so that I wouldn’t play video games, versus them allowing my siblings to play for as long as they wanted when my parents were out of the house. Swearing was far less harshly treated with them — and on several accounts, I was the one punished for my siblings’ bad words. Things were given to them with ease (like a Wii and Nintendos), whereas things I got were conditional— they had to be used in certain ways, or it was because my parents (most frequently my father) wanted me to do something specific with what they gave me. A repurposed laptop came with the condition that I would use it for school assignments and submit to checks on my browsing history, earbuds came with the condition that I don’t listen to music from my computer speakers. Oftentimes, I was punished for things out of my control. When my sister was less than a year old, she woke up from a nap and, in the space of fifteen seconds, had stuck her finger in the treadmill where my mom was running. Her finger was cauterized. I grabbed her and pulled her out, shouting for my mom to stop. I remember my father’s reaction — storming downstairs, the moment his eyes locked on mine, and the way he charged at me. He grabbed me, threw me into the door, shoved me outside, then came out later and slammed my head into the window and pointed my head to the open bathroom door where I could see my mother bandaging my sister’s finger, telling me “You did this.” He frequently  favored physically throwing me out of the house for seemingly nothing many times — whether it was this time or him throwing me out of the skeletal frame of our then-house extension that he was building with my uncle, or on my birthday when I was reading a book and hadn’t heard him. From an early age, I could feel that he saw me as competition for my mother — for her time and energy. This was later confirmed when my mother told me that he had said as much to her.

My introduction to what was nominally defined as good sex was through my parents —although it was anything but. During this time, we all lived in a small house, and I would wake up to my parents having sex in the bed next to mine. As my mom would explain to me, this was because my father wanted it, and because he would otherwise drop emotional bombs on the house (her phrasing) if she didn’t. This message was repeated often, and it instilled in me a message: sex is not something that I should want. If I **do** ask for it, I’m asking something horrible of someone. It is something that has haunted me for years and has become so subconscious that whenever I have any kind of sexual desire, I’m overwhelmed with guilt and shame.

My father also engaged in financial exploitation, running his own mother’s credit card — which she had given him exclusively for his fishing boat — into thousands of dollars of debt for wine. The alcohol fueled rage would come out at home, against my mom when they clashed, and he would rhetorically corner her, and make her see fault in a situation that she never had. Against me, it was violence. When the boat failed, he claimed that everyone else but him was responsible. These false misrepresentations carried on: the money to extend the family house that he claimed came from his retirement alone came from (it was my mom’s as well). According to him, I was watching porn when I crashed his computer with a virus and he made sure that everyone knew it. Except I was watching the mid-season 3 finale of Heroes on a site with a lot of viruses. And yes, he knew this too.

In 2015, against the wishes of everyone in the family, he ordered seeds for weed plants (it had become legal in our state), and began growing them in the back room of the house, continuing even after I developed an anaphylactic reaction to the weed when the buds began to bloom. To him, I was lying, I hated him, and I was just saying things to force him to stop growing — which he didn’t. For years, this situation continued, and eventually he moved the plants into a greenhouse that he had been constructing. 

In 2016, repressed memories started coming back to me. I had just moved across the country for college for that fall semester and memories of sexual violence I had survived came back. One incident was from when I was seven. It lead to me dropping out of school and moving back home partway during the Spring 2017 semester. Why the memories were repressed is something that I don’t know and, frankly, hate to this day. I can assume that it’s a defensive mechanism that my brain has done since childhood, as many of the specific instances of my dad being violent were also repressed until I entered therapy. By the spring of 2017, I had developed anorexia and had gone from 215 pounds to 137. I spent the next two and a half years at home, recuperating, fighting back my eating disorder, and trying to pursue music composition at the local university there instead of at a fancy, expensive school. It was a time that I spent mostly sequestered by myself, feeling less able to make friends as I fought the anorexia away and tried to regain some semblance of stability in my life. I found joy, **finally**, in writing music again. I slowly opened up, spending time again with one of the few friends I’d kept in touch with post-high school and I still remember the moments of getting pizza with her, hanging out, and the friendship that we had.

In Spring of 2019, I blitzed out a 137-page screenplay based on my mental state during recovery. It lifted my mental state in a way I didn’t know possible. It was also after this that, for the very first time in my life, I felt comfortable and able to date and, more frighteningly given my past, hook up with people.  I was only allowed a phone on my 20th birthday in 2016 and my parents maintained control over my phone for years, so I still remember carefully switching out the email on my AppleID so that I would have more control over my phone’s privacy. It was terrifying and, yet, liberating at the same time. But finally, with my father spending half his week in another city, my mother taking a more hands-off approach, and my mental health finally — **finally** opening back up, I was able to rediscover confidence in myself, in many different ways. 

And no, it wasn’t just sexually. I have fond memories of that spring semester. I’ve struggled with extreme motion sickness throughout my life and couldn’t be in a car without clamping down on my wrist, but I was able to bike around. By that time, I had become a strong cyclist, and could average 22 mph on a mountain bike. I remember biking back from orchestra practice at nighttime (albeit through snow on a fat tire bike), finishing up my last music projects at the University, and, when I had down time, watching The 100 and, what would become one of my favorite shows, The OA.

Strange things stick out from that time — from the last concert I ever had at the Concert Hall, to the 11 and a half minute piece I wrote for a string orchestra that my orchestra instructor called for the entire orchestra to read in what he called a “drive-by read through”. The way that the April sun made the snow sparkle and gleam as it dripped and melted. Little things that I haven’t forgotten or that, today, still mean the world to me. 

But my local university didn’t have the film scoring program I wanted, so I returned to the same school across the country in Fall 2019. It was somewhat frightening, but also somewhat exciting, being back, living off-campus, swinging from class to class. But there was more sexual trauma to follow — an on-again, off-again partner who really didn’t care what he did to me if I said no, and, in a rash split decision that, as I have felt, was beyond stupid, an encounter where a guy did what he wanted to me. I was terrified of the response if I pushed back — and, deep down, I felt afraid. That I wasn’t there to put up a fight — much like my mom told me that she didn’t all those years ago. I had no agency.

Then there was E., an emotionally manipulative ex who I met the week before finals at the Ben and Jerry’s in a local shopping mall next to the school we both attended. Our relationship picked up after we had both returned from winter break, but even then, there were warning signs that I should’ve listened to. E. never let me finish a sentence and talked over me every time. I couldn’t raise my voice in excitement. He only wanted to talk about his games and the songs he was writing, not anything that I was working on. I would schlepp myself and my homework over to his place for a day out of each weekend, but he never wanted to come and see me. And he didn’t want to hang out for the rest of the week, otherwise. But I was, at the time, overjoyed to be with someone who even considered me as being worth talking to. Every time I left his place, I would feel what I would only call a “Strain”, a pull on my mental state that would dampen everything down to my body’s functions — I would walk slower, I couldn’t run for as long or as fast at the gym. My mind was slowly becoming a nervous wreck.

What would become the week before COVID lockdowns, I returned from E.’s as a jittering, emotional wreck and with no memory of what had happened the night before. I assumed it was the Strain and the growing fear over COVID that, at that time, was threatening to shut the country down. I tried to force myself into what would be the last week of school as COVID was descending on the country, but running felt like I was moving legs of lead. My homework was only partially completed. I couldn’t sleep with my arms above my head and spent much of my days inside my apartment. 

But COVID happened. The lockdowns were painful. My school shut down, classes went online, and we were still charged full tuition. Outside of school, the small business shops that I loved window-shopping in shut down — pizza shops, weird local secondhand stores, and more. I used to walk through the Whole Foods in my area just to look at the bakery items, and yet this was off the table now. Furthermore, I couldn’t talk with the people I usually talked with. E., in what were becoming his restrictive, once-a-day texts, lead me to believe I was the one tearing the relationship apart, insisting that I needed therapy — and celebrating me getting a therapist as though it was a weight off his shoulders — then only occasionally texting me if I was “nice enough” to him or talked about the right things — again, the things that he was interested in. Never anything about my interests.

I jumped at the opportunity for any human connection. I reached out to friends and formed a Google Hangout book writing club and I began to write. It was the continuation of a book that I had written the first two chapters to in class. It would go on to pass over 90,000 words.

Over the summer, I broke up with E. Some COVID regulations eased and I got a tattoo, a slightly modified saying from one of my favorite TV shows, on my left arm, and I was able to sleep with my arms above my head again. I started a FWB situation with a guy who lived a floor above me. I kept writing. A friend needed top surgery — getting their tits lopped off — and on August 2nd, I flew down to Florida for 10 days to help them recover. It was a welcome reprieve from the lockdown measures and the extreme snitch culture of the city where I was located at the time, and my brain eased up. It felt like a weight had been lifted. 

When I got back, my head was functional again — but not for long. I still remember going up to my FWB’s room — Room 503 of the same building I lived in — and how he ‘celebrated’ my return by doing things I didn’t even want, well beyond what I was comfortable with in that moment. I told him to stop when he did things that I didn’t want, but he ignored everything.

That night, a memory came back to me. A week before lockdowns. E. and I had gone to an Italian ice cream and gelato place, had gone back to his place, where he pinned me down on his bed and forced himself on me. And he had pinned my arms above my head. I finally understood that this was why it was so difficult for me to sleep with my arms above my head, and why getting a tattoo had helped.

My brain had a way of blocking these memories out — of shunting it in the same way that I had accepted much of the violence from my father in my youth. That this was “just the way it was” and I had no choice but to deal with it. It was after this that I began to challenge the mindset that I was just an object. That I had to just ignore everything and the way that it made me feel, and that I was allowed to not like the things that were done to me — even when people pushed past my objections. The relationship with E., the other, brief relationship with the other student before that, and the FWB situation all culminated in me beginning to more seriously re-examine the way that I related to others, and the lack of value I had placed in myself.

I began rewatching *The 100*. This time, I went beyond S5E1. There was a reunion episode between all the major characters where I found myself inexplicably crying. There was a familiarity. As I watched more of the series, I began to flash back to other points in my life — points just a year before. I could still see the sun blasting bright off the dripping, melting snow outside as I had watched the show in 2019. I could feel how exciting running around at the University back home was, writing and biking. Even at that time, it was something I desired more than I realized. I wanted to return to exactly those moments. Things felt more hopeful then, more possible.

And I also knew that returning to those conditions would not benefit me. So, for the time, I chose to stick with my current course.

Fall 2020 semester rolled around. Same thing, under lockdown, full tuition, but this time, the course load was more fun. But we began to learn CuBase, the Digital Audio Workstation critical for my school’s film scoring program, and it was exciting. My days began to develop a ritual. Wake up, run, make coffee and launch into CuBase. It was exhilarating. I sucked at inputting notes from the keyboard into the program— why after all, I’m a violinist, for fuck’s sake, I can’t do such challenging things with my hands! I contracted COVID in October and had to take a week off as the virus hit hard, but I did recover. 

At the same time, I was growing increasingly starved for human connection. As the semester rolled to a close, my landlord allowed even more weed smoking in a no-smoking building. Before, it had been brief instances of smoking and I’d struggled getting him to enforce the no-smoking policy, but given that it was occasional, I was able to survive. But throughout November and December, he allowed weed smoking to explode within the building, and I was routinely going into anaphylactic shock. So I broke the lease and moved into a roommate-less apartment, where I was truly alone. I spent the Christmas of 2020 holed up in a new apartment and waiting for the Spring semester, wishing that there were people from school who were willing to have friendships outside of class.

Enter my latest ex. My longest relationship to date and, by far, the most damaging. We’ll call him N.

We met in early 2021. At first, it was messaging on Grindr, because where else was I going to talk with anyone else in that city? From the very beginning, there were signs that should have immediately stopped me — but, in contradiction to where I was months ago, my need for some kind of connection had completely starved me into desperation. This is not to excuse me staying in the relationship, but rather to understand where my head was at in that time, and, hopefully, to remember what signs to look for inside myself in the future.

N. moved in with me on the ninth day, needing a place to crash while he worked out his living situation. The relationship developed quickly after that; we spent almost every moment together, even in the moments where I needed my own time to prepare for the upcoming semester, he was always there, and always loaded with questions. He would ask how I was able to do what I did composing music and writing stories. He would go through my stories — including a feature-length screenplay I had written in 2019. When I asked for space to complete my work, he took it as personal attack. He wanted an open relationship but didn’t see fit to tell me that he was seeing someone else until after that guy had ghosted him in late January of that year. 

Were there positive parts about the relationship? Of course. He was very sharing, very giving, offering to pay for things like a huge pizza order (we both loved pizza at 11 in the evening or at midnight), caring for me when I was down or crying. Even in my connection-starved state, I would’ve told him to fuck off if there was no kindness at all. But unfortunately at that time, I saw even the slightest kindness as all the light in the world. And also, at that time, I hadn’t yet understood the connection between my upbringing and the way I responded to the slightest kindness— even if it was done in manipulation.

Apart from that, it was frequently hell. He would yell and shout at me, for things as insignificant as putting sour cream in a bowl of chili or eating a slice of pizza when it “wasn’t hot enough”. He would obsess over me — frequently smiling as I was getting my coffee or getting my food. When I asked him what was going on, he said he was watching me because I’m beautiful or because I “act cute”. At one point, he attempted to control the amount of coffee I was drinking, claiming that he was “looking out for me” by monitoring my caffeine intake. I was also “too nice” in the way I communicated with him and with other people. In his words, too overflowing, too friendly, too “open”  in my communication style to others. He wanted me to say less words, talk less. Frequently when we were out in public, he would show up beside me, facing the opposite direction, eyes scanning out over the other people, telling me that I needed to be more withdrawn, because the other people were watching. Take the gym, for example. It was previously a place I was able to enjoy my workouts. I was working out one day, when he came up beside me, looking out at other people like he was monitoring for threats and whispering that I had poor form. He would push me to do certain exercises and have a certain warm up/cool down routine — and to do it all with him.

N. suffered a back injury in February of 2021 that left him recuperating and me stuck doing all of the work around the place. He beat himself up over it, disowning his “weak, pathetic, worthless piece-of-trash” body (his words) and ranting about how he wanted to do himself in. He always appeared cured by my intervening and pleading with him not to — at least until the cycle unfolded all over again. Regardless, I still did all the physical labor around the house. And he would melt down every day, calling me over to help him for even the smallest things — and no, he wasn’t bedridden. He could bend down, he could get things or himself. He just wanted me there. This didn’t become obvious to me until I began seriously analyzing his behavior years later — which was something I was too exhausted to do then.

For him, having faced discrimination in the city we lived because of his race — and particularly in the gay dating, hookup and relationship scenes, were all things to be weaponized. Because I’m “white enough”, then I “should”, in his view, be able to interact with anyone I wanted. This is despite the fact that I have faced weird questions in that city related to my ethnicity (until living in this city, I’ve always been just…white, but apparently not enough for this place) and, especially, plenty of unwanted comments around my gender. I don’t feel either male or female. It’s been a journey figuring it out, and by the time I ended up with N., I had been struggling with feeling outside of either male or female genders for a long time but had been more comfortable with calling myself non-binary for more than a year. All of this to say, that within queer circles there is a hierarchy, and, in this city in particular, I was lower on the pecking chain.

None of that mattered to N. I was able to “shut it off”, according to him (I don’t understand what that means) and “pass” if I “needed to”. He was very sympathetic towards me when I had previously told him about the threats of violence I’d received because of my gender identification/presentation — even over something as menial as painting my nails blue — but those sympathies faded when he was on a roll about how I “didn’t know anything” about what it was like to be denied hookups because of my gender (and even in the times where I’ve overcome my fears about sex, I actually do know that is like, especially in that city). In his words, he was “allowed” to be on my Grindr and message guys through it because he was “conducting a social experiment” to see if he got more attention when he used my profile. The fight to keep him off my phone was long-running, but I eventually succeeded — but, as he told me, if I wanted to establish a boundary, it was extremely “white” and “western” of me. He noticed every queer person whose eyes lingered a little longer on me in the street, and they became, in his eyes, a “racist” because they wouldn’t “even deign” to look at someone like him, if they “ever even noticed” him. This line was constant. The rants to me about hookups and sex were so frequent that I remember very clearly how he would tell me that I didn’t “know anything” about being denied a hookup.

And that brings us to everything sex-related. Because on top of that, this is where my parents’ horrible sexual relationship comes back into play. There’s a way that your perception of the world is shaped when you’re young and your parents are your vehicle to understanding why things work the way they do. For me, my mother was the one I was closest to, and as such I adopted many of her views on these things —because I knew that what was going on between my parents was wrong. The problem was that I learned it as something that applied to all sexual situations, not specific to a sexual situation.  And one of the major issues that I learned from her were her views on sex. It’s impossible to say how damaging those views were, particularly for a young child to hear. Ever since my youth, I’ve only known sex to be just that: a requirement, something that’s wrong, bad and Very Not Good if you ask it of others, but something that **can** be asked of you. I feel as though I impose on others when I have sexual desires, even though they are completely consensual between me and whoever I’m with. Even to this day, when there’s something sexually that I like, I still feel an almost thought-canceling wall shame and guilt rush up for even **thinking** it. It shuts my brain down. It’s taken me a long time to even get comfortable with saying that a person is attractive, let alone be comfortable with any sexual action I was in.

By 2021, add to that what was already by that time multiple rapes, and I was living in a dark headspace.

One of the side effects of this is makes getting hard nearly impossible. I have to be completely comfortable with someone, to trust that they will tell me if I do anything that they don’t want — but know what it is that we’ll be doing. Otherwise the fear keeps me immobilized and trapped within my head.

And N. did not make this easier. He made it much more difficult. Because for all of his talk about how it was apparently much easier hooking up, N. would frequently brag to me about his sexploits, often contrasting them with mine. He would only then acknowledge my fears anxieties related to hooking up when he needed to mock them, knowing full well my history with sex. (And no, for the record, I don’t like the constant bragging about sexploits. I find it unnecessary, and, personally, it always makes me compare my sex life with others in a way that’s very painful.) No small part of this comes from N. On several times, he would tell me, “You’re hot, you could have anybody you wanted, but you don’t.”, stripping the context of my childhood and my numerous sexual assaults away — all of which he had pried from me. He knew about them because, on my worse days, he could tell something was wrong, and he was only too quick to step in and console me, asking to hear about what was causing my depression in detail. His indignation and rage at the way I’d been treated disappeared the moment I had issues in bed. He would mock me for not being able to get hard. Some of his hookups, he waived in my face, ones that would become relevant. Featured in his constant retellings were one with someone from his work in 2016 who he met, who helped him “prepare” for his overseas year — someone who had caused what he called his “creative life crisis” — but it didn’t stop him from hooking up with this guy (incidentally, as he would tell me, I was supposed to rectify his creativity crisis). Another instance, when he was overseas, he hooked up with a guy in his bar. That latter incident was particularly damaging because he waived it in my face so many times, contrasting it with the insecurities that I already had. In 2021, we went to NYC for his birthday and N. made me carry all of our computers around for 14 hours, from 8AM to 10PM, and he expected me to plan the entire day. After 10PM, I collapsed, exhausted and not having eaten for 14 hours. N. mocked me and compared my exhaustion to his bar hookup story. All of this lead to my sex-related insecurities exploding, to which N. vacillated between encouraging me to go out and hook up — every time peppering in his own sexploits and claiming that it was easy while knowing full-well why it wasn’t for me — and telling me how, because I was, in his view, “hot”, then that meant I could get taken by anyone else. On this point, he shifted between telling me that I was “lucky"" to be “so hot” and have “so much opportunity” and being terrified about what me leaving him would mean for him, never mind that it would take much more than a hookup for me to want to be in a relationship with him. It was constant.

N.’s obsession with my writing and music composition was also constant. Because I was in online classes for the spring 2021 semester (my college hadn’t yet reopened), he was able to frequently listen in on my classes and he would watch me compose music and demand that I tell him what I’m doing. If there were hot guys in my online zoom class, he would try and zoom in on them, taking screen grabs over my protests.

And if I refused? He was worthless, he was awful, he wasn’t worth living. It was the ultimate proof that he wouldn’t amount to anything. He thought he might need to end himself. He said all of that, and more, for hours on end. I would spend whole evenings, well past midnight, talking him down when he felt low. Always walking on eggshells because the same person who presented as the most fragile, breakable innocent person, unable to function without someone to console him, could turn on a dime to wield his sexploits over my head. Usually, talking about his sexploits would make him feel better. 

This lead to me, over time, losing the desire to create stories and music, as it became wrapped in the messaging he had slung my way. 

And the whole time, I stuck by N. My mind was far too malleable at the time, far too open to others’ narratives about who I was, who I should be, and where I ought to go from there.

N. took over my time throughout my online Spring 2021 semester and a class I had to re-take over the Summer of 2021. Over that summer, we went to visit my family back home for a month. He was on much of his best behavior, but that quickly faded when we flew back across the country and back to our apartment. In mid-August, he pushed us to go see The Suicide Squad, demanded I make a sandwich, and, instead of splitting it, guilt-tripped me that I hadn’t made two, and ate more than half of it before “offering” to share some with me, demanding I let him eat most of it. He demanded that we go kayaking after, which I said no to. He chose to go alone and, as I left, he brought up the bar hookup story. That threw me into a bad enough funk that I was spaced out and was irresponsive the rest of the day. At least until he got back from kayaking and grabbed me, yelled and cursed at me for not being responsive to him.

I should’ve ended things there. But between his insistence that I’m actually the one who doesn’t know what I’m doing and his frequent weaponized fragility, I stayed with him.

Compounding all the problems was E., my rapist ex from pre-lockdown 2020. When the college re-opened in the Fall 2021 semester, E. was back on campus, and I did my best to avoid him. I already had a no-contact order taken out on him, but it was when I was planning to move forward with an investigation into the assault that things got difficult — the questioning I received from members of the school departments was so aggressive and doubtful and dismissive that I was hit with flashbacks, and I had to take the next couple days off. I knew I wouldn’t be able to go through with it and keep up this semester, so I chose to not proceed with the investigation.

Another curveball: N. would continue to call me up when I was on campus and demand that I share what I’m doing with him and let him write music to my assignments with me. If I said no, he was suicidal. I wouldn’t want to come back and find him dead now, would I? His life, and his happiness, and everything of his well-being, depended on me and what I could do for him. Again, his 2016 creativity crisis caused by this hookup work friend (who we’ll call J.) was mine to rectify. The semester continued through with more of this, and in mid-November, I made plans to leave. It was under council from my mom that I ended up staying with N. — every time that I would plan on leaving, she would encourage my to stay with him. Looking back on it now, I **still** had no clear sense of self enough to stand up for my needs and to enforce what should have been a necessary boundary.

N., seeking to not renew his lease, charged me with finding a new place, which I found in December of that year. When he tried to steal a mattress from his prior rental, his roommate threatened him with a police report — and I was stuck with taking the mattress back. Later on, my mother again counseled me against walking away from N. after he screamed and cursed at me on a bus ride to the gym. 

In January of 2022, N. got a job offer that transferred us to a different city as I was in my final semester. He wanted me to come along and, as E. was still on-campus at the time, I agreed, and took the rest of my classes online. In that time, I had to move all of our luggage, pieces of our furniture and all of our belongings, for a three-month lease apartment that would round out with my final, now-online semester at school. Of course, once we got there and settled in, N.’s schedule took precedence. On the two days he worked in-person at the office, nothing could interrupt the time that he needed to get there. I had to be quiet, I couldn’t use the bathroom within certain times of him showering, and he needed me to get his clothes and food ready to go to work. Over time, this quickly became a routine, and one I fell into. The weekends were for partying. Going out to clubs and brunches. I had to come along, because he wanted to “allow” me “to experience these things”. Because, in his mind, I otherwise wouldn’t do it myself. While this is largely true and, on some level, I’m happy to have gone, I wish we had gone far less than we did — and I wish I had gone with **different** people. N. continued to weaponize my insecurity about his overseas bar hookup story to imply that he might meet some guy at a bar or a club and screw there, implying that if I came along, he wouldn’t do such a thing. I look back on those moments now and wonder how much it would have been different had I gone to clubs and bars with someone different. Even writing that wish now gives me a mixture of guilt and regret. Call that regret Stockholm Syndrome, or whatever else you want to, but it’s a testament to how thoroughly I had allowed my mind to deteriorate.

And at the same time, N. still wanted to know how I composed music and wrote, and my final semester projects were dragged out or delayed as he attempted to insert himself into the process. At the same time, our three-month lease was coming to a close, and I was to find our second apartment, which he said he couldn’t find, being overloaded with work. I eventually found a place with affordable rent, and finished up my final projects with N. a near-constant presence in my life. I walked at graduation, although there were still credits in my degree that needed to be transferred around. I lost interest in pursuing that and getting my degree as N.’s needs grew. More making food, more keeping the apartment clean, more ways that I should be keeping the apartment clean, when and how.

Over the summer, N. invited a from their shared year overseas at the same school to stay with us in our new apartment. We’ll call her C. After one of my frequent arguments with N., C. took me aside and told me that N. was not the same person she knew when they were in school together. At the end of July, 2022, C. rallied me into confronting him in what became a huge, hours-long sit-down, that ended in N. finally committing to treating others like human beings.

I know. I still should’ve gotten out of there. The brief respite that I had after the sit-down was gradually eaten away in the months after. N. spent most of August traveling, and C. left at the beginning of September. After C. left, N. started pushing for me to go out with him more, and my energy drained further. I found myself retreating, cutting off contact with the few friendships I had. N. took up more time, and more of my energy, and wanted to involve himself in more of these friendships. He would warn me that if I didn’t involve him in these friendships, then I was isolating him, and it was unfair to him. So I retreated. I withdrew from these friends, didn’t even send a message asking for time and space. My anxiety exploded and I wanted to be a part of the world less and less. Most of my time was spent cleaning and cooking — N. would frequently be upset if I made too much of a mess cooking — messes would devolve into lectures about how careless and sloppy I was, how I needed to think more. Even something as simple as food spilling over onto the stovetop was enough to set him off, despite the fact that I would be the one cleaning it up later.

so i decided to take a step back and start from the bottom. 2 years later i've read over 20 books and lost 20kg. here are the 9 stupidly simple habits that transformed my life one tiny step at a time:

* **Habit 1 - Read 10 pages every morning.** not 50. just 10 pages with your coffee. that's about 12-15 books a year.
* **Habit 2 - 10 push ups the moment i wake up.** before anything else. it’s about proving to yourself you can do hard things first thing.
* **Habit 3 - Control the screen.** honestly, a friend invited me to test **the app FeedLite** to remove reels and shorts from my feed recently. it’s been a few weeks and the results are pretty positive—it makes staying disciplined with these other habits way easier bc i'm not wasting mental energy on mindless scrolling.
* **Habit 4 - Writing down gratitude.** takes 2 minutes. rewires your brain to notice good things instead of only problems.
* **Habit 5 - Drinking water before anything.** 2 glasses. your brain is dehydrated after 8 hours of sleep. feed it water first, stimulants second.
* **Habit 6 - Daily walks after a meal.** better digestion, improved mood. plus you'll accidentally get 8,000+ steps a day.
* **Habit 7 - Phone in another room at night.** charge it somewhere else. use an actual alarm clock. better sleep, better mornings.
* **Habit 8 - Learn one tiny thing every day.** a word, a fact, a skill. anything. watch a 5-minute tutorial or read a wikipedia page.
* **Habit 9 - Plan the day before.** spend 5 minutes writing down your top 3 priorities for the next day. wake up with purpose.

it took some time to fully integrate all these habits but i'm so glad i pushed through. i hope this motivates some of u to start small too.",5,1769032219.0,Habits,2,1.0,False

(I’ve started a cafe),"I’ve just started a cafe but, even though I have invested in quality, I don't have as many customers as I expected.

Some people compliment me on some of my products, but I've only seen 1-2 customers come back multiple times.

Earnings are stable, but not seeing a loyal customer base and not being those earnings high anyway, I'm having some doubts.

How common is going to a cafe for fika? I don't know if it is more a home/office thing (90% of my clients are over 75).

What time should I open and what time should I close? 
I've tried long hours. Hardly anyone comes before 11:00. Between 1:00 and 2:00 PM, it's often completely empty. Between 2:00 and 3:00 PM, however, there are so many people that sometimes some leave because they can't find free tables. Again, no one between 3:00 and 4:00 PM. After 5:00 PM, it's very rare.

And is it one thing to have a trusted cafe or is it more common to alternate? (there are only two other places where I live)

As for coffee, I've focused on quality Italian coffees. But I'm starting to feel like it's too niche. Would it be worthwhile to also have a mainstream Swedish coffee?
 (I don’t drink coffee myself, so if you have any brands to recommend, suggestions are welcome)

Should I add savory options? What kind?

My name is Angel and I will be living in Japan until June. I will be attending university in Osaka. To preface, I have lived in Japan before, for university, for about a year and I am returning again next week. I would really like to meet new people and make some friends as, embarrassingly to admit, I have really struggled with that during my previous time here. I thought it would be a good start to put myself out there by posting on this subreddit.

(Though if this is not the appropriate place for that, please kindly let me know!)

Here’s some things about myself:

• I’m 22

• Lived in Japan before (been to places such as Tokyo, Nikko, Nagano (I love snowboarding/skiing), Nagoya, all over Osaka and Kyoto, Nara, Hyogo, Fukuoka, Oita, Hokkaido, and Okinawa

• I’m currently job hunting (facing many difficulties I don’t even know where to start)

• I love coffee and cafe hopping

• I enjoy trying new restaurants

• My Japanese level is around N3 but with friends I would say N2 as I’m more comfortable talking in casual (I would like to practice more)

For residents who have struggled finding people to connect with here, how did you go about it? What are some good events are places to go to for people who move here alone?

**The thousand mile**, **blank stare**

Where was I, Rage filled and pissed, on the couch texting and calling until Ding, I receive a text. Not much, just 'I'm fine, everything's ok'. WHAT!?! That's it? After 36hours!!! Now I know, I know for a fact she there? she's seen ALL my messages? Chosen to Ignore, with complete disregard for her own cheap thrills. 

I'm becoming manic by this point. I should mention that during this time, I've got in my car, grabbed some candy for the nose and I'm just completely locked in. Sobriety left back in 2025 without so much as a farewell. I had no plan here, there's no reasoning. Just anger, focus and desperation, one thought being, how do I get the response that's never coming and a desire to find out the truth I'd never want to hear.

My recollection of this evening is mostly a blur, something I am thankful for today. It was hours of texting and obsessing. I think I drove around, went past a few of her friends homes, looking to see what I could find. Eventually, I left and just went back home in the late night but before I did I got her car keys, jumped in her car and simply parked it a few houses down as a final attempt to receive an answer. I know what you're all thinking, WTF man, but logic had been removed a long time ago,  my thought process was, she'll come home eventually, need her car and be forced to text me. At least this way I get to know when she returns. So then I leave, heading home with no answer, zero change in emotions and destined to obsess all night long which is exactly what I did. With no sleep, I'm distraught and most likely spent the night scrolling beside all you guys here on reddit for distraction.

  
You reach a certain point in the morning, I believe it to be anywhere past 2am when the world is asleep, where you just give up. Annoyed about the relief she might feel as she's finally left alone. 

Sun now coming up in the early mornings of January 2nd. Its been 2 days since communication with me or her kids. No idea where she has been. I get a thought. Please remember now, that I parted ways with logic along time ago. Thought 1 - she works today. she starts at 8:30am she will need to come home for her car. Thought 2 - how do I in a reasonable enough way, get back to that house and convince my parents to watch my boys a little longer? Got it!.... the letter! The letter that's become so irrelevant NEEDS to be retrieved I tell them. I need to go grab the letter before its read and I'll be right back. Grab my keys and I go.

The drive from hell, once again - Driving from my parents house to our place, 15min, has become the longest and heaviest drive these last 2 days. Every moment filling you with the level of anger that places you on the 5 o'clock news. Exhaustion from running scenarios through your head. The worst one's are when you get stuck on the scenarios where she's innocent, where there's a reasonable and justified explanation to all of this, with undeniable proof, where happiness and trust is brought instantly back ending the nightmare finally. These are the thoughts you physically need to shake out of your head, snapping back to your own horrible reality. 

Pulling up to her house around 8:30, still no one, car still a few house's down. See has still not returned. I don't even know what I am doing at this point, I freeze for several minutes as if I'm afraid to feel the change in temperature between the warm car and the cold frosted morning. I do it, walk in the house rip up the letter and tidy some for my mess from the night before, stalling in hopes she returns. 'This was a bust, another pointless trip.' I think. Time to walk back to the car and leave. With something stopping me... I have to give it more time, I have to see how she gets dropped off, by who. A friend? An Uber? Lets find out.

I now sit in a spot where I can see everyone coming into our neighborhood. I know my ex, she has zero awareness, she wouldn't even think to look out for my car. Minutes now feeling like hours and I want to give it up, I think of leaving every second, I just cant... as I wait, heart racing with as cars come and go. I fidget, sweat and question just about everything, anger thankfully protecting me from my tears..... This becomes a real life slow motion effect. THERE SHE IS! I see her! Finally after 2 days she coming toward me. I can see her in the side mirror. She look rested and healthy just smiling and laughing, talking away like the torment that she's gifted me as the world transitioned into a new year meant nothing. 

This is the part I wasn't ready for, the enviable. Who was in the drivers seat?? To this day they remain a couple and I still don't know more than A first name. Here's some random guy dropping my wife of after 2 days of being MIA!!. Male ego fucking rising up ready to crash like a tsunami. I put my car in drive and pull up instantly, directly behind them unsure yet of what I'm about to do. This is it, I finally get my explanation. But I freeze, I just sit there, afraid of facing it. So I decide to let her make the first move. I didn't feel aggression, no anger I was just confused and concerned in the moment. Trying to process it all.

This is it now, this is where the clip that I have replayed I my mind every hour of every day since had been born. I sit here alone in my car, waiting outside our family home, a place known for so much joy so many milestones and I stare at the back of this random car, a car owned by a stranger, a Stanger that my wife has chosen over me. There's an argument to throw in here that she's made this choice, over the house, over us as a family, tarnishing the memories and throwing away every future b'day, Christmas and event as a family, accepting months of separation fights and trauma, our path forever altered over, for this! But, honestly fuck all that in this moment, this was all about me. She chose him over me!! Every beautiful word spoken to one another, a million I love you's deleted in this very moment. Heartbroken.

  
I'm still waiting for her to get out of the car, signal the start of this terrifying conversation ahead. It's the last thing anybody wants, but I deserve it. I see through the back window that they're talking, 1 quick glance back at me, no eye contact though and the car starts rolling forward. She's asked him to put it in drive and leave. I had to watch my wife be driven away with another man, in an attempt to simply avoid me. I matter so little to her, the visual image of those two, avoiding eye contact as drive away from myself and our house her own life. Depending on perspective, its actually a beautiful representation of wants she's done, her emotional desires express through a real life action. This is the clip I play by the hour.

 As a sit to wonder, what? who? why? shit! fuck! cunt! This is where 'The thousand mile, blank stare' came from I just sit there. You ever had a moment when your mind was so blank, no thoughts, just empty? Imagine the worst possible version of peace that's where I was at, not quite though right in the center of your brain, you still see it all, you hear it you just can't quite make it out. Almost like sitting in your quiet house, with a tv on in the other room behind a door closed being able to hear but not make out the odd word. 

  
I think I'm longing this out to much. apologies to the readers.

Basically I just sit there. Eventually drive to her work. These two inconsiderate fuckers are sitting inside having coffee together as if there isn't a possibility of me coming by. I have to ask him to leave so I can talk to my wife!! I know I cant make matters worse right now, I just ask instantly as I walk in the door then I looked away. All within the same second, I had to realize he even in here, get my first look at him, ask something of him and look away without a reaction, the smallest reaction by anyone at this point would have ended in cuffs. 

Luckily though, there was no pushback, I was so afraid of my actions and so willing to see them through. I knew I just needed to focus on the talk with my wife. This is when she says, to justify these 2 days 'I texted you, told you I was fine'... as if I was in the wrong!!! Then proceeds to tell me its been a couple of weeks since they started! What do you say or do in the moment? The entire week of Christmas I wanted to bring my family back, was an inside joke within her inner circle. Every nice word, every feeling of progression nothing more than an avoidance tactic. I felt like and absolute fool.... I haven't been the same since these 2 days. A hermit, a loner. Cried more in the next week than the last 34years without so much as remorse for a single action. I wish I could tell you this is the worst of it, but it's far from it, She destroys my world for the next little while as she promotes this new guy like an obsession.

 But we will get into all that.... Part2

1qjay3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1qjay3t/how_to_make_small_talk_fun_the_psychology_behind/,How to Make Small Talk Fun: The Psychology Behind Becoming Unforgettable in Conversations,"Most of us treat small talk like a tax we pay for being in public. We mumble through the ""how's the weather"" script, pray nobody asks about our weekend, and count down the seconds until we can escape. I used to think I just sucked at this. Turns out, the way we're taught small talk is fundamentally broken.

After diving deep into communication research, social psychology books, and interviewing people who genuinely enjoy these interactions, I realized something wild. Small talk isn't inherently boring. We've just been doing it wrong our entire lives. The framework most of us follow is designed to extract information, not create connection. And our brains can smell that inauthenticity from a mile away.

The good news? There's actual science behind why some conversations spark and others flatly die. And once you understand the mechanics, you can turn any mundane exchange into something memorable.

**1. Stop asking interview questions, start making observations**

This one changed everything for me. Traditional small talk is just rapid fire questions. ""What do you do?"" ""Where are you from?"" ""How do you know the host?"" It feels like filling out a form.

Instead, lead with observations or playful statements. At a coffee shop, instead of ""Do you come here often?"" try ""The barista just gave me a look that suggested my order personally offended her ancestors."" It's specific, it's funny, and it gives the other person something to actually respond to.

Psychologist Ty Tashiro in his book [*Awkward: The Science of Why We're Socially Awkward and Why That's Awesome*](https://www.amazon.com/Awkward-Science-Socially-Thats-Awesome/dp/0062429159) (guy's a social interaction researcher at University of Maryland, the book literally won awards for making neuroscience accessible) explains that our brains are wired to respond to novelty and emotion, not data collection. When you make an observation, you're inviting someone into your perspective rather than interrogating them. 

This creates what he calls ""collaborative conversation"" where both people are building something together instead of trading resumes.

**2. Embrace strategic vulnerability**

Here's what nobody tells you. Safe, surface level chat keeps things safe and surface level. If you want the conversation to go somewhere interesting, you have to be willing to share something slightly personal first.

Not trauma dumping. Not oversharing about your IBS. But genuine, human stuff. ""I'm terrible with names and I've already forgotten yours twice"" is infinitely more endearing than pretending you remember.

Research from Dr. Arthur Aron (the guy famous for his 36 questions that make strangers fall in love) found that mutual vulnerability accelerates intimacy faster than any other factor. When you admit something real, even small, it gives the other person permission to drop their own mask.

I started testing this at networking events. Instead of ""What do you do?"" I'd say ""These events stress me out, I always end up hiding by the snack table."" The relief on people's faces was instant. Suddenly we're two humans commiserating instead of two professionals posturing.

**3. Follow the energy, not the script**

Most small talk dies because we're trying to follow some invisible rulebook instead of reading the actual person in front of us. If someone lights up talking about their weird hobby, don't pivot back to work stuff because that's ""appropriate."" Ride that wave.

Improv comedians use this principle called ""yes, and"" where you accept what your scene partner gives you and build on it. The podcast [*The Art of Charm*](https://open.spotify.com/show/08XveTtMJIYffPwjjVwpSM) (hosted by Jordan Harbinger, who's interviewed everyone from Kobe Bryant to intelligence operatives about human behavior) breaks down how this works in real conversations. 

When someone says something, instead of changing topics or one upping them, you acknowledge it and add something that moves it forward. They mention they just got back from hiking? ""Yes, and I bet your legs are still mad at you. Where'd you go?"" 

This keeps conversational momentum alive instead of constantly restarting from zero.

**4. Ask about feelings, not just facts**

Boring question: ""How was your vacation?""
Interesting question: ""What was the moment on your vacation where you felt most like yourself?""

See the difference? One gets you ""It was good, we went to the beach."" The other actually makes someone pause and think.

The book *We Need To Talk: How To Have Conversations That Matter* by Celeste Headlee (she's an NPR host who's spent her entire career interviewing people, this is her masterclass in communication) emphasizes that facts are forgettable but feelings stick. When you ask someone how they felt, what surprised them, what they're excited or nervous about, you're accessing the parts of their experience that actually matter.

I use this constantly now. Instead of ""How's the new job?"" I ask ""What's been the weirdest adjustment?"" People always have better answers.

**5. Be genuinely curious about random shit**

This sounds obvious but most of us fake curiosity. We ask questions we don't care about because we think we're supposed to. The other person can tell.

Here's the fix. Find something, anything, you're genuinely interested in about this person or situation and chase that thread. Maybe it's their unusual name, their vintage jacket, the fact that they said something slightly contradictory.

Susan Cain, who wrote *Quiet: The Power of Introverts* (spent seven years researching why certain people excel at deep conversation) notes that introverts often make exceptional conversationalists because they're genuinely curious about people's inner worlds. You don't need to be naturally outgoing. You just need to be authentically interested.

When I meet someone, I play a game where I try to discover one surprising thing about them within five minutes. It shifts my mindset from ""get through this"" to ""figure out what makes this person weird."" Way more fun.

**6. Use conversation starter apps for backup**

If your brain goes blank in social situations, having some tools helps. The app Shuffle has interesting conversation prompts, nothing cringe like ""if you were a tree,"" more like ""what's a skill you wish you'd learned as a kid?""

Another option worth checking out is [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google. You can actually create a personalized learning plan around becoming better at conversation as an introvert or mastering small talk in professional settings. It pulls from communication psychology books like the ones mentioned above, expert interviews, and research papers to generate custom audio lessons. 

The depth is adjustable too, so you can do a quick 10-minute refresher before an event or a 40-minute deep dive into conversation frameworks when you have time. The voice options make it less dry than reading, there's even a sarcastic narrator style that makes learning communication theory surprisingly entertaining. Worth exploring if you want structured guidance that adapts to your specific social struggles.

**7. End conversations intentionally**

Most awkward small talk moments happen because neither person knows how to exit. We just stand there slowly dying inside until someone's phone rings.

Learn to close conversations cleanly. ""This was great, I'm gonna grab another drink but let's continue this later"" or ""I should let you go, but seriously, good luck with the thing you mentioned."" 

Being the person who can gracefully end a chat makes you more memorable than being the person who traps people in conversation purgatory.

The actual secret to making small talk fun is realizing it's not about following rules. It's about treating these micro interactions as opportunities to connect with another weird human who's also just trying to get through the day. When you shift from performing to connecting, everything gets easier.

And honestly, most people are desperate for someone to make conversation less robotic. You doing that makes their day better too.",1,1769031093.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False
1qjay1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/WIBTA_AITA/comments/1qjay1x/aith_for_telling_my_wife_im_done_fasting_with_her/,AITH for telling my wife I’m done “fasting with her” after she started policing what I eat in my own house?,"



I’m 33M, my wife is 31F, married 4 years. I’m not religious. I grew up vaguely Christian, like church on holidays, but as an adult I’m pretty neutral. My wife has always been more spiritual than me, but it was never a problem until this year. She made a close friend at work (not drama with coworkers, just context) who invited her to a local Muslim community center, and over months my wife got really into it. I was honestly supportive at first. She seemed calmer, more grounded, made friends, stopped doomscrolling. A couple months ago she told me she’d converted. I said okay, I love you, tell me what you need from me. She asked if I’d fast with her for Ramadan “to show unity.” I said I’m not converting, but I can be respectful and I can make it easier for you. So we agreed on some basics: I wouldn’t cook bacon in the house, I’d keep alcohol out, I’d try not to eat in front of her during the day, and I’d do dinner with her after sunset. That felt fair.  



The problem is it didn’t stay at “respectful.” It turned into rules. If I made coffee in the morning she’d get upset because I was “tempting her.” If I ate a granola bar in the kitchen she’d act like I kicked a puppy. Then she started hiding snacks. I thought it was a joke at first because who does that, but it wasn’t. Last week I opened the pantry and my protein bars were just gone. She said she threw them out because they weren’t halal and she didn’t want “impure food” in the house during Ramadan. I told her that’s not okay, those are my groceries, and also I’m not fasting. She said I promised to fast with her and I’m breaking my word. I reminded her the agreement was I’d be considerate, not that I’d follow every rule like I’m her student. She got emotional and said I’m not taking her faith seriously.

I’m 33M, my wife is 31F, married 4 years. I’m not religious. I grew up vaguely Christian, like church on holidays, but as an adult I’m pretty neutral. My wife has always been more spiritual than me, but it was never a problem until this year. She made a close friend at work (not drama with coworkers, just context) who invited her to a local Muslim community center, and over months my wife got really into it. I was honestly supportive at first. She seemed calmer, more grounded, made friends, stopped doomscrolling. A couple months ago she told me she’d converted. I said okay, I love you, tell me what you need from me. She asked if I’d fast with her for Ramadan “to show unity.” I said I’m not converting, but I can be respectful and I can make it easier for you. So we agreed on some basics: I wouldn’t cook bacon in the house, I’d keep alcohol out, I’d try not to eat in front of her during the day, and I’d do dinner with her after sunset. That felt fair.  



The problem is it didn’t stay at “respectful.” It turned into rules. If I made coffee in the morning she’d get upset because I was “tempting her.” If I ate a granola bar in the kitchen she’d act like I kicked a puppy. Then she started hiding snacks. I thought it was a joke at first because who does that, but it wasn’t. Last week I opened the pantry and my protein bars were just gone. She said she threw them out because they weren’t halal and she didn’t want “impure food” in the house during Ramadan. I told her that’s not okay, those are my groceries, and also I’m not fasting. She said I promised to fast with her and I’m breaking my word. I reminded her the agreement was I’d be considerate, not that I’d follow every rule like I’m her student. She got emotional and said I’m not taking her faith seriously. I tried to compromise again: I’ll still do the sunset dinner, I’ll still avoid eating in the same room, but I’m not going to skip meals and have my stuff trashed. She said if I can’t fast for one month then I’m selfish and “addicted to comfort.” That stung because I’ve supported her through plenty of hard things, and I’m not some man child who can’t handle hunger, I just don’t want religion turned into a control lever.

I (24M) already working, have a gf (21F) who is still studying. This isnt much of my story.

My girlfriend of 2 years is really attractive and class7mates/schoolmates or people having a crush on her isn't a new thing and I dont have any problems with that because I trust my partner amd our commitment to each other. She is really an independent type of person not wanting to owe anyone anything. 

One day after her classes, one of her classmates ambushed her for a coffee date. One classmate offered to buy their friend group coffees for free, but my gf had to excuse herself to fetch something she forgot. Thinking her friends left already, she proceeded to head back home. Only to be surpruse the guy who offered coffee did not leave and followed her. He then ask her again to get coffee his treat. She said yes thinking nothing of it and the cafe is on the way to. They then converse, he was talking pictures of her and ofc my gf asked her to stop. After getting a sense of whats happening my gf asked to pay for her own drink when they were at the counter. The guy initially refused so he paid, but then told her she can pay once they are seated, and waiting for the drinks. She paid and sat, as it was about to rain my gf brough out her umbrella, and so did the guy placing it at the table and taking pictures. He then confessed to her and asked if she had a boyfriend, my gf answered yes but then he stated that she doesnt look like someone who is in a relationship, my gf played it off as a joke and he told her the ""youre not like other girls"", basically he commented that she doesnt look like someone who has a bf because she is simple unlike others who wears make-up and particular on how they look (my gf hated that and was kinda offended), (bf note: she wears make-up and is particular on her clothing, and that is okay, more than okay, thats how she empowers herself and she is beautiful in her choices). He berates her asking if the relationship is LDR, then if it is it wont work because he was in an LDR himself for LESS THAN A MONTH and he just like someone who is always near him. He added that she should break up with me instead emphasizing that LDRs are doomed to fail (okay guy who can't keep a relationship and commitment). She then disagreed with him and rejected him and his ideas. She got her coffee and left. 

Not even an hour he messaged her, to ""take care"".

That night he posted a picture of the coffee and the umbrellas, like someone who is soft-launching their gf.

Mind you, my gf just told me this that this guy used to tell their classmates and her PERSONALLY that he dont like her, a year or two before. He called her loud and sensutive when she was on a friends trip at a KTV and was getting over her past relationship that time. The guy invited himself, hogged the karaoke and refused to pay his share because he just tagged along, and didnt drink.

Just today, while at class my gf asked her friend to borrow a pencil and just when she is about to sit he was greeted by the guy sitting next to her. He asked to switch seats with his classmate. I'm afraid this harrasment will continue as guys like him just cant help themselves to insist themselves (unless you are already with them see how fast they run).

My gf told her off already and I told her given any more chances, I hope not I will talk to the guy for her. I understand her reluctance as she doesnt want to escalate things.

WIBTAH if I message him telling him to back off?

Some guys cant take a hint or even a no. ",0,1769030930.0,AITAH,1,0.33,False

I need another perspective...","So I ""asked out a girl"" from my college class last Friday morning. She said she was gonna go shoe shopping, so I said, ""Maybe we can go shopping together and study,"" (not as a literal suggestion), which she received positively as she took my number. *Apparently, during the first date, she told me that because I said ""and study,"" she wasn't sure if this was platonic or not.*

Anyway, she took a long time (+12hrs) to shoot me a text, but she finally did, and we agreed to hang out on Monday (MLK day) afternoon. She was really positive and said that she was ""looking forward to it!""

So I pick her up, and she's all dressed up nice and pretty, and with no backpack (so obviously she knew we weren't studying). Then the conversation from the beginning was never awkward, we just continued our convo from Friday's class, and also branched out to our life stuff, you know, and getting to know each other.

We went to a coffee shop/book store and had a great time talking about random stuff and about books, then after that i specifically asked her if she wanted to go shoe shopping. Then she said, ""no we can do anything, we can just talk or walk around."" She could've stopped there, but no, so obviously I think it was a good sign.

So I took her to a light show/mall, and we walked around for a couple of hours. And we held hands, and we were walking very close to each other, bumping shoulders and all that business. I even put my arm around her shoulder while walking in candy-shop and I don’t think she minded at all cause she wanted to keep walking around for quite a long time after that.

Then, I asked her why she took forever to text me first (at this point we were pretty comfortable), and she said ""well i had things to do, but I also had to make you wait a little bit."" And stuff like that, and we talked about pretty serious stuff as well.

Anyway, that night we text normal follow-up, and she says ""haha thanks again for everything,"" and I sorta ""apologized"" for not specifying it's a date, which she replied ""it’s totally fine, I had a really good time :))"".

Then my last message was ""I'll see you in class."" (We have class MWF). **But no response.**

But this morning, 1) she arrived late to class, and because of that, she had to come through the back door and sit at the very back, instead of the usual seat at the front / next to me. 2) I don’t know what her schedules like on Wed., but she left through the back door right away again without acknowledging me (maybe i'm too dramatic).

**So am I cooked? What could've gone wrong? Or should I follow up? Am I overreacting?** Any girl's perspective is also welcome. Thank you so much, everyone!",1,1769030811.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

The couch is bulky (it is temporary, but what we have for now) and can’t move far because of the doorway, etc. When the couch was pushed against the wall with the cut-out, the dogs tried to jump through.

1qjaq9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1qjaq9f/aita_college_edition/,AITA? College edition,"Hey guys i have a huuuge problem and I don’t know what to do honestly. This is also my first Reddit post asking for genuine advice. 

Basically I am 20, female and a student that lives in a dorm with 4 colleagues all of them women. I tried to get along with them since I am a friendly person but problems started to arise from the beginning with 2 of them, we will call them V and C. 

It all started somewhere in November when I wanted to have a serious conversation with them based on the fact that they make a lot of noise at 5-6 AM in the morning when everyone is sleeping. They would wake up at these crazy hours and start eating and brewing coffee and talking and doing their make up and all the shit at fucking 6 AM.

( I think it is importat to mention that our rooms don’t have a bathroom or a kitchen and there is a community kitchen on our floor where everyone eats because the rooms are too small for other activities besides sleeping.) 

They refuse to go to the kitchen to do these stuff because they think they are basically “too good” to go there and eat with the rest. I tried to explain to them that it is insane and very disrespectful to be this noisy at that hour, obviously I didn’t solve anything because their excuse was that they can’t carry the coffee machine in the kitchen to brew coffee…and they still refuse to go eat there even tho the smell and noise are horrendous. 

So yeah, this was the first problem, now the real deal that actually is pissing me offfff right now is that one of them,C, is complaining that i vape in the room, even tho her bed isn’t close to mine we are separated by a fridge. I don’t know what to do at this point because I feel like i can’t sleep, watch shit and now NOT EVEN VAPEEEE. And also I want to add that they never open the window and it smells like sweat and food so THE VAPE SMELLS BETTER THAN ANYTHING IN THIS ROOOOOOM. I think I am going crazy and I want advice, am I the asshole for asking them to stop eating in here? What should I do because they do not respect my wishes but I am apparently forced to respect their wishes, they are also very stubborn and talking doesn’t work, I accept any advice yall have I can’t take this…",2,1769030612.0,AmItheAsshole,25,0.58,False

1qjap7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSeattle/comments/1qjap7o/moving_to_seattle_but_need_suggestions/,Moving to Seattle but need suggestions,"Hello everyone!

I'm needing to move in the next two weeks and I've picked either Portland or Seattle. I already know about the pros and cons of the general two areas, so I don't need a ton of negative feedback but I wanted to instead hopefully get some insight on some areas that are nice to live around. Seattle is a lot bigger than Portland so it's been kind of hard to determine for myself that this or that area is nice and a lot of the posts i've read on here and elsewhere are more than 2 years old; most are also politically fueled comments that really don't do a lot.

So if someone could give suggestions on Areas, specific apartment buildings or even property management companies I would be forever thankful!

Here's some info about me - Single 30y/o Male with 1 dog. Being able to walk around my block or down a few to get some coffee, food or even see a show would be great but just in proximity would be awesome too. We're big hikers, like the downtown scene, but don't want to be heavily in it. Budget is flexible, I won't name a price but nothing outrageously crazy would be a huge plus. I know Rent is higher than what people expect so no worries. Also in the Medical field and plan to go to school full time. Big flyer, I frequent airports quite a bit so an international airport would be super nice too.

I know my likes are rather specific but I'm flexible, I just want to live in a safe place where I can walk my dog and not feel like i'd step on a needle or get mugged.

Of note, the only street view area i've looked at is Capitol Hill area and I love the area so much from what I've seen.

Thank you again! I look forward to hopefully getting some guidance.



UPDATE - 

Thank you all for the great answers! I now have an idea of what to look towards. I truly appreciate the helpful/respectful responses. ",0,1769030546.0,AskSeattle,53,0.27,False

1qjamas,https://www.reddit.com/r/deardiary/comments/1qjamas/20260121_meeting_for_coffee/,2026/01/21 meeting for coffee,"today i woke up just before 8:00 thinking it was much earlier.  i'm waking less and less overnight.  it was getting a bit ridiculous to fall asleep around 10:00 and wake up at midnight to use the bathroom.  i had a permutation of my old [bowel bowl](https://imgur.com/qd14Kyd) adapted to the current situation and availability of ingredients (blueberries are a natural laxative).  even though i was going for coffee, i still also had a coffee.  

at the caffe, i had a mocha and a samosa and they were both excellent.  i didn't play up reaching for my wallet, but i did at least make the pretense of 'i can get this'.  over coffee, i didn't talk at length about the issues troubling me but i did at least make them known and my friend was sympathetic as of course i knew they would be.  i've kept them at arm's length for months and at this first meeting, i think both of us were sussing out exactly what to say and give away and how much.  they're busy with work but we've tentatively scheduled a dinner some time in march.  i've been invited to meet their family and i've wanted to for a while now.  stepping outside the caffe, in the snow, i found a [cigar](https://imgur.com/Ls5YVS5) which i'm sure is incredibly fine.  i plan to smoke it when i pass my licensing exam.    

i wasn't long at home before receiving another and potentially more lucrative phone call.  it was with a lady i met in the hospital who i find genuinely interesting as a person but who also has connections for me to work as a PSW or potentially as a nurse.  i'm not sure if she's over 65, she might be she might not be, but in our conversations she's made it known she has friends who may be in need of my services.  this would be perfect for me when i'm ready to return to work.  join up with an agency and work for these individuals at their homes according to their schedule.  it could be considered a business lunch tomorrow with this lady even though i may not be entirely ready just at this moment for a full return to work.  i know, in entering this roll, i would be 'the help' but i've swallowed my pride enough times that it's polished by now and goes down pretty easy as long as i get paid.  there's nothing to lose with at least meeting for coffee and i'm excited just to see her tomorrow as a social visit but an ulterior motive is not entirely unwelcome.

i know i'm not ready for real work.  i'm tired just from the past few days, which haven't been anywhere near the demands of full-time anything.  it's good, though, to be tired.  it's good to push, to rest and do it all over.  *i was* [tired](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/hello-i-retired-words-nametag-sticker-older-person-blue-to-illustrate-you-done-your-career-31478512.jpg) *yesterday and i'll be tired again tomorrow* but it's a good thing.  even being re-tired is something.

lunch was the usual these days, a homemade flatbread with some [roasted vegetables](https://imgur.com/7qNFtAL) (they were seasoned with zaatar) and spicy pickled vegetables as well as a carrot bread [muffin](https://imgur.com/uo8ODuo).  an [iced coffee](https://imgur.com/1MhopL2) because i'm tired.  dinner will be the same as yesterday.

My husband and I are both working on a healthy lifestyle together, and obviously that includes losing weight. I'm a stay at home mom, he works from home. All of our meals are together, and I cook over 90% of them with over 90% of said meals being from scratch (for instance, I make our own whole grain bread but buy conventional tortillas for the occasional Tex-Mex night). Since I am the one cooking, I use my kitchen scale to keep track of our calories.

Because I am breastfeeding, our TDEEs are almost identical and our deficits likewise. So despite literally eating most of the same meals, it's been a very interesting education where we differ in terms of calorie consumption.

First, breakfast. Cuban coffee for both of us (my husband is Cuban). He makes a traditional cafecito (essentially black coffee with sugar mixed in) and we split it between the two of us. However, I make mine into a cafe con leche from there by adding milk. Otherwise, our breakfast is exactly the same, even serving sizes. However, I come out with higher breakfast calories.

Second, lunch. I always make grilled chicken for lunch. There are salad options, pasta options, and rice options to go with it. I choose salad with a homemade very low calorie balsamic dressing (basically balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and a touch of mustard). My husband may just toss his chicken in some homemade honey mustard if he's particularly busy with work or have a salad with Caesar dressing. Some days one of us may need/want more chicken than another day (4oz, 6oz, sometimes 8oz+).

Third, dinner. Our portion sizes can vary with dinner. This is where some of our differences can come in, and it is why I'll touch on the next part.

Fourth, snacks. I am not a snacker. I've never really been a snacker, I prefer a large dinner over everything else. I like what I cook, and I will always want more of it. My husband has always been a snacker. He loves his brie cheese or a small chocolate or his popcorn/kettlecorn. I like an orange or quick Supergreens mixed in a glass of water and I'm good to go, he might want a banana or a coconut bite or something else.

Both of us have joked that it \*feels like\* he eats more than I do because he has multiple snacks a day. But he weighs and logs all his snacks, and lets that determine some of his other meals particularly dinner. He may start with a smaller portion of dinner to see if he wants more later or save room for a late night snack. I on the other hand do not do this, I will only have a late night snack if I need to make up to my minimum.

And it has worked out! We're averaging the same deficit and it is showing in our average weekly weight loss. So yes, while my husband snacks much more than I do and we eat the same meals, we are losing weight at the same rate because we have nearly the same TDEE and are in the same deficit (the same deficit being the important part here). We both cut out liquid sugar (sweet tea primarily), so that's not even a difference we have to factor in.",6,1769030276.0,loseit,4,0.71,False

1qjakda,https://www.reddit.com/r/debtfreeliving/comments/1qjakda/best_personal_loans_for_couples/,Best personal loans for couples,"My wife and I just got back from a great trip to Hawaii. Then real life showed up. Credit card balances went up higher than we thought. We’ve always paid at least minimums on time, but utilization did its thing and my score has dropped into the mid-650s. Hers a bit higher in the 680 range on average.

We are looking to consolidate around **$28,000** across a few cards between the two of us. We’re both self-employed with a steady income and can put around $1,000 - $1,500 per month towards the debt depending on how business went. We sat down over the weekend and split up the work into researching.

• Online lenders only (local credit unions didn’t like the self employment)  
 • Soft pulls only  
 • No documents or hard pulls  
 • **48-month term** across the board (longer than we really want, but keeping payments lower took priority)

Here’s how it shook out.

**SoFi**

SoFi was the smoothest experience from a pure UX standpoint. Fast, clean, and polished. It asked for individual income, made it clear verification would come later, and showcased the co-borrower option early.

My solo soft-pull offer landed around **12.7% APR for 48 months**.

We tested it jointly. Adding my wife didn’t change the rate substantially. It felt like SoFi mostly prices off the primary borrower, with the co-applicant acting more as support than leverage. Nothing wrong with it, just a bit rigid if you’re trying to optimize as a couple.

**Achieve**

Achieve was where the process actually adapted to us.

Right in the flow, they clearly pushed their **“add co-applicant income”** and explained why it mattered. It wasn’t buried. It was framed as a real lever.

My solo soft-pull offer came back around **11.9% APR for 48 months**, with the origination fee baked into the APR.

When my wife ran her soft pull and we added her as a co-borrower, the numbers actually moved. The joint offer dropped into the **low-9% APR range at 48 months**, and the fee stayed reasonable.

This was the only lender where applying together clearly changed the economics instead of just checking a box. They also framed the loan around direct payoff to creditors, which lined up exactly with what we were trying to do.

**Discover**

Discover felt very bank boring, in a good way. Calm, predictable, with no gimmicks.

The solo offer was competitive, around **11% APR at 48 months**, with **no origination fee**.

The limitation was structural. Discover doesn’t do co-borrowers. For a married couple trying to optimize together, that mattered. Nothing wrong with the lender, it just didn’t fit our situation once we compared it side by side.

**Best Egg**

Best Egg was quick to give results, but the easiest to move past.

The soft-pull offer came back around **13.8% APR at 48 months**, with a noticeable fee baked in. Co-borrowers are allowed, but it didn’t meaningfully improve the deal.

It leaned heavily on monthly payment framing, and it was harder to feel confident about total cost without going deeper.

Summary - who actually deserved our time

**Best overall personal loan for a couple: Achieve**  
The only lender where adding my wife as a co-borrower clearly improved the offer in a way that mattered.

**Best pure digital experience: SoFi**  
Fast, polished, and clean, but less flexible for joint optimization.

**Most straightforward solo option: Discover**  
Solid and predictable, but limited by single-borrower rules.

**Easiest to cross off once compared: Best Egg**  
Fine on its own, less compelling next to the others.

This was all done in one Sunday night with lots of coffee. No documents uploaded. No hard pulls. These weren’t final locked rates, but real soft-pull APRs tied to a **48-month term**.

This was just our experience. Curious if other couples saw the same thing, especially with a focus on the co-borrower aspect.",3,1769030249.0,debtfreeliving,4,1.0,False

My sister and I recently bought a Sage Oracle Jet coffee machine and we’ve had it for a couple of weeks now. We’re really struggling with consistency and honestly running out of things to try.

We’re using fresh medium-roast beans and the same grinder settings. We thought we’d dialled the coffee in, but because the shot timings are so inconsistent, it’s really hard to tell.



Our process is always the same:

1. Run a blank shot
2. Grind + auto tamp
3. Pull the shot



Because the auto tamp doesn’t always feel great or consistent, we also have a manual tamper that we use sometimes just to make sure everything is properly tamped.

The problem is the shot times are wildly inconsistent.



For example:

* First shot after a blank shot might run around 28 seconds
* Second shot straight after, same beans and same steps, can run around 18 seconds
* Other times the second shot runs slower instead. There’s no obvious pattern.

This happens with back-to-back coffees. Nothing changes between shots.



We also swapped the basket:

* the basket that came with the machine is around 22g, which felt too big
* Now using an IMS 18g basket
* Still using the original Sage portafilter



We wouldn’t expect that alone to cause this level of variation, but mentioning it just in case.



Other things we’ve noticed:

* Auto tamping doesn’t always feel right
* Second coffee is especially unpredictable



At this point we’re pretty frustrated and seriously thinking about returning it and moving to a dual boiler with a separate grinder instead.



Has anyone had similar issues with the Oracle Jet or have any ideas on what we should try next?

Any advice appreciated.

That’s the machine I’ve been using lately, and it’s the first one that really clicked for me. Having the grinder built in makes a bigger difference than I expected. Grinding fresh beans right before pulling a shot noticeably improved flavor compared to what I was getting before.

It did take a bit of time to get used to dialing in grind size and learning the steam wand, but once I figured out a routine, it became easy to use day to day. Espresso has been consistent, and milk drinks actually come out the way I want them to.

It’s not a one-button machine, but that’s kind of the point. It gives enough control to improve your coffee without feeling overwhelming. For anyone who wants better espresso at home and is willing to learn a little, this one has been a solid experience so far.

I posted a while back that my therapist said I was very lightly depressed when I told her I thought I was stable but uncomfortable.

I decided to pull my head in and not let it get worse. So I started cleaning my room daily, working out on the treadmill, leaving the house everyday not just for work, started cooking for the first time a little, listened to an audiobook, did other daily cleaning tasks, worked on self care like skin care, teeth brushing, med taking, showering!!! I was doing all the right things. I felt under control and finally like maybe I was free from bipolar. I was sleeping pretty decently and still had periods of sleepiness during the day so I knew it wasn’t hypomania!

I even went back on dating apps and met a guy and went on a date. Things felt fixed and I was in control and finally bloody happy. My thoughts weren’t really racing, I wasn’t overspending much, sleep like I said was manageable, I had energy but it wasn’t like out the gate energy, I was motivated and confident, all my self esteem issues were gone and the voices I hear when I’m not doing well had gone too. I felt pretty again and worth love and affection.

Granted a lot of it was out of character behaviour but it wasn’t unhealthy behaviour and I was fixing my life!!! I just decided I needed to change myself from the inside out and it was working, until it wasn’t. 

My therapist said this sounds like hypomania peeking through and she was concerned for me. Idk why because I was fucking thriving!!!! I felt like my true self and this just incredible person.

It’s made me question everything like will I ever actually be okay or what’s the point in trying if it’s going to be labeled an episode when it wasn’t. I swear I wasn’t hypomanic at all I just fixed my life. 

I’ve woken up this morning so depressed and feeling like my skins crawling. Everything is bleak and awful again. I don’t see the point in trying anymore I just don’t have the energy. I’m overcome with anxiety and worry with a heavy shower of pure depression raining on me. The critical voices are back and I feel like I’m being watched and judged (I know they aren’t real so I don’t need to be concerned) but I feel them constantly berating me for not doing things or for doing things wrong to the point I start changing my behaviour to stop them from being so loud. I will make a coffee a certain way because if I don’t I’ll be laughed at or made to feel worse about myself so I have to do it the “right way”. 

This feeling is unbearable I want my happy free self back but I can’t get out of bed to do the work. I’m so stressed with life stressors like my terminally ill dad who’s got a surgery tomorrow morning and some other stupid fucking shit going on that’s causing me to just feel so small and stuck.

I am so tired. I don’t feel hopeless, because deep down I know something has to work, but what that something is? I honestly don't know anymore.

I was reflecting the other day on this PCOS journey and realized I’ve been dieting on and off for fifteen years. I could not believe it when the math finally hit me. I was diagnosed in grade 7, but high school was when the weight really started to control my life. I was 5’4” and in the 190s, and I can clearly remember that being the moment I officially started the process of wanting to lose weight—of wanting to disappear and be anyone else.

The hirsutism has always been the hardest part. I used to bleach the hair to try and hide it, but eventually, it got so bad I was shaving three times a day. I remember just sitting there thinking, this is it. I’m going to have to live like this forever. I never felt worthy of love. I truly didn't think anyone could ever love me with this condition. My doctors didn’t help; they just repeated the same script: ""Lose weight.""

So, I started to make myself okay with the misery. I told myself this was just my ""slot in life,"" my test, and that I had it better than others so I should just be grateful. But my self-esteem was at an all-time low. I was so anxious to be around people, terrified they would think I was disgusting or point at my facial hair—which many people felt obligated to do. It controlled me. It limited every single part of how I moved through the world.

Things didn’t look up until my second year of university. I felt sick, lethargic, and honestly, just disgusted by how I let people treat me because I didn't have the strength to stand up for myself. I ended up taking a break from school for two years. My first year I worked, but that second year? Something shifted.

I remember falling down a rabbit hole of raw vegan YouTube videos. It sounds small, but it blew my mind. Even though I knew fruit was sweet, I could not fathom that you could actually turn fruits and vegetables into desserts. The idea that you could make a cake out of them was crazy to me. I don’t know what it was about that discovery, but it ignited a change in me.

My parents were harping on me to go back to uni after that first year off; they just wouldn't let it go. So, I lived a lie. For a whole year, I pretended to commute to school. I’d leave the house with my bag packed, but in reality, I was going to the gym every single morning. Afterward, I’d head to a coffee shop and sit there for hours, just working on myself.

During that time, I found a book called How to Make Your Own Lunch. It isn't necessarily a book I would recommend to people, but it was a book I needed at that certain time in my life and it found me. I was struggling with myself and where my life was going after leaving uni, and I spent my days in that coffee shop going through it page by page—taking notes, reflecting, and actually doing the work on my soul.

There was a quote in there that said: Don’t dream it, be it. Don’t hope for it, work for it. It ignited something. I went to the gym five days a week, doing an hour of cardio—walking on an incline, then eventually running. I changed my diet, but not in a way that felt like a prison. I made sane choices. Eggs and toast instead of cereal. A small plate of rice instead of a mountain. No pop. No sugar in my coffee. I did that for two years and I dropped from 220 pounds down to 157. For the first time, I felt like I had won.

But fast forward 15 years, and I’m back at 200 pounds. It feels like anything I do simply will not work.

I tried the slow carb diet for a month. Nothing. I took all carbs out. Nothing. I took all fruit and carbs out and managed to hit 193, but I stayed there for two months without the scale moving an inch. Finally, about two weeks ago, I decided: screw it all. I’m done living in this ""restrictive era."" I have been doing it for far too long and I am just finished with it.

I was 193 two weeks ago. And then now I'm back up to 200. I've been doing weights three times a week and cardio twice a week. I'm taking inositol once in the morning and once in the evening, and I've introduced carbs back in—very healthy ones, like a slice of toast or a tiny bit of rice at lunch. I refuse to be scared of carbs anymore. They have taken such a toll on my life. I do not want to think about food every single second of every single day and I am so tired of this shit.

I’m scared, though. I see the scale going up and I try to tell myself it's water weight or muscle, but I'm terrified it isn't. I'm terrified that my body is just not functioning correctly. I wonder sometimes if I’ve wrecked my metabolism after fifteen years of constant dieting. My family tells me to ask for Ozempic, but I’ve lost the weight naturally before and I don't want to rely on those GLP-1s.

My period is still irregular and the hirsutism is still there, even though laser has been the one thing that actually helped over the last eight years. I’m not hopeless, I’m just tired. I have faith that something will click eventually, but I haven't found it yet. People tell me to see a naturopath, but how do you find the right one? It’s so overwhelming and I don’t want to waste money on someone who’s just going to tell me what my doctor says: lose weight, no carbs. I have done it. I swear to God I have done it with no cheating, exhausting every effort to no avail.

I want to end this by saying that outside of this struggle, I’m actually okay. I’m content with my life. I’m incredibly thankful for what I have—a great job, wonderful co-workers, a boss who supports me, and a family I love. I’m grateful for this whole journey, in a way, because it’s made me a resilient person. I will never give up. I will keep trying and doing different things, but I need to find something sustainable. I need to find the thing that works, even if it takes five years to see a downward trend, because I just can’t keep living in this cycle. I’m ready to finally find what works for me.

I’m a childless 31 F from the US, who just got back from a lovely visit in Anaheim with my husband. This’ll be a long write up, but I had the time of my life and have to share with others who will get it! There’s a place below to skip to when we arrive at the park, because I’m wordy with preamble.

I’ve been obsessed with Disneyland since I was a little one. While I have always loved both of the main Disney parks in the US, there was a lot of online photography posted for Disneyland when I was growing up as a teen. It had a reputation for being a better park for character interactions because it was smaller. Also, the fact that it was the first Disney park had always felt very special to me. This resulted in me collecting Disney vacation books, looking at maps and videos of the park constantly, and telling anyone who listened that my dream job was to be a face character for Disney someday.

I could never really afford to go until recently. Things fell into place for my husband and I to go, so we budgeted a 4 night stay in Anaheim, with 2 full days for Disney - one very busy day at Disneyland, and a more relaxed day at California Adventure. For both days, I got the multi pass add on option which allowed for 3 lightning lane selections. My husband kindly said ‘this vacation is for you, plan the days how you want’, so I got to scheduling. Which was fun and terrifying, because I’m not the planner in our relationship, I tend to go with the flow. With us only having two days, I knew that going with the flow was not an option 😂 There was too much that I wanted to do and being a Disneyland obsessed adult who has read trip reports for decades, I knew the realities. Long lines, rides breaking down, characters not scheduled when you think they will be out, etc etc.

Disneyland was scheduled on a Wednesday, during a slower week in January, which I looked into before booking tickets. I can’t do most thrill rides, I get motion sickness from roller coasters or too much spinning, and my husband gets vertigo from heights. So the multi-pass option for LL was all we needed, as we were doing mostly kiddie rides with shorter wait times, with a few notable exceptions (will mention those later).

We arrived a little before 11 am. I know, I know, I’m breaking all the rules. We didn’t rope drop /or/ have LL for every attraction, but I had been watching wait times for rides weeks leading up to our vacation and was very optimistic about how much we could get done by end of day.

So when we first arrived, no lines to get into the park and the weather was lovely! I set our first LL for Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway right away to have our time slot. As soon as we entered the area of Main Street, I see Cruella on a trolley with guests, and she’s cackling loudly, carrying on with theatrics. 😂 It was awesome. We immediately check out a ton of the Main Street shops to take mental notes of what we want to grab before leaving!

After browsing the shops + oohing and aahing over Main Street, we book it over to Pixie Hollow to meet Tinkerbell, a character I knew I wanted to meet if she was out. Line was totally fine, maybe 15-20 minutes? I loved her so much. She was such a sweetheart. I’m 5’2 and always the short one in photos, and I had a couple of inches on this girl, she was so little haha! She sprinkled me with pixie dust (glitter) and was just lovely - a highlight of my trip.  I just loved her.

We head to Toon Town while taking in some of the shops on the way. I freak out over how big the outside of Its a Small World Is. I guess it was hard for me to fathom in photos, because it shocked me (in a good way). I see the Genie walking around on the way. 🙂

When we got to Toon Town, we had 15-20 minutes to kill before our LL, which was fine, because I wanted photos of Mickey and Minnie’s houses. Right after we hit those, our first ride! Runaway Railway was incredible. I don’t know what I expected, but it was better than I thought it would be. Such a cool ride. I set the next LL for Astroblasters to save our time slot.

While exiting the ride, we see Pete walking away (I snap a great photo), but we also see that Pluto has just come out and a very small line gathered for photos! I get in it and 5 minutes later, we’re meeting Pluto! When I asked for his autograph, he stuck the book on his snout to sign. It tickled me sooo much.

We go and ride It’s a Small World. It’s all decked out for the holidays and was lovely, and the breeze/AC was super nice as well. Loved the shaped hedges at the end.

We head towards Main Street to prepare for the parade and to get some food.  Husband grabbed two churros and I tried a few bites (delicious), but was saving my appetite forrrr…. Little red wagon corn dogs. Man, they were so good, I loved them!

Took in a few more Main Street shops and then got a lovely curb spot to sit for the parade! It was so cute. They did the Celebrate Happy 70th anniversary song. We saw Max, Captain Hook, Pinocchio, Geppetto, Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Pluto, Goody, Chip + Dale, Miguel, Genie, Aladdin, Merida, Moana, Snow White, Belle, and Pocahontas. And of course the other beautiful dancers and performers. I had a lovely time. I’m a simple gal, I love a good parade, even if this was a short one. 🙂

We then go to check out Tomorrowland! We only had one ride planned for that area, so we took in the shops and sights, I took photos of Pizza Planet, and we did Buzz Light Years Astro Blasters for our second LL. I adore rides where you aim and shoot on tracks, so this was another great one.

After this, I did not set another LL because a lot of the rides I could have used it on had short wait times. I figured we’d find use for it later.

We then head to Fantasyland, because I wanted to ride a lot there. I’m relying on photos to report the order we did them in, so hopefully this is correct. 😝

We did Pinocchio first (5 min line), then Snow White right after (10-15 min line). I took photos of the bibbidy boppity boutique and got a bit emotional about being so close to the castle.

We get in line for Peter Pan’s Flight with an expected 25 min wait. We’re in the line for 2 minutes when people in front of us say they were informed the ride has shut down, so we exit. I’m only mildly disappointed, because I’m more relieved we were not in line that long before it happened.

We get in line for Dumbo, which is by far the worst line of the day for a few reasons. It said it would be a 15 min wait but was closer to 30-40, and the line was in direct heat and on hard concrete. It was fine, but it put a hurting on our aging bodies, and was the rough point of the day. Dumbo was fun and classic and the views were better than I thought they’d be! It gets higher up than it looks from the ground! I’m glad we toughed it out.

We get off Dumbo and I take some photos of the Teacups, because I love them but couldn’t ride them (the spinning in the slow cars still looked too rough for me). We take a sitting break then do Casey Jr train, which only had a 5 minute wait. I love all kid rides, so I still very much enjoyed it and believe it’s worth doing, but it was probably one of the rides lower on my list in terms of fun. Sounds harsher in text than how I mean it, I still enjoyed the ride. But the exhaustion was probably setting in a bit too, and I was ready for the sun to start going down even though we had a few hours before that would happen.

After exiting that one, I see Belle walking around with some children. I take some photos of her while she’s strolling. I see Aladdin taking photos with a small line (5 mins), so I get in it! Aladdin is so sweet and charming, signs my book, and takes some photos with me!

We do Storybook Canal (15 min wait) and Alice in Wonderland (30 min wait). I’m an Alice fanatic and had to do that one, plus the line wasn’t in the direct heat like Dumbo. Not so bad. Both rides were a blast and I’m a huge Tangled fan, so I liked seeing Rapunzel’s tower on the canal ride. That area also had a lot of Disney ducks, and one kept paddling in front of our boat near the end of the ride. It was adorable.

At this point, Peter Pan’s Flight was operational but at a 45 min line and no LL available, I knew it was probably getting sacrificed from our plans. A bummer, but you can’t get caught up on what you can’t control when you’re trying to make a dream day happen! ☺️

We check out the inside bridge part of the castle. I can’t believe I’m standing inside of something that I’ve stared at for so many years in photographs. I really soak that in. We take some photos in front of the castle then head to the Royal Hall for some unfortunate news.

They had stopped accepting new entries in line to see the princesses, which are some of my favorite characters, and I do experience some mild disappointment when we find out. It only lasts for a minute, because I know I can see Anna and Elsa  in DCA tomorrow, plus I saw princesses in the parade and Belle walking around. Any time I saw a character just hanging out in the wild felt very special to me. I’ve loved the face characters for a lot of years.

I at this point warn my husband that we need to go do Adventureland and then will have to walk all the way back to Small World for a show at 8 pm. We can do it, but I know it’s a lot of walking/backtracking, and we have to time it all right to make it happen. He’s game, so we head to do more rides and find beignets. The sun has set and everything (like walking) is much easier because it feels nice outside.

We get sidetracked when I see Bengal BBQ and remember all the praise I’ve seen it get on Reddit/elsewhere, so I say let’s get dinner here. We got skewers and rice, and it was super good. The beef was a little tough but the flavor was great, and the chicken was fantastic. Sticky rice was very tasty. And I know no one asked, but the fountain Powerade I drank with dinner might have saved my life, it tasted so good and refreshing haha.

I see jungle cruise has a 15 min wait line and even though I hadn’t put it on our priority list, I say ‘let’s do this’, because in my mind, it was kind of replacing the missed Peter Pan ride. The wait ended up being closer to 25 minutes if I had to guess, and the queue for that ride is…baffling. 😂 You feel like you’re going nowhere and won’t ever arrive. But the ride was weird, and fun, and I never saw people say do it at night, but do it at night!!! It’s so cool with the lights on and the pitch black moments.

We get in line for Pirates, wait is maybe 25 mins. Again, the sun has set, and we’re not sweating bullets anymore, so the wait isn’t horrible, though I’m getting concerned about time. I wanted to do the Pooh ride before hitting the Small World projection show, and my husband wanted to try beignets as a top priority food. Pirates is awesome. I knew I’d like it, but I liked it even more than I thought I would. I really enjoyed the water ride aspect of this one and the animatronics were very impressive!

We find the line for beignets and it’s huge, much longer than I was expecting. We get in the line and I realize something needs to get sacrificed probably. I am very nostalgic about Pooh and wanted to see that area/ride, so I say to my husband ‘let’s skip the small world projection show’, even though I really don’t want to miss it. He said let’s get our beignets and book it to the show, walk all the way back for the Pooh ride, and do shopping on Main Street before the castle projection show. I couldn’t believe he was willing to walk from Adventureland to Small World back to Pooh Corner, but I immediately agreed, because I wanted to fit it all in!

I realize we can do a Roger Rabbit LL right after the Small World projection show to make the walk feel a bit more “worth it”, so I book that while in line for the beignets. I hadn’t planned to do that ride, but it was the best use of our remaining passes, and I was really happy at this point in the night; we had gotten so much done that I’d wanted to do and I’d had a great day so far.

There is a 5 minute cash register swap for the beignets that makes us very tight on time, so we grab our beignets, coffees, and a mint julep, and power walked on very tired feet to get to the show. It was a grueling walk, but it was worth it. We arrived a few minutes before the projection show started and it made me cry to see it. I’m not sure what it is, but there’s something about the music and projection on the buildings that just really gets me. I couldn’t believe I was there and it made me tear up multiple times. I was so happy afterwards that we made it, because it was a beautiful sight to see. I also don’t want to forget to report on the snacks that we had on the way and during the show - the beignets and mint julep were divine. Truly heavenly.

We head back to Toon Town to do Roger Rabbit, which was a lot of fun. It was totally worth doing on the fly, I’m glad we added it to the day!

We then did the long walk back to the Pooh Ride, going through Adventureland. It’s such a cool area back there that I really didn’t mind, even though our feet were starting to kill us. The Pooh ride and the themed area with the gift shop made me clap like a little kid, it’s too adorable. I wish we had been able to meet the Pooh characters, but we were nowhere near that area while they were out that day.

We headed back to Main Street and picked up a bunch of souvenirs. I got a baby Minnie in a swaddle, an Ariel bubble wand, two tees, cotton candy, a tigger tail, and a little snowglobe. We found a spot for the final show which was at 9:30 and it was absolutely magical. I know I don’t need to go into crazy detail on the show since it’s widely available online, but gosh. It made me cry again and I loved seeing the fairy zip lining near the castle. What a dream.

We left the park around 10pm, which meant we’d been there a little over 11 hours. In that time, I did meet and greets with three characters, rode 13 rides with only 3 being through LL passes, and saw 2 projection shows in between shopping, taking photos, and eating delicious food.

I could honestly cry while thinking about it. I know that I got lucky with wait times and circumstances. I cannot afford to go back for a long while most likely, and it all played out so beautifully. A nearly ideal day.

The second day was a lot more chill, by design. I knew my agenda for Disneyland was nuts and I couldn’t do a second day of it 😂 Plus, there was a lot I couldn’t ride in California Adventure. We still had plans, though!!

There were no lines getting into DCA on Thursday.  We arrived at the park around 1:30 pm and I immediately set up a LL time slot for the Mike and Sully ride. The first thing we see when we really get in was Oswald, who I ran over to take some photos of! He gave me a nice big wave onto his next location!

We took in a couple of shops on Buena Vista street, then immediately went to Hollywood Land to meet Anna and Elsa. Since I’d missed the meet and greets with the princesses at Disneyland, it was important to me to do that first.

The lovely ladies from Frozen were the longest line of the trip, sitting at about 45 minutes or so, maybe a bit longer? The line had two major things going for it, though. It was inside and it was surrounded by screens playing Disney videos and music. This really did make a big difference, as the sun had tired us out the day before.

I really enjoyed my visit with Anna and Elsa. They were very sweet to me (especially the cast member playing Anna), and they made a lovely video for my sister back home when I asked them if they could. It was absolutely worth the long wait and I’d go see them again in a heart beat.

When we got out of the meet and greet, I saw that Judy was out for photos. My husband and I both love zootopia, but I wasn’t eager to stand in another 45+ minute line, so I said ‘let’s go see how long the wait is’. We walk the short distance to the back lot and there is literally no one in line. It was a shocking surprise, I was so thrilled to run right over and meet her with no wait! We got some great photos with her and some hugs.

We checked out a few shops in the area and decided to get a snack before our dinner slot. We got some food at Award Wieners, he had a Philly dog and I had some delicious french fries. We also traveled down a little to grab cheesecake orbs from Terran treats which were tasty but sooo rich haha. They were the small ones (infinity stone themed), so we ate half and gave the rest to a young couple who seemed thrilled to try them. 😁 I wouldn’t normally do that, but these had come in a box like little chocolates and several were completely untouched! I couldn’t bare to throw them away

After that it was time to head to the monster inc ride for our LL slot!

On the way, we saw Donald taking pictures and had to stop! The line was maybe 10 minutes long and we had such cute, memorable moments with him. My husband had a little shoulder stitch plushie and it honked Donald off when he saw him. He pretended like he was gonna rip Stitch off and throw him like a baseball 😭🤣

The monsters inc ride was the longest LL wait we had. I’d say it took maybe 10-15 minutes to get on the ride? But it was such a neat queuing area that I didn’t really care! Plus, we had a lot less to ride this day, and I knew that. We weren’t as pressed for time.

I loved the ride. I saw it will be closing for good soon and I’m so glad that I got to ride it before that happens. I adored the door room part from the movie, towards the end.

After the ride, I set a LL for Midway Mania to save our time slot. At this point in the day, I’m not sure the third pass will get used, as the other rides I have planned (Jessie’s carousel and little mermaid) have 5-10 min waits.

We had book a time at Goofy’s Kitchen and my husband wanted to get his Lego passport stamped at the Downtown Disney store on the way, so we started heading that way. On the way out of DCA, I saw Minnie taking photos in her pink Buena Vista street dress and wanted to stop! The line was 10-15 minutes and there was a Disney photographer who gave us qr codes to scan for photos afterwards. Minnie was such a delight! She hugged me extra long and was doing cute little jazz dance movements in between interactions. I loved her so much 🥹 This interaction felt particularly joyous, because the cast member playing Minnie was having a lot of fun with it.

The walk to Downtown Disney wasn’t bad. We stopped to take photos next to the huge “celebrate happy” instillation in between the two parks and I waved at Disneyland as we passed it (I already missed it on day 2, even with as much fun as I was having 🤣)

We checked out Downtown Disney (shops, LEGO store, etc) and walked the rest of the way to the Disneyland hotel for our 5:30 dinner slot.

This part of the day was so much fun. I have wanted to do a character dining since I was a tiny child and saw those “breakfast with Mickey and Minnie” promotional dvds that got sent out to US households lol. Yes, it was expensive. The buffet selection was somewhat small, considering the price. But I would do it/pay it again for a bunch of reasons.

1.) Despite a smaller selection, everything was fresh and made with quality ingredients. I especially enjoyed the steak and asparagus salmon, but there were ribs, pizzas, a delicious pot pie. Plenty to eat on and get full.

2.) Meeting so many characters without a line is a premium I would pay for again and again. If anything, I’m sad I didn’t do a princess character dining in addition to goofys kitchen, but I know if I ever come back.

We met Goofy and got photos before we were even seated, and then met Chip and Dale, Minnie, and Pluto while eating. The characters come up to your table for visits and it’s spaced out nicely, with minutes in between visits so that you’re meeting characters the whole time you’re eating. In addition, I got to watch the little children at tables next to me react to the characters, and it was very sweet and heartwarming. I really enjoyed myself.

When we had dessert, they offered us both complimentary coffee, which we gladly accepted. When you’re paying for a pricy meal anyway and plain coffee costs $5 minimum in the parks, it’s an easy thing to say yes to 😝

After dinner, we made our way back to the park and I grabbed a glow balloon on the way. This was brave but necessary LOL. We still had 3 rides to do and no stroller to keep the balloon, but I really wanted a clear Disney balloon with the Mickey ears inside, and I hadn’t seen them inside of the parks both days. So grabbing one in Downtown Disney was my best bet. I told my husband I’d tie my balloon up while we did rides and just pray to Mickey that I got to leave with it at the end of the day 😂

We get back into DCA, no real lines to get back inside. We headed over to Aunt Cass to try the jigglycake style cheesecake, which my husband has always wanted to try. Tasty, but we were stuffed on our dinner meal, so I didn’t eat much of it!

Next was the little mermaid ride, which I was very excited for. It ended up being one of my favorite dark rides because I loved the rooms for under the sea and kiss the girl. So pretty and reminiscent of the film. When we got done with that, my balloon was tied right where I left it. 1 out of 3 rides survived. 😂

We went to go check out Pixar Pier next, which I was very excited for! The main reason I decided to do a day at DCA instead of two days at my beloved Disneyland is because I wanted to see the pier/swings/ferris wheel/boardwalk-y vibes.

I really loved seeing all the cute carnival style games and I took a lot of photos in this area. It was really pleasant to walk after the sun went down. The lights on the water were beautiful, plus I’ve always loved fairground/amusement park vibes. This area had a lot of that.

We had a bit of time to kill before our LL for Midway Mania, so the balloon got tied, and we did Jessie’s carousel. My husband hurt like hell at this point and took a bench, but I hopped on a bunny and went for it. 😝 Super cute. I love carousels. Balloon made it. One more ride to go.

The Midway Mania ride was right next to the carousel, so we trotted over and did our last ride and last LL of the trip. I don’t super love that we didn’t use the last one, but idk, it really doesn’t bother me (nor did it at the time)z I couldn’t do the spinny or thrill rides at DCA and it’s just how the day played.

Midway Mania was coooooool. As mentioned earlier in this super long post, I love the point and shoot rides. I will say, this one did have some tech issues where we get held at certain points for 20-40 seconds, and that killed some of the momentum of our game/ride time. But the ride itself is awesome, a total blast, and I get why it has long waits all day!

Balloon was tied in the tucked away area I’d put it, so it was going back to the hotel with me! Success!

At this point, I misjudge our time and make a bad choice. I think we have time to trek back to Buena vista street to meet Mickey and shop before world of color. We get half way before I realize that not only will we not have enough time, but I took a wrong turn at some point and didn’t have us going in the right direction. I felt bad, mostly because we had blisters and the extra walking wasn’t necessary, but my husband was kind about the mistake. We go back to the Gardens area near the little mermaid ride to find a spot for the World of Color show. Due to my mistake, we didn’t have the greatest spot, and I’m short LOL. So I was hopeful I’d still get to see it.

The show was lovely. I will admit, I had much better views for the two shows in Disneyland the day before, but the water aspect is really breathtaking, and I could have planned better so it was my own fault. 😬 I love how the lights on the Ferris wheel and coaster light up with the show! I wasn’t expecting that and it blew me away! Even being little, I was able to see okay, considering the water shoots up so high. I was able to see some of the projection stuff too, very neat.

We take off after the show and head to Buena vista street, this time without the wrong turn lol.

We do some last minute shopping, take some ‘goodbye park’ photos, and I say goodbye to Disneyland on the way out.

At the hotel room, I obsessively look over photos, refuse to turn off the lights in my balloon, and look over my character signatures.

It was a dream. The whole thing. Certain ‘wrong moves’ on both days led to great surprises. Oh, a ride shut down? We wouldn’t have seen this character walking around if that hadn’t happened! Maybe I just refused to have a bad day or let anything get to me, or maybe I got a lot of Disney luck, but it doesn’t really matter. I will remember this trip for the rest of my life. I check the Disneyland map every day since we left to see if Tinkerbell is out cause I left my heart in Pixie Hollow. 😭♥️

If you read all of this, thank you. Tell me how you think I did! I mean, I know all that matters is that I had a good time (and boy did I), but I still want to hear your guys’ thoughts! 😁",6,1769029592.0,Disneyland,7,0.71,False

My rough plan was to start with Lacquer thinner then lots of sanding to get all the gunk off, then finish it anew and replace the chain\\hardware but haven't gotten that far.

I left ICU on July 30 2025 so nearly six months ago. I thought my walking would be further along now. I made really fast progress at first, from walking with a frame to crutches, to walking 5- 10 minutes round the block in October, to 20 minutes round the block in November. Well it’s 21 January now and I’m still doing my 20 minute walk. I can push to 30 minutes but then I’m done in for the day (no physio then possible). It’s not a matter of breathlessness (that’s fine) but my muscles can’t do anymore. I also can’t walk without doing it very consciously, so it’s not ‘proper walking’. Still very effortful, still wobbles here and there, especially if I’m on uneven pavement. I have to concentrate very hard sbd struggle to do walks that aren’t ’my usual walk’. I think the main problem though is that walking is no longer and automatic, natural process like it used to be. It’s very deliberate, it takes concentration and my muscles just can’t do any further. As such once I’ve done my daily walking practice I’m stuck in the house. I can’t ’pop down to the shops’ (a 30 minute walk there and back). I can’t do slopes. I hesitate at kerbs. For people that are further along, does normal walking come back? Will I be free to go out and about again, walk round the shops, go to town for a coffee, without having to think about walking like I did before? Is it just a matter of more time? I have no permanent conditions or injuries. It’s just a result of being bed bound for so long. Will I get my normal physical abilities and ability to live a normal life back again? I’m only 37… I feel like I’m 100 years old. Walking and physio take all my energy and all I can do afterwards is sit/lay down in my room. I feel like I have no life and I’m desperate to get some life and freedom back, and feel like a normal 37 year old again. How long is it likely to take? I thought I’d be further along by now, I’ve been doing all the right things… any words or wisdom from people who’ve been here and regained their walking ability again would be gratefully received.

Now you can enjoy warfare mode with mutants making every stalker's life objectively worse. Now the warfare zone is more unpredictable with mutant squads roaming about. Adjust the warfare settings to your liking if you feel the mutants are too much or too little with my mod enabled.

I play gamma exclusively, but it should work for other mod packs if it has Warfare ALife Overhaul. If using a modpack place my mod below any warfare patches using mod organizer. Lastly, if you are using my mod for gamma or other modpacks you are voiding technical support so preceded at your own peril (you already voiding tech support when using gamma warfare mode anyways...)

How do you handle snacking when tired? When I (f, 57) feel good, it's easy not to exceed my max daily calories but when I'm tired, it seems impossible. It's like eating gives me energy (not true) and I am  craving food all day. 
I do not drink caffeine, no coffee, no coke, so the uplifting effect of cafeine won't help me.

I am not very overweight, need to lose about 6 kg, but that's not going to happen when it goes on like this.

I do go to bed on time. 

Has anyone advice on how to stop craving food when tired? I really need some help.

Prescription pill bottles littered the ground around his bed like an alcoholic's empty cans. Sleep was, and always had been, his enemy. The hours that should be filled with blissful nothingness were instead steeped with things so horrifying that he found himself waking up in soiled sheets, vomiting and crying nearly every time his body succumbed to exhaustion. 

Visions of blurry shapes with long appendages, jointed in ways that couldn't be human, peeling strips of skin off his body like iberico ham. Angels with sinewy wings guiding him through hell. The souls of those convinced they've reached the wrong eternity, begging him to be their Messiah. Something is dragging him through an ever-tightening cave, the sharp walls tearing away at him slowly until bones must be broken so he can fit.

All the mental anguish of his sleep-deprived fugue state and his nighttime torture were driving him to the near brink of insanity. No, he mustn't sleep. He must drink another energy drink, chew another Adderall, do anything to save himself from what awaits him beyond the edge of consciousness. He wonders briefly, as he stares at the bread knife in his hand, if his brain would let him sleep if he were in pain.

His father leaving when he was born, him being diagnosed quirkless, all of his friends abandoning him and bullying him, being ostracized by the community at large, being suicide baited by his former best friend, his mom snapping from the strain of working to support him and becoming a stress baker who bearly even acknowledges him… if he listed anymore then we’d be here forever. So to make a long story short, his life sucks, BIG TIME.

But the event that really took the cake for being the worst thing that ever happened to him, was his idol “All Might” telling him “No, you can’t be a hero without a quirk”. Why was this so bad for him? Well, because it rendered 14 years of studying, prep, and enduring relentless bullying meaningless. No matter what he did, he would never become a hero. All because he wasn’t born lucky.

So he thought to himself “Fuck it. I have no place in a world with superpowers, and Katsuki’s advice seems legit enough. Might as well follow it.” So on the night of his birthday, he went out to make both Katsuki and everyone else that said “You’d be better off dead.” happy.

However, as he was about to jump off a bridge, someone stopped him. A blonde haired girl with an ungodly sweet personality and a grey haired girl who was missing an eye. They helped him get down from the ledge and took him to a local coffee shop, where they introduced themselves as Charlie and Vaggie. They said they were two college students taking a trip to Japan for the summer and had come across him attempting to end his own life while exploring the Shinigawa Ward. Unable to cope with the shame of almost throwing away his life and ruining the two girls fun time, he spilt the beans about everything that had happened leading up to the attempt.

To his utter surprise, not only were they accepting of his quirklessness, but they offered to be... his friends!?

Well; seeing this as an acceptable alternative to living the rest of his life a friendless quirkless nobody, he somewhat confusedly accepted. It started off small at first, just phone calls and talks on park benches. Until one day that is, when they went to a bar in Kamata Ward, and they got absolutely smashed. Then in a bizzare, alcohol fuelled discussion, they ended up revealing two things.

One, they were demons from hell. (more specifically, Charlie was the daughter of Lucifer and Vaggie was her fallen angel girlfriend) And two, they both had come to really, really, really really really… like him.

In the romantic way, too.

One thing lead to another, and the next thing Izuku knew, he was being both soft dommed and hard dommed by two unbelievably hot demon girls.

Hey guys! So I wanted to get your opinions on whether or not this sounds shady or if I should be concerned. Here's the whole spill:

Last summer, I was at a store (Sam's Club) just getting a couple of things with my mother. To give you an idea of who I am and what I look like, I'm eighteen-years-old and generally considered quite good looking. I don't add this to brag at all, but it's an important detail to explain why this guy came up to me. We’ll call him “Mark” for now, to make things easier.

So Mark approaches us from the food court, looks like a real business dude, and he says to my mother: ""I'm sorry, I swear I never do this out in public like this, but I couldn't help but notice that your son has a really cool air about him. I'm in the commercial marketing business, and I do ads and commercials for restaurants, stores, businesses, etc. I was wondering if I could get your contact info if you'd be interested in having your son act for us in one of our shoots."" Said he was from LA, and does commercial TV business in both Hollywood and Tampa Bay. I’m originally from nearby LA area, so I could understand some of the areas he was talking about.

Then he went on to keep apologizing for how unprofessional it seemed, and generally just seemed like a really nice dude who thought he had come upon a good opportunity and didn't want to miss it. He explained to us that in his business, he's the guy whose job it is to recruit actors and anybody who would look good in front of a camera. I think he thought I was still a minor, because he was mainly addressing my mother, so she told him that I was an adult and she’d let me make the decision. Now I’m a writer and a singer (in college, but I do those things as hobbies), so of course, I’m always open for any opportunities to promote myself and put my work out there. I told him this, and he said they most certainly could arrange something to be able to promote any talents I may have, so I ended up giving him my contact information. He gave me both of his Instagram pages, and from what I saw, they seemed really legit and lined up with everything he had told us about himself and the business he does.

Fast forward now to just a couple of days ago. After that interaction last summer, I never once heard a peep from Mark, he never texted me, never called me, so I somewhat disappointedly ended up concluding that he had decided he didn’t have any need for me after all. Then, out of the blue, two days ago he hits me up on text:

“Hey! I know it’s been a while, but do you remember me from Sam’s Club last summer? I’m the guy who approached you and your mother when you guys were in the store.”

We exchanged pleasantries again, he caught me up on everything he had been doing since then (which included him having changed businesses that he worked for, he no longer worked for the company that he was working for when he first met me). He told me that he was now in partnership with a couple of big business owners in my city who are really interested in upgrading the amount of commercial/media attention our city gets. Remember, I’m in South Dakota, so we’re not exactly known for any of that, lol. But it does go in alignment with a LOT of the business pushes that have happened in the past couple of years; business is booming in Rapid City and there have been a lot of businessmen from around the country who have moved here recently to try to take advantage of the crazy tourism we get during the summer. So this particular group of businessmen and Mark are trying to get things booming on the TV and media side of things in the city.

He continues and tells me that he’s building a “talent roster” for people who he thinks would be good in front of a camera, and whose talents he can put on display. Then he’ll run his roster by the bigwigs, and see who gets accepted for a potential gig and who doesn’t. He asked me if I’m still game to try it out, and I told him I am. He now wants to meet up over coffee on Saturday, so we’ve arranged that appointment. He’s going to give me all the details, tell me everything they’re planning on doing and how he thinks I fit into it. Then he mentioned that should I be put on the official roster, we’d have to discuss contract terms and everything before we finally get started.

Now that’s the huge problem: “contract terms”. I’m still eighteen, lol. I have no idea when a contract is peeling me off the wall or when it’s actually giving me a reasonable deal. But I guess I’ll deal with that when the time comes.

Sorry, that was a very long story, and kudos to you if you got to the end. But my question is, does anything seem off here? Does this sound like I could be walking straight into some quick-buck scam or does it sound legit?

Thanks so much. I’ve been pretty concerned about it recently, lol. I’m excited if it’s legit, but I don’t have nearly enough world experience to know whether or not it is.",0,1769028889.0,Advice,3,0.5,False

1qj9xwf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qj9xwf,16 Night Panama Canal Review on Coral Princess,"Sitting in LAX waiting on my flight back to ORD and want to share the highs and occasional lows of my trip…

This is my 4th princess cruise and probably my favorite. Sailed on the Coral Princess, the fleets oldest ship. Bus also it’s smallest! What it lacked in shiny newness it made up for in fabulous use of space.

No problems getting a deck chair. Chairs right by deck 14 lido pool were often taken early but by 1 or 2pm a few would always open up. Nice size pool, never felt crowded. 3 hot tubs, also never crowded. Great bands played daily by pool. Really good groups, one focused on island/caribe/reggae and other did pop hits. 

My cabin was on deck 12, under lido pool bar. I did guaranteed balcony and was pleasant surprised. A little noisy at times but never during sleeping hours so not really an issue. Love the sheeting on princess ships, very good thread count! Teeny tiny shower, but they all are. Loved sleep with balcony door cracked so I could fall asleep to wave sounds. 

The food was in MDR was really good. A solid 8 out of 10. Only sent back one dish, their version of beef brisket was nasty. A truly inedible mystery meat. However every appetizer and dessert was amazing. The buffet was also good. And plentiful and the service in both MDR and buffet was always above and beyond.

The entertainment was non stop with my favorites being the production shows. Great talent, very entertaining. Got quite lucky in casino for first three days. My luck eventually ran out and I ended up down $100 :-(

The port stops were great, Huatalco and Puntarenas were my fave. Went whale watching in Huatalco (saw humpbacks and it was so cool!) and went in a coffee plantation tour in CR that was a great experience. The canal transit was very cool, grateful I got to experience it.

I love warm weather cruising in the winter and this one was terrific. Sometimes in the Caribbean the ports all look and feel

alike. That was not the case on this cruise and I left the ship feeling like I really saw some lovely parts of the world.

1qj9umw,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1qj9umw/transference_with_therapist/,Transference with Therapist,"Hi guys, this is a situation that happened to me a while back, but I’m still finding myself ruminating over it. I would really appreciate your input.

I started therapy for the first time in January 2025. I quickly realised I was attracted to my therapist. I hoped she’d be cold and distant so I wouldn’t develop feelings but she was warm and very welcoming.

In just our second session, I disclosed my experience with SA, and she shared her own story in response. It felt like a pivotal moment in building emotional trust and connection between us. During that same session, she told me that she doesn’t just forget about clients when the session ends and that she thinks about me a lot.

In the third session, she told me I was beautiful and asked, “Have you ever had a boyfriend or girlfriend?” When I said no, she replied, “Well, they must all be blind.” That moment intensified my emotions and attachment. She continued to compliment my appearance in later sessions and said “I imagine you get a lot of attention because you’re very attractive.” At another point, when I told her I felt like a burden, she said, “You’re my priority.”

I eventually came out to her as a lesbian. She was the first person I ever told, and she said she was ""honoured"" and even admitted she sometimes questions her own sexuality from time to time.

She encouraged me to text her anytime if I felt low, and said we could even meet outside of sessions. Our hugs at the end of each session lasted 10–20 seconds… always tight and meaningful. 

One night, when things turned violent in my home, I texted her at 1AM in distress. I didn’t expect a reply, but she responded with: “I’m here for you not just as a therapist, but because I care x.” She even offered to send a taxi to bring me to her house to stay the night. I declined, but she then suggested we meet for coffee another time.

My feelings for her grew, and eventually I wrote her a letter and made her a CD with some of my favorite songs. My mom found it before I had the chance to give it to her. She immediately messaged my therapist to tell her I had “unnatural feelings” and demanded she cut off contact with me all before I got the chance to speak for myself.

I sent her a follow-up text to say the following:

""I’m really sorry. I feel so disheartened that this is how things unfolded. My mum found the gifts I made and was planning to give to you and immediately knew their meaning and context.

I never meant for this to happen and I’m so ashamed, but I completely understand if you think a break is necessary for the therapeutic process or even termination if you feel that is what’s best. I just wanted to acknowledge it myself rather than hearing it second hand.

I sincerely apologise if you’ve taken any offence at all or have made you feel uncomfortable. I know it’s very stupid and illogical. I understand the importance of your role, the ethical duties and would never want to jeopardise your career or life. I completely understand it would never be reciprocated and I never expected it to be. I just wanted to say thank you again for everything. I can’t thank you enough. My appreciation and respect is beyond measure.""

And she replied with this:

""Therapists cannot accept gifts. You have not at all made me feel uncomfortable or offended. As my client and as your over the age of 16 confidentiality is paramount and termination etc is your decision. Take some time to work on what we discussed yesterday. I wish you all the best in the future.""

She texted my mum to say she regretted to inform that she would be stopping contact. I was absolutely heartbroken at the time. Then 2 weeks passed by and she showed up at my workplace after termination (she knew where I worked). She called my name, asked how I was, told me she sought out help from supervision and said I could come back to therapy any time I wanted. I asked if I could give her a hug and she didn’t answer, she just embraced me in her arms. When I was watching her walk down the stairs to leave she never turned back.

I didn’t contact her again until 3 months later when I got a bipolar diagnosis and she responded by saying “I ask that you refrain from contacting me, respecting your mom’s wishes”.

Overall, the situation has me really confused. The mixed signals are crazy. What do you guys think? Did she simply get scared once a third party found out and stepped in, and then tried to reinforce boundaries way too late? Am I imagining her breaking boundaries?

I would really appreciate any advice, thank you! :)",4,1769028658.0,lgbt,3,0.84,False

Today was the first of those days
I went to a coffee shop and a museum, got a haircut and went back to the hotel
It was just, ok… I felt alone most of the time. My anxiety stopped me from reaching out and talk to people and I did not feel like I had the opportunity (and I certainly did not create one)
My friend came back from work for a few hours and went to a work dinner
Now I’m in my head about what to do
Should I just go to eat dinner and go back to the hotel? Should I go to a gay bar? I don’t know Spanish and I’m pretty shy
I can go to a sauna because I think Spanish men are hot, but I’m so in my head that I don’t think I will enjoy it and I’m not sure I am horny enough…
I feel like a fish out of water and on the other hand that I am wasting an amazing opportunity of the possibility of “doing whatever I want”
So, how do you handle yourself alone abroad? And do you feel good about it?",1,1769028611.0,askgaybros,0,0.67,False

1qj9phz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qj9phz/how_to_confront_a_close_friend_about_crush/,How To Confront A Close Friend About Crush,"I (21F) have pretty recently made a friend (20F) who I really like and would maybe like to ask to be my girlfriend. We became friends about six months ago and have been pretty inseparable since then. We spend a lot of time together in and out of academic obligations, and often accidentally hang out for upwards of four hours just by bumping into each other and deciding to keep it going. I had really been enjoying having a best friend but about a month ago I started to kind of feel more for her. 



We spend a lot of time watching stuff, doing homework, making crafts, talking, and just sitting in silence together. And every time we have to go it feels like neither of us want to leave. She also started coming up with different jokes or stories where she touches me on the arm or will put her hand on my face and look into my eyes, and I've kind of done the same. We also make plenty of jokes about how we're always together and joke about being in a rom com together on occasion. When we sit on a sofa we usually sit as close as humanly possible and at one point while watching something on my laptop she put it in her lap and laid back so she was resting against my chest. She's also recently started to rest her head on me a lot as we get deeper into hanging out and when it's later in the night sometimes we just sit there in silence in the dark looking at each other until somebody says we should go. We've also both discussed stuff like our preferences for relationships in passing and everything lines up really well. I have a lot of close friends but this feels different. However, I know some people are just really close with their friends like this and I don't want to misinterpret what might just be a really great platonic bond. I'd be totally fine being her friend forever if that was the case. 

  
The only information/indication I've got of any interest in anybody else was her briefly mentioning that one of her friends jokingly flirts with her and that she's really pretty. But it didn't seem like  interest, just a fact/expressing her confusion. I would really like to date her but I think just because of the amount we hang out it wouldn't work to do what a lot of people suggest in all the threads I've read, which is asking her to get coffee/go on a real date. I think if we do it we're either all in as a couple and we just start being more physically intimate (plus eventually go on real defined dates) or we're gonna just be friends. I'm not really sure how I should bring it up to her or if I should at all. Most of the friends I've talked to agree she seems interested but I think it's just hard for me to believe that for my own reasons and also because I want to be careful and not ruin something good. I'm also a little worried about creating awkwardness with our mutual friends but I think it will be fine. 



I'd just like a little advice on how to do this/minimize awkwardness with potential rejection, or if maybe I should just leave it. Thanks :).",2,1769028344.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I moved to London at the beginning of this year and have been enjoying my days a lot (apart from the days in winter when it was dark by 3 pm...). I'm from Canada and decided to move here to fight my inner demons (Read: I wanted a change of pace and experience European culture).

I want to meet a girl to go to museums with, to have coffee and talk deep topics on the balcony at 10 pm with, to go on weekend trips to Italy and see Roman statues and have authentic pizza with, but most of all, someone who simply enjoys my company as much I enjoy theirs.

About myself, I'm 26, Asian, 6 feet, and ever since I moved here, I've been doing a hella more cooking so I'm sure I can whip up a feast for you when you visit! Here is a photo of me:  [https://imgbox.com/VByqRnit](https://imgbox.com/VByqRnit), would like to exchange pics in chat :)

I play games a lot on my PC, and my most played recently is Dead by Daylight, it's the only game where you see Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Halloween, and Alien characters all work together to repair some scuffed generators. On the side, I've been playing a good amount of Genshin and it's definitely quite a grind as a f2p player hahaha.

As well, I've been takin German classes for the past weeks and I'd say that sie sind sehr interessant, but my progress is so slow and it'd be great to converse with some German speakers outside of my A1 class lol.

Tuesday, January 21 • Waxing Crescent Moon 

Dropping this REVISED playlist today because there's a tiny sliver of moon tonight (about 10% illuminated, three days old) which is exactly what this playlist sounds like. You know how most indie/alt rock playlists are all jangly guitars and upbeat anthems? Yeah, this isn't that.

""Chill Indie/Alt Rock: Drift"" is for when you need to let your brain untether a bit. This is the atmospheric, textural side of indie rock. Still indie, still rock, just built for a different headspace. It has a sister playlist (Ultimate Indie/Alt Rock: Drive ) that does the other thing. I like to give you the energy of the moment so you can go with the flow. This used to be one playlist which I revised, refreshed and decided to make into two. 

Think less coffee shop energy, more rainy window contemplation (or ""it's freezing outside and I'm gonna sit this one out and veg at home""). Less road trip sing-along, more late night where you're processing your entire existence (ok, well maybe that's just me). The melodies are there but they wrap around you instead of hitting you in the face.

This is what you put on when you want the world to slow down for a minute. When you need music that understands that sometimes feeling something quietly is more powerful than feeling it loudly.

I am a project manager in the construction industry with 20+ years experience and high-profile portfolio, yet i struggle to even find relevant jobs or get interest online from the LinkedIn community. By 'relevant' i mean to my salary/day rate expectations and seniority level. I don't know if its my age, pay ask or what, but where are all the jobs gone?

I also suspect that I am doing something fundamentally wrong is either searching or applying for job posts, and that linkedin in particular have been taken over by AI and AI filtering. My observation is that uploading a 'normal' CV—as strong and solid as it is—simply goes nowhere if it was not engineered by some form of AI to trick the screening barrier. No human looks at you if you don't hit X% of exact keywords and other bullshit that someone behind the algorithm believe to be useful to pick candidates. It becomes a painful, tedious task to specifically tailor the CV to each post just to try and pass the AI gatekeeping. It's dreadful.

Sorry for the rant, but what others are doing? In particular if you're hunting for a senior/executive role and exhausted your network and your caffeine intake (from doing endless 'coffee' meetings...).

And then, if you are playing the AI game, what are you using and how? I looked at a few platforms such as LoopCV, LazyApply, Careerflow, etc...what a whole lot of rubbish. I can see it might work for someone just starting in the job market but for a heavy career history these are not suitable tools in my opinion as they do not capture the breadth and depth of experience, soft skills or nuanced/niche expertise one develop on a long career.

Just to add that my LinkedIn profile is robust and tick all the boxes. The only thing i don't do is post on the platform. ",4,1769027972.0,ContractorUK,6,1.0,False

This morning, I very nearly ruined a batch by forgetting the additive I'd created the entire recipe around. I put the shit in a brightly colored bowl with a piece of paper underneath pointing to it so I wouldn't forget. I went into goddamn automaton mode trying to bring the batter to emulsion and, because I'm me, forgot all about the bright pink bowl with the label under it up until it was time to pour. If we still lived in caves, I would have been a jaguar's lunch by now  
  
Ok so *ruined* is a bit overdramatic. The soap would've turned out fine without it, but the additive (flax gel btw) was kind of the whole reason for the batch. I managed to save it by blending it through the main color after I'd split off the batter. Ruined the itps I had going, but whatever. Thankfully this is a just batch for my sister. I doubt she'll notice or care so long it smells like pear cider and gets her clean. I only want the best for my dear sister, but she expects a B+ out of me at best. I like using her lowered expectations to my advantage. 

I have a funnier/stupider one. It's long, so if you're not up for a yappuccino... Idk what to tell you. Don't read it lol. 

This year, the before Valentine's is a Friday the 13th. Since my second V-Day batch didn't happen (will try again for White Day or retool it for spring) I decided to do a ""Lawyer friendly day-between-Thursday-the-12th-and-Saturday-the-14th horror slasher bane of horny camp counselors (who may or may not wear a hockey and carry a machete (depending on the entry) -inspired"" soap. 

But because I'm me, I loaded way too much dip on my chip. 

Wanted to keep it simple. *My idea of simple* (only a lil bit convoluted.) Hot pink and black colorway (since this was still kind of a V-day soap). Hot pink drip. Cute cheeky machete embeds. Picked a well behaved, crowd pleasing FO (black raspberry vanilla). Drew, drafted, 3D printed and poured silicone molds for the machete embeds. Drew, drafted and 3D printed a couple of stamps for the cut bars. I had this cute lil idea in the bag. Or so I thought. 

Expectation, [here ](https://i.imgur.com/mcfXCAt.png)(the og concept before I hit up soap calc)  
I won't show you the reality yet. 

Mixing and pouring went swimmingly. I had to make a zillion of those stupid embeds since they were so fragile (my mistake, should have made a deeper mold). I CPOP everything that doesn't have milk or honey in it, so after the pour 'n top detailing, straight into my mildly warm oven it went. It looked and smelled gorgeous. I was so psyched for this batch.

Later that night, the ADHD tax collector came a knockin' 

FF to that evening. I'd come in from a meeting chilly and in need of a hot meal. I'm usually a light eater, but since I hadn't had anything but water, coffee and an applesauce cup since breakfast the day before, I decided I'd treat myself to a Marie Calender's frozen mac and cheese. Without thinking, my single-track minded ass went straight to the oven and preheated it. 

You may be thinking: ""*Reddit user kiss-shot (no relation to the anime vampire girl), isn't it standard practice to keep the oven light on when CPOPing? If anything, to keep at least a little heat going during the saponification process?? Dummy???""*

To that I'd say, *""You're totally right sickeningly gorgeous, terribly lovable, high tolerance for rambling yapathons-having hypothetical reader. Also, you smell nice. I love you.*"" Sadly, the pilot light in our oven went out 5 years ago and it seems that the building super did too because I haven't seen his ass around since. Could I have replaced the light myself? Of course. I mean, I personally wouldn't trust me with incandescent bulbs and hot stuff *simultaniously*, but the government allowed me to shoot guns in the name of national defense, so think I can handle a rinkadink oven and a lightbulb. Did I ever get around to actually replacing the light the half decade since the it died?   
...

The past is in the past and there's nothing we can do about it. We must keep moving forward, or may we be forever sandwiched between should-haves and what-ifs. Anyway, once the smell of scorched melt and pour simmering in fragrance oil hit my beak, I lept out of bed with the quickness, realizing my cluck up. My oven heats slow, thank, and the loaf mold was silicone. I yanked the loaf from oven to find only a widdle bit of a total fk'ing disaster. The tops were a wash. My machetes we thin dribbles down the lip of the mold. Swirls ruined. Also, it was really fucking hot. Thinking fast as I could, I got a knife and scraped away the molten, soapy muffin top. Bubbling and near-liquid, it sloughed off effortlessly straight into the kitchen sink. After cursing and feeling sorry for myself, I accessed the damage. The soap, once cooled, was pretty damn solid. Harder than it would've been if I hadn't cold to very hot oven processed it. Even if it wasn't fully saponofied, It'd need to be cut soon if it was gonna cut at all. I gave it an hour to cool off and did just that.   
  
They cut beautifully, but I could tell they were way too hard to stamp. I'd messed up again. Sucks, as otherwise they were lovely (outside of the bowing from overfilling my mold). I tried stamping them anyway, because I can't leave well enough alone, knowing I have the upper body strength of an anemic inchworm. The results were unfortunate. 

But... [I had beautiful bars](https://files.catbox.moe/ssuvca.png) (colors are bolder IRL)! Still smelled nice too (smelled like they were supposed to, truth be told, I'm not a big fan of BRV). Most importantly, I still had a *canvas*. A chance. Back to my iPad I went. I figured I could try stamping again if I made a new surface. The next morning I whipped up a small batch of soap batter, colored it black. Then I used my plotter and some thin plastic material to make a stencil of the outline of the copyright compliant Jheyson Uorhees mask. Masks for the mask. Could I have used soap dough for this? Yes. Probably would've worked out better tbh. Did I? No. Don't ask questions you're not prepared to get dumb answers for. This is me we're talking about, not someone *patient* or *reasonable*.   
  
Very carefully, I masked the shapes onto the bars. Think screen printing, but on several 2.5"" x 3.5"" surfaces. Finnicky work for stiff, arthritic talons like mine. And it worked! Kind of. It worked enough for me. Satisfied with my efforts, I spritzed the fresh layer down with alcohol and let it rest. After a couple of hours, I returned to mica stamp the masks onto the fresh surface. 

It ...didn't work😄! I mean, the design [sort of took on a few bars](https://files.catbox.moe/8dg0we.jpg). Overall, this shit was cheeks! The concept was sound, but my skills were silent. Either I waited too long to stamp or the layers were too thin, or there was something funky with my recipe, what have you. The mica barely stuck. It was patchy. I even tried filling in the gaps with mica painting. That just made things worse! I was crestfallen. Sickened. Squirrely. All that work just to end up with bunch of bars I wouldn't even give away. But I don't cry over things that can't cry over me, so I'll persist. I'm sure next month's attempt will work better, or give me an even funnier story to irritate you all with. Either way, I gain. 

The Jei'suhns are in the back of my curing closet now. As of my last peek, most of the black mask layers are cracked and seperating. Lovely. I'll keep that in mind in case I deliberately want that effect for future batches. For now I'm just gonna let them dry up, cut off what I can and give them away. It's still good soap. I'll take it from the top later. Lucky for me, there's a Friday the 13th in March too. And after that, November.

Chapter 209 : 10/10

Chapter 210 : 9.2/10

Chapter 211 : 9.5/10

Chapter 212 : 9.6/10

Wow, this was pretty cool. I'm honestly pleasantly surprised to see this kind of stuff in the rebellion arc aswell

On the surface, isn't rebellion the last arc of SH? Yet that doesn't stop shadows house from introducing those kind of scenes and flashbacks about the characters that happened in ch211 and 212. 

Lou and Ricky are honestly so cute together, it's also nice to see Lou be much more cheerful and have much more expressions

Eve and Ram, too. It looks like Eve was probably the person she was able to socialize the most

But Emilyko's words just make me depressed tbh.. Her past is sad as hell but even that is nothing compared to the fact that she thinks she's on the receiving end of all good, ""troublesome"" and wants to move away from them in the future

I swear to god if that actually happens i'm gonna sob so much my body is going to go from 70% water to maybe even 0

It also seems Shaun was going to talk about her with Lou and Ricky, but he couldn't phrase it well, then Lou deducted he likes her and then stellas visit..

Thing is.. Emi's completely wrong. If anything, she's the glue that held everyone together. She's not at all at the receiving end of everything

First of all, she got along with everyone at the debutant party. Her combined efforts with Shaun and Ram, aswell as her act of kindness towards Patrick (which led to him giving her the scissors later) made everyone get along well. She's also the one who saved Kate, and the one Kate learned hell of a lot aswell. She's also saved Kate during the oliver incident, did well during the phantom incident, and always cheered everyone up. And don't even get me started on how spectacular she performed at the debut, even tho i explained most of it already

Even now.. After talking about her past and future intentions, she cheered Shaun up. The kiss was cute and all, but like, it was as if she got ""carried away"" and after talking about her issues went back to ""deceiving everybody"" by acting all kind and cheerful

Man, i really hope John and Patrick find a way to cheer her up. But at first, they have to find out about her worries in the first place, and that isn't possible without Shaun or Emilyko herself

I really hope Shaun breaks her promise and talks about it with Kate aswell. I feel like out of anyone, Kate will probably the best person to cheer her up, but then again, she doesn't unfortunately even know of her worries

But then again, Kate's pretty stressed too. Tho i feel like she'll try to help Emi as soon as she hears about it because it'd be a rlly high priority, but it wouldn't be too bad if John and Patrick would be the ones to help her

Chapter 213 : 9.3/10

Chapter 214 : 9.5/10

Chapter 215 : 9.4/10

Chapter 216 : 9.4/10

(ch213) This is pretty cool. I also could guess her brother was john (shaun) before i could say it. AFAIK he has alot of siblings so it was pretty obvious i suppose

Well, finished. the show is still on its trope of more ""peaceful"" times where everybody is getting along 

We got to see big Louise, as i guess the true coffee still took some kind of toll on her, and thankfully Benjamin got her out of depression 

After all, Morphs do not really have evil intent.. atleast as of now, because well, the morphs did take over the mirrors house back then, that reminds me of my thoughts on why the morphs act so differently now.

I wrote it yesterday but i like that the show has those kind of scenes at a supposed final arc of the show. It's sad to think it'll end soon, but atleast the manga is still ongoing.

More importantly.. What's up with Belle? Revenge? I didn't read the next chapter but i did read the next chapter's name

Now that i think about it, Isabelle and Mirabelle probably have been pretty rough on her. And it most definetely has to do something with the brainwashing being undone 

Belle probably remembered her past and combined with rather rough treatment of isabelle and mirabelle she probably wanted to get some kind of ""revenge"" on them for the shadows stealing her name and stuff

Could this be another depiction of the reality you wouldn't like to accept? Kate and Jeremy wanted them to unbrainwash the children for everyones sake but it backfired because not everyone is smart like Ben, or was lucky enough to stumble upon Shaun and Ricky before doing anything careless

Kate never had ill intentions for the belles, but she didn't take the fact they could misunderstand the situation they're in due to their memories. After all, Suzie assumed shadows are the bad guys at first and Louise blamed herself for stealing Lou's identity 

Ben was different though. Not only he figured out everything himself, but he spoke to his shadow because he realised Benjamin treated him well this entire time. He shared his worries with him and Benjamin accepted them

And belle is also probsies different, but not in a good way unfortunately. 

This basically promotes individuality and teaches that even shadows imitating humans can be different from the people they imitated and that it's a good thing. 

Chapter 217 : 8.9/10  
Chapter 218 : 9.7/10  
Chapter 219 : 9.5/10

Well, it seems Joseph is her ally. I'm a bit confused though, did the convo happen right there infront of Lewis? Wouldn't it mean they are planning to dispose or restrain him somewhere if they don't care about talking about such a topic infront of Lewis?

Wouldn't that also be a contradiction to Kate's trap to show that all to Joseph? If Joseph is just on her side wouldn't he have no need to gain evidence that Anthony is rebelling against TGG if he's trying to work against TGG aswell? That is really confusing

Or was that to gain evidence of rebellion? But if Joseph's word is trusted for granted anyway, why would they need to confirm that either way??.. That's weird, i'd like to assume that convo didn't take place infront of Anthony, but the star bearers wee also shown when Joseph was talking

Speaking of Belle aswell, seems Anthony did something bad to her. Could it also be that that's how they found out about the rebellion and that Kate is the possible mastermind? Lewis saying that did come right after the chapter with Belle, afterall

But eh, i bet Anthony could figure Kate's hostile intentions towards him either way. So that probably doesn't matter

Anyway, peak as always. Kate is probably in a better position now if Joseph is on her side, but there's still hella people to deal with. Anthony and the brainwashed children in the children wing + entire adults building excluding Joseph. That if he doesn't lie. It's just 10 more chapters of mangadex but i wonder if i can find the translation for the other chapters elsewhere

There’s a certain magic in the ritual of brewing a cup of exceptional coffee. It’s the fragrant steam rising, the promise of a perfectly balanced sip, and the knowledge that you’ve chosen something truly special. But that magic starts with the beans themselves. The term “fresh” in coffee means more than just a recent roast date; it signifies a carefully curated journey from farm to cup, designed to deliver unparalleled flavor.

When you **buy fresh coffee beans**, you’re looking for a coffee that hasn't languished on a shelf. Many roasters offer coffee that might be days or weeks old by the time it reaches you. At Intelligentsia, we’ve built our legacy on a different approach. As a **Direct Trade Pioneer**, we cultivate deep, long-term partnerships with farmers, ensuring we not only secure the highest quality beans but also support sustainable practices and pay premiums far above fair trade standards. This commitment is the first step in delivering an extraordinary experience.

Our dedication extends to the moment you order. We practice **Roast-to-Order**, meaning your chosen coffee is roasted specifically for you and shipped out immediately. This process guarantees that the vibrant aromatics and complex flavors are at their absolute peak when they arrive at your door, not diminished by transit or storage.

Why does this matter for your morning brew?

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Coffee’s flavor profile degrades rapidly after roasting. Our roast-to-order model ensures you experience coffee at its zenith, showcasing bright acidity and nuanced tasting notes.
*   **Ethical Sourcing Transparency:** Our Direct Trade relationships mean you can trace your coffee back to the farm, confident in the quality and the people behind it.
*   **Exceptional Flavor Clarity:** From the bold, syrupy body of our legendary **Black Cat Espresso** to the delicate fruit notes in our rotating **Direct Trade Single Origins**, freshness is the key to unlocking these distinct profiles.

Ready to taste the difference true freshness makes? Explore our curated selection of **Direct Trade Single Origins** or discover the convenience of an **Intelligentsia Subscription**, featuring our Roaster’s Choice, Seasonal, or Espresso options with always free shipping.

Here are my two cents for r/saas,"After over engineering too many failed projects, I switched to a strict protocol. In the last year, I built using this framework 4 apps doing over 2K mmr each aprox.

Here is the exact framework I developed over the last year to ship an MVP in under a week:

1. Frontend alway first, I never start with the backend. I use **v0** or [**bolt.new**](http://bolt.new) to generate the UI code immediately.
   * Its easier to build backend logic when you see the product.
   * Goal: Polish is priority. If the MVP looks bad, users assume the code is too.
2. The landing page: Static hero sections usually dont convert enough, but 3D libraries take too long and you actually have to know how to use them.
   * I use **Google nano banana** or a similar tool to generate the first and last frames of a hero element (like a coffee cup splashing), then animate the transition. It looks pretty profession and it only takes a few minutes.
3. Backend & Payments
   * **Supabase** (Free tier, handles auth, more than enough for validation phasel).
   * **Stripe**.
4. The Feedback Loop **(This is one of the most important steps that is often underestimated)** Don't guess what users want. Add a feedback tool immediately.
   * [**leanvote.com**](http://leanvote.com) (I prefer it over Featurebase as its cheaper and gets the job done).
   * If the feedback board is empty after launch, thats a red flag. If people are voting, I know exactly what to build next.
5. Marketing: Go Niche
   * Find the specific sub (eg, r/productivity) and post for feedback, not just sales.
   * I create AI review videos or whatever and post them on reels and tiktok. One viral hit can bring over a hundred users
6. I give an idea **one week** to gain traction
   * If there is no positive sentiment or votes on Leanvote I kill it.
   * With this stack, I can ship fast. There is no point adding features to an app no one uses.

TLDR: Build the UI with **v0**, animate the hero with **Nano Banana**, add **Leanvote** for feedback, and ship to niche subs. If you get no traction kill the project and move to the next.",2,1769027578.0,SaaS,5,1.0,False

But I haven’t been retaining enough water lately so I started deluding myself that maybe it wasn’t the magnesium, it had to be the citric acid that I hate the taste of, right? So I bought the stuff and followed the recipe. Made a huge batch even. I thought I was so smart.

Nope. It *is* the friggin magnesium. It tastes so gross. I have not been able to find a flavor mix powder or liquid (like mio or crystal lite) that I am not allergic or sensitive to. I can’t drink this trash unflavored, but I can’t think of what to add to it that doesn’t just enhance the revolting taste to even grosser heights. I tried adding some orange juice at 5:45 this morning in a rush on my way out the door, but it made it worse (and also now there is pulp).

What are y’all doing for flavor that isn’t a premade mix (I cant have “natural flavor” or maltodextrin or stevia along with one other ingredient I’m still trying to figure out)? I also use this mix in my coffee (not today, I had enough of my old magnesium free mix left). Am I doomed?

Edit: my usual homemade electrolyte mix is sodium and potassium salts. I don’t have an issue with the taste of those. It’s the magnesium I can’t stand.",0,1769027442.0,POTS,19,0.5,False

1qj986c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qj986c/my_mother_used_to_say_that_houses_are_alive_she/,My Mother used to say that Houses are Alive. She wasn’t wrong.,"I moved back into my mother’s house two months ago.

It wasn’t part of the plan. The plan was to rent somewhere small, get my bearings again after she died, and maybe try to rebuild the pieces of my life that fell apart with her. But when I went to collect her things, I couldn’t leave. There was something about the house, something that felt like unfinished business.

It’s the same old two-story I grew up in. White siding, creaky porch, the faint smell of dust and lavender.

My mother loved that smell. She said it calmed the house down.

Even as a kid, though, I never felt calm here. I used to tell her the walls made noises when I was alone, little groans, sighs, a kind of hum when I cried.

She’d laugh and say *“Old houses settle, Clara. They creak because they’re alive in their own way.”*

I thought she meant it metaphorically. I don’t anymore.

The first few nights back were normal enough. Lonely, yes. Too quiet.

I couldn’t sleep in my old bedroom, it still had those faint outlines on the wall from where I’d taped up posters, like ghosts of teenage years I’d rather forget. So I took my mother’s room instead. Her perfume lingered on the curtains, and the bed still dipped on her side, as if she’d only just gotten up.

I started cleaning during the day. Sorting through her things. Trying to make the place feel like *mine*.

That’s when it started, small things, things I told myself were coincidence.

One afternoon I caught myself thinking *this dresser would* look *better by the* window. The next morning, it was. I laughed it off, assuming I’d moved it and forgotten.

But then it happened again.

I was reaching for the hallway light switch, but the switch wasn’t there. Instead, it was on the *other* wall, right where my hand had hesitated a moment before.

My stomach dropped, like missing a step on the stairs.

I told myself I was misremembering, that grief makes people fuzzy. That night, I walked through the house taking pictures, of the layout, of where everything was, so I could prove to myself it wasn’t moving.

The next day, the photos didn’t match.

It wasn’t dramatic, not at first. Doors an inch off, stair count one higher. The kitchen window slightly taller. I thought maybe I was going insane. I even scheduled an appointment with a therapist. But then, the house started… helping me.

When I’d think about coffee, I’d find the mug already waiting on the counter.  
When I’d feel cold, the heat would hum to life without me touching the thermostat.  
One night, I couldn’t find my phone, I whispered, “Where did I leave it?” and the bedroom light flickered, like a nod. I found it glowing on the nightstand.

It felt like the house cared.

It was subtle, intimate, almost maternal. Like it wanted to take care of me the way she used to.

I told myself that was comforting.

But comfort doesn’t last here.

The first time I got angry, I felt it breathe.

I was trying to open a jammed drawer, my mother’s old jewelry box, the one with the music that never worked, and it wouldn’t budge. I yanked harder, muttering under my breath, *“For God’s sake, open!”*

Every door in the house slammed at once.

The windows rattled. The air pressure changed, like before a storm. And then… it was still.

I stood there shaking, trying to laugh it off. *“Old houses,”* I whispered. But I could feel something watching me, not from a corner or doorway, but from the walls themselves.

After that, I started testing it.

When I felt sad, the lights dimmed.

When I panicked, the hallway stretched, I swear to you, it elongated, the end of it sliding further away as I ran. When I calmed down, it shrank again.

I told myself it was grief. Stress. Trauma. All the buzzwords therapists love to use.

But then, I started noticing something worse.

The house wasn’t reacting *to* me anymore. It was *anticipating.*

I’d reach for the faucet, it would turn before my fingers touched it. I’d think about checking the mail, and hear the front door unlatch on its own. I’d dream about my mother, and wake up to find her perfume thick in the air, as if she’d been standing right over me.

The final straw was the basement.

I’ve always hated that basement. As a kid, I refused to go down there. My mother kept the door locked most of the time anyway. Said it was for *storage,* though I don’t ever remember her storing anything.

Last week, I was sitting in the living room when I heard something moving beneath the floorboards. Slow, deliberate, like someone dragging furniture.

I froze. Then, I heard a whisper:

*“Come see what I’ve made for you.”*

It was my mother’s voice.

I wanted to run, but the hallway had already shifted, the front door was gone. Only one door remained open. The basement.

I don’t remember walking down the stairs. I just remember the smell, wet earth, lavender, and something metallic underneath.

The basement was larger than it should’ve been. The floor sloped downward, the walls bending in impossible curves. The wallpaper from upstairs bled into concrete, as though the house was *growing downward.*

At the center was a new door. One I’d never seen.

It was painted white, but wet, like the paint hadn’t dried. I touched it, and the door *breathed.*

The wood expanded against my palm, warm and pulsing. I stepped back, trembling.

The whisper came again, closer this time:

*“You’ve been thinking so loudly, Clara.”*

*“We only wanted to help.”*

I screamed and ran back up the stairs, but they wouldn’t end. The steps kept repeating, looping like an optical illusion. The house was folding in on itself, reconfiguring. Every thought I had became a direction.

*Don’t close in:* the ceiling lowered.  
*Don’t lock me in:* the door vanished.  
*Stop stop stop:* the walls pulsed harder, almost shuddering.

I blacked out.

When I woke up, I was in bed. Morning light filtering through the curtains. Everything normal again. The furniture in its place.

For a while, I convinced myself it had been a nightmare.

Until I saw the note on my dresser. My mother’s handwriting.

*“Don’t leave again. The house gets lonely.”*

The note was written on wallpaper, wallpaper that matched the basement.

I’ve tried leaving. I’ve *tried.*

Every time I pack my bags, something goes wrong. The tires deflate. The front door locks itself. My phone refuses to dial anyone but *“Mom.”*

And she answers.

Sometimes I hear her humming through the vents at night, the same lullaby she sang when I was small. Sometimes I smell that lavender perfume, and the walls ripple softly, as if pleased.

I think the house is keeping me safe.

No...

I think it’s keeping me.

Because last night, I dreamt of that white door again. I could hear breathing on the other side, slow, steady, in sync with mine.

When I woke up, there was a new door in the hallway. This one red. Wet. Waiting.

I think it wants to make me part of it.

Maybe that’s what happened to her.

Maybe that’s why the house always felt alive.

If anyone reading this knows anything about old homes, foundations that shift, blueprints that don’t stay consistent, please tell me if this is possible. Tell me there’s a reason.

Because I looked up property records.

This house has stood here since 1913. It’s been sold sixteen times. Every owner listed as “deceased on property.”

But there’s one detail that makes my skin crawl.

Each record lists a different floor plan.

And the most recent one, the one dated this year, has a new room added.

A bedroom.

One afternoon I caught myself thinking *this dresser would* look *better by the* window. The next morning, it was. I laughed it off, assuming I’d moved it and forgotten.

But then it happened again.

I was reaching for the hallway light switch, but the switch wasn’t there. Instead, it was on the *other* wall, right where my hand had hesitated a moment before.

My stomach dropped, like missing a step on the stairs.

I told myself I was misremembering, that grief makes people fuzzy. That night, I walked through the house taking pictures, of the layout, of where everything was, so I could prove to myself it wasn’t moving.

The next day, the photos didn’t match.

It wasn’t dramatic, not at first. Doors an inch off, stair count one higher. The kitchen window slightly taller. I thought maybe I was going insane. I even scheduled an appointment with a therapist. But then, the house started… helping me.

When I’d think about coffee, I’d find the mug already waiting on the counter.  
When I’d feel cold, the heat would hum to life without me touching the thermostat.  
One night, I couldn’t find my phone, I whispered, “Where did I leave it?” and the bedroom light flickered, like a nod. I found it glowing on the nightstand.

It felt like the house cared.

It was subtle, intimate, almost maternal. Like it wanted to take care of me the way she used to.

I told myself that was comforting.

But comfort doesn’t last here.

The first time I got angry, I felt it breathe.

I was trying to open a jammed drawer, my mother’s old jewelry box, the one with the music that never worked, and it wouldn’t budge. I yanked harder, muttering under my breath, *“For God’s sake, open!”*

Every door in the house slammed at once.

The windows rattled. The air pressure changed, like before a storm. And then… it was still.

I stood there shaking, trying to laugh it off. *“Old houses,”* I whispered. But I could feel something watching me, not from a corner or doorway, but from the walls themselves.

After that, I started testing it.

When I felt sad, the lights dimmed.

When I panicked, the hallway stretched, I swear to you, it elongated, the end of it sliding further away as I ran. When I calmed down, it shrank again.

I told myself it was grief. Stress. Trauma. All the buzzwords therapists love to use.

But then, I started noticing something worse.

The house wasn’t reacting *to* me anymore. It was *anticipating.*

I’d reach for the faucet, it would turn before my fingers touched it. I’d think about checking the mail, and hear the front door unlatch on its own. I’d dream about my mother, and wake up to find her perfume thick in the air, as if she’d been standing right over me.

The final straw was the basement.

I’ve always hated that basement. As a kid, I refused to go down there. My mother kept the door locked most of the time anyway. Said it was for *storage,* though I don’t ever remember her storing anything.

Last week, I was sitting in the living room when I heard something moving beneath the floorboards. Slow, deliberate, like someone dragging furniture.

I froze. Then, I heard a whisper:

*“Come see what I’ve made for you.”*

It was my mother’s voice.

I wanted to run, but the hallway had already shifted, the front door was gone. Only one door remained open. The basement.

I don’t remember walking down the stairs. I just remember the smell, wet earth, lavender, and something metallic underneath.

The basement was larger than it should’ve been. The floor sloped downward, the walls bending in impossible curves. The wallpaper from upstairs bled into concrete, as though the house was *growing downward.*

At the center was a new door. One I’d never seen.

It was painted white, but wet, like the paint hadn’t dried. I touched it, and the door *breathed.*

The wood expanded against my palm, warm and pulsing. I stepped back, trembling.

The whisper came again, closer this time:

*“You’ve been thinking so loudly, Clara.”*

*“We only wanted to help.”*

I screamed and ran back up the stairs, but they wouldn’t end. The steps kept repeating, looping like an optical illusion. The house was folding in on itself, reconfiguring. Every thought I had became a direction.

*Don’t close in:* the ceiling lowered.  
*Don’t lock me in:* the door vanished.  
*Stop stop stop:* the walls pulsed harder, almost shuddering.

I blacked out.

When I woke up, I was in bed. Morning light filtering through the curtains. Everything normal again. The furniture in its place.

For a while, I convinced myself it had been a nightmare.

Until I saw the note on my dresser. My mother’s handwriting.

*“Don’t leave again. The house gets lonely.”*

The note was written on wallpaper, wallpaper that matched the basement.

I’ve tried leaving. I’ve *tried.*

Every time I pack my bags, something goes wrong. The tires deflate. The front door locks itself. My phone refuses to dial anyone but *“Mom.”*

And she answers.

Sometimes I hear her humming through the vents at night, the same lullaby she sang when I was small. Sometimes I smell that lavender perfume, and the walls ripple softly, as if pleased.

I think the house is keeping me safe.

No...

I think it’s keeping me.

Because last night, I dreamt of that white door again. I could hear breathing on the other side, slow, steady, in sync with mine.

When I woke up, there was a new door in the hallway. This one red. Wet. Waiting.

I think it wants to make me part of it.

Maybe that’s what happened to her.

Maybe that’s why the house always felt alive.

If anyone reading this knows anything about old homes, foundations that shift, blueprints that don’t stay consistent, please tell me if this is possible. Tell me there’s a reason.

Because I looked up property records.

This house has stood here since 1913. It’s been sold sixteen times. Every owner listed as “deceased on property.”

But there’s one detail that makes my skin crawl.

Each record lists a different floor plan.

And the most recent one, the one dated this year, has a new room added.

A bedroom.

I am terrified of hitting 300 pounds. I have shifted my diet over the past 6 months (no eating out, 1 coffee a day, no soda, my meals are usually veggies + fish + quinoa) and despite the diet change ive gained 5 pounds since November. 


Ive come to the conclusion that the weight gain is because of my sedentary life style. I work in an office so I am sitting all day. I usually do over time so from 8AM-8AM I'm sitting down. I cannot request a standing desk (already tried). If you guys could please offer tips and advice to help i would greatly appreciate it. I dont want to get on oz***pic, which is what my doctor suggested me when i brought this issue up to her. 

I dont like going to the gym but I like doing yoga and small in home work outs when I have the time, which is usually on weekends since I only have 3 hours of personal time when I get off work. ",0,1769027129.0,WeightLossAdvice,29,0.5,False

1qj93fm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qj93fm,A Few of My Favorites,"I love many of my older cookbooks for the nostalgia value. This set of 3 volumes from 1944 are epic! From the illustrations, to the menu ideas, to the recipe ingredients, this set offers insight into the era. I never considered just how much mass produced food was available 80 years ago. It raised my eyebrows to see mention of canned soups, evaporated milk and American cheese.

""Sunset's Kitchen Cabinet Recipes"" is a three-volume cookbook series published by Lane Publishing Company in the mid-20th century. Recipes were compiled and edited by the staff of Sunset Magazine. A notable contributor was Genevieve Anne Callahan, who was a food specialist from Better Homes and Gardens and joined Sunset's Los Angeles team. The cookbooks also featured recipes contributed by readers, reflecting the culinary trends of that time in Western America.

Each volume covers a specific period: Volume One spans 1928 to 1933, Volume Two covers 1934 to 1938, and Volume Three includes recipes from 1939 to 1943. These cookbooks feature period-specific illustrations. 

I hope you enjoy the pictures.

This one has been in progress for the last 3 months. It's the largest release yet (hence the double issue), with 84 pages of articles, essays and photos from a wide variety of contributors. It's also the first issue with perfect binding.

I'll work to get copies out to staytruecycles, laureloakland, understoryshop, and watersideworkshops asap. Just dropped copies off at Tip Top in North Oakland.

This one covers: the botany of Tunnel Road, why bike shops fail, adaptive trikes for riders with disabilities, gravel bike suspension, political engagement for cyclists, the giant fish puppet at Bike Party, the final AIDS/LifeCycle, coffee origins and brewing tips, pedicab life in SF, and data visualizations of Oakland's weird topography.
