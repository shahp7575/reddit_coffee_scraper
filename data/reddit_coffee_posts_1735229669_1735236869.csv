Met him about a month ago at work, I‚Äôm in PA school in New York but working part time at a wine bar that I live above to make some extra money. There‚Äôs a coffee shop connected to the bar and the guy that owns it has become my new love interest. I‚Äôm 26, turning 27 next month, and will be a PA in the next six months. I‚Äôm originally from Oregon but living in nyc has been my dream and I have no intent of leaving.

Anyway, I haven‚Äôt been in a serious relationship for three years now. My last one was pretty traumatizing and abusive. After lots of therapy and getting on an SSRI, I finally feel like myself again.

This is the first new crush I‚Äôve had in a while, I think he‚Äôs 29 or 30 and seeing him always makes my day. He remembers everything about me and makes an effort to talk to me whenever I‚Äôm working. I‚Äôve only spoken to him a handful of times just because I‚Äôm so busy, but I‚Äôm definitely interested in getting to know him better. He also considered going to PA school before founding his coffee company, and lived in the same borough as I did in Brooklyn.

I‚Äôm not afraid of rejection and I‚Äôve made the first move many times before. What do you guys think? I think he‚Äôs into me so it‚Äôs likely he‚Äôll ask me out at some point, I‚Äôm just a proactive person lol. Thanks a billion hehe

So, I got diagnosed late November with CIN3 and had my cone surgery on Friday early morning. The only thing my doctor said to me is no bikes, horses, baths, sex and tampons for next 2 weeks, and that's all, so I was not prepared for what is gonna happen afterwards. 

Later that day I got strange discharge out, and started bleeding with bright red blood. Not too much, but I would change 2 regular pads per day, and I was bleeding like this until today. 

Today I got some weird coffee-like discharge, and started bleeding a lot. Like, a pad per hour, which freaked me out bcs I got a bit feverish(my temperature raised to 37.5), and I started feeling a bit unwell. 

I tried to call to emergency service, since both my GP and OBGYN are off until New Years, and the nurse just kept calling me back every hour for the past 3 hours asking if I changed the pad and how is the bleeding. I tried to argue with her that I want the professional to see it(at this point I got cranky since I also got heavy cramps). Her last argument was that it was probably a scab tissue or my period or both, so I should contact my GP tomorrow morning, or whoever substitutes my doctor during the holidays, since she believes the bleeding will stop once I go to bed and sleep. 

It made me cry, bcs I felt like I literally had to argue and fight for my health with her, like she believes I don't know what my period looks and feels like?! And also doctors did not explain to me what is actually normal and what is not after the operation. It's all so sad and frustrating. 



My bleeding did reduce a bit for now, but every time I pee the toilet looks like a crime scene from a horror movie with all the blood passing, and it freaks me out a bit. 

Is there someone with similar experience of constant bleeding after the cone surgery? For how long did it last for you? ",1,1735236204.0,PreCervicalCancer,0,1.0,False

1hmtwxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfreliance/comments/1hmtwxn/article_stay_safe_in_the_extreme_cold/,[Article] Stay Safe in the Extreme Cold,"Exposure to cold can cause frostbite or hypothermia and become life-threatening. Infants and elderly people are most susceptible. What constitutes extreme cold varies in different parts of the country. In the southern U. S., near freezing temperatures are considered extreme cold. Freezing temperatures can cause severe damage to citrus fruit crops and other vegetation. Pipes may freeze and burst in homes that are poorly insulated or without heat. Here in the north, extreme cold means temperatures well below zero.¬†¬†

¬†

**Wind Chill**

*Wind Chill* is the term used to describe the rate of heat loss on the human body resulting from the combined effect of low temperature and wind. As winds increase, heat is carried away from the body at a faster rate, driving down both the skin temperature and eventually the internal body temperature.¬†Animals are also affected by wind chill; however, cars, plants and other objects are not.

¬†

**Frostbite**

Frostbite is damage to body tissue caused by extreme cold. A wind chill of -20¬∞ Fahrenheit (F) will cause frostbite in just 30 minutes. Frostbite causes a loss of feeling and a white or pale appearance in extremities, such as fingers, toes, ear lobes or the tip of the nose. If symptoms are detected, get medical help immediately! If you must wait for help, slowly rewarm affected areas. However, if the person is also showing signs of hypothermia, warm the body core before the extremities.

¬†

**Hypothermia**

Hypothermia is a condition brought on when the body temperature drops to less than 95¬∞F. It can kill. For those who survive, there are likely to be lasting kidney, liver and pancreas problems. Warning signs include uncontrollable shivering, memory loss, disorientation, incoherence, slurred speech, drowsiness and apparent exhaustion. Take the person‚Äôs temperature. If below 95¬∞F, seek medical care immediately!

If medical care is not available, warm the person slowly, starting with the body core. Warming the arms and legs first drives cold blood toward the heart and can lead to heart failure. If necessary, use your body heat to help. Get the person into dry clothing and wrap in a warm blanket covering the head and neck. Do not give the person alcohol, drugs, coffee or any hot beverage or food. Warm broth is the first food to offer. Click this link for more information:¬†[https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/winter/staysafe/hypothermia.html](https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/winter/staysafe/hypothermia.html)

¬†

**Dress For The Cold:**  
Wear layers of loose-fitting and lightweight clothing. Trapped air between the layers will insulate you.

* If doing strenuous outdoor activities, avoid wearing cotton.¬† Once wet, cotton takes a long time to dry and will sap your heat. Use synthetic fabrics that wick moisture from your skin and dry quickly.
* Outer garments should be tightly woven, water repellent, and hooded.
* Wear a hat, because 40%of your body heat can be lost from your head.
* Cover your mouth to protect your lungs from extreme cold.
* Mittens, snug at the wrist, are better than gloves.
* Try to stay dry and out of the wind.

¬†

**When Traveling:**  
**Always prepare for the worst!**¬†

* Your vehicle's winter survival kit should include warm clothes, boots, blankets, flashlight with extra batteries, candy bars or cereal bars.¬† Here is a good list from [ReadyWisconsin](https://readywisconsin.wi.gov/make-a-kit/kits-for-your-car/).
* Always carry a charged cell phone and tell others of your travel plans.

1hmtuzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hmtuzz/lf_rec_alternative_to_bambino_plush_500700_cad/,LF Rec: Alternative to Bambino Plush [~$500-$700 CAD],"Hi everyone!

TLDR: 
- Looking for a recommendation for a first semi-automatic machine that's not a Bambino Plus. Preferably not a Breville. 
- In Canada.
- Will also need to buy the accessories needed for an espresso machine, including a df54. I mention this because it factors into how much I'm willing to spend on the machine itself. 

So I'm looking for my first machine. I have a good amount of coffee experience. I don't mind learning to dial in, or modding, and value it as part of learning experience, but won't be able to mod right away. I'd prefer to not go with a Breville machine. I'd rather something that will last longer and retains its value over time. (That being said, if someone told me the best answer is a Breville... okay.) 

I've done a lot of research on possibilities but am more confused than ever given what most big YouTubers qualify as a good quality machine. Temperature control issues, poor quality parts, pre-infusion capability... oof. Prices in Canada seem to go from $500 for something that has questionable quality, right away to $1,500, with very little in between. 

I just want something that is one step up from a Bambino plus so that I don't need to change setups in a year or two. A step up could mean better parts, better features, or both. Something that I can still play with a year from now since coffee is a hobby. 

Is the answer the Apex V2? is the QC on that any good or am I hedging my bets because it's too soon to tell? Is the answer a Gaggia Classic Evo Plus? Will that pull good shots as is, or will I need to immediately mod it with things like a PID sensor? Is the base model Silvia worth it if I can find it in Canada? Do I spend a ton more money than I want and get into the $1500+ price point with Profitex Go?  An Ascado Steel Duo PID? 

I'd love any help but would especially love to hear from other Canadians that know how expensive everything is here. Plus there may be online shops here I don't know of.

My case was pretty significant as they found and addressed five arterial compressions and two veins that were sacrificed. I‚Äôm really struggling with pain 3+ weeks out. I know things take time to calm down and pain to subside‚Ä¶ weeks and months for some people. I also know post MVD anxiety is a thing, but I can‚Äôt help but think that something isn‚Äôt right. This pain is nearly unbearable. 

While I no longer have pounding pain or TN1 shocks, I have a constant and major headache on the right side + some numbness on my tongue and lower cheek. The pain is so bad that it keeps me up at night and makes me nauseous (slight vertigo, but not throwing up). I‚Äôm tired and don‚Äôt have the energy to do much. 

It‚Äôs like my TN2 pain that I had before surgery x100. My jaw is weak and muscles are very sore/tender. While the skull/incision pain behind my ear is improving, the headaches and TN pain has been this way since the moment I woke up from surgery. Alternating Ibuprofen and Tylenol, but they don‚Äôt help much. Recently (last few days), I have been experiencing really intense pain surrounding my right eye. 

Other things to note: 
- Headache is worse when slightly bending over or moving my head too fast. It is not relieved by lying down. 
- It‚Äôs definitely worse in the mornings and gets *slightly* better as the day progresses. 
- Coffee/caffeine seem to help. 
- No signs of a CSF leak.
- For the first two weeks, I heard a constant clicking in my ear with every heartbeat. That has subsided. 
- When I *very gently* massage around incision, I hear crackling sounds from skull.

I have this problem that I sometimes start crying when he tells me about something and I realise I didn't know that (e.g. something about philosophy). Childhood trauma lets me think that I have to be smart and know everything to be loved (working on  that already...).

This thing is usually only triggered within relationships and in this one, it is very extreme (also because he loves to talk about nerdy things for a long time and, when I try to say something about a topic I am knowledgeable in, such as renewable energies, he does not really listen). 

Anyways, we attended a conference on energy transition (my PhD topic) and I asked three questions to the panel. In the coffee-break he approached me and said: ""Three questions; you are trying to appear smart? Perhaps, you are smart even?"" This hurt so much, like a knife hit my chest. I had to go to the restroom and cry for a bit. After the second panel, I asked another question to the panel and he texted me ""You are holding a lecture..."". This hurt so much but this time, also made me mad, because, typically, it is him who is taking the space to talk about smart things and doesn't care, if the ""audience"" enjoys...

After that incident, we had a serious conversation. Many others signs made me think he was a narcissist. When I told him that, he admitted, that it might be true and that he had the same issues with his first relationship. He admitted he wanted to hurt me during the conference because he was annoyed by the fact that he knows that I actually do not read books (according to him), that I feel stupid and that, based on my questions, everybody is ""deceived"" thinking I am (and feel) smart.

During the conversation, he dropped many other things that really disturbed me such as, that sex was the center of the relationship to him (he was surprised I did not notice that), that he sometimes felt bored because sometimes I was apathic, that he likes people who are passionate and I do not seem to have interest nor passion (because I do not like to watch movies with him all the time; because I am not acting super interested in what he has to say saying ""whoa, I did not know that, tell me more!"" but, on the contrary, sometimes start to cry; etc.). 

Some other red flags are that I noticed him checking my phone (when I asked him what he was doing he said, he wanted to see, whether I was writing with other men); he pushed me into sex (by repeatedly asking, until I gave in - even though I warned him that it will kill by mood in the future; that his acting is egocentric and I do not like that, etc). He even said he doesn't see a future with me if I do not read... 

Anyways... I almost broke up after this because my trust in him and the faith in a future was gone. But then he texted that he thought that I was the ""most intelligent and interesting person he met"" and wants another chance, wants to work on his issues, and so on. I think, I am only hesitant because a small part within me thinks that maybe he just has a very low self-esteem and has to prove something. What are your thoughts; has the ""red line"" been crossed or should I give him another chance?

TL:DR: I almost broke up with my partner after he repeatedly undermined my confidence and belittled my contributions at a professional event, but now he wants another chance, leaving me torn.",1,1735235459.0,relationships,11,0.6,False

\-Build Quality  
Both of them are made of almost fully plastic, while the XM4 have this metal on the headband adjustment, I think the XM5 are fully made of plastic, besides that, the XM5 have the famous hinge flaw, something I havent heard it on the XM4, so if you want the XM5 you should consider this, because you would have to give them extra care to keep them in one piece.

Winner : WH-1000XM4

\-Comfort  
I feel both of them trap a little bit my ears more that I would want to, the XM4 makes my ears hotter than the XM5 do, and I also feel the XM4 trap my ears a little bit more than the XM5, while the XM5 have a more tight headband, so it might get uncomfortable after some hours, both of them have some issues for me for long period times, but I would say I feel better with the XM5.

Winner : WH-1000XM5 (Subjective)

\-Microphone  
XM5 clears here, one of the worst things on the XM4 was their mic quality, they just dont meet the expectations for the brand and price, considering the XM4 was their more important model for the public for 2 years (2020-2022), here, the XM5 improved A LOT, making a good in quiet places, but in noisy places i just shines, outperforms my QC Ultra and Momentum 4 by a step or two.

Winner : WH-1000XM5

\-Battery Life  
Both of them claims to have 30h of battery when ANC On and 38h-40h with ANC off, for my usage (High volume, Anc on) I found them to be pretty similar, tho the XM5 might have an hour or 2 hours of extra battery comparing them to the XM4 its almost the same, and you wont notice unless you count the time when you are using them.

Tie : WH-1000XM5 / WH-1000XM4

\-Sound Quality  
Both of them are bass heavy headphones and targeted for the public, the XM4 have a 40mm driver, so they have more bass than XM5, and you will feel a difference, tho it isnt HUGEEEE, if the XM4 are 5/5 of bass quantity, the XM5 are a 3/5, that being said, the XM4 have a decent clarity and instrument separation, but it can get muddy because of their bass, while the XM5 have less bass, again, not a HUGE difference, they have slightly better clarity due their less bass and their 30mm drivers, so if you are searching for Bass and a decent clarity you would want to go for the XM4, if you are searching for a good thumpy bass, but more controled and a slightly better clarity, you would want to go for the XM5, keep in mind they have a 5 band eq in the Sony app, so you can get them to sound to your liking if you arent satisfied, if we are talking objectivly the XM5 are supposed to be better by a small margin, but for my liking I would take the XM4 due their more bass heavy sound, but I went for the XM5 because I already have a momentum 4 that can get pretty bass heavy with eq, so I wanted to try something different, and went for the XM5, and I am totally satisfied with their sound, tho not as good as Sennheiser imo, but I have nothing to regret.

Winner : WH-1000XM4 (Subjective)

\-ANC  
I tested them both with a simulation of a coffee, office, mall and inside a plane on my TV, in the plane simulation and in the mall simulation I couldnt tell an actual difference between them, both cancelled like 85% of the plane engine noise and on the mall both cancelled pretty well ambient chatter and kids screaming, etc.  
While in the coffee and office simulation I could tell the XM5 were better, not that far but not that close, they cancell more high frecuency noises like phones ringing, forks noises, plates noises, etc, while both still made a good job on cancelling ambient chatter, the XM5 took the lead in those noises, I didnt feel a game changing difference between these two, tho the XM5 are better by a small difference, they are better, but the XM4 still holds pretty strong.

Winner : WH-1000XM5

\-Transparency  
Just like the Mic Quality, the XM5 took a clear lead here, the XM4 sounded a lot more muffled and robotic comparing to the XM5 transparency, they did a BIG better job here with the XM5 comparing to the XM4 and their mediocre transparency.

Winner : WH-1000XM5

\-Case  
The XM4 clearly wins here, due their ability to fold, something that the XM5 cant do, so the XM4 case will be smaller than the XM5, tho I didnt find them to make a HUGE difference for my day to day, the XM4 are deffinetely more smaller than the XM5, so if you are a traveler you would want to go for XM4, both of them are hard cases that protect completely your headphones, did you heard that Apple?

Winner : WH-1000XM4

Both of them are top class ANC headphones for their price range, both of them have their differences, strengths and weaknesses, and depending on what you are looking for, you will lean for one or another, I went for the XM5 because they are better overall and it was just a $60 difference from the XM4, the only thing I would wanted was that more bass heavy sound of the XM4, but since I already can get that with my Momentum 4, I went for the XM5 and im not regreting it at all, tho if its a more than a $100 difference I would consider going for the XM4, so you would also have to check how much they are in your country.

Thats all, hope I helped with my review and happy holidays yall!

It's not a chapter book, more like a read aloud picture book. It has gorgeous illustrations (described more below). I had it in a hard cover.

Era: I read it in the late 1990s/early 2000s, but it could be older (wouldn't be surprised if it was from anywhere between 1960-1980).

Setting: Scandinavian, wintry, cozy/hygge vibes. Not in the countryside, always kind of have Stockholm vibes to me. 

Plot: A granddaughter and her grandmother (who I think I remember went by Mormor) go about their day. They have coffee at home, shake out their blankets/duvets in the cold air, visit a fish market and end up at a Christmas party. I vaguely remember fishing trucks driving out on the ice at the market, and a train being near the party they go to. 

Visuals: Beautiful illustrations, potentially hand-drawn or painterly.

We‚Äôre both in our late 20s, and we meet up pretty regularly in person. I‚Äôve met her family and friends, and honestly, her family is amazing‚Äîsuper sweet people. The chemistry between us is insane. The sex? Incredible. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been more attracted to anyone. She‚Äôs tatted, educated, fit, and just has so many qualities I love.

But here‚Äôs where the issues come in:

Money ‚Äì I‚Äôm an accountant, and I treat my personal finances like a well-run business. I‚Äôm debt-free, but she‚Äôs got a ton of student debt. The good news is she‚Äôs been meeting me halfway. I‚Äôve set up coffee dates to talk money, we keep the convo focused with a timer and talking points, and she‚Äôs been open to working on a plan to eliminate the debt. That‚Äôs progress, but it‚Äôs still something that weighs on me.

Where we‚Äôll live ‚Äì She wants to settle in a high cost of living (HCOL) area in the Northeast, but I‚Äôd rather live closer to her family in the same state. It‚Äôs warmer and would make regular trips to see her family much easier, which I think would be great.

Introvert vs. extrovert ‚Äì I feel like we don‚Äôt connect as much as I‚Äôd like because we don‚Äôt talk often. I‚Äôm the type who values communication a lot, while she‚Äôs more introverted and just likes to chill, which I‚Äôm fine with‚Äîespecially since she‚Äôs super stressed during the semester. But it still leaves me feeling a little disconnected sometimes.

So, AITAH for thinking about breaking up with her? She‚Äôs genuinely amazing‚Äîher family is great, the attraction is off the charts, and I really admire her drive and career goals. We‚Äôve got plans to move in together in 18 months, and I‚Äôve already set aside money for the ring and honeymoon. I‚Äôve also started investing for a fat down payment on a house because we plan to buy in 12‚Äì15 years after clearing the debt.

The mansion is over 14,000 square feet, and sits on 20 acres of immaculate grounds, 45 minutes outside of Nashville, Tennessee. If not an American citizen, you get a provisional American Magical Residency card, which allows you to live and work in America. You have exclusive use of one master en-suite bedroom and another smaller en-suite bedroom, but the rest of the spaces are shared with several roommates. You have one designated garage parking spot, and another in the driveway. 

You do not own the house, you just have the right to live in it, including any spouse and children. You may not rent out, sublet, or profit in anyway from your interest in the house. Utilities are covered. But landscaping, pool maintenance, housekeeping, etc., must all be done by, or paid by the residents, including you or your roommates. So you can do the work yourself, pay to hire someone, or try to get the roommates to do the same. It is up to you to figure out how to best live and get along with your roommates, while taking care of the home. 

If you are away from the house for more than three weeks, you forfeit your right to live there, unless your absence is due to medical necessity. 

Your roommates:

Randy Mario Poffo, aka Macho Man Randy Savage. Randy is stuck in a time warp, always feeling like he is living from September 7 - 14, 1987, having just won the third annual WWF King of the Ring. He won‚Äôt age, and at the end of every week he forgets everything from the past week and starts over on September 7. He will not be able to be convinced he is in a time warp, or anything is awry. 

Randy will throw a party every Thursday night. He will have guests who he thinks are other famous wrestlers, but who are, in fact, bad impersonators. No matter how much you explain this or point to obvious evidence, he will believe the guests are his famous friends. 

Randy doesn‚Äôt mind mowing the yard, but doesn‚Äôt clean otherwise, and spends most of his money on his parties and steroids. If you leave leftovers in the fridge, even like a half-eaten burger, he will probably eat it. 

Goody (Ann) Putnam, from The Crucible. Goodwife Putnam, was a housewife in Salem, and is a religious zealot. Having come directly from 17th century New England, she is frightened and confused by our world, and rarely leaves the house, except to collect her monthly ‚ÄúFictional Character Lost in Time‚Äù assistance stipend provided by the Hypothetical Situation Council. Unlike Randy, she can experience time and change, though she also does not age. However, as ahe believes nearly everything in our modern world is of the devil, and witchcraft, it may be quite difficult to get her to change. 

She spends most of her free time studying the Bible, and will try to busy herself with productive tasks otherwise. She will judge pretty much everything you do, and will likely try to report your sins to the closest church. She can work tirelessly, but will refuse to help clean up after sinful activities like parties, coffee, or anything that would support what she views as evil. 

Santa Claus. Santa doesn‚Äôt live with you full time, but is there most of the time from January through August. When he returns to the North Pole. Mrs. Claus rarely shows up at the mansion, she prefers the cold of the Arctic. But Santa has a girlfriend, Tammy, who shows up pretty often when he is around. She is 49, has bleached blonde hair, drinks bud ice and smokes like a chimney. When it is warm, Tammy may sunbathe topless at the pool, without shame. Her skin is leathery and her breasts pendulous. 

On the rare occasion Mrs. Claus shows up, Santa will expect you to cover for him regarding Tammy. Failure to do so means you will never get Christmas presents again, and will have to deal with a surly roommate. 

Despite the fact that Santa is wealthy, he will be loathe to spend any additional money on upkeep of the mansion. As the CEO of the largest magical manufacturing and logistics corporation in the world, he is used to giving orders, and not used to doing any chores himself.  Tammy might clean up the kitchen if she is visiting, but only when she is sober. Tammy has a pet Iguana, which she brings with her when she visits. 

Marcia Clark. The famed Assistant DA who co-prosecuted the OJ Simpson murder trial, she is also stuck in a time warp, from January 24 through October 3, 1995. She will believe she is in the trial, and will leave every weekday to go to a room provided by the Hypothetical Situation Council, where she will act out and experience that day‚Äôs portion of the trial. When she reaches the end of the trial, the last several months are wiped out and she starts fresh. 

She will be unable to understand that she is not in the 1995 trial. If you try to show her tapes or transcripts of the trial, she will be unable to process them. You can, however, provide helpful advice and support, as long as it seems to her that it comes from a legitimate place. 

Because of the trial, she is very stressed, and has little time for anything else besides preparation, though she may unwind with a little wine on the weekend of during the few periods where the trial was in recess. She will be VERY annoyed with Macho Man‚Äôs parties. She is willing to contribute $100 per week toward cleaning, landscaping, etc., but may stop paying if she feels everyone is not paying their fair share. Marcia has four cats.

I saw how I struggled from the beginning to the end of a 2-year relationship. I can now say that leaving that relationship was the best decision I‚Äôve ever made for myself.

In October 2022, I posted, 

*‚Äúbare minimum. I mean, he's a great bf. not perfect, but I would say the best you can ever ask for. I know I'm not a perfect gf as well.‚Äù*

 I convinced myself that I had everything I needed. But as much as I told myself that, I felt something was always missing.

*""I'm happy and contented in this rs. so ang hirap magreklamo, hirap din naman mag hangad, no room din naman for demand. he's a decent bf. he doesn't cheat or lie. will spend time with you, but that's it. The best trait about him is the things that you SHOULD do when you're in a relationship, you just have to accept the fact na you'll never get random acts of love unlike some girlfriends.""* 

I told myself to be grateful. He wasn't perfect, but I tried to believe that I was lucky to have him, even though deep down I knew I was suppressing my real desires.

Then I went on to say, *""ik na I'll never find anyone like him, and ik na he loves me very much, I won't ever trade him for the world. bb is so fckn cute and adorable.""* 

I felt guilty for even questioning my relationship, but it was hard not to feel conflicted.

*‚ÄúBut i will never get sick of this rs and i will do my very best to keep it. at the same time, deep down i know every girl wants to be treated like as such. im fucking conflicted.‚Äù* 

I was torn. I knew I was loved, but I wasn‚Äôt getting the kind of love I had always dreamed of. And I couldn‚Äôt ignore it any longer.

The mere fact that I had to create that account as an outlet was already a sign that I was unhappy, because imagine being unable to feel safe enough to communicate your thoughts with your partner.

That relationship kept me questioning what I deserved, but I can say now with certainty that I didn‚Äôt deserve to feel stuck. Leaving was the hardest yet best decision for me. And now, I have someone who truly values me for who I am.

I now have a man who loves me for who I am‚Äîa man I can be comfortable with and be myself around. He doesn‚Äôt pressure me at all and lets me do things at my own pace. Langga is my peace.

He makes me want to be better, not out of obligation, but out of inspiration. He doesn't push me or make me feel like I'm not enough‚Äîhe just loves me for exactly who I am. He supports my dreams, and makes me feel heard.

Today, he surprised me with coffee and gifts bursting out of my office locker‚Äîsomething I never imagined I would get to experience. I immediately got emotional. He gave me my first ever bracelet, and stuff from my favorite stores -- although it might seem like a simple Christmas gift to him, it means the world to me. 

He sacrificed his time and sleep, showing me that ‚Äúif he wanted to, he would.‚Äù 

The way he treats me proves that love is never about making excuses‚Äîit‚Äôs about making effort and showing up.

1hmth2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/FermentationScience/comments/1hmth2n/research_coffee_and_gut_health/,Research:  Coffee And Gut Health,"This sub was not only established to discuss fermentation outside the gut, but also inside of the gut.

Nature is one of the big three research pubs.  

Nature recently published an interesting article ""[Coffee consumption is associated with intestinal Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus abundance and prevalence across multiple cohorts.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01858-9)""

The research starts by acknowledging the well-established health benefits of coffee, including reduced risk of:

* All-cause and cardiovascular mortality
* Type 2 diabetes
* Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
* Cancer

In 2018, researchers found out Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus (or LA): a species residing in the human gut, identified as strongly associated with coffee consumption in this study.  It looks like coffee drinker (not caffeine) has levels some 4x higher than non-coffee drinkers.  (LA is one of the internal fermentation sources...)

Why might you want this?  What does this species do?

Increases hippurate levels: People with LA in their gut microbiome have higher levels of hippurate, which is a marker of gut and metabolic health. 

Increases microbiome diversity: Coffee drinkers tend to have higher microbiome diversity, which may be due to the nutrients in coffee, such as polyphenols and soluble fiber.

Linked to healthier blood sugar and fat responses: LA may be linked to healthier blood sugar and fat responses after eating.

Linked to higher insulin sensitivity: LA may be linked to higher insulin sensitivity.

Linked to lower levels of insulin secretion: LA may be linked to lower levels of insulin secretion.

  
This may be tied to coffee's quinic acid.  I'll let you read the article, but basically the thought is that coffee helps in the use and formation of quinic acid.

With that written and I've written about this before, the human biome is very complex and we don't exactly how it all fits together.  However, the research for coffee intake seems to be very high.

I've never like coffee, but finally the research got so large that I put it into my diet.  My wif didn't take because I did use it.  However, she started once I did.  Interestingly, she adapted pretty well, and can drink it black.

I still need sugar and milk, but it makes it almost enjoyable.  Reguardless, if I can switch, I think anyboy can.

Is it a residual symptom of MDD/GAD/ADHD ? Something else that's undiagnosed ? ,"Disclaimer I sent an e-mail about this to my psychiatrist-obviously it's the holidays so it'll take some time for him to get back to me. 

28M

Medications : 40mg ritalin modified release and 15mg Trintellix in the morning when I wake-up

Non pharm substances : 1 coffee in the morning, vape

Psychotherapy : CBT, Yes, though like all therapists I've seen, there is 0 structure and it's just me talking and them giving half-assed advice (and never telling me HOW to do what I need to do even when they give me advice). Yes this is an accurate assessment of my therapy experience. My psychiatrist said he'd call my psychologist to see if he can arrange a more structured/semi-structured therapy experience. 

Diagnoses : ADHD, MDD, GAD

I'm just so scared it'll stay like this forever. 

I've tried numerous meds with little to no success for this. I'm so exhausted by this. 

Every thing I do is procrastinated (while feeling like shit and anxious) because everything that I do, is connected to so many other things I need to and when I do it, I feel mentally exhausted because I have all these other things going on in my brain at the same time. 

It's like everything because one giant amorphous task and when I split it into smaller tasks it becomes even more overwhelming cause it's so much. 

Everything takes so much energy, is so boring, is so exhausting mentally. 

It's crazy cause I've been doing better mood wise since brintellix, but it's almost like the better I do with MDD, the worse my anxiety cause I can finally want to do stuff but I can't DO stuff cause I'm overwhelmed. 

This has absolutely been crushing my QoL. It's gotten so much worse when I started living alone, and never got better (3 years now). 

It's a constant battle. More exposure to the tasks doesn't help. Every time I try, it's like it's the first time for my brain and everything becomes a mess. Or everytime my brain will act like the task is litteral torture when we've brushed my teeth ten thousand times and while it is torture in a way, it's not the end of the world. Why tf am I like this ?

I don't know how much longer I can live like this. I'm 28 and in so much shame (in part) because I can't have a basic normal life. Never had a job, failed my studies a bunch of times (and will likely fail again if this goes on, which is even more stressfull cause this year's my last chance at higher education-long story), I'm on social security. I'm so tired of being a leech to society. I just want to be productive and live a decent life and make something of myself. 


I swear every day I wake up and try and try again. I'm so afraid of not accomplishing anything, becoming homeless (for complicated socio-cultural reasons, I can't depend on family/friends). I'm on my own. I need to function or I'll suffer forever. 

I don't know what's wrong with me. Like why can't I do basic things ? 

I feel so much shame, guilt, anxiety about my future at this pace, loneliness, etc. 

I just want to breathe ffs. I don't know if the issue is a change in meds/dose, therapy approach, lifestyle, etc. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I'm so lost.

1hmt8ln,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1hmt8ln/horrible_workplace_environment_story/,Horrible Workplace Environment Story,"Hi everyone, I have a story about a recent experience at my work. One of many. Enjoy.

# Part 1:

I work remotely for a UK Law firm providing legal services to insurance companies. As a basic description, let's say for example you have a car crash. After you report the crash to your insurance agency, your insurance agency will contact their legal services and provide, ""instructions"", details on the accident and the client. We will then setup the client's file on our system and pursue the third party and their insurance for compensation.

I work for this law firm through an offshoring company. The offshoring company provides the office space, equipment, networking and support we need. They also provide us with a laptop to work from home. Well most of the time we get to work from home. Our client, the unnamed law firm, requires offshore employees to work in the office two days a week. Why do we have to come to the office to work remotely twice a week? I don't know. One of the many mysteries of working for this company. Anyway.

Just for clarification, I work in Administration. So unlike most teams that deal with clients directly and are assigned a specific case load, I receive specific tasks through emails. These tasks can be to setup new files, submit files on the various UK Government portals, instructing Medical Agencies to arrange appointments for the clients etc. I work 9 to 5 most days.

One day, while working from home, I wake up and login to over 10 emails. Most of them are details to setup new files and a few requests from other teams on specific files. So I decide I am going to get through all my emails so I can go and make coffee. Crucial detail, this day was the last day to complete internal training for the offshoring company. Just a few videos and refresher questions about GDPR and data protection, which I completed the day before. About 40 minutes into working, I apparently got a phone call from my team leader on my personal phone through Whatsapp to ask if I had completed the training due COB that day.

* **Side note:** I don't keep my phone with me. I've been trying to minimize all phone usage as much as possible and have deleted all social media. I only use my phone for private conversations on Whatsapp and to login to different accounts. Which I think is pretty reasonable. No company or device should be able to hold anyone hostage and exploit them for all their time in order to profiteer off of their data. I am not a slave big tech. So I say apparently because I was unaware.

09:43 The first Whatsapp phone call

* My phone is on silent and behind me on a table. So I obviously don't answer. I'm doing my work. Why would I answer someone on my personal device during working hours? Besides, it's not like we use Microsoft Teams and Outlook for internal communications (We do...)

09:45 Team leader attempts to contact me on Microsoft teams. No answer

09:47 The second Whatsapp phone call

09:53 I receive an email from my Team leader, who included the line manager in the cc

Initiating a no contact procedure with a multi paragraph wall of text berating me, stating that all employees should be reachable when working from home and that we should have a coaching session about this. The wording of the email made me extremely annoyed as it purposefully misrepresented me to the line manager and made it seem as if I was purposefully ignore calls and refusing to get in contact with my team leader. Which is absolutely not true. She's just an idiot.

Now, on all of our profiles, Microsoft Teams is disabled from starting automatically. So you have to manually open Teams to receive calls. My team works almost exclusively by email. So here are my issues with her blatant lies about me.

1. Why would she call me on my personal Whatsapp to speak about work?
2. Why would she count a personal phone call outside of the approved work environment as a no contact?
3. Why would she not first send me an email to arrange a call?
4. Even if she couldn't reach me on teams, had she just sent me a personal message on teams I would have received an email notification stating ""Someone is trying to get a hold of you on Teams"" along with a summery of the message.
5. Why did she not just send me an email asking if it was completed?

Even if she couldn't reach me, why is the assumption automatically ""He is purposefully refusing to answer me"", instead of ""Maybe he is just busy"". Any other Team Leader gives their team members the benefit of the doubt. After all between 09:43 and 09:47 is only 4 minutes. Now I am not a robot. I know. Shockingly, I could have been for example... in the bathroom. I could have been on call with another Team member. I could have been DOING THE FUCKING TRAINING THAT WAS DUE THAT DAY. Which, by the way, team leaders have access to our training profiles.

Had she just used her FUCKING EYES she could have checked if the training was completed before contacting me. In other words, there should have been no reason for the reported no contact because one the training was already complete. Two, even if the training wasn't complete it was due end of day so I still had over 10 hours to do it. Three, contact outside of the work environment should not count towards a no contact and four, why was I not given the benefit of the doubt? Instead in my team, the worst is always assumed of us.

Naturally, I am very irradiated at this point. So I respond to her no contact email, every matter of fact.

>""The training was completed yesterday, I have a million things to get to and did not have my phone with me while I am working. I do not need coaching. Thank you.""

This is where the story gets really fun.

# Part 2:

A few days later the Line Manager arranges a discussion with the department head (Our boss), my team leader and herself, and the HR. I assumed this is due to the no contact and that this was the, ""coaching session"".

So the day comes, I am asked to come in and we all sit down for the, ""coaching session"".

>Line Manager: ""So do you know why we are here today?""

>Me: ""I assume it's due to the alleged no contact""

>Line Manager: ""Yes, why don't you tell us your side""

>Me: ""Well I think my Team Leader should go first so I can get her perspective""

Obviously if I am going to be defending myself I need to know what I am defending myself against.

>Line Manager: ""No, I think you should go first""

So I start explaining that I had already completed the training the day before and, ""I just had a really busy morning and did not have time to respond stating that the training had been done. But rest assured it was complete. All of a sudden I get this no contact email when I wasn't even aware I was being contacted because I don't keep my phone with me and my Teams was not open. But, I'm not sure why it is classified as no contact as here are the reasons why I believe it should not be classified as a no contact, and the possible scenarios that could have occurred that would have prevented me from answering the call in such as short space of time"".

I then went on to list that had I just been contacted through email or messaged on teams I would have immediately responded as I work out of my Outlook mailbox so I am on it 24/7. I listed the possible scenarios that could have prevented me from answering the call including going to the bathroom, been on break (we get 2 10 minute breaks a day by the way), phone call with co workers, emergency situation etc ect.

Now I was getting to the point, which was had I just been given the benefit of the doubt or contacted through the correct channels I would have responded and there would have been no need for a no contact, especially when the requirement that was due was due in over 10 hours.

In the middle of this, the piece of shit interrupts me.

>Department Head: ""No no no no no no you are really starting to irritate me""

>Me: ""But""

>Department Head: ""No stop. YOU ARE REALLY IRRITATING ME NOW. You are looking for all these excusing and if's but's and um's. You're like a worm, wriggling for anything you can latch on to. When someone calls you, you answer!"".

This mother fucker calls me a WORM. In front of HR. I knew from that moment there was literally no argument I could make and the purpose for this entire meeting was not looking for an explanation on my side, but to get me to apologize for not responding in 4 minutes. So someone that is meant to be neutral and objective has chosen to defend someone higher up in his staff WITHOUT HEARING WHAT THEY'VE HAD TO SAY FIRST. Remember, I am still giving my side. Fun fact, she did not say a word or present her side the entire meeting.

>Me: ""But is Whatsapp an approved platform?""

>Department Head: ""NO NO NO YOU ARE REALLY IRRITATING ME NOW. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT POLICIES THAT YOU HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT. IF SOMEONE CALLS YOU ON WHATSAPP YOU ANSWER. I ANSWER MY SUPERIORS WHEN THEY CALL ME.

>Department Head: ""SO I AM WARNING YOU NOW, YOU ARE OUT OF LINE AND THIS IS A WARNING THAT IF YOU CONTINUE SAYING THE THINGS YOU ARE SAYING I WILL BE FORCED TO TAKE THIS MORE SERIOUSLY AND GIVE YOU A VERBAL OR WRITTEN WARNING""

Well that's nice of him. He gave me a pre-warning warning that he was going to give me a warning for asking logical questions. By the way, the most hilarious thing about this situation is that we have a no phone policy. You use your phone to login and nothing else. In fact, the same Department Head regularly walks around the office to see who's on their phones. In fact he's given my teammate multiple warnings and even called her in to discipline her for her phone use in the office. So when it's convenient it's religiously enforced but when it's used against you, it's hand waved and dismissed. Right.

Never mind the fact that the company did not pay for my phone. I did. The company does not pay for my data. I do. The company does not own Whatsapp or Meta. It's a third party platform. So why all of a sudden when we preach, ""Work life balance!"" is my personal property being appropriated for work use? Nowhere in my contract does it state ""When you sign, we own all of you and all your property. Good little slave"".

If there was genuinely no other way to contact me or if the company provided a device for personal communication, different story. So no you can not use my personal device or my personal number to contact me during work hours, outside of official channels on unapproved third party platforms. You will not receive an answer.

>Line Manager: ""So, this meeting is not about the no contact, It's about your email response. You didn't even say Hi in your email to you Team Leader and you just gave her this email with a horrible tone. This is not how you speak to your Team Leader""

YES BECAUSE THE MOTHERFUCKER LIEEEEED TO YOU ABOUT MY CHARACTER AND INSULTED ME WHY THE FUCK WOULD I NOT BE IRRITATED???

So all of a sudden the discussion about the no contact morphed into a discussion about the ""tone"" of my matter of fact email that was not insulting at all. It was just straight to the point. Bearing in mind that is up to the reader to give meaning to words. ""Wow!"" can be read in a tone of amazement but also ""Wow!"" out of sarcasm and disgust. So calling me in for someone else's opinion about the ""tone"" of written words that they misinterpreted is also complete horseshit. But that's what the argument turned into. I can only assume because there was no defense of the original reason. And by the way, most of the time our Team Leader doesn't even say hi to us and we just send emails to each other without the formality.

So without context from my Team Leader, again she never said a word. The Department Head took her side from my story, insulted me by calling me a worm and then gave me a pre-warning warning that I was going to get a warning if I continued to ask questions. He then stated I was asking about policies I knew nothing about... and then proceeded to, instead of clarifying those supposed ""policies"", that don't exist, continued to aggressively warn me about the warning to warn the warning warn. Warning.

So I just stated: ""I can see how it could be misinterpreted and it was never meant to come off that way. So I apologize if it came off as slightly defensive"". The whole situation defused after that and we left. That's all they wanted, some acknowledgement that it could have potentially been seen as offensive. Literally nothing related to the situation at all. Wtf.

# Question:

It wasn't part of the original plans but the structural engineer approved the change so went for it. What we didn't fully think through was how to deal with the existing brick facade now being too short.

One option we're considering is extending the brick since we have some extra that should match that came from a wall demo, but not sure if we have enough or we can get the mortar to match well enough to look seamless. Also there are currently no lintels over the window openings so those would need to be added if we extend the brick up.

Another option would be going with some kind trim or board and batten detail, not sure how that would look, I'm trying to find examples of similar situations but haven't been able to find any.

What would you do here? Happy to offer some digital coffees if we go with your suggestion.

\-Build Quality  
Both of them are made of almost fully plastic, while the XM4 have this metal on the headband adjustment, I think the XM5 are fully made of plastic, besides that, the XM5 have the famous hinge flaw, something I havent heard it on the XM4, so if you want the XM5 you should consider this, because you would have to give them extra care to keep them in one piece.

Winner : WH-1000XM4

\-Comfort  
I feel both of them trap a little bit my ears more that I would want to, the XM4 makes my ears hotter than the XM5 do, and I also feel the XM4 trap my ears a little bit more than the XM5, while the XM5 have a more tight headband, so it might get uncomfortable after some hours, both of them have some issues for me for long period times, but I would say I feel better with the XM5.

Winner : WH-1000XM5 (Subjective)

\-Microphone  
XM5 clears here, one of the worst things on the XM4 was their mic quality, they just dont meet the expectations for the brand and price, considering the XM4 was their more important model for the public for 2 years (2020-2022), here, the XM5 improved A LOT, making a good in quiet places, but in noisy places i just shines, outperforms my QC Ultra and Momentum 4 by a step or two.

Winner : WH-1000XM5

\-Battery Life  
Both of them claims to have 30h of battery when ANC On and 38h-40h with ANC off, for my usage (High volume, Anc on) I found them to be pretty similar, tho the XM5 might have an hour or 2 hours of extra battery comparing them to the XM4 its almost the same, and you wont notice unless you count the time when you are using them.

Tie : WH-1000XM5 / WH-1000XM4

\-Sound Quality  
Both of them are bass heavy headphones and targeted for the public, the XM4 have a 40mm driver, so they have more bass than XM5, and you will feel a difference, tho it isnt HUGEEEE, if the XM4 are 5/5 of bass quantity, the XM5 are a 3/5, that being said, the XM4 have a decent clarity and instrument separation, but it can get muddy because of their bass, while the XM5 have less bass, again, not a HUGE difference, they have slightly better clarity due their less bass and their 30mm drivers, so if you are searching for Bass and a decent clarity you would want to go for the XM4, if you are searching for a good thumpy bass, but more controled and a slightly better clarity, you would want to go for the XM5, keep in mind they have a 5 band eq in the Sony app, so you can get them to sound to your liking if you arent satisfied, if we are talking objectivly the XM5 are supposed to be better by a small margin, but for my liking I would take the XM4 due their more bass heavy sound, but I went for the XM5 because I already have a momentum 4 that can get pretty bass heavy with eq, so I wanted to try something different, and went for the XM5, and I am totally satisfied with their sound, tho not as good as Sennheiser imo, but I have nothing to regret.

Winner : WH-1000XM4 (Subjective)

\-ANC  
I tested them both with a simulation of a coffee, office, mall and inside a plane on my TV, in the plane simulation and in the mall simulation I couldnt tell an actual difference between them, both cancelled like 85% of the plane engine noise and on the mall both cancelled pretty well ambient chatter and kids screaming, etc.  
While in the coffee and office simulation I could tell the XM5 were better, not that far but not that close, they cancell more high frecuency noises like phones ringing, forks noises, plates noises, etc, while both still made a good job on cancelling ambient chatter, the XM5 took the lead in those noises, I didnt feel a game changing difference between these two, tho the XM5 are better by a small difference, they are better, but the XM4 still holds pretty strong.

Winner : WH-1000XM5

\-Transparency  
Just like the Mic Quality, the XM5 took a clear lead here, the XM4 sounded a lot more muffled and robotic comparing to the XM5 transparency, they did a BIG better job here with the XM5 comparing to the XM4 and their mediocre transparency.

Winner : WH-1000XM5

\-Case  
The XM4 clearly wins here, due their ability to fold, something that the XM5 cant do, so the XM4 case will be smaller than the XM5, tho I didnt find them to make a HUGE difference for my day to day, the XM4 are deffinetely more smaller than the XM5, so if you are a traveler you would want to go for XM4, both of them are hard cases that protect completely your headphones, did you heard that Apple?

Winner : WH-1000XM4

Both of them are top class ANC headphones for their price range, both of them have their differences, strengths and weaknesses, and depending on what you are looking for, you will lean for one or another, I went for the XM5 because they are better overall and it was just a $60 difference from the XM4, the only thing I would wanted was that more bass heavy sound of the XM4, but since I already can get that with my Momentum 4, I went for the XM5 and im not regreting it at all, tho if its a more than a $100 difference I would consider going for the XM4, so you would also have to check how much they are in your country.

Thats all, hope I helped with my review and happy holidays yall!

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life. It plays a key role in nearly every bodily function, from regulating body temperature to lubricating joints. So, how much water should you drink each day? The answer varies based on several factors, including your age, gender, activity level, and overall health. Understanding these aspects can help you determine the ideal amount of water for your body.

### General Guidelines

A common recommendation is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, known as the ""8x8 rule."" This equates to about 2 liters or half a gallon. However, this is a baseline guideline and may not apply to everyone. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggests a more tailored approach:

- For men: About 3.7 liters (or 13 cups) of total water intake per day.
- For women: About 2.7 liters (or 9 cups) of total water intake per day.

Total water intake includes all beverages and food consumed. Foods like fruits and vegetables can contribute to your daily water intake as well.

### Factors Influencing Water Needs

Different elements can influence how much water you need, including:

- **Activity Level:** If you exercise or engage in strenuous activities, your body loses more water through sweat, requiring you to drink more.
- **Climate:** Hot or humid weather can increase your need for hydration as your body works harder to cool down.
- **Health Status:** Conditions such as fever, vomiting, or diarrhea can lead to dehydration. On the flip side, some chronic illnesses may necessitate limiting fluid intake.
- **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Women who are pregnant or nursing typically require more fluids to stay hydrated.

### Signs of Dehydration

It‚Äôs important to recognize when your body needs more fluids. Look out for these signs of dehydration:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Dark yellow urine
- Dry mouth and throat
- Fatigue or dizziness
- Headaches
- Dry skin

If you experience these symptoms, it may be an indication that you need to increase your water intake. Always listen to your body's signals and adjust accordingly.

### Health Benefits of Staying Hydrated

Drinking enough water each day comes with numerous health benefits:

- Set reminders on your phone to take a few sips throughout the day.
- Add flavor to your water with slices of fruits like lemon, lime, or berries.
- Eat water-rich foods such as cucumbers, oranges, and melons.
- Drink a glass of water before each meal or snack.

Remember, hydration needs can be highly personal, so it‚Äôs vital to pay attention to your body‚Äôs cues. The amount of water that is right for you may differ from the common recommendations. Adjust your intake based on your lifestyle, climate, and wellness needs. Prioritize drinking enough water each day, as it truly is one of the simplest, yet most impactful, health habits you can adopt.

The Surprising Benefits of Staying Hydrated

Myths and Facts About Daily Water Intake
----------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, yet there are many myths surrounding daily water intake. Understanding the facts can help you optimize your hydration habits. Let's dive deeper into these myths and uncover the truth about how much water you should drink each day.

### Myth 1: You Need to Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day

Many people believe that drinking eight glasses (about 2 liters) of water daily is a strict requirement for everyone. While this is a general guideline, individual needs can vary widely based on factors like age, gender, activity level, and overall health. For instance, active individuals or those living in hotter climates might require more fluid to remain properly hydrated, while sedentary individuals may need less.

### Myth 2: All Fluids Count Toward Your Daily Water Needs

It is commonly thought that as long as you drink fluids, you will stay hydrated. While it‚Äôs true that other drinks‚Äîlike tea, coffee, and even juices‚Äîcontribute to hydration, not all drinks offer the same benefits. Some beverages, such as those high in sugar or caffeine, might lead to dehydration due to their diuretic effects.

### Myth 3: You Should Only Drink When You‚Äôre Thirsty

While thirst is a reliable indicator of your body‚Äôs need for water, it may not always signal dehydration effectively. Sometimes, by the time you feel thirsty, your body may already be slightly dehydrated. It‚Äôs beneficial to drink water consistently throughout the day, rather than waiting for thirst to prompt you.

### Myth 4: Clear Urine Means You‚Äôre Fully Hydrated

Many believe that if their urine is clear, they are adequately hydrated. While clear urine can indicate good hydration, it‚Äôs important to consider other factors too. Certain medical conditions or medications can also affect urine color. A more nuanced approach would be to aim for light yellow urine, which generally indicates proper hydration.

### Health Benefits of Proper Hydration

Adequate water intake has numerous advantages:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Supports Digestion:** Water helps break down food, allowing your body to absorb nutrients effectively.
- **Enhances Physical Performance:** Proper hydration can significantly improve your exercise efficiency. Even mild dehydration can impact your strength and endurance.
- **Boosts Cognitive Function:** Staying hydrated is essential for maintaining concentration and clear thinking. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, confusion, and reduced alertness.
- **Improves Skin Health:** Hydration helps maintain skin elasticity and can contribute to a healthy, glowing complexion.
- **Aids in Weight Management:** Drinking water before meals may help control appetite and reduce overall calorie intake.

### How to Gauge Your Daily Water Intake

Instead of adhering strictly to the eight-glass rule, consider these personalized methods to determine your water needs:

1. **Body Weight:** A common guideline is to drink about half your body weight in ounces. For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, aim for about 80 ounces of water.
2. **Activity Level:** If you exercise frequently, increase your water intake to compensate for fluid loss through sweat.
3. **Climate:** Adjust your fluid intake based on climate. Hot, humid conditions require more hydration.
4. **Diet:** Consider water content in food. Fruits and vegetables contribute to your hydration needs, so if your diet is high in these, you may need less water.

### Practical Tips for Staying Hydrated

Here are some simple strategies to enhance your daily hydration:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Having a refillable water bottle with you can encourage you to drink more throughout the day.
- **Set Reminders:** Use your phone or calendar apps to set hydration reminders every hour.
- **Add Flavor:** If plain water seems boring, try adding slices of lemon, cucumber, or mint leaves for a refreshing twist.
- **Track Your Intake:** Use hydration apps to monitor your daily water consumption and help you stay on track.

Understanding the myths and facts about daily water intake will help you form better hydration habits. Remember that your needs may vary, so listen to your body and adjust accordingly for optimal health.

How Your Activity Level Affects Your Hydration Needs
----------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is essential for good health, but did you know that your activity level can greatly influence how much water you need each day? Different activities challenge your body in various ways, affecting your hydration needs significantly. Understanding this relationship can help you determine how much water you should drink based on your lifestyle.

### The Impact of Activity Levels on Hydration

Your hydration needs change depending on how active you are. Here are key factors to consider:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Sedentary Lifestyle:** If you spend most of your day sitting, your hydration needs will be lower compared to someone who is active. For most sedentary adults, aiming for about 2 to 3 liters (about 8-12 cups) of water a day is generally sufficient.
- **Moderate Activity:** If you engage in regular exercise or physical activity, your requirement increases. People who work out 3-5 times a week need to drink more water to replace what they lose through sweat and respiration. Around 3 to 4 liters (about 12-16 cups) is a good target in this case.
- **High Intensity Activity:** For individuals participating in intense training sessions, like competitive athletes or those involved in high-intensity workouts, the recommendation can escalate significantly. Depending on the duration and intensity of their activities, daily water intake can range from 4 to 6 liters (about 16-24 cups) or more.

It's important to remember that hydration goes beyond just drinking water‚Äîeating foods with high water content also contributes significantly to your total fluid intake.

### Signs of Dehydration

Your body communicates its hydration needs through various signs. Recognizing these can help you adjust your water intake effectively:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Thirst:** The most obvious sign, but waiting too long to drink can lead to dehydration.
- **Dry Mouth and Lips:** This indicates that your body needs more fluids.
- **Dark Urine:** Ideally, urine should be light yellow. Dark urine can signal dehydration.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired can sometimes be a result of inadequate hydration.
- **Headaches:** Dehydration can trigger tension headaches or migraines in some individuals.

### Hydration Tips for Different Activity Levels

Depending on your activity level, you can follow these hydration tips to ensure you are getting enough fluids:

- **For Sedentary Individuals:** Keep a water bottle on your desk. Set reminders to take sips throughout the day. Aim for at least 8 cups of water.
- **For Active Individuals:** Increase your intake before, during, and after workouts. Consider electrolyte drinks if you sweat heavily.
- **For Athletes:** Assess your hydration needs based on your training schedule. Utilize a hydration app or journal to track your intake and adjust accordingly.

Monitoring fluid loss during workouts can also help you determine your personal hydration needs. A simple method is to weigh yourself before and after your exercise session to assess how much fluid loss occurred.

### Factors Influencing Hydration Beyond Activity

While activity level significantly impacts hydration needs, other factors play a role as well:

- **Climate:** Hot and humid weather increases sweating, requiring additional water intake.
- **Altitude:** Higher altitudes can cause increased urination and more rapid breathing, both of which lead to greater fluid loss.
- **Diet:** High salt or sugar diets may necessitate increased water consumption to help balance your intake.
- **Health Conditions:** Certain medical issues or medications can also influence how much water you need.

Understanding your body and how it responds to different activities‚Äîfrom light daily tasks to intense workout routines‚Äîcan empower you to drink the right amount of water. So next time you think about your hydration needs, remember to consider your activity level. Your body will thank you for it!

- Watermelon
- Strawberries
- Cantaloupe
- Spinach
- Cucumbers

Adding these foods to your meals can contribute to your daily hydration goals.

### Make It a Social Habit

Involve friends or family in your hydration goals. Challenge each other to drink more water, or make it a fun activity. For example, you can have a water-drinking contest, where everyone tries to drink a certain amount by a specific time. Making it social can inspire you and others to prioritize hydration.

### Track Your Progress

Keeping track of how much water you drink can reinforce your commitment. Use a journal or an app to log your daily intake. Celebrate small milestones you achieve along the way. Acknowledging your progress can boost motivation and make you more conscious of your hydration levels.

### Be Mindful of Your Caffeine and Alcohol Intake

Caffeinated and alcoholic beverages can contribute to dehydration, so be mindful of your consumption. If you drink coffee, tea, or alcohol, balance these with additional water. A good rule of thumb is to drink one glass of water for every caffeinated or alcoholic beverage you consume.

1hmt56p,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1hmt56p/the_coffee_machine_gift/,The coffee machine 'gift' ,"So a few years ago, I was visiting my parents, when my dad asked me if I wanted this disposable-cup espresso machine. My parents actually have one of those 4000$ espresso machines, but they had to take it in for repairs, so they'd ordered this one for the interim. As it happened, it got fixed in only a couple of days, and they couldn't be bothered to return this smaller one, so I decided why not, I bought some coffee and reusable cups, and used it occasionally for a couple of months. 

The my mom said they needed to borrow it for their next vacation, since they didn't want to depend on hotel coffee. I brought it over, they were puzzled over the reusable cups and complained it didn't look new anymore and what happened to the disposable cups they'd given me with the machine (... I used them?) , and when they returned weeks later I went back to visit and got summarily handed the machine back, except for the reusable cups. Neither could remember what happened to them. I didn't want to go to the Nespresso shop to buy more, so it gathered dust for a few months before... They demanded it back for another vacation. *They then complained they would have to buy more cups since I didn't have any*. 

So it took me way too long to understand my kitchen was just the storage for their travel coffee machine, actually? I *forgot* to take it back home for months before they gave up and found a cupboard for it.

1hmt53r,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1hmt53r/in_sickness_and_dysfunction_my_mom_needs_therapy/,In Sickness and Dysfunction - My mom needs therapy but she refuses,"I‚Äôm losing my mind because I‚Äôm not equipped to handle this. I‚Äôm fortunate/unfortunate that my family moved far away from me, and I‚Äôll be moving even farther in 2025. They‚Äôre now in the middle of the U.S., while I‚Äôm still on the East Coast. My sister moved out there for a job, had kids, and my mom wanted to be closer to her grandkids.

Let‚Äôs backtrack a bit. I lived with my parents for way too long, not moving out until I was nearly 30. I‚Äôm 38 now, soon to be engaged, and planning to move to Austria in 2025.

Back in the early 2010s, my mom lost her job due to clashes with her bosses‚Äîit was her own fault, though we can‚Äôt tell her that. She should‚Äôve started therapy back then, but she constantly refused. Meanwhile, my dad was working under the table while on disability (he wasn‚Äôt doing manual labor; he has MS, which has since been reclassified as Parkinson‚Äôs).

Around 2017 or 2018, my dad got caught working under the table, turned in by a disgruntled ex of my late uncle. He almost went to prison, and my sister and I were terrified because he‚Äôs always been there for us. Despite his illness, he stayed active during our teen and college years, even paying off my student loans and helping with my sister‚Äôs.

During this crisis, my mom made everything about her. She talked about divorcing my dad, which disgusted us. Around the same time, she developed a (thankfully mild) case of breast cancer. My sister and I initially dismissed it because she blamed it on ‚Äústress from dealing with your father.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt until my dad got upset that we didn‚Äôt call her before her biopsy that we started taking it seriously. We didn‚Äôt have the heart to tell him what she‚Äôd been saying.

Thankfully, her cancer was treated successfully. However, she often said she‚Äôd refuse chemo and ‚Äújust accept her death,‚Äù which upset us‚Äîespecially my sister, who was planning her wedding and future family. We love our mom but hated that she‚Äôd give up so easily.

As for my dad, the trial ended better than we expected. He spent five hours in jail, paid back a lot of disability money, and kept his benefits. It was a stressful ordeal, but I got him a 3D-printed Monopoly ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card as a joke.

Eventually, my mom got a new job as a school bus driver, which suited her surprisingly well (imagine a 4‚Äô10‚Äù woman driving a bus lol). After a while, she decided to move to Arkansas to be near my sister and her kids.

Fast forward to 2024: my parents now live in Arkansas, about 20 minutes from my sister‚Äôs family. My mom still struggles with the ‚Äúin sickness and in health‚Äù part of her marriage vows, which has been a recurring issue. My dad‚Äôs Parkinson‚Äôs has progressed, but while he has some cognitive decline, he‚Äôs still functional‚Äîwalking the dog, doing puzzles, and staying active. Yet, my mom acts like she‚Äôs carrying the weight of the world, constantly complaining to my sister and me about him.

For example, the other day, he accidentally tracked dog poop inside after stepping in it while wearing slippers. My mom cried and complained because he ignored the sign she put up about not doing that. I told her to have him clean it up, but she refused, saying he wouldn‚Äôt shampoo the rug properly (even though their house is mostly hardwood and tile).

She‚Äôs also upset that he‚Äôs not exercising more, saying he should be out running‚Äîeven though he‚Äôs more physically active than my sister or me! Meanwhile, she runs on her treadmill obsessively. She complains that they don‚Äôt watch TV together, despite knowing my dad would enjoy the Marvel movies she loves if she just asked him. Instead, she refuses to take initiative and lets it fester.

Recently, my dad spilled coffee because he couldn‚Äôt figure out the new machine. He cleaned it up, but it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù for her. She assumes he‚Äôs ignoring her when he doesn‚Äôt respond, even though she *knows* his hearing is bad. He also forgets things or mishears, but she takes it personally.

I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end. She‚Äôs showing signs of caregiver burnout, even though she‚Äôs not really his caregiver beyond driving him to appointments and cooking. I keep pushing her to get therapy, but she refuses.

On top of that, my sister uses my parents as free maids, having them clean up after her kids (ages 3, 5, and 1) before her actual maid comes. This just adds to my mom‚Äôs sense of being overwhelmed. I‚Äôve told her to say no, but she acts like she‚Äôs obligated, and I can‚Äôt understand why.

I‚Äôm mentally exhausted. While I‚Äôm happy to be far away from all this, I‚Äôll be even happier to be an ocean away when I move. Still, I miss my dysfunctional family‚Äîdespite all the chaos.",1,1735233911.0,venting,1,1.0,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.



* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

RV living has been an adventure, to say the least, over the past few months. I‚Äôm saving every penny I can, so paying for a dedicated lot to drop the camper isn‚Äôt in the cards just yet. Instead, I‚Äôve been relying on ‚Äústealth camping,‚Äù where I find a quiet spot, set up for the night, and try to blend in. It works well enough‚Äîthough the generator running sometimes draws more attention than I‚Äôd like. 

The problem is that stealth spots don‚Äôt stay stealthy once the sun comes up. Most are in areas that get busy during 9-5, so I‚Äôm usually up and out early to avoid notice. With my old truck‚Äîhigh miles and all‚ÄîI try to stick close to work and my mechanic‚Äôs shop. My options are limited to large parking lots since not many spots can accommodate a 40-foot rig. 

Walmart is my go-to. It‚Äôs close to the highway and attracts truckers with plenty of parking space. It‚Äôs also generally safe‚Äîofficers patrol the area, and I don‚Äôt have to deal with random walkers. But down the road at Ace Hardware and Winn-Dixie? That‚Äôs a whole different story. 

This morning, as I sipped my coffee, I saw something that left me questioning reality. A woman came strolling down the sidewalk, dragging a gardening hoe behind her like a bizarre accessory. She stopped when she saw the semi parked nearby, then turned her attention to my truck. What happened next was pure chaos: she started using the hoe as a makeshift pole, performing an impromptu dance routine on the sidewalk. She even pointed dramatically at me and the trucker, like we were part of her audience. 

It was a spectacle I never expected to witness‚Äîespecially not at 8am in the morning, with MLK Boulevard buzzing with rush-hour traffic. The honks from passing cars only added to the absurdity. Honestly, it might have rivaled the time I saw a woman at a liquor store with a Kotex pad stuck to her forehead. (That one still holds the top spot, though.) 

I‚Äôll admit, I considered recording the scene, but drawing even more attention wasn‚Äôt worth it. Instead, I let the madness unfold from the safety of my cab. 

This is why I stick with Walmart‚Äôs parking lot. It‚Äôs far enough from sidewalks to avoid this kind of chaos, and I can blend in with the other truckers lying low until the end of day. 

Here, I occasionally get approached by people asking for change, a cigarette, or a ride. But I keep my windows closed, my MacBook out of sight, and my guard up. The last thing I need is someone recognizing my rig and bothering me later.

1hmt4ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/CounterTops/comments/1hmt4ey/how_can_i_remove_deep_stains_from_quartz/,How can I remove deep stains from Quartz countertops?,"4 years ago I installed white quartz countertops. These countertops have stained very easily over the years, mostly from coffee and acidic fruits. On top of that I was recommended magic eraser pads which worked, but over time caused more damage by removing whatever protective layer was on top of the countertops. Then in a moment of desperation, I was recommended acetone which completely ruined the countertop. I have been told that the design on quartz is surface level and grinding it down at all will remove that design. I have also been told that there is no way to seal quartz after grinding it down. No idea if any of this is true. 

TLDR; I'm a desperate idiot and now have deeply stained white quartz countertops. Is there any way to fix this? ",1,1735233857.0,CounterTops,0,1.0,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

For the past decade, I‚Äôve relied on caffeine to get me through each day. Sometimes 1, 2, 3, even 4 helpings of coffee and/or high caf tea. 7 months ago, I quit caffeine in an effort to prove to myself I don‚Äôt need it. I had barely any withdrawals, but the constant fatigue wasn‚Äôt letting up. Little did I know, caffeine was masking the symptoms of my iron deficiency. 

So after a few months of constant lethargy, I faced my fears and got long overdue blood work. Fears because I faint and black out every time I‚Äôve gotten blood work - the last time, I had an unwitnessed fall after asking for water and being left unattended. Woke up on the ground surrounded by glass, doctors hovering over me. Very traumatic. 

Upon the recent blood work visit, I asked to be horizontal during it, and had apple juice, snacks, stress ball, everything ready to go. It was scary, but I persisted lol. My iron levels were, according to the doctor, ‚Äúabysmally low.‚Äù (My iron saturation was 8%; the lowest end of the scale for women is 14%).

They had me taking 325mg iron tablets every other day - my body went from 0 to 100. After some unexpected side effects and a couple more doctor visits, now I take the same amount once every 3 days. 

My gums no longer bleed, and for the first time in my life, I had a biannual dentist visit with zero issues, no misdiagnosed gingivitis, no cavities. For the first time in my life, I do not have debilitating, plan-cancelling, excruciating . cramps. I no longer crave things like ice chips. I have been able to start working out again, which has done wonders for me mentally & emotionally. 

I feel like a human again - and still haven‚Äôt had any caffeine. If anyone is out there struggling, ask me anything! You‚Äôre not alone. ",9,1735233707.0,Anemic,3,1.0,False

I am genuinely confused,"There it was, in their World War II paper: ‚ÄúChristmas in Love (2018) provides a touching portrayal of wartime romance.‚Äù I did a double-take, hoping I was hallucinating. Nope. They even included it in their bibliography like it was The History Channel. I circled it in red and wrote, ‚ÄúPretty sure Hallmark isn‚Äôt peer-reviewed.‚Äù To their credit, the rest of the paper wasn‚Äôt half bad. ""During World War II, soldiers found hope through love letters and festive traditions, as beautifully depicted in Christmas in Love (2018).""They even threw in a follow-up about ‚Äúhow small-town values and Christmas spirit sustained morale on the front lines.‚Äù I nearly choked on my coffee. I mean, points for trying to tie Hallmark fluff to history, but... yeah, no.

Yeah, I'm looking for a fubu or something like that. Maybe you know, more? I dunno, depends on how it works. Okay, point is I'm looking for a friend with the same interests but I I'd like to fuck them, too. Emphasis on friendship though. As much as I enjoy the carnal union of flesh, I enjoy the person and bonding with them. Building connections and what not. Does not have to be romantic or anything. Puwede naman purely platonic. I know my boundaries. I'm not in a rush. We can build things slowly, at your phase. 

Benefits:

* Can interest you with a diversity of wholesome and nerdy hobbies
* Can easily be called to listen to your woes in life
* Can direct you on how to commute or get somewhere when you're lost
* Can critique your academic paper
* Can make you recommendation letters
* Can cook for you meals on request
* Can give you a good massage
* Can give you a genuine bond
* Can accompany you to the most mundane and most extreme of activities
* Can easily be called
* Can easily pretend to be someone else around family and friends for functions

Drawbacks:

* You'll find random things in places where they're not supposed to be
* You'll be inconvenienced as I hide all of your cords and adaptors
* You'll be embarrassed I scream and groan randomly in public
* You won't be able to make coffee or tea when I hide the base of your electric kettle
* You'll smell like tinola when I place chicken cubes in your showerhead
* You'll be wondering why the soap won't lather when I paint your soaps with clear nail polish

About me:

**About me**

* 29
* Manila
* Struggling with Master's Thesis (On leave until the end of this semester)
* Working for the academe (publish or perish)
* INFJ, Virgo-Leo Cusp (If any of it matters)
* 5""6 in height with normal Body Mass Index
* I get uncomfortable when I get bits of my soul seen \*hisses at psychology majors\*
* Was told to be cute but probably not your type
* Wholesome most of the time\*
* I have a dark and very questionable sense of humor and taste for memes.
* I'm a nerd. No, not the Asian cute one. More of the generic academic type of nerd
* Weird. I shout randomly sometimes and poke fun out of things
* From a lower-middle class socioeconomic bracket
* I don't drive motorized vehicles. I support green and sustainable modes of transportation.
* I enjoy great and classical works in music, animation, and film
* I can be quite philosophical (I subscribe to Camus sksksks)
* I enjoy a lot of great classics in terms of literature, music, pop culture references
* I do enjoy my fair share of alcohol
* I play some games, too, from time to time
* Sira-ulong naghahanap ng kapwa sira-ulo
* Mostly alive to spite the absurdity of the universe as an act of love and rebellion.",1,1735233152.0,PHR4Rhookups,0,1.0,False
1hmsuzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hmsuzz/i_hate_my_grandparents_right_now/,I hate my grandparents right now,"Had a huge blowout argument with them this morning and I‚Äôve been festering about it all day. I don‚Äôt know how to forgive them or deal with their shit going forward.

Concisely: my mum has terminal cancer and is extremely ill, and over the last few years has put distance between herself and her parents. This is difficult because they live with us, in a granny annexe next door that we built for them. They kick off about it and make us all feel like crap for ‚Äònot doing enough for them‚Äô and ‚Äònot liking them‚Äô. 

My nan is the most passive aggressive woman I‚Äôve ever met, and has a very nasty streak. She constantly makes snide comments to my mum, attempts to make her feel guilty and small and once my mum became ill she finally snapped and put a stop to her parents trying to control her and live through her. They stay inside their annexe all day, have refused to step foot outside without us driving them somewhere or another relative visiting, and used to rely on my mum for everything. This has been the case since they moved in here 10 years ago. They can‚Äôt do that now, because she is dying and doesn‚Äôt fucking want to, and they try and make her feel selfish for it!!! 

They‚Äôve never gone out to the village to try and have their own life, never been to a coffee morning or a club or anything. They sit and wallow about totally squandering the bit of money they had in the 80s and ending up with sweet fuck all. My grandad is arrogant and misogynistic, used to have a ton of affairs and yet likes to make moral judgements about everyone else. 

This morning my nan stomped off from my mum when she found out that she and I had spent a bit of time doing a jigsaw together on Xmas Day after they went home from lunch at ours. My mum spent 90% of the day laying on the sofa in agony, as she does most days, and yet she‚Äôs made to feel selfish for doing a bloody jigsaw with her daughter for 20 minutes?! Mum broke down sobbing after they had a row.

They will probably go to their graves thinking that they‚Äôve done absolutely nothing wrong in their lives and that there‚Äôs some grand conspiracy against them, and it boils my blood. They‚Äôre making the worst time of our lives harder and I‚Äôll never ever forgive them for that.",5,1735233144.0,Vent,3,1.0,False

So I‚Äôm considering a switch to XL. My main reason for taking it is to deal with crushing fatigue, with depression/anxiety a close second. and I‚Äôm worried about XL because I see so many people on XL saying they‚Äôre very tired from it. Also, I like to drink coffee a couple of times a week and drink alcohol occasionally, and both of those things have been super problematic for me while taking SR.

It‚Äôs not just a piece of furniture‚Äîit‚Äôs an opportunity to showcase your style and bring functionality to the space. Whether you‚Äôre looking to refresh your decor or maximize practicality, here are some creative center table ideas to inspire you!

**1. Minimalist Glass Tables**

For a clean and modern look, opt for a sleek glass table. It‚Äôs perfect for small spaces as it creates an illusion of openness and doesn‚Äôt overpower the room. Pair it with neutral or metallic accents for a sophisticated vibe.

**2. Rustic Wooden Charm**

A reclaimed wood center table adds a touch of rustic charm and warmth. Its organic textures make it a great fit for farmhouse or boho-style interiors.

**3. Multi-Functional Marvels**

In compact living rooms, functionality is key. Look for center tables with built-in storage or convertible features. These tables are perfect for storing magazines, remotes, or even blankets while keeping the space tidy.

**4. Ottoman Centerpieces**

An upholstered ottoman can double as a center table and extra seating. Add a decorative tray on top for drinks or decor items, and you‚Äôve got a versatile and stylish piece.

**5. Geometric and Statement Pieces**

For a bold statement, choose a table with a unique geometric shape or artistic design. These eye-catching pieces can serve as conversation starters and add a modern twist to your living room.

**6. Nature-Inspired Tables**

Bring a bit of the outdoors in with center tables featuring stone, marble, or even live-edge wood designs. These materials add an earthy elegance to your decor.

**7. Nest Tables for Flexibility**

Nest tables offer versatility and are great for small spaces. Use them together as a centerpiece or pull them apart to serve as additional surfaces when entertaining guests.

**8. Vintage Coffee Table Finds**

Hunting for a vintage coffee table at thrift stores or flea markets can yield unique treasures that add character to your living room.

We also have a dollhouse of our own and a barn. I've decided to get a coffee table for the playroom to make a doll house village.

My children are 16 months F and 2.5 F, so dollhouses are all the rage. But what's gonna give me rage is the 50 million furniture pieces everywhere.  

My husband and I are in disagreement. I want to craft glue a lot of the furniture down. He doesn't want me to even touch them because it's more fun to move the furniture around. 

He isn't the one cleaning up the furniture pieces and putting them nicely in the house. Every night, I already reassemble the doll house we have and the barn. All the animals and dolls going to bed sort of thing. 

He just throws it all together in a bin and let them choose. The youngest just wants to dump the bin out because it's tempting to her. 

So my question is, have any of you glued doll house furniture down? Was it worth it, and if so, what glue held up the best? ",3,1735232674.0,Parenting,4,0.72,False

At a coffee shop this morning and haven‚Äôt used pens in quite some time, recently just got back into writing after a 6 month stint and now my hands are readjusting to using pens.

Need help trying to figure out some new pen options, a pen that doesn‚Äôt write as thinly as the first sentence. Something that doesn‚Äôt puke out as much ink as the second. Lastly, a pen that projects ink consistently, not inconsistent as the third sentence. 

I‚Äôve also seen some people make the argument that the type of paper you write on will make a huge difference, reason being why I thought I‚Äôd ask this subreddit, I will also ask the Pens reddit of course, but frankly I like this reddit group more.

With glue, squareness, flatness, moisture, general carefulness? What do you do? ","Yeah maybe this is a vent post about being home for the holidays and seeing my father's nightmare of a garage.

I work in higher education, running a college shop space. I'm no master woodworker, but I'm a good teacher, I've handled introducing nearly 200 students to the craft this year, and the personal projects I make are pretty decent too. I'm VERY used to offering corrections to novice woodworkers, just as long as they're willing to learn, are ages 18-25, and aren't the damn man who raised me! 

This guy.... Every time I'm over, he brings me out to the garage to ask for my advice and it's always....something. It's great that he want to make things, but the man does not know carefulness, patience, or listening to feedback. 

I've seen ""Board flattening jig I made for this slab I found on Craigslist. I think jigs are a bad idea, this one fell apart on me. Yeah, it's made of wet scrap OSB and nails, would that be an issue?"" 

I've seen ""A big panel glue-up that I can't seem to get flat. Yes, it's 2""-8"" boards of 1/2"" un-planed nail-filled warpy bowy pallet wood, but I jointed the edges so shouldn't that make the glue-up flat?""

I've seen ""A coffee table I'm trying to flip won't stay together and looks weird. Yeah I ran out of wood glue, so the top is attached with silicone adhesive. Yeah I didn't have the wax/oil/finish you reccommended, but I did have some auto body wax so I just used that."" 

At best, seeing what this man gets up to just creates an uncomfortable situation in the moment, and gives me a funny story to tell my partner on the way home. At worst, I get a minor heart attack seeing him running garbage, nail-filled wood on his machines (and he already nipped the tip of his pinky off on his table saw a few years ago).

The chilling arctic wind nipped at the exposed cheeks of a boy, accompanied by his uncle, father, and dog. The chilling breeze whistled past the individuals as the deep snow crunched beneath their feet. Furs and leathers were doubled in layers, thick straps utilized to create a tight fit to block out the cold. ""How much further?"" The young boy asked, chattering his teeth between each word. There was no answer for some time before his uncle stopped and knelt down to face him. ""We are almost on its trail. We have to be careful and silent. If it hears us approaching, we could be next."" The boy nodded and stifled the fear welling up inside of him. Footsteps continued, and the dog pounced through the snow, occasionally pausing to sniff the air. A strong vortex picked up, and the animal let out a deep growl. It gnashed its teeth towards the flurry of snow that was getting heavier. The group stopped, watching the dogs actions. Hand signals were used. Unfortunately, the boy had no idea what they meant. Soon, a sound crept into their ears. It started off soft, barely a murmur until it reached a crescendo that rivaled the wind. It was laughter. The eerie tone of it sent a chill to run down the boy's spine.

The chime was hollow and emotionless. It returned in waves of threes. The hair on the dogs back stood up, and it spun towards the group. Foaming saliva rolled from the gleaming teeth, turning to ice from the harsh weather. It barked and then lunged towards the boy. In a flash of quick movements, blood spattered on the fresh snow, followed by the final yelp of the rabid creature. The boy's father stood motionless, still clutching the spear he had used to stop the dog. ""It's here."" The man spoke without removing his gaze from the animal. The spear was removed, and they continued forward. Waves of laughter returned but more profound this time. The boy was instructed to cover his ears. He did so and followed the adults until they came upon footprints. Large prints of barefeet trudged through frozen layers of dark blood. Drag marks followed each foot as if something was being pulled at each side of the wanderer. Fear bubbled up through the boy, and he shivered. The act was not from the cold but the agonizing terror of the thing they pursued.

Menacing chuckles followed with the wind, and the boy pressed harder against his frigid ears. The sound was muffled but still apparent. He looked down towards his feet, occasionally spying more of those massive bloodied footprints. Before long, he ran into the still frame of his father. No words were spoken or hand gestures utilized. Instead, the boys father grunted and nodded his head. The pulsing heart inside the boy's body skipped a beat when his eyes fell upon what had caused the ceasing of motion. Towards a frost covered boulder, stood a man. Not an ordinary man by any means. This man was deathly thin with pale skin that had an opalescent sheen. Ice crystals covered countless areas of the abrasive flesh along with purple and black splotches of frostbite. Aside from the bits of tattered and rotting furs, the body was exposed to the elements. Long strands of frozen hair dangled in front of a gaunt face. Barely visible through the locks of obsidian were a set of unblinking eyes. Wide and without pupils, the things scanned the white landscape. A crooked smile stretched across cracked, blue lips. A long stream of brown liquid stained the corners and dripped over the jawline. 

The things head looked left, then right before kneeling down. That horrible laugh spewed from the sinister mouth. The thing began to fumble with something at its feet. The three stood there in awe, trying to ascertain what it was doing. Realization took over in the form of the boy gasping. Tears dropped and froze to his skin as he cried at the sight of his dead mother and sister. Their corpses tangled together in a small pool of blood. Their furs had large rips, exposing torn flesh. The most horrific part was there still open eyes, accompanied by the same smile as the thing that took them. The mystery of their fates had been discovered in the worst possible way. Chomping and slurping comensed as the wretched thing began to eat the remnants of the two women. The boy clinched his teeth and tried to hold back the wailing but to no avail. He let out a cry that caught the attention of the emaciated creature. The boy's uncle quickly cupped his mouth. ""Hush. You need to be quiet."" But it was too late. The creature had stopped its feast and jerked its head forward. Blood oozed from the grinning mouth, and it stood up.

There was no time to plan, only attack. The boys father let out a war cry and charged towards the thing, spear gripped in both hands. The second adult followed suit after instructing the boy to remain at his spot. The men charged towards the scrawny and menacing ice demin. The charging hastened until all three crashed with a thud. The spear missed its target, the father was knocked back, and the uncle was lifted from the ground with a bony hand. The laughing echoed in the dry air. The creature's free hand rose and spread a set of five abnormally long fingers with deep black nails at the end. The next few moments are blurry due to the child covering his face. But in the end, his uncle was dead and bloody, a large smile etched on his lifeless face. The boys father fought with all his might but also lost. The scuffle and weight of the three bodies caused a large crack to form below their feet. None aware of the fact they they stood on a thick slab of ice. The cracking grew louder until a hole gave way, sending the boys father and the monster jolting towards the icy depths. The boy sat in fright as he watched his father sink. His heart thumped in his chest at the loss. However, the worst sight was that of the pale face, slowly sinking into the abyss. Those white eyes pierced through the frozen locks of hair. Its laugh seeped through the display of sharp teeth that echoed until it finally broke the waters edge, leaving the boy all alone in the desolate cold.

The glowing numbers of the alarm clock shifted from 6:59 to 7:00, and the voice of Burl Ives rang through its speaker, telling the world to have a Holly Jolly Christmas. ""God damnit! Shut up!"" Screamed the already annoyed man who quickly sat up his bed. He jammed his thumb into the off button and got to his feet. ""God, I hate this shit."" He spoke to himself while putting on his pants and walking to his dresser. A bottle of whiskey was snatched up, and the lid was removed. The man grabbed the glass next to it and poured the brown liquid, then swallowed the whole thing in one gulp. The sting of the alcohol caused a wince, then warmth took over as it slowly made its way down to the man's stomach. He put on a shirt and then stepped out of the bedroom. A loud ringing echoed in the hallway, which sent the man speed walking towards it. He lifted the recieve and spoke in a harsh voice. ""Yea?"" Another voice came from the other end. ""Rick. He's back."" The man holding the phone raised an eyebrow. ""Who's back?"" There was not a moment of pause with the response. ""Angel maker."" Anger welled up in the man, and he snorted. ""Give me the address, and I'll be there as soon as I can."" He wrote down the info on a sticky note and hastily got ready.

With the turning of a key, the car purred to life. The winter air left a trail of steam to rise from the tail pipe. The vehicle sped off, and the anxious man, better known as Detective Rick Ellner, was headed towards what was most likely another twisted gift from a demented giver. Rick drove through the frost covered streets of the town he had grown up in his whole life. Snow shifting lazily with the slight breeze in the air. Christmas lights were on display but not lit, wreaths and trees set up, images of Santa, and periodically he saw children building snowmen. All of the things he loathed this time of year. When most people think of Christmas, they associate the holiday with joy, family, and happiness. For Rick, it only meant sorrow, regret, anger, and solitude. This would mark the third year of a dreadful season. His thoughts harkened back to his wife and children. Their faces, smiling and displaying those soft, happy eyes. Then, the mood shifted into tears, screaming and crying. The reel of images morphed from scene to scene until it landed on the monstrous displays of desecrated bodies. All sprawled out in the snow, covered in blood and lascerations. Angel Maker, the name coined for a heartless lunatic who had sent a plague of fear to infect the town of Allavandrel. Bodies tore open, stuffed with Yule tide trinkets of all sorts. Blood coated their bodies and left to freeze in the cold. These corpses all had been manipulated in the snow to create wings beneath them. Hence, the name published in tabloids and news bulletins.

This had been Rick's obsession ever since he was called to the first case. The lifeless body of a fifteen year old girl left him feeling dead inside. This spanned a total of nine other victims, all left in the same manner. No clues found, no murder weapon. There was nothing to link a culprit to these heinous acts of violence. The work spilled into his home life, which in turn led him to becoming an alcoholic. The liquor morphed Rick into an abusive, neglectful terror within the walls of his home. Instead of finding the serial killer, he took his frustration out on his family. After the fifth broken bone, his wife divorced him and took the kids without warning. A week before Christmas. Since then, the lonesome detective had zero contact with his children and didn't even know where they went. Instead of sobering up and trying to make amends, Rick spiraled deeper into his bottle and spent every waking moment plotting his suicide. However, in reality, he was a coward and could never bring himself to pull the trigger. So instead, he wasted away on boose and obsessing over the elusive creator of bloodied snow angels. The case went cold after the ninth week. Two things were maintained with this sadistic bastard, his MO, and his pattern. After the first snow, a body would be found in a public place, and each week, another would arrive until the body count reached that magic number , and Angel Maker would dissappear. The monster had returned with the cold once again, and Rick was determined to get his guy this time. 

III.

Rick pulled up to the edge of Boyce Park. A crowd had already formed near the caution tape. The radio in his car was blaring a news report. ""Despite the freezing temperatures, the polar ice caps continue to melt, sending waves of water and huge chunks of ice..."" Rick turned the car off and stepped out.

He pushed his way past people, completely ignoring the relentless news reporter who had received a broken jaw from the last time he attempted to interview Rick last year. Once past the tape and local police officers, Rick's partner shuffled towards him. ""Bout damn time you got here! The bastard changed things up with this one."" The stocky frame of Detective Trevor Jameson, or TJ for short, whisked Rick hurriedly towards the crime scene. In a distasteful display of savagery lay the remains of a young woman. She was posed flat on the snow, the form of an angel beneath her, coated in blood. No clothing covered the body, showing the gaping slash in the woman's abdomen that expelled frozen entrails wrapped up in the shape of a bow. Christmas lights were wrapped around her neck, which had also been slashed open. The usually leavings of Rick's bane of existence. But this time, something was different.

""Female, early twenties, maybe younger. As usual, her throat and stomach were slashed. As we expected, Angel maker left his signature symbol and decorated the body. But this time it's different, take a look."" Rick followed the hand his partner pointed with to view the face. The poor woman's eyes were gone and replaced with pieces of a shattered mirror. Wedged in viciously. ""Sick son of a bitch."" Rick muttered under his breath. TJ gave further details then ended with the question of what the mirrored eyes meant. No real answer was given. Instead, Rick scanned the scene, noticing that only one set of foot prints were present. A set of two right at the womans feet, as if the killer stood there to admire his work. Another repititious detail from prior murders. In the past, molds had been made to get a print for whatever shoes were worn but nothing ever came through. Upon further inspection, it was noted that a section of hair was removed along with her pinky finger. This was not new because Angel Maker always took a piece of his victims, except this time he took two articles. A year had already passed since the last string of murders and this one occurred on the exact same day as previous years but felt different in ways. Rick told himself that this would be the end of the sick bastard. Eventually, the two men left the scene to escape the cold and get coffee to further discuss the newest addition to the list of slain women. 

The victim followed the exact same circumstances as the others. Esteemed and loved individual who had been kidnapped out of the blue from another state to be found sometime later, disgraced and mutiliated by the hands of Allavandrel's infamous serial killer. Every victim hailed from neighboring states and would later be dumped in Maine. The first one of the year was always left in a public place for all to see. The others left in more obscure regions of town. But they all maintained their locations in this specific town. That detail led the authorities to believe Angel Maker was a native of Allavandrel. But since the beginning of the crimes, no suspects or evidence whatsoever had been found. Rick pondered on this as he stirred the spoon in his coffee. TJ continued discussing the case, all details going in one ear and out the other for Rick. That was until his partner pointed out that this new girl was found only ten yards from the very first victim. Rick had been so focused on the body that he hadn't realized the location. That night he stayed up late with a bottle of Jack and the case files from Angel Maker's first appearance. The tumblers were rolling in Rick's head and his focus was at full force towards finding the deranged psychopath. 

IV. 

A week had passed since the discovery of the woman found in Boyce Park, and Rick had yet to find any new details. His stress was rising, especially after another victim was found, courtesy of his enemy. The second bloody snow angel was found near Olive Creek, which Rick realized was the same as the second victim from the first year of Angel Maker. The only difference was that this new woman was on the opposite edge of the water. This unfortunate soul also had an organ replaced. Her heart was ripped out, and in its place was a glass tree ornament in the shape of a cartoon heart. The shiny object reflected the angered face of Rick. ""God damnit. How did no one see anything?!"" Tj placed a hand on his shoulder. ""I don't know, Rick. We're just lucky I was out on a stroll and found her. We're gonna get him this time."" The cold breeze picked up and assaulted Rick's face. He shook it off and got back to his feet. ""Let's go, TJ. We need to go through the files. If he's repeating his first kills, then we know where the next girl will be."" TJ lagged behind, but soon the two were both in the car. They made their way to the station, the radio giving another bulletin. ""More and more melted water is causing floods near"" Static chirped to interrupt the announcers voice, then it returned. ""Large chunks of ice have drifted towards areas such as"" Just then, the cb radio cracked to life. ""Detective Ellner, please respond to a code J Zero One"" Without hesitation, Rick picked up the radio receiver. ""This is Ellner, We're on it. Location?"" Instantly, the two thought another Angel Maker scene, even though it was too soon. Their thoughts changed when they made it to the outskirts of town.

Near the welcome sign of Allavandrel, crumpled in the fetal position was a body. The sight of the corpse was not accompanied by an angelic figure of snow. The individual was fully clothed, save for the large gashes, and cuts around the back and chest area. No major wounds, replaced organs or Christmas decor. The victim was male, which had never been part of Angel Maker's selected victims. Several questions filled the minds of the detectives as they knelt down to examine the scene. Blood was frozen to the fabric and snow, and deep cuts. The wounds were not deep enough to cause death, however. Once photos were taken and the body was able to be moved, a gasp escaped the coroner. Rick and TJ looked, and both men raised an eyebrow. Then TJ muttered softly. ""What in the hell?"" Stetched across the dead man's face was a ghastly smile. The corners of his mouth were cracked, showing every tooth that was stained with a brown sludge. The eyes were wide open but lacked any color except for the enlarged pupils. It was grotesque, and the face looked more like a Halloween mask than a flesh and blood face. The body was placed in a bag and hauled off to the station. 

Rick went home around two in the morning, scratching his head at what the new crime was. Could Angel Maker have chosen to change his tactics? Could the monster have decided to grab an extra kill? The last question he asked himself really sent his stomach to his feet. Was there another serial killer loose in town? Rick's mind swirled with questions and theories, but nothing gave answers or any clarity. The only solution he found was at the bottom of a liquor bottle. Two days later, another smiling corpse was found. It resembled the same pattern as the first, but only this time, it was an elderly woman. Tj was on a different call, so Rick was alone during his examination. The look of the smiling, decrepit face left him feeling uneasy. The more he focused on it, the more melancholy it became. Then, out of nowhere, a sound flooded his hears. A low murmur of a laugh. Dry and emotionless, like that of morbid sarcasm. It tickled his ear, and he looked in all directions but did not find the owner of the ominous laugh. He thought his mind was playing tricks on him. But as he left the scene, the wind blew, and the hollow chuckle accompanied it. 

V.

It was two weeks before Christmas, and in that time, three more girls were discovered along with four more smiling bodies. To add to the unease and frustration, sting operations had been placed in hopes of catching Angel Maker. The latest bodies were all found near the same areas as the first appearanceof Allavandrel'sserial killer. But even though multiple squad cars sat for reconicenese, there were no sightings. It was only after the authorities left the scene that the bodies were discovered. As if Angel Maker was watching and knew the police were waiting. Things were getting strange, and it left more questions than answers. Even stranger was that Rick noticed that his partner was always either the one to discover them or the first on scene. Then there were the smiling faces of the dead found in the outskirts of town that slowly reached the main hub of Allavandrel. Rick thought he was losing his mind because every body he examined, that dry, crackling laugh flowed with the wind. And he swore he saw a strung out junkie in the background. A tall, lanky, framed man who wore hardly any clothing. Sick boils and other pustules covering the body. He noticed a horrific smile on the face, but that was all he saw due to the hiding behind long strands of dark hair. Rick made a point to question the junkie but by the time he approached, the man had already disappeared. Rick talked with TJ about it, but this brought no closure. Then a series of cataclysmic events took place, beginning withTJ abruptly had a meeting and left his keys in Rick's car.

Rick noticed the keys later on in the night after his shift. He grabbed the set and decided to drop them off at TJ's house. That's when something caught his eye. A small gold pendant with a tiny diamond at the center. To his knowledge, TJ had never been married and as far as Rick knew, the man was not in a relationship. Granted, Rick did not interact with his partner outside of work, but thought he had enough knowledge of the man's out of work life. That night he stopped at his partners residence and left the keys in the mailbox, spying the multiple ornaments and angels decorating the lawn. At the time, he thought nothing of it and drove home. As he lay in bed, the cases rolled through the confines of his brain, and then something clicked. The pendant, he thought he had seen it before. The image refused to leave his mind to the point that sleep would not come. So Rick headed to the station super early to go through all of the dossiers on Angel Maker. The papers and pictures of those poor desecrated women littered his desk. He drank heavily from the bottle stashed in a drawer. His mind swirled, and his anger flowed like water. He slammed his fist down on the desk. Slowly, a picture slid from the pile and landed on the floor. He picked it up and scanned it. Elizabeth Colter, the first girl to be found back before the serial killer, got his name. Gutted like a deer and wrapped with garland at the front steps leading to the fountain of Boyce Park. The memories burned bright in Rick's mind, and that's when it hit him. He looked harder at the photos, and there it was. The small gold heart with the tiny diamond. He choked on the bourbon as he peered at the sight. ""Son of a bitch."" Questions and scenarios were forming and without thinking, Rick left the office and headed back to TJ's. He wasn't sure what he was gonna do but obviously his partner had tampered with evidence. Rick wouldn't stand for this. He had another thought, but prayed it wasn't true.

He pulled in the driveway, noticing that TJ's car was still gone and all the lights were off. ""Where the hell is he at four in the morning?"" Rick spoke outloud to himself as he exited his car. He walked up the steps, holster unbuttoned. His hand searched the mailbox, the keys were still inside. Without a thought, Rick unlocked the door and stepped inside.

At first, the living room seemed ordinary, but then the images of angels and Christmas decorations covered the entirety when Rick lit up his flashlight. With the murders going on, the decorations seemed morbid to him. He crept through other rooms, searching for something he was not entirely sure of what yet. Never being in this house, the landscape was unknown to the detective. Then he stopped when he heard a thud. It came from below, and then it returned quickly, followed by a muffled wine. The search of the sound brought Rick to a door near the kitchen. It had a lock on it, and as luck would have it, the key was accompanied on the keychain. Rick slowly descended to a damp and musty smelling basement. Light flickered within the brick walls, and the sounds grew louder. This is when recollection and rage flooded him. Lining the walls were clippings of the Angel Maker case. On the other side was an altar of sorts. Angels covered in red and black paint, near unlit candles were articles of jewelry. Next to the jewelry were remnants of severed fingers, some rotting and withered. His search stopped when another whimper filled the room. He jerked to the left and dropped his flashlight. In front of him was a nude woman, tied up to a blood-stained mattress. A blind fold covered her eyes and a rag over her mouth. Blood crusted her nostrils. She was squirming and crying. ""Jesus christ."" Rick whispered. He quickly ran to the girl and removed the rags. She coughed and screamed in terror. It took some time to calm her down, she spoke with hysteria, leaving nothing comprehensive. And all of the sudden foootsteps could be heard upstairs. Then the sound of TJ's voiced echoed. ""Rick? Where are you buddy?""

VI.

The flashing of blue and red lights illuminated Rick's face as he watched the girl be taken into the ambulance. The chatter of radio static and voices were all but muffled to him. The events of the last two hours were all a blur. The only thing that remained was him watching the life leave TJ's eyes as Rick strangled him to death. The bastard deserved to die in his opinion, and seeing that this case was his, it seemed only fitting that he be the one to do it. But he caught hell for this. Seeing that it was technically in self-defense and Rick had killed a serial killer, there was a gray area surrounding the case of him killing TJ. In the end, Rick was both suspended for a week and also given a pat on the back for taking out Angel Maker. He was instructed to seek mandatory therapy as well. Within that basement, police found trinkets from every victim such as pieces of their hair, severed appendages and pictures of them before and after their gruesome ends. The case had finally been solved, making Detective Rick Ellner a hero and a murderer. Poetic justice, in a sense. For the week of his suspension, Rick sat around the house, drinking and feeling a slight bit of relief. It was short-lived as he flipped through the channels of his TV. He turned it on to the news station, still discussing the melting of the polar ice caps. ""The nation continues to find large chunks of ice floating in different regions, some are found to encase"" He flipped to the next channel, and his blood ran cold. ""This is in, discovered in the backyard of the infamous serial killer, Angel Maker, formerly Detective Trevor Jameson, was the body of a young boy."" Rick listened intently and began to grind his teeth at the details. Torn clothing, deep cuts, splashed blood, dilated pupils, and the glued smile carved in the boys face. He took in the reported speculations of it being Angel Maker's final kill or the workings of a second serial killer in Allavandrel. At the time, his station had chalked up the smile murders to be part of TJ's sick game. Rick had also believed it for a moment. But there was no way. If the body had been there, it would've been discovered the day Rick strangled TJ. Unless someone else had slain the boy.

Although he couldn't interfere or help in the case, Rick knew he had to go. So he got in his car after taking a few shots of bourbon. The streets were covered in sleet with a few patches of black ice. The temperature had dropped down to the low twenties. The road swayed back and forth from the intoxication. Rick swerved, nearly hitting a parked car on the side street near TJ's neighborhood. Finally, he pulled up to the house that was swarming with police cars. The yellow tape around the yard bounced from the chill wind. The snow crunched under Rick's feet as he trudged towards the backyard. Images of the girl and TJ's dying face assaulted his thoughts. He shook off the mental displays and continued on. He crept up near the scene. It was just as described on the news report. But to see it in person was worse. It made his stomach churn to see the teenager left discarded in such a grizzly display. And that smile, that horrible smile, sent a twinge of morbidity that raised the hairs on Rick's neck. He tried to get some extra details but was reminded of his lack of involvement in the case. He huffed and turned to head back towards his car he had left running. He looked towards the trees bordering the house and paused. The deep white eyes pierced through him, and his breath shivered. It was the junkie, the same one he had been seeing periodically at the smiling crimes. ""Bastard."" Rick murmured to himself. He wasn't letting the guy get away this time. So he started walking towards the man. As he did so, the figure turned and walked in a stiff, jerking motion. The wind picked up, and the sound of laughter accompanied it. ""You think the death of a child is funny, you son of a bitch?"" The anger flowed through the Detective and he felt steam rise from his body. Something told him this guy was guilty. Due to his suspension, his gun and badge were taken away so he was unarmed. But at this point he didn't care, and he thought to himself. ""Would the world really miss another murderer?"" Rick had used his hands to remove Angel Maker so he could always repeat this if the man he was tailing was guilty.
Rick pushed beyond the snow-covered branches, barely able to see the man who was still laughing beyond. He started to jog, making sure he didn't lose the prick this time.

After a few minutes, the sounds of chatter from the crime scene faded, and all that resonated in the woods were the wind, birds, and the ominous chuckles from Rick's target. Before long, he came to a clearing. A small cubby hole in the woods that housed a few conifers and sleet covered stones. That is where the detective spied his target. The man was sitting on a rock and showing his full self. Rick spied a lanky frame, adorned with splotches of frost bite that oozed brown pus. Sections of the blues white skin had crystallized abrasions. The man wore no shoes or really any clothes. Only the petrified and stinking straps of some animal fur. The man sat motionless, a chuckle followed by a grumble. The sickly looking man was using his elongated nails to dig at an open sore. The wet sloshing of the act made Rick wince. He spat with frustration. ""Don't move, you sick bastard! Laughing at the dead? You're coming with me."" When the words faded, the figure lifted its head in a robotic motion, peering at Rick with completely white eyes, void of any emotion. Then the body rose to its feet, displaying an ungodly height. Rick had to tilt his head upwards to view this. A grimacing smile stretched from ear to ear, displaying jagged teeth of ivory. The clouds above shifted to release sunlight that created an opal shimmer on the things flesh. Rick swallowed a lump in his throat, regretting not bringing something to defend himself. Even though riddled with fear, the man stood his ground. He balled his fist, anticipating a fight with this creature. But before he could react, the thing was on him. The laughter rang in his ears as he felt the sharp nails digging into his body. The burning mixed with the unctrollable tickle to his nerves. In a strange turn of events, Rick began to laugh from the sensation. The woods were filled with the cacophony of laughter and the sound of a struggle.

On the morning of Christmas, a woman sat in her living room while two children praised all of the presents Santa had brought them. She had left the TV on for background noise when a breaking story tuned in to the latest details on the murders within the town of Allavandrel, Maine. The male news reporter read the following prompt. ""Early this morning, the body of Rick Ellner was discovered in Harbinger Woods behind Alistor Avenue. Particularly near the residence of the late Trevor Jameson, better known as the Angel Maker. Ellner was the leader investigator and partner of the recently discovered identy of the serial killer. Ellner had solved and eliminated Jameson after discovering evidence of his crimes along with a woman chained in his basement. No doubt being prepared to be the next victim. Detective Ellner was discovered with lacerations all over his torso and left in the snow. Due to the conditions of his murder, police have labeled him the latest victim of the ever growing case of Smiling Murders. More details as the story unfolds. Be careful out there, folks. Things like this are the last thing we need during this usual happy holiday. Thoughts and prayers to the family of the detective.""
The woman rolled a wedding ring attached to her necklace, looking at her children, and began to cry. The children walked over to her, oblivious to the news or their mother's tears. ""Mommy, do you think daddy will come to visit us for Christmas? Or is he still on the naughty list?""

1hmsn0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hue/comments/1hmsn0l/go_table_lamp_pulses_at_high_brightness_and/,Go Table Lamp pulses at high brightness and specific colors,"Hi there,

Noticed some strange behavior with the Hue Go Table Lamp with specific colors between 90-100% brightness while connected to power.¬†

Conditions:

1. Connected to power
2. Greater than 90% brightness
3. Color in this realm (see screenshots for a general location in the color wheel):
   1. hs\_color: 23.333, 42.353
   2. rgb\_color: 255, 189, 147
   3. xy\_color: 0.4509, 0.364

  
The lamp seems to slightly pulse a few times in a row, stabilize, and then do it again, over and over. It‚Äôs very smooth so it‚Äôs sometimes hard to notice. The pattern is slightly different every time, that is, it‚Äôs not always 3 times in a row and then stops, or something like that. The color can also be static, it doesn‚Äôt need to be a dynamic scene. Just anything near the color mentioned already.

Weirdly, this does *not* happen if the lamp is at 100% power but running off the battery.

I noticed this because I like the Morning Coffee dynamic scene built into the lamp, and when cycling through specific colors at 100% brightness, it would start pulsing. I also have a custom dynamic scene for the whole room that has the colors in Morning Coffee and it does it with that scene, too.

But, again, only while connected to mains power. My other hue gos (the bowl-shaped ones) do not do this, and neither do any other lamps or lights from Hue that run through the same colors. It is just this.

Can anyone confirm with their Go Table Lamp this behavior with the criteria listed above?

The chilling arctic wind nipped at the exposed cheeks of a boy, accompanied by his uncle, father, and dog. The chilling breeze whistled past the individuals as the deep snow crunched beneath their feet. Furs and leathers were doubled in layers, thick straps utilized to create a tight fit to block out the cold. ""How much further?"" The young boy asked, chattering his teeth between each word. There was no answer for some time before his uncle stopped and knelt down to face him. ""We are almost on its trail. We have to be careful and silent. If it hears us approaching, we could be next."" The boy nodded and stifled the fear welling up inside of him. Footsteps continued, and the dog pounced through the snow, occasionally pausing to sniff the air. A strong vortex picked up, and the animal let out a deep growl. It gnashed its teeth towards the flurry of snow that was getting heavier. The group stopped, watching the dogs actions. Hand signals were used. Unfortunately, the boy had no idea what they meant. Soon, a sound crept into their ears. It started off soft, barely a murmur until it reached a crescendo that rivaled the wind. It was laughter. The eerie tone of it sent a chill to run down the boy's spine.

The chime was hollow and emotionless. It returned in waves of threes. The hair on the dogs back stood up, and it spun towards the group. Foaming saliva rolled from the gleaming teeth, turning to ice from the harsh weather. It barked and then lunged towards the boy. In a flash of quick movements, blood spattered on the fresh snow, followed by the final yelp of the rabid creature. The boy's father stood motionless, still clutching the spear he had used to stop the dog. ""It's here."" The man spoke without removing his gaze from the animal. The spear was removed, and they continued forward. Waves of laughter returned but more profound this time. The boy was instructed to cover his ears. He did so and followed the adults until they came upon footprints. Large prints of barefeet trudged through frozen layers of dark blood. Drag marks followed each foot as if something was being pulled at each side of the wanderer. Fear bubbled up through the boy, and he shivered. The act was not from the cold but the agonizing terror of the thing they pursued.

Menacing chuckles followed with the wind, and the boy pressed harder against his frigid ears. The sound was muffled but still apparent. He looked down towards his feet, occasionally spying more of those massive bloodied footprints. Before long, he ran into the still frame of his father. No words were spoken or hand gestures utilized. Instead, the boys father grunted and nodded his head. The pulsing heart inside the boy's body skipped a beat when his eyes fell upon what had caused the ceasing of motion. Towards a frost covered boulder, stood a man. Not an ordinary man by any means. This man was deathly thin with pale skin that had an opalescent sheen. Ice crystals covered countless areas of the abrasive flesh along with purple and black splotches of frostbite. Aside from the bits of tattered and rotting furs, the body was exposed to the elements. Long strands of frozen hair dangled in front of a gaunt face. Barely visible through the locks of obsidian were a set of unblinking eyes. Wide and without pupils, the things scanned the white landscape. A crooked smile stretched across cracked, blue lips. A long stream of brown liquid stained the corners and dripped over the jawline. 

The things head looked left, then right before kneeling down. That horrible laugh spewed from the sinister mouth. The thing began to fumble with something at its feet. The three stood there in awe, trying to ascertain what it was doing. Realization took over in the form of the boy gasping. Tears dropped and froze to his skin as he cried at the sight of his dead mother and sister. Their corpses tangled together in a small pool of blood. Their furs had large rips, exposing torn flesh. The most horrific part was there still open eyes, accompanied by the same smile as the thing that took them. The mystery of their fates had been discovered in the worst possible way. Chomping and slurping comensed as the wretched thing began to eat the remnants of the two women. The boy clinched his teeth and tried to hold back the wailing but to no avail. He let out a cry that caught the attention of the emaciated creature. The boy's uncle quickly cupped his mouth. ""Hush. You need to be quiet."" But it was too late. The creature had stopped its feast and jerked its head forward. Blood oozed from the grinning mouth, and it stood up.

There was no time to plan, only attack. The boys father let out a war cry and charged towards the thing, spear gripped in both hands. The second adult followed suit after instructing the boy to remain at his spot. The men charged towards the scrawny and menacing ice demin. The charging hastened until all three crashed with a thud. The spear missed its target, the father was knocked back, and the uncle was lifted from the ground with a bony hand. The laughing echoed in the dry air. The creature's free hand rose and spread a set of five abnormally long fingers with deep black nails at the end. The next few moments are blurry due to the child covering his face. But in the end, his uncle was dead and bloody, a large smile etched on his lifeless face. The boys father fought with all his might but also lost. The scuffle and weight of the three bodies caused a large crack to form below their feet. None aware of the fact they they stood on a thick slab of ice. The cracking grew louder until a hole gave way, sending the boys father and the monster jolting towards the icy depths. The boy sat in fright as he watched his father sink. His heart thumped in his chest at the loss. However, the worst sight was that of the pale face, slowly sinking into the abyss. Those white eyes pierced through the frozen locks of hair. Its laugh seeped through the display of sharp teeth that echoed until it finally broke the waters edge, leaving the boy all alone in the desolate cold.

II.

The glowing numbers of the alarm clock shifted from 6:59 to 7:00, and the voice of Burl Ives rang through its speaker, telling the world to have a Holly Jolly Christmas. ""God damnit! Shut up!"" Screamed the already annoyed man who quickly sat up his bed. He jammed his thumb into the off button and got to his feet. ""God, I hate this shit."" He spoke to himself while putting on his pants and walking to his dresser. A bottle of whiskey was snatched up, and the lid was removed. The man grabbed the glass next to it and poured the brown liquid, then swallowed the whole thing in one gulp. The sting of the alcohol caused a wince, then warmth took over as it slowly made its way down to the man's stomach. He put on a shirt and then stepped out of the bedroom. A loud ringing echoed in the hallway, which sent the man speed walking towards it. He lifted the recieve and spoke in a harsh voice. ""Yea?"" Another voice came from the other end. ""Rick. He's back."" The man holding the phone raised an eyebrow. ""Who's back?"" There was not a moment of pause with the response. ""Angel maker."" Anger welled up in the man, and he snorted. ""Give me the address, and I'll be there as soon as I can."" He wrote down the info on a sticky note and hastily got ready.

With the turning of a key, the car purred to life. The winter air left a trail of steam to rise from the tail pipe. The vehicle sped off, and the anxious man, better known as Detective Rick Ellner, was headed towards what was most likely another twisted gift from a demented giver. Rick drove through the frost covered streets of the town he had grown up in his whole life. Snow shifting lazily with the slight breeze in the air. Christmas lights were on display but not lit, wreaths and trees set up, images of Santa, and periodically he saw children building snowmen. All of the things he loathed this time of year. When most people think of Christmas, they associate the holiday with joy, family, and happiness. For Rick, it only meant sorrow, regret, anger, and solitude. This would mark the third year of a dreadful season. His thoughts harkened back to his wife and children. Their faces, smiling and displaying those soft, happy eyes. Then, the mood shifted into tears, screaming and crying. The reel of images morphed from scene to scene until it landed on the monstrous displays of desecrated bodies. All sprawled out in the snow, covered in blood and lascerations. Angel Maker, the name coined for a heartless lunatic who had sent a plague of fear to infect the town of Allavandrel. Bodies tore open, stuffed with Yule tide trinkets of all sorts. Blood coated their bodies and left to freeze in the cold. These corpses all had been manipulated in the snow to create wings beneath them. Hence, the name published in tabloids and news bulletins.

This had been Rick's obsession ever since he was called to the first case. The lifeless body of a fifteen year old girl left him feeling dead inside. This spanned a total of nine other victims, all left in the same manner. No clues found, no murder weapon. There was nothing to link a culprit to these heinous acts of violence. The work spilled into his home life, which in turn led him to becoming an alcoholic. The liquor morphed Rick into an abusive, neglectful terror within the walls of his home. Instead of finding the serial killer, he took his frustration out on his family. After the fifth broken bone, his wife divorced him and took the kids without warning. A week before Christmas. Since then, the lonesome detective had zero contact with his children and didn't even know where they went. Instead of sobering up and trying to make amends, Rick spiraled deeper into his bottle and spent every waking moment plotting his suicide. However, in reality, he was a coward and could never bring himself to pull the trigger. So instead, he wasted away on boose and obsessing over the elusive creator of bloodied snow angels. The case went cold after the ninth week. Two things were maintained with this sadistic bastard, his MO, and his pattern. After the first snow, a body would be found in a public place, and each week, another would arrive until the body count reached that magic number , and Angel Maker would dissappear. The monster had returned with the cold once again, and Rick was determined to get his guy this time. 

III.

Rick pulled up to the edge of Boyce Park. A crowd had already formed near the caution tape. The radio in his car was blaring a news report. ""Despite the freezing temperatures, the polar ice caps continue to melt, sending waves of water and huge chunks of ice..."" Rick turned the car off and stepped out.

He pushed his way past people, completely ignoring the relentless news reporter who had received a broken jaw from the last time he attempted to interview Rick last year. Once past the tape and local police officers, Rick's partner shuffled towards him. ""Bout damn time you got here! The bastard changed things up with this one."" The stocky frame of Detective Trevor Jameson, or TJ for short, whisked Rick hurriedly towards the crime scene. In a distasteful display of savagery lay the remains of a young woman. She was posed flat on the snow, the form of an angel beneath her, coated in blood. No clothing covered the body, showing the gaping slash in the woman's abdomen that expelled frozen entrails wrapped up in the shape of a bow. Christmas lights were wrapped around her neck, which had also been slashed open. The usually leavings of Rick's bane of existence. But this time, something was different.

""Female, early twenties, maybe younger. As usual, her throat and stomach were slashed. As we expected, Angel maker left his signature symbol and decorated the body. But this time it's different, take a look."" Rick followed the hand his partner pointed with to view the face. The poor woman's eyes were gone and replaced with pieces of a shattered mirror. Wedged in viciously. ""Sick son of a bitch."" Rick muttered under his breath. TJ gave further details then ended with the question of what the mirrored eyes meant. No real answer was given. Instead, Rick scanned the scene, noticing that only one set of foot prints were present. A set of two right at the womans feet, as if the killer stood there to admire his work. Another repititious detail from prior murders. In the past, molds had been made to get a print for whatever shoes were worn but nothing ever came through. Upon further inspection, it was noted that a section of hair was removed along with her pinky finger. This was not new because Angel Maker always took a piece of his victims, except this time he took two articles. A year had already passed since the last string of murders and this one occurred on the exact same day as previous years but felt different in ways. Rick told himself that this would be the end of the sick bastard. Eventually, the two men left the scene to escape the cold and get coffee to further discuss the newest addition to the list of slain women. 

The victim followed the exact same circumstances as the others. Esteemed and loved individual who had been kidnapped out of the blue from another state to be found sometime later, disgraced and mutiliated by the hands of Allavandrel's infamous serial killer. Every victim hailed from neighboring states and would later be dumped in Maine. The first one of the year was always left in a public place for all to see. The others left in more obscure regions of town. But they all maintained their locations in this specific town. That detail led the authorities to believe Angel Maker was a native of Allavandrel. But since the beginning of the crimes, no suspects or evidence whatsoever had been found. Rick pondered on this as he stirred the spoon in his coffee. TJ continued discussing the case, all details going in one ear and out the other for Rick. That was until his partner pointed out that this new girl was found only ten yards from the very first victim. Rick had been so focused on the body that he hadn't realized the location. That night he stayed up late with a bottle of Jack and the case files from Angel Maker's first appearance. The tumblers were rolling in Rick's head and his focus was at full force towards finding the deranged psychopath. 

IV. 

A week had passed since the discovery of the woman found in Boyce Park, and Rick had yet to find any new details. His stress was rising, especially after another victim was found, courtesy of his enemy. The second bloody snow angel was found near Olive Creek, which Rick realized was the same as the second victim from the first year of Angel Maker. The only difference was that this new woman was on the opposite edge of the water. This unfortunate soul also had an organ replaced. Her heart was ripped out, and in its place was a glass tree ornament in the shape of a cartoon heart. The shiny object reflected the angered face of Rick. ""God damnit. How did no one see anything?!"" Tj placed a hand on his shoulder. ""I don't know, Rick. We're just lucky I was out on a stroll and found her. We're gonna get him this time."" The cold breeze picked up and assaulted Rick's face. He shook it off and got back to his feet. ""Let's go, TJ. We need to go through the files. If he's repeating his first kills, then we know where the next girl will be."" TJ lagged behind, but soon the two were both in the car. They made their way to the station, the radio giving another bulletin. ""More and more melted water is causing floods near"" Static chirped to interrupt the announcers voice, then it returned. ""Large chunks of ice have drifted towards areas such as"" Just then, the cb radio cracked to life. ""Detective Ellner, please respond to a code J Zero One"" Without hesitation, Rick picked up the radio receiver. ""This is Ellner, We're on it. Location?"" Instantly, the two thought another Angel Maker scene, even though it was too soon. Their thoughts changed when they made it to the outskirts of town.

Near the welcome sign of Allavandrel, crumpled in the fetal position was a body. The sight of the corpse was not accompanied by an angelic figure of snow. The individual was fully clothed, save for the large gashes, and cuts around the back and chest area. No major wounds, replaced organs or Christmas decor. The victim was male, which had never been part of Angel Maker's selected victims. Several questions filled the minds of the detectives as they knelt down to examine the scene. Blood was frozen to the fabric and snow, and deep cuts. The wounds were not deep enough to cause death, however. Once photos were taken and the body was able to be moved, a gasp escaped the coroner. Rick and TJ looked, and both men raised an eyebrow. Then TJ muttered softly. ""What in the hell?"" Stetched across the dead man's face was a ghastly smile. The corners of his mouth were cracked, showing every tooth that was stained with a brown sludge. The eyes were wide open but lacked any color except for the enlarged pupils. It was grotesque, and the face looked more like a Halloween mask than a flesh and blood face. The body was placed in a bag and hauled off to the station. 

Rick went home around two in the morning, scratching his head at what the new crime was. Could Angel Maker have chosen to change his tactics? Could the monster have decided to grab an extra kill? The last question he asked himself really sent his stomach to his feet. Was there another serial killer loose in town? Rick's mind swirled with questions and theories, but nothing gave answers or any clarity. The only solution he found was at the bottom of a liquor bottle. Two days later, another smiling corpse was found. It resembled the same pattern as the first, but only this time, it was an elderly woman. Tj was on a different call, so Rick was alone during his examination. The look of the smiling, decrepit face left him feeling uneasy. The more he focused on it, the more melancholy it became. Then, out of nowhere, a sound flooded his hears. A low murmur of a laugh. Dry and emotionless, like that of morbid sarcasm. It tickled his ear, and he looked in all directions but did not find the owner of the ominous laugh. He thought his mind was playing tricks on him. But as he left the scene, the wind blew, and the hollow chuckle accompanied it. 

V.

It was two weeks before Christmas, and in that time, three more girls were discovered along with four more smiling bodies. To add to the unease and frustration, sting operations had been placed in hopes of catching Angel Maker. The latest bodies were all found near the same areas as the first appearanceof Allavandrel'sserial killer. But even though multiple squad cars sat for reconicenese, there were no sightings. It was only after the authorities left the scene that the bodies were discovered. As if Angel Maker was watching and knew the police were waiting. Things were getting strange, and it left more questions than answers. Even stranger was that Rick noticed that his partner was always either the one to discover them or the first on scene. Then there were the smiling faces of the dead found in the outskirts of town that slowly reached the main hub of Allavandrel. Rick thought he was losing his mind because every body he examined, that dry, crackling laugh flowed with the wind. And he swore he saw a strung out junkie in the background. A tall, lanky, framed man who wore hardly any clothing. Sick boils and other pustules covering the body. He noticed a horrific smile on the face, but that was all he saw due to the hiding behind long strands of dark hair. Rick made a point to question the junkie but by the time he approached, the man had already disappeared. Rick talked with TJ about it, but this brought no closure. Then a series of cataclysmic events took place, beginning withTJ abruptly had a meeting and left his keys in Rick's car.

Rick noticed the keys later on in the night after his shift. He grabbed the set and decided to drop them off at TJ's house. That's when something caught his eye. A small gold pendant with a tiny diamond at the center. To his knowledge, TJ had never been married and as far as Rick knew, the man was not in a relationship. Granted, Rick did not interact with his partner outside of work, but thought he had enough knowledge of the man's out of work life. That night he stopped at his partners residence and left the keys in the mailbox, spying the multiple ornaments and angels decorating the lawn. At the time, he thought nothing of it and drove home. As he lay in bed, the cases rolled through the confines of his brain, and then something clicked. The pendant, he thought he had seen it before. The image refused to leave his mind to the point that sleep would not come. So Rick headed to the station super early to go through all of the dossiers on Angel Maker. The papers and pictures of those poor desecrated women littered his desk. He drank heavily from the bottle stashed in a drawer. His mind swirled, and his anger flowed like water. He slammed his fist down on the desk. Slowly, a picture slid from the pile and landed on the floor. He picked it up and scanned it. Elizabeth Colter, the first girl to be found back before the serial killer, got his name. Gutted like a deer and wrapped with garland at the front steps leading to the fountain of Boyce Park. The memories burned bright in Rick's mind, and that's when it hit him. He looked harder at the photos, and there it was. The small gold heart with the tiny diamond. He choked on the bourbon as he peered at the sight. ""Son of a bitch."" Questions and scenarios were forming and without thinking, Rick left the office and headed back to TJ's. He wasn't sure what he was gonna do but obviously his partner had tampered with evidence. Rick wouldn't stand for this. He had another thought, but prayed it wasn't true.

He pulled in the driveway, noticing that TJ's car was still gone and all the lights were off. ""Where the hell is he at four in the morning?"" Rick spoke outloud to himself as he exited his car. He walked up the steps, holster unbuttoned. His hand searched the mailbox, the keys were still inside. Without a thought, Rick unlocked the door and stepped inside.

At first, the living room seemed ordinary, but then the images of angels and Christmas decorations covered the entirety when Rick lit up his flashlight. With the murders going on, the decorations seemed morbid to him. He crept through other rooms, searching for something he was not entirely sure of what yet. Never being in this house, the landscape was unknown to the detective. Then he stopped when he heard a thud. It came from below, and then it returned quickly, followed by a muffled wine. The search of the sound brought Rick to a door near the kitchen. It had a lock on it, and as luck would have it, the key was accompanied on the keychain. Rick slowly descended to a damp and musty smelling basement. Light flickered within the brick walls, and the sounds grew louder. This is when recollection and rage flooded him. Lining the walls were clippings of the Angel Maker case. On the other side was an altar of sorts. Angels covered in red and black paint, near unlit candles were articles of jewelry. Next to the jewelry were remnants of severed fingers, some rotting and withered. His search stopped when another whimper filled the room. He jerked to the left and dropped his flashlight. In front of him was a nude woman, tied up to a blood-stained mattress. A blind fold covered her eyes and a rag over her mouth. Blood crusted her nostrils. She was squirming and crying. ""Jesus christ."" Rick whispered. He quickly ran to the girl and removed the rags. She coughed and screamed in terror. It took some time to calm her down, she spoke with hysteria, leaving nothing comprehensive. And all of the sudden foootsteps could be heard upstairs. Then the sound of TJ's voiced echoed. ""Rick? Where are you buddy?""

VI.

The flashing of blue and red lights illuminated Rick's face as he watched the girl be taken into the ambulance. The chatter of radio static and voices were all but muffled to him. The events of the last two hours were all a blur. The only thing that remained was him watching the life leave TJ's eyes as Rick strangled him to death. The bastard deserved to die in his opinion, and seeing that this case was his, it seemed only fitting that he be the one to do it. But he caught hell for this. Seeing that it was technically in self-defense and Rick had killed a serial killer, there was a gray area surrounding the case of him killing TJ. In the end, Rick was both suspended for a week and also given a pat on the back for taking out Angel Maker. He was instructed to seek mandatory therapy as well. Within that basement, police found trinkets from every victim such as pieces of their hair, severed appendages and pictures of them before and after their gruesome ends. The case had finally been solved, making Detective Rick Ellner a hero and a murderer. Poetic justice, in a sense. For the week of his suspension, Rick sat around the house, drinking and feeling a slight bit of relief. It was short-lived as he flipped through the channels of his TV. He turned it on to the news station, still discussing the melting of the polar ice caps. ""The nation continues to find large chunks of ice floating in different regions, some are found to encase"" He flipped to the next channel, and his blood ran cold. ""This is in, discovered in the backyard of the infamous serial killer, Angel Maker, formerly Detective Trevor Jameson, was the body of a young boy."" Rick listened intently and began to grind his teeth at the details. Torn clothing, deep cuts, splashed blood, dilated pupils, and the glued smile carved in the boys face. He took in the reported speculations of it being Angel Maker's final kill or the workings of a second serial killer in Allavandrel. At the time, his station had chalked up the smile murders to be part of TJ's sick game. Rick had also believed it for a moment. But there was no way. If the body had been there, it would've been discovered the day Rick strangled TJ. Unless someone else had slain the boy.

Although he couldn't interfere or help in the case, Rick knew he had to go. So he got in his car after taking a few shots of bourbon. The streets were covered in sleet with a few patches of black ice. The temperature had dropped down to the low twenties. The road swayed back and forth from the intoxication. Rick swerved, nearly hitting a parked car on the side street near TJ's neighborhood. Finally, he pulled up to the house that was swarming with police cars. The yellow tape around the yard bounced from the chill wind. The snow crunched under Rick's feet as he trudged towards the backyard. Images of the girl and TJ's dying face assaulted his thoughts. He shook off the mental displays and continued on. He crept up near the scene. It was just as described on the news report. But to see it in person was worse. It made his stomach churn to see the teenager left discarded in such a grizzly display. And that smile, that horrible smile, sent a twinge of morbidity that raised the hairs on Rick's neck. He tried to get some extra details but was reminded of his lack of involvement in the case. He huffed and turned to head back towards his car he had left running. He looked towards the trees bordering the house and paused. The deep white eyes pierced through him, and his breath shivered. It was the junkie, the same one he had been seeing periodically at the smiling crimes. ""Bastard."" Rick murmured to himself. He wasn't letting the guy get away this time. So he started walking towards the man. As he did so, the figure turned and walked in a stiff, jerking motion. The wind picked up, and the sound of laughter accompanied it. ""You think the death of a child is funny, you son of a bitch?"" The anger flowed through the Detective and he felt steam rise from his body. Something told him this guy was guilty. Due to his suspension, his gun and badge were taken away so he was unarmed. But at this point he didn't care, and he thought to himself. ""Would the world really miss another murderer?"" Rick had used his hands to remove Angel Maker so he could always repeat this if the man he was tailing was guilty.
Rick pushed beyond the snow-covered branches, barely able to see the man who was still laughing beyond. He started to jog, making sure he didn't lose the prick this time.

After a few minutes, the sounds of chatter from the crime scene faded, and all that resonated in the woods were the wind, birds, and the ominous chuckles from Rick's target. Before long, he came to a clearing. A small cubby hole in the woods that housed a few conifers and sleet covered stones. That is where the detective spied his target. The man was sitting on a rock and showing his full self. Rick spied a lanky frame, adorned with splotches of frost bite that oozed brown pus. Sections of the blues white skin had crystallized abrasions. The man wore no shoes or really any clothes. Only the petrified and stinking straps of some animal fur. The man sat motionless, a chuckle followed by a grumble. The sickly looking man was using his elongated nails to dig at an open sore. The wet sloshing of the act made Rick wince. He spat with frustration. ""Don't move, you sick bastard! Laughing at the dead? You're coming with me."" When the words faded, the figure lifted its head in a robotic motion, peering at Rick with completely white eyes, void of any emotion. Then the body rose to its feet, displaying an ungodly height. Rick had to tilt his head upwards to view this. A grimacing smile stretched from ear to ear, displaying jagged teeth of ivory. The clouds above shifted to release sunlight that created an opal shimmer on the things flesh. Rick swallowed a lump in his throat, regretting not bringing something to defend himself. Even though riddled with fear, the man stood his ground. He balled his fist, anticipating a fight with this creature. But before he could react, the thing was on him. The laughter rang in his ears as he felt the sharp nails digging into his body. The burning mixed with the unctrollable tickle to his nerves. In a strange turn of events, Rick began to laugh from the sensation. The woods were filled with the cacophony of laughter and the sound of a struggle.

On the morning of Christmas, a woman sat in her living room while two children praised all of the presents Santa had brought them. She had left the TV on for background noise when a breaking story tuned in to the latest details on the murders within the town of Allavandrel, Maine. The male news reporter read the following prompt. ""Early this morning, the body of Rick Ellner was discovered in Harbinger Woods behind Alistor Avenue. Particularly near the residence of the late Trevor Jameson, better known as the Angel Maker. Ellner was the leader investigator and partner of the recently discovered identy of the serial killer. Ellner had solved and eliminated Jameson after discovering evidence of his crimes along with a woman chained in his basement. No doubt being prepared to be the next victim. Detective Ellner was discovered with lacerations all over his torso and left in the snow. Due to the conditions of his murder, police have labeled him the latest victim of the ever growing case of Smiling Murders. More details as the story unfolds. Be careful out there, folks. Things like this are the last thing we need during this usual happy holiday. Thoughts and prayers to the family of the detective.""
The woman rolled a wedding ring attached to her necklace, looking at her children, and began to cry. The children walked over to her, oblivious to the news or their mother's tears. ""Mommy, do you think daddy will come to visit us for Christmas? Or is he still on the naughty list?""

The chilling arctic wind nipped at the exposed cheeks of a boy, accompanied by his uncle, father, and dog. The chilling breeze whistled past the individuals as the deep snow crunched beneath their feet. Furs and leathers were doubled in layers, thick straps utilized to create a tight fit to block out the cold. ""How much further?"" The young boy asked, chattering his teeth between each word. There was no answer for some time before his uncle stopped and knelt down to face him. ""We are almost on its trail. We have to be careful and silent. If it hears us approaching, we could be next."" The boy nodded and stifled the fear welling up inside of him. Footsteps continued, and the dog pounced through the snow, occasionally pausing to sniff the air. A strong vortex picked up, and the animal let out a deep growl. It gnashed its teeth towards the flurry of snow that was getting heavier. The group stopped, watching the dogs actions. Hand signals were used. Unfortunately, the boy had no idea what they meant. Soon, a sound crept into their ears. It started off soft, barely a murmur until it reached a crescendo that rivaled the wind. It was laughter. The eerie tone of it sent a chill to run down the boy's spine.

The chime was hollow and emotionless. It returned in waves of threes. The hair on the dogs back stood up, and it spun towards the group. Foaming saliva rolled from the gleaming teeth, turning to ice from the harsh weather. It barked and then lunged towards the boy. In a flash of quick movements, blood spattered on the fresh snow, followed by the final yelp of the rabid creature. The boy's father stood motionless, still clutching the spear he had used to stop the dog. ""It's here."" The man spoke without removing his gaze from the animal. The spear was removed, and they continued forward. Waves of laughter returned but more profound this time. The boy was instructed to cover his ears. He did so and followed the adults until they came upon footprints. Large prints of barefeet trudged through frozen layers of dark blood. Drag marks followed each foot as if something was being pulled at each side of the wanderer. Fear bubbled up through the boy, and he shivered. The act was not from the cold but the agonizing terror of the thing they pursued.

Menacing chuckles followed with the wind, and the boy pressed harder against his frigid ears. The sound was muffled but still apparent. He looked down towards his feet, occasionally spying more of those massive bloodied footprints. Before long, he ran into the still frame of his father. No words were spoken or hand gestures utilized. Instead, the boys father grunted and nodded his head. The pulsing heart inside the boy's body skipped a beat when his eyes fell upon what had caused the ceasing of motion. Towards a frost covered boulder, stood a man. Not an ordinary man by any means. This man was deathly thin with pale skin that had an opalescent sheen. Ice crystals covered countless areas of the abrasive flesh along with purple and black splotches of frostbite. Aside from the bits of tattered and rotting furs, the body was exposed to the elements. Long strands of frozen hair dangled in front of a gaunt face. Barely visible through the locks of obsidian were a set of unblinking eyes. Wide and without pupils, the things scanned the white landscape. A crooked smile stretched across cracked, blue lips. A long stream of brown liquid stained the corners and dripped over the jawline. 

The things head looked left, then right before kneeling down. That horrible laugh spewed from the sinister mouth. The thing began to fumble with something at its feet. The three stood there in awe, trying to ascertain what it was doing. Realization took over in the form of the boy gasping. Tears dropped and froze to his skin as he cried at the sight of his dead mother and sister. Their corpses tangled together in a small pool of blood. Their furs had large rips, exposing torn flesh. The most horrific part was there still open eyes, accompanied by the same smile as the thing that took them. The mystery of their fates had been discovered in the worst possible way. Chomping and slurping comensed as the wretched thing began to eat the remnants of the two women. The boy clinched his teeth and tried to hold back the wailing but to no avail. He let out a cry that caught the attention of the emaciated creature. The boy's uncle quickly cupped his mouth. ""Hush. You need to be quiet."" But it was too late. The creature had stopped its feast and jerked its head forward. Blood oozed from the grinning mouth, and it stood up.

There was no time to plan, only attack. The boys father let out a war cry and charged towards the thing, spear gripped in both hands. The second adult followed suit after instructing the boy to remain at his spot. The men charged towards the scrawny and menacing ice demin. The charging hastened until all three crashed with a thud. The spear missed its target, the father was knocked back, and the uncle was lifted from the ground with a bony hand. The laughing echoed in the dry air. The creature's free hand rose and spread a set of five abnormally long fingers with deep black nails at the end. The next few moments are blurry due to the child covering his face. But in the end, his uncle was dead and bloody, a large smile etched on his lifeless face. The boys father fought with all his might but also lost. The scuffle and weight of the three bodies caused a large crack to form below their feet. None aware of the fact they they stood on a thick slab of ice. The cracking grew louder until a hole gave way, sending the boys father and the monster jolting towards the icy depths. The boy sat in fright as he watched his father sink. His heart thumped in his chest at the loss. However, the worst sight was that of the pale face, slowly sinking into the abyss. Those white eyes pierced through the frozen locks of hair. Its laugh seeped through the display of sharp teeth that echoed until it finally broke the waters edge, leaving the boy all alone in the desolate cold.

II.

The glowing numbers of the alarm clock shifted from 6:59 to 7:00, and the voice of Burl Ives rang through its speaker, telling the world to have a Holly Jolly Christmas. ""God damnit! Shut up!"" Screamed the already annoyed man who quickly sat up his bed. He jammed his thumb into the off button and got to his feet. ""God, I hate this shit."" He spoke to himself while putting on his pants and walking to his dresser. A bottle of whiskey was snatched up, and the lid was removed. The man grabbed the glass next to it and poured the brown liquid, then swallowed the whole thing in one gulp. The sting of the alcohol caused a wince, then warmth took over as it slowly made its way down to the man's stomach. He put on a shirt and then stepped out of the bedroom. A loud ringing echoed in the hallway, which sent the man speed walking towards it. He lifted the recieve and spoke in a harsh voice. ""Yea?"" Another voice came from the other end. ""Rick. He's back."" The man holding the phone raised an eyebrow. ""Who's back?"" There was not a moment of pause with the response. ""Angel maker."" Anger welled up in the man, and he snorted. ""Give me the address, and I'll be there as soon as I can."" He wrote down the info on a sticky note and hastily got ready.

With the turning of a key, the car purred to life. The winter air left a trail of steam to rise from the tail pipe. The vehicle sped off, and the anxious man, better known as Detective Rick Ellner, was headed towards what was most likely another twisted gift from a demented giver. Rick drove through the frost covered streets of the town he had grown up in his whole life. Snow shifting lazily with the slight breeze in the air. Christmas lights were on display but not lit, wreaths and trees set up, images of Santa, and periodically he saw children building snowmen. All of the things he loathed this time of year. When most people think of Christmas, they associate the holiday with joy, family, and happiness. For Rick, it only meant sorrow, regret, anger, and solitude. This would mark the third year of a dreadful season. His thoughts harkened back to his wife and children. Their faces, smiling and displaying those soft, happy eyes. Then, the mood shifted into tears, screaming and crying. The reel of images morphed from scene to scene until it landed on the monstrous displays of desecrated bodies. All sprawled out in the snow, covered in blood and lascerations. Angel Maker, the name coined for a heartless lunatic who had sent a plague of fear to infect the town of Allavandrel. Bodies tore open, stuffed with Yule tide trinkets of all sorts. Blood coated their bodies and left to freeze in the cold. These corpses all had been manipulated in the snow to create wings beneath them. Hence, the name published in tabloids and news bulletins.

This had been Rick's obsession ever since he was called to the first case. The lifeless body of a fifteen year old girl left him feeling dead inside. This spanned a total of nine other victims, all left in the same manner. No clues found, no murder weapon. There was nothing to link a culprit to these heinous acts of violence. The work spilled into his home life, which in turn led him to becoming an alcoholic. The liquor morphed Rick into an abusive, neglectful terror within the walls of his home. Instead of finding the serial killer, he took his frustration out on his family. After the fifth broken bone, his wife divorced him and took the kids without warning. A week before Christmas. Since then, the lonesome detective had zero contact with his children and didn't even know where they went. Instead of sobering up and trying to make amends, Rick spiraled deeper into his bottle and spent every waking moment plotting his suicide. However, in reality, he was a coward and could never bring himself to pull the trigger. So instead, he wasted away on boose and obsessing over the elusive creator of bloodied snow angels. The case went cold after the ninth week. Two things were maintained with this sadistic bastard, his MO, and his pattern. After the first snow, a body would be found in a public place, and each week, another would arrive until the body count reached that magic number , and Angel Maker would dissappear. The monster had returned with the cold once again, and Rick was determined to get his guy this time. 

III.

Rick pulled up to the edge of Boyce Park. A crowd had already formed near the caution tape. The radio in his car was blaring a news report. ""Despite the freezing temperatures, the polar ice caps continue to melt, sending waves of water and huge chunks of ice..."" Rick turned the car off and stepped out.

He pushed his way past people, completely ignoring the relentless news reporter who had received a broken jaw from the last time he attempted to interview Rick last year. Once past the tape and local police officers, Rick's partner shuffled towards him. ""Bout damn time you got here! The bastard changed things up with this one."" The stocky frame of Detective Trevor Jameson, or TJ for short, whisked Rick hurriedly towards the crime scene. In a distasteful display of savagery lay the remains of a young woman. She was posed flat on the snow, the form of an angel beneath her, coated in blood. No clothing covered the body, showing the gaping slash in the woman's abdomen that expelled frozen entrails wrapped up in the shape of a bow. Christmas lights were wrapped around her neck, which had also been slashed open. The usually leavings of Rick's bane of existence. But this time, something was different.

""Female, early twenties, maybe younger. As usual, her throat and stomach were slashed. As we expected, Angel maker left his signature symbol and decorated the body. But this time it's different, take a look."" Rick followed the hand his partner pointed with to view the face. The poor woman's eyes were gone and replaced with pieces of a shattered mirror. Wedged in viciously. ""Sick son of a bitch."" Rick muttered under his breath. TJ gave further details then ended with the question of what the mirrored eyes meant. No real answer was given. Instead, Rick scanned the scene, noticing that only one set of foot prints were present. A set of two right at the womans feet, as if the killer stood there to admire his work. Another repititious detail from prior murders. In the past, molds had been made to get a print for whatever shoes were worn but nothing ever came through. Upon further inspection, it was noted that a section of hair was removed along with her pinky finger. This was not new because Angel Maker always took a piece of his victims, except this time he took two articles. A year had already passed since the last string of murders and this one occurred on the exact same day as previous years but felt different in ways. Rick told himself that this would be the end of the sick bastard. Eventually, the two men left the scene to escape the cold and get coffee to further discuss the newest addition to the list of slain women. 

The victim followed the exact same circumstances as the others. Esteemed and loved individual who had been kidnapped out of the blue from another state to be found sometime later, disgraced and mutiliated by the hands of Allavandrel's infamous serial killer. Every victim hailed from neighboring states and would later be dumped in Maine. The first one of the year was always left in a public place for all to see. The others left in more obscure regions of town. But they all maintained their locations in this specific town. That detail led the authorities to believe Angel Maker was a native of Allavandrel. But since the beginning of the crimes, no suspects or evidence whatsoever had been found. Rick pondered on this as he stirred the spoon in his coffee. TJ continued discussing the case, all details going in one ear and out the other for Rick. That was until his partner pointed out that this new girl was found only ten yards from the very first victim. Rick had been so focused on the body that he hadn't realized the location. That night he stayed up late with a bottle of Jack and the case files from Angel Maker's first appearance. The tumblers were rolling in Rick's head and his focus was at full force towards finding the deranged psychopath. 

IV. 

A week had passed since the discovery of the woman found in Boyce Park, and Rick had yet to find any new details. His stress was rising, especially after another victim was found, courtesy of his enemy. The second bloody snow angel was found near Olive Creek, which Rick realized was the same as the second victim from the first year of Angel Maker. The only difference was that this new woman was on the opposite edge of the water. This unfortunate soul also had an organ replaced. Her heart was ripped out, and in its place was a glass tree ornament in the shape of a cartoon heart. The shiny object reflected the angered face of Rick. ""God damnit. How did no one see anything?!"" Tj placed a hand on his shoulder. ""I don't know, Rick. We're just lucky I was out on a stroll and found her. We're gonna get him this time."" The cold breeze picked up and assaulted Rick's face. He shook it off and got back to his feet. ""Let's go, TJ. We need to go through the files. If he's repeating his first kills, then we know where the next girl will be."" TJ lagged behind, but soon the two were both in the car. They made their way to the station, the radio giving another bulletin. ""More and more melted water is causing floods near"" Static chirped to interrupt the announcers voice, then it returned. ""Large chunks of ice have drifted towards areas such as"" Just then, the cb radio cracked to life. ""Detective Ellner, please respond to a code J Zero One"" Without hesitation, Rick picked up the radio receiver. ""This is Ellner, We're on it. Location?"" Instantly, the two thought another Angel Maker scene, even though it was too soon. Their thoughts changed when they made it to the outskirts of town.

Near the welcome sign of Allavandrel, crumpled in the fetal position was a body. The sight of the corpse was not accompanied by an angelic figure of snow. The individual was fully clothed, save for the large gashes, and cuts around the back and chest area. No major wounds, replaced organs or Christmas decor. The victim was male, which had never been part of Angel Maker's selected victims. Several questions filled the minds of the detectives as they knelt down to examine the scene. Blood was frozen to the fabric and snow, and deep cuts. The wounds were not deep enough to cause death, however. Once photos were taken and the body was able to be moved, a gasp escaped the coroner. Rick and TJ looked, and both men raised an eyebrow. Then TJ muttered softly. ""What in the hell?"" Stetched across the dead man's face was a ghastly smile. The corners of his mouth were cracked, showing every tooth that was stained with a brown sludge. The eyes were wide open but lacked any color except for the enlarged pupils. It was grotesque, and the face looked more like a Halloween mask than a flesh and blood face. The body was placed in a bag and hauled off to the station. 

Rick went home around two in the morning, scratching his head at what the new crime was. Could Angel Maker have chosen to change his tactics? Could the monster have decided to grab an extra kill? The last question he asked himself really sent his stomach to his feet. Was there another serial killer loose in town? Rick's mind swirled with questions and theories, but nothing gave answers or any clarity. The only solution he found was at the bottom of a liquor bottle. Two days later, another smiling corpse was found. It resembled the same pattern as the first, but only this time, it was an elderly woman. Tj was on a different call, so Rick was alone during his examination. The look of the smiling, decrepit face left him feeling uneasy. The more he focused on it, the more melancholy it became. Then, out of nowhere, a sound flooded his hears. A low murmur of a laugh. Dry and emotionless, like that of morbid sarcasm. It tickled his ear, and he looked in all directions but did not find the owner of the ominous laugh. He thought his mind was playing tricks on him. But as he left the scene, the wind blew, and the hollow chuckle accompanied it. 

V.

It was two weeks before Christmas, and in that time, three more girls were discovered along with four more smiling bodies. To add to the unease and frustration, sting operations had been placed in hopes of catching Angel Maker. The latest bodies were all found near the same areas as the first appearanceof Allavandrel'sserial killer. But even though multiple squad cars sat for reconicenese, there were no sightings. It was only after the authorities left the scene that the bodies were discovered. As if Angel Maker was watching and knew the police were waiting. Things were getting strange, and it left more questions than answers. Even stranger was that Rick noticed that his partner was always either the one to discover them or the first on scene. Then there were the smiling faces of the dead found in the outskirts of town that slowly reached the main hub of Allavandrel. Rick thought he was losing his mind because every body he examined, that dry, crackling laugh flowed with the wind. And he swore he saw a strung out junkie in the background. A tall, lanky, framed man who wore hardly any clothing. Sick boils and other pustules covering the body. He noticed a horrific smile on the face, but that was all he saw due to the hiding behind long strands of dark hair. Rick made a point to question the junkie but by the time he approached, the man had already disappeared. Rick talked with TJ about it, but this brought no closure. Then a series of cataclysmic events took place, beginning withTJ abruptly had a meeting and left his keys in Rick's car.

Rick noticed the keys later on in the night after his shift. He grabbed the set and decided to drop them off at TJ's house. That's when something caught his eye. A small gold pendant with a tiny diamond at the center. To his knowledge, TJ had never been married and as far as Rick knew, the man was not in a relationship. Granted, Rick did not interact with his partner outside of work, but thought he had enough knowledge of the man's out of work life. That night he stopped at his partners residence and left the keys in the mailbox, spying the multiple ornaments and angels decorating the lawn. At the time, he thought nothing of it and drove home. As he lay in bed, the cases rolled through the confines of his brain, and then something clicked. The pendant, he thought he had seen it before. The image refused to leave his mind to the point that sleep would not come. So Rick headed to the station super early to go through all of the dossiers on Angel Maker. The papers and pictures of those poor desecrated women littered his desk. He drank heavily from the bottle stashed in a drawer. His mind swirled, and his anger flowed like water. He slammed his fist down on the desk. Slowly, a picture slid from the pile and landed on the floor. He picked it up and scanned it. Elizabeth Colter, the first girl to be found back before the serial killer, got his name. Gutted like a deer and wrapped with garland at the front steps leading to the fountain of Boyce Park. The memories burned bright in Rick's mind, and that's when it hit him. He looked harder at the photos, and there it was. The small gold heart with the tiny diamond. He choked on the bourbon as he peered at the sight. ""Son of a bitch."" Questions and scenarios were forming and without thinking, Rick left the office and headed back to TJ's. He wasn't sure what he was gonna do but obviously his partner had tampered with evidence. Rick wouldn't stand for this. He had another thought, but prayed it wasn't true.

He pulled in the driveway, noticing that TJ's car was still gone and all the lights were off. ""Where the hell is he at four in the morning?"" Rick spoke outloud to himself as he exited his car. He walked up the steps, holster unbuttoned. His hand searched the mailbox, the keys were still inside. Without a thought, Rick unlocked the door and stepped inside.

At first, the living room seemed ordinary, but then the images of angels and Christmas decorations covered the entirety when Rick lit up his flashlight. With the murders going on, the decorations seemed morbid to him. He crept through other rooms, searching for something he was not entirely sure of what yet. Never being in this house, the landscape was unknown to the detective. Then he stopped when he heard a thud. It came from below, and then it returned quickly, followed by a muffled wine. The search of the sound brought Rick to a door near the kitchen. It had a lock on it, and as luck would have it, the key was accompanied on the keychain. Rick slowly descended to a damp and musty smelling basement. Light flickered within the brick walls, and the sounds grew louder. This is when recollection and rage flooded him. Lining the walls were clippings of the Angel Maker case. On the other side was an altar of sorts. Angels covered in red and black paint, near unlit candles were articles of jewelry. Next to the jewelry were remnants of severed fingers, some rotting and withered. His search stopped when another whimper filled the room. He jerked to the left and dropped his flashlight. In front of him was a nude woman, tied up to a blood-stained mattress. A blind fold covered her eyes and a rag over her mouth. Blood crusted her nostrils. She was squirming and crying. ""Jesus christ."" Rick whispered. He quickly ran to the girl and removed the rags. She coughed and screamed in terror. It took some time to calm her down, she spoke with hysteria, leaving nothing comprehensive. And all of the sudden foootsteps could be heard upstairs. Then the sound of TJ's voiced echoed. ""Rick? Where are you buddy?""

VI.

The flashing of blue and red lights illuminated Rick's face as he watched the girl be taken into the ambulance. The chatter of radio static and voices were all but muffled to him. The events of the last two hours were all a blur. The only thing that remained was him watching the life leave TJ's eyes as Rick strangled him to death. The bastard deserved to die in his opinion, and seeing that this case was his, it seemed only fitting that he be the one to do it. But he caught hell for this. Seeing that it was technically in self-defense and Rick had killed a serial killer, there was a gray area surrounding the case of him killing TJ. In the end, Rick was both suspended for a week and also given a pat on the back for taking out Angel Maker. He was instructed to seek mandatory therapy as well. Within that basement, police found trinkets from every victim such as pieces of their hair, severed appendages and pictures of them before and after their gruesome ends. The case had finally been solved, making Detective Rick Ellner a hero and a murderer. Poetic justice, in a sense. For the week of his suspension, Rick sat around the house, drinking and feeling a slight bit of relief. It was short-lived as he flipped through the channels of his TV. He turned it on to the news station, still discussing the melting of the polar ice caps. ""The nation continues to find large chunks of ice floating in different regions, some are found to encase"" He flipped to the next channel, and his blood ran cold. ""This is in, discovered in the backyard of the infamous serial killer, Angel Maker, formerly Detective Trevor Jameson, was the body of a young boy."" Rick listened intently and began to grind his teeth at the details. Torn clothing, deep cuts, splashed blood, dilated pupils, and the glued smile carved in the boys face. He took in the reported speculations of it being Angel Maker's final kill or the workings of a second serial killer in Allavandrel. At the time, his station had chalked up the smile murders to be part of TJ's sick game. Rick had also believed it for a moment. But there was no way. If the body had been there, it would've been discovered the day Rick strangled TJ. Unless someone else had slain the boy.

Although he couldn't interfere or help in the case, Rick knew he had to go. So he got in his car after taking a few shots of bourbon. The streets were covered in sleet with a few patches of black ice. The temperature had dropped down to the low twenties. The road swayed back and forth from the intoxication. Rick swerved, nearly hitting a parked car on the side street near TJ's neighborhood. Finally, he pulled up to the house that was swarming with police cars. The yellow tape around the yard bounced from the chill wind. The snow crunched under Rick's feet as he trudged towards the backyard. Images of the girl and TJ's dying face assaulted his thoughts. He shook off the mental displays and continued on. He crept up near the scene. It was just as described on the news report. But to see it in person was worse. It made his stomach churn to see the teenager left discarded in such a grizzly display. And that smile, that horrible smile, sent a twinge of morbidity that raised the hairs on Rick's neck. He tried to get some extra details but was reminded of his lack of involvement in the case. He huffed and turned to head back towards his car he had left running. He looked towards the trees bordering the house and paused. The deep white eyes pierced through him, and his breath shivered. It was the junkie, the same one he had been seeing periodically at the smiling crimes. ""Bastard."" Rick murmured to himself. He wasn't letting the guy get away this time. So he started walking towards the man. As he did so, the figure turned and walked in a stiff, jerking motion. The wind picked up, and the sound of laughter accompanied it. ""You think the death of a child is funny, you son of a bitch?"" The anger flowed through the Detective and he felt steam rise from his body. Something told him this guy was guilty. Due to his suspension, his gun and badge were taken away so he was unarmed. But at this point he didn't care, and he thought to himself. ""Would the world really miss another murderer?"" Rick had used his hands to remove Angel Maker so he could always repeat this if the man he was tailing was guilty.
Rick pushed beyond the snow-covered branches, barely able to see the man who was still laughing beyond. He started to jog, making sure he didn't lose the prick this time.

After a few minutes, the sounds of chatter from the crime scene faded, and all that resonated in the woods were the wind, birds, and the ominous chuckles from Rick's target. Before long, he came to a clearing. A small cubby hole in the woods that housed a few conifers and sleet covered stones. That is where the detective spied his target. The man was sitting on a rock and showing his full self. Rick spied a lanky frame, adorned with splotches of frost bite that oozed brown pus. Sections of the blues white skin had crystallized abrasions. The man wore no shoes or really any clothes. Only the petrified and stinking straps of some animal fur. The man sat motionless, a chuckle followed by a grumble. The sickly looking man was using his elongated nails to dig at an open sore. The wet sloshing of the act made Rick wince. He spat with frustration. ""Don't move, you sick bastard! Laughing at the dead? You're coming with me."" When the words faded, the figure lifted its head in a robotic motion, peering at Rick with completely white eyes, void of any emotion. Then the body rose to its feet, displaying an ungodly height. Rick had to tilt his head upwards to view this. A grimacing smile stretched from ear to ear, displaying jagged teeth of ivory. The clouds above shifted to release sunlight that created an opal shimmer on the things flesh. Rick swallowed a lump in his throat, regretting not bringing something to defend himself. Even though riddled with fear, the man stood his ground. He balled his fist, anticipating a fight with this creature. But before he could react, the thing was on him. The laughter rang in his ears as he felt the sharp nails digging into his body. The burning mixed with the unctrollable tickle to his nerves. In a strange turn of events, Rick began to laugh from the sensation. The woods were filled with the cacophony of laughter and the sound of a struggle.

On the morning of Christmas, a woman sat in her living room while two children praised all of the presents Santa had brought them. She had left the TV on for background noise when a breaking story tuned in to the latest details on the murders within the town of Allavandrel, Maine. The male news reporter read the following prompt. ""Early this morning, the body of Rick Ellner was discovered in Harbinger Woods behind Alistor Avenue. Particularly near the residence of the late Trevor Jameson, better known as the Angel Maker. Ellner was the leader investigator and partner of the recently discovered identy of the serial killer. Ellner had solved and eliminated Jameson after discovering evidence of his crimes along with a woman chained in his basement. No doubt being prepared to be the next victim. Detective Ellner was discovered with lacerations all over his torso and left in the snow. Due to the conditions of his murder, police have labeled him the latest victim of the ever growing case of Smiling Murders. More details as the story unfolds. Be careful out there, folks. Things like this are the last thing we need during this usual happy holiday. Thoughts and prayers to the family of the detective.""
The woman rolled a wedding ring attached to her necklace, looking at her children, and began to cry. The children walked over to her, oblivious to the news or their mother's tears. ""Mommy, do you think daddy will come to visit us for Christmas? Or is he still on the naughty list?""

I'm not super into being a hard-core patron of those places (a little too in your face IMO) but has anyone had success freestyling at a place like that?

The chilling arctic wind nipped at the exposed cheeks of a boy, accompanied by his uncle, father, and dog. The chilling breeze whistled past the individuals as the deep snow crunched beneath their feet. Furs and leathers were doubled in layers, thick straps utilized to create a tight fit to block out the cold. ""How much further?"" The young boy asked, chattering his teeth between each word. There was no answer for some time before his uncle stopped and knelt down to face him. ""We are almost on its trail. We have to be careful and silent. If it hears us approaching, we could be next."" The boy nodded and stifled the fear welling up inside of him. Footsteps continued, and the dog pounced through the snow, occasionally pausing to sniff the air. A strong vortex picked up, and the animal let out a deep growl. It gnashed its teeth towards the flurry of snow that was getting heavier. The group stopped, watching the dogs actions. Hand signals were used. Unfortunately, the boy had no idea what they meant. Soon, a sound crept into their ears. It started off soft, barely a murmur until it reached a crescendo that rivaled the wind. It was laughter. The eerie tone of it sent a chill to run down the boy's spine.

The chime was hollow and emotionless. It returned in waves of threes. The hair on the dogs back stood up, and it spun towards the group. Foaming saliva rolled from the gleaming teeth, turning to ice from the harsh weather. It barked and then lunged towards the boy. In a flash of quick movements, blood spattered on the fresh snow, followed by the final yelp of the rabid creature. The boy's father stood motionless, still clutching the spear he had used to stop the dog. ""It's here."" The man spoke without removing his gaze from the animal. The spear was removed, and they continued forward. Waves of laughter returned but more profound this time. The boy was instructed to cover his ears. He did so and followed the adults until they came upon footprints. Large prints of barefeet trudged through frozen layers of dark blood. Drag marks followed each foot as if something was being pulled at each side of the wanderer. Fear bubbled up through the boy, and he shivered. The act was not from the cold but the agonizing terror of the thing they pursued.

Menacing chuckles followed with the wind, and the boy pressed harder against his frigid ears. The sound was muffled but still apparent. He looked down towards his feet, occasionally spying more of those massive bloodied footprints. Before long, he ran into the still frame of his father. No words were spoken or hand gestures utilized. Instead, the boys father grunted and nodded his head. The pulsing heart inside the boy's body skipped a beat when his eyes fell upon what had caused the ceasing of motion. Towards a frost covered boulder, stood a man. Not an ordinary man by any means. This man was deathly thin with pale skin that had an opalescent sheen. Ice crystals covered countless areas of the abrasive flesh along with purple and black splotches of frostbite. Aside from the bits of tattered and rotting furs, the body was exposed to the elements. Long strands of frozen hair dangled in front of a gaunt face. Barely visible through the locks of obsidian were a set of unblinking eyes. Wide and without pupils, the things scanned the white landscape. A crooked smile stretched across cracked, blue lips. A long stream of brown liquid stained the corners and dripped over the jawline. 

The things head looked left, then right before kneeling down. That horrible laugh spewed from the sinister mouth. The thing began to fumble with something at its feet. The three stood there in awe, trying to ascertain what it was doing. Realization took over in the form of the boy gasping. Tears dropped and froze to his skin as he cried at the sight of his dead mother and sister. Their corpses tangled together in a small pool of blood. Their furs had large rips, exposing torn flesh. The most horrific part was there still open eyes, accompanied by the same smile as the thing that took them. The mystery of their fates had been discovered in the worst possible way. Chomping and slurping comensed as the wretched thing began to eat the remnants of the two women. The boy clinched his teeth and tried to hold back the wailing but to no avail. He let out a cry that caught the attention of the emaciated creature. The boy's uncle quickly cupped his mouth. ""Hush. You need to be quiet."" But it was too late. The creature had stopped its feast and jerked its head forward. Blood oozed from the grinning mouth, and it stood up.

There was no time to plan, only attack. The boys father let out a war cry and charged towards the thing, spear gripped in both hands. The second adult followed suit after instructing the boy to remain at his spot. The men charged towards the scrawny and menacing ice demin. The charging hastened until all three crashed with a thud. The spear missed its target, the father was knocked back, and the uncle was lifted from the ground with a bony hand. The laughing echoed in the dry air. The creature's free hand rose and spread a set of five abnormally long fingers with deep black nails at the end. The next few moments are blurry due to the child covering his face. But in the end, his uncle was dead and bloody, a large smile etched on his lifeless face. The boys father fought with all his might but also lost. The scuffle and weight of the three bodies caused a large crack to form below their feet. None aware of the fact they they stood on a thick slab of ice. The cracking grew louder until a hole gave way, sending the boys father and the monster jolting towards the icy depths. The boy sat in fright as he watched his father sink. His heart thumped in his chest at the loss. However, the worst sight was that of the pale face, slowly sinking into the abyss. Those white eyes pierced through the frozen locks of hair. Its laugh seeped through the display of sharp teeth that echoed until it finally broke the waters edge, leaving the boy all alone in the desolate cold.

II.

The glowing numbers of the alarm clock shifted from 6:59 to 7:00, and the voice of Burl Ives rang through its speaker, telling the world to have a Holly Jolly Christmas. ""God damnit! Shut up!"" Screamed the already annoyed man who quickly sat up his bed. He jammed his thumb into the off button and got to his feet. ""God, I hate this shit."" He spoke to himself while putting on his pants and walking to his dresser. A bottle of whiskey was snatched up, and the lid was removed. The man grabbed the glass next to it and poured the brown liquid, then swallowed the whole thing in one gulp. The sting of the alcohol caused a wince, then warmth took over as it slowly made its way down to the man's stomach. He put on a shirt and then stepped out of the bedroom. A loud ringing echoed in the hallway, which sent the man speed walking towards it. He lifted the recieve and spoke in a harsh voice. ""Yea?"" Another voice came from the other end. ""Rick. He's back."" The man holding the phone raised an eyebrow. ""Who's back?"" There was not a moment of pause with the response. ""Angel maker."" Anger welled up in the man, and he snorted. ""Give me the address, and I'll be there as soon as I can."" He wrote down the info on a sticky note and hastily got ready.

With the turning of a key, the car purred to life. The winter air left a trail of steam to rise from the tail pipe. The vehicle sped off, and the anxious man, better known as Detective Rick Ellner, was headed towards what was most likely another twisted gift from a demented giver. Rick drove through the frost covered streets of the town he had grown up in his whole life. Snow shifting lazily with the slight breeze in the air. Christmas lights were on display but not lit, wreaths and trees set up, images of Santa, and periodically he saw children building snowmen. All of the things he loathed this time of year. When most people think of Christmas, they associate the holiday with joy, family, and happiness. For Rick, it only meant sorrow, regret, anger, and solitude. This would mark the third year of a dreadful season. His thoughts harkened back to his wife and children. Their faces, smiling and displaying those soft, happy eyes. Then, the mood shifted into tears, screaming and crying. The reel of images morphed from scene to scene until it landed on the monstrous displays of desecrated bodies. All sprawled out in the snow, covered in blood and lascerations. Angel Maker, the name coined for a heartless lunatic who had sent a plague of fear to infect the town of Allavandrel. Bodies tore open, stuffed with Yule tide trinkets of all sorts. Blood coated their bodies and left to freeze in the cold. These corpses all had been manipulated in the snow to create wings beneath them. Hence, the name published in tabloids and news bulletins.

This had been Rick's obsession ever since he was called to the first case. The lifeless body of a fifteen year old girl left him feeling dead inside. This spanned a total of nine other victims, all left in the same manner. No clues found, no murder weapon. There was nothing to link a culprit to these heinous acts of violence. The work spilled into his home life, which in turn led him to becoming an alcoholic. The liquor morphed Rick into an abusive, neglectful terror within the walls of his home. Instead of finding the serial killer, he took his frustration out on his family. After the fifth broken bone, his wife divorced him and took the kids without warning. A week before Christmas. Since then, the lonesome detective had zero contact with his children and didn't even know where they went. Instead of sobering up and trying to make amends, Rick spiraled deeper into his bottle and spent every waking moment plotting his suicide. However, in reality, he was a coward and could never bring himself to pull the trigger. So instead, he wasted away on boose and obsessing over the elusive creator of bloodied snow angels. The case went cold after the ninth week. Two things were maintained with this sadistic bastard, his MO, and his pattern. After the first snow, a body would be found in a public place, and each week, another would arrive until the body count reached that magic number , and Angel Maker would dissappear. The monster had returned with the cold once again, and Rick was determined to get his guy this time. 

III.

Rick pulled up to the edge of Boyce Park. A crowd had already formed near the caution tape. The radio in his car was blaring a news report. ""Despite the freezing temperatures, the polar ice caps continue to melt, sending waves of water and huge chunks of ice..."" Rick turned the car off and stepped out.

He pushed his way past people, completely ignoring the relentless news reporter who had received a broken jaw from the last time he attempted to interview Rick last year. Once past the tape and local police officers, Rick's partner shuffled towards him. ""Bout damn time you got here! The bastard changed things up with this one."" The stocky frame of Detective Trevor Jameson, or TJ for short, whisked Rick hurriedly towards the crime scene. In a distasteful display of savagery lay the remains of a young woman. She was posed flat on the snow, the form of an angel beneath her, coated in blood. No clothing covered the body, showing the gaping slash in the woman's abdomen that expelled frozen entrails wrapped up in the shape of a bow. Christmas lights were wrapped around her neck, which had also been slashed open. The usually leavings of Rick's bane of existence. But this time, something was different.

""Female, early twenties, maybe younger. As usual, her throat and stomach were slashed. As we expected, Angel maker left his signature symbol and decorated the body. But this time it's different, take a look."" Rick followed the hand his partner pointed with to view the face. The poor woman's eyes were gone and replaced with pieces of a shattered mirror. Wedged in viciously. ""Sick son of a bitch."" Rick muttered under his breath. TJ gave further details then ended with the question of what the mirrored eyes meant. No real answer was given. Instead, Rick scanned the scene, noticing that only one set of foot prints were present. A set of two right at the womans feet, as if the killer stood there to admire his work. Another repititious detail from prior murders. In the past, molds had been made to get a print for whatever shoes were worn but nothing ever came through. Upon further inspection, it was noted that a section of hair was removed along with her pinky finger. This was not new because Angel Maker always took a piece of his victims, except this time he took two articles. A year had already passed since the last string of murders and this one occurred on the exact same day as previous years but felt different in ways. Rick told himself that this would be the end of the sick bastard. Eventually, the two men left the scene to escape the cold and get coffee to further discuss the newest addition to the list of slain women. 

The victim followed the exact same circumstances as the others. Esteemed and loved individual who had been kidnapped out of the blue from another state to be found sometime later, disgraced and mutiliated by the hands of Allavandrel's infamous serial killer. Every victim hailed from neighboring states and would later be dumped in Maine. The first one of the year was always left in a public place for all to see. The others left in more obscure regions of town. But they all maintained their locations in this specific town. That detail led the authorities to believe Angel Maker was a native of Allavandrel. But since the beginning of the crimes, no suspects or evidence whatsoever had been found. Rick pondered on this as he stirred the spoon in his coffee. TJ continued discussing the case, all details going in one ear and out the other for Rick. That was until his partner pointed out that this new girl was found only ten yards from the very first victim. Rick had been so focused on the body that he hadn't realized the location. That night he stayed up late with a bottle of Jack and the case files from Angel Maker's first appearance. The tumblers were rolling in Rick's head and his focus was at full force towards finding the deranged psychopath. 

IV. 

A week had passed since the discovery of the woman found in Boyce Park, and Rick had yet to find any new details. His stress was rising, especially after another victim was found, courtesy of his enemy. The second bloody snow angel was found near Olive Creek, which Rick realized was the same as the second victim from the first year of Angel Maker. The only difference was that this new woman was on the opposite edge of the water. This unfortunate soul also had an organ replaced. Her heart was ripped out, and in its place was a glass tree ornament in the shape of a cartoon heart. The shiny object reflected the angered face of Rick. ""God damnit. How did no one see anything?!"" Tj placed a hand on his shoulder. ""I don't know, Rick. We're just lucky I was out on a stroll and found her. We're gonna get him this time."" The cold breeze picked up and assaulted Rick's face. He shook it off and got back to his feet. ""Let's go, TJ. We need to go through the files. If he's repeating his first kills, then we know where the next girl will be."" TJ lagged behind, but soon the two were both in the car. They made their way to the station, the radio giving another bulletin. ""More and more melted water is causing floods near"" Static chirped to interrupt the announcers voice, then it returned. ""Large chunks of ice have drifted towards areas such as"" Just then, the cb radio cracked to life. ""Detective Ellner, please respond to a code J Zero One"" Without hesitation, Rick picked up the radio receiver. ""This is Ellner, We're on it. Location?"" Instantly, the two thought another Angel Maker scene, even though it was too soon. Their thoughts changed when they made it to the outskirts of town.

Near the welcome sign of Allavandrel, crumpled in the fetal position was a body. The sight of the corpse was not accompanied by an angelic figure of snow. The individual was fully clothed, save for the large gashes, and cuts around the back and chest area. No major wounds, replaced organs or Christmas decor. The victim was male, which had never been part of Angel Maker's selected victims. Several questions filled the minds of the detectives as they knelt down to examine the scene. Blood was frozen to the fabric and snow, and deep cuts. The wounds were not deep enough to cause death, however. Once photos were taken and the body was able to be moved, a gasp escaped the coroner. Rick and TJ looked, and both men raised an eyebrow. Then TJ muttered softly. ""What in the hell?"" Stetched across the dead man's face was a ghastly smile. The corners of his mouth were cracked, showing every tooth that was stained with a brown sludge. The eyes were wide open but lacked any color except for the enlarged pupils. It was grotesque, and the face looked more like a Halloween mask than a flesh and blood face. The body was placed in a bag and hauled off to the station. 

Rick went home around two in the morning, scratching his head at what the new crime was. Could Angel Maker have chosen to change his tactics? Could the monster have decided to grab an extra kill? The last question he asked himself really sent his stomach to his feet. Was there another serial killer loose in town? Rick's mind swirled with questions and theories, but nothing gave answers or any clarity. The only solution he found was at the bottom of a liquor bottle. Two days later, another smiling corpse was found. It resembled the same pattern as the first, but only this time, it was an elderly woman. Tj was on a different call, so Rick was alone during his examination. The look of the smiling, decrepit face left him feeling uneasy. The more he focused on it, the more melancholy it became. Then, out of nowhere, a sound flooded his hears. A low murmur of a laugh. Dry and emotionless, like that of morbid sarcasm. It tickled his ear, and he looked in all directions but did not find the owner of the ominous laugh. He thought his mind was playing tricks on him. But as he left the scene, the wind blew, and the hollow chuckle accompanied it. 

V.

It was two weeks before Christmas, and in that time, three more girls were discovered along with four more smiling bodies. To add to the unease and frustration, sting operations had been placed in hopes of catching Angel Maker. The latest bodies were all found near the same areas as the first appearanceof Allavandrel'sserial killer. But even though multiple squad cars sat for reconicenese, there were no sightings. It was only after the authorities left the scene that the bodies were discovered. As if Angel Maker was watching and knew the police were waiting. Things were getting strange, and it left more questions than answers. Even stranger was that Rick noticed that his partner was always either the one to discover them or the first on scene. Then there were the smiling faces of the dead found in the outskirts of town that slowly reached the main hub of Allavandrel. Rick thought he was losing his mind because every body he examined, that dry, crackling laugh flowed with the wind. And he swore he saw a strung out junkie in the background. A tall, lanky, framed man who wore hardly any clothing. Sick boils and other pustules covering the body. He noticed a horrific smile on the face, but that was all he saw due to the hiding behind long strands of dark hair. Rick made a point to question the junkie but by the time he approached, the man had already disappeared. Rick talked with TJ about it, but this brought no closure. Then a series of cataclysmic events took place, beginning withTJ abruptly had a meeting and left his keys in Rick's car.

Rick noticed the keys later on in the night after his shift. He grabbed the set and decided to drop them off at TJ's house. That's when something caught his eye. A small gold pendant with a tiny diamond at the center. To his knowledge, TJ had never been married and as far as Rick knew, the man was not in a relationship. Granted, Rick did not interact with his partner outside of work, but thought he had enough knowledge of the man's out of work life. That night he stopped at his partners residence and left the keys in the mailbox, spying the multiple ornaments and angels decorating the lawn. At the time, he thought nothing of it and drove home. As he lay in bed, the cases rolled through the confines of his brain, and then something clicked. The pendant, he thought he had seen it before. The image refused to leave his mind to the point that sleep would not come. So Rick headed to the station super early to go through all of the dossiers on Angel Maker. The papers and pictures of those poor desecrated women littered his desk. He drank heavily from the bottle stashed in a drawer. His mind swirled, and his anger flowed like water. He slammed his fist down on the desk. Slowly, a picture slid from the pile and landed on the floor. He picked it up and scanned it. Elizabeth Colter, the first girl to be found back before the serial killer, got his name. Gutted like a deer and wrapped with garland at the front steps leading to the fountain of Boyce Park. The memories burned bright in Rick's mind, and that's when it hit him. He looked harder at the photos, and there it was. The small gold heart with the tiny diamond. He choked on the bourbon as he peered at the sight. ""Son of a bitch."" Questions and scenarios were forming and without thinking, Rick left the office and headed back to TJ's. He wasn't sure what he was gonna do but obviously his partner had tampered with evidence. Rick wouldn't stand for this. He had another thought, but prayed it wasn't true.

He pulled in the driveway, noticing that TJ's car was still gone and all the lights were off. ""Where the hell is he at four in the morning?"" Rick spoke outloud to himself as he exited his car. He walked up the steps, holster unbuttoned. His hand searched the mailbox, the keys were still inside. Without a thought, Rick unlocked the door and stepped inside.

At first, the living room seemed ordinary, but then the images of angels and Christmas decorations covered the entirety when Rick lit up his flashlight. With the murders going on, the decorations seemed morbid to him. He crept through other rooms, searching for something he was not entirely sure of what yet. Never being in this house, the landscape was unknown to the detective. Then he stopped when he heard a thud. It came from below, and then it returned quickly, followed by a muffled wine. The search of the sound brought Rick to a door near the kitchen. It had a lock on it, and as luck would have it, the key was accompanied on the keychain. Rick slowly descended to a damp and musty smelling basement. Light flickered within the brick walls, and the sounds grew louder. This is when recollection and rage flooded him. Lining the walls were clippings of the Angel Maker case. On the other side was an altar of sorts. Angels covered in red and black paint, near unlit candles were articles of jewelry. Next to the jewelry were remnants of severed fingers, some rotting and withered. His search stopped when another whimper filled the room. He jerked to the left and dropped his flashlight. In front of him was a nude woman, tied up to a blood-stained mattress. A blind fold covered her eyes and a rag over her mouth. Blood crusted her nostrils. She was squirming and crying. ""Jesus christ."" Rick whispered. He quickly ran to the girl and removed the rags. She coughed and screamed in terror. It took some time to calm her down, she spoke with hysteria, leaving nothing comprehensive. And all of the sudden foootsteps could be heard upstairs. Then the sound of TJ's voiced echoed. ""Rick? Where are you buddy?""

VI.

The flashing of blue and red lights illuminated Rick's face as he watched the girl be taken into the ambulance. The chatter of radio static and voices were all but muffled to him. The events of the last two hours were all a blur. The only thing that remained was him watching the life leave TJ's eyes as Rick strangled him to death. The bastard deserved to die in his opinion, and seeing that this case was his, it seemed only fitting that he be the one to do it. But he caught hell for this. Seeing that it was technically in self-defense and Rick had killed a serial killer, there was a gray area surrounding the case of him killing TJ. In the end, Rick was both suspended for a week and also given a pat on the back for taking out Angel Maker. He was instructed to seek mandatory therapy as well. Within that basement, police found trinkets from every victim such as pieces of their hair, severed appendages and pictures of them before and after their gruesome ends. The case had finally been solved, making Detective Rick Ellner a hero and a murderer. Poetic justice, in a sense. For the week of his suspension, Rick sat around the house, drinking and feeling a slight bit of relief. It was short-lived as he flipped through the channels of his TV. He turned it on to the news station, still discussing the melting of the polar ice caps. ""The nation continues to find large chunks of ice floating in different regions, some are found to encase"" He flipped to the next channel, and his blood ran cold. ""This is in, discovered in the backyard of the infamous serial killer, Angel Maker, formerly Detective Trevor Jameson, was the body of a young boy."" Rick listened intently and began to grind his teeth at the details. Torn clothing, deep cuts, splashed blood, dilated pupils, and the glued smile carved in the boys face. He took in the reported speculations of it being Angel Maker's final kill or the workings of a second serial killer in Allavandrel. At the time, his station had chalked up the smile murders to be part of TJ's sick game. Rick had also believed it for a moment. But there was no way. If the body had been there, it would've been discovered the day Rick strangled TJ. Unless someone else had slain the boy.

Although he couldn't interfere or help in the case, Rick knew he had to go. So he got in his car after taking a few shots of bourbon. The streets were covered in sleet with a few patches of black ice. The temperature had dropped down to the low twenties. The road swayed back and forth from the intoxication. Rick swerved, nearly hitting a parked car on the side street near TJ's neighborhood. Finally, he pulled up to the house that was swarming with police cars. The yellow tape around the yard bounced from the chill wind. The snow crunched under Rick's feet as he trudged towards the backyard. Images of the girl and TJ's dying face assaulted his thoughts. He shook off the mental displays and continued on. He crept up near the scene. It was just as described on the news report. But to see it in person was worse. It made his stomach churn to see the teenager left discarded in such a grizzly display. And that smile, that horrible smile, sent a twinge of morbidity that raised the hairs on Rick's neck. He tried to get some extra details but was reminded of his lack of involvement in the case. He huffed and turned to head back towards his car he had left running. He looked towards the trees bordering the house and paused. The deep white eyes pierced through him, and his breath shivered. It was the junkie, the same one he had been seeing periodically at the smiling crimes. ""Bastard."" Rick murmured to himself. He wasn't letting the guy get away this time. So he started walking towards the man. As he did so, the figure turned and walked in a stiff, jerking motion. The wind picked up, and the sound of laughter accompanied it. ""You think the death of a child is funny, you son of a bitch?"" The anger flowed through the Detective and he felt steam rise from his body. Something told him this guy was guilty. Due to his suspension, his gun and badge were taken away so he was unarmed. But at this point he didn't care, and he thought to himself. ""Would the world really miss another murderer?"" Rick had used his hands to remove Angel Maker so he could always repeat this if the man he was tailing was guilty.
Rick pushed beyond the snow-covered branches, barely able to see the man who was still laughing beyond. He started to jog, making sure he didn't lose the prick this time.

After a few minutes, the sounds of chatter from the crime scene faded, and all that resonated in the woods were the wind, birds, and the ominous chuckles from Rick's target. Before long, he came to a clearing. A small cubby hole in the woods that housed a few conifers and sleet covered stones. That is where the detective spied his target. The man was sitting on a rock and showing his full self. Rick spied a lanky frame, adorned with splotches of frost bite that oozed brown pus. Sections of the blues white skin had crystallized abrasions. The man wore no shoes or really any clothes. Only the petrified and stinking straps of some animal fur. The man sat motionless, a chuckle followed by a grumble. The sickly looking man was using his elongated nails to dig at an open sore. The wet sloshing of the act made Rick wince. He spat with frustration. ""Don't move, you sick bastard! Laughing at the dead? You're coming with me."" When the words faded, the figure lifted its head in a robotic motion, peering at Rick with completely white eyes, void of any emotion. Then the body rose to its feet, displaying an ungodly height. Rick had to tilt his head upwards to view this. A grimacing smile stretched from ear to ear, displaying jagged teeth of ivory. The clouds above shifted to release sunlight that created an opal shimmer on the things flesh. Rick swallowed a lump in his throat, regretting not bringing something to defend himself. Even though riddled with fear, the man stood his ground. He balled his fist, anticipating a fight with this creature. But before he could react, the thing was on him. The laughter rang in his ears as he felt the sharp nails digging into his body. The burning mixed with the unctrollable tickle to his nerves. In a strange turn of events, Rick began to laugh from the sensation. The woods were filled with the cacophony of laughter and the sound of a struggle.

On the morning of Christmas, a woman sat in her living room while two children praised all of the presents Santa had brought them. She had left the TV on for background noise when a breaking story tuned in to the latest details on the murders within the town of Allavandrel, Maine. The male news reporter read the following prompt. ""Early this morning, the body of Rick Ellner was discovered in Harbinger Woods behind Alistor Avenue. Particularly near the residence of the late Trevor Jameson, better known as the Angel Maker. Ellner was the leader investigator and partner of the recently discovered identy of the serial killer. Ellner had solved and eliminated Jameson after discovering evidence of his crimes along with a woman chained in his basement. No doubt being prepared to be the next victim. Detective Ellner was discovered with lacerations all over his torso and left in the snow. Due to the conditions of his murder, police have labeled him the latest victim of the ever growing case of Smiling Murders. More details as the story unfolds. Be careful out there, folks. Things like this are the last thing we need during this usual happy holiday. Thoughts and prayers to the family of the detective.""
The woman rolled a wedding ring attached to her necklace, looking at her children, and began to cry. The children walked over to her, oblivious to the news or their mother's tears. ""Mommy, do you think daddy will come to visit us for Christmas? Or is he still on the naughty list?""

 My husband (43m) and I (40f) have been married for almost 10 years. We‚Äôve had a lot of ups and downs with jobs, money, kids, undiagnosed mental health conditions etc. I acknowledge that I did things I shouldn‚Äôt have done in the past and we are in counseling and trying to move on. 

Both my therapist and our marriage counselor say that we‚Äôve been in survival mode for the majority of our marriage, so we haven‚Äôt been prioritizing the marriage as much as we should have been, hence the disconnection. My husband isn‚Äôt the most emotionally available person and it‚Äôs caused issues, but we share kids and a life so we‚Äôre trying to make it work, and have been for several years. 

In the fall of this year we put our house on the market which was an extra layer of stress and admittedly I think we both took the stress out on each other. We have never had a perfect marriage, but there was no lapse in affection, I love you‚Äôs or sex, we were just more on edge than usual and the disconnection between us worsened. 

 A couple weeks before Thanksgiving he sits me down and says he‚Äôs not sure he‚Äôs in love with me anymore. It was sudden and of course my first thought is there‚Äôs someone else.  I saw Ashley Madison emails coming in on his computer and he denies that even though the preponderance of evidence suggests he did in fact make a profile. 

He deleted the profile in front of me and finally confessed that he had a short emotional affair with a former customer (he used to own a small construction business in town) whom he ran in to at the coffee shop he visits every day. 

I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs more to it, he says it never went further than flirtation that made him question us, and he claims when she told him she liked him, he put the kibosh on it.  I find this much more threatening than the AM profile as I know the majority of women on that are bots, versus a woman who actually lives in our town. 

I get intent is intent  but to his credit, whenever I bring it up he listens, doesn‚Äôt get defensive as he usually does and has been very transparent about his phone; never hesitates to show me texts, messages or apps. Honestly, he says he wants to be with me and I‚Äôm trying to move past it. I don‚Äôt want to dwell on what may have been. I‚Äôm not oblivious to how this looks but I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic.

We set a timeline of the beginning of the new year to figure out where we were at and what the next steps would be. 

 We have been trying to up the ante in terms of validating each other,  giving space when needed,  staying calm and being more physically affectionate, and unsurprisingly things been improving. 

Now what triggered this post: We opened gifts on Christmas Eve due to my stepdaughters (18f and 16f) having obligations with their bio mom. 

We had a budget this year as things have been tighter financially (hence why we‚Äôre trying to sell the house)  and I knew he would go over as he always does, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting the level at which he spent. I opened the box and in it was a large-stone engagement ring. 

It‚Äôs nice, but it‚Äôs not really something I would have picked for myself, and now after the shock has worn off,  I‚Äôm thinking of the money, and the significance of this. I don‚Äôt want to return it because I don‚Äôt want him to feel rejected but I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm not ungrateful I‚Äôm just confused. 

The whole thing just feels rushed and kind of fake and while I know Moissanite is an ethical, and affordable choice I would have rather he waited until we were better off financially and relationship-wise, and gotten a smaller real diamond if we both decided we wanted to go the ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù route. I may be old-fashioned, but I just feel like it‚Äôs more meaningful if it‚Äôs a real stone. 

I really haven‚Äôt had time to talk to him about this due to other family obligations and him  working today. I guess I‚Äôm just venting and trying to figure out what to say, if anything. 

I apologize for the length of this, but I thought context was important. I know this was a ride, but I promise it‚Äôs all true. ",1,1735232238.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

Just for the content- we started of our relationship in long distance since he was moving back to his country, we flew to each other when we had the chance just to spend our time together and finally he moved back to the country where I‚Äôm at to try to make this relationship works, and at the same time, he hated here ( we are both expats living in a middle eastern desert) 

I have to say he‚Äôs a nice guy, showed me all love, during the break up when he cried, I can tell he cried genuinely because of his stupidity.

We talked about our future, how would our family looks like, at the same time, they were still texting

They went for a coffee date behind my back when we were doing long distance

I found them texting from a pop up message on his laptop screen when I was sitting next to him when he was working 

He told me he will stop texting her if interacting with her makes me feel uncomfortable 

3 weeks later when I was sitting with him in front of his laptop whilst he was working, her message popped up again 

I confronted but never asked to look into their messages, he said that there were some flirtatious messages between them and they were still texting each other on a daily basis after he told me he will stop interacting with her

He said she is his type comparing to me ( but lol I am a very attractive person so I literally lol) 

He was the man I thought I will marry to one day since I never loved someone like how I loved him when we were together which hurts like hell

But then, it is his loss since he said he won‚Äôt be able to find anyone else like me loving him like this. 
I provided a very good apartment on my own for him since I‚Äôm earning a good salary and having a good job ( but he actually earned more comparing to me ) 

Cooked even I was exhausted after my 09:00 - 19:00 days because I wanted us to be in a good health 

Took him out over the weekends to get some sun even I felt like I wanted to stay in, but then he was mainly working from home at my apartment, I was worried about his mental health since he was trapped in my apartment all the time

Tried to contact their support team, not helpful. Now steam is coming out of the coffee group head instead of the steam wand, lol. I opened it up, the problem seems to be with the Chinese solenoid valve: JLT Series P3TA (its 120Volt). I am shocked to see that I can‚Äôt find this part anywhere. I heard the solenoid valves act up in all Breville models. Yet you can‚Äôt find a new one to replace it. You can‚Äôt even open it up. Even if you find its just too expensive.

Piece of advice: buy coffee machines that don‚Äôt make money of the parts not being available and you having to buy a new one right after the warranty is over. 

Search the core parts (such as pump and solenoid valve) to ensure they are available and fairly cheap BEFORE you buy a machine. Or alternatively I guess buy an extended warranty for parts.

I think it‚Äôs a well-engineered and -assembled machine, just the key parts within it, such as the valve and the pump and the flow meter, are not high quality and hard to find if they break, as they often do.",1,1735231865.0,BrevilleCoffee,1,1.0,False

1hmsa5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1hmsa5e/hiding_religion/,Hiding Religion ,"Hello,

I (33F) and my husband (34M) have been together for about 14 years, married about 8. We have two children under 6. 

We've known each other since we were teens, but we did not start dating until around age 20/21ish. We got married around age 25. Before marriage, I remember us having lengthy, detailed discussions about everything from our religious views (I am an atheist, and he consistently said he was maybe an agnostic with some idea of a god or power but nothing in particular), politics (I am on the left of the political spectrum but I have views that fall on both sides; he always insisted he was apathetic toward politics and didn't really care but he always thought socialized medicine was a good idea). Before getting married we also discussed having kids- we agreed that they would be taught about world religions but not instructed in any, but that we wouldn't stop them from participating in one they chose when they were old enough. 

Unfortunately a few days before Christmas (we celebrate an Americanized/secularized holiday), during a stressful time of a messy house, still-unwrapped presents, and too-little money, my spouse got mad at me for not washing his coffee pot and not taking the garbage out after he got home from a 12 hour shift (I worked from home while managing to care for both kids AND clean other parts of our home). We later sat down, I was expecting to get a piece of his mind about our house being messy and cluttery, as that used to be something I struggled with but really put forth effort to clean more and more often to leave us with a functional home each night. 

I was not scolded for a messy home- my husband got into a strange mood while being angry and told me he isn't angry about cleaning, but that I wouldn't know that because I don't ask. I was taken aback by this, as if I am consistently scolded for not cleaning and he gets mad about a dirty coffee pot and full garbage, that's what I assume will be the discussion. We consistently talk about the challenges from our children and work, and other family, so I was upset I might not be recognizing something. He ended up shaking as he told me he has been hiding his religious views from me ""for a while""; he couldn't tell me how long, but it sounds like since before we were married. He went on to discuss how he has had to hide his Christianity from me or else I would have judged him, he states someone gave him a Bible and he hid it in our garage for example, and he also went on to let me know he has to censor what media he consumes around me (tiktoks, YouTube etc) because I ""don't like very right wing"" things. 

(I have always been someone he came to for information - questions on politics, history, religions, other cultures, world events, because of my background in history and English, I have a knack for literacy and I always tell him things from different sources (left wing, right wing, ""neutral"", and when possible an global news source). We have had good conversations on a number of topics where I try to be as neutral as I can be, because that is only fair. I am honest with him when I don't know about a topic, or only know enough to have my own opinion or reaction.)

He went on to tell me that he never wanted to bring it up because he ""doesn't believe in divorce"" and doesn't want to lose me. He continued to say he will join an Church and intends to bring our children (at this point I couldn't respond as I am feeling very misled and shocked). He then told me that I give him a hard time without knowing because I don't fit into his vision of a future (a house in the middle of nowhere rural area, with a wife who does not work but cleans the home, and children who are ""not smart but have fun outside""). For reference, he picked our current home, in the middle of a decently nice suburb. He told me he wishes I would consider going to church with them in the future- I told him that is not something I would consider because I do not have faith in any deities and it would be a lie to pretend I do.

I am feeling shocked at this point, I can barely breathe, my fingernails are even turning kind of purple/gray. Looking back I think I was going into emotional shock. I have never misled him by thinking that was ever something that I wanted- I work (around his rotating schedule so we don't need childcare), I continued college while we were together, I am enthusiastic about women's political concerns etc.

I am feeling so misled and lied to- if he hid his religious views from me, that means he 1.) does not trust me, and 2.) he removed my ability to consent to marrying him in earnest and continuing the marriage. He is right that we wouldn't have married had he been upfront about his views and goals for what his future looks like- two people so incompatible together would be miserable (or, at least one of the partners would be). He ended the conversation by telling me he hates that I am a liberal and that he finds that disgusting.

He says I should have known he was extremely Christian and conservative since he has always liked ""riding quads and shooting"" (like target practice in the woods). I told him he should have been upfront because I feel like he has lid to me about something very fundamental, though I apologized to him because clearly I haven't been trustworthy enough to talk to.

I am just looking for advice. I have been wracking my brain trying to figure out where I have gone wrong. It has been a few days of crying, I told him I don't want to discuss it further until after the holidays. I am going to ask him to try therapy, even both of us in marriage counseling, or that I want to do a trial separation.

Sincerely,

A wife feeling very sad right now 

Tldr; husband witheld his deeply differing religious views from me until after we were married with children 

Update 1: things I forgot to mention 
- he indicated he knows he has been very mean to me for the last few months, in his words he has been trying to reconcile me not fitting in with his world view
- he told me he stopped watching porn because it is sinful; I let him know as long as he is not struggling with porn addiction I do not mind him watching it, but he said he has stopped
-he mentioned he has been trying not to do things that are sins, but he couldn't really elaborate. He seemed worried about sinning. I was confused about this as he doesn't smoke and rarely drinks and as far as I know he doesn't gamble, and in normal circumstances he is polite to others",1,1735231602.0,Marriage,10,1.0,False

I have been visiting that place for almost two decades now whenever I feel like going. Over the years, I have observed that the size of the Dosei has reduced drastically, becoming smaller and smaller, while the price keeps increasing. A decade ago, CTR's Dosei had a unique taste, but now it feels like just any other random restaurant.

Recently, my TL came from the US for a vacation here. He specifically wanted to explore Malleshwaram and other prominent areas of the city, so I took him around the area. We eventually went to CTR because he wanted to try the Dosei there. There was a very long queue, but we waited, got inside, ordered Dosei, and later had filter coffee at By2Coffee opposite CTR.

While having coffee, I asked him to review the Dosei we ate at CTR. His response was: ""To be honest, it was not good. Before coming here, I had pudi masala Dosei at Rameshwaram Cafe and Mysore masala Dosei in Mysore, and they were actually better than the Dosei here.""

Afterward, we walked to Veena Stores, had idly, adam milk, and then parted ways.

I have been thinking about this for a few days now. It‚Äôs not just him‚Äîmany people have told me the same thing. They say they no longer find anything special about CTR's Dosei anymore.

\- Just studying from MS Learn documentation and free exam tests, did not cut out for me. I got too tired from that much reading, as the Microsoft Learn page is not very ""eye friendly"". Of course, they assure that the MS Learn free exam is not similar to the MD-102 exam, but for real, it is NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEGIN.

\- I started buying the John Christopher's Udemy Course, and with that i entered the Microsoft Intune world, as i had no experience AT ALL with this technology. This was a 40% of the knowledge i gathered but with this i learned things in a ""superficial"" way so i knew i needed to get deeper, into details...

\- With this information learned from the Udemy course, i could set my own little environment. Basically setup a VM with W11, sync it with intune, and start deploying and working on a single VM to practice a little. 20% of learning here.

\- So I bought the MD-102 MeasureUp Practice Test. It has almost 160 questions that you can set up for an exam or practice environment. This helped me for the final 40%... i learned a lot from repeating the exam in both variations, as it was actually the best way for me to learn the little thingys, the details, the minimal stuff.

\- I'm from Argentina, hence my native language is Spanish. Since this exam's update was recent, i couldn't find any documentation written in Spanish (aside from the MS Learn's), so i had to study everything in English. I guess im just proud of been able to do that...

Having said all that, i conclude with this:

It is NOT an easy exam, i really sweat a LOT the last 15 minutes since i had almost 20 questions ahead of me. Each question was larger that the last.... so my advice would be on trying to not spend to much time on each question. they give you 2 hours. 59 questions and 1 case to solve. To be honest, last 15 questions were just me banging on the first thing that sound logic to me, and i think that drinking a coffee before the exam, did and did not help me, because my heart was out of my chest but it helped me through the quick thinking.

But, guys, if you study from all the resources available, not just the ones that Microsoft puts available for you... i think that you all have a chance at first try.

That is really all i have to say. I wish you all the luck, but mostly i wish you sleep well, eat well, drink a coffee, and do everything you see fit and necessary to be important before doing the exam, and you will succeed.",8,1735231437.0,O365Certification,2,1.0,False

1hms74d,https://www.reddit.com/r/WWU/comments/1hms74d/protesting_fossil_fuel_trade/,Protesting Fossil Fuel Trade,"Hey, I'm curious if any of you guys would be interested in organizing a protest to severe the production and transportation of coal and oil at a local level.

In 2016 [protesters in Bellingham](https://nwcitizen.com/entry/coal-trains-blocked-by-local-protestors/writer/39) successfully stopped BNSF from exporting coal to Canada by blocking off the train tracks, but the stand only lasted 12 hours. Seeing the support behind student protests recently I think we could build a much longer standing wall. Demand immediate reduction in coal exports and carbon emissions, as well as a downtown Amtrak station with more frequent routes to Seattle and Portland. Coal and freight is loud, I don't want it rumbling through our city through late hours in the night. 

Another idea would be to cut off road access to oil refineries in the area. Cherry Point is the largest refinery in Washington and processes a quarter million barrels per day and would require multiple cutoff points to coordinate a full shutdown. A more realistic option could be the March's Point refinery in Anacortes which processes 120,000 barrels a day. March's Point Park and Ride requires only one connecting bus from downtown Bellingham. The parking lot has multiple covered shelters, lots of open room for tents, and an independent coffee shop/ cafe.

We need immediate decarbonization and we have to force it at a local level. These are my desperate attempts of brainstorming radical sollutions.

Context: Hi! This will be my second time posting here in Reddit. My first post was actually with regards to being torpe or does it turn u off if yung guy is torpe kinda thing. 

In my previous post I mentioned that I liked someone for a long time. But I didn't made a move all this time because I felt that I can't go at par with her on anyway possible. Yung tipong ang liit ng tingin mo sa sarili mo na kahit pwede kang mag try to make a move sa tao is di ko ginawa kase kase she's way out if my league. Suntok sa buwan, just like what I've said sa previous post ko. So admire2 lang talaga ako since 2021 ata. We talked but not on a level na sobrang close nyo na. Like you knew each other online pero di naman den ganon ka lalim ang interactions nyo. Pero we used to play PUBG and CODM na duo. Well, das a fault on my behalf kase whenever den nag uusap kami, di talaga ako maka isip nang sensible na pwde naming pag usapan. Na totorpe talaga ako pag dating sa kanya. Hence, even if I wanted too is nag restrain nlng ako kase di naman den ako worthy parang ganon. Aside from that I'm also very insecure sa face ko kase may mga pimp marks hehehe tapos while this girl very beautiful. 

Then, recently because of a dare game naka amin ako sa kanya. After that, my friends told me na why not try this time total nasabe ko na den. I love my comfort zone, but nasagi din sa isip ko na oo nga why not try. Why not try to express my admiration or ""feelings"" ko sa kanya. Wala naman sigurong mawawala. 

So eto na niyaya ko syang magkita kami. Like coffee shop and to watch a movie. To be honest, her saying yes on my invitation was the least thing the I expect to happen. Like, I'm a nobody. In fact, after I asked her I uninstalled my IG kase natakot ako na baka ang creepy ko or baka na wewirdohan sya sa saken. But to my surprise, she actually said yes. So I immediately made a plan for our first ever gala. 

Both of us are working as VA. So medj hectic then sched namin. We moved the schedule couple of times. But tomorrow will be the big day. Just want to know kung pano bah maging confident? I made a list of anong pwede kong ma bring up na topic namen pero I know myself eh. Whenever I'm anxious/nervous nawawala talaga ako. Knowing na sya den kasama ko bukas. Baka ma ulol nako. I'm excited but anxious at the same time. Huhu need some advice kung pano maging confident and mag less yung kaba kase na wowory den ako baka ang pangit ko dahil sa pimp marks ko mas nawawala confidence ko talaga. I know den naman na di ako ang gusto nun kase parang impossible ren ü•π

","Listen up regards, ive been going to $BROS since 2017 back when they only had 1 branch in a small college town in Colorado and seen them expand across the entire state over a few years. Yes i know ‚Äúthe lines are always long‚Äù yeah ‚Äúthey‚Äôre competing with starbucks ‚Äú yap yap yeah they got the lisa su of coffee in christine barone as the new CEO but shut it and hear me out. I'm gonna tell you why this company is gonna fk up your grandma's inheritance way quicker than you can count to Gee Em EE (yes im throwing shade at our beloved regards at super stonk). If you genuinely bought that stock that shall not be named, you should actually buy BROS since you've likely been donating to the market for years anyway¬†

**Less Blondes, More ‚ÄúWTF is that thing that took my order?‚Äù**

When I first started going to Dutch Bros, every morning was basically a softcore caffeine porno. 10/10 baristas smiling at you, making your day less miserable before you go back to being a wage cuck at whatever bs remote job you do. Now I show up and I‚Äôm greeted by some purple haired thing named Skylar. The amount of rainbow employees i've been seeing at different locations has made me gag, If I genuinely wanted a questionable gender-fluid experience, I‚Äôd just invest in coins again. Now I just go to $SBUX to get served by underpaid but a cute WOMAN. idc what you say, you can‚Äôt put a P/E on ‚Äúno boner, no brew.‚Äù¬†

**Healthier Options = Brain Activity = Lost Sales**¬†

look, I go to Dutch Bros because I want 500 grams of sugar in a single gulp. I‚Äôm not here to think about the caloric content of my caramel macchi-whatever-the-fuck. Studies (these are harvard studies if you cucks wanna try and question me) show that when you force customers to think, you lose money. Give me my diabetes-in-a-cup and let me die happy. Also who the fuck buys a protein coffee, get a grip .

**Competition is Thiccker than a Nikola motors truck**¬†

Expansion is a bitch when you‚Äôre trying to out-coffee Starbucks, Dunkin‚Äô, and every bearded hipster in a food truck. You really think $BROS can find prime corners in big cities when SBUX has already claimed every intersection and half the alleyways? Good luck with that. They might as well set up shop in the middle of bumfuck iowa at least they‚Äôll have a monopoly there.

**Real Estate: From Tiny Shacks to Big-Ass Buildings**

The beauty of Dutch Bros was their huts‚Äîlittle shacks that cost roughly the same as an average tiny 3d printed home. Now I‚Äôm seeing thicker stores with actual indoor/outdoor seating, meaning sky-high overhead.¬†

If you're regarded: More real estate = more capital expenses = less margin. you start letting customers inside, and guess what? They might linger, think about what they‚Äôre buying and worst of all might even realize they can just make their own coffee at home like a finance guru on¬† youtube

**Expansion Costs & Financial Fuckery**

Yea yea $BROS wants to open 1,500 stores in the next decade. Each new location can cost up to \~$1M in capex (im sure ur all have finance degrees and know what this means). With an average check size that barely pays your rent (assuming you ever move out of your mom‚Äôs basement) or even covers a 3d printed house , that‚Äôs a metric shit-ton of $9 coffees just to break even.Meanwhile, $SBUX is sitting on every corner, flexing their global supply chain and brand recognition. And where are the profits?? Last quarter, $BROS had a net loss of around $16 million while ‚Äúexpanding.‚Äù Their operating margin makes my match rate on hinge look good. Their P/S ratio implies theyre the TSLA of coffee, but let‚Äôs face it they can only dream of . To add onto this their new CEO looks more bullish on $MCD than she is on $BROS, christin barron if you're reading this: sign up for equinox, get you some $PTON, and maybe ill buy some of your shares.

The only bullish thing is that their CEO is a whale (and not the kind that buys shares) meaning she probably buys her own produce¬†

**TL;DR: if you hate skinny women, love to lose money or both. buy $BROS**

**My Position:**¬†5 Puts, $25 Strike, jan 15 2027 ( I dont have a job rn i wouldve shorted 10600 shares )

1hmrzxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hmrzxm/water_makes_an_insane_difference/,Water makes an insane difference,"This topic has probably been beat to death, but I really experienced first hand this morning how much water matters.

I had been struggling with my coffee for a year or so now as it was always coming out too acidic. I drink light roasts and love the fruity/juicy/tea-like brews that I‚Äôd get in some great cafes. I could never get that type of cup at home.

I live in an area with soft water (NYC). On its own, coffee is pretty good, but not cafe quality mostly because of the chlorine content. I added a 3-stage water filter and that got rid of the chlorine taste but left my coffee tasting a little more acidic and astringent (probably because I was over extracting to even out the acidity). So I thought that maybe this acidity was due to tasting the coffee more now that the water was ‚Äúpure‚Äù because on its own the water tasted completely free of chlorine and the other bad qualities of tap water. I tried changing grinders, grind sizes, percolation vs immersion vs hybrid, recipes, temperatures. These changes helped but never fixed the main issue.

And that issue was my water‚Äî so, today I decided to experiment with water recipes. I tried 1) tap water, 2) filtered water, 3) filtered water with a bit of sodium bicarbonate and magnesium sulfate, 4) filtered water using Third Wave Water classic light roast. All same brewing method/recipe.

The TWW with filtered water got me to basically 90% what I experience in good cafes. It is crazy how different it tastes to the strictly filtered water. Tap water was ultimately better than the filtered water  too, but it was less ‚Äúclear‚Äù and you can taste the chlorine through it a bit. The sodium bicarb/mg sulfate was not as good as TWW, that could just be the recipe I used, though.

TWW was by far the best of all the conditions and I‚Äôm excited to experiment with it a bit more. Hope this helps some folks out there that are maybe just starting out or having similar issues.",14,1735230823.0,pourover,7,0.9,False
1hmry9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKParenting/comments/1hmry9q/faking_a_medical_issue_to_get_a_night_off/,Faking a medical issue to get a night off ,"I just want to vent. 

I plan to fake a medical issue, pretending I'm going to hospital but instead I'm going to check into a hotel for one night. 

I beg you to hear me out. 

I have a 2 year old and 7 week old. I live with my husband and my MIL has come to stay for a few months to help us out. 

My body is broken from pregnancy, labour, delivery, no sleep and round the clock breastfeeding (my husband gives the baby a bottle of expressed milk during his shift so I can get 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep). He holds this over me at any opportunity. I lost 2L of blood postpartum and had to have a transfusion and I feel I still haven't recovered. I get absolutely no sympathy. Please note, my husband has been off work for the whole of Dec due to annual and paternity leave. 

My husband has been ill with flu-like symptoms since Monday. He's not gotten out of bed since. My toddler caught the same thing and I spent 6 hours in A+E last night. I had to express breastmilk in A+E (in the breastfeeding room) so I wouldn't get mastitis. Ideally my husband should have gone but he was too sick. He refuses to seek medical attention and says it will just pass. I've been solo parenting during this time. 

My MIL is very helpful but is babying my husband. I just told him to man up, drink coffee and get on with it. My MIL and I had an argument because she thinks I'm being too harsh on my husband. She thinks I don't do enough. When my husband and his siblings were younger, my FIL was useless and stay-at-home MIL did everything for the children. She thinks I should do the same. I reminded her that traditional gender roles are ok but I earn x3 more than my husband. So maybe he should get a better job so I can stay at home with the kids. Or maybe they can give us a couple of grand every month to help with bills (I was very annoyed and just said whatever). 

I've had enough and I'm going to jump out of the window if I don't get a night off. I don't need medical attention, just a night off. I can't tell my husband this because he won't understand and I'm outnumbered because his mum is here. 

So I'm thinking of faking a postpartum medical issue and telling them I'm going to A+E. Instead I'm going to go to a hotel, order room service and sleep. I have a stash of breastmilk in the freezer for the baby and she takes a bottle just fine. I will express milk when I'm in the hotel for the baby. My toddler is on antibiotics, he's well and will be just fine without me for 1 night. 

Obviously, I will never utter a word of this to anyone in real life so I'm getting it off my chest here.

So, about a month ago I was at work drinking coffee with milk, about an hour later I had a very bad panic attack, palpitations, my heart was pounding so bad I could feel it in my chest, dizzyness, short of breath, shaking .. one of my coworkers told me to check my blood pressure, I did and it was so high like 180/110, this triggered my anxiety even more, I went to the ER but by the time I got there I was already feeling a little better, anyways I didn't know exactly why this happened to me back then, but I cut caffeine just incase, I don't drink it everyday, maybe 3 cups a week and I've never had this happen to me, fast forward to today, was at work, only slept for like 5 hrs or so, I was feeling a bit tired I decided to drink a cup of coffee, 15 minutes later, the exact same panic attack, I tried to controll it a bit this time, instead of checking my blood pressure and making me feel even worse, I went for a 30 min walk and tried to deep breath as much as I could and drank a lot of water, I tried to not let my brain trick me like the previous time with thoughts that I'm about to have a heart attack and other bad thoughts, started feeling better slowly, this happened 4 hours ago but I really still feel like shit, I'm just so confused why is my body reacting to caffeine different than before?",1,1735230295.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

1hmrq8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1hmrq8q/should_i_quit_my_t15_mba_after_1st_semester/,Should I quit my T15 MBA after 1st semester?,"Hi, I‚Äôm currently a full-time MBA student at a T15 school. After the first semester, I‚Äôm considering dropping out. I‚Äôd appreciate any advice on this.

**Context:** I‚Äôm 29M. Got my UG and master‚Äôs in science from a top research university. Worked as a biotech researcher, later managed a team. I got offers from an M7 and a T15. After some research and coffee chats, I didn‚Äôt see much of a difference, so I chose the T15 since it‚Äôs closer to home and cheaper.

After the first semester, I summarized my experience:

1. **Academics:** Great. I really like my professors and classes. Tbh, academics have been the best part of the MBA for me (probably an unpopular opinion).¬†
2. **Personal social life:** I live with my partner and have close non-MBA friends and a few MBA classmates to hang out with. Overall, I‚Äôm pretty happy with my personal life.
3. **Job hunting:** My post-MBA goal is to pivot into management consulting. I‚Äôve received a couple of internship interviews, so I feel lucky compared to many peers in this economy. During the process, a consultant I spoke with mentioned that my experience might help me land a full-time consulting role even without an MBA. That made me start to question whether an MBA is really necessary for the pivot.
4. **MBA Peer Network:** I‚Äôm frustrated. I‚Äôve learned that the core value of an MBA is supposed to be networking, so I‚Äôve put in the effort. I‚Äôve gone to events, HH, and parties. I‚Äôm focused on getting to know people, and I don‚Äôt care about being popular. By the end of the semester, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve built some rapport (or at least had small talk) with about half of my classmates and some MBA2s.  My friends who graduated from M7s told me to ‚Äútalk to classmates who‚Äôve worked at MBB, IB, startups‚Ä¶ MBA is all about networking. For example, some ex-MBB can help refer you to their former employers‚Ä¶‚Äù. Now, I realize that they were biased. In reality, I‚Äôve only met a couple of ex-management consultants in my program. I haven‚Äôt had as many intellectual conversations as I‚Äôd expected. At this point, I don‚Äôt see myself investing more time and energy in alcohol and parties. I‚Äôm not sure if my MBA friends exaggerated their experiences, or if their cohorts really were that different from mine.
5. **long term network:** The alum network hasn‚Äôt been particularly impressive either. Based on what I‚Äôve observed, most alums seem to plateau at mid-management roles. There are some outliers, but they‚Äôre rare.

**My Questions:**

Q1: How much does the long-term MBA network matter in someone‚Äôs career? Does it really make a difference if there are five partners from X school and only one from Y school at a company? Or is it more of an ego game?  
Q2: For those who‚Äôve attended an M7, is the student body and alum network significantly better? Or is this just how MBAs are in general? If I‚Äôve misunderstood the value of networking in business school, I‚Äôd love to hear your perspective. How should I approach social aspects with my MBA peers?

**TL;DR**

My T15 program is great overall. I enjoy the classes and have positive job traction (though I might be able to pivot without an MBA). The network aspect frustrated me. I feel like the peer and alumni networks are supposed to be the unique value of an MBA, but I don‚Äôt think my willingness to pay is $200K for what I‚Äôm getting. Or maybe I just don‚Äôt fully understand how to approach it.

My wife and I postponed our plan to buy a home to support my MBA, and I‚Äôm really struggling to justify this investment. I‚Äôm seriously thinking about cutting my losses now before the tuition deadline for the spring semester.

I know it's pretty hard to give strangers personal advice like this, but any opinions are welcome. Thank you very much!",6,1735230089.0,MBA,14,0.75,False

Almost immediately they had something backup into the shower. It stained the shower a yellowish color (around the drain) even after a thorough cleaning. It happened again soon after the shower installation was completed. We thought it was fixed after they cleared out a tree root that had grown into a pipe. Unfortunately it has happened twice in the past couple of weeks.

I was in the bathroom when it happened last. I heard a gurgle sound and soon started to smell a horrible rotten smell (maybe on the sweet side). It didn't smell like poop or rotten eggs to me. I looked in the shower and there was brown specks and liquid resting at the drain. The brown specks looked like coffee grounds or soil. Nothing plambing related was running (last plumber thought it might be due to the dishwasher running).

When we were leaving, he went towards the napkin dispenser and glares at me going, ""Napkins?""

I told him, ""Oh, no. I don't need it. I'll eat my sandwich at the picnic table  
at the park.""

He's infuriated I don't grab the napkins or want them. He storms pass me  
without looking at me.

I don't see what the fuss is, so I say, ""Well, I mean if you want them for your car? I don't need them.""

In the car, he's storming.  
""I don't know why you have to be so difficult. 'Oh, you'll just eat your sandwich at the park?'""  
""Yeah, I thought you were asking me if I wanted napkins, not telling me I have to use them.""  
""You can't really be that incompetent.""  
""I don't see what the big deal is. I'm not trying to tick you off. I just thought you were worried  
I might get crumbs in your car, if I ate there, so I'd eat the sandwich at the park. By that logic,  
I wasn't making a mess, and we're fine.""  
""No, it's because your hands will be greasy.""  
I start crying because I don't know what's fucking wrong or what the big deal is.  
""Why are you so cruel?""  
""I am NOT cruel for having you use napkins.""  
""I just thought it was about the crumbs. Your tone and going off on me is cruel. Why are you doing this on Christmas Eve? I thought you were just asking me if I wanted them, I wasn't trying to be sarcastic.""

I tried bringing it up with him later after we cooled down.

""I still don't know what went wrong at Starbucks. I really wasn't trying to make a mess in your car or embarrass you. You could've just grabbed the napkins and ask me to use them.""  
""You really think this is about napkins? You really are retarded.""  
""You won't tell me what's up, so yeah.""

I think his approach and communication style is ridiculous. I think he has cleaning requirements that he needs to communicate gently upfront. And I'm sick of being called retarded for breaking rules I didn't know existed. I would not go off on someone about napkins in the car. If it was a need he told me about, I'd oblige. I don't care that much. But I wouldn't belittle or demean someone and hold unspoken cleaning reqs against them for it. ",26,1735229933.0,relationship_advice,118,0.66,False

I corrected it a little‚Äîmaybe this time it gets published.**

**Well, I don‚Äôt use English daily, and I‚Äôve always been terrible with past tenses. Also, I might be a bit drunk.**

Please forgive me for any mistakes.

So, basically, we have this family chat on WhatsApp. We mostly use it to exchange photos, links, and memes, but it‚Äôs also kind of a bulletin board where people post announcements about upcoming family gatherings and events. When I joined, I muted it almost immediately because my phone kept blowing up with endless photos of kids doing kid stuff. I love my family, but at some point, I was just *done*. I‚Äôm a terrible person, I know.

Still, I‚Äôve never worried about missing a party because my mom is super responsible and always calls me in advance to remind me.

So, this Friday, my mom called me.

**Mom:** Do you remember the housewarming party on Saturday?  
**Me:** The housewarming *what*‚Ä¶?  
**Mom:** John and Dorothy‚Äôs party. It starts at 4 p.m. Check WhatsApp.

Somewhere deep in my brain, a lightbulb lit up. My cousins had discussed this party almost two months ago at the last family gathering, and‚Äîoh, right‚ÄîI had agreed to come.

So, I decided to bake an apple pie. Everybody in my family loves apple pie, and it‚Äôs quick and easy. You can‚Äôt go wrong with a good apple pie.

Unfortunately, I worked overtime on Friday and didn‚Äôt finish until 7 p.m. That meant I had to buy apples from a big supermarket instead of the better-quality ones at the market. I was still hoping to find some nice sour apples, the only ones suitable for baking. Well, of course, the supermarket had about five types of apples, none of them good for baking. I cursed under my breath, googled the types I didn‚Äôt recognize, and went with the least juicy ones.

The next day, I baked the pie. It looked perfectly normal (great), so I was hopeful. At 4 p.m., the pie was packed, I was in my coat, and I was ready to go. The party had officially started at 4 p.m., but I was planning to arrive at 5 p.m.‚Äîfashionably late, as always.

I opened the WhatsApp group to check the address.

Well, fuck.

Dorothy had specifically asked everyone *not* to bring food because they had catering and didn‚Äôt want anything to go to waste.

Moreover, they‚Äôd shared a list of gift ideas on SharePoint. It was a fantastic list, including cheap options like ‚Ç¨5 glasses from IKEA and more expensive items like a coffee set. Unfortunately, all the cheap items left were only available online, which wasn‚Äôt an option for me.

But there was one gift they wanted in unlimited amounts: **plants**.

I thought: *OH MY GOD, GREAT!* They even included a list of plants safe for kids and pets‚Äîand a list of toxic ones.

Reading the second list, I realized my two dogs and my cat were probably very lucky to still be alive, considering that every single plant I own is on the toxic list.

When dressing for the party, I went full casual. What does that mean? Well, I have this two-month-old pile of washed clothes sitting on my desk, waiting in vain to be ironed. I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs at the bottom of the pile anymore. Each morning, I dig through it, fish out some random clothes, grab two mismatched socks, and head to work. My family and coworkers know me, so they‚Äôve learned to accept my ‚Äúhobo look.‚Äù

This day was no different. I chose grey leggings that had seen better days, a wrinkled white sweater, and two mismatched socks‚Äîone white, one grey with stripes.

I hadn‚Äôt washed my hair either, so I threw it into a greasy half-ponytail with a random scrunchie. I didn‚Äôt even bother brushing it.

Looking like a true lady, I jumped into my car and drove to the nearest DIY store with a plant section.

I found a plant from the safe list, all right.

As a matter of fact, I might as well have walked into the store and yelled, ‚ÄúGIVE ME THE MOST EXPENSIVE PLANT YOU HAVE.‚Äù

It was a magnificent areca palm, tall as hell. I wasn‚Äôt even sure it would fit in my car.

**‚Ç¨45.**

I was running really late and still needed a pot, soil, and LECA. The only nice pot I could find was ‚Ç¨50.

In total, with LECA and soil, I spent ‚Ç¨100 instead of ‚Ç¨5 for IKEA glasses like my clever cousin Johanna, who had claimed that item a month ago.

So, there I was, in my white sweater, in a freezing 3¬∞C parking lot, repotting the fucking areca.

I finished, begged the areca not to die from the cold, and went to clean my hands‚Äîonly to discover that my white sweater was no longer white. I tried to clean it, but that only left it soaked and covered in a massive muddy stain.

Ah, perfect.

But it‚Äôs just my close family, right? They know me and accept me as I am.

On the way to the party, some jerk cut me off, and I had to slam on the brakes.

Two things happened:

* The leftover bag of soil spilled all over the passenger seat, floor, and poor areca.
* Most of the areca‚Äôs leaves broke off.

Still, the pot was nice. I figured they could always replant something else in it. It‚Äôs just my family, right?

Well, wrong.

I mean, I should have guessed. They *did* write that they ordered catering, and who the hell orders catering for 10‚Äì15 people? Especially when it‚Äôs just a housewarming party and supposed to be a small family gathering‚Ä¶?

So, I entered my cousins‚Äô house and proceeded to the dining room.

I fucking froze.

There were like **50 people** there.

All the elders were dressed elegantly, and the younger generations looked like they were heading to a business-casual office party.

And then there was me.

Standing there in my once-upon-a-time white sweater, with greasy hair, mismatched socks, and a half-demolished plant in my hands.

**An evening to remember, for sure.**

I will never, ever mute the family chat again.

**TL;DR:** Muted family chat on WhatsApp. Didn‚Äôt read updates. Showed up almost 3 hours late to a formal party with greasy hair, mismatched socks, a muddy sweater, and a ‚Ç¨100 plant I destroyed while driving there. Never muting family chat again.",92,1735229862.0,tifu,11,0.8,False

Just for the content- we started of our relationship in long distance since he was moving back to his country, we flew to each other when we had the chance just to spend our time together and finally he moved back to the country where I‚Äôm at to try to make this relationship works, and at the same time, he hated here ( we are both expats living in a middle eastern desert) 

I have to say he‚Äôs a nice guy, showed me all love, during the break up when he cried, I can tell he cried genuinely because of his stupidity.

We talked about our future, how would our family looks like, at the same time, they were still texting

They went for a coffee date behind my back when we were doing long distance

I found them texting from a pop up message on his laptop screen when I was sitting next to him when he was working 

He told me he will stop texting her if interacting with her makes me feel uncomfortable 

3 weeks later when I was sitting with him in front of his laptop whilst he was working, her message popped up again 

I confronted but never asked to look into their messages, he said that there were some flirtatious messages between them and they were still texting each other on a daily basis after he told me he will stop interacting with her

He said she is his type comparing to me ( but lol I am a very attractive person so I literally lol) 

He was the man I thought I will marry to one day since I never loved someone like how I loved him when we were together which hurts like hell

But then, it is his loss since he said he won‚Äôt be able to find anyone else like me loving him like this. 
I provided a very good apartment on my own for him since I‚Äôm earning a good salary and having a good job ( but he actually earned more comparing to me ) 

Cooked even I was exhausted after my 09:00 - 19:00 days because I wanted us to be in a good health 

Took him out over the weekends to get some sun even I felt like I wanted to stay in, but then he was mainly working from home at my apartment, I was worried about his mental health since he was trapped in my apartment all the time 

Tried to amend my cooking to his preference since  we are from different ethnicity 

I felt like i compromised a lot (which i totally okay with it since there will be compromises in any relationship) 

But in the end, he still choose a girl over me and this precious connection, who has a sugar daddy and at the same time, cheating on her current boyfriend with that sugar daddy, same time texting my ex, WTF
