However, when I worked at a freight forwarder as an agent there was NO down time, constant new EDIs coming through that needed to be worked on asap.

Are there any jobs within supply chain that’s a typical 9-5? As in, having SOME down time where you aren’t rushing to make sure edis are worked in time or dumpster fires with freight issues everyday? I swear I couldn’t even go make a cup of coffee without someone wondering where I was and why something isn’t being worked on for that 5 minutes. It was extremely draining. My managers were working til 10pm at night and every weekend.

1ibca2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1ibca2k/embracing_change_julias_path_to_her_childhood/,"Embracing Change: Julia’s Path to Her Childhood Dream (fiction, inspirational, life)","After a profound conversation with an old, wise woman, forty five year old Julia decides to completely change her life and finally pursue her childhood dream. She thinks she’ll never see the old woman—whom she owes everything to—again, but she’s wrong...

———-

Ordinary. That’s how Julia is seen by her neighbours and colleagues. An unremarkable woman. Julia, in fact, thinks so too. Every morning, she gets into her light blue Ford Ka and leaves the quiet Dutch countryside village, driving the half hour into the city for work. She’s always the first to arrive at the office, turns on the lights, brews a pot of coffee, and sorts the mail for her colleagues. Once that’s done, Julia settles at her desk and spends the rest of the day answering the phone, most of which she redirects to one of the six accountants in the office.

Julia is happily single, as they say. She’s had boyfriends in the past, but nothing ever turned serious. She doesn’t think much about it. She was always a bit of a loner as a child, and she’s just as comfortable being by herself now. She enjoys her cozy one-bedroom apartment, and when she’s not there, she’s probably outdoors, in nature, taking a long walk or bike ride. Especially in the spring, when there are chicks and lambs everywhere. Yes, Julia is content, or so it seems.

Sometimes, after work or on weekends, Julia goes visits the organic store near her office where she buys fresh vegetables and eggs. As usual, she takes a moment for herself and orders a fresh mint tea with a slice of warm apple pie—made with organic apples, of course. She always enjoys her treat in ‘her’ little corner by the window, letting the day’s moment pass her by.

Today is no different. It’s a Saturday, the sun is shining brightly, and it’s pleasantly warm. A perfect May day. Since the weather is so nice, Julia decides to bike into the city. She has no rush, so she can take her time. Her bike has handy bags on both sides to store her groceries.

During her bike ride through the country side with its rows of pollarded willows, Julia takes a deep breath of the fresh air and squinting her eyes for a moment. This is how she wants to experience the day—letting life soak in. She parks her bike in front of the organic store, beneath a gigantic chestnut tree. The tree might not stand out in winter, but now that it’s in bloom, you can see just how massive it is. Its canopy stretches almost across the entire square, with only a few gaps where sunlight filters through. The owner of the organic store has placed wooden benches under the tree, allowing people to sit in the shade. Julia decides to sit down on one of those benches to enjoy her mint tea and apple pie.

Carrying her tray, she steps through the glass door and looks for a spot with a bit of sun, so her legs can soak up some much-needed warmth—they haven’t seen any sunhine in months.

“Good morning, miss,” a voice says suddenly.

Julia opens her eyes, having briefly closed them to enjoy the peace of the sunlight. She blinks, letting her eyes adjust to the bright light. Raising her left hand above her eyebrows to shield her eyes, she finally sees the source of the voice: an older woman.

“Good morning, ma’am,” Julia replies.

“May I sit next to you on this bench?” the woman asks.

“Of course,” Julia says. “There’s plenty of room for both of us.” She pulls her crocheted vest a little closer to her body to make room for the woman.

“Ahh, that’s better,” the woman sighs as she sits down beside Julia. “I really needed that.”

“Really?” Julia asks. “Have you been that busy?”

“Well,” the woman replies, “those little ones are a lot of fun, but they take up so much attention and energy.” She points to two children playing on the grass beneath the tree.

“A twin set,” the woman adds, without Julia asking.

“How cute,” says Julia.

“So, grandma’s looking after them today?” Julia asks, a bit surprised.

“Haha, yes, yes, something like that,” the woman answers. “Although I’m not actually their grandma. But that’s how the kids see me, and I like it.”

“And you?” the woman asks. “Are you enjoying this lovely weather?”

“Yes, definitely,” Julia replies. “These moments are so rare, so I take them whenever I can.”

“Oh?” the woman says, surprised. “Do you also have such a busy life? I mean, I hear so many people saying they’re busy, constantly.”

“I’m usually indoors for my job,” Julia says. “Only on weekends do I get to be outside really. The whole week, I’m sitting behind a computer and a phone.”

“Oh dear. Do you enjoy your work?” the woman asks.

Julia falls silent for a moment, then answers, “I don’t really think about it much. It’s not unpleasant. But enjoyable? Does work have to be enjoyable?”

The woman looks at her, then shifts her gaze to the right. Julia, in turn, looks back at her. A brief silence falls between them.

“Do you think life should be enjoyable?” the woman asks, still watching Julia closely.

“I think so,” Julia answers. “But... I’m not sure. Maybe it’s something I need to think about more.”

The woman studies Julia for a moment before speaking again.

“Yes, that’s right. But you're not sure. That’s something worth considering.”

Julia stares ahead, lost in thoughts. The twins are still playing in front of them, but she’s too distracted to notice for a while.

“Hmm,” Julia says, but more to herself. “Yes. Yes, I do think life should be enjoyable. Or at least, we should try to make it as enjoyable as we can. What’s the point otherwise, right?”

She turns to the woman, and their eyes meet once again.

“Do you do that?” the woman asks.

Julia smiles but says nothing. They sit in silence, exchanging a knowing look.

“Can I ask you something?” the woman says.

“Of course,” Julia replies. “We’re talking already, right?”

“Do you remember what interested you as a child? What did you love doing?” the woman asks.

Julia pauses. “Phew, that’s a good question,” she says with a thoughtful smile. “Here I am, sitting outside on a bench on a beautiful Saturday morning, unexpectedly digging into my past at the request of a stranger!”

“We can stop if you like,” the woman says gently. “It’s not my intention to make you uncomfortable.”

“No, not at all,” Julia responds quickly. “In fact, for the first time in a long time, I’m thinking about my life again. And yes, I remember what I loved doing as a child.”

“Tell me,” the woman encourages.

Julia takes a sip of her fresh mint tea, gazes dreamily ahead, then takes another sip before speaking.

“My grandparents had several fruit trees behind their house,” Julia begins. “We visited my “opa and oma” almost every week. Every summer, I kept an eye on the apples and pears during each visit.”

“Sometimes, the fruit would fall to the grass before it was ripe. I’d pick it up and put it in a crate. Then when the crate was full, I’d play shopkeeper. I didn’t actually sell anything, of course, but I’d pretend I had my own fruit and vegetable shop.”

“I loved doing that. I remember clearly that I dreamed of having fruit trees in my own garden when I grew up and selling all kinds of fruit. And making applesauce—no, papplesauce—because I’d mix pears and apples together. That’s what I imagined.”

Julia takes another sip of her mint tea and continues “In my memories, I was always playing in the garden, under the fruit trees, in the summer and fall months.”

“I can see it in your eyes,” the woman says softly. “Those memories are still alive. Your eyes are sparkling.”

“Yes,” Julia says dreamily. “That’s true. And you know, this is the first time in years I’ve even thought about it. All this time, it’s been a memory locked away, a thing of the past.”

Julia turns to the woman, who’s been watching her attentively the entire time.

“I’m actually a little taken aback,” Julia admits. “You’ve made me think with that one question. But it also confuses me, because I’m not sure what to do with that thought now.”

“That’s understandable,” the woman says with a knowing smile. “You know, I went through something similar many years ago. I was at an unknown point in my life until someone asked me about my childhood in exactly the same way. What I hadn’t realised back then was that it’s in childhood where the foundation for your future is laid. As a child, you play in ways that suit you. You act in line with your nature, without outside pressure. You aren’t constrained by obligations. Through play, you discover what you like and what you don’t. But this process gets interrupted when we reach our teenage years, when we start having to make choices about our future. What education to pursue, what career to follow, what company to go work for. These decisions are often based on just one or a few options presented to us. Before we know it, we find ourselves boxed in, living a life that forgets who we once were and what we dreamed about.”

Julia listens and watches attentively to the lady. Only now does Julia notice the wrinkles on the lady's forehead and around her eyes. An old, wise lady, Julia thinks. A wise and beautiful old lady, in fact. The lady's teeth are white and radiant. Her eyes sparkle. Julia sees an immense joy of life in the lady's face.

“But, my dear,” says the lady, “I must take the children back to their mother. And tell me, how young are you, actually?”  

“I’m 45, ma’am,” Julia replies.  

“A beautiful flower in full bloom,” says the lady with a sigh. 

With these words, the lady stands up from the wooden bench. She extends her right hand to Julia. Julia extends her right hand, and they shake hands. The lady places her left hand on their clasped hands and says slowly, “Listen carefully, my dear, but listen only to yourself. Not to others. Only to yourself.” 

After these words, the lady turns and slowly walks toward the playing twins beneath the large chestnut tree.  

“Goodbye,” the lady calls to Julia, nodding one last time with a friendly smile.  

Julia continues to watch the lady. Each hand holds a child. Julia hears the lady singing, and the children sing along with her. Slowly, they disappear from view.  

On her way home, with fresh spinach, apples, and eggs in her bike bag, Julia’s thoughts are far away. Her mind lingers on the conversation with the lady on the bench and her own childhood.  

The conversation with the lady occupies Julia’s mind all weekend. Julia then realises that she never even asked the lady’s name. But the lady never asked Julia either.  

The week at work unfolds differently than usual. For the first time in a long while, Julia is not on autopilot. With every task, she asks herself what’s enjoyable about it and whether what she’s doing even matters. Yet, she feels nothing.  

In the evenings, in her cozy little house, Julia spends a lot of time online. She looks at small plots of land for sale, preferably with a little house and a barn. After nearly twenty-five years of working at the accounting firm and living frugally, Julia has built up a nice little savings. Not nearly enough to buy a large plot of land, but it’s a start. And who knows what her single-person home might bring in? Her mortgage is nearly paid off. 

On weekends, Julia heads out in her blue Ka to visit the locations she’s found online. Some are far from her office, but she doesn’t mind. If Julia’s plans succeed, she might not even need to go to work anymore. She catches herself dreaming, and sometimes she feels a wave of excitement when she sees a promising plot of land with a small house and barn.  

After three months of searching and consulting with a few real estate agents and her boss, Julia finds a plot of land an hour’s drive from her work. It’s in the middle of nature. The more than thirty fruit trees at the back of the large plot are the deciding factor. The little house is old but in good condition. It’s big enough for her alone. She’s going to have a lot more space than she has now. 

Behind the house, there’s a large barn—big enough for twenty cows. But she doesn’t want farm animals. Julia has other ideas.

Friends and family warn Julia about the risks of buying land and an old house. What if she gets sick and the expenses become too high? And what about maintenance? She doesn’t have to deal with that in her current home. No matter how well-intentioned their advice is, Julia makes up her mind.  

Julia spends Christmas that year in her own little country “castle” with the many fruit trees in her backyard.  

Winter finds Julia preparing diligently. She reads a lot about gardening. Julia plans to grow various vegetables in the spring. In the garden next to the barn, she’s going to plant vegetable seedlings directly into the soil. She’s just going to try—beans, tomatoes, peppers, zucchini, pumpkins—you name it. 

Every evening after work, Julia is busy in the garden: hoeing, pulling weeds, checking plants for any diseases. Even though it has become a duty, she enjoys working in the garden every evening. It’s as if she’s come alive for the first time. That’s how Julia describes it. She enjoys every moment. The TV is only on briefly while she’s eating, but for the rest of the evening, the tv’s off, and Julia is outside.

\-

“Hi, I’m Sanne,” says a voice.

Julia jumps and turns around so quickly that she almost loses her balance and falls over. A toddler, about seven years old, stands behind her between the bean poles, her thumb in her mouth.

“Hi,” says Julia. “I’m Julia.” She wants to extend her hand but then realises it’s covered in dirt.

“I think that’s a pretty name,” the toddler mumbles with her thumb locked between her tiny red lips. “Do you live here? I live there.” The little girl points across the road. 

The only house Julia sees is about 300 meters away. It’s the house she passes every day on her way to and from work.

“Did you come here all by yourself?” Julia asks quickly, a little nervous.

“Yoohoo!” comes a cheerful voice from behind a row of bean poles. A friendly woman’s face with wild blonde hair appears between the almost ripe runner beans.

“Sorry,” says the woman, looking apologetic. “She’s running so fast these days. She’s been begging to visit the new neighbour. She always sees you driving and cycling past. I’m Sarah.”

The woman with the blonde hair extends her hand. 

“I’m Julia, nice to meet you,” Julia says, looking at Sarah’s outstretched hand. “Sorry, my hands are pretty dirty.”

“Oh, no worries,” Sarah says. “We, my husband Peter and I, grow flowers. Mainly chrysanthemums, for export. To the U.S.”

“Ah, yes, of course,” Julia says. “I see the trucks coming and going all the time.”

“Are you going to grow your own vegetables?” Sarah asks.

“Yes, although it’s more of a test case,” Julia replies. “I’ve never done this before.”

“And all that fruit, soon?” Sarah asks. “The previous owners were too old and let the hanging fruit rot. We’d come by every now and then to pick up apples, pears, or cherries.”

“Well,” says Julia, “I’ve done a lot of reading, and I’m hoping to get help from some friends so that we can have a healthy harvest. I want to sell the fruit on its own and make jams and sauces.”

“I love playing shop,” the little girl Sanne interjects, looking up at Julia with her thumb still locked in her mouth.

“That’s going to be a lot of work,” says Sarah. “Just call me if you need help. I know some friends who have all day to help, now and then.”

“I can’t afford to pay anyone,” says Julia.

“Don’t worry, honey,” Sarah says. “When you see how much fruit you’ll get from those trees, you’ll be amazed. The girls will be happy with a few kilos here and there. No problem. That’s how we do it around here, in the country.”

That summer, Julia spends her days working in the air-conditioned office at the accounting firm, and her evenings until sundown in the garden. The amount of vegetables is so enormous that Julia eventually sets up a table by the road, where she places crates of that day’s harvest. The crates with fresh produce stay cool at the side of the road overnight, and she doesn’t have to carry them early in the morning. Passersby can take what they want and leave money in the crate. When Julia returns from work, almost everything is gone, and there’s always money in the box. 

On weekends, Sarah comes by to help in the garden. Sanne often stays behind with Julia until dinner. Sanne loves spending time in Julia’s garden. She especially enjoys cleaning and brushing off the carrots. Sometimes, a little dirt ends up on her dress, but that doesn’t matter. Sometimes a little dirt ends up on Sanne’s lips, and she sputters and splashes like a broken-outboard motor. They both laugh heartily every time this happens.  

That first beautiful summer ends with thousands of kilos of beautiful, healthy fruit—apples, pears, and cherries. Julia is fortunate to receive help every day from Sarah’s friends. She could never have harvested and sold all that fruit on her own. It’s far more than she ever dared to dream. In the barn, the girls built a sales counter from crates and planks. Customers can pick their own fruit and pay the ladies directly. 

Julia makes her first batch of “trial papple sauce” from a few crates of apples and pears. She jars it in small and large containers and sells it in the barn. The papple sauce turns out to be a success, and soon, every weekend, Julia is busy filling jars with freshly made papple sauce.

At the end of the season, she carefully takes stock. On the advice of her boss at work, Julia hadn’t accounted for any potential profit. Everything she did that year was seen as an investment. Revenues were not calculated. But when she sees a positive result of more than she expected, and she’s also given money to her friends as a thank-you for their help, Julia is pleasantly surprised. 

The earned money is invested in renovating the barn to make it look more like a little shop. The vegetable garden is expanded, and Julia plans to grow winter vegetables like Brussels sprouts, various types of cabbage, root vegetables, and winter carrots. A twenty-meter-long, six-meter-wide makeshift greenhouse is added next to the barn to grow other delights like strawberries. During the long, gray, and cold winter, she’ll figure out what else it’s going to become.  

That winter, she treats everyone who helped her make the garden a success that first summer to a night of good food and bowling in the village. Julia receives something in return from them at an unexpected moment. 

When she drives up to her yard, the lights of her Ka shine on the barn. Above the wide, tall wooden doors, there is a new large sign. It reads, “Julia’s Papple Sauce,” in rainbow colours. Next to the words ""papple sauce,"" there are drawings of little jars with bows around them. Julia sits in her small Ka for a moment, staring at the sign above the barn doors.

“My Papple Sauce,” she whispers.

The following year, the harvest and sales go very well. Once again, Julia gets help from her friends, but this time, they are paid hourly. Julia wants to see exactly how much profit can be made from growing vegetables and fruit. Sanne is also in the garden with Julia every day that year. At the end of the second season, the profits are so high that Julia decides to go part-time at the accounting firm to have more time for the garden. There’s enough left over to live on, but Julia doesn’t want to take the risk of quitting the accounting job completely. A year later, after the overwhelming success of the garden, Julia makes the final decision to quit her job in the city.

“Julia’s Papple Sauce” has grown into a successful business in just a few years, where most of the vegetables and fruit are grown without the use of chemicals. Customers come from surrounding villages, but many passersby also stop by when they see the vibrant colours of the fresh produce on display.

Many years go by with bountiful harvests and annual adjustments and expansions to Julia’s Papple Sauce. Julia has dedicated her heart to her unique garden, and nearly every square meter of and on the property is used for growing a variety of vegetables, herbs, and fruits. 

After years of playing shopkeeper, Sanne eventually becomes a grown woman. After graduating, she joins Julia full-time and takes charge of Julia’s Papple Sauce Inc. Sanne is also the one who helps Julia open branches in other villages and in the city, where the fresh delicacies from Julia’s Papple Sauce are sold. Sanne marries and has two healthy twin toddlers. They, of course, often go to the garden with Sanne when she visits the branches. 

Julia remains single all these years, and she has no problem with it. She feels happy and is grateful for the warm friendships she’s built in and around the garden with various people. Julia realises every day that she can and is allowed to do what she enjoys. Every morning, she walks down the path to the garden, singing, and starts her hobby—digging happily in the soil.

Julia never forgot the wise old lady on the wooden bench. The old lady opened her eyes. Without her, “Julia’s Papple Sauce” wouldn’t have existed.

One sunny Saturday morning in May, Julia decides to finally make a gesture of thanks to the old wise lady, more than 30 years later. That morning, Sanne is in the garden working with a few interns from the local horticultural school. 

“I’m going to the city for a bit,” Julia calls out to Sanne. “I’ll take the children with me so you can have some peace and quiet.”

“Okay,” Sanne replies. “Bring something nice for us. A red velvet cake, okay?”

The small Ka of the past has been replaced by a larger, electric four wheel drive truck. Julia often takes the two girls on trips, so she has two child seats in the back of the car. 

After an hour’s drive, Julia parks the car in the city garage where she used to park her Ka when she went to work 28 years ago. She walks with the children to the square in front of the organic store, where the even bigger chestnut tree still stands.

“Alright,” Julia says in a cheerful grandmotherly tone to the twins. “It’s safe between the tree’s toes, and you can play with the sand there.”

Julia lets the twins happily play in the sand under the chestnut tree. She looks around, trying to remember which bench she used to sit on. They’re not the same benches anymore, but they’re still in the same places. At least, it was a bench where we could see the children. As Julia thinks this, she realises that the old wise lady also had twins with her. “Grandma, yes, something like that,” the lady had said back then.

Julia sits down on a bench a few meters away from the twins. The air is warm, the sounds of laughter filling the space around the chestnut tree where the children are playing. Across from her, the organic store buzzes with activity. People come and go, cradling paper bags of fresh produce, some carrying trays with tea or coffee, sometimes with slices of apple cake that they take to the benches, enjoying the late morning sun.

Julia stares blankly ahead, her mind drifting back to the old wise lady.

 

“I really want to thank her for her advice” she thinks, almost out loud, but then a faint ache settles in her chest. The lady’s probably long gone. Who knows, maybe she wasn’t even from her, maybe she just passed through.  

Her thoughts swirl again, suddenly heavy. “Without her, I never would have made that decision. I wouldn’t even have known that I wasn’t happy.” The weight of those realisations pulls at her, the truth of it sinking deep into her. 

The reflection in the glass door of the organic store catches her attention, pulling her back to the present. She blinks, and for a second, it feels as though time stops.

The glass door reflects the bench. It reflects her too. Julia’s heart skips a beat. For the briefest moment, it’s as if she sees someone else sitting there. A woman—someone familiar, yet distant. Her brow furrows as she squints, unsure at first of what she’s seeing. She leans forward slightly, studying her own image, trying to make sense of it.

Then it hits her. A shiver runs up her spine, starting at the nape of her neck and flowing all the way down her arms to her ankles. Goosebumps rise along her skin, each tiny bump a spark of realisation. Her heart suddenly accelerates, thumping in her chest like a drum. Her breath catches, and she can feel her pulse in her throat, quick and unsteady.

""No... What?"" she whispers, more to herself than anyone around her.

It’s the reflection of “her”—but it’s not just “her” in that moment. It’s the old lady. The same woman who had sat on the bench all those years ago, who had given her the advice that changed everything. 

“Was that me?”

The thought feels almost too big to grasp, yet somehow so obvious at the same time. For several long moments, Julia just sits frozen, staring at her own reflection in the glass door. The image of the woman in the reflection is blurry, but it’s undeniable—she sees herself, but she also sees that moment from thirty years ago, as though she’s the one who gave herself the advice, the one who walked away from that conversation and changed her life.

The twins continue to laugh, their voices sweet and carefree, the sound of their joy a soft undercurrent to the revelation unfolding in Julia’s mind. She watches them, their little bodies darting between the roots of the chestnut tree, oblivious to the profound shift that has just occurred in Julia.

And then, just like that, the glass door opens. The moment breaks. The reflection of Julia in the door disappears, swallowed up by the movement. A young woman steps out of the store, holding a tray with a glass of tea and a slice of apple cake. She pauses, looking around briefly before her gaze lands on Julia. Her steps are light as she walks toward the bench.

“Good morning, madam,” the young lady says brightly. “Would it be okay if I sit here on the bench?”

Julia blinks, still stunned by the vision she just experienced. It takes a moment for the words to form, as though she’s being pulled out of a dream. Her mind is slow to catch up with reality.

“Of course, miss,” Julia replies finally, a friendly smile pulling at her lips, though it’s more automatic than anything. Her teeth catch the sunlight briefly, and she shifts her coat slightly to make room for the young woman.

But inside, Julia is still caught in that moment. The realisation lingers, humming beneath her skin, like a secret she didn’t know she was keeping.

The End

1ibc9ls,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ibc9ls/adhd_or_anxiety/,ADHD or Anxiety?,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out to this community because I’m feeling uncertain about my diagnosis and would appreciate your insights. My psychiatrist diagnosed me with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but I often wonder if my experiences might align more with ADHD. Here’s a breakdown of my symptoms and struggles:

1. Difficulty with consistency:
I made ambitious plans this semester—working on my thesis, studying for board exams, completing a physical education course (90 min/week gym requirement), etc. But I failed to accomplish any of them. I also couldn’t complete the syllabus for my two university exams and didn’t even attend them. I feel like I’ve wasted the semester.


2. Slow study pace:
I study much slower than my peers, and not starting early enough triggered crippling anxiety attacks. Even clonazepam didn’t help, and I missed my exams.


3. Poor time management:
I tried cooking twice daily to save money, but this left me no time for consistent studying.


4. Time blindness:
I constantly underestimate how long tasks will take. This has been a recurring pattern throughout university.


5. Study distractions:
When I try to study, I can focus initially, but anxious thoughts about potential failures take over, derailing my progress.


6. Childhood trauma:
When studying, intrusive thoughts about past trauma surface. I often need company to drown these out, which affects my coursework.


7. Dependency on stimulants:
I rely on coffee to focus, but strong caffeine (like energy drinks) worsens my anxiety, causing physical symptoms like chest pain, sweating, and difficulty breathing.


8. Dependency on others:
I feel extremely anxious when alone. I stay on video calls with my LDR boyfriend all day, but I also have recurring fears of betrayal, leading to fights.


9. Coping with avoidance:
On busy days, I find it hard to get out of bed. I end up scrolling for hours, avoiding the anxiety of facing my responsibilities.



My psychiatrist believes my thoughts are more organized than what he’s seen in ADHD patients, leading him to diagnose me with GAD. Currently, I’m on Sertraline (100 mg, recently increased from 50 mg) and Clonazepam (0.5 mg twice daily). Despite this, I’ve had severe panic attacks and episodes of endless crying over the last few days, which led to me missing my exams.

I’ve now decided to focus on my mental health and take it slow. My plan is to prioritize university subjects and start preparing notes early for the next exam period.

Another layer to this: I have severe flight anxiety, and I’m traveling in 4 days to visit my family. I lied to my parents (typical South Asian ones) about passing my exams to avoid further stress.

I’ll be meeting my psychiatrist again on February 13. In the meantime, I’d love to hear your thoughts:

Do my symptoms resonate with your experience of ADHD?

Could this all be explained by anxiety alone?

I have evidence supporting that I have only received one refund. They are threatening court. What are my options? (england)","For a full breakdown:

I ordered a coffee table with the value of £274.92 on the 15th October 2024.

The coffee table was out of stock and they kept pushing back the delivery date, so I requested a refund. 

October 24: The order was cancelled. I set up a payment dispute with my bank, Halifax, to get my money back as I hadn't received a refund. Halifax gave me £274.92 temporarily, until the matter was sorted.

October 25: The company provides me with a refund of £274.92.

At this point, yes, I have 2 refunds.

November 19: I receive a text from Halifax explaining how the company refunded me, and they would be taking £274 from me to give back to the company in 10 days.

November 29: Halifax takes £274.92 from my bank account and returns it to the company as the dispute was resolved. 

I have, in total, received ONE refund. I have bank statements proving all of the above. I have sent this to the company who are not listening and are adamant they are correct. But I too am adamant I'm correct. They have threatened me with small claims court - but I don't want to pay a company £274 when I know I haven't received 2 refunds.

Should I let them take me to court? What are my
options? Should I go to Halifax to collect more evidence?

This morning I broke fast and had a dry slice of wheat toast and a slice of bacon with the meds and the experience was much better. I know bacon and toast isn't ideal but I need something on my stomach to take this medicine. 

Alternative ideas for my situation? Light snack (suggestions please) in the morning with medicine? Take meds at 1200 and 1800? Anyone with experience have some advice?

So a few days ago I picked up the glossier balms dotcom as a little treat, I got the mango one and I LOVE IT. the texture is great and it's quite moisturizing. 

However, almost every time I use it, the line that separates my bottom lip from the rest of my skin gets itchy/irritated? But only that spot on my bottom lip, not on the top and there's no visible redness or any splotchy areas. Even my lips themselves where I apply the product don't feel irritated, just below the lips.

 I used to have treenut allergies but recently tested negative for all of them, I checked the ingredients and nothing stood out to me that I'd be allergic to it. I can use Shea butter, coconut oil, beeswax, lanolin, standard stuff. 

This did happen previously with the Summer Fridays balm (iced coffee), but it was a lot more intense to the point that I couldn't wear it and had to return it. My question is, am I genuinely allergic to the glossier balm, or it is possible that my anxiety is creating a false reaction because it's happened before with the Summer Fridays one? I know it sounds confusing but I have very bad anxiety (possibly OCD) and it can cause a lot of physical symptoms if I think I might be sick/allergic (ex. I'll start to get a scratchy throat if someone around me has a cold and I think I caught it)

..._<sits down>_...

I'm happy for my mood today, because this is a good mood to have. Excited about the day. Excited and motivated for the week ..._<raises mug>_... Happy New Week to you, kid!

So, yeah, that feels nice.

Now... Of course it also happens we have a less than stellar mood, for whatever reason. And... Have you notice we sometimes say that to someone? ""You're in a mood today!""

..._<nods>_... Sometimes we're _in_ a mood and we don't even know it. Everything is just shitty. The weather is shitty. People are annoying. Life is. 

The funny thing is of course that our moods can color the world. What is endearing in a good mood is highly annoying in a not so good mood. What is a minor setback when you feel up, feels like the end of the world when we feel down. Affective realism, they call it; how we feel affects what we see.

..._<thinks>_... Think of it as color blindness. That some days you see colors ""as they are"", other days you are affected by one form of color blindness or another. It changes how you see and experience the world, right? ..._<nods>_... Our moods, our feelings, do the same thing.

Now, sticking with that color blindness example, wouldn't it be helpful, maybe even really important, for us to be _aware_ the colors we see can change every day based on what kind of color blindness we have that day, if any? ..._<nods>_... It would, right? Otherwise you might wear the wrong color combination, get the wrong paint for you house, the whole nine yards.

The _same_ is true for our moods and feelings. If we're not aware we're ""in a mood"", we may not stay fully aware it colors how we experience ourselves and the world around us.

By being aware of our mood, we're no longer ""in"" our mood without knowing it; we're _having_ a mood and are fully aware of it.

..._<shakes head>_... Don't even have to do anything else at that point. Don't need to try to change the mood or anything. That perspective switch in experience, that awareness, _is_ the change.

..._<smiles>_... Come, we should get started with our day.

She was cold, as cold as she had ever been. She was in the chair, gaze fixed on the hearth, the last red embers reminiscent of a city that had been razed.

She tested her fingers. They moved on the arms of the chair but prickled with sleep. She needed to get up, find her bearings, and get the hell out of here. Whatever game Knutson, John Taylor, and that strange woman, Sister Jillian were playing would be dealt with swiftly and severely.

Was Taylor a traitor? Had he been turned by FEEN?

The coffee and cookies the man claiming to be Alexi had given her were probably laced with a slow-acting drug. It would be convenient for her enemies if she were to perish in an unmarked building deep inside the contamination zone.

She tried to push herself up, but there was no strength in her arms or legs. The sensation of needles prickling her body was maddening. Even if she wanted to call out for help and expose her position, she couldn’t. Her mouth was dry, her throat gunked up, unable to take a deep enough breath to hawk it up while the drug was still circulating in her system.

Time. She needed a little more time.

She listened intently for the slightest noise as she pieced together the events of the last twenty-four hours, examining them for clues to the plot. Deciphering its mechanisms would be the key to her survival.

John Taylor had visited her at her campaign headquarters in New York City to congratulate her. There, he reiterated that he did not want a cabinet position. He wanted something else, and it was all linked to that woman. Allgood had accepted this, for it was the billionaire and powerful senator who selected her as the SP candidate and guided her to victory. Their political destinies were linked. One did not simply rise to the most powerful office in the world without the attachment of strings. Numerous were the stakeholders who had been promised a thread or two of her position in return for their money and influence. If this was a conspiracy orchestrated by Taylor—her campaign advisor, her former commander who had saved her life on the battlefield, her friend—it was idiotic. Unless there was something she wasn’t seeing.

The most obvious culprit was the man who would immediately benefit from her demise, Vice President-elect Dana Martz. She’d never liked the man, never trusted him. Under heavy pressure from the Speaker of the House, she had chosen the heir to a garbage reclamation and recycling empire as her VP because he protected two vulnerabilities in her right-wing body armor. He was a token to the old guard Republicans who ruled the Floridian panhandle and islets, and he was a top lieutenant in the Pastor Tony’s Boys organization.

The image of the bearded, steroid-bloated pastor flashed across her mind. The man had given her the votes of his congregation but had condemned her as a necessary evil in God’s long game. After all these years, God still didn’t like dykes.

She laughed, and a wave of searing needles swarmed across her body. Her mind ached to take a deep breath, but her diaphragm refused to respond. She focused on a succession of short, fractional breaths until she had enough air, and then she slowly let it out.

After Taylor left her headquarters, she accepted two congratulatory phone calls. The first was from the president of Canada, which she managed in her passable Québécois. The other, an obligatory call, was from Pastor Tony himself. “Congratulations, Jane,” he had said in his deep, breathy baritone. “He sets up kingdoms, and He tears them down.” And then, before she could say a word, he started to pray. “May the God of Abraham and Isaac fashion this wretched sinner into His divine tool. May He guide her hand as He guided the stone of David and the sword of Gideon. Amen.” She said nothing. “I said Amen.” She said nothing. The line went dead.

It was midnight when she quit her office for the apartment three floors higher. The private elevator opened into the living room. Christy lounged in an oversized t-shirt on the sofa, staring through her AR glasses, now and then lifting a hand or flicking a finger as she manipulated something on her social media accounts. The large television played a drone feed of the protest fires.

Over the months leading up to the election, as the death threats started to roll in and her freedoms became limited, Christy had begun to study the protesters. She learned their aliases and read their social media. She followed their movements and their tactics. It grew into an obsession that worried Allgood, but this was their new reality, and they both had to deal with it in their own ways.

“You’re back.” She removed her glasses and set them on the coffee table. She stood, her shirt coming off one slim shoulder. “Mrs. President.” She bit her bottom lip in that sexy way and came toward her.

Allgood took the hem of her shirt and pulled it up her shapely thigh. She was nude underneath. Smooth and fresh.

She filled her hands with her soft, luxurious hair, golden blonde. It smelled like roses. She ran her fingers through it, pulled her head back, and kissed her with a savage passion.

“Jesus,” Christy said when she finally let up.

“Not you, too.”

“What?”

“Pastor Tony called to bless me.”

“Christ—Sorry—Fuck—I hate that guy.”

Allgood palmed a full breast. “I need you, baby.”

Christy pushed her down onto the sofa and straddled her lap, her shirt falling to the floor. She was glorious when naked. She buried her head in her breasts, and suckled on her nipples until she exclaimed her lust.

They made noisy love in the firelight of the drone video.

The call came at 4:30 AM. She dressed in a jogging suit, descended in the golden elevator with its eternal music, and at the front entrance, under the watchful eyes of a dozen Secret Service agents, entered the black SUV that would take her to Taylor’s private jet.

A woman in a black bodysuit with short, sharp hair sat across from her.

“I am Sister Jillian,” she said.

“I’ve seen you around,” said Allgood. “You and your crew are kind of hard to miss.”

“Do you understand the significance of what is happening?” asked Sister Jillian.

“John Taylor explained. If I did not trust the man with my life, I wouldn’t be here.”

“The ceremony will take place tomorrow night, local time. You will meet your predecessor in the anointed room. There will be a chair, a fire, and a door. Do you understand?”

“Simple enough.”

“No. There is nothing simple about this. Do you understand?”

“Yes. I understand. What is the ceremony?”

“I cannot say. That is a mystery that will unfold. You will see, you will say, and you will do. You must follow it through.”

“And then?” asked Allgood.

“Clarity,” said Sister Jillian.

“So, you’re some sort of cult?” When the woman didn’t respond, she added, “You know, like the Gretas? Or is it more like Pastor Tony?”

Nothing more was said until they reached the airport, where a JTS jet waited with silver stairs leading up to the fuselage.

“One last thing, Jane,” said Sister Jillian.

“Mrs. President-elect,” corrected Allgood. On the tarmac in the cold morning air, she was annoyed. She needed coffee.

Sister Jillian gave a slight smile. “Do not lose yourself. I cannot protect you if you do.”

The cold darkness of the room. The fire barely visible under a pile of ash. Far beyond the walls, a wail lifted, then changed to a howl, and then another. It was a series of calls and returns, not of wolves but of some other more sinister creature. Then, as suddenly as they had risen, they stopped.

The needle pricks in her flesh faded to a dull heat as the numbing agent wore off and blood flowed into her muscles. She could feel her toes in her boots, and she was able to flex her legs and buttocks.

Beyond the closed door adjacent to the fireplace, she heard a dry scuff of movement. The fire’s last embers reflected a question mark on the brass doorknob. The question mark turned clockwise. The latch clicked. Then… five seconds of stillness. The door opened, and a presence lingered at the perimeter of shadow.

She controlled her breath and heartbeat with a soldier’s discipline. Whoever, whatever it was, moved behind the chair. Helpless, she waited for it: gunshot to the head, knife to the throat—whatever may come.

“Come,” spoke a soft voice.

She did not respond.

“Come,” said the voice again, a female voice.

“I can’t move well. I think I’ve been poisoned.”

This time, when the howls went up, they were much closer. Down that dark hallway on the street in front of the Stalin Building. The presence moved next to her. A hand went under her arm, and a face eclipsed the fire. Warm, moist breath against her skin. Lips touched her lips. The wetness of a kiss.

Instantly, the needles vanished. She could move. Her joints, sore from her years at war, felt steeped in warmth like soothing water from a natural hot spring, like the flush of muscle after a good workout.

The figure in the darkness pulled up on her sleeve again, and she rose, stretching and trying her limbs. She was in full control of her faculties. She could fight. By sense of closeness, she knew she was taller than this shadow that had kissed her. She could break its neck. She could do it now.

“Hold still,” said the voice. It was a girl.

A delicate sharpness tickled down her side, then down her back and down her legs. Each arm. Now down her front between her breasts, slicing her clothes from her body. The freezing air on her bare shoulders as her garments fell away sent goosebumps across her flesh.

“Take your shoes off,” said the girl.

“My shoes?”

“And your underwear.”

“I don’t—”

“Naked we come. Naked we go.”

The crash of splintering wood from the front vibrated through the building.

“Fast,” hissed the girl.

Allgood kicked off her boots and slipped out of her panties.

She was grabbed and pulled to the door. At the threshold of it, there was a darkness denser than anything she’d ever known. The howl came from the hallway. The rush!

“Now or never!” shouted the girl, and she was gone into the dark.

Currently I carry:

- 2-10 days worth of cured fish. I only eat before I sleep so each piece accounts for a little over 1 day of food. Cured fish also has the best cal/kg ratio, has no smell, and decays slow so it’s ideal for traveling and long expeditions away from bases.

- 1 coffee and herbal tea already prepared. 2 extra coffee tins and 2 tea boxes that can be prepared on demand. The boxes and tins are very low weight so you could honestly carry way more.

- 4 pieces of pemmican. This gives some of the best effects in the game and can be used in conjunction with coffee as a sort of “backup” emergency stim. Not too heavy so well worth the weight even if you don’t end up using them. It seems to me other recipes don’t compare to pemmican in terms of cost to produce, positive benefits and negative benefits.

That’s it for now but wondering if anyone carry’s anything additional/different. My only requirement is that nothing I carry should give off scent and attract predators.",1,1737992186.0,thelongdark,1,1.0,False

1ibbtt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1ibbtt2/need_to_vent/,Need to vent,"I think that once I will post this, I will feel much better. I feel I am the most horrible person in the world and I hate myself, I don't even know if this is limerence or true love but I don't want to ruin my life.

I've been married for 20 + years. I've always been happy with my husband. Never had a crush after we married and life was just perfect and peaceful.

8 years ago I switched jobs and met a lot of new people, obviously. There is this guy, a bit younger than me (5 years) that, for some reason I can't comprehend, chose me to be his work bestie. We've been inseparable since. We eat lunch together, have coffee breaks together, confide in each other but on the other hand, we've never met outside of the office. He is single. And he is really attractive. And an amazing person.

I have feelings for him since 2022. I thought it was limerence so I didn't feel that bad because I thought it would go away like any other silly crush. It felt like limerence but our relationship is so so different from my previous limerence experiences, when the guys barely knew I existed. I am close to this person, we are very good friends and I do love him (as a friend I mean). He's been there for me in my worst moments and he is always near me, defending me when there is conflict and supporting me even when I don't need support. It's like he is always one step ahead and knows exactly what I need. 

The thing is that the ""situationship"" is escalating. He drove me home 2 months ago. It was the first time we hang out after work and outside a working environment. Then he started having little gestures: he brought me chocolate, another day he cooked lunch for me and make a picnic for 2 in the office (not a real picnic, just a separate table but he brought food), he makes me coffee every morning at 9:30, etc... I feel this is moving towards something, but what if it's the limerence clouding my judgement? What if he is just a really good friend and I'm seeing things that are not real at all?

Everybody in the office gossips about us. Many people asks us if we are a couple. I have other friends that tell me I should start putting some distance if I don't want to ruin my marriage but the thing is, I'm pretty sure he is not corresponding my feelings. He's never made a comment or said anything about it. 

What worries me is, are these true feelings? Did I really fall for this guy and is not limerence? Because if it is not limerence, this changes the whole thing!! It means I will have to talk to my husband at some point. 

  
I don't know what I expect from your answers, feel free to give your opinions. I can't possibly feel worse than I already feel, so go ahead. ",3,1737991956.0,limerence,2,1.0,False
1ibbszi,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ibbszi/my_name_is_gr3gory/,My Name is Gr3gory,"My whole life, I've been... unlucky. Whether it was having a broken limb every summer, getting sick every flu season, never getting good grades, or even just my hair looking dumb, styled both long *or* short, it was as though I was a magnet for misfortune. 


Very much unlike my twin brother Jeremy. He was the *best* at *everything*. He always had friends, always got the girl, the good grades, prom king, you name it, he had it. 


Even now, as we both were taking college classes, I was struggling; changing my major frequently, while Jeremy was flex coursing his way through med school. 26, finishing six years of credits in only three, and somehow had still made time for life outside of school, to spend with our mom, and his fiance. 


I still lived at home, so I saw mom daily. Honestly she wasn't too interesting. She had maybe 5 things she'd say on repeat, and that was it: ""You planning on getting out of bed today?"" ""Did you put any job applications in this weeks?"" ""Are you planning on cleaning your room, so I can finally do all the dishes?"" ""You need to figure out a financial plan, like your brother"" ""Are you planning on moving out soon?"" 


But when my brother came over, she swooned over him. Congratulating him on his most recently published medical article, or complimenting his fiance on her new necklace or earrings. She always had nice things to say to him: how proud she is, and how good he looked. How she never doubted he would become a dignified member of society. 


And you might think that, yes, I, Gregory, have a pretty lame life. Whether it be my own poor choices, or what the universe laid out in front of me. I suck. And I must be very depressed. 


And I would be...


Except I just got a letter. 


And I've been waiting until our family dinner, to share it with my mom and Jeremy. 


I wore my best button up shirt and my least wrinkled pants. I even tried combing out my hair. I could hear Jeremy and his fiance, Shelby walk in and trade greetings with our mom. 


I came down, almost giddy to help prepare the meal, which surprised my brother. Usually I snuck in, last minute, to eat and then go do my own thing. Throughout the next hour, they all eyed me curiously, until the moment finally came. 


In the middle of our meal, I stood up and announced, ""Guys, I'm moving out!"" 


They stared at me, a mixture of confusion and excitement. Jeremy, being an optimist, was the first to say, ""Hey, Greg, that's great! You found an apartment?""


""Nope"" I said still cheerful.


""A home? That's a pretty big commitment"" my mom chimed in, ""are you buying or renting?"" 


""Not that either"" my smile couldn't get any bigger.


Everyone was quiet, so I continued, ""I found our grandfather."" 


My mom gasped and immediately started choking on her wine. 


""Grandfather? We don't have a grandfather"" Jeremy said. 


""Well, that's what *mom* wanted us to think."" I said as I held up my letter, ""I just got this in the mail. It's from an attorney who was just assigned to Ham Spiegel, *our grandfather*. He had a will written long ago, that stated, in the unlikely event that he become ill, to the point of needing living assistance, *I* can get soul inheritance of his house, land, ALL OF IT, if I just go take care of him!"" 


""Long ago, but it included you, specifically?"" Jeremy swiped the letter from me. 


""You can't possibly,"" mom was still coughing, ""be considering going out to his property"" 


""Uh. Yeah I am! It's a sweet deal!"" I started getting a little upset. Why weren't my brother and mom as happy as I was? 


""Yup it says here: Gregory, and only he, has this opportunity"" Jeremy read.


Mom persisted, ""Greg please don't go out there. You don't even know him""


""Well who's fault is that?!""


""He isn't like other men. Not like other grandfather's. He was a terrible father, and I don't want you going near him."" 


I chuckled, ""What's he going to do? It says here, he's needing living assistance. He could be in a coma! I could literally just be changing shit bags, and saline drips. And in exchange, I get my own place! I thought you'd be happy to have me out of your house."" I grabbed my letter back from Jeremy and headed up to my room. 


Mom caught up to me, holding my arm, ""Gregory I'm begging you to please not go. There will be other opportunities. This isn't your only shot."" 


I stared at her for a moment, and smiled. She actually cared about me. She was actually begging me to stay. She was actually showing some interest in my decisions. 


But it didn't matter. I had made up my mind a week ago. I had spent the last few days packing my stuff. Surprisingly, there's not a lot of it. I only needed two suitcases. 


I stepped away from my mother, walked around the corner, grab those two suitcases, said one last goodbye and walked out the door. 



I thought back to those last few moments, as I sat in the train station. I also thought about what opportunities lie ahead of me, as I make a very unexpected turn in my life: meeting a man I never knew, seeing sites I've never seen...


An announcement rang out, and I got up to catch the train that would take me closest to the little town of Deepwater, Missouri. 


§


I had a few different ideas of what to expect, as the cab dropped me at the front of my grandfather's property, but the amount of trees and overgrown shrubs was rather surprising. The driveway was about a quarter mile long, and the whole walk down, there was no gaps between the twigs and foliage. 

About 60 yards from the house, the trees started clearing up to show an empty yard with a large brick patio. Of course it didn't look very empty, with how long the grass was. The patio needed maintenance, also: bricks were broken, chairs were rotten, and hanging plants had been dead for some time. 

How long had Grandpa been sick? And did he not have anyone else, out here, that could maintain the property? 

Well, I guess that's why I was notified. I wonder if the inside of the house looked any better. 

I walked up to the front door and froze. Do I knock? Do I just go in? Until now, this all felt like a dream, but as soon as I touch this door, I know reality will fall over me, like a heavy blanket.

As I reached for the knob, the door opened. I jumped back a little as I saw a man, who could not be my grandpa. He was maybe 35, in a navy blue suit. He carried a briefcase that I'm sure held all his emotions, since on his face he wore the most shallow smile I'd ever seen. This was the attorney. 

""Hi, you must be Gregory! My name's David."" He said, his smile widening, as he put out a very stiff hand for me to shake. 

After I reciprocated, he gestured for me to follow him into the house. 

Most all the lights were off, but with the sun shining through the windows, I could see how... stagnant the house looked. All objects were discolored from the amount of dust coating them. I feared touching anything, as it may result in a mobile dust cloud. 

David lead me to a study where we could sit and discuss my grandfather. 

""Alright,"" he said opening his briefcase, ""first off, thank you for being here on time. I'm used to these types of meetings, and sometimes I have to stay for a few days for a loved one to show up. Which is usually fine, but being out here in the thicket just gives me the heebie-jeebies. I guess that's just the city-boy in me."" 

He chuckled, but cleared his throat and changed the conversation, ""So anyway, I do apologize, I am pretty new to Ham's file. This thing had more dust on it than this house does! He made it about 25 years ago, and has never updated it."" He started turning pages, ""Well, I mean, he did everything to keep it relevant, but the one thing that always stayed the same was you. That you get everything, if you just come take care of Ham during his final time here on Earth."" 

He looked at me, expecting some sort of emotion. Or maybe any questions. But I just sat there quietly. He turned a few more pages, ""Okie doke, well that's about everything that relates to you, in this file, so if you could just sign here, stating you were informed, I can get out of your hair."" 

I signed all his forms, and asked, ""So... where's my grandfather now?"" 

David collected his papers and stood up, ""Oh, I do suppose that's something we haven't discussed. So now that these are signed,"" he held up his brief case, ""I can call the retirement and rehab facility in town, and a hospice nurse will get Ham scheduled to be moved back out here."" 

""How soon would that take?

He strolled to the front door, ""To get him back out here? Well it's a Thursday, so he could be back in the house tomorrow. Lucky it's not a weekend. Nobody would come out here on the weekend."" 

""Do you happen to know what his... condition is?"" 

David now stood on the porch. His eyes squinted, like he was remembering, ""I'm sure the nurse could tell you better, when they drop him off, but from what I heard, it was a stroke."" 

That scared me a little. I wasn't sure I knew how to take care of a stroke recovery patient. I guess I'll be talking with that hospice nurse quite a bit. 

I was so lost in thought that I barely heard David as he walked down the steps, ""I'm surprised he survived actually, at his age. Most 98-years-olds couldn't come back from something like that."" 

That made me chuckle. Must have been where my brother Jeremy got his genetics. My twin brother never got sick. He's even fallen from great heights and never broke a bone. Meanwhile I can't even eat eggs without going into anaphylactic shock. 

""You must really be special"" David said. Again, jolting me from my thoughts. Have they been thoughts? Had I been talking out loud? 

"" Huh?"" I said, caught off guard.

""Don't be offended, but I read through Ham's family records. He has two daughters, another grandson, and many in-laws that live out of state. He could have left his property to anyone. Or to all of y'all to fight over. But he chose you. You two must have a special bond."" 

With that, David finally turned and walked down the driveway. I saw him take out his cellphone, most likely to call a cab, or maybe the retirement home. 

That meant I had the rest of today to explore this property, and see if this house was even worth keeping after grandpa died. 

But first, I was hungry. I went back into the house and quickly found the kitchen. Most everything in the fridge was rotten or expired, and the pantry had mice. Well that would be first on my to-do list in this house, I decided. 

I filled a trash bag with old fruits, vegetables, and every box in the pantry that had a hole chewed in it. As I walked the bag out the side door, something caught my eye. 

It was my name. My name on a sticky note attached to a key. A key that definitely went to a vehicle. The attorney didn't go over this at all. As I took the key off the hook, I noticed my name again, this time on an envelope, on the counter. I opened the envelope and pulled out a piece of paper. As I did, a credit card fell out. 

The paper simply said, ""Don't go too crazy"". 

I stood there in disbelief. How could this be real? So many things ran through my head but the one that stuck out the most was my brother. Jeremy had worked so hard for his first car. He got it when he was 15, and did weeks if not months of manual labor to get enough money for it. And how excited he was to get his first real paycheck. He used it to take Mom out to dinner. 

I suddenly remembered how hungry I was. I stuffed the credit card into my pocket and ran outside to see if I could find a vehicle that matched this key. 

Right out the side door was a two-door garage. It held three vehicles: A '73 Pontiac Catalina, the station wagon model, an '82 Buick Riviera, *GOSH* I begged for that to be mine, but I could tell, with as new as this key looked, it had to belong to the '95 Acura. 

My heart sank just a little, but it was still a car, and it was still mine. Time to cruise into town, and see what the local food was like. 

The town was cute. Very Hallmark. The streets were clean. Every store was open and inviting. Even the families seemed like they jumped right out of a Norman Rockwell painting. As I was stopped at a light, a husband and wife walked across, smiling and holding hands, with their twin girls skipping along, in front of them. They all wore matching coats. The girls had tight golden locks. 

Passed the family, I decided to stop as Marla's Diner. It was pretty crowded so I figured the food must be good. 

Inside, the diner was just as picturesque as the streets. Families, dressed their best, took up half the booths. The mailman stood at the bar, chatting up the local sheriff. And waitresses, sporting old-school diner attire, swarmed the facility accordingly.

I was suddenly aware that I probably stood out like a sore thumb. I was still in the same slacks and button-up shirt that I had worn to dinner, the night before. Who knew what the condition of my hair was. Even if it were all in my head, I could feel the eyes judging me, and I quickly dipped into a booth in the back corner. 

A waitress immediately came up to me, ""Hey there hon, can I get you anything to start with? Coffee? Orange juice? Something stronger?"" She gave me a humourous wink. 

I blushed, and asked for tea. She quickly went to retrieve my beverage. 

As I sat, I noticed many people taking glances at me. Did I really look that awful? I turned my face to the window and tried smashing my hair down into a presentable style. 

""Excuse me"" came a soft voice from behind me. 

I turned to see an older woman standing there. She was short, with your classic snow-white perm, with a little purple pill box cap on top. She had a matching purple pantsuit, and bamboo purse. Beyond her, I saw at least six booth occupants watching our interaction. 

""Y-yes ma'am?"" I was very unsure of what she would say. 

""You look pretty new to the town. You wouldn't happen to be dear Ham's grandson would you?"" 

Again I said, ""Yes ma'am."" 

Her eyes lit up, and without asking, took a seat next to me, leaving her husband in another booth. A few other women came and sat across from us. 

""Oh, it's so nice to meet you!"" She said, ""My name's Sheryl, and these,"" pointing to the other two women who joined *our* booth, ""are Jasmine and Rachel. We're big fans of your grandfather.""

""Oh he's such a wonderful man."" Jasmine stated, ""We were very sorry to hear about his stroke.""

""In fact all of us in the diner, sort of, idolize him,"" Rachel chimed in, ""he's just such a wonderful teacher."" 

""Oh...um that's great. What exactly does my grandfather teach.?"" 

The women all looked at each other. Sheryl responded, ""Oh, just about everything. He's just so knowledgeable. Almost like he's on a spiritual level."" The ladies all giggled. 

At that moment, the waitress came back with my tea, ""I see you made some friends. Did you have an idea of what you'd like to eat?"" 

I hadn't even had time to look at the menu, but I knew what I wanted. I'd been craving bacon for a while, ""Yeah, could I get a lumberjack breakfast, but instead of eggs, can I just get more strips of bacon?"" 

The women at my booth went silent, and kind of eyed each other, and then looked at the waitress. 

The waitress said, ""Well, we don't carry eggs here anyway, hon, so I'll get that order out as soon as I can."" She gave me another wink, and turned back to the kitchen. 

The women all sighed and went back to there little giggles. I took a moment, to open the menu and did notice there definitely wasn't any eggs available in any dishes. Not even as ingredients. No hollandaise sauce, and the pancakes and waffles were made with bananas as a substitute. I personally love breakfast food, and since I'm allergic to eggs, this might be my new favorite restaurant in town. 

""By the way, you never told us your name, son"" Sheryl said sweetly. 

I took at sip of my tea, their eyes staring at me, almost in admiration. ""Um. Gregory."" 

""Gregory"" they all said in unison. 

Sheryl then shouted to her husband, ""This is Gregory! He's Ham's grandson!"" 

Suddenly a few other folks in the diner came over to shake my hand and introduce themselves. One mom brought her twin boys over to meet me. 

Definitely having never been the center of attention, I had no idea how to act. I tried making small talk with the twin boys, saying how I was a twin too. They just giggled and ran back to their seats. 

""Alright, alright, y'all leave this young man alone so he can enjoy the best hash-browns he's ever tasted,"" my waitress was back. As she placed the meal in front of me, the crowd dispersed. 

The only one left was Sheryl. ""Well, I guess we'll see you around town then, and definitely up at the ch- at your grandfather's place. It was very nice to meet you."" She got up and went back to her husband's booth.

The hasbrowns were good. The bacon was better. I ate the last strip, as I wrote a shopping list on a napkin. 

The town's grocery store was only a few blocks from the diner. Considering my grandfather's condition, I decided to stock up on broths, smoothies, and other things that were easy to eat. Perhaps I'd even look for a food processor or blender. If there's one at the house, I'm sure it's outdated. 

Down one aisle, a short, older man stopped and talked with me. Apparently word travels very fast here. He thanked me for coming to town, and how sweet I was to be taking care of my grandfather. I just shrugged and said it wasn't a big deal. As the little man turned to walk away, his posture made me remember that I needed to stop down the handy-man aisle and get some mousetraps. 

What all did mice eat? I feel like I remember some movie where an old farm woman was ranting to her husband about rats breaking all her chickens eggs. She'd go to collect, and all the eggs would be broken and the contents drank out. 

I decided that was a good place to start. It wouldn't hurt to have eggs in the house as another easy food for grandpa, also. But after the second complete walk-through in the cold section, I could not find eggs *anywhere*. 

I stopped an employee, and asked about an egg section to which he replied, ""Sorry sir, we don't sell those.""

Well that's odd. 

For a restaurant not to sell eggs is one thing, but for them not to be at the grocery store is a whole other level. 

Being allergic, I probably cared less bout this than someone else would. I decided some cheese cubes would be better for mouse bait anyway, so I grabbed a pack, and checked out. 


§


With the kitchen fully cleaned, stocked, and baited for mice, I could now explore the rest of the house. 

I couldn't tell you the age of this house, but I could say that it's whatever year they were able to make houses that looked tiny on the outside, but quite comfortable and spacious on the inside. Aside from the study and the kitchen, there was a living area, a den with a fireplace, two bedrooms, and... what was this upstairs? 

The upstairs was just one whole room, complete with gables. Almost as though, originally it was the attic, but was walled and insulated some years later. The room was red. Stacked and leaning on one wall were maybe 30 folding chairs. And on the other side, there was a podium, with some fancy symbolic displays behind it. 

I thought back to the diner and what the women had said to me about my grandfather:

*""He's just such a wonderful teacher""*

*""Almost on a spiritual level""*

Was Ham Spiegel a pastor? Did he hold sermons out here? 

Our mom never pushed any type of religion on us. In fact I wasn't familiar with any types of religious traditions. But as I looked out the gable window, toward the beautiful lake, just past the trees, I felt tranquil. This setting, out here in the woods, near the water, would be a perfect little religious getaway. For a moment I was proud of my grandfather. 

Respectfully, I left the upstairs, so not to damage any relics or ruin any spiritual energy. Though I was definitely curious. I would absolutely be asking questions about the... chapel? I guess you could call the upstairs a chapel. 

But for now, just seeing the lake, through that upstairs window, made me want to go walking out back. 

I walked off the brick patio, taking mental notes of some things that needed fixing. I would definitely need to get some good chairs for out here. It's too good a space to not enjoy. 

This whole property was too good not to enjoy. To think, grandpa lived out here, all by himself, for all these years. I wonder if that was what made him so wise. Walking through these trees, I sure felt at peace with the world. Being out here, it wasn't hard to shut out the hustle and bustle, and focus on those inner thoughts. 

Somewhere between the house and the water front, I came across a small clearing in the trees. The area was... eerie. There were children's toys everywhere. On the ground were tonka trucks and baby dolls, and multiple swings were hung in trees on the edges of the clearing. There was a seesaw, and also a little toddler playhouse. 

What was this? Why was this on grandpa's property? I thought back to the attorney's comment. He said grandpa had two daughters, and one other grandson -that grandson, of course being Jeremy, my twin brother. And all other 'in-law' relatives lived out of state. So there was no other relatives that this could be for. 

Oh but wait. If he had sermons upstairs, then maybe this area was for the children of the members of Grandpa's little chapel. But this was pretty far into the trees from Grandpa's back patio. I guess folks around here have more trust in their kids, just to let them go walking into the woods, with no adult supervision. Aside from that, what else could this area be for?

Even if it was harmless, the little clearing gave me an uneasy feeling. I ran past it quick, and soon reached the water's edge. 

I would need to put a bench out here. The maps in town would tell you this was a creek, and if so, it's the biggest creek I've ever seen. The water stretched all the way across the horizon, to where the trees on the other side were blurry smudges. The surface was smooth as glass. 

A few hundred feet out, there were two men in a row-boat. They looked to be chumming the water. They had a few buckets, with large chunks of some type of meat that they dumped straight over the side. I wondered what kind of fish must be in these waters. I looked down and kicked a rock into a shallow area. 

As I looked back up, the two men in the boat were staring right at me. They didn't have any expression on their faces. Were they scared? Did they think I would tattle to the game warden about chumming the water? I definitely didn't care about any of that, so to show them I meant no threat, I smiled and waved. Both the men reciprocated, at least by waving. Their faces didn't appear to change. I might have been thinking about it a little too hard, but the guys made me a uncomfortable. 

Suddenly there was a splash at my feet. I jumped back and saw the rock, that I had kicked into the water, had been tossed back out. I felt like that scared me more than it should have. I was breathing heavily. The men in the boat were still staring at me. I let out a nervous chuckle, laughing at my own demeanor. Then I quickly walked back to the house, bypassing the children's play area. 

So maybe the attorney did have a reason to get the heebie-jeebies out here. But after I've cleaned up the property, and removed a few things, this place should be warm and inviting. 

By the time I got back to the house, the sun had set. I figured I should make some dinner and try to get some sleep. But as I walked passed the den, I noticed a light-source coming from within. I walked into the room cautiously, and saw that the light was coming from a slightly ajar door. I guess I didn't explore this room enough, to notice it before. 

I pulled the door open the rest of the way and saw stairs. I didn't think this place could get any bigger, and now it seems I've found a basement. 

Only the light at the top of the stairs was on. I carefully made my way down. Maybe there would be more chairs down here that I could set up on the back patio. But as my foot planted on the basement floor, and my hands found a light switch, I realized this was a different kind of storage. 

Wine. 

It lined every wall, from Ports and Sherrys to Cabernets and Merlots. There had to be over 2000 bottles down here. So not only was grandpa a leader for a small religious group, but he was also a wine connoisseur. I wonder if he used it for religious reasons or if he just kept it around for himself. Either way, I had even more questions, that I hoped he could answer. I grabbed a bottle of Malbec and walked back upstairs. 

Having the basement, or I guess, *wine cellar* in the den absolutely made sense. As you walk back into the den, directly ahead is a small bar table, with a few different styled glasses. I grabbed a tall wine glass and filled it as high as I could. I myself, was *not* a connoisseur of wine. Perhaps, grandpa could eventually teach me how to be, but for tonight, it was all about getting relaxed enough to sleep in this new-old house. 

I curled up in a large chair, my wine glass in one hand, and a notepad in the other, and started making a list of everything that would need to be done to prepare this home for myself. 

Even though the property still belonged to my grandfather, it was hard not to imagine all the things I could do with it. Clearly I was no pastor. Definitely not a leader. There'd be no use for that upstairs chapel after he passed. I figured there'd be no harm in donating everything up there to a church in town. Then perhaps I can make the upstairs my personal area, and rent the downstairs to hikers and fishermen. Like a Bed and Breakfast. 

Who knew how far away this dream was from reality, but the thoughts fill me with excitement. Was is excitement? Or was it the wine? I didn't drink very often, and my head was spinning. 

This was probably a good point to stop writing. I placed my notepad and wine glass on the table next to me, grabbed a flannel blanket that was folded up by the fireplace, and snuggled up tighter in the large chair. Sleeping in this house might be easier than I thought it would be.

I’ll be visiting my friend in LA but during the weekdays she will be at work so I won’t have a car. She lives in Glendale, will this be an issue for me trying to go sight-seeing and exploring the city? Is the bus a safe option esp for a girl? Will Ubers be too expensive getting around the city? I am only 23 so not sure if I’m able to rent a car and also the idea of driving and parking in LA sounds far too stressful for me to be interested in. 

I am wanting to do one of the Studio Tours, I’ve looked into Warner Brothers, Paramount, Sony Pictures and am wondering if anyone has any input on which one I should do? 

I also was considering doing some type of Hollywood sight-seeing tours where they take you around on a bus. Again, any input on a specific tour to take?? I’m pretty interested in celebrities, influencers, reality TV, etc. so it’d be cool to do something where I see their homes but also open to any general tour of the city. 

Some other things that interest me is shopping on Melrose or Rodeo Drive (which one is better?), maybe The Getty Villa but not my biggest priority, the Santa Monica pier, trying Erewhon and In-n-Out, Alfred’s coffee, seeing the Hollywood sign. Let me know if I missed anything that sounds like I’d be interested in based off the other stuff. Obviously some of these things we can do on the weekend while she isn’t working and we have her car. The tours I mentioned are things I’d probably be doing alone and need to Uber or take the bus to. 

Also any recommendations for dinners or going out scene on the weekends? I’m sure we’ll want to go to bars/clubs on the weekend so wondering if there’s any iconic must-sees.

1ibbqbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1ibbqbb/im_not_good_enough_for_inlaws/,I'm not good enough for In-Laws,"I posted this in another sub reddit about 3 months ago and then updated it yesterday.

All names in this story are fake.

Even at the very beginning of our relationship, I (25F) and my fiancé Kevin (27M) knew we were going to get married one day. We weren't discussing it much with anyone else at the time. We had a long-distance relationship, and I would stay at his house on weekends sometimes. At that time, he lived with his parents because they needed help.

My fiancé's job sometimes requires him to attend pro american football games to shmooze clients. He had a game to attend on a weekend I was visiting, but I was planning to go home Sunday before the game since I had other plans. When those plans fell through, we decided that I would stay at the house while Kevin and his father Barry went to the game, then we would spend more time together after. He had been planning to take his dad for a while since his dad is a huge fan of the team.

I personally don't know how american football works and don't care to, as I don't like it. I’m also extremely uncomfortable being out late, in a crowd, or in loud environments. I’ve  have PTSD, anxiety.

My fiancé knew I wouldn't want to go to the game, so he made no plans for me to attend. Saturday, while we were out doing things, his parents, Barry and Belinda, kept texting him, insisting that I should go to the game instead of Barry. He explained that I wouldn't want to go, but no matter how many times he said it or explained why, they kept insisting.

When we got home later that day, all four of us talked. I explained multiple reasons why I didn’t want to go. They still pushed. If I said I didn't like football, didn’t know anything about it, or wouldn't enjoy it, they dismissed it, saying I would because we’d be in a suite and it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Eventually, I became exhausted and left the room to cry. (This should have been a red flag about his parents.) He was finally able to get through to them, and the next day, they went to the game without me. He did say how I explained it wrong to them, how me saying stuff along the lines of his dad would enjoy it more than me who doesn't like football made them think I was just being nice. Well I said many other things to make it clear I didn’t want to go. I honestly think he shouldn't have tried to correct me about how I was telling them I didn't want to go. He should have handled it after they didn't take me saying no the first time, I barely knew these people I shouldn't have had to beg them to take me at my word.

While I was at the house, I mostly stayed in Kevin’s room, while Belinda watched TV in the living room. We briefly talked when I went in there, but not about anything significant. I didn’t feel comfortable mentioning the type of engagement ring I wanted to his mother because this was only my second time meeting her. That would have felt very weird to me.

(My fiancé and I had discussed what kind of ring I wanted, and I told him I preferred a gemstone ring. I like the colors, rather than just a clear diamond.)

A week or so later, Kevin and I were texting about rings, and he insisted on a diamond because that’s what he thought I wanted. Due to past abuse, it’s hard for me to voice my opinion, but I trust Kevin, so I told him what I wanted and expected him to honor it if he wanted to be my husband. I didn't ask for a diamond, but I wanted someone who cares about my voice and listens to my wishes. With my past abusive situations I didn't get a choice or voice. Still, he insisted on a diamond, saying that was what I wanted and that I wasn’t telling him. We went back and forth for hours, and it was draining. I have no idea where he got the idea that I wanted a diamond. He eventually told me that I had told his mother I wanted a diamond when we were alone and they were at the game. But we never even discussed rings. Why would she make up such a lie? That is so weird and manipulative. Why would it matter to her? Wouldn't she want him to get the ring I wanted? That's the weirdest lie ever.

There have been many times in our relationship that his parents have belittled my choices or promised things and then gone back on them. He says they are busy dealing with family problems, so I should just get over it every time they let us down. I’m dealing with similar issues with my own family, but I still try to fulfill my promises to people despite this.

Even though he uses their busy schedules as an excuse for their failure to follow through on promises, Belinda still wants to help plan the wedding but has never reached out to me. I was just trying to follow proper wedding etiquette, which I was taught means the mother of the groom should reach out to offer help if she wants to. I also thought, if they can’t even do the little things they promise, how can they help plan the wedding?

Kevin and I have been living together, and sometimes, after work, he visits his parents. Every time he comes home, our wedding plans change. His mom gave him a list of things to remove from our wedding registry. She also doesn’t like the suit company I picked out blah blah blah so many things she doesnt like. She wants to send wedding announcements with the registry information to people who weren't invited to the wedding, which I think is terrible etiquette.

When she finally reached out to offer help, it was in a group text with Belinda, Barry, Kevin, and me. I tried to find something for her to help with that wouldn’t be too overwhelming for her. I asked her to help me pick out flowers for arrangements. I was very specific about what I didn’t want and what I was looking for. A few weeks later, she showed me floral arrangements with only the things I had said no to, and they were her favorites—something I didn’t know until Kevin pointed it out.

After I texted her about the flowers, she brought up another issue with the wedding: hymn singing. Congregational hymn singing is a part of my faith tradition, and it’s done at every wedding. Though I’m a new convert, it’s one of the most important aspects to me. We aren’t getting married at my church because my fiancé didn’t want to go through the required premarital classes (he's shy), and his father, who is ordained, will officiate (that's important to him so I compromised). I specifically found a venue with an organ so there could be congregational hymn singing. We actually had a fight a few days before because Kevin mentioned this to his parents, and they didn’t like it. When he came home, he tried to talk me out of it, but I stood my ground because it’s important to me. He realized this so after some back and forth, Kevin told his parents we would be singing hymns. I thought the matter was closed, but here they were, bringing it up again through text.

The way they brought it up threw Kevin under the bus and made him sound stupid. They basically acted like he mistook what I wanted and didn't tell them right because there is no way I could want hymns. They said people don’t sing hymns at weddings and that it would make the environment uncomfortable. After more rounds of back and forth, and with Kevin standing firm on our decision saying “we have discussed it at length, this is what we are doing, it's very important to her that we do it this way.” , his mother responded with a message that started, “It’s a mistake.” She went on to rant about how our wedding would be a train wreck. Kevin texted her one-on-one afterward because he thought her message was unnecessary and uncalled for.

She also scoffed at the idea of wedding programs, saying they don’t exist and are only for funerals.

So, apparently no one sings hymns at weddings, wedding programs don’t exist, and it’s perfectly appropriate to send wedding announcements with registry information to people not invited to the wedding. Got it.

Sorry this story is all over the place. I tried to leave out other issues with them that don’t involve the wedding. It’s always one thing after another, and I just feel stupid and not good enough. Even my opinions and likes aren’t good enough for them. I’m worried about the future and how they’ll try to micromanage, dictate, and judge our future family and our decisions.


UPDATE!

We got married in December. We had hymns. Everyone sang the one they knew, but no one knew the second one. I had a suspicion when I chose it that no one would sing it, but I wanted it anyway. I'm still glad I had it played because it means so much to me. His parents made me worry about the hymns the entire time, but I'm fine with how it turned out. I had made peace with the fact that, when I decided to have hymns, no one might sing at all, and I was okay with that. I was just worried the entire time about an ""I told you so"" from his parents. It wasn’t fun. People need to learn to mind their own business.

I don't remember what started it, but before we got married, we had another argument—probably about his parents, which are the only thing we argue about. Maybe I shouldn't bring up old stuff; maybe that does indeed make me the asshole. All I remember is that we started talking about the situation with the engagement ring again. What drove me crazy was that he said something along the lines of not wanting to call me or his mother a liar because he didn't want to choose between two people who both loved him. I was so upset that he was fence-sitting and didn’t believe me, even after all that time. Maybe that makes me the asshole again because I want him to take my side. I really just want him to believe me when I’m speaking the truth. To me, it’s about trust. We worked it out, but that was a big issue for me.

Whenever his parents have caused a problem, my now-husband gets upset when I bring up all the past things they’ve done because he doesn’t see a pattern. The only reason I bring it up is that I want him to put his foot down once and for all and notice the pattern. He hasn’t yet.

The morning after the wedding, he brought up another criticism his mother had of me. She didn’t like what I said when they asked how my dad was doing. It wasn’t disrespectful; it was just the truth about my dad. Maybe it’s a cultural thing, but it’s not derogatory in my family—it’s just a description and an accurate one at that. I would never talk crap about my dad. I love him; he’s one of my favorite people. My husband said that if I say it again, his mother said she is going to confront or correct me about it. That tells me that, when they ask how my dad is doing, they genuinely don’t care—they’re just saying the things they feel obligated to in normal conversation.

It’s rules for thee and not for me, though. From the first day I met them, they’ve non-stop trashed and talked badly about their daughter, even when I didn’t ask about her. They would just go on tirades about her, airing all her business, and they were angry as they spoke. Hate-filled is the vibe I got. They even did this in front of their grandson (their daughter’s son), who they have custody of. He is little, but that shouldn’t matter.

I guess next time they ask about my dad, I can either just say what they obviously want me to say—“He’s fine” (which isn’t true, and I’m worried)—or say what they don’t like and let her go off. Then, I’ll tell her how I feel about them talking about their own child.

Anyway, I was upset about my husband bringing up his mother’s criticism the morning after the wedding. We couldn’t even be married for a full 24 hours without me hearing about how his mom had yet another problem with me. He did apologize, but it just shows that I can’t say the right things to satisfy them. And he wonders why I’m so nervous and uncomfortable around them.

I also didn’t appreciate this conversation about my dad because, right after the ceremony, my dad had to leave since his pants ripped. I didn’t get any staged photos with him or time with him at the reception, and that was devastating.

Oddly enough, his grandma has been friendlier and more welcoming to me than her own daughter. His grandmother calls me on the phone every once in a while to talk, and we usually talk a lot. His mother never does. He has basically told me that it’s up to me to extend the olive branch and call his mother.

1. I think, typically, the parents or in-laws should do that.
2. Really? After everything, I’m supposed to be the one to do it? Seriously?

His parents often won’t come out and say what they want, whether it’s good or bad. Instead, they just text something ominous, like, “We need to have a talk…” Then, when asked multiple times what it’s about, they refuse to say. I don’t like that.

Once, after waiting all day to find out what they wanted to talk about, I got emotional. His mother was rude and exclaimed, “OH MY GOD,” rolling her eyes at me. I just don’t see the need to play games. Just say it. If it’s not something super heavy (and maybe even if it is), just spit it out. I don’t want to sit around all day wondering if they have a problem with something.

His dad even did this just to have lunch one day. It’s weird. I told my husband to put his foot down about this stuff, but he just shrugged me off, saying, “That’s just how they are.”

Their dog has bitten me more than once and has lunged at me several times. Whenever I played with my now-nephew at their house, that dog would follow him around constantly.

The first time the dog bit me, I was holding my nephew, playing with him in the middle of the living room. They were all in the room as well. It bit me on the leg, and I felt pain and let out a scream, not knowing at first exactly what happened. The dog has dirty teeth and doesn’t have its shots. It has bitten several people, including kids. Whenever I act nervous around that dog, his mother looks at me like I’m crazy and tells me the dog won’t bite me. She acts like I’m being ridiculous.
But it has bitten me—and others—before. Why wouldn’t it bite me now?

Months ago, when we didn’t have a dining table or coffee table, I would continually tell him to invite his parents over so I could try to have a good relationship with them. He continually made the excuse that we didn’t have a dining room table. We have not once eaten at a table when we visit his parents' house, so this seemed illogical to me. Then he also used the excuse that his parents had told him they didn’t feel welcome here. They did have a problem a few months after we moved in, saying they never see him/us, despite the fact I have told him to invite them over several times. My husband has to work a lot; of course, you aren’t seeing him that much anymore—he doesn’t live with you. I wasn’t too happy about them guilt-tripping him about this since, since I moved in with him, I rarely get to see my parents. My parents aren’t guilt-tripping me about not seeing them. My parents would come up sometimes when they can, and guess what? They were fine eating without a coffee table or dining table. They made it work. I guess it’s good enough for my parents but not his.

I was also a little upset one time when his parents came over. Instead of ordering something or me making something, the three of them went out to lunch. At the time, I could not physically leave the house. That one I probably shouldn’t have a problem with, but they make a big deal about not seeing me often either. So why not sacrifice and sit on the couch and eat like you do already at home to spend time with me?

On a positive note, I suppose they wanted to help get and pay for some wedding stuff. It was last minute, and again, I wasn’t involved in the conversation because after the hymn blow-up, they stopped group messaging me about our wedding. So once again, after he came back from his parent's house, he said they wanted to buy the tableware and drinks. I already had everything picked out and ready to order. I was torn between letting them handle it or handling it myself and making sure it was what I wanted and needed, especially when they won’t communicate with me, and it has to all go through their son. I also felt guilty about not letting them do it so I could save us money.

Turns out, they weren’t willing to do everything. Something along the lines of, they will get plates and stuff, but we have to get utensils. That’s just not practical in my opinion because I just thought it would be easier to do it all together and have everything in the same location. Also, there would be no room for error if either they or I got everything. There wouldn’t be a mistake of one of us assuming the other got something that we didn’t. Also, they were not willing to get the drinks that I wanted to have at the wedding. My husband said this was because they wouldn’t be able to get the right thing. All I wanted was tea and lemonade for the kids and for my family. I had also said multiple times that I would rather not have alcohol because a few of my relatives that planned to attend are alcoholics, and I was worried for them and others. They made a big stink about having alcohol, so we did have it. It turned out fine because none of those people showed up in the end.

Well, anyway, I told my husband that I would rather get the tableware if they were not going to get all of it. He wanted us to let them help if that's what they wanted. I let him handle it, and they got all the tableware. They ended up forgetting some of it at home, though, so I’m assuming one of my cousins who was helping to set up (love them) had to get them? I’m not sure. That was exactly why I told my husband I wanted to handle it so that I got the things we wanted and needed and that I made sure it was where it needed to be.

Also, a week before the wedding, his mother was making a big deal about ice. She was insisting that I tell the reception venue to provide me with ice and that I need to pay whatever fee they ask. When I first booked my reception venue, they explained that they wouldn’t provide anything extra that was not already listed and included. All we were getting was the venue, tables, tablecloths, chairs, and chafing dishes—the basics. Which was all fine with me. They set everything up for you, give you a door code, and leave you be. Works for me! I was not going to bother them with this or ask them for something extra when they made their policy clear in conversation and in the contract. I had made it clear to her they did not and would not provide it but she continually insisted that I pay them to do it.

I was already swamped with last-minute wedding things, and I did not need to beg the venue to give me ice. I had also told his mother before she told me to get ice from the venue that the reception venue is in kind of a strip mall, and at the opposite end of that tiny strip mall, there was a convenience store that would be open and had ice. I said this more than once and explained whoever in my family I could ask to kindly help out and get ice would have no problem walking less than 30 seconds over to the convenience store in the same strip mall/parking lot. Nope! She insisted I badger my venue to give me ice. Even if I had and the venue was willing, I’m sure the fee would be more than I’d be willing to pay for ice, especially when it can be obtained in 2 minutes very easily.

During this conversation, I also mentioned that I probably wasn’t going to have centerpieces and that doesn’t bother me. (If I wanted to have centerpieces, they would be blue since my wedding theme was blue floral, and I would have wanted faux flowers.) A few days before the wedding, my maid of honor and I happened to be at a craft store picking up some other wedding things, and she did ask me if I was sure about not having centerpieces, we could pick up some things at that store and make them. I said I was fine without them—the wedding venue is elaborate, and we can make the reception simple. I guess his mom was trying to be sweet because she got some wedding reception centerpieces for us. They were red roses, not fake, and some boutonnieres, etc., for the ones who didn’t have them.
Maybe I’m naïve because I really don’t think this was malicious, but my friends have pointed out things that make them think she was being a jerk. Their points are that she knew my theme was blue floral, and she got red anyway, especially when she had not liked the idea of me getting blue flowers for bouquets in the first place. She knew that I was getting fake flowers for bouquets and boutonnieres, and she didn’t like that either. So she got real flowers that were red to spite me. I honestly feel bad that she spent her money on real flowers that I didn’t need, and they trashed them shortly after. Either way, if she had good intentions or not, at least the centerpieces didn’t clash too much since I had a red velvet semi-naked cake, a red anime-themed cookie cake as a surprise for my husband, and an anime red-themed guest book. She didn’t know any of that though.

His mother does his taxes every year because she used to be an accountant, according to them. (She worked under an accountant; she was never an accountant.) Well, he asked me the other day if I want to file jointly or separately. I think the best benefit would be to file jointly, but my income is none of his mommy’s business. So if he insists she does his, I will be doing my own. Also, and I know a lot of people will disagree with me here, but I think finances are easier to manage from the same account. I told my husband that I’m too prideful and I have some debt to pay down from wedding expenses; I don’t want to share an account until I do that, but I want to share an account. He would be fine with sharing an account now, though. Maybe I should insist that we at least get a shared account now because I know for a fact his mommy still has access to his, so that’s too much in our business for me. It weirded me out when we started dating. Whether we do or do not share accounts now, or if we ever do, I just don’t like his mommy being able to see his expenses/our expenses if you want to call it that. I probably should just tell him to get his own account because I think the only way she has access to it is if she's also an account owner. (Yes I know that he could just give her the login but I think it's more than that). Yeah, mom has access to his bank but his wife doesn’t that's weird.

He has told me before that when he was a kid, his goal with everything he did was to make them happy. He also said that his sister would get chance after chance, be coddled, and get whatever she wanted, and he wouldn't get the same treatment. He says this in a matter-of-fact way: it is what it is. Is he suppressing his feelings, or does he really just think nothing of this? I’m suspicious that they are involved in his life so much and in our business because they can’t do the same with their daughter, who is an ex-drug addict and dealer. Maybe I’m wrong.

There’s a lot more significant and insignificant things that I could say about what goes on, but I feel like if I say more specific/identifying things, someone would be able to pinpoint who wrote it, and I do not need it getting back to his parents. Maybe I’ll get mad one day and air all my dirty laundry out for the entertainment of strangers on the internet.

At this point, and this is me being an asshole, but you know when someone has pissed you off and screwed you over so many times that even the slightest misstep on their part makes you angry? That’s where I’m at now. Trying not to be. I’m really trying to give people the benefit of the doubt, but after all this, I really don’t want to, and I don’t trust them.

They make me feel ashamed, embarrassed, anxious, self conscious, not good enough. They stress me out and make me mad. I'm worried about this stuff happening when we have kids. I'm different than them, our family will be different. They need to stop trying to dictate and let us be because nothing we do causes problems for us.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this, get them to back off and get my husband to see that this shit isn't normal without explicitly doing anything?",2,1737991714.0,motherinlawsfromhell,3,1.0,False

If I eat 1300 calories a day I lose a pound a week. If I eat perfectly for the next 350 days I will lose 50lbs. I'll still be overweight but the cardiologist says if I lose 50lbs I can probably start exercising. He says to come back when I've lost 50lbs. He thinks I will not come back, but I will show him. But I've been trying for 2 years. Sometimes I string together good days and lose some weight. But there are bad days and I regain it. I am still where I started 2 years ago. I still have 350 days to go. But I will do better. I will be good.

6am. Alarm goes off. I get up. Coffee with 2 carefully measured tbsp of creamer. Protein yogurt. Banana. 300 cals. Take my meds. Excellent start. Today will be good.

7am. Drive my kids to school.

8am. Home. I try to do some work. I want a snack. No. Today I will be good. I want a snack. No. What about one of my kids' packs of mini muffins. No. Maybe a granola bar? No. Another coffee? It's only 30 cals with 2tbsp sugar free creamer. Sure. I can do that. I make the coffee, I measure the creamer. I shower. I want a snack. No.

10am. Lunch is hours away. I'm hungry. I settle for a diet coke. I get a small amount of work done. Can I have a snack now? No. Just an apple? No. My day is planned. 300 cals breakfast, 400 cals lunch, 600 cals dinner. If I keep it to 500 I can have a little ice cream bar. Something to look forward to. Can't I have it now? No. Today I will stick to the plan. I will be good. I really want a snack.

11:30am. My husband needs a ride to pick up his car from the mechanics. He suggests we should eat lunch together at the Taco Bell next door. How long has it been since we had a date, just the two of us? Wouldn't it be worth it, just this once? No, I need to be serious about my weight loss. I need to have willpower. Today I will make good choices. I say no, I will eat at home. He's trying not to show he's disappointed. I feel sad.

12pm. I am home, microwave the riced cauliflower, the frozen mixed veggies, the chicken breast I prepped yesterday. Good. This is good. It doesn't taste good. I add more garlic. It's passable and I'm starving. My husband has come home with Taco Bell. I can smell it. He offers me an extra taco. No, I'm good. I am doing good today. I wonder if I should add a tbsp of butter to my food. It would taste better and fat keeps you full longer, right? It's better than eating taco bell, right? I am making good choices. I am doing good.

It's 1pm. I want a snack. I'm distracted thinking about toast. How many calories would it be if I just ate it dry? 80? No. Stick to the plan.

2pm. I want a snack. No one would know. No one would see. Just a handful of nuts, not even 100 calories. No, I will do good today. Another diet coke. It makes my stomach growl.

3pm. My kids are home from school. They're eating mini muffins. I want mini muffins. No. But I'm doing so good, can't I have a treat? No. Dinner is hours away. I'm hungry. Well maybe I can use 300 calories now and have half the dinner tonight. That makes sense, right? That's not cheating. More frequent meals are better, right? All the science says so. I believe in science. I cut up an apple, carefully weigh the pieces. Get 2 thin 80 cal slices of cheese. Count out the saltines so it adds to 300 calories exactly. I feel better, I can concentrate on work now. I'm less cranky. But I feel like I did something bad.

4pm. I want a chocolate covered granola bar. No. I want an ice cream sandwich. No. I think about my weight loss goals. I think about how important this is. I fight with myself. I win. No more snacks. I'm going to do good today.

5pm. I make dinner. I don't grab any sneaky bites. I ignore the bread next to the toaster. Why does my heart yearn for toast? Lol.

6pm. Time to eat. Finally. My husband and 2 teens have plates heaped with spaghetti and meatballs. I have a child's little plastic bowl with one cup of spaghetti, 1/4 cup sauce, one meatball. 300 calories. ""Is that all you're going to eat?"" My husband asks, concerned. He is 6'6"". His bmr is 3000. 
No, of course not. The plan is 300 calories breakfast, 400 calories lunch, 600 calories dinner. I have only had half my dinner. I make a second serving, awkwardly squashing spaghetti into a cup measure before dumping it in my little pink plastic IKEA kid's bowl. 1/4 cup sauce. One meatball. 300 calories. I know this means no ice cream bar. That's okay. I am doing good today. 

7pm. Can I have a snack? No.

7:05pm. Snack? No.

7:10pm. Snack? No. 

7:15pm. We are watching a sitcom. They make jokes about fat chicks. It makes me sad. I want a snack. No. I will be good. 

7:30. I want a snack. No. Every 5 minutes my brain asks for food. I'm sad I don't get to have the ice cream bar I was looking forward to. I white knuckle it, dig in my heels. I can do this. I will do good today.

9pm. I need to finish the dishes and get ready for bed. Can't I have one granola bar? It's only 100 calories. I did so good today, can't I have a tiny treat?  I'm exhausted from fighting myself all day. Hours of self control and 30 seconds of mental weakness puts me 100 calories over. 

As I write it down I realize I never recorded the cheese/crackers/apple snack. Oh, and I did end up putting that tbsp of butter, didn't I? And that extra coffee. I'm 500 calories over for the day. Maintenance. All that effort and I'm standing still. I did not do good. I go to bed. Going up the stairs gives me chest pains. 350 days left. Tomorrow I will do better. Tomorrow I will be good.",13,1737991676.0,loseit,10,1.0,False

1ibbhdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1ibbhdm/trip_report_jan_2025/,Trip Report (Jan. 2025),"—Mid January 2025 trip (trip started just after Christmas holidays and just got back). 

--I traveled solo; I'm a middle-aged woman. 

—Visited Florence, Turin, and Venice.  

—I took trains, booked through the Trenitalia website, between Florence and Turin and Turin and Venice. The only land taxis I used during my trip were to go between my hotel and the train station in Turin. In Venice, I used a vaporetto pass for travel around the city, which I purchased directly at the vaporetto stop nearest my hotel, and took a water taxi, booked online, to the airport.

—Since I know pickpocketing/safety is a hot topic here: as usual, I was generally left alone, save for one or two men who tried to butter me up for whatever scammy nonsense they no doubt intended to peddle (these men always assume that I am some lonely sad sack who can be easily flattered). I just told them to buzz off and, as is typical with men in Italy, they did so without fuss. However, I do speak a little Italian and generally know my way about these three cities, so keep that in mind as you consider what I'm saying here. I didn’t take any precautions beyond what I usually take in my daily life (making sure my purse/bags are zipped, not just leaving shit lying around while I go wander off to look at a shop display, and so on). On the trains, I kept my purse with me in the seat and my large bag in the storage racks at the end of the cars and didn’t give it a second thought. Not that I think that thievery from the baggage racks is an actual issue, despite the hysterics one sometimes sees online, but if some thief wants to try a quick cut and run with my 55 pound suitcase best of luck, lol.

—General cons of traveling this time of year: 1) for most people, the weather; 2) a lot of good restaurants and shops (not enough to leave you with no options, but still…) have a closure in the week or two after the holidays—anecdotally, I felt like my options really started opening up after the 20th; 3) it’s likely that a lot of stuff will be under scaffold/construction (for example, right now in Venice, parts of Piazza S. Marco are torn up and part of the Basilica facade is under scaffold)

—General pros of traveling this time of year: 1) it’s not 10 million degrees outside; 2) hotels are really cheap; 3a) Crowds are about as low as they get; 3b) the vibes were about as relaxed as I’ve ever experienced, even compared to my usual late Nov./early Dec. travel

—In other words, I don’t think I’d recommend this time of year as my first choice for a typical first-timer’s trip to Italy or if this is your one shot you’ll ever have to travel to Italy, but to someone who is a more seasoned/frequent traveler, I think traveling at this time could be worth it just to get a different feel/perspective than one gets at most other times of year. IMO, the big issue is whether or not one can take the weather. 

—I was very museum-focused while in Florence, as I hadn’t been to the city in quite some time. The Uffizi and Academia (booked about a month in advance via official channels) had their typical crowds, and the Bargello was shockingly busy as well, but the likes of San Marco, Santa Croce, etc. were extremely manageable. A lot of people avoid S. Marco because the hours are “weird,” (they really aren’t, but…) but it is really worth figuring out: it’s always quiet there and Fra’ Angelico’s work is so beautiful, especially when you get to see it up close. The last thing I visited was the Sassetti Chapel, as I have a tremendous soft spot for Ghirlandaio (as an aside, you can use tap to pay for just about everything, but not the lightbox, which requires €2). As usual, I was more or less by myself in the church. 

—I had the best weather of my trip here, unsurprisingly, and the city was extremely relaxed, even compared to my visits in late November and early March. It was quite possible to sit around outside and people watch, to sit outside in the Bargello’s courtyard and contemplate all the coats of arms, or to take strolls throughout the city without feeling too cold.

—In terms of dining, reliable Cibreino once again offered dishes from the regional tradition that aren’t hugely common on other menus at a price that let me have two courses, a glass of wine, water, and coffee for about €50. The Borgo Machiavelli restaurant in Sant’ Andrea also put out a tasty meal of traditional plates (but more crowd pleaser/familiar than Cibreino), with some notably good beef. I feel comfortable recommending it for larger groups and for people who will be traveling in that sector of the Tuscan countryside and are looking for a reliable option for lunch. I think it’s also an enjoyable daytrip/meal if you can figure out the bus schedule, but, IMO, it’s not enough of a destination that it justifies the cost of round-trip taxi or car service for 1-2 people from the centro storico just to eat there and do nothing else.  

—S. Elisabetta put out a meal worthy of its ** designation in the Michelin Guide. The quality of the ingredients was absolutely stupendous, the wines were as excellent (with the orange wine, dessert wine, and champagne as standouts) as one would expect from a restaurant with this designation, and the service was assured and complete, without being obsequious or long-winded. Highlights of the meal were the gamberi rossi, the pastas (the ravioli was a dish where you could genuinely sense the emotion behind its conception), and the duck, which was, as it should have been, the best of the many duck dishes I had during my trip. I know that some people really don’t like the layout of the space (and believe that is what holds the restaurant back from *** designation), but I appreciated that they clearly put thought into setting up my 1-top, making sure I had a nice view into the small piazza. 

—I love Turin’s portici and all its green spaces. Parco del Valentino and the Giardini Reale are two of the most well-known green spaces in Turin, and both have plenty of places to sit and read or otherwise people-watch. It was very pleasant to sit on the benches on the LungoPo in the morning while the sun was out. While I didn’t do any ticketed attractions during my stay here, as an FYI for others, the Egyptian museum, one of the most popular attractions in Turin, must be booked in advance. Other popular things to do include going to Venaria Reale, Superga, and the museum in the Mole Antonelliana. There’s probably things to do related to cars as well, since FIAT was founded here, but I have no interest in cars so I’ve never looked into it. There are two football teams, Juventus and Torino, for those who want to try and catch a match. (Tickets for the latter are easier to come by.) 

—Piccolo Lord did a fantastic duck, second only to S. Elisabetta (duck was the meat of the moment in Turin and Florence) and a decadent beef tartare. Madama Piola put out a hearty cipolla al fondo and some very nice game meat. (Also, I know this is basic bitch af, but I love their friend polenta sticks.) I finally made my first visit to Almondo, near Gran Madre, and had an excellent meal with good price-quality rapport. Theirs was the best traditional Piemontese pasta I had during my time in the city. I had an unexpectedly good meal at Kensho, with excellent sashimi and nigiri.

—In Venice, I visited my usual favorite churches and museums (Museo del Merletto, Palazzo Mocenigo, S. Maria Assunta on Torcello, S. Maria Gloriosa dei Frari), and spent most of the rest of the time doing my favorite activity of just wandering around the city taking pictures. For photography enthusiasts, an important thing to understand about Venice at this time of year is that the days are quite short—you’ll need to be in position in Piazza San Marco by 3:30pm or so to set up for shots of the sun going down over the Museo Correr end, and you’ve got to be in position in the bacino area for sunset photos of Salute, the Grand Canal, S. Giorgio, Giudecca, etc. generally between 4:00-30pm. My best Venice sunset shot of the trip was timestamped 4:17pm. For the best of sunrise, you’re going to want to be in position, depending on where you’re located in the city, sometime between 7:15 and 7:45am. Subtract about 30 minutes if you’re wanting to try and catch the very crack of dawn.  

—Right now, there are many parts of the city (such as the previously mentioned Piazza S. Marco, but also the area around Guglie, among others) that are under significant construction. The wind was quite strong during my visit, meaning I was uncomfortably cold if I just stood around or attempted to sit on a bench and contemplate and it was intolerable to stand outside on vaporetto rides across Giudecca or to Lido (aka rides where the boat can pick up some speed), but as long as I kept walking, I was fine. While there were tourists—it is Venice, after all—they were much fewer in number, meaning that it was easier to glimpse slices of quotidian life than usual. 

—For cicchetti, I eat at the Dorsoduro stalwarts (Al Squero, Gia Schiavi).

—I dined 2x at Pietra Rossa, the current project of Andrea Lorenzon. His previous place, CoVino, had been my favorite restaurant in Venice by the time of its closure, so it’s probably not surprising that I was so keen. Continuing the excellence of the drinks program from CoVino, PR had the best and most interesting wines on offer of any restaurant I ate at other than the ** Santa Elisabetta. PR also continues the brilliant use of vegetables and is one of the partners of the Osti in Orto vegetable garden—I could eat an entire antipasti of the fresh vegetables, honestly. Their saor was absolutely gorgeous. Their cuttlefish, while not served with polenta, was more traditional than not, the bigoli was the best version of this traditional dish that I’ve had in Venice in the last 10 years at least, and their stuffed pastas made tremendous use of the vegetables and herbs from the garden. 

—Indeed, my entire dining experience on this trip, but especially in Venice, was marked by a really excellent use of winter vegetables. They featured in a beautiful pumpkin and shellfish soup at Alle Testiere (another Osti in Orto partner). As is typical, every single thing I had at there was cooked to perfection; I’ve been dining here for nearly 15 years, and I don’t think I’ve ever had something here that wasn’t cooked flawlessly. As an FYI for future visitors, Alle Testiere was the only restaurant I ate at during my time in Venice that was still fully booked out even at this time of year, so the importance of early booking cannot be stressed enough if you are traveling at high-traffic times of year. 

—Zanze XVI put out the most creative set of dishes I had in Venice while starting from a base of extremely traditional ingredients: one dish, for example, involved seafood tripe along with the more common baccala. Their cuttlefish was served in a berbere sauce. They put out my favorite risotto of the trip. They also had really nice wines (a very close 3rd behind S. Elisabetta and Pietra Rossa) and even offered a hot tea alongside wine in some courses to allow me to experiment with how the different beverages affected the dish.

1ibb66h,https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1ibb66h/the_smallest_things_that_could_really_enhance_the/,The smallest things that could really enhance the immersion,"I know I have seen plenty of ideas but I think there are some extremely simple details that could have been added to Stalker 2 that would increase the immersion substantially!

1. Most obvious is more foods, drinks, add cigs etc.
2. Saving only on sleeps, or near a campfire, making the routes you take to be planned more often while trying to complete missions. This would clearly be more immersive with a sleeping bag mechanic as well and longer treks to be far more risky. Even on veteran and a weapon damage mod on my game, there is no risk when saving is too easy…

3. Make consuming foods, meds, drinks or proposed cigarettes more time consuming. Making you have to stop and take multiple puffs, multiple sips and longer to eat a can of food would make you stop and take in the sights a little more while also seeking a safe place to rest. 

4. Being tired, hungry, aren’t aggressive enough. Sleeping should be important on a 12-16 hour basis in game and should greatly reduce your ability to move and carry significant weights. Exhaustion is not something to mess with and I think going nearly 3 in game days is ridiculous in a sim-like game like stalker when your character is carrying 50+legs all day. And possibly reducing the exhaustion rate depending how resourceful you are as a player, like if you’re carrying consistently less kilograms then you would get tired less frequently, but if you’re hovering around your encumbered state, exhaustion would kick in far faster. This might be difficult to implement, but it’s an immersion idea. 

5. And last but not least, we are able to sit anywhere we want as long as we have a guitar. Even when sitting at a campfire without the guitar in our hands, we are unable to enter our PDA, go through our inventory, or consume any foods. Honestly, I think this is the biggest miss on immersion for the current version of the game. That should have been a no-brainer to implement, especially since we could already sit anywhere with a guitar in hand. So, if you added my already mentioned consumable time, and the ability to sit anywhere, access inventory, and consume what you needed to, then put a sleeping bag down, get the rest you needed, POTENTIALLY clean your guns with a cleaning kit, stand up, pack your sleeping bag up, drink some coffee, and start your next adventure. 

Stalker 2 is fantastic. It is among my most favourite games of all time. It doesn’t “need” anything added to be a good game but the list I made is something that would altar the game into the greatest, most immersive game IMO. Those few details would have made me never want to leave. Nothing is really keeping me going after 200+hrs in game and 3 play throughs. No I just sprint through the environments with no repercussions. 

Easier said than done I know, but what do you guys think could also be a more simple solution to immersion in the game?

I'll admit that I haven't been all that committed to restricted diet so it may be that this is the answer. However, I have read - conflicting things - that once symptoms start, it's advised to see your doc. I haven't had a major attack.

I suppose I'm wondering whether dietary restrictions (which I'm now starting!) are enough or should I go see my doctor as well now. Or wait to change diet first and see if that resolves things.

\
Craigslist is a widely used online marketplace that has evolved into a primary destination for purchasing, vending, and exchanging products and amenities. With over 80 million classified ads every month, it's no shock that Little Rock, Arkansas residents resort to this platform for their digital purchasing and vending needs. Nevertheless, using Craigslist in Little Rock, Arkansas, presents its own array of distinctive challenges and openings. In this article, we will delve into the dos and don'ts of utilizing Craigslist in Little Rock, Arkansas, to ensure a secure and triumphant experience for both purchasers and vendors.\

I’m 21, autistic, can’t drive and live in a small town where retail jobs or small coffee shop jobs are incredibly rare to come by unless you have a plethora of experience in *skill A, B and C* which I unfortunately do not have.

I am on a self-employed placement year as part of my course at uni, get very little student finance and pay rent for a house I don’t live in anymore due to having to move back home for health reasons out of my control. Despite paying more money for my letting agency to readvertise my room, they have yet to do so, and I can’t find anyone interested to take the room. Any finance from the government or university has went straight to rent, food and travel.

Due to Storm Éowyn, my family and I have had to pay for damages to our home, including major leakages and rewiring. I borrowed money off my parents in the past, but because of recent events, won’t nor want to do so.

My placement course team want to talk with me about my financial issues, but because I can’t afford to travel to uni anymore and fund my small business, they are considering kicking me out of placement and repaying money for the year, which is just under £9k. 

I have been searching for jobs for months to no avail and refuse to take out loans or borrow money from family or my inner circle. I genuinely don’t know what to do and it’s scaring the crap out of me, any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",0,1737989977.0,Advice,1,0.33,False

Both cats are fixed and have lived with other cats before peacefully and are non-aggressive with humans. Both cats are also very confident. I am following the Jackson Galaxy method to a tee.

My resident was hissing through the door and then blanket/baby gate, was trepedatious to go too close to the barrier at first, but she is now able to eat right across the gate with the blanket removed, and she has had 3 play dates with the new cat where she was chasing the string/laser and purring the whole time (the most recent play date was 30 mins!). She even initiated 3 separate face sniffs and did not seem distressed during/after. I was most worried about getting her to stop hissing, as I know being a female and the resident cat made her feel very territorial. It seems like she is no longer a problem. However, the new cat (who never showed a single sign of aggression seeing/hearing her through the gate and is perfectly content to eat next to her) starts to get this look in his eye after they've been in the same room for too long, and he tries to pounce on her.

The first time, I removed him before he even started to run to her because I could see him getting low and making a move to pounce. The second time, he ran up on her as she was entering the litter box. He didn't make contact, but he definitely scared her and she jumped out of the box. He then intensely sniffed the litter box. The most recent time, I saw him jumping onto the couch and looking down at her, then looking at her through the coffee table, and then he jumped onto the rug, wiggled his butt, and he successfully got to her and she hissed and lost a clump of fur. I had tried to distract him this time with the laser toy and string toy, but he totally locked in on her. They were separated immediately after contact and the hiss. My resident seemed in good spirits after he was put back in ""jail"" and she was purring and letting me snuggle her.

My question, is this aggression? Did he have some pent up energy? Was he trying to play with her? Do cats do the butt wiggle before starting real fights, or is that only for play hunting? I am keeping them separated again with no more play dates except for through the gate until I figure something out. I am also going to site swap every two-three hours for the indefinite future when I am home from work, as I am worried he is starting to act weird when he smells her (smelling the litter box, intensely smelling her favorite stoop on the cat condo during a site swap).

Also, I saw him raise his paw once and stare at her as they were on opposite sides of the gate, as if he was about to swat.

tl;dr new male cat keeps running up on/trying to pounce on resident female cat and I'm not sure if it's aggression or a misguided attempt at play.",1,1737989653.0,CatAdvice,2,1.0,False

Y’all were gassing me up about the double dose last night so I did a 30g dose, 100g bloom and 4 more 100g pours. Ground a tad courser than last night to compensate for the bigger batch like I was told would help for drawdown time. It did and the times were very similar. So thank you!

Now the coffee…

It’s more tea like in body and flavor profile. I enjoy that but I can’t make out any obvious flavor notes. Aside from soapy bitter aftertaste. I think that’s due to my travel mug…. Having soap left in it. Yikes. I just smell sponge and I’m confident a poor rinse job is what ruined this brew.

1ibarh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ibarh6/interested_in_female_friend/,Interested in female friend,"So I have recently been hanging out more with a female friend of mine who for the sake of this I will refer to as Anna. Anna had something with a good friend of mine a year ago and they broke up. All of a sudden she wants him again but is, at the same time, getting closer and closer to me. I’m the only person she comes to talk to her feelings or other things about and she doesn’t really open up to anyone else not even said friend. Over the weekend my parents were in town and I wanted them to meet her because she is super sweet. We got dinner with my parents and after I dropped her off to some of her friends before going somewhere else. Whilst waiting for the taxi I leaned back on the couch we were waiting and she started cuddling me. Mind you this had never happened before, only hugs which she would ask for very frequently and clearly enjoy a lot. I am not the type of guy to be very emotional and vulnerable with friends and most often only show „tough love“ so to say, which she does not appreciate, hence I am more open with her and often more vulnerable. In said taxi ride she kept cuddling me. This repeated after we had gone out partying and had both decided to head to bed early. Today, after the weekend we went for a quick coffee and she is more „touchy“ than usual. That is for the context. I think I genuinely emotionally like her and I do visibly find her attractive too. I do not know how to approach this since she is trying to fix things with my friend at the same time, yet again I am interested in her now. My friend is very contrasting to me and is an introvert, not ever having so said deep talks and hating to unpack emotions. That is why she comes to me since I am arguably emotionally more intelligent than he is.

I would like to meet just so we can have an initial conversation about it, nothing concrete because I don't want to rush or commit to any decision but I have spoken with estate agents, and gone through every option possible. It has been briefly mentioned before about meeting, but she also won't go to the house to meet (which I think is most logical meeting point), instead asked to go for a drink/coffee which feels odd in my opinion

Would be asking to meet the end of this week to have that first discussion be wrong of me to do? I do care about her and I don't want to feel like I'm pushing, but after how cold and distant she has been with me, showing no remorse, I feel maybe it is best to meet as soon as possible

I would love to hear your thoughts, and how any of you would approach this situation",1,1737989242.0,AvoidantBreakUps,4,1.0,False
1ibapzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1ibapzk/awful_blood_pressure_monitoring_timing/,Awful blood pressure monitoring timing,"Absolutely awful timing for my 6 monthly BP reading for shared care. Had issues with BP just before starting medication in early 2023 but luckily had it under control since with better diet and exercise. 

The monitoring normally happens in June and November. After 4+ months of no meds I finally started them again at the start of the year. During that time I relied on iced coffees to help focus in work.

I moved out alone at the start of the year too, and unfortunately i haven't been struggling motivating myself to eat well and exercise these past few weeks. Lots of processed food (still eating fruit and veg but that doesn't do much by itself)

Now I just got the text saying I need to go in and have my BP taken. I just checked with my at-home monitor and it's higher than it's been for a while. Plus, their wrist monitor is always higher than my readings at home. Absolutely shitting it now, it's completely my fault and I'm scared to be taken off meds again. Those 4 months were difficult, i don't want to do it again forever. 

To make matters worse, the text also says I need to book a medication review with a clinical pharmacist too 🙄

Going to try and turn things around over the next week or two to try and improve the situation before I go get measure. Just needed a vent. ",2,1737989204.0,ADHDUK,9,1.0,False

1ibap35,https://i.redd.it/1kdk0if0ujfe1.jpeg,TIFU by asking AI how to brew coffee,"After years of only drinking espresso in my home as my caffeine of choice, I messed up by not reading the very simple instructions Moccamaster provides about brew ratio.

I got my (new-to-me) Moccamaster the other day and did not receive any printed instruction manual with it. While normally I’m a devout instruction manual reader and connoisseur, I was excited to get started and didn’t feel like downloading the PDF which I’d already scrolled through previously.

So, I asked AI how many grams I should use (per Moccamaster’s suggestion and standard ratio) for the 4-cup setting on my machine. Somewhere in the middle, the AI misunderstood and very firmly declared that I should be using 40 grams of coffee for the 4-cup line on the water tank (500ml). I brewed and poured out several carafes trying to get my grind setup correctly on my (also new) grinder. While none of them were “great”, eventually I found one that was passable, once a healthy dose of 2% milk was added.

Tl;dr: instead of following the directions, I asked AI how much grounds to use in my coffee maker and it suggested 140% of what’s standard; resulting in many thrown away pots and some very strong coffee.

Standard chart included for reference.

Notes on how I’m making my coffee in case you see a standout problem:
- fill the water chamber up to the little safety valve
- put this amount of espresso grounds in.. maybe I need a different size grind? But I bought a whole bag of espresso grind
- brew it on medium heat with the lid open
- take it off as soon as it’s done and pour into a cup. It makes maybe 3 to 4 ounces.

Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa - The moment I smelled it a was like OMG this is sooooo goood, didn't get the coffee though, it isn't as sweet as people say, at least to me. After some time of smelling it, it felt very familiar, it smells like some sort of woman hair spray or hairdressing room, so I don't know how I feel about it now.

Asad - I do have to mention that I am a sweet fragrance guy. At first it smelled like a typical and boring dad smell, but with each passing minute it gets better, complex and sweeter, it is just plain good.

1ibag71,https://www.reddit.com/r/punchout/comments/1ibag71/a_drop_of_luck_chapter_1/,A drop of luck chapter 1,"Boxing isn't the only criteria when it comes to WVBA. While it's part of it, basically anything goes, from kickboxing to karate to wrestling and even gladiator fighting. Basically, as long as the boxer doesn't have a criminal record or is involved with anything labeled a Class A felony, such as rape, murder, pedophilia, drug trafficking, gang, or mafia-related violence, then anything goes. The WVBA strives to make its company as “family friendly “ as possible; however, it's not unheard of when people end up killed in these events. Occasionally you will see a scandal on the news of some boxer getting someone pregnant or entering a love motel. To keep their “family-friendly “ image, sex is frowned upon, and privacy is non-existent. If you even think about sleeping with someone, you HAVE to have permission from the WVBA. Unless your family is in another country, if you're even RELATED to a boxer in the WVBA, the family will get nothing but cameras in their face 24/7. To avoid too much legal trouble, participants need to be “18, “ and the WVBA has the best lawyers possible. Due to its relaxed and vague rules, it's a multibillion-dollar industry where you can leave and come back anytime. Another thing to note is that approximately 40% of the WVBA has a family related to another fighter, making it a family generational event too.


Because of the popularity of the family events, the WVBA hosts “family-friendly “ events every month, which are basically a reality TV show with cameras everywhere. 


On top of a roof is where Mac waited for his dad; meanwhile, below the ceiling, the referee, also known as Enzo, stopped by to check on “what's allowed “ and “what isn't “. He stood right in front of a 7ft tall man with red and untamed hair all the way down his face. The man, “Liam, “ casually chewed on a bowl of horseshoes. Liam is the father of Aran, Mason, and Maeve and spoke with a barely understandable accent. Liam's grey shirt was torn, exposing the many scars on his body. His teeth were jagged fangs that barely resembled a human's but were closer to a dog or a werewolf's. “What are you looking at!? “ Liam got closer to Enzo. “We have a strict no eating in this area, but if you hand me a box of those chocolate sandwich bars, I might let it slide.” Enzo showed him his hand. Liam replied by roaring like a grizzly bear. “Scarface, either you cough up the ice cream sandwiches or leave!” Enzo yelled back. A few seconds later, Enzo started screaming as he crashed through the glass ceiling with a box of ice cream sandwiches. “Hey, father! “ Mac waved at him, “I think I'm seeing...stars...” Enzo passed out. “Wake up; we gotta eat ice cream together. “ Mac grabbed a chocolate-covered vanilla ice cream sprinkled with nuts, then bit into it with a crunch. Enzo crawled a little then unwrapped an ice cream sandwich to eat with him. ”Father ..why did you let that hairy bear beat you up “ Mac questioned.  “Well ..remember how I said that we aren't allowed to eat in here ? That was a lie I just wanted to steal from the Ryan family because I despise Aran “ Enzo explained.   “Same ..the psycho is  a pain in my ass ..” Mac chuckled.


The father and son watched the  boxers and their families. 


“And 5 ..6…7..8 ..” Andre snapped his fingers “It's Disco time ! “ .  Kid Quick,  Disco Kid and Mr Sandman all boogied like it was the 70s . “Come on uncle, let's dance ! “ Andre yanked Jerome onto the dance floor .  Joe awkwardly sipped coffee with his father Gabby. Jay noticed Joe's leering at Aran, his face smiling and blushing at his crush. “Looks like someone has caught your eye ? “ Gabby teased his son . “More like my heart ..” Joe replied,  “Isn't he ..you know…Aran Ryan !? The most deranged man in..nevermind this is my fault “ Gabby shook his head .""He is really dreamy! His character, his appearance! Joe continued to smile foolishly., ""He has the personality of a honey badger with rabies and looks like a rat horse."" Gabby shrugged. ""He is a sweet pony!"" Joe retaliated.  He then got up trying to think of ways to get his attention.  “I may not 100% understand your taste in rat horses but as a father I'll do my best to support you no matter what ! “ Gabby pushed Joe “Go for it my son ! “ .

“Boogie to the left ! Boogie to the right ! You got it Kingsley ! “ Andre shook his hips . Without warning the lights randomly went out . “Hey who killed the lights  -AAAHH” a wave of punch,  chocolate cake and other confections poured all over Mr Sandman. “What the hell is wrong with the lights !? “ Enzo quietly yelled at Mac . “I have no clue …! “  Mac went  to check it out.  The lights flickered a few times  before it came back on, this time even brighter than before .  

  Joe fell face first on the floor before realizing what had just happened.   “You Glass idiot…” Sandman growled at Joe . “It was an accident ..” Joe back peddled , Before Sandman could land a hit Aran blocked the punch.  


*crack* 


 ""Ouch …"" Aran touched his black eye. ""I did it, not Joe."" The lights went out again, and by the time they came back on, Aran and Joe had fled.


The pair sat in an empty street , Joe blew on Aran's eye then shoved a piece of ice in his swollen face . “You didn't have to take up for me, I could have taken the punch “ Joe mentioned.  “I…you're just a weak boxer and I didn't want you getting hurt ..like what were you even doing ? “ Aran questioned. “I ..wanted to dance with you “ Joe admitted . “Oh…” Aran looked at Joe . “Sure  love to dance with you ... .but I don't know how to, though..” Aran admitted.  “Well….uh..” Joe looked the other way . “Unless it's the Irish step dance ! “ Aran yanked Joe and started dancing . “Wait ! You are too  fast “ Joe held onto Aran tightly.  “Did you say faster !? “ Aran started to shake Joe like a rag doll at that point . They both laughed as they looked at the stars together. 


“Thank you ..for standing  up to Kingsley ... .it was kind of an accident though “ Joe heart skipped a beat “The truth is ..for the last few weeks I've had a crush on..” Joe was suddenly interrupted by a kiss on the cheek by the younger man. “On you ..” His face burned hotter than the sun at the moment until he fainted . Aran caught him then gave him a hug. “I kissed him ..holy shit I kissed him …” Aran thought to himself.

Back at the party things are straight up haywire,  an elderly man named Quarlow and his grandson Dragon chan complained about everything.  “Back in my day our version of Parent Meet was killing wild Tigers with our bare hands ! This generation has gotten weaker by the minute “ Quarlow wasn't impressed.  “Agree Great Grandfather “ Dragon chan floated while meditating . 


""Damn you, Mac, who keeps switching the lights!"" A furious argument ensued as Enzo began cursing at Mac in Italian. ""MY ICE CREAM!"" Mac let out a horrified scream. ""No justice, I took them first!"" Enzo yelled. Before he heard crushing sounds, Mac cautiously slid to the opposite side and reinstalled the plug against the glass ceiling. ""Hold on, dad."" As Mac moved slowly, he noticed a dark figure. He tripped on a shard of glass, revealing his movements, before he could get any closer. The figure bolts it, forcing Mac to catch up . They chased each other in circles, unable to get a clear view due to the lack of light  . “He is so fast ! “ Mac squinted his eyes . Only a hint of moonlight allowed him to see anything.  “Tall…Red hair.….lots of freckles “ Mac reached his hand out,  long ginger hair slid through his fingers and he briefly saw their green eye. 


*smack* 

A boxing glove flail sent him flying.  

the stars in the night sky started to feel more and more real. 

“Red ginger hair..lots of freckles..green eyes ..”

“Was that Aran..”

***


Aran carried the sleeping Joe in the middle of the night until he saw the familiar face . 


“Oh hey ..”Aran chuckled. “It's good to see you out of prison Mason …”.


“Thanks brother “ The man exposed himself in front of the street light . Mason looked nearly identical to Aran and Liam as the “ rat horse face “ genes are strong in the Ryan family.  Mason had more freckles on his face than Aran,  two different colored eyes and a 5 o'clock ginger shadow with his hair even more unkempt than Aran . He held a box of ice cream sandwiches casually shoving one in Aran's mouth . “You would never believe where I found daddy's bars ! Some asshats stole them so I had to teach them a lesson, “ Mason laughed.  Aran swallowed the entire bar in one gulp , “you mean you were the one you turned the lights off !? “ Aran asked . “Well of course I did ! Also who is the old man behind you? “  Mason pointed at the sleeping Joe .


 “He is not that old ..,” Aran replied.  “Whatever , anyway I hope you don't mind but I'll be crashing in at your place tonight because I want to give Uncle Henry a VERY rude awakening in the morning “ Mason walked by him . “Don't you know that the mansion is for boxers only? I could get in trouble for that,  “  Aran mentioned.  “I'll live where  nobody would notice …” Mason suggested . “Oh brother…” Aran rolled his eyes in defeat . “Don't worry nothing will go wrong. I bet my lucky hat ! “ Mason twirled his leprechaun hat . “I'm glad you're out of that goose prison..in fact you're even taller than me !  “ Aran replied.  “Well it's only been two years..lad ,  my homeland doesn't take street fights very well “ Mason lit a cigar “We should go to the bar or something “ .  ""I'm literally holding a sleeping French guy plus in Brooklyn you have to be 21 to go to a bar and you're still underage.”“Come on Ari..don't be a bitch ..age is just a number when it comes to having fun ! “ Mason wrapped his arm around Aran only to get slapped away .


“Fine ..fine “ Mason threw his cigarette away then stomped it following his brother into the night

Equipping a new home kitchen can be an exciting yet daunting task. One of the key aspects to consider is selecting the right new home essentials kitchen items that not only elevate functionality but also enhance the overall aesthetic of your culinary space. From cookware to gadgets, each essential plays a vital role in creating a seamless cooking experience.

For starters, **high-quality cookware** should be a priority. Investing in a good set of pots and pans made of materials like stainless steel or non-stick aluminum ensures durability and even cooking. Don't forget about specialty pans, such as a cast iron skillet, which is perfect for searing and baking.

Next, an array of **kitchen gadgets** can significantly simplify meal preparation. Items such as a mandoline slicer, a handheld spiralizer, and a reliable food processor can save time and enhance creativity in the kitchen. Consider including cutting boards made from bamboo or plastic to prevent cross-contamination during food prep.

- **Sharp Knives:** A set of good-quality chef’s knives is essential for efficiency and safety.
- **Measuring Tools:** Accurate measurement cups and spoons are crucial for baking and cooking precision.
- **Mixing Bowls:** Sturdy mixing bowls in various sizes can be used for prepping and serving.

Additionally, don’t overlook the importance of **small appliances**. A reliable blender, toaster, and coffee maker can vastly improve daily routines. Ensure you have a versatile slow cooker or an air fryer, as these appliances allow for various cooking methods with minimal effort.

Finally, organizing your kitchen with **storage solutions**, such as stackable containers and spice racks, not only maximizes space but also keeps your kitchen functional and tidy. Carefully chosen new home essentials kitchen items can transform your cooking area into a well-organized and delightful space to create culinary masterpieces.

I usually just use my roommate's alarm as she's in the same class, but on the rare occasion I do have to set an alarm, I always set it to vibrate rather than to make any noise so she doesn't wake up. This was no exception. I've never had trouble waking up to these kinds of alarms, but this morning I was jolted awake at the sound of our usual 7:30 alarm. I checked my phone and my alarm for 5 was still going off, no vibrations while my friend had called and texted me several times and I didn't feel a thing. My thinking is, I just got a new iPhone 16, so is there any setting or something that would have led to my phone not buzzing at all, or did I really just sleep through my alarms?",1,1737987919.0,iphone,1,1.0,False

1iba8v0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iba8v0,A tale of two tipping policies,"Everyone is trying to figure it out.

First: a popular and much loved restaurant makes things super confusing. The fact that the surcharge goes 100% to the employees. Great. I don’t love the approach because it feels like a hidden fee, but at least they are giving it to the employees. But why only 4.5% in that case? Is this supposed to *replace* tipping? The credit card receipt still included tipping lines. Are you asking me to do math, eg subtract 4.5% from the amount I would normally tip? I don’t want to do that math, I don’t like the surcharge approach in general, and I am unclear what the *right* thing to do is. 

Second: very cool bookstore coffee shop. This is the way. Now, barista workers have a somewhat different compensation picture than servers in a restaurant, so I don’t know if this is a generalizable rule, or if it should be… but it feels like the right answer to me. Simple. Transparent to everyone. Reasonable. (They do still have a donation box, which the business gives to a named charity, which changes each month, and to which Ada‘s provides a matching contribution.)

1iba89b,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1iba89b/first_time_poster/,First time poster,"Hi I’m 15 first time poster 

a couple months ago I stumbled across this subreddit and thought ok I’ll hate read this i know what’s true

i my world blew up in my face 

I read dozens of tales of peoples experiences and the contradictions in the Bible stuff like the flood never happened, 1914 is a lie, the csa coverups it’s horrible 

I prayed out to Jehovah pls don’t let this be true help me my god 

nothing he did absolutely nothing 

I realize now he never Existed and this whole cult was founded on men and now I want nothing but out and being that I have to endure this cult for another three year is heart wrenching

so the reason I posted this is a car ride I had yesterday after meeting with my super pimi mother 

I just hope my family somehow doesn’t find this post 

so at meeting my mom asked a younger elder like in his 20s to talk to me about having bible studies because I had already expressed doubts before about JW he comes over and is like 

hey \_\_\_ your mom had said you may be interested in a bible study 

I say oh really, yeah he replied yeah no rush if Need time to decide just shoot a text 

I said ok thanks I’ll think about it 

anyway on the car ride home my mom begins this rant about how I need to make a decision cause serving Jehovah is not optional and idk what you think I want to help you and idk why you are having a tough time 

she eventually gets me to express some of my doubts i don’t want to say everything at once and I’m waiting to tell her I want to leave jehovah 

so I say death and sin came into the world through adam and Eve So what about the dinosaurs they died and had diseases and cancer well before Adam and Eve 

she shrugs it off no because sin didn’t come through them humans are perfect and are built to live forever and scientists can’t understand why we die 

well animals want to live too they have the same cell replicators as us 

she said there not made perfect and they live and die 

why? I said we mourn dead humans the same as we can mourn animals like dogs or cats why would a loving god let us love animals then have them die 

she couldn’t explain that and said I needed to think of it from his perspective and see he is all wise and What he does is best 

  
eventually the conversation turns to talking about sexism in the halls 

i said is all men created equal she quoted a bible scripture about it and said yes

so why are woman treated less in the halls 

she said the teacup and coffee mug example if you haven’t heard basically we are both cups that do the same stuff but coffee mugs are stronger and tea cups are weaker 

she started saying how satan wants your doubts to turn on you and take you out into the world and doesn’t care if you live a good or bad life he wins all he ever wanted was humans to worship him and In that moment I realize how programmed her brain is I agreed to a bible study just to keep her from crying and she also is signing us up for congregation reconstruction and Didn’t ask me

sorry for the word vomit I needed somewhere to vent 

been a stressful couple months for me hope I followed all rules and proper English spelling

I’ve tried everything, but nothing seems to work. The coffee always ends up tasting harsh, bitter, and cloudy. I can never detect the tasting notes described for the coffee I’m using—there’s no clarity or brightness in the cup.

I have a coffee subscription, so I’ve been using different lightly roasted coffees specifically meant for filter brewing. 

I’ve experimented with various grind sizes, ranging from very fine to very coarse. I’ve also tried different brewing temperatures, from straight off the boil down to 85°C.

I’ve followed multiple V60 recipes, including the 4:6 method, James Hoffmann’s technique, Lance Hedrick’s approach, and Matt Winton’s method, but nothing has improved the results. I even switched to bottled water in case my tap water was the issue, but that didn’t help either.

I’ve tried different paper filters and am currently using Cafec Abaca. For grinding, I’ve used both the Comandante C40 and the 1Zpresso Q Air.

At this point, I’m out of ideas and feeling frustrated. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",14,1737987704.0,pourover,55,0.94,False
1iba6dz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iba6dz,11 DPO - when did you guys get your BFPs?,"I know everyone is different so I’m not looking to compare - just wondered when you guys got your BFPs? 

I got my first “positive” yesterday at 10 DPO - super faint, barely much more than a shadow but still there, on a cheap test (red dye). Thought it was a dud so I did another cheapie which did the same thing. Then I took a Clear Blue rapid response and got a vvfl too. I bought another mid range off-brand today and got a SUPER faint positive line on that one. Also took a digital Clear Blue test yesterday and that was negative but I read that HCG levels need to be a bit higher for digital tests than for the dye tests. Got another digital test saved in case I get a BFP on a dip test. 

Just wondering when (if 🤞🏼) the BFP might come. Hoping and praying. I’m starting to get my hopes up because surely 3 different brands wouldn’t have given me false positives at the same time? 

P.S I know it’s still super early to be testing. From what I’ve seen on this thread most people’s tests start getting darker around the 14 DPO mark. Just worried I guess, because this seems to good to be true. Just want a stronger line to put my worries about a chemical to rest, for now at least. 

Pic 1: Clear Blue test yesterday 10 DPO

Pic 2: Off-brand test I took today 11 DPO

Also having a few “pregnancy” symptoms, though can’t confirm they’re related, I just feel a bit “off” and different:

- loss of appetite 
- mild nausea 
- coffee tastes like ass (I usually take coffee in an IV, can’t function without it) 

Between 8 & 9 DPO I also had mild cramping, which could have been implantation but obviously not confirmed. ",1,1737987699.0,TFABLinePorn,2,1.0,False
