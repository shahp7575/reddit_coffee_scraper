Our experience getting legally married in another country and a breakdown of our costs. Lots of details to hopefully help others!,"Hi all! I am finally excited to announce I am a married woman! I am elated to report that our micro-wedding (us and two guests) day went about as beautifully as we could've hoped. I wanted to take some time to breakdown everything I learned about getting legally married in another country to help others who would like to do the same. We are two Americans in our 30s. Please note that while we spared some expense, we did not try to do things cheaply for this wedding/vacation combo, and we had two guests who paid for their own expenses.

 

**Step 1 - Determine place, date, and your eligibility to be legally married there. What are the ceremony customs in the country? How many guests? Solidify wedding date and book venue.**

We were engaged in May and began planning early June for a mid-October wedding. I would obviously recommend more planning time than this, but everything worked out for us in the end. We have travelled to Slovenia, a tiny Baltic nation, twice before and loved it so much we wanted to get a Slovenian marriage license to commemorate how special the country is to us and our relationship. In Slovenia, foreign nationals may be legally married with proper application and documents. The USA will recognize a legal marriage in Slovenia thanks to the Hague Convention. Check the country's US embassy's website for marriage pages, they can be very helpful in breaking things down.

 

In Slovenia (and many European countries) you cannot be legally married in a church/by a religious figure. The ceremony will be conducted by local government employees (plus your translator, if required). We had to be married in either a location that has a license to host legal wedding ceremonies or at the local administrative office. We opted to have our ceremony on the lawn of a hotel in Bohinj for a rental fee of $250. There was also a fee of $200 payable to the administrative office for their travel to a location outside of the administrative office. If you want a religious ceremony, that likely must be separate from your legal ceremony, obviously with additional cost. For the love of all things, if you book an outdoor wedding venue, have a Plan B location for inclement weather.

 

Approximate cost to use ceremony location was **$450**. This does not include décor, etc.

 

**Step 2a - Book a wedding/elopement planner (bonus points if they double as your photographer).**

We found that many Slovenian planners/photographers specialized in elopements or tiny weddings like ours. We researched several people and after a few interviews over Zoom, selected a woman who was local to the area we wanted to get married in. Ultimately, choosing a local resident was hugely beneficial as she pulled a lot of strings for us and knew the best places to take photos. Through a series of video chats and emails, we communicated all of our ideas, plans, and the legal requirements for the ceremony.  I strongly advise acquiring a planner, as doing everything ourselves would’ve been a feat.

 

The cost for wedding planning and photography was approximately **$2,800**.

 

**Step 2b – Book flights, accommodation, car rental, travel insurance, etc. Buy dress, suit, jewelry, etc.**

Typical international travel stuff. We used a lot of credit card points for this trip which paid for flights and car rental (total **$3,200**). Accommodation for 2-week trip totaled **$4,300**. Travel and rental car insurance is included in our credit card. Don’t forget to get an international drivers license from AAA for **$30** per person driving.

 

Typical wedding stuff. Buy suit, wedding dress, veil, rings, and other items you want. Remember dresses can take many months to obtain. However, my dress was purchased and in hand same day in August from a used sample dress store. I made my veil using my mother’s veil. Total was **$3,800** (not including rings), most of which was the custom-made suit my now-husband will probably wear day and night for the next decade. In addition, decide about the taking of a surname. Write your vows if that’s your plan.

 

DO NOT put your wedding attire in checked bags in case it is lost or damaged. One tip that worked in our case was buying a garment duffel bag from Amazon for **$40** as a carry on for our wedding attire. This bag unfolds flat to insert the suit, then zips up into a regular duffel bag which contained my gently rolled wedding dress and jewelry. This will only work if you have a wedding dress than can be rolled/folded without issue. Alternatively, I’ve read online that airlines will try to accommodate hanging dresses/suits if they can.

 

**Step 3 - Determine the documents to supply to the country.**

For our legal wedding in Slovenia, we each supplied the following documents:

1. Certified copy of birth certificate (obtain from your birth state)
2. Affidavit of Single Status / Free to Marry -- Basically a document certifying that you are free to marry. The USA doesn't have a form for this. We wrote our own affidavit and had it notarized. Slovenia accepted this.
3. Copies of passports

1. If applicable: Certified copy of divorce decree from a previous marriage (obtain from the county courthouse)
2. Marriage application (signed and submitted in person in Slovenian administrative office)

 

Items 1 and 2 above will cost to receive a certified copy (ranges, $10-$20 per document), which can be obtained either online, by mail, or in person at their local office. Items 1, 2 and 4 must be apostlesed by the Secretary of State in the state which they were produced. This process involves sending the certified copies, along with a form and some money, to the Secretary of State's office. We had to do this for three different states, with return times ranging from same day (hand delivery to the office) to about 2 weeks (mailed in). The cost is about $20 per document. The apostille is a separate page with a seal that will be stapled to your document.

 

These documents will likely need to be translated by a locally certified translator to the language of the country you are to be married in. Our wedding planner gave us her translator contact. We took the documents with us to Slovenia and gave them to her. She translated them to Slovene for a total cost of $150 and was able to do it within a day.

 

Approximate total cost for our documents was **$300.**

 

**Step 4: Plan and book all the add-ons (décor, food, cake, hair/makeup, bouquet, etc.).**

The only add-ons I invested in were décor flowers and bouquet and a lunch picnic + wine for four people. Our wedding planner got us estimates from vendors. We also paid for a nice dinner for us and our two guests who attended. We booked our translator for the wedding day at a cost of $110.

 

Total cost for wedding day add-ons was approximately **$1,000.**

 

**Step 5: Plan the day’s schedule.**

To preface, we are a very easy-going couple. We wanted our wedding day to be relaxed and mostly unstructured. Our schedule was as follows:

·       Chill morning. Get coffee and breakfast.

·       Around 9:30am start getting ready for our lakeside picnic prepared by our planner and food provider. Did not wear wedding attire but had other outfits.

·       Meet at picnic spot at 11:30, eat and drink until 1:00. During that time our planner was at the hotel getting stuff ready.

·       At 1:00, we changed into wedding attire, which we brought to the picnic spot and changed in a seasonally closed roadside coffee shop nearby (LOL). Our wedding planner knew the owner and got the key.

·       First look, more pictures, then heading to hotel for 3:00 ceremony. Had time for an espresso at the hotel bar. Our planner gave us a brief rundown of how the actual ceremony would work. Yes, this is the first time we really got this information. Works similarly to American wedding.

·       At 3:00 had our ceremony in the hotel lawn. It was beautiful outside, and the ceremony was conducted in Slovene, followed by the English translation. Got married! Signed marriage license right there. Note that I (the bride) had to declare whether I was taking my husband’s last name. Since I was, they had me sign the marriage license with my new last name.

·       Hotel brought us sparkling wine and we conversed with the administrative staff and talked about our next picture spot. Had time to run back into hotel bar for a sweat treat.

·       Drove into the mountains for more photos until sundown. Went back to accommodation and changed out of wedding attire and went to dinner at 8:00. Went home and passed out afterwards.

 

**Step 6: Pack and travel.**

Again, all very important wedding items should be put in your carry on. A dress/suit in a hanging bag counts as a carry on and you will only be allowed a personal item (purse, backpack) otherwise. Hopefully you gave yourself at least a few days before arriving to your destination and your wedding day to account for jetlag.

 

**Step 7: Meetings**

Set up a time to meet with your planner and any other venders, as needed. We met with our planner the day before the wedding to talk about photo locations and where to have our picnic. In addition, we met with our translator to drop off our paperwork for translation, then met her the next day at the administrative office to sign marriage paperwork as required by Slovenian law. One quirk we were not prepared for was that they required the first, middle, last names and birth dates of our two guests who were to be our witnesses. Luckily they responded to our texts quickly enough but have this information ready just in case.

 

**Step 8: Get hitched!**

Self-explanatory. I hope you have the best day. My greatest advice is to be flexible and easy going, it makes the day so much less stressful when small things might go wrong. Don’t seek perfection this day. Focus on why you are there. You’ll sign the marriage license, so will your witnesses.

 

**Step 9: Back home**

At least in America, we have no federal registry of marriages. As far as I can tell, you don’t do anything with your marriage license unless you are completing a name change. You will need to provide your marriage license to the social security administration and your state for a driver’s license name change. You may have to have your marriage license translated to English, although the social security administration should be able to do that for you. I used Hitch Switch to help me complete my name change documents. I am just starting this process and can report back in a few months how it all went.

 

**Total Cost**

The total cost of our entire 13-night wedding trip (for *absolutely everything*; including rings, food, travel, accommodation, car rental, attire, wedding stuff, etc.) was just under **$20,000**. This also includes the $3,200 we technically saved by using credit card points.

·       For context, we usually assume $300 per person per night for our trips to Slovenia based on previous trips, so for this trip $7,800 for non-wedding expenses would be about right.

·       Our wedding attire and rings totaled $7,200.

·       So, the actual additional cost of the wedding day overseas was around $5,000.

1g7jwu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipproblems/comments/1g7jwu6/boyfriends_coworker_and_him_are_weirdly_close_am/,"Boyfriend's Coworker and Him are Weirdly Close, Am I Overreacting?","Hello everyone who reads this, first I want to say thank you for reading my post and if you have advice I would really appreciate it. Sorry about any typos.


So I'm going to call my boyfriend's Coworker, Coworker to keep everything simple, mostly importantly discrete. 

_________________________________________

I have been dating my boyfriend for almost a year now, and Coworker was always on the side lines cheering him on for pursuing me and being a friend for him in general. Now keep in mind this woman had 3 kids, her husband works in the same building as herself, my boyfriend, and me, and she is I would say mid 30s. My boyfriend and I are in our early 20s. 

Due to all of that I didn't think there was anything to be concerned about and just thought it was a coworker friendship.

Since my boyfriend and Coworker are pretty close when we started dating he wanted me to interact with her and try to be friends. He kept saying that once I got to know her, her and I would hit it off and whatever. I was incredibly hesitant about this because I had already heard and seen some of her ""behavior issues"". There's a common conception that she's rude, has an attitude problem, has a RBF, and is very short with everyone who talks to her.

With how much my boyfriend kept talking about how nice and fun this woman was and he's known her for 2 years so even though I didn't feel the vibe I still tried because I love him and I wanted to make the attempt for him.

So I did and oh boy, oh my god were the rumors right, she was not pleasant to me. She wouldn't look at me when I spoke, she would talk over me, she would keep my boyfriend's attention on her so even he wouldn't respond to me, and would physically block me from being next to my own boyfriend. 

All of that right there put me off from her and I wanted nothing more to do with it. So I tried to simply distance myself and it was easy for me to do so because we work in different offices so there was no need for me to be near her during my shift.

Unfortunately my boyfriend kept pushing and pushing me to be friends with this woman. This left a sour taste in my mouth and what made everything worse was that I learned she kept talking about me. 

Now you may immediately jump to she was shit talking and she may be doing this but I learned all of what I'm about to say straight from my own boyfriend. So she said this to him in casual conversation. 

She apparently would constantly make comments about my body, she would comment on how tight something was on me, my shape, how much cleavage I was showing, whether she liked the clothes I was wearing or not, how small or big my butt looked in a pair of pants and even would make remarks to my boyfriend about how he needs to keep me on a leash because of how I dress. 

(NOTE: I work in an office, I would immediately receive a write up and be sent home if I came to work dressed to provocatively)

So when an issue arose of me being harassed in the work place by a man who thought it was funny to call me names, she jumped onto the bandwagon and she said I deserved it because of how I dressed. This woman said to my boyfriend that she thought I deserved to be harassed at work and be called awful names because of how I dress.

From this point onwards I had no interest in being nice to this woman. I was beyond disrespected and hurt that my boyfriend after those comments still wanted me to be friends with her.


He is now aware that I don't like this woman, he is now fully aware I don't respect her and I don't want to even stand in the same room as her. HE STILL TRIED TO GET ME TO BE FRIENDS WITH HER.

_________________________________________

I'm gonna jump forward in time a little bit since after that incident a month or so passed.


One morning I walk over to my boyfriend's desk to see if he wanted to get coffee with me since there's a coffee shop in the office. He says yes, but then turns around and invites Coworker. My mood immediately sours and all three of us end up walking down to the coffee shop, I ended up being pushed to the back while my boyfriend and Coworker talked the entire time. 

We get up to the line and they are still talking. I get on my phone because naturally I don't feel involved and what I shouldn't have done was turn my back to them and step out of line. I will admit I shouldn't have done that as it was rude, but this catches my boyfriend's attention and he calls me out asking why I turned around. He says something along the lines of ""Coworker was just about to tell me about some drama."" 

My response was ""Well she ain't talking to me so it's not for my ears, is it?"" 

This caused a very tense and awkward moment, Coworker mumbled that she felt like she wasn't even there and she walks off so I do the same and my boyfriend follows me. This leads to a fight later in the day as he begins to opens up to me about how he thought my lack of social skills embarrassed him and how his coworkers thought I was weird and made them uncomfortable because I have a hard time talking. 

I of course clapped back that he was well aware that I don't like that woman and he kept forcing an interaction between me and her so I'm not proud of it but yeah I got nasty and rude. 

He can't seem to grasp why I don't like her even to this day he can't seem to grasp why and so I just dropped it. I completely and utterly distanced myself, I don't go over and visit his desk if she is working,if we are going to lunch together I don't even try to meet him at his desk I just wait by the clock out.

Thankfully up until the day I'm typing this out, I haven't spoken a word to her.

Not one. 

_________________________________________

What I've been beginning to notice are behaviors I don't fucking like, and the tipping point of why I'm even writing this.

She keeps calling him outside of work. Even after her own shift she will call him and the times that I've been present in the room during the call, it's work related at first but then it turns into a more casual conversation. The work related topics that I hear aren't about something like a schedule change or a team meeting that got scheduled last minute, in my opinion it's all work related things that are not important. For example one time she texted and called him at like 9 at night,and we were  having dinner and my boyfriend picked up the phone and I was irritated to say the least.

They have very sexual conversations, like Coworker will tell him about how her and her husband hooked up and from my knowledge my boyfriend has not said anything super graphic to her, but she'll ask about our intimacy. Again my boyfriend and I are in our early 20s she's in her mid 30s, to me, this is weird and unnerving.

She has so many pet names for him, most of it is just taking his name and sounding ""cuter"" when she says it like for example if someone's name is Mike, the cute version would be Mikey. I don't know how common this name is but I've heard her call him Papa. To this day I have no clue what the context was but still she shouldn't be calling him Papa.

Next, my boyfriend keeps sneaking her my food. So things I've baked or cooked he will try and sneak her some knowing damn well I don't like that woman and would happily piss in her food. He doesn't ask me if it's ok to give her anything, and honestly I like cooking and baking for others and I wouldn't care if it was anyone else, but the fact that it's her is why this is an issue for me. More importantly it's that he's sneaking it, MEANING HE IS AWARE THAT I WOULDN'T LIKE WHAT HE IS DOING.

So at this point I'm not going to share anymore, I may still write a second part since there is still more than I haven't included.

To everyone who reads this if you have advice or even a similar situation to this please let me know how you handled it, and if you feel like I missed some details or things aren't lining up let me know so I can elaborate further.

Met this beautiful girl in Indiana, but I figured I’d just vent it out. I already know the answer but here it goes. 

I’m from another city, a desert city that the vibe is different from seeing green all the time. 

Let’s just call her “ Annika “ and we met on Instagram. I’m actually a photographer, and I mostly photograph landscapes. I did weddings and portraits when I want to and we both agreed to meet up and hangout for a few days. 

At first it was the usual back and forth I was nervous then she was nervous. I wanted to make her feel comfortable so I sent her my ID, told her she could background check me and I also gave her references. So I felt it was a good move so she felt comfortable working with me. I do this with people because when I’m traveling I want to get locals perspective on the areas so I can get beautiful landscapes shots that I know will sell for my art gallery prints. 

Annika also said it would be cool for she modeled for me. She was an average girl, black hair blue eyes and kinda of a big nose. She was above average in looks and she just looked like your everyday mid western woman who was pretty and was easy going to talk too. 

During that time, she was working as a waitress and she recently got let go because the managers there started not training her and treating her badly due to lack of training in the work environment so she quit. She was broke but happy. 

I am a pretty good business man, own a few small businesses and I wanted to get my  photos for my gallery so I could sell them as prints. The last few days before we left she was ecstatic about meeting me and I even told her we should slow it down and see how it goes. So just in case I prepared in case she was planning on ditching me. Because we agreed to drive around her small town in a van ( she named BESSY ) 

She was devastated about loosing her job and she seemed down because I’m sure she had other ideas. I wanted to cheer her up so she had been telling me how she liked “ Serbian culture “ so I found a church and store with a bunch of cool Serbian items coffee mugs, candy, cookie cutter etc. Stuffed it in my bag and packed it ready to leave. 

I kept telling her if at any point she changes her mind I can just photograph the landscapes myself and don’t worry about me. But she insisted on being with me. I was happy to know she was committed. 

Day 1: The arrival 

It was an hour drive from the major city to her town. The Uber ride was expensive and I had made previous plans to workout and train some martial arts. Our dinner plans was at 9pm at the best restaurant in town. I ended up leaving my training session to go see her. 

When I get to the restaurant, this girl was waiting for me. I was nervous because normally I’m so used to this. I’m used to seeing a pretty girl dressed up and ready to chat. It was normal. But she was different. I saw her, greeted her and her smile was white and comforting. We both seemed to connect. 

I sat my camera on the table and watched her to make sure she was comfortable and I first served her bread. I asked her “ do you mind if I serve you bread “ I poured her water etc and I wanted to lead in the interview because I wanted to get good shots this weekend show her I was a sincere guy. 

She laughed. I had this terrible hairline cut from the barber and I couldn’t stop talking about it. She thought it was stupid and told me to remove my hat that I got from the Walgreens so she wouldn’t see it. Finally i reluctantly took it off. We both laughed and talked about each other and I remember being it light hearted and fun. 

That night we just had a good time. I asked her if she still wanted to do this. And she said absolutely. 

Then something happened. 

After dinner, on our first day / date or whatever it was she was absolutely drunk. Because I’m not a drinker I was pretty concerned. 

She realized that she could not drive home. Her mother kept calling worried that she wasn’t home yet. So she lied and tells her she’s alone even though she’s with me! She’s starts walking me around the town. I remember thinking in my head “ does she do this with every guy she meets or am I just much of a nice guy I just give off weak vibes that she can just get drunk off her ass “. 

I remember as we were walking through the town his drunk she was and for like 3 hours until 2am she wanted to take a piss. So she goes behind the bush at the rail track does it behind a bar. Classy right? Worried I didn’t want anything to happen to her and we made jokes about “ if someone murdered  you if definitely be the first suspect “. I know bad humor, but it was funny at the time. 

Her stomach started hurting bad. So we walked back to the  car. And I was exhausted from my trip. We got in the car, and her car was trashed. Look like she had a bunch of things in it. So imagine this drop dead gorgeous girl with an ugliest van you’ve ever seen. I don’t know  why but I found it interesting. 

We drive. 

Get to her house. I’m thinking it’s this going to be a trailer park. Nope. Half a mile in it’s her parents driveway. Giant land and property and the entrance was huge. I couldn’t believe it she was one of the richest families in the town. Her house look like something from a home depot commercial. She stayed out told me ti play it cool and if was anyone else she wouldn’t have gotten that drunk and she told me previously that day she was on a date with a guy. So she had been drinking. Ouch. 


Day 2: Her mother surprises me. 

Woke up late. Dammit I missed the sunset shot. But I was tired from  dealing with her being drunk last night. But she looked like she was ok. Her mother freaked out. Demanded that she be there while I did  her photos, and she wanted to make sure I wasn’t some creep. 

Completely understandable. I didn’t blink and said I had nothing to hide. She was in her 20s and though she was of age I understand where the mom was coming from. I explained to her that I was building my portfolio and I had nothing to hide and I was transparent with my intentions. She was a good mother, I could tell. It actually made me appreciate Annika more. 

The mother understandably when we met asked me tons of questions. Who I was why I’m here. Why her? And I was completely honest. Said she was extremely beautiful, she also seemed hard working and she offered to help me build my portfolio but if she bailed I’d make other plans. As I begun to take pictures and showed her my work through my camera she started to calm down  significantly. 

Her words made me smile when she said things like “ you seem too good be true “ and “ you really have these businesses “. 

The mother and her being born and raised there showed me the best spots to get absolutely stunning photos for my gallery. By the end of the day Annika was happy that her mother was happy and I wasn’t some crazy person trying to do anything wild. 

We ended the night. Got some amazing photos during the sunset and got to know her mother. 

Day 3: The last day 

Woke up late again. So did Annika. I take an Uber to her giant mansion. I meet  her there, and her mother is waiting. He father is busy running the property and we start exploring her land her parents own. We photograph the abandoned barn. And we come back. Mom insist to let me in the house. And I accepted it because I didn’t want to invade boundaries. 

We continue during the day shooting all around her small town. Spend the whole day together. It was almost like a job and was fun. I take her to a very expensive bridal store and buy her a black dress. Unfortunately we never get to use it in our photo. 

We photograph where the rail roads are ironically where she when she was drunk and took a pee. The first  day. 

I keep taking photos. Etc. and we end up realizing time is running out. We planned a hike to go into Lake Michigan into a forest. 

While we photograph the hidden railroads she cuts her foot, bleeding and it kinda makes a cool shot. I carry her because she couldn’t walk and held her hand as she needed help getting through some of the forest behind the railroad. That’s when feelings started. 

Maybe I’m over analyzing it. I’ve dated numerous pretty girls. And I just didn’t care until that moment happened. Maybe I’ve just been lonely for so long I just forgotten what it was like to be around a beautiful girl. 

THE GIFTS : 

Before I ended the day I bought her mom a glass jellyfish and flowers 💐 and a $40 gift certificate to the store. For showing me around even though  I was a stranger. 

THE BRUTAL HIKE: 

So we arrive into our hike. Thinking it would only take a couple hours I brought all of my heavy gear. She wore a red roses dress. And boots. We even bumped into a snake. At first I was enjoying the scene beautiful marshes and flowers. 

I realized the sun was setting and in landscape photography missing the sunset is a huge waste of a shot and I timed the weather so we would have clouds in the shot so we could get the colors. She started walking ahead of me. She was a fast moving woman, lighting fast. And even took off her boots and started running in the forest. Like a Ninja. It was wild. Barefoot too. 

She was half a mile ahead. My gear was extremely heavy she even offered to  help me carry it. And I refused. Embarrassing for me rather but she ran ahead. She even wore my shirt as she ran through the forest. I was outta shape and outta breathe. 

As I got to the end the trees got darker I was worried I was going to miss my shot and waste my trip. 

THE FINAL SUNSET : My embarrassment 

The sunset as I lay there absolutely exhausted Annika said “ HEY ! Over here run here! “ I dropped down a huge sandy hill all the way down to the beach lake. The sunset was incredible and I was breathing hard. I was outta shaped and frustrated but I barely made the sunset. Pulled out my camera and set up my camera. And her smile made me life fast or I’d miss the moment. I took a pano shot of the whole area. It was stunning the reds and oranges and purples made it amazing. 

As I made my way into the beach we met up and I started taking picture of her in her dress. She was a natural never modeled before but she got every shot with natural beauty and vibe barely tried. We got amazing shots of her walking in the beach as well as her and the colors were spot on. 

She wanted to leave but I wanted to enjoy the view just for a few more minutes as I watched the sunset go down. 


BEING LATE: 

We knew dark was settling we needed to hike back and luckily I had my lanterns on me so we could see the trees at night and pathways. The mother as usual blasted her phone and started to worry. Told her to blame me because I was trying to get the shots. We started to walk into the forest and walk as fast as I could.  
We hit a fork in the road, and I made a mistake about choosing the road pathway and it took longer to get to the car. 

I COLLAPSE: 

My body was absolutely exhausted and at the end my leg finally cramped due to the weight of the all the gear. I ended up my leg gave out on me and I had to rest. By then it was dark and as usual Annika was way ahead of me trying ti find the plate car. But she knew the area so she said id be back for you to grab the van. 

I was mortified, here I am. 5th degree black belt and my leg cramped. To a girl I’m starting to have a crush on? Really? As my leg was in absolute pain I got back up and started walking in the road. Outta shape, and annoyed at myself I just kept walking. 

I later started running the mile because of this. 

We get back she goes home to grab stuff so she can get ready tells her mom she’s alive. And she decided to spend the rest of the night if the AirBB with me did more photos. 

She asked for dinner. I get my favorite Bob Evan’s. Which is country American food and we have it Uber eats. To my AirBB which is like 30 minutes from her house. 

THE FINAL PHOTOS THAT NIGHT: 

So originally we talked about boudoir shots. Or lingerie photos. She also mentioned she had no romantic interest in me. Which hurt but I accepted. But the whole weekend felt like a giant date. So I was confused.

She was adamant about feeling comfortable. So she loved this 90s show called Fraiser and she wanted to eat. And I wanted to set the bath tub so we could do a flower shoot in the bathtub for a creative shoot. 

As she watched Fraiser basked her, “ are you sure you want to do this “ Annika responded “ yes, I want feel sexy and your a photographer you’re make me look amazing “ 

I mean she wasn’t wrong. I am a brilliant photographer and a great martial artist as well. She felt safe around me. Which made me feel good as a man. 

Annika then saids “ sit down with me let me show you my favorite episode it’s funny. The dads pretends to be gay and he lies to this girl that likes him “ I shut down my computer and I sit with her. We watch we eat. We laugh. I actually had a good time. It was pretty funny. I remember laughing next to her and enjoying it. 

I remember how tired she was. For the hiking and I remember her saying she wanted a massage from me a few days ago. I asked her if she still wagged it. Her response, “ omg that sounds amazing “ we go in the room. 

She lays in the bed. I begin the massage her. She had a shirt at first and takes it off. Starts to take off all her clothes. But tells me she on her period. I’m fine with it. I had no interest in doing anything sexual. I just wanted to make her feel better and I wanted to see maybe it would give me a shot later. Maybe she would like me. 

She strips to her thong and all. I massage her every where. She laughs and enjoys it. I made sure I asked for her permission. After she said I couldn’t believe I actually knew what I was going. I explained my sister was a massage therapist and she showed me me a few things. I see it all and when I say she had the most perfect body I’ve ever seen it was to me 10/10. This girl to me physically was perfect in every way. 

We start to photograph. It was like she done this before. She had different lingerie and she strip naked didn’t care I saw her naked. It was like she knew me for years. I started to sweat. NEVER in my life, ever have I felt that way. Hundreds of girls but she was different. 

She made me laugh, playfully played with her strings and didn’t show any nudes in her photos. Starred at the camera and just had fun.  She even met me kiss her on the forehead and she kissed me in the cheek. After we got the shots. We went into the bath tub to get the flower shots in a white dress. 

I was shaken. This girl I I’ve only known 3 days. Was just sucking me in. She told me she might visit me but I knew that was probably a lie at the time. 

She packed up got  in her car and drove back abd left her boots. Quickly because her family started blasting her phone. 

DAY 4: THE MORNING BACK HOME 

I didn’t  sleep. I texted her cause she left her boot. Had the Uber driver drop it off later. Had the catch my flight. Distraught I thought I met the love of my life but I knew I was just fantasizing. I stayed up all night cleaning the place knowing I couldn’t miss my ride. It was an hour back into the airport. 

I fly. 4 hour ride. Back home. I couldn’t stop thinking about her. Every second. Everything we did together. I’m supposed to be a professional  dammit. I send her contract we sign an NDA for her lingerie photos stating that those are hers and full rights are hers. Did the prints, because I did feel   bad about her loosing her job I agree to 20% commission in whatever prints sells once we run ads. So she gets some money for all the locations she brought me. 

Week passes. I tell her she’s special. Unique. I tell her she’s different. Then one day. Week after that she saids good night. 

We have gone 3 weeks no contact. No text. No likes. No views. I’m not breaking the no contract rule. She’s probably moved on. She probably does this with multiple men. 

I miss her. Her smile, her laugh and her voice. I’ll forget her. She was the only woman I’ll never forget and if I could I would treat her better than any other men alive. 

But if I chase her, I know it’ll end and it’ll destroy me. She needs to come to me so I’ve gone silent. 3 weeks. 

My assistant texted her since we are on contract making sure she was getting payments from sales.

I’ll miss her. A lot. I hope I get to see her one day again. Because I know we both had an amazing time. Amazing food. And an amazing memories together. 

Or maybe to her, I was just another guy that never had a chance.

I get jealous when other girls flirts with him or when he flirts with another girl, like I know we're nothing but it hurts me 🥲. 

Ares isn't exactly my type but he's caring, nice and helps me out a lot if I'm having troubles with my work.

This is normal mess levels of house with kids and dogs, no sense faking it 😅. The tablecloth doesn’t match and will be replaced - primary palette is the salmon and some teal pops.  

We usually eat in the kitchen but the dining table is nice to have for occasional dinners and for kids activities

Problems I want to solve for:

1.  The couch area is crowded and kinda feels like we are spying on our neighbors!  We are kind on a hill so it is private at least.  My wife and daughter don’t want the couch against window

2.  Everything just becomes stuff storage.   We don’t have an entryway or entry closet.  We’ve tried everything. The armoire should  contain it, but it doesn’t get much use.  The shoe bench is working well but small.  

I’m thinking of ditching the coffee table. adding 2 storage poufs (patterned / warm) and a soft rug.  I might need to remove the dining rug to avoid over-ruggage 😅

I’m currently “just a drip” Ninja Specially “rich setting” coffee maker person with that horribly loud cuisinart grinder to pull out 2x18oz cups of coffee each morning which get doused with half and half and a little bit of sweetener.

What’s wrong is that I am resenting the setup of the maker each night, where as I need to grind the beans before my Spouse goes to bed, accidentally spill coffee dust all over the counter, and make a bit of a mess refilling the tank and rinsing the filter which just fits under our cabinets.

And after staying at a vacation house many years ago, where there was a fully automatic coffee machine that spit out the used grounds in a little drawer, I’m kinda lost in my search through the land of machines, not really knowing what’s what.   

So with said, are there any good solutions which:

- have a water line hook up
- air tight bean storage/grinder
- discard drawer for multiple cups
- makes a larger cup 16oz+ (tall traveller)
- timer 
- ideally less than 12” wide.

Ideally I’d like something denominated in USD, which is only 3 digits ahead of the decimal point; but will pay for ease & reliability if that’s what it takes.

1g7jj2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1g7jj2y/dental_implant_placed_too_deep/,Dental Implant Placed Too Deep?,"I have a long history with my front tooth, but here's a summary of my situation below:

* 10 years ago, I broke part of my front tooth on a glass bottle which resulted in me getting a crown on it. I didn't have any problems with my crown until the last few years or so it was puffy around the crown. My old dentist thought it was because my gum tissue didn't like the material of the crown. Fast forward to last November, I hit my front tooth down hard on a coffee cup and about 5 days later I started having insane pain. I went to see my new dentist and he said I needed a root canal right away but it was Friday evening so he put me on antibiotics over the weekend until my root canal appt with the endodontist on Monday morning. I got my root canal done and the pain stopped, but I still felt like something was off with my tooth when I tried to bite down on it. A few weeks go by and it's still the same, so I go back to the endodontist and he said he thinks it's my gums. When he flossed around my existing crown they started bleeding a lot. (But only on this tooth). So I went for a second opinion at another endodontist and he said it was my bite that was off and proceeded to adjust my crown 4-5x over 1.5 months. Well that didn't solve anything...
* So in March of this year I went to get a consultation with a periodontist after my dentist was pretty sure it was a vertical tooth fracture that wasn't showing up on the x-ray. The periodontist suggested my dentist to take off my old crown and wait 6 weeks to see if that was the problem, but at this point it had been 4 months and my gums were not happy and I was over with it. I decided to move forward with a dental implant instead.
* Finally, on April 3rd, I had my tooth removed and my dental implant placed during the same surgery. Now for the next 4 months of healing, I noticed my gums were not healing as quickly as I would have thought. But I sent a picture to the periodontist's office to double-check and they said the slow healing is normal. (They said they don't do follow-up appts and that was the best way to get my questions answered.)
* On July 30th, I had the healing abutment placed and my periodontist said my gums still looked irritated. He assumed it was the bone graph material still coming through.
* On September 17th, I had my first round of molds done, but the lab ended up saying the abutment piece that was provided wasn't going to be long enough and that I needed a custom abutment and that I'd need to redo my molds.
* On September 23rd, I had my second round of molds done, but my dentist noticed a lot of bone graph material still coming through so he reached out to my periodontist and he said to wait 3 more weeks before moving forward with the final tooth. The periodontist also wanted me to come in to do a gum scrub around my healing abutment because it looked irritated.
* On September 25th, I had the gum scrub done.
* On September 30th, I went to see my dentist because I noticed a bump on my gum. I had an infection... so he put me on antibiotics right away and said I needed to see my periodontist first thing in the morning. Morning came around and I walked into the periodontist office and discovered he was in Europe for 3 weeks, just my luck. I went back to my dentist's office and he called up a periodontist he works with often and he wanted me to come in right away. He removed the healing abutment, cleaned around the site and noticed an infection on the surface of my implant but it had not been affected yet. He put me on stronger antibiotics for 2 weeks and wanted to do a follow-up the following week. The next week he shared the results of my CT scan saying there was bone loss around the dental implant and also minor loss on my adjacent front tooth.
* Between October 9-14th we didn't have power in our city due to the hurricane. What horrible timing!
* On October 17th, I was finally able to my original periodontist who had placed the implant and he said everything looked good and I was good to go with the placement of my final tooth. But the thing is he never removed the healing abutment to look around. He said you can get infections from food getting stuck in the healing abutment. He also said the bone graft material was still coming through because he typically overpacks the site. He then showed me my original CT scan and said my bone was like that at the beginning of the process.

So now here I am utterly confused. My dentist is worried about how deep the dental implant was placed and it causing future problems. The questions I now have are: Why wasn't the tooth removed and then a bone graph done before starting the implant process? Could I have had periodontal disease from my 10-year-old crown and this caused a majority of my issues? And what are the long-term complications of having too deep of an implant?

If anyone has any insight to offer, please share. This has been a nightmare situation this last year and I could really use some advice!!

\*\*Please note on the x-ray image, what's not showing is the healing abutment which is translucent but it's screwed into the implant.

1g7jigz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1g7jigz/so_i_wanna_build_a_cafetavern/,So I wanna build a cafe/tavern,"So for frame of reference I’ve been playing the game for about a month and only just started heavenward, and my FC decided to run around and check out some houses. I took a particular in cafes and taverns and have gotten a craving to create one. I wanted to create fun little cafe or tavern that people can show up in, serve them some food, chat and rp. And this would be a personal house of mine not an FC house. However I’ve run into a few problems and want to ask how to possibly find solutions. 

1. Money. That sweet sweet Gil baby. Which I lack any of. I’m sitting at about 500k currently yet have no idea how to get a large enough amount of potentially buy a small or medium plot of land for a cafe/tavern. What ways can I potentially rack up the cash? I’ve heard raid food cooking is good and I’ve already leveled culinary to about level 30 or so as I mean to make the own dishes I’ll serve in the cafe/tavern. So is there any effective way to get the funds for my project? 

2. Location location location. I’ve been trying to decide where I actually put my cafe. Originally my eyes were set on a limsa place as who doesn’t love a cafe by the beach. However with the weird teleport spots around the houses I’m not so sure anymore and a house near the center of the Ul Dah spa/swimming area looks very nice. I’ve yet to reach the housing area in heavenward yet have heard there is one yet so it’s tough for me to decide. 

3. Rp. I wanna make my cafe/tavern just a wholesome normal place with regular rp. None of the…other stuff as I know it exists yet have zero interest. I just wanna serve drinks and food happily. The problem is I have zero role playing knowledge in ff14 and don’t know where to start. I do have some role playing knowledge yet I’m worried it may be entirely different for this game. 

4. Spreading the message. While I should be playing on NA servers all my friends are on EU so I opted to instead join them in the Chaos server however I don’t know how active the roleplaying community for this server is nor how I would spread the word about my cafe/tavern when it’s finally been built so is there a place where you’re meant to advertise rp places?

5. Decoration. No one likes an empty cafe so imma need to decorate…but I don’t know where to get said decorations. I know you can customize the outside of your house to look like a cafe and would love to know how. And what types of furniture would always be helpful as I barely have touched any crafting classes besides culinary. 

6. Size! The plot of land itself. I’ve been back and forth whether to get a small or medium plot (no way am I going for large with how rare they show up and the cost). I would prefer a medium plot however getting the Gil would probably take a while…yet I fear if I got a small plot I wouldn’t really have the space for a good cafe. So I’m conflicted which size of plot I go for. 

7. Okay cafe or tavern? So I’ve been calling my one day project a cafe/tavern as I’ve yet to decide which of the two I would want to do. While a cafe was the heart of the idea I’ve heard that there’s only really maid/butler cafe’s in the game which isn’t what I wanna make. A tavern would let me avoid all the maid/butler stuff yet I like the fanciness of a cafe compared to a a more rough and gruff tavern, however it would offer more opportunities for the rp to be just adventures recounting their tales. So which would work better? 

Thank you anyone who responds with some answers as I’m still quite new to mmorpgs (still my first one only a month in) and don’t really understand most of the things but I wanna make this personal cafe/tavern a nice place for people to come sit down, have a chat, a cup of coffee or other beverage, some food, and enjoy themselves. As long as they leave with a smile that’s a good customer in my book! ",0,1729374323.0,ffxiv,5,0.5,False

A guy (25M) I was seeing for a month just told me he doesn’t want to commit to me. 

Context:

In the beginning, he told me he was a relationship type guy and we can see where this goes. 

I (23F) don’t waste my time with men that don’t put effort in. He was consistently putting effort in every week to make dates (I.e. nice dinner, coffee, etc), compliment me, and we were both very vulnerable with each other about things. 
His actions and words showed he was interested. I mean this man told me I could drive his car if I needed it one day for something (we live in a big city and I don’t have one). We also had multiple talks of what it would like if we were to be in a serious relationship. We had sex early on because physical chemistry was strong, but his behavior didn’t change after that or anything. 

It all shifted last week one night when he slept over and we had a hiking day trip planned for the following day. I guess he got upset because we played a question game and I challenged him on some of his answers. After that, he started acting distant and cold. I felt the entire energy shift. The next day as we drove to the hike a few hours away, he told me he was hurt by how I challenged him. I immediately apologized (was NOT my intention at all) and he accepted, and the energy felt somewhat back to normal but he still seemed a little distant and I kind of felt like I was now walking on eggshells (which it never felt like that before). After our hike later that day, he confessed to me that’s he’s not sure he wants to fully invest in our relationship, hanging out weekly is just a lot for him with his busy schedule. He also said he feels we’re different in a lot of ways but it literally felt like this energy came out of nowhere. He was cold, and not sweet like he normally was…

anyway, I told him that you make time for things you care about and it sounds like he’s just not that into me. He kept saying he just needed time to think and I said, okay you go do that and get back to me but I don’t like waiting around. So we drove back awkwardly in silence and took a couple of days apart. He finally messaged me asking to talk and share his thoughts with me and ultimately he said he doesn’t want to commit to me, doesn’t really see our relationship progressing, but is down to hangout for coffee / drinks (I’m sure he just means sex) every now and then. I said no to that and that was that. I don’t want to hangout with someone that can’t make time for me on my terms. I held my own, but I’m crushed because it literally felt like it was progressing toward a relationship and clearly he’s not that into me now. 

He’s obviously allowed to change his mind. But the way he went about it hurt (the fact that we were on a trip and he was so cold about it). I just don’t get how anyone’s feelings can change that fast. Maybe I gave him the ick or something idk. But I guess what I’m wondering is, how do I not take this personally? I want to be that girl he likes enough to commit to and the fact that I am not hurts. I’m now going through my head questioning everything I did. I really thought we had a great thing going (especially based on his actions) and the sudden switch up confused me. ",1,1729374106.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1g7jc0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentalimplant/comments/1g7jc0y/dental_implant_placed_too_deep/,Dental Implant Placed Too Deep?,"I have a long history with my front tooth, but here's a summary of my situation below:

* 10 years ago, I broke part of my front tooth on a glass bottle which resulted in me getting a crown on it. I didn't have any problems with my crown until the last few years or so it was puffy around the crown. My old dentist thought it was because my gum tissue didn't like the material of the crown. Fast forward to last November, I hit my front tooth down hard on a coffee cup and about 5 days later I started having insane pain. I went to see my new dentist and he said I needed a root canal right away but it was Friday evening so he put me on antibiotics over the weekend until my root canal appt with the endodontist on Monday morning. I got my root canal done and the pain stopped, but I still felt like something was off with my tooth when I tried to bite down on it. A few weeks go by and it's still the same, so I go back to the endodontist and he said he thinks it's my gums. When he flossed around my existing crown they started bleeding a lot. (But only on this tooth). So I went for a second opinion at another endodontist and he said it was my bite that was off and proceeded to adjust my crown 4-5x over 1.5 months. Well that didn't solve anything...
* So in March of this year I went to get a consultation with a periodontist after my dentist was pretty sure it was a vertical tooth fracture that wasn't showing up on the x-ray. The periodontist suggested my dentist to take off my old crown and wait 6 weeks to see if that was the problem, but at this point it had been 4 months and my gums were not happy and I was over with it. I decided to move forward with a dental implant instead.
* Finally, on April 3rd, I had my tooth removed and my dental implant placed during the same surgery. Now for the next 4 months of healing, I noticed my gums were not healing as quickly as I would have thought. But I sent a picture to the periodontist's office to double-check and they said the slow healing is normal. (They said they don't do follow-up appts and that was the best way to get my questions answered.)
* On July 30th, I had the healing abutment placed and my periodontist said my gums still looked irritated. He assumed it was the bone graph material still coming through.
* On September 17th, I had my first round of molds done, but the lab ended up saying the abutment piece that was provided wasn't going to be long enough and that I needed a custom abutment and that I'd need to redo my molds.
* On September 23rd, I had my second round of molds done, but my dentist noticed a lot of bone graph material still coming through so he reached out to my periodontist and he said to wait 3 more weeks before moving forward with the final tooth. The periodontist also wanted me to come in to do a gum scrub around my healing abutment because it looked irritated.
* On September 25th, I had the gum scrub done.
* On September 30th, I went to see my dentist because I noticed a bump on my gum. I had an infection... so he put me on antibiotics right away and said I needed to see my periodontist first thing in the morning. Morning came around and I walked into the periodontist office and discovered he was in Europe for 3 weeks, just my luck.

* On September 23rd, I had my second round of molds done, but my dentist noticed a lot of bone graph material still coming through so he reached out to my periodontist and he said to wait 3 more weeks before moving forward with the final tooth. The periodontist also wanted me to come in to do a gum scrub around my healing abutment because it looked irritated.
* On September 25th, I had the gum scrub done.
* On September 30th, I went to see my dentist because I noticed a bump on my gum. I had an infection... so he put me on antibiotics right away and said I needed to see my periodontist first thing in the morning. Morning came around and I walked into the periodontist office and discovered he was in Europe for 3 weeks, just my luck. I went back to my dentist's office and he called up a periodontist he works with often and he wanted me to come in right away. He removed the healing abutment, cleaned around the site and noticed an infection on the surface of my implant but it had not been affected yet. He put me on stronger antibiotics for 2 weeks and wanted to do a follow-up the following week. The next week he shared the results of my CT scan saying there was bone loss around the dental implant and also minor loss on my adjacent front tooth.
* Between October 9-14th we didn't have power in our city due to the hurricane. What horrible timing!
* On October 17th, I was finally able to my original periodontist who had placed the implant and he said everything looked good and I was good to go with the placement of my final tooth. But the thing is he never removed the healing abutment to look around. He said you can get infections from food getting stuck in the healing abutment. He also said the bone graft material was still coming through because he typically overpacks the site. He then showed me my original CT scan and said my bone was like that at the beginning of the process.

So now here I am utterly confused. My dentist is worried about how deep the dental implant was placed and it causing future problems. The questions I now have are: Why wasn't the tooth removed and then a bone graph done before starting the implant process? Could I have had periodontal disease from my 10-year-old crown and this caused a majority of my issues? And what are the long-term complications of having too deep of an implant?

If anyone has any insight to offer, please share. This has been a nightmare situation this last year and I could really use some advice!!

\*\*Please note on the x-ray image, what's not showing is the healing abutment which is translucent but it's screwed into the implant.

1g7j239,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1g7j239/fiancé_3_weeks_into_first_psychosis_episode/,Fiancé 3 weeks into first psychosis episode. ,"The doctors believe the episode was triggered by a medication for latent tuberculosis and Jesus Christ.. the first week was honestly the stuff from horror movies. 

I watched my happy level headed beautiful fiancé literally lose all her mental facilities practically overnight, I would wake up to her screaming and crying confused and frightened, she would go catatonic randomly for long periods of time , or I would see the look of complete horror on her face as she would hear entities telling her in her head they where coming for her. 

As the week went on she slipped into multiple different delusional states believing that she was trapped in a play.. or that something was inside of her because the house was haunted .. or she was stuck in a time loop. 

The first week she would NOT sleep at all. Maybe an hour a night, the second week they finally decided this wasn’t going to go away without medication so started her on apripiprozole. 

In the uk the crisis team like to treat at home as it’s less traumatic for the patient so I had myself signed off work and completely took over her care, they upped her dose this week so she’s been medicated for two weeks so far and although she isn’t out of it yet she is showing signs of improvement.. she’s much more clear headed most of the day now. She’s no longer catatonic although will zone out for a few seconds every now and again.
She still had parts of the day where she’s in delusion, however now it seems much less. 

We’ve started going out on walks this week and seeing friends and going for coffee dates to try and get her back out and about and for the most part she seems to be coping well and it’s looking like it’s doing her some good. 

She is still however hearing voices and having visual hallucinations, they just seem to be happening less. Night time seems to be the worst, we now sleep with the hallway light on and a night light, she used to be someone who had to sleep in pitch black dark, but guessing by the stuff she’s seen, I wouldn’t blame her. 
The last two days she managed around 5 hours sleep, doesn’t seem like much but compared to 1-2 hours I’m hoping this means things are starting to improve. 

I’m still sighed off of work to care for her and we have regular meetings with the team so they can keep tabs on how she’s doing but I guess I’m just looking to see from people who have been through it if things are looking up from your perspectives. 

The last two days she seems to be acknowledging around certain parts of the day that she’s been in and still in psychosis .. then she will sort of dip back out of it. 

I don’t endulge in her delusions, I just listen and try to be a calm voice. And to reassure her that she’s safe. And that nothing can hurt her even though it feels that way. A few times I even walked into her hallucinations that would be stood in the kitchen or peeping through the doorway to prove they couldn’t hurt me or anyone else , and when I did that they vanished. 

She told me today she can hardly remember the last few weeks thank god, the stuff I’ve see this week has been truly terrifying, and I’m not even the one going through it , I cannot even bare to imagine how frightening it’s been for her. 

We are due to get married next August. Is there a possibility we will have to cancel the wedding ? I want her to be well for it but she’s still shopping for wedding dresses and cakes ect, it would break her heart if I cancelled it.

1g7j22y,https://www.reddit.com/r/greatdanes/comments/1g7j22y/puppy_threw_up_after_eating_too_fast_but_acting/,Puppy threw up after eating too fast but acting super hungry now?,"I am 98% sure he threw up only because he ate too fast. I have a really good ceramic slow feeder bowl that he's eaten from with no issues, so I think he was just extra hungry this morning and really gobbled it down like a vaccum rather then chewing it like he usually does (he gets the royal canin giant puppy, hence, bigger pieces that he usually must chew). The other culprit is we ran out of his topper, so I increased the kibble to take it's place until we get some more.

Usually he gets 165g of kibble, with 20g of topper (they are instincts freeze dried ones, the skin support, joint support and gut health support). Total it is 185g per meal 3 times a day. Never has thrown up when the toppers are present, but he did have 185 of just kibble today and maybe the kibble takes up more space in his tummy and I shouldn't feed more kibble when the toppers are absent? I think from now on, though this hasn't happened before, I will give him a smaller meal in the morning too since he tends to eat faster then.

He is acting 100% fine otherwise. Is even trying to play with me! But he's also acting super hungry and keeps going and looking at the closet I keep his food in.

I know the suggestion is to fast for 12 hours after a vomit, but if I am almost positive it was eating too quickly, can I give him a small bit just to hold him over? I feel so bad that he's acting so hungry! I also usually give him a pupcicle when I go to work which will be in 2 hours. It contains just pumkin, an egg and a very tiny amount of blackberries I had left over that I smashed in there. I know the pumpkin is good but will the egg and blackberries be ok if his tummy is still sensitive? I am worried about him vomiting when I am gone, which is only 3 hours until my husband gets home.

Just some background, yes I have done tons of research on Dane diets and stuff but you know sometimes I just like to get opinions straight from the horses mouth! Ya'll have experience and own danes and have never led me astray. I could spend an hour just pouring over google results, or hear what you guys have done in this situation.

I know danes have super sensitve tummies, but my guy is lucky that he doesn't. The only other times he's thrown up is when he swallowed a bigger piece of a chew (I refrained from giving him chews after that unless they were in a holder, but now that he's older he chews everything pretty decently for the most part) and once after I gave him a coffee wood toy. He chewed it at night and when he woke up he threw up a couple very small bits despite that they are digestable. So I decided no more coffee wood after that either. (danes are so hard to buy chews for! good grief)

The only other thing that is different other then the toppers being absent is last night I gave him his first yak chew! But that was a full 16 hours ago and he had it before his final meal last night, which is fully digested since he only threw up the kibble from this morning and nothing else, so I don't think it could be that? He was around us for several hours after that and didn't show any signs of discomfort or tummy upset from it (nor did he break off any pieces or anything)

I do know the signs of bloat and he's not showing signs of any of that either. If he vomits again I'll just take him to the vet to be safe since I'm a worry-wort, but like I said, he is acting fine otherwise.

**Also, small disclaimer, just to keep unnessesary critiques from dropping. I feed royal canin giant puppy. I know the protien level is a bit higher then the suggested, but I have talked to several owners on here that feed it and have had great success, no joint issues into adulthood, etc. I have fed this food for months, no problems and it fixed his occasional wet poops he was having when he was on Hills Science large breed. My vet who is very savy with danes suggest it as well (and he doesn't even sell it, so it's not about money). He's had no issues eating this for months now, so I know his throwing up is not from allergies or anything like that. He had good bowel movements this morning as well. Please don't try to get me to switch his kibble! He's doing great on it.**

I’ve applied all over the country, for a a breadth of positions. I’ve only this week been offered an interview, and don’t expect to be employed anytime soon.

My first student loan payment is due this week. I have no money whatsoever, and am currently homeless. I opened a couple of credit cards while in school, and am lucky enough to have a pretty good credit score. I’m terrified of what missing this payment, and most likely several after is going to do to my credit score, and consequently ability to get an apartment, a car, etc. I grew up with a very poor family that struggled considerably due to bad credit. We couldn’t afford most apartments, and many of those that we couldn’t afford we couldn’t move into because of my parent’s credit scores.

I don’t know what to do. I can’t get a job *anywhere*. I’ve applied to all of the local grocery stores, all of the local coffee shops and fast food restaurants, and even a minimum wage $7.25 an hour job working at a car wash.

### Devotional: Set Apart: Embracing the Journey of Sanctification

**Scripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24 (NIV)**

“May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.”

- - - - - -

**Reflect:**

As believers, we are called to be set apart—to live differently, to reflect the light of Christ in our actions and attitudes. This journey of sanctification is not merely a destination but a transformative process that unfolds throughout our lives. Each day presents us with opportunities to grow closer to God and to become more like Him.

In a world that often celebrates conformity to worldly standards, the call to sanctification encourages us to embrace our uniqueness as children of God. We are not defined by the noise around us but by the quiet assurance of His presence within us. This journey may come with challenges, but it is also filled with profound joys and divine revelations.

- - - - - -

**Pray:**

Heavenly Father, thank You for choosing me and setting me apart for Your purpose. Help me to embrace the journey of sanctification, knowing that You are with me every step of the way. When I face trials or feel overwhelmed by my shortcomings, remind me that Your grace is sufficient, and that Your power is made perfect in my weakness. Give me the courage and strength to grow and become more like You. Amen.

- - - - - -

**Encourage:**

**1. Celebrate Small Victories:** Sanctification is a gradual process. Don’t overlook the small victories in your spiritual journey. Each moment of patience, each act of kindness, and each decision to seek God are steps forward. Celebrate these milestones and watch them accumulate into significant change.

**2. Seek His Presence:** Embrace everyday moments—whether during prayer or while sipping your morning coffee—as opportunities to connect with God. Surrender your day to Him and ask for guidance in your thoughts and actions. It’s in seeking His presence that we find clarity and strength for the road ahead.

**3. Embrace Community:** Surround yourself with fellow believers who encourage and uplift you on this journey. Sharing your struggles and victories can help you gain perspective and support. Remember, you are part of a family that is also on their journey of sanctification.

**4. Trust in His Faithfulness:** As Paul reminds us, “The one who calls you is faithful.” His promises are unwavering; trust that He is actively working in your life to mold you into His image. When times are tough, hold tight to the truth that He is doing a work in you that will be revealed in His perfect timing.

- - - - - -

**Journal Prompt:**

- Reflect on areas where you feel God is calling you to grow. Write down specific steps you can take to respond to His prompting. How can you be more intentional about your sanctification journey this week?

- - - - - -

**Closing Thought:**

Remember, sanctification is not about perfection; it’s about progression. Each day, as you seek Him and desire to grow, you are being transformed from glory to glory. Celebrate the journey, trust His timing, and embrace the beautiful work He is doing in you. You are set apart for a purpose, and He is faithful to complete the work He has begun in you.

1g7iutw,https://i.redd.it/3i4r9m614svd1.jpeg,"My recent journey to Cancun, Mexico. Part 1. ","I was always a hat wearer. As a kid growing up in the 90’s in Australia, if you weren’t supporting an American major sport team, you just weren’t cool. 
I remember getting a deal on a St Louis Cardinals hat. I had to ask someone who the team was and then physically find it on a map of the US. 
I had expert geographical knowledge of the US cities (at least those with major teams) by the time I was 14. Places like Dallas (the Cowboys had the best cheerleaders) and Chicago (I hope you don’t have to ask why.. Pippen of course) were magical places, on the verge of reality and where dreams came from. 
Alas, we were poor, so my hat choices came down to the ones I were given, those on supersale or some I ‘found’. St Louis being one of the most memorable, cause no one had a clue who they were so I got some street cred. 

I just never really grew out of hats. My hair was a bit scruffy, I never really got it cut well and I preferred the way I looked sporting a cap. I would go to work and nicer places without one, but any chance I got, there would be my trusty hat. I also expanded the brands and logos I chose. Now I was grown up, and had a hat for every occasion. 

I often heard the saying ‘you’ll go bald if you wear a hat all the time.’

Well, I went bald anyway. All the men in my family had somewhat shiny domes, and my dad sported his well, being about Norwood 5 (Norwood is the international balding scale, where 1 is still a good head of hair and 7 is a bald as it gets.) So I knew I was destined for a life in the slick lane. 

But going barren on the noggin didn’t happen quickly. It was a slow increase in forehead length, starting around the age of 27. I distinctly remember a girl at a bar see me take my hat off and say something like, ‘maybe leave that forehead under there’. 
Of course, she was an awful person and I give her little thought, other than it being the serious start of my hairline decline. I just took further security under my hat and tried to take it off less. 

Around this time I moved to Canada to become a snowboard and ski instructor. This was even better for my receding hairline, I could now wear a toque (beanie) or helmet for half of the year. 

I then met someone who I ended up marrying so my hairline woes drifted to a low shelf in my mind filed under ‘concerns i no longer need to have’. 
I still covered my depleted bean as much as possible but I guess we’re more comfortable with our aesthetic shortcomings when we’re in love. 

Fast forward nearly 15 years, a beautiful daughter and an amicable separation later, I find some old shitty buried self doubts creeping in. Not even understandable self doubts really, more just a straight up desire never to be seen without something on my head. It was black or white. 

Something on my head? Yep. Let the good times role! 

I gotta go bald? Yep. Where can I stand where the least number of people will see me. 

I was hyper aware of people seeing my bald head and now being single after so long, it became a major hurdle to overcome. I did my best to rock it when needed, and my head shape isn’t terrible, but let’s face it, no one ever said ‘I wish I was bald.’

So eventually a FB or insta ad caught my attention. They were almost too good to be true. From businesses in Turkey and then Cancun. 
Would you believe it? I could go for a holiday in the sun and come back with better hair than I’d had in 20 years. And it would be for less than half the cost of a similar procedure in Canada. 

I likened it to those ads from Temu that promise this amazing tool I’ve wanted for ages, for about 20% of the usual cost. 
Sure, I’ll get those $10 2 ton jack stands. I’ll be saving myself heaps of money when I take those bald winter tires off in spring. What could go wrong?

But as I dove into the black hole of hair transplants on the net, I discovered some interesting things. 

Hair transplants had come a long way. My only experience with them was the occasional celebrity news in some trashy media, or a direct reference to Donald Trump. I don’t even know if he actually had one but I’d see his floppy red minge and think ‘if a billionaire can only achieve this, what chance do I have living as a professional ski bum in Whistler?’.

Finasteride (propecia) was the drug Trump was on, so it then became known to me as the ‘Trump drug’ that gave nasty side effects, including mental issues. I mean, now he has an excuse right? 

Apart from being really expensive at the time, Finasteride* clearly didn’t even work, unless you were happy with a wispy birds nest that would never get thick enough to block the rays of light bouncing off your pasty dome. 
I also assumed Trump must have tried any cutting edge techniques available to a billionaire, with similarly poor success. 

*To give Finasteride credit, I never thoroughly researched the medication. By this stage (at 44) I was beyond the help of meds and certainly wasn’t considering turning into a Trump. I now see there are benefits and know this is a great solution for many people. The side effects aren’t as bad as I assumed and there’s a topical version if you don’t want to take a pill. 

There are many suggestions to use both Finasteride and Minoxidil before and after a hair transplant. Many people will have been using these meds for many years prior to getting a hair transplant. Every persons needs and conditions are different and the decision to use meds or not is a personal one to be discussed with your Doctor. 

As I looked further into the online world of hair transplants, it seemed that in Turkey, for years, (and more recently in Mexico) people had been defying the God of Glabrate and achieving permanent hair restoration. And it was their own hair, off their own heads. 
Apparently a good hair taken from the back of my head and stuck in the top of my head will stay there. Forever! Who knew?

And I was a great candidate. I had what was called a good donor area. The area and density of the hair on the back and sides of the head, where my new hair will be harvested from, was good on both counts. 

Istanbul was sometimes featured in an Indiana Jones or James Bond movie. Is this where they discovered the fountain of youth? Maybe just the fountain that bald guys get to use. 
I mean, why not? Out of all human aging traits, balding must be the most sustained, unavoidable and random one, and we eggheads deserved the cure most. 

Any man that has lost his hair knows the feeling. Acceptance comes to most eventually, and if you’re lucky to have a decent shaped skull or a partner who loves you for what’s on the inside, it may never bother you. 
But for some, including me, feeling bummed about it was common. Even if it was only wanting to wear my hat to a fancy dinner to avoid the reflections off the pate. 

The idea of getting a transplant was taking hold and I started to think about the justification of doing it. 
A whole load of new thoughts surged forward. If I could get a transplant (and it actually worked), how would people react? I would have to tell my family and although we all get along really well, I already dreaded the moment I’d see their incredulous reaction. 
At least one of my sisters would surely think it was a prank. My Dad would get that expression on his face I know all too well. A cross between shock and confusion. Head down, eyebrows up. (Love you dad). 
I would have to explain to them the why, how, when, etc etc on a zoom call with up to 6 people (I have 4 sisters). 
I would have to be ready to see the reactions of people I’d known for years and deal with potentially awkward moments or sit through the same old questions. 

I was also hoping that the fact I wore a toque or hat for 95% of my time outdoors meant people wouldn’t be as surprised seeing me with decent hair. 

Was I too old to bother? People will think I’m vain and they’ll gossip about ‘joel getting a hair transplant’. Will I just keep wearing a hat so people won’t see I got it done? How will I explain this to my 10 year old daughter? That was a big one. 

Then I thought about other cosmetic procedures people do all the time and considered dental work. 
No one wants nasty chompers. Crooked or missing teeth, stained teeth from smoking and drinking coffee and of course decay, are all things we fix if we have the means. 
Absolutely no body on earth with a serious tooth issue has ever said ‘thanks, I’d prefer to leave it nasty’. Regardless of whether it is a medical requirement or for aesthetic reasons, if you can fix your teeth, you will. 

The best dental comparison for me, is getting your front teeth knocked out, which I also got to experience, so I’m 2 for 2 right now.

I was happy with my smile, cause I’ve got decent, straight teeth and never really thought about it cause they looked good. 

Then boom, one night I was powering a peddle bike home after drinking at university (cause I could have driven my car but this was the safest option..), to find myself suddenly dead stopped behind a parked vehicle. 
I’d been so focussed on pushing as fast as possible, I hadn’t look up to see the back of the Ute. They’re basically lowered trucks in Oz. My face hit the top of the tray. 

So I lost 2 front teeth. My nose and subsequent emergency surgery is another story, but even after the bruises had gone lighter yellow my teeth still weren’t fixed. 
It was the worst time of my youth. 

I wouldn’t open my mouth if I could avoid it and I started to talk in a way where my upper lip would cover my teeth. Just like I had peanut butter stuck up there. Or a big piece of tobacco chew. Just sitting there. 
My laughs would be open mouth and expressionless, as when I smiled with my eyes, I would expose my teeth. Try laughing without exposing your front teeth. You see?
If I couldn’t help myself I would turn away or put my hand in front of my mouth. 

I would wait for peoples eyes to flick to my funky teeth. The slow pause as they decided (some much quicker than others) what to say next. 
If I knew them already, they would often show some concern and ask what happened and am I alright and did it hurt and how much to fix omg. If I didn’t know them, 100% of the time there was this awkward moment. 

I began playing social experiments to see if I could get a certain reaction from someone, adjusting the cause of my missing teeth for the emotion I was hunting for. Pity, amazement or just grossed out. Funny enough, the real story of my aftermath got the best gross-out response. I just changed the bit about what came in contact with my face and how. 
Or when I met someone, I would bet with myself the time it would take for them to ask. 
Or how much more awkward I could make the situation by pretending I had lost my teeth years ago and I just didn’t feel that how I looked should determine how people see me (my favourite), then watch them back-peddle to say it’s hardly noticeable after bringing it up in the first 15 seconds of meeting me. Yep, super awkward. 

But here is the comparison with going bald.

Having no hair and missing a front tooth are both really noticeable and something I wanted to hide. 
In terms of distinguishing facial features, they have to be close to having eyes that look in different directions. You just can’t un-see it and it will for ever be a defining part of your description, political correctness be damned. 

Also, I feel like my teeth were TAKEN from me. Kind of like my hair, just over a much shorter time period. And I didn’t like the way I looked without either. I would prefer to have good teeth and hair on my head. 

I did nothing wrong. Well, I could have been less drunk, and maybe been watching where I was going, but I should have my regular teeth and look my regular way. I didn’t lose my hair for any reason other than having the genes of a bald man. Just like when someone inherits 3 rows of shark teeth from a similarly sharky parent. And guess what - both are easily fixable!

Is someone ever criticized for getting bad teeth improved? Why would critical thinking apply to a hair transplant? It clearly shouldn’t and yet, Im quite certain I will see responses from people that don’t align with this idea. 

I was lucky I only smashed out 2 teeth and that getting them fixed was a fairly simple process, it just took some time for my mouth to heal, then get a temporary crown while they made the permanent one. Goodbye awkward social moments

As I thought this out, the other cool thing I noticed was what happened to my confidence and self esteem. I knew a new head of hair would boost my self esteem for sure, but it was happening already, before I’ve even made the decision to get it done. 

I asked myself why I was going to do this and the answer was always; for me. 

Sure, if it would make me more attractive to women and I would no longer be seen by others as ‘the bald guy’ I would be stoked. But that’s not why I’m doing it. 
I’m doing it because I have a chance to regain something I used to have that will improve the way I look (just like fixing a tooth) and I will feel comfortable around people without the need for a hat. I won’t want to hide. I’ll enjoy once more the pleasure of washing, cutting (by someone else!) and styling hair on top of my head. I’ll be happier and more confident. I’m doing this for me. 

Then it hit me. That in doing this for myself, I am justifying (okay, maybe over justifying a little) all I need, to the person that matters most, which is me. Therefore, I should pay no attention to what other people may or may not say about it. It doesn’t matter. 
More than likely they’re not even thinking about me and the people I really care about will no doubt be supportive and understand. The others don’t matter. 

My ability to let go of the worry I had about the reactions of people I don’t know, was the final step for me. It was like a lightbulb. 

I decided to get the hair transplant done and I clung to these realizations whenever I felt doubt. 
And really, what could be the worst thing to happen? I could only have SOME success, which means I would get some hair, which by most accounts is still better than none.

I decided to tell absolutely no one I was getting it done. This may be impossible for some. I was lucky with the procedure happening during the quietest month of my year, as I work seasonally, and most family live on the other side of the world. 
I made up a basic story of treating myself to a kiteboarding trip to Cancun with a vague friend who may or may not be coming. 

I didn’t want to put any more pressure on myself than I had to. Doing this alone was enough and anyone planting even the slightest doubt may cause me to back out. 
Not telling my daughter was the hardest. I made an effort to never actually tell a lie, even to ‘bringing something back with me’ when I couldn’t see her for a few days after getting back. But I stumbled and lied when asked directly about my friend who was there. So Brett, you got really sun burned and suck at kiteboarding. 

The other reason I told no one is because I could back out at any time. If I didn’t get it done, well, I’d just have a kiteboarding trip to Cancun and no one would know I chickened out.  

The research.

There appears to be new methods coming out of Turkey (the fountain of youth is flowing west) and making its way to Cancun, Mexico. DHI is the new way to implant hair follicles that appear to come from Turkey. Actually, this tech has been around since 1992 and was invented by a South Korean named Choi, hence the Choi pen, which is the specific tool used to create an incision and implant the hair follicle at the same time, called DHI. 
This is a superior method to implant hairs over FUE, which still seems to be the standard in most developed nations. This is the process where small individual incisions are made first and then a graft is placed inside the hole crated. 

With the DHI method, a higher number of grafts can be implanted in one session, with a higher success rate using the Choi pen, as it skips a time consuming step, reduces the handling of the grafts to be implanted and creates a better little slot for the graft to take hold. 
DHI is the method that a few of these Cancun based clinics are using, complete with Turkish staff. 

There has also been big strides made in the area of stem cells, in this case called PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) treatment. Stem cells assist in recovery and there is strong encouragement to use it after a hair transplant. The guys in Turkey, and now Cancun, seem to also be on this, and will encourage you to get the shots. As I do. 

At time of writing, I’m seeing some new ads claiming an increase of 2000 grafts per procedure thanks to the use of stem cells. These are coming only from Turkey, not Mexico at this stage, so I can’t confirm the claim.

I do some basic inquiring via WhatsApp to one of the bigger hair clinics in Cancun. 
 
Everything feels just a little sketchy. Communication is via WhatsApp only, with a link to their website. The searches online show some instagram ads with a Turkish man explaining the superiority of DHI in Cancun, whilst standing in front of a basic wall map with simple arrows pointed at Turkey and Cancun. 
There are a few guys who’ve just had the procedure done talking about their great experience, but how can either of us judge how good their hair will be in a year from now?
And who can believe the before and after pics? With good lighting and photoshop and now bloody AI, I’ll never believe another internet picture without fact checking. 

As I dig deeper, I find positive Google reviews and Reddit chats that not only confirm the legitimacy of this company in Cancun, but heap praise for changing their lives. 
It’s worth noting that Cancun still isn’t regarded as the best place to get a hair transplant. Most Reddit forums will praise Turkey over Cancun, as well as the use of specific doctors over the big clinics. I found zero reviews on Reddit about the clinic I eventually went with. 

So we message a bit and the response time is okay. They seem happy to help. They ask for some pics of my skull, front, side and back and take a couple days to get back to me. 

My initial feeling wasn’t good. Early in the reply, I see ‘Your balding is quite bad’. I know it is. Thanks for pointing that out. 

‘But we can help’, they tell me. 

Approximately 4000 grafts is the limit for one hair transplant. If you have a good amount of space to cover (your balding is quite bad) you have to work with this number. This is because you don’t want to overharvest the donor area on the back and sides of the head. 4500 may be possible if you have a larger head and a great donor area. Likewise, if you don’t have a dense or large donor area, you may not want to push 4000, and most places simply won’t, or so you’d hope. 
I’ve also heard in some cases that clinics will turn customers away due to insufficient hair in donor areas. If you’re told you don’t have a good donor area, be very wary of places telling you they’ll get thousands of grafts. Sometimes you just don’t have enough for a hair transplant and you are truly a bald man forever.

I considered myself quite bald. I rated myself at a Norwood 6. But before my trip to Mexico I let it grow for the first time in 15 years and happily discovered I was more a Norwood 5, close to how I was on my wedding day, around 15 years ago. 
I got married, I kinda had hair in the wedding day photos, but it was a relief to never care about my hairline again. I just used clippers to a zero once a week after that. 

Anyway, I was still realistic with my expectations. My balding was quite bad apparently. I would never be cured of my baldness with one magical visit. 

The initial bummed feeling was replaced with slight hope when I was informed they could do ‘up to’ 4500 grafts and concentrate on the front of my head and proceed back as far as possible. But because ‘I was so bald’, I could wait a year and then go back and get the rest completed, using another 2500 grafts or so.

The little shiny seed was planted. 

I finally got a cost out of them. They would have done themselves a favour by just giving me the price. Every emoji they used in their message was a red flag. And they used way too many. It was ‘on sale’, now only, free accommodation, some stupid emoji. Omg. 

Finally, $3,500 USD for the first 4500 grafts (up to). And I’d get $200 off if I organized my own accommodation. They just need to see a screenshot of the flight confirmation and someone would be there to pick me up. No $ before then. They take USD cash. Yeah they also take Credit Card. Great, I’ll get the points too. Oh, you charge 10% extra to use it? Guess it’ll be cash then. 

Was I doing a deal directly with a Mexican cartel? Indirectly, I’d argue most transactions in Mexico are, one way or another. 

I said thanks and I’d think about it and I did nothing for a couple months. I continued to hide my head. I did more research. 

Then I guy I knew got a hair transplant. And he looked amazing! Almost unrecognizable. He was much younger than me, and only got his hairline corrected, as he still had decent coverage on top and minor loss on the crown. He got it done in his home country of Spain. I think it was all FUE method and what he paid was double the cost for what he would get in Mexico. 
Did I mention how good he looked? Well, he was happy too. He couldn’t keep the smile off his face when I grilled him about it. 

There’s valid argument suggesting medical procedures conducted in less developed countries could yield poorer results due to a less regulated industry. I would suggest doing your own in-depth research before committing to a particular clinic. I hope my story can assist you in that research. 

There’s also a good argument that less regulation and overhead costs allow certain businesses to pass on these savings to the customer. Breast implants in Brazil, teeth Veneers in Costa Rica, Hair Transplants in Turkey. If the end result is the same, why not go get it for half the price. You can even get a holiday at the same time! 

And let’s be honest, a hair transplant is a fairly simple procedure. If I were looking to get my teeth or breasts fixed in another country, it would require much greater consideration and research than doing a hair transplant in Mexico. 
It’s pretty much the same as getting 8000 injections on your head. If the place is clean and the person knows what they’re doing, the most serious risks are eliminated. 
I certainly won’t end up with any of the serious complications that can arise from bad dental work or a sub-par breast augmentation. 

My other thoughts about this focus on practitioner performance. I never actually verified the credentials of the person doing my procedure, so my doctor could have just been an experienced technician. 
It’s more comforting to know the procedure is being done by a Doctor, but if the technician has done the procedure 100 more times, there’s a very good chance they’re better at it than the 70yr old doc with shaky hands who has 4 medical degrees but has only done 3 hair transplants. 
How many hair transplants has your doctor actually done? 

I’m a firm believer that practice makes perfect and if I have to get a mechanic to work on my car, I want the best mechanic possible please. 
The one who could do the job blindfolded because they have done it so many times. Who knows just by looking (sometimes just by hearing) what is wrong and is honest enough to tell me whether it’s worth fixing. 
I don’t really care if they went to the Harvard of Auto Mechanics to be honest. 

These guys in Cancun have some good numbers. Sure, the last thing I want to be is just another number in a long line. But they also get good numbers because they have good staff who can do the job efficiently. 
This also applies to the technicians working next to the doctor. If they’re really good at loading the Choi pen whilst assisting the doctor implanting, then the doctor is going to deliver more grafts safely. 
And they want happy customers right? No point in pumping out good numbers for 2 weeks only to have major complaints, issues and legal trouble, forcing them to close their doors. 
I just couldn’t find that many legitimate, horror story, ‘never go there’ comments on the internet. And I didn’t just google ‘bad hair transplant reviews’ once. I spent over a year looking. 

Then I found a website for a Vancouver based health and wellness company. They covered a few areas including PRP treatments, and how beneficial they are after Hair Transplants. They listed the option for a free hair consultation so I signed up. 
During our consultation, I discovered they used HairInMexico and acted as a mediary between the company and Canadians, offering peace of mind and follow up medical requirements back in Canada. 

There aren’t really any follow up requirements, unless you opt in for more PRP treatments or have complications like infection, hence I discovered that pushing these PRP treatments was the main benefit for this Canadian company, as well as the money they made on the fee for the transplant itself.  
They quoted me at least $3000 CAD more than the $3800 USD I could get by going directly to the company. The PRP treatments would be an additional cost at $900 CAD per shot, with the recommendation to get at least 4.
I guess they’re a business too, they offer a good service if you need it. 

This gave me confidence. If a Canadian company was willing to act as an agent and send their own clients to Mexico for a hair transplant, then they must have vetted the company right? 

Then I went directly to HairInMexico. 

Very similar to my inquiry with the other Cancun based business, it was on WhatsApp, I sent pictures of my head and received a response almost identical to the other, with the pleasant use of less emojis and without the obvious ‘you are very bald’ statements. 

The number of grafts would be the same (max 4500 if possible on first visit). The cost was $300 USD more, but I also wasn’t given any ‘on sale now’ pitch. They would also deduct $300 USD if I didn’t use their provided hotel. 
They also offer a guarantee. I never investigated this closely, but understood later it applies to transplanted grafts not taking correctly or some other issue out of your control. It wouldn’t apply to poor transplant results due to lack of donor area or thin donor hair. This is why having correct expectations is important. 
Nor would the guarantee apply to damage caused if you roll onto it while sleeping post op. 

The response time was better and I felt a more personal approach from Carmelita. She would even send voice messages to clarify points, so actually hearing a voice, in clear English, built even more confidence. 

There will come a time when commitment is required, and it will be scary. Some people may take more time than I with research and ask more questions. I didn’t feel I had more to investigate.  ",2,1729372400.0,HairTransplants,6,0.58,False

My fiancé it at his last rope with me.  I think he's only staying with me now because he knows without him, I'd be destitute. 

I don't have family I can go with, and I don't have a well paying job. I only bring home $200-$300 a week, I work part time because I'm in college full time. Our rent is $1050. 

He makes $5k a month and other than bills I spend it. I can't stop. And every time I try to stop, I relapse again and spend like $2000 a month. 

I can't stop feeling like I constantly need stuff. The instant gratification of next day shipping from Amazon and online shopping has fueled this. I feel like I am always restocking items I need. It just never ends. 

I also have an addiction to going and getting coffee before I do anything. I just like the feeling of getting it. I do make my own at home. 

We are $5000 in credit card debt right now and basically completely broke. My fiance only gets paid 1x a month. I'm also in school full time, and though my job pays for half of it, I have to pay out of pocket for the other half and we have nothing saved for it because I keep blowing through all our money.  

It's stressing my fiancé out to where I know he wants to leave, but feels he can't. And I don't want to be in a relationship with someone who's only with me because they feel bad for me. He wants me to change and stop so badly but I can't. 

We've tried everything. I am financially abusive. I will use his cards from his wallet because I have to scratch that urge. I'm also financially abusive on myself. I have poor credit and no savings. 

It's not like I even buy expensive things but I'm addicted to buying vintage clothes on shops like Depop or EBay because they're unique pieces and if someone buys it before me I genuinely get very upset. And I do love fashion and dressing up. I only shop second hand or from local boutiques, and I never shop fast fashion. 

I think in part of this is ADHD and anxiety too. I'm always wanting to try new hobbies which require me spending on something. Or, I'll get bouts of anxiety about the future so I'll drop $200 on books and seeds for doomsday. 

I struggle with an addictive personality. I have struggled with anorexia, cocaine addiction, caffeine, alcohol, benzos. But shopping (and anorexia) is the one thing I cannot stop. 

It's getting to the point where I don't want to live anymore because I can't stop being like this. It's been 2 years with my partner and he's fed up. He's miserable. I've destroyed my relationship and my financial health because of this. I don't want to live in general because I hate living in capitalism. I hate money. I hate having to make it, I hate having to spend it. I'm mentally unwell and I don't think I can ever change. I will at some point be left destitute and at that point I'll just end it. I came from poverty so I never had a chance anyways. 

Please help, I'll take any advice. I need out of this. I want to change I want to be better. I feel dirty when I spend and have a bunch of Amazon packages, and I feel clean when I don't spend for a while, but I always relapse. I just want to be normal.

I am in the process of a major remodeling of my home (move some walls, adding square footage etc). Now I have an open kitchen floor. And had some coarse cabinet design (especially appliance and sinks) such that we can decide where to put window, plumbing, gas, etc. I need advices on whether the current design makes sense. Thank you!

  
Additional info:

Kitchen + family room size: \~27\*30 ft

Kitchen size: 20ft 9inch \* 15ft

Roof type: vaulted ceiling with 11ft at highest point, 8ft at lowest point

Original floorplan provided by architect: [https://imgur.com/Pl0NwHZ](https://imgur.com/Pl0NwHZ)

  
Personal preference on the current design:

Sink must face window

Want a coffee bar (hence a 2nd sink in the corner)

Nothing on top of island

Want built-in trash cans

I feel bad reaching out because I should be thankful these are the only side effects I have consistently and that's why I've been hesitant to. But it's at a point now that's it's impacting my life. I basically lose an entire day of the week. I can barely get off the couch and sleep on and off all day Saturday. I used to take my shot Friday night before bed but I've moved it earlier and earlier in hopes that some of my Saturday could be saved. Now I'm taking it at work Friday around 10am. If I do it earlier I struggle through the end of my work day. 


For some context why losing Saturday is a huge problem for me now. My full time job is year round Monday-Friday.  But I work as a college professor for a second job and I'm also getting my doctorate. Classes started back up again for both in September and since my full time job, teaching at night, and my own classes I'm attending take place during the week... Saturday and Sunday are the only days I can grade papers and focus on my own school work. Losing an entire day for the past month and a half has put me so far behind I'm stressing out about being able to catch up with all the work I have to do. 


I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to approach these side effects. I am on Adderall for my ADHD, so stimulants don't have the same effect on me as most people. I can't drink some coffee or an energy drink and just perk up, I just fall back asleep. I've tried stretching as soon as I wake up and light exercise. I walk my dog every morning. I just end up back on the couch sleeping again. For the headache I've tried most over the counter remedies like Advil, Aleve, Tylenol, different migraine brands, tension headache brands, essential oils, ice, heat, massage. They barely touch the pain I'm in. I drink plenty of water throughout the week and replenish electrolytes.  I'm just at a loss here. If anyone has any advice I would appreciate it so much.

1g7ikzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1g7ikzs/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

I am currently developing a game titled '***Mysteries of the Twos***.' This is a mystery/otome visual novel !

**The game is divided into 5 parts** *(prologue included, and by parts I mean that each part is a visual novel, to progress through the story you'll need to play each part in order !),* and so far, the prologue and the first part named *« Mysterious Encounters »* are available to download (l*inks after the summary!*)

Here’s a brief summary of the plot :

You wake up in a room you don’t recognize. Both the door and the window are locked, and **there’s no way to communicate with the outside world or to understand what happened to you.** The scene quickly makes you realize that..

# You have been kidnapped under mysterious circumstances.

The only clue you have in this room is a letter left on the coffee table, seemingly written by your **'Kidnapper**'.

But don't worry...he doesn't plan to keep you locked up in this room forever...

Actually, he has a clear plan in mind :

# He wants you to attend Sakuragami Akademi High School, where he personally enrolled you and claims to be a student as well.

The problem?

You don’t remember anything—neither your name, your identity, nor your life before waking up in this mysterious room. **You don't know and you have no idea who could be your kidnapper, his motives and objectives are also unknown to you.**

Deprived of your memories, your life, your family and most of all... your identity, **you must discover your kidnapper's identity, his motives, his links with you, and your links with all the mysteries to be able to discover who you really are**.

So what are you going to do ?

*Are you going to obey the kidnapper and do exactly what he says ?*

*Or are you going to warn the authorities and try to escape him?*

*Will you find the truth behind your captivity ?*

*Will you succeed in freeing yourself?*

***Will you break all the mysteries?***

The solution of all the mysteries is waiting for you to be revealed.

# If you're interested, you can check the prologue's page here :

# After you've played the prologue, you can check the first part of the game :

1g7iiva,https://www.reddit.com/r/MonarchMoney/comments/1g7iiva/how_i_use_and_love_monarch/,How I Use (and love) Monarch,"Howdy y'all,

I jumped on the Monarch train after the Mint debacle last year and I'll be staying on for the foreseeable future. At that time I was looking for an app that (1) fit nicely into my own financial model (fixed costs / savings / investments / guilt free spending, a la Ramit Sethi) and (2) easily synced with my accounts (Fidelity...). I cycled through almost every finance app out there with a few exceptions, and nothing was really accomplishing my goals; most were missing the mark on both goals.

At first, Monarch wasn't set up to mirror that system. I learned I could bucket spending categories, rename those categories to match my financial model (fixed costs / guilt free spending), but it didn't work great. I still needed to budget by overarching category (called Groups by Monarch) rather than subcategory to accomplish having a Guilt Free Spending bucket. I also didn't have a solution for savings / \[post tax\] investing.

Then with the help of another Redditor on this sub I learned ""Budget by Group"" (gear icon immediately to the right of the budget group's name on the web version). I was able to itemize all my recurring month expenses (rent, insurance, groceries, gas, etc.) in the classic fashion. Then I was finally able to dump every other category in my Guilt Free Spending bucket, not assign values to things like 'taxi' or 'coffee' or whatever and simply dump the rest of my budget into that category. I used Monarch's Goals as placeholders for my own monthly savings and investing goals.

The biggest win is that when I'm asked to go to dinner, want to buy a coffee, buy a pair of shoes, go on a nice date, etc., I can open up the app, look at my budget and immediately see ""$327 left in Guilt Free Spending"", knowing that I'm not overspending on anything else and my life is otherwise taken care of.

The other bells and whistles aren't bad either. With oodles of student loan debt it's nice to watch my net worth grow over time. I love the Sankey diagrams more than anybody would ever like to admit. The app is visually appealing and nice to look at. I've overall been delighted with the investment of time and money.

The program has some quirks yet and obviously has room to grow. The goals themselves could be much better laid out. There should be a better way to account for anticipated large purchases (vacations, down payments, car emergencies, etc.). It would be awesome if the budget lines were added for groups in the app, rather than just categories. If I could have a simple widget on my Home Screen identifying my guilt free spending category...I would be insanely excited..........

Overall this app helps me visualize my system in a really meaningful way and helps me know within 10 seconds that no, I should no feel guilty buying a new shirt, my immediate and long term financial life is taken care of and I have money left to spend. And to me, that feeling is worth the annual fee.

Great product, Monarch team!

Edit: attempted way too much to add last month's Sankey diagram as a great visual for how my system is set up, but I am apparently Reddit illiterate and can't get it on there.

Edit 2: Jk\^

1g7iine,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1g7iine/queer_disabled_san_diegan_considering_moving_to_a/,"Queer, disabled San Diegan considering moving to a medium sized midwest college town for a car-free life in 15-20 years. ","Hi, I've been considering in maybe about 15 or so years moving out of California (San Diego) back to the midwest. I lived in Omaha, Nebraska til I was 9 but then my mom got a well-paying software developer job and decided to move out to California and drag me along. I've lived in various different spots in San Diego county (including Imperial Beach, La Jolla, Rancho Bernardo, El Cajon, Ramona and Escondido). Here's some things about me:

-I'm currently 35 years old. I am disabled and queer (More specifically I have autism, ADHD and identify as aromantic asexual. Also, I'm biologically male with a non-binary gender identity).

-I live in a group home for disabled adults. I'm very independent and able to go out on my own to relax at the library or coffee shops and the only time I'm required to tag along with the group home is when going to my doctor/dentist appointments or if the group home decides to take a road trip to another state.

-I likely wouldn't move back to Omaha given its poor public transit and the fact that it's in a red state and probably doesn't have the best disability services.

-I don't drive at all or have a driver's license for a variety of reasons. For one, cars are expensive and I struggle with anxiety issues and carsickness. I also don't ride bikes as I have poor balancing skills. My main methods of getting around are by walking or taking the bus (I pretty much never get motion sick on the bus). Where I live in San Diego, the nearest bus stop is like a half hour walk from my house. 

-That being said, I'm currently looking into medium sized college towns in the midwest like Champaign/Urbana IL, Bloomington/Normal IL, Ames IA, Lawrence KS, Ann Arbor MI and Madison WI. While I likely won't be enrolling because I've gotten burned by student loan debt before, the fact that they all have great bus systems appeals to me. I'm leaning towards the Illinois cities considering Ames and Lawrence aren't really close to any major airports/are in pretty conservative states and Ann Arbor and Madison are really expensive from what I've heard.

-Yes, I know Chicago exists but it seems like a place that would get really easy to get lost in (also its more expensive than the college towns). Besides, Champaign/Urbana has an Amtrak train that goes to the Chicago airport in case I want to take an international flight. 

-I honestly don't really care about going on hiking/camping trips and stuff. I'm a much more indoorsy person who would rather play video games or engage in other geeky hobbies. I'm also not a big sports person and don't drink any alcohol, not for religious reasons (I'm agnostic) but for mental health ones (also, I can't stand the fermented smell/taste of it). 

-I'm considering renting instead of buying, likely with a roommate to help me out and split the cost. Independent living sounds really nice but California's so expensive which is why I'm looking for more affordable options in the midwest.

So I've got a few questions regarding Champaign/Urbana and Bloomington/Normal:

1. What are the services for disabled adults like there? As in, are there programs with job coaches who help out workers or quality case workers like the ones I have in San Diego?

2. How rough are the winters there? I'm not so much concerned about the snow and cold as I am concerned about the ice. Having to re-adjust to winter weather sounds like it could be a pain, especially considering I've lived in San Diego most of my life. My biggest fear would have to be slipping and falling into an intersection while crossing the street. 

3. What's the housing and job situation in Champaign/Urbana and Bloomington/Normal like? Do I have to worry about a housing shortage due to a lot of student residents or is that really limited to only a campus thing?

4. Any hoops I'd have to jump through to get the moving process started?

I know it probably won't be for like 15-20 years but I'd just like an idea of what I'm getting myself into. Would relocating to that area of the midwest be a good idea in the long run given my situation? I'd like to live somewhere not so car dependent but at the same time, I'd rather not break the bank and move to somewhere like New York City. ",0,1729371430.0,SameGrassButGreener,7,0.27,False

I'm sitting at this weekends show with the only options for food/coffee on site being overpriced and terrible quality food trucks/vendors. No catering on this one sadly, which is common on our shows most of the time.

So it led me to thinking of some sort of road case that could come on shows with us and unpack to turn into a mini mobile kitchen. Something with a coffee maker, microwave, maybe a mini fridge and a panini press.  It would be so great to have that on hand and make the quality of work go up tenfold when you're stuck on site for 14 hours.

Do anyone of you have any experience with those sorts of things? Possibly DIY something, I know there are also some prebuilt options out there too.  Having one would likely mean a circuit dedicated to this idea but if it's do-able per the show power then heck yeah!

The Lyriq (Sport 1 AWD, Black/Black) is my first non-Tesla EV! So far I love the car and wanted to dump my random thoughts coming from Tesla.

* Feel: customizing the braking and acceleration to Sport; the steering to Touring; one-pedal braking to normal provides the most equivalent ""feel"" to my Teslas.
* Fit and Finish: the fit and finish and quality of materials are so much nicer than Tesla. Sure I'm comparing a new vehicle to my older Tesla's, but the difference is noticeable.
* Smell: the ""new car smell"" is stronger in the Lyriq than I prefer. I've been airing it out with the windows open every night and planted a few bags of coffee beans in the cabin to help get rid of the smell. I've already wiped down all the plastic with Aerospace 303 protectant, and wiped the leather seats with leather cleaner. Hopefully this helps the smell dissipate quicker.
* Handling: I'm adjusting to the handling of the Lyriq since it is a larger SUV. I'm sure I'll adjust to it eventually but the car just feels wider and it's difficult to ""place"" the car in curves or even in parking lots.
* Carplay: I don't use Apple CarPlay much, since I prefer to use the built-in Google Maps and Spotify apps just like my Tesla's. Honestly, CarPlay just looks ugly to me. Side note: I wish there was room for a few extra shortcut icons along the bottom of the screen.
* Phone charger: the phone charger only works 50% of the time on the first try. I have to remove the phone and put it back in a few times if I get the ""can't charge wirelessly, check for metal objects"" message.
* HomeLink: the homelink button icon is hard to find, but I might just need to get used to the button layout. It also doesn't always work on the first press. I have to play around with backing my car out at different distances to get my garage door to respond.
* Subscription: I'll probably signup for the basic Onstar service once my trial expires so I can keep my Google Maps navigation without the phone hotspot workaround. But this is annoying since it should be free.
* Storage: I ordered the under console organizer off Amazon to give me some more storage space. Smaller items just slide around down there which is annoying. The armrest storage is shockingly small. Also what's up with the awkward cave of space in the driver's side door pocket? ",7,1729371339.0,CadillacLyriq,4,1.0,False

1. She only has her job as Deputy Director of the Parks department because of her mom - she explicitly confesses this pretty early on 
2. When she becomes city councillor she via Chris gets April job as Deputy Director of Animal control. They barely held a search for employees. Yeah purposefully do a shitty search so you can hire your friends is a bold strategy.  
3. Only people she likes get the best opportunities, this is why even though April is openly insubordinate and often times bad at her job previously, she is promoted above Jerry, even though Jerry has been with the Parks department longer than her 
4. When she becomes a regional director for the national parks service, she hires all of her friends. Again what makes her friends more qualified than a general open search for talent or hiring from within the National parks service. Working for a very small town Parks Department is much different than overseeing national parks. 
5. Jon Hamm's character is show to be as incompetent maybe slightly worse than Jerry, yet is given much less chances than Jerry got, because Jerry is still more closer within her inner circle than this new guy, and so the new guy gets fired, after I think a year, but Jerry is still in the corner there spilling coffee on important documents
6. In the finale, she gives Ron the job of ranger for the new Sweetums park and Ron even confronts Leslie and tells her that there must be more qualified people - essentially telling her she is engaging in nepotism. She is so shameless in this scene and basically says ""I dont care, I want my friend to be happy"". Yes Ron is a good outdoorsman, but how does she know that Ron would be the most qualified. She basically again pulled her nepotism strings to get her friend a job. 

The entire show is a lesson for why you should let people into job roles on the basis of nepotism. Because like a virus, they will engage in the same practices themselves, leading to underqualified employees.

And don’t even get me started on how they tell **stories**. Like, ""Oh, when I was a freshman, things were SO different."" **OH REALLY, TIMOTHY?** You mean, LIKE LAST SPRING? Let me grab my pen and take notes from your wisdom-filled diary about how the bus stops were way less crowded than they are today. It is literally not that big of a deal.

OH, and when they start talking about professors like they’re on a first-name basis with them. ""Yeah, you know, Dr. Smith? Total legend. I had her for Calc last semester."" Bro, YOU raised your hand ONCE and she called you the wrong name. Stop acting like you’re grabbing coffee with her after office hours and discussing life goals.

The worst part? They think they’ve got college **figured out**. They act like they’ve unlocked some secret cheat code to life that us ""lowly"" freshmen could never grasp. ""Oh, you just don’t understand yet. But don’t worry, you will. Someday."" **OH WILL I?** Is there like a *ceremony* I need to attend? Is there a mystical scroll involved that magically imbues me with knowledge on how to find the right classroom without Google Maps?

No, I get it, you’ve spent **TWO more semesters** here than me, and now you’re basically the Oracle of Delphi, here to bless us poor underlings with your infinite sophomore wisdom. Please, shower me with your knowledge. What’s next? You gonna tell me how to use a printer? Because I still can’t figure that out, Rebecca.

I can't wait for them to hit **junior year**. Honestly. Maybe then they’ll start speaking exclusively in riddles and initiate us with some cryptic, ancient sophomore chant. ""To pass the test, you must first… complete the sacred art of the group project, where one does all the work and others claim the glory.""

So yeah, sophomores: Congrats on being **slightly** older than me and knowing a secret path from your dorm to class that saves 15.28 zeptoseconds. You’ve really reached the pinnacle of human existence. I look forward to receiving your unsolicited advice on which dining hall has the best cookies like it's some state secret.

He told me that he loved going to that dog park. I responded saying I did too especially when work piles up. I thought overall it was a really good conversation. Then, a few hours later, he added to the message about the dogs saying “and since you’re as cute as those pup, I need to get that number of yours.” This shocked me cuz I don’t know this guy AT ALL. We just follow each other on instagram because we go to the same school. He’s older than me and we never talked before this. But, nevertheless, I gave him my number because I thought that he was nice and I liked the conversation that we were having. Hours later, we were just talking about random stuff, when he asked me out on a date. I said I really appreciated it, but I’m still adjusting to my new schedule and not really looking for anything at the moment. But then he said “nothing serious just coffee” just as a side note, I can’t drink coffee because of health reasons. I also told him this and he continued saying “since you aren’t a coffee gal, how about just a library thing?” I really appreciate him accommodating but I still don’t really want to go on a date with him. I talked some friends and family, and they said that it could be nice just to meet him. But I literally know nothing about him, and like I said earlier, he’s older (2 years to be specific) and my mom brought up that he could be “looking for new meat” I haven’t responded to the library text yet, and I don’t know what to do?

Any advice? Thank you so much if you made it this far into this post!

1g7iceo,https://www.reddit.com/r/unexpected_shaft/comments/1g7iceo/my_family/,My family ,"I can always count on my family for a hand whenever/wherever/however that hand might be required. My family has always been really open with nudity like walking around the house naked while getting ready, jumping in the pool for a bit without swimming suits, stripping down after getting dirty oustide, etc. It's normal to us. We carry on as usual even when naked. 

  
I woke up on my birthday to my mom opening my door. She's a heavier set woman but not huge with breasts that are a couple hand fulls each and a large round ass that jiggles so nicely when smacked. It was the year I reached the age of consent and my mom couldn't wait until I woke up. She came and sat on the bed next to me glancing between my face and morning wood standing up beneath the sheet. My sister was usually the one that took care of me on my birthday but she was off with some volunteer group. My mom was asking about what I wanted to do for the day since I was taking the day off from school. I told her I thought I'd just hang around the house and relax. As we talked my mom slowly rubbed her hand up and down my thigh making my hardon twitch. A small spot of wetness formed at the tip making the sheet darken. My mom took this opportunity to slowly slip her hand beneath the covers. She had shifted them over when she sat down for easier access and I nearly lost it when her hand touched my bare thigh her fingernails running up to my hip then slowly tracing a path back down until she was inline with my shaft. I gasped when her hand flattened across my hairless groin her thumb hooking on the base of my shaft before she wrapped her hand up and around my shaft. My mom said that if I was just going to relax around the house then I don't need to cover up flipping my sheet back with her other hand. 

My mom's hand was squeezing the precum out of my shaft as she stroked me. I closed my eyes enjoying the attention when I felt a tongue dart across my slit. I opened my eyes to my mom licking her lips. She parted her lips after blowing me a kiss and slurped the head of cock into her mouth. My mom likes to work the head and shaft with her lips/tongue because she has a terrible gag reflex. I found that out when I bucked my hips into her mouth making her cough up saliva all around my cock. She apologized for not being able to swallow me like I wanted and I told her she didn't need to apologize for the perfect birthday gift. My mom stroked and sucked me for a few minutes before I heard my dad asking what the birthday boy wanted for breakfast. My mom released my head from her lips long enough to say she was working on it and went right back to sucking. My dad had stepped into the doorway saying, ""well I can see you're working on your breakfast already."" I smiled at him laying my head back onto the pillow again processing the fact that my dad was standing there watching my mom suck me off. My mom simply gave him a thumbs up without releasing her suction on me or stopping her swirling tongue. My dad said ""enjoy"" and chuckled as he made his way down the hallway. 

My mom worked my cock without stopping for a while when I suddenly twitched all the sudden. My mom shifted her attention to the very tip with her mouth but took longer strokes with her hands. Within a second or two I was shooting my cum onto my mom's tongue. She captured it all in her mouth and swallowed without hesitation. After she milked the last drops from my still rock hard cock, my mom got up still stroking my cock telling me to be sure to pee before coming to breakfast. She kissed my forehead, my lips, the tip of my cock and finally planted her lips on each of my balls before heading to the kitchen. She said that my dad might want to see me after I finally get up

By this point in time a few of my friends and I had been fucking whenever we found the time so when I walked into the living room to find my dad sitting in his chair I had to walk right up beside him with my instantly chubby cock starting to stand up at chin level to him. I was facing the towards the tv with him but I could see him looking at my cock out of the corner of my eye which was making him slowly grow. My dad said he thought my mom had taken care of that for me and I replied by taking a step towards him as I turned to face him with my mostly stiff cock pointing at him not even a foot away. He just opened his mouth and sucked me in. Unlike my mom, my dad has no real gag reflex as I found out when he had his nose pressed into my groin and my cock in his throat. He kept his head still as I started face fucking him. My mom had stopped making noise in the kitchen so I turned to look through the doorway to see her smiling like at idiot at me face fucking my dad. This wouldn't be the only time my dad would be lounging in his chair with my cock in his mouth or the only time he swallows a load from my balls either. 

I was taking longer strokes as I fucked his mouth and he looked up at me trying to halfway smile letting his drool run down over my balls to drip onto the armrest of his chair. He pulled his head from my hands and let my shaft rub across his face while he licked my balls free of the excess saliva sucking on each of balls several times. I was getting close to cumming so I pushed his head back far enough to get my tip in his mouth then pulled his head back down onto my shaft until his nose was again buried in my groin. I held him there until he had to take a breath pulling him right back down after he did and dumped my load straight into his throat. He gulped it all down like an expert pulling me back up some so he could milk the last drops onto his tongue. My dad let me slip from his lips seeming very content with what had just happened. I had other plans, though, becasue I had spied his hard-on under his robe and wanted to see it. I knelt down in front of my dad's chair pulling his robe apart.

I was greeted with a decently thick cock around 5-5.5"" and hard as a rock. I closed my eyes and licked up his shaft enjoying the texture of his throbbing cock. I slurped noisily at his bulbous head feeling my dad lift his hips trying to get more into my mouth so I dove for bottom. His hand found the back of my head and pushed my nose into his pubes. He removed his hand and I continued working his cock with my mouth. I hadn't even been sucking my dad for 5 mins yet and he twitched hard dumping the first two shots of his cum into my mouth with the rest going striaght into my throat. After gulping his load down I pulled him slowly from my mouth savoring the lingering musk of his sperm. My mom was now standing behind the couch adjusting her night gown from where she had been playing with herself and said if we were ready for our second breakfast we could move to the table in the kitchen. 

My parents were talking at the table after we had cleared it from breakfast and I rejoined them after getting another cup of coffee. Instead of sitting back where I was I pulled a chair between my parents. I sat down and leaned back a bit letting them sort out who would fondle my balls and who would get the shaft. We sat there talking for some time with them alternating between who's hand was where. I was getting hard again so I began to slowly work my mom's night gown up her leg. I slipped my hand under the edge and slithered my way between her legs to my warm wet prize that was dripping wet already. The squishy sounds my fingers made in my mom's pussy were so enticing that I was rock hard once again. My mom loved that I was able to get hard for her again and asked me to slide my chair back some more. I did as she asked and she turned in her seat to suck my head into her mouth. My dad didn't say anything but bent over and started sucking at my lower shaft and balls. I was in heaven with both my parent's mouths playing with my cock and balls at the same time. My dad took a breath after releasing one of my balls from his mouth and asked if I wanted to take my mom to the couch. I told him I didn't care where we went as long as I got some of her sloppy pussy. 

My mom reluctantly removed her lips from my cock kissing the head again before leading me by my cock to the living room. She let me go to pull her night gown off over her head revealing her bbw milf body I was going to get to fuck whenever I wanted from now on. I turned her around pushing my cock between her legs rubbing her clit with one hand and a breast with the other. I kissed/sucked at her neck as she got more and more turned on until she could no longer stand it. My mom turned and laid down on the couch with her arms and legs spread wide motioning for me to get in her. I kneeled between her thick soft legs rubbing one as I guided my cock to her wanting hole that was glistening with her fluids. The tip of my cock contacted her pussy lips and she reached down to feel me with her finger tips. She tickled me as I parted her lips with my cock and pushed into the pussy I had came from years before. I remember expecting an older woman who's had kids to be looser or not feel as good as say my sister but, while not the same, she felt just as good as my sister. 

I reveled in my mom's pussy caressing my cock in it's velvety warmth. Slowly I started pumping my mom with my cock. Thankfully I had already cum twice or it would have been a short session. I got faster and faster until I was all out pounding my mothers pussy filling the house with the sounds of sloppy sex. My balls were soaked from my mom and I couldn't believe how she was still getting wetter as we fucked. I was sucking on my mom's nipples when it suddenly hit me. I rammed deep into my mom grinding my hips against hers when I popped inside her with one of the best orgasms I could remember. I probably spent 20-30 mins with a half hard cock still stuffed inside her while I kissed, licked, and sucked my way around her chest. My mom caressed my head as I did what I wanted saying, ""that's good baby. Suck momma's tits while your beautiful cock marinates inside momma's cream filled pussy."" She had her legs wrapped around my ass keeping me inside her as she held me like a child making me feel like only a mother can. I finally told her I needed to move because my legs were starting to cramp up from being in the same position for so long and she reluctantly let me get up. Best I could do was roll to the side and sit there for a while so my mom rolled over on to her side with her head in my lap so she could suckle at my limp cock. 

My dad walked over with open robe and a hard cock. My mom looked up at him with an open mouth so he knelt down on the edge of the couch letting her suck him. I reached under him to fondle his balls while my mom worked. Within ten minutes my mom was aiming my dad's cock right over mine letting his cum shoot out onto me. She squeezed him like a tube of toothpaste licking off the last drop from his cock then turned her focus to my now cum coated cock that needed to be cleaned off. My mom started licking at my shaft and my dad dropped to his knees to share my cock and balls with her for the second time that morning. I was partially hard again but knew it wasn't going to get much better so I told them I needed a break and a shower. My mom asked for a few more minutes and I can't deny her what she wants so I let her impale herself on me since I was hard enough to get in her. A few minutes turned into another half hour of my mom riding me and my dad sucking my balls until I was dry firing into her. My dad moved back to his chair but my mom stayed on my cock for another 20-30 mins slowly grinding her hips on me. She held my head kissing my forehead repeatedly while rubbing her tits all over my face. When she finally got off me my cock fell out soft and wet enough to leave a trail across the leather like a slug.  Who knew parents could be so much fun.



My sister and I grew up experimenting with each other for many years. Even after getting old enough to have sexual adventures with others and after she got married (no her husband doesn't know) we have continued to share our bodies whenever possible. She was also the first one to penetrate my ass opening up my  My sister went to the local big name college which I was excited about since it would keep her close by. She's a good looking woman with DD tits, slim waist but a somewhat small barely round ass. She looks top heavy with her soft long legs. Once I was old enough but still in high school, my sister began playing with me in the bathroom with the door open right across from our parents room. It helped that my mom and dad had made their wishes very clear on wanting a ""family with benefits."" One morning my sister was naked in the bathroom getting ready to go to class and I came in behind her naked as well to rub my morning wood against her ass. She spun us around sliding her ass down my legs turning when she hit her knees. She used her tongue to get me coated in her spit so she could suck me as far down her throat as she could in one go. She couldn't bottom me out but she got 3/4 or better in and I loved how her throat felt. How it still feels to this day. 

My sister was running her lips and tongue up and down the sides of my throbbing precum leaking cock when our mom opened her bedroom door smirking with wide eyes. Our mom said, ""well good moring to you two"" and we responded in kind with my sister immediately shoving my cock back into her throat. I had picked my sister up and placed her on the counter by the time our dad got up. I was balls deep in her pussy slow fucking her and kissing/biting on her neck when our dad was on his way to the kitchen. I didn't see him but my sister said she just waved at him and smiled while she softly moaned. I gave my sister an orgasm and a big load of cum. It was the first time my parents had seen us having sex openly. I went into the kitchen with my parents my chubby cock still glistening with my sisters juices. My parents didn't seem to mind and my mom even gave me a good morning squeeze.

From basically avoiding a straight up answer all together to ""have you considered claiming the tea and coffee in your kitchen?"" and anything in between.

* Places that feel cultured, diverse, ethnic, rooted speak to my soul... I have Italian heritage, and I'd really like to be around more Italian-Americans.
* I make 85K/year—I *could* spend a lot more, but it must be *worth it* and as some point there's a cap. **Good value** is supreme.
* I want to be either **in** a medium-sized city, or **around** a larger city.
* I prefer to walk places, but I also plan to keep my car. (Good public transit is a bonus for me.)
* I'm in my mid-30s. It would be nice to befriend some people my age, but I also value younger and older generations.
* Access to good food and coffee is a must: restaurants, cafes, farmers markets, (ethnic) grocers, etc.
* Being close to a large body of water—salt or fresh—and having varied topography is good for my head. No more flat cornfields.
* I love experiencing all of the seasons. I also happen to like clean air and water.
* I am pretty rational when it comes to politics, and I enjoy engaging with people along the political spectrum. I do not appreciate heavy regulations, bureaucracy, being preached at, babysat... you get it.

Currently, I am considering:

1. Philadelphia
2. Counties *outside* of NYC (*maybe* Queens, or Staten Island): Northern NJ, Western Long Island, Yonkers, etc.

I don’t even have a job right now, so I’m stuck in this cycle of hyper-focusing on job applications or completely procrastinating when I feel too overwhelmed to deal with the process. It’s such a struggle to make myself apply. I keep crafting and tweaking resumes over and over, saving them on my computer, but then I can’t even remember which one I used or saved, even if I label them by job title, company, and date. I feel confused all the time, even though I’m using dual monitors—one for ChatGPT suggestions, the other for my Word documents.

On top of that, my house is constantly a mess. Clothes and things are everywhere, and some days I just want to throw everything out because it’s so overwhelming. I’ll start cleaning, get distracted by something else that needs to be done, and before I know it, the day’s over and I haven’t accomplished anything.

2. Day 2 - Free AM (thinking of walking around to see Beverly Hills, or possibly do a studio tour), 12PM event in Carson
3. Day 3 - AM in Carson, open afternoon (possibly go see Santa Monica, or a mueseum
4. Day 4 - early flight out of LAX

Multiple people have suggested avoiding staying in DTLA, but it seems possibly best logistically for night 1. Though I have something temporarily booked in Beverly Hills, but it seems like an hour each way depending on traffic to get downtown.

Night 2 I am debating staying in Manhattan beach area to be close to Carson, but open to suggestions.

Night 3, debating just staying close to LAX.

Hello there, Reddit!

I’m a 25-year-old guy, born and raised somewhere far, but now making a big leap to Bangalore! Yes, I know — Bangalore’s changed, and trust me, I’ve seen all the debates and posts about it online. But hey, that doesn’t stop me from being excited to explore this city for myself and find its hidden gems!

The real reason I’m here, though, is to say a big hello! I’d love to connect with people here, whether you’ve lived in Bangalore your whole life or you’re a fellow newcomer like me. Let’s share stories, tips, and maybe even a coffee or two as we navigate this vibrant city.

I’m all about meeting new folks, exchanging perspectives, and just enjoying life with respect and good vibes. So, who’s up for a friendly intro? Feel free to drop a comment or DM — let’s see where this takes us! 🙃💕

I'm thinking of performing this at an open mic event sometime.,"So, yeah. I want to perform this and act it out on stage. It would be funny because of how animated you can get and how you can voice James Hetfield and the EA Sports guy. What does everyone think?

  
This is the story of Mark and Amy. Mark and Amy have been married for 5 years. They have been dating for two. They love each other. They are madly, deeply in love. I'm talking beginning of romance type of love. Every time they look into each others eyes, they see love. Mark will never hurt Amy. Amy will never hurt Mark. They are there for each other. They care for each other.

One particular Sunday evening, they are going out to the movies. They get in Mark's Ford F-150 and Mark holds the door for Amy. They drive to the movie theater, buy their tickets, and sit down in their seats. The movie trailer voice over guy comes on and says

""Coming this Spring. What do you get when you get two lovers in a jacuzzi who are madly deeply in love with each other? Hot Chocolate! Rated PG13. Maybe rated R""

Midway through the movie, Mark puts his arm around Amy, making sure to touch her shoulder. Amy rests her head on Mark during the movie. They are caring more about being in each others presence than watching the actual movie. Amy lies her head on Mark. Mark has his arm around her. True love. Have you felt this? Have you ever felt the one you deeply care about being next to you where nothing else matters? That's exactly what this is about. As the movie ends, they sit through the credits. They share a tender kiss. Nothing can beat this moment except for the popcorn guy who kicked them out because he has to mop up the popcorn spill.

As they drive home in complete silence, enjoying each others company, the song ""In your Eyes"" by Peter Gabriel comes on. Their favorite song! They approach their home and they sit in the car for a few moments. They just sit. Enjoy each others company. They then lean into each other and share a kiss. They look into each others eyes. Mark touches Amy's cheek. Mark kisses her again. Nothing else matters. True love. They both exit the car and enter the house.

The next morning, they are eating breakfast. Mark is eating the last of his oatmeal, Amy is eating the last of her eggs. They both finish their breakfast, do the dishes, and are about to close off on their day. Mark leaves to go outside, but before he does, he turns to Amy.

""Amy, dear."" Mark said. ""Could you please go shopping before work today? We are out of groceries""

""Yes, dear, is there anything specific you would like me to buy?""

""The usual"" Mark says ""Oatmeal. Milk. Chocolate milk. Protein powder. Apples. Oranges. Tuna. Kale. Lettuce. Ground beef. Chicken. Broccoli. Corn. Peas. Green beans. Cauliflower. Russet potatoes. Baked potatoes. Brownie mix. Shaving cream. And don't forget the bananas!""

""I won't forget the bananas!""

They embrace and Mark heads outside. On his way to the car, he waves to his next door neighbor, James Hetfield from Metallica. He waves to his other neighbor, the guy who does the voice over for EA Sports. He wave to their other neighbor, who is a professional Mime. Mark gets in his truck and drives off to work.

Now, let's back up here. This sounds like a nice loving romance, doesn't it? However, there is something seriously wrong with Mark. He has intermittent explosive disorder. For those of you who don't know what intermittent explosive disorder is, that means you go from 0 to 100 IN A MATTER OF SECONDS! ANGER ISSUES! HE HAS SERIOUS ANGER ISSUES! His only medication is potassium, catechin, and resistant starch. What is the only fruit that has these ingredients? Bananas!

Anyway.

Mark is at work. He's having a great day. Amy is also having a great day. Midway through at noon time, Amy sends Mark a text.

""Hey dear! Hope you're having a great day! Can't wait to see you tonight!""

Mark sends a text back.

""Hey dear! Can't wait to see you tonight either! I am having a great day and hope you are too!'  


Everyone has a good day at work. Mark finishes up his work day, packs up his truck, and heads home! He's ready to see his love! Mark heads home and comes to the door. He embraces Amy in a warm, loving embrace! They kiss. They hug. They have a deep, intense hug, the kind that dreams are made out of.

""Amy. Did you go shopping?""

""Yes! I got all the groceries. I got the Oatmeal. The milk. The chocolate milk. The protein powder. The apples. The cauliflower. The chicken. The ground beef. The pizza. The shaving cream and the coffee grounds""

""Did you get the bananas?""

Oh no. Amy didn't get the bananas.

""Oh, no. I'm sorry, Mark. They were out of bananas. I didn't get them.""

""What do you mean you didn't get them?""

""I did not get the bananas!""

AND THAT""S WHEN THE SHIT HIT THE FAN! Mark was now quivering with anger.

""YOU MEAN TO TELL ME YOU GOT ALL THE GROCERIES BUT YOU DIDN'T GET THE BANANAS?""

""Baby, I'm sorry. They were all out!""

""BABY? DO I LOOK LIKE I WEAR DIAPERS TO YOU?""

""Honey! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry""

""HONEY? DO I LOOK LIKE I'M A BEE TO YOU?""

""Babe. I'm sorry. Please calm down""

""DO I LOOK LIKE A TALKING PIG TO YOU?""

Mark was so angry he threw the jar of pickles against the wall and punched the microwave. He took the cheese and smeared it on the wall and kicked the cabinet.

""Baby. Please....""

""BABY!?!?!""

Mark was so mad, he went into the bathroom, grabbed the toilet and RIPPED the toilet off the hinges, lifted the toilet up over his head with the seat down hovering over him, getting all the toilet water all over him, and THREW the toilet at Amy. Amy ducked and the toilet flew out the window and landed on Neighbor James Hetfield's car.

James Hetfield from Metallica, walked over to Mark's house and knocked on his door. Mark answered.

James said ""Hey! I'm trying to sleep! Would you mind keeping the noise down so I can drift off to never never land!""

""FUCK YOU JAMES MEGADETH IS BETTER""

Mark slammed the door in James face and punched a hole through the door. He then started screaming loudly as he threw the ketchup and mustard out the window. The EA sports guy heard all the commotion and knocked on Mark's door.

""Hey! You! Mark! Please be quiet so I can get some sleep. In. The. House""

Mark shoved the EA sports guy down. Mark's third neighbor, The Mime, walked up to Mark and said ""Mark. Please. I got a gig tomorrow. I'm trying to sleep""

Mark stared at the Mime and lifted his middle finger up.

""That's disrespectful"" The Mime said, shaking his head disappointedly at Mark. ""You oughtta be ashamed of yourself.""

A random group of teenage boys drove by and threw some cola at the Mime  


""AWWW FUCK ALL OVER MY NEW PANTOMIME SUIT!"" The Mime yelled, echoing throughout the streets ""FUCK MY LIFE AND FUCK YOU MARK""

Mark starts mimicking The Mime by doing the ""Glass Window Hand Thing"" that Mime's do. The Mime turned around to walk away but steps in dog poop.

""GOD DARN DOG! I JUST STEPPED IN DOG SHIT! CAN THIS DAY GET ANY WORSE?""

The Mime walked away.

Meanwhile. Back in the house. MARK THEN TOOK THE HAM AND TURKEY FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THREW IT ALL OVER THE HOUSE AND SMEARED PEANUT BUTTER ALL OVER THE PLACE. Amy is scared. Now crying. Tears rolling down her face. Mark took the glass of milk that Amy was drinking and threw it against the wall, shattering the glass everywhere. He took a phone book that was lying on the ground and ripped it in half! He took the TV in the living room and threw it against the wall. He then stared at Amy and pointed at her like how Hulk Hogan points at his opponent before body slamming them.

""THIS IS ALL BECAUSE YOU FORGOT THE BANANAS!""

All of a sudden, the police sirens are heard. Two cops in cop cars came rushing up to the house. One of the cops rushes out of the car and hurries up to the house and hands Mark a banana. As Mark peals the Banana and takes a bite, he finds complete satisfaction in it, and devours the entire thing. He is now back to normal! The medication has done it! Mark has been brought back down to earth from the taste of a banana! He looks around and notices Amy, who is clearly distraught from the whole situation.

""Amy! Baby! What has happened? Did I have another intermittent explosive disorder fit?""

""You did! The banana has saved you!""

""Come here and give me a hug!""

""Are you back to normal?""

""I am back to normal.""

Mark and Amy both hug and everything is back to normal.

1g7hz4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1g7hz4x/how_can_i_29nb_set_boundaries_with_mom_65f/,How can I (29NB) set boundaries with mom (65F) regarding unemployed BF (32M)?,"Tl;dr
My mother (65F) and I (29NB) had a massive arguement about my currently unemployed BF (32M). We've been together 1.5 yrs, and he's been unemployed for most of that time. My mother pushed me to dump him because she views him as a lazy, unmotivated slob. Many hurtful things were said, and she refused to apologize. That said, I also know that I want BF to be financially stable before we discuss next steps (e.g., moving in together). I don't know what to do.

Full story
I (29NB) met my boyfriend (32M) last summer through online dating. He's sweet and kind. Our finances are very separate (we treat each other on occasion but split most things 50/50). He doesn't have a car and we live on opposite ends of the city - I usually end up driving to his, but we've talked about him bussing to mine more often. He was laid off in fall 2023 and has yet to find full time work.

My mom (65F) has never liked him - she was reluctant to have coffee with him around the 6 month mark and has since made me very aware of her disapproval (passive-aggressive comments, uninviting him from holiday gatherings, etc.). She's compared him to her ex-husband many times and views BF as a lazy, unmotivated slob. She's worried that I'm ""getting taken advantage of"" and has worried that ""he'll never amount to anything or make enough to take care"" of me. 

I can't say that I'm thrilled BF is still unemployed after more than a year, but he's trying. He applies to 20-30 jobs per week and has reached out to local job centres for advice. He freelances, but nothing stable yet. I genuinely don't know what more he could be doing. But I also know my relationship will be stagnant so long as he's unemployed. 

He is messy (I've never, ever said ""slob"") - he has ADHD and depression, so he finds it difficult to keep up with cleaning. The mess only bothers me when I'm very stressed out (my anxiety gets worse in messy surroundings when I'm already anxious).

Mom and I had a massive argument over a family lunch today (with her, myself and my father, 67M) where I got very upset and stormed out. Basically, my mom said I upset her by being with him and that I should end my relationship. I said she upset me by being hypercritical when she doesn't know him and doesn't try to get to know him.

I feel bad for getting upset, but mom couldn't even apologize for upsetting me. She said she was ""disappointed"" - when I asked if that was directed at me or BF, she said ""both."" This isn't anything new either, it's been going on for a year - but never bad enough for me to storm out.

How can I figure out if I should end my relationship with BF or set more strict boundaries with mom? Any advice welcome and appreciated.",1,1729369877.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Hey all. I’m a 38m, white, and relatively athletic. 6’3” 215 pounds. For the last year and a half I’ve been dry heaving in the mornings. This usually lasts around 5 minutes a morning. I rarely actually throw anything up unless it’s right after having a cup of coffee or something. It doesn’t stop me from doing anything, and I usually feel just fine afterwards. 

Some context:

- I have a beer or two in the evenings to relax, but never drink to inebriation.

- I’ll occasionally smoke weed in the evening, and if the dry heaving doesn’t stop a small hit helps it. The dry heaving began before I started smoking again.

- I work in labor, and am rarely sedentary.

- I’ve been to my GP, but all bloodwork came back normal and they weren’t interested in diving further into it.

- no one else in our family is having these sort of issues

- I have chronic kidney stones but I don’t feel like that has anything to do with this.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do, or what might be causing this? TIA!",1,1729369778.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

I’m a 28M and I have been having dry mouth for about 5-5.5 days now. It’s not dry enough where I am needing water or liquids to help get food down, but dry enough that it feels thicker in there. About 3 days ago I felt mild dry eyes. Nothing that causes me to having an itch, or burning sensation or anything, but they also just “feel” drier. As well as when I took my contacts out at the end of the day (disposables) they’re usually a bit wet and flimsy, but last night they were more in the rubbery category - which made me worry about potential dry eyes? 

I do also feel a dry-ish throat. The dry mouth/throat symptoms worsen much more at night, and no amount of water fixes it. My nose has still a bit of viscous lubrication in it, but also feels drier. This is coupled with a bit of a dry-ish cough that has a little phlegm come out. I have no other main symptoms. My muscles and joints feel fine, I have no fatigue and am active every day (working out in a powerlifting sense for the last 6 years). 

These symptoms started when I had gotten back from a 2 week vacation to Japan. I had not properly hydrated myself through the trip (very very hot and ended up drinking many teas and Gatorade-esque drinks instead of water). I came back and immediately began a rigorous workout plan again and then after 4 days had to take a flight out to Winnipeg for a work conference. This trip lasted 3 days and I didn’t drink enough water again, mainly relying on coffee and teas. I got back home last Wednesday and again began my rigorous workout routine trying to get back into shape. I noticed on Thursday night a hard lump under my tongue, which I looked up and assumed was a salivary gland stone. I tried to push it out with my fingers but it was to no avail. It left the area a bit red and puffy but nothing abnormal. The next day when drinking some water and swishing it around, I think the stone came out as I didn’t feel it there anymore. Immediately the next day I randomly got a single day long fever that lasted this past Saturday and by the Sunday morning was gone. I was left with a bit of a cough that started phlegmy but has now become mainly dry with a bit of phlegm. I had muscle and joint soreness only on that day because of the fever I assume. 

However since that day, as previously stated, my saliva production fell off, my eyes feel a bit drier and my throat too. I got a blood test and my C-reactive protein was elevated (in a range of 0-5 it was 11.7). I was told my by doctor it probably isn’t sjogrens due to the CRP needing to be much higher (although after looking online it seems sjogrens can have mild CRP levels so that hasn’t shaken my belief yet).

Doctor suspects salivary gland inflammation as when I was in Japan I was having some food and my left under chin gland swell up and it became a bit strange to swallow and was tender to the touch. That went away after 3 days but all these symptoms have come now. I just got a neck ultrasound done and the technician quietly stated that it seems like nothing (I told him I had a stone so idk if they can tell if there is inflammation or if he was saying there seems to be no stone). I have a bit of a small pea sized bump under my left jaw where the initial swelling happened, but no pain. 

I read up on Sjogrens, and with extreme anxiety disorder I haven’t been able to sleep, eat or function properly. I keep crying and crying praying that I don’t have this but many symptoms seem to align, although idk how much they do align. It seems so out of the blue and strange for me to have this disease as there are no autoimmune disorder history in my family and I feel massively depressed and worried for my future. I’ve been in depressive medication for the last 2.5 years and have been stable, but I can confidently say this is the first stretch of days I’ve felt like I used to, depressed and unable to move past this. 

I would just like some answers or thoughts as to what folks think. I’m sorry if my words are everywhere, I’m a massive health worrier and I don’t want anything to happen to me. I know it sounds very selfish to say, because I’m nobody special, but I can’t live like this. I feel life closing in on me and I’m scared. Please give me some insight 🥲",0,1729369150.0,Sjogrens,9,0.4,False

It's really specific I know,  and I'm 100% confident I'll have to reinforce whatever it is to stand the weight so don't worry about finding something that doesn't look sturdy enough.

Here's my list:

🌱Rosehip - I brew tea with it, keeps me feeling full

🧄Cardamon -  add it to black coffee to supress the need to have something sweet with it

🧄Cloves - I add it to chicken bone stock when cooking, gives a warm autumny flavor. I drink stock rarely during fasting hours, only if I feel very hungry, and only a cup, but it's nice for the thing to taste delish

🌿 Thyme + Rose + Mint - my absolute favorite herbal tea (but I don't drink it daily because thyme is very potent and is considered a medicinal herb). This is my ""Let's calm or nerves, shall we"" kind of tea

That's a wrap for now 😊 I will gladly share if I discover anything else.

I had weight loss surgery 7/2023 about 14 months ago.

Between month 3-6, my hair fell out in handfuls. Mostly from my crown area.

Pre weight loss surgery, I had very thick, curly/wavy, fine hair. I had to use a lot of conditioner and have always used shampoos and conditioners that were marketed toward curly hair. Only washed my hair 1 or 2 times a week.

After my hair has started growing back, it has completely changed in composition. 

My hair is horrible now. It is straighter, but not a pretty kind of straight. the texture has changed to kind of a dry hay. It is thinner now and no longer thick, it gets SO oily that I have to wash it every single day. I have had to completely stop using conditioner due to how oily it gets. It gets poofy and frizzy if I let it air dry, it no longer curls nicely.

I don't know what products to use, I don't know how to manage it anymore. I got it cut into a short bob style, which is cute on me, but this washing every single day... trying to combat this GREASE.... I never thought I'd say this but I miss my beautiful curls. 

I am taking a multi vitamin, calcium, biotin, and collagen supplement. I also put vegetarian protein powder in my coffee.

Also, it has started to fall out again within the last few weeks....

here is a before and after picture...
