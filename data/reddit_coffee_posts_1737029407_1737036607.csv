I used to grab an apple, but go tired of those, so I started taking a banana home and started making banana bread. I started with a basic recipe, then added chocolate chips to that.

I thought it was healthy alternative to candy bars and donuts, but realistically it's calorie count was massive, I realized this when I started taking losing weight seriously and started calorie counting.

I removed the added sugar completely, swapped the butter for an avocado (this worked amazingly well), added walnuts, used whole wheat flour, removed the chocolate chips and subsisted cocoa powder.

Unfortunately as I lose weight, I need to continue to cut calories to reach my goal, but eating 500-600 calories of this a day has to change if I want to continue progress further.

Does anyone have any tips? Or is it simply too much flour and I'm better off just giving it up? If so, does anyone have an alternative I can have with my morning coffee?",1,1737036412.0,Volumeeating,1,1.0,False

I thought I had the issue remedied a while back, but after installing an update onto my Lenovo laptop my audio drivers were reset to the outdated ones.

This is an extremely outdated driver, and will break if the sound my laptop gets to be too much - resulting in static, fuzzyness, etc. I found a way to update the driver but it only lasts until I install a new update from Windows. I've tried everything that I can think of: deleting the old driver file from the laptop, running a driver wizard, etc... nothing seems to work. There must be a way to get the new driver permanently because this is honestly quite frustrating.

To get the 'correct' version of the sound driver that won't break after some time, I have to delete the device (Realtek audio speaker).. I recall being able to delete the speaker through the settings UI, but it seems I have to do it by Device Manager now.

1i2pmon,https://i.redd.it/fpcwfmgs4dde1.jpeg,Is Your Marketing Copy Cutting Through the Noise or Contributing to It?,"In today’s digital world, the sheer volume of content can feel overwhelming. With over 4.4 million blog posts published daily and social media feeds that refresh faster than you can say ""engagement,"" crafting marketing copy that actually stands out is no easy feat. The question is: is your copy resonating with your audience—or is it just more static in an already noisy world?

Here, we’ll explore how to make sure your marketing copy truly cuts through the noise, captivates your target audience, and drives real results. Spoiler alert: If your copy could double as elevator music, you might have some work to do.

Why Most Marketing Copy Gets Ignored
Before you can fix it, you need to understand why so much marketing copy gets lost in the shuffle. Here are the main culprits:

1. It’s Too Generic
Copy that’s overly broad or packed with clichés like “we’re passionate about X” or “leaders in the Y industry” simply doesn’t stick. Your audience has heard it all before. Stand out by being specific, authentic, and speaking directly to their needs.

2. It’s All About You (and Not Your Audience)
Nobody cares that your company won an award in 2012. They care about how you can solve their problem today. Flip the narrative—focus on them first, not your product or accolades.

3. It’s Overloaded with Jargon
“Scalable solutions” and “synergistic integrations” might sound impressive in internal meetings, but to your audience? They mean nothing. Strip the jargon and communicate in clear, relatable terms.

4. It Doesn’t Inspire Action
A wall of text or overly complex messaging without a clear call-to-action (CTA) is destined for oblivion. If your audience doesn’t know what to do next, they’ll do nothing.

How to Create Marketing Copy That Stands Out
Now that we’ve pinpointed the common pitfalls, let’s talk about how to write copy that grabs attention and compels your audience to act.

1. Speak Their Language
Great marketing copy is like a conversation between friends. Use the tone, style, and vocabulary that resonate with your audience. Research how your target demographic communicates—what words they use, what problems they’re discussing—and incorporate that into your copy.

2. Focus on Benefits, Not Features
It’s Marketing 101, yet so many companies still get it wrong. Your audience doesn’t care about your product's specs—they care about how it improves their life. For instance:

Compare:
Feature-Focused Copy: “Our blender has 6-speed settings.”
Benefit-Focused Copy: “Create the perfect smoothie, no matter what ingredients you’re using.”

3. Be Unexpected
To cut through the noise, your copy needs an edge. Use humor, thought-provoking questions, or a surprising statistic to grab attention. For example:

Instead of saying, “Our coffee will wake you up,” try: “Our coffee hits harder than your Monday morning alarm clock.”

Unexpected twists keep readers engaged and make your message more memorable.

4. Tell Stories
Humans are hardwired to connect with stories. Use storytelling to create an emotional connection with your audience. For example:

Share a customer success story: ""Sarah boosted her online sales by 40% in one month using our platform.""
Highlight your brand’s journey or values: ""We started in a garage with one mission—to make high-quality skincare affordable for all.""

Stories humanize your brand and make your message more relatable.

5. Keep It Simple
In a world of endless scrolls, brevity is your best friend. If your copy can be trimmed, trim it. Stick to short sentences, clear ideas, and avoid unnecessary fluff.

6. Incorporate Emotional Triggers
Words that spark emotions—curiosity, excitement, fear of missing out (FOMO)—can drive action. For instance:

""This offer ends tomorrow—don’t miss out!""
""Imagine what your business could achieve with double the leads.""

Visual Guide: Bad Copy vs. Good Copy
BAD COPY:

“Our SaaS tool offers a robust suite of scalable, enterprise-level solutions for modern teams.”

GOOD COPY:

“Run your business smarter, not harder. Automate your to-do list and get more done in less time.”

Keep this in mind: if you can’t imagine your copy as part of a conversation, it’s probably too stiff or confusing.

Metrics That Matter: Measuring the Impact of Your Copy
Even the most creative copy is only as good as the results it drives. Use these metrics to determine whether your marketing is making an impact:

Engagement Rates: Are people clicking, commenting, or sharing your content?
Conversion Rates: How many people are taking the desired action?
Bounce Rate: If visitors are leaving your website without interacting, your copy might not be doing its job.
Time on Page: Are people staying long enough to actually read your content?

Track these metrics consistently to gauge whether your copy is hitting the mark or falling flat.

Examples of Copy That Cuts Through the Noise
1. Nike: “Just Do It.”
It’s short, empowering, and universally understood. A masterclass in simplicity.

2. Slack: “Make work less work.”
This tagline perfectly captures the product’s benefit in just four words.

3. Mailchimp: “Get down to business. And keep it simple.”
A no-frills message that aligns with the brand’s promise of user-friendly email marketing.

Final Thoughts: Are You Cutting Through the Noise?
In the battle for attention, mediocre copy is the enemy. By writing with clarity, authenticity, and an audience-first focus, your marketing can rise above the noise and make a real impact. Remember, every word should have a purpose. If it doesn’t, delete it.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

The truth is, rejection can hit us all hard, whether it’s a job you really wanted, a relationship that didn’t pan out, or even a creative endeavor that just didn’t resonate with anyone other than your mom (and even she has her moments).

But here's the kicker: facing rejection doesn’t have to be the end of the world. In fact, it can be a transformative moment that teaches us resilience—if we let it. I mean, how many times have we heard stories in the Bible about folks who faced incredible odds and rejection, yet still pressed on? Moses didn’t exactly breeze through his journey; he found himself rejected by his own people more than once. And yet, he stood up, dusted himself off, and kept moving forward.

First, let’s talk about grace. Rejection can feel like a blow to our pride, but handling it with grace means acknowledging that this moment doesn't define us. It’s easy to spiral into self-loathing, replaying the rejection in our minds like a bad Netflix series that just won’t end. Instead, take a step back. Breathe. Remember that everyone faces rejection—yes, even that seemingly perfect friend of yours who always has fabulous hair and never misses a workout.

Here’s where the faith part comes in. When we lean on our faith during these tough moments, we’re tapping into a power way greater than ourselves. Think of it as your spiritual back-up, a heavenly safety net. Scripture tells us in Philippians 4:13, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” It's like getting a personal power-up before facing a new level in a video game—you know, the kind that makes you crazy strong, even if you just got knocked down a few times. 

Persistence is just as crucial here. This isn’t a “one and done” scenario. If we take a hit and just give up, we miss out on the potential for growth and for finding something even better down the line. I can’t tell you how many doors seemed firmly closed in my face only to discover that God had a window wide open somewhere else, just waiting for me to push through with a little more determination.

It’s also important to lean on your community during these times. Don’t go at it alone—call up your friends, your family, that supportive group from church. Share your heart with them. You’ll probably find that they have faced their own rejections too, and their stories can provide encouragement and laughter to help you weather the storm. Let’s be real—nothing boosts your spirits quite like a good “can you believe that happened?” debrief with friends over a cup of coffee.

In the end, rejection is merely a pit stop on this journey of life; it’s a chance for growth and an opportunity to trust in God’s perfect timing. So, hold onto your faith, embrace the lessons that come with persistence, and pour out grace onto yourself as you navigate these moments. You’ll emerge tougher, perhaps a smidge wiser, and certainly equipped for whatever comes next. And who knows—a little humor might just be your secret weapon in dealing with the twists and turns. After all, laughter in the face of rejection can be one of the best remedies, and I hear it’s way less medication than trying to fetch your pride from the floor after a disappointing email.",1,1737036070.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

Some even whistle or catcall. Most of these men are much older, in their 30s or more, and some are closer to my age.

Today, I was walking to my friend’s house because the weather was nice, and I didn’t feel like taking an Uber. On the way, I passed three firefighters standing outside a store, drinking coffee and eating wraps. Before I even walked past them, they started whistling and making comments like, “look over here beautiful,” “Your legs must be hurting from walking, let me give you a body massage tonight,” “Can you twerk for me?” and “I’m good with my tongue.” They said even worse things, but I ignored them and pretended to scroll on my phone.

It’s so frustrating because these men are so much older. I can’t stop thinking , how would they feel if someone treated their own daughter like this? This kind of behavior has been happening to me since I was 13, and it still hasn’t stopped.

Now it’s winter, and even when I’m fully covered in sweaters, the staring and comments don’t stop. In summer, it’s even worse when I wear a dress or a skirt and top. They’ll stare at my body like I’m not even a person. Some make disgusting comments about my chest, like, “You’ve got a good set of milkies.” or about my body overall . It’s scary and makes me feel unsafe.

I’m having an issue with my Lelit Anna that I could really use some advice on.

Today, while making coffee as usual, the water tank ran out (this happens from time to time). I immediately refilled it, but after that, the pressure at the group head dropped to 3 bars instead of the usual 8. I also noticed that when the group head isn’t attached, barely any water comes out.

Interestingly, the steam wand is working perfectly fine, and the pump does seem to be drawing water from the tank, but there’s hardly any water coming out on the other side.

I’m wondering if the pump might have been damaged due to running dry briefly. Is this possible? I’ve already ordered a replacement pump just in case, but I’d like to double-check before going ahead with the replacement.

Also, is the pump linked below a suitable replacement for the Lelit Anna PL41EM?

The current 2lb bag of coffee, I had to grind significantly finer when I started using it a couple of days ago. I have gotten in the habit of having my beans arrive 2 weeks before I need them, roasting date on this batch was 12/30. 
19 grams in with a 20 gram IMS basket typically gives me a good 1:2 ratio in about 45 seconds. I have a Barista Gadgets PID running a low pressure (20%) pump for 10 seconds , typically then the first drips appear. Over the next 8 seconds it ramps up to 100% (9 bar OPV). By the way, last few bags of beans my shot time variation was within normal, a couple of seconds.
In between shots, I remove the portafilter, wipe out or rinse if too much is left behind, then grind the next dose. I carefully WDT and tamp each dose, and started using a paper filter on top to keep my machine clean. Next shot, everything being equal pulls in under 30 seconds.

My father started getting these TIAs recently. His first was on Oct 31, 2024. Doctors noticed he had very high blood pressure, high cholesterol,..so they gave him pills to help with these things. He did have a few about 4-5 TIAs again after the 1.5week following but once his blood pressure was lower he was good for about a month. He’s changed his food intake, drinking lots of water, cut out coffee, cut out most junk, I even bought him a stationary bike that he tries to use maybe 10mins a day (not much but his pills are very strong that he easily gets dizzy), and I go over about once a week to do a few small weight workouts. 
Then he had another TIA December 12. That was the first one since Nov 17th and he’s been consistently getting more and more. Fast forward to Jan 2025 he’s getting them almost everyday and yesterday he had 6 within 48 hours. 
My dad keeps going to the hospital in the ER and every test he does keeps coming back cleared. They have done MRIs, ERG, CT scans, ultrasounds of his chest and neck. The only thing they did notice was he did have a lump on his thyroid. They don’t think it’s related because it’s located on the right side and my dad becomes paralyzed on the right when he gets a TIA. 
My question to you is have you ever heard of this or experienced it yourself? Do you know what you could be done? if a test was missing or this normal (don’t think it is). It’s a mystery they keep saying?! Like this is insanity we keep doing the same tests and expecting different results. I’m fed up, my family is fed up, my dad is scared he can’t even sleep. I’m sure that could be contributing as well, the stress and lack of sleep. He claims he can’t sleep at all.

Also, Could the thyroid be affecting this?? Like it’s the only possibility I can think of. We do have an appointment with an endocrinologist Feb 19th but that’s literally a month away. We also have a ENT appointment next week too so maybe they will think of something.

I (22/F) met this guy (25/M) through the dating app Tinder, and I found him to be a bit different. He’s not great at starting conversations and tends to be a little shy, so our communication was average at first. However, after we added each other on Snapchat, we started sharing our daily moments as streaks and commenting on each other’s snaps.

After three months of light conversations, he invited me to meet up (I’m not sure if I should call it a date or just a casual meetup) for coffee. He turned out to be a good man, resembling his personality on the phone, but with a more cheerful side in person. We laughed a lot, and he told me about his job, family, and even his future plans. The meeting lasted two hours, and time flew by. I noticed that he has a grounded and polite personality.

What disappointed me a little is that after the meeting, he didn’t say anything particularly special about it. Instead, he continued sharing daily snaps as we used to, but now he’s more open about talking about himself and his life. I’m not sure if he’s actually interested in me or just chatting casually. I checked his social media followers and noticed that he doesn’t have many female friends. He works two jobs and is considering a third one, so he doesn’t have much free time.

What do you think about this situation?

 note: During the meeting, he was considerate, and it was clear that he’s shy but tried to break the ice and create a comfortable atmosphere. I live in a place with many traditions and restrictions, so I can’t meet him often, just to clarify. :)",1,1737035596.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I travelled from Stirling in Scotland to my hometown of Saint-Quentin in the Hauts-de-France region. 


This was my first trip since going vegan. 


In Scotland, I had dinner before leaving but packed a tofu sandwich which I ate on the sleeper! Then in the morning I had a black coffee and some oatly biscuits I had packed. 


In London I had a couple of hours to kill at St Pancras. I went up to the fancy champagne bar mezzanine. It wasn't fancy at all but it was very quiet. I decided to fork out £14 for the vegan breakfast at Carluccio's (see photo) and it was delicious with smashed avo, potatoes and spinach! It kept me full until about 2pm.


After boarding the eurostar, I went to get a tea in the food coach and to my surprise they had oat milk pouches (see photo.) The bar staff was super nice and nonchalant about giving me a lot of them. After that I ate some of the mackies mint chocolate that was on my pillow on the sleeper to tie me til lunch..!


Then my parents picked me up from Lille. According to Happy Cow, there are a lot of nice vegan restaurants in Lille but most of them stopped serving after 2pm and also my dad can't walk far so we just drove towards home, hoping to find a big, all day service chain off the motorway. We stopped at a Flunch restaurant, which a self service buffet. I thought I'd end up eating only bread and sliced tomatoes or something... All the mains had meat and cheese in and while there are a lot of veggie based sides in French cooking, they tend to have dressings containing egg. But the salad bar was absolutely amazing and accidentally vegan friendly. I ate a really filling meal of shredded carrots and beetroot with mustard dressing and a minty tabuleh that had a few rogue edamame beans in there. 


Finally, when we got to my mum's house and I had coffee with oat milk as well as rhythm 101 biscuits I had stock piled on (thanks Asda they were £1 each.) My dad couldn't believe they were vegan. Then, we we went shopping and I found a very decent selection of vegan products.

Come the evening, I was starving due to having had little protein. I cut up these seitan weiner from them supermarket and had olives with it. It was delicious and filling. Then, I drank a few cups of chicory with vanilla oat milk through the evening and went to bed! I was still a bit hungry but also too tired to care.

1i2pafo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NastyWMN/comments/1i2pafo/dealing_with_primary_hyperhidrosis/,Dealing with Primary Hyperhidrosis ,"Hello! 

Had hyperhidrosis all my Life. Primary Hyperhidrosis. Mine is generalized: armpits, feet, hands, skin folds, back..... everywhere. But the worst is hands,feet and armpits. I've tried soooooo many products, but they either dry your skin too much, or burn your skin....or are just so annoying to apply because for me, for instance, my armpits get very wet right after I shower and dry with a towel. There's no point in using products at that time, even if I use a blow-dryer.They just don't absorb properly. So I have to wait and wash my armpits again and then apply. Who wants to live like that? Plus, some products say to apply by night. Another double washing, cause I have already bathed after getting home and before bed have to wash myself again...🙄🙄🙄

Tried Botox on my armpits. I still had wet shirts, but way less. But it's too expensive and a Doctor said he didn't feel it would be advisable to use it all my Life. He's RIGHT.

Tried baking soda. Kind of works for the smell, but I think it's a little agressive to apply every day and not comfortable.

Aluminium in antiperspirants ruin your clothes and traps the smell in them.  So, one day I was fed up and made the detox from them. The transition was bad. Very smelly.  The first two days were on my days off, so I could be more comfortable at home. Eventually, your body purges all that's been trapped in and finds a balance. I then switched to deodorant (without aluminium). It works for me, as long as I choose the right one. Always sweaty, but my armpits don't smell. Dove has one with zink. Amazing. It's a shame it's in a spray formula, cause although it's my favorite formula (because of my pits being always moist) it can be overwhelming and even makes me cough a lot. That's the problem with spray formulas. I got fed up.Too strong to handle when applying . 
That reminds me: roll on formulas for people with hyperhidrosis??? Just hilarious 😆 😆 😆 I think you get me. 

So I started using Cicalfate cream from Avene. The zink really eliminates odor. Not sweat. But then again, people who have hyperhidrosis always sweat..... Even if it's compensatory sweat. 😬

I must admit, at 48 years old, female, I'm really tired of having to apply something on my armpits every single day. I just love the feeling of bare armpits. It's so wonderful. ☺️☺️☺️

So recently, I started taking Zink tablets, from Solgar, and wash my armpits with Spirial Deodorant gel. The brand is SVR.  The odor is under control and I even sweat less. I work in Customer Care, in a Call Center, so I'm exposed to high levels of stress, but I feel it is working and I am sooo surprised, and happy. I'm guessing with time, my perspiration can decrease a lot! 🤞🏻 It can be some type of mineral deficiency.... And it never had occured to me.....
If I drink Coffee, a slight odor will immediately appear and my sweat in general increases. So , I try not to drink it. 
(also started months ago, prior to the zink intake, on a kind of a keto diet to loose weight and I think carbs play a role in sweating too).

It's very unfair that some of us are born with this condition, but one thing I know for sure: aluminium makes it much worse, both in perspiration and in smell, and let's face it: it's bad enough in small amounts, now think about it in large amounts, like in hyperhidrosis products...... it's just something that isn't healthy, no matter what people say.....your skin doesn't breath and product builds up on your system....

I realized deodorant and antiperspirant have one purpose: making money. Even if they work for a long time, at some point they stop working, as I read several times, and that's just frustrating.... And in a great amount of cases, they don't even work properly.... 

And let's face it, some people don't even need them. But they use them cause it's ingrained in our daily routine. Some people should enjoy the fact that they don't need it. ☺️

Starting to realize people with sweat problems or odor problems may just have to find out what mineral supplement works for them and wash some areas with specific products that fortunately are starting to appear.

I suspect Folic Acid really works well with perspiration by the way. Once I decided to take that supplement to increase my immune system, my hands would get very dry. 

Don't do the surgery some Doctors speak about...... sometimes it backfires in very bad ways..... And getting ""shock treatment""????? Hell no! 😱😱 Not for me.

I don't want to offend no one and trust me: I'm very empathetic with people who suffer from this condition. It's frustrating, outside people just don't understand what we go through, socially and personally, on a daily basis, and it makes you sad. 

But we are fooled with all the solutions that are presented to us and Doctors are ""clueless"", cause there is no explanation for Primary HH. They try to help the best as they can.... But in the end...we are just ""lab rats"" or very good clients for the Pharmaceutical Companies. 😡

I just hope the solution I found for me, sticks. I feel much better and relieved.☺️❤️

The quantity seems to be filling and the desert (*Ilayada*) seems to be very good according to my dad.

Googling, I found these about the owner:

Arun Anirudhan owes his journey as a foodpreneur to idli. Modak, his cloud kitchen, set shop by selling this popular South Indian staple and now the menu has expanded to include different types of idli, teas, coffee, snacks, desserts and more.

A native of Idukki, this commerce graduate landed in Thiruvananthapuram to learn graphic designing and, eventually, got a job in Bengaluru. “I worked there only for six months. I had to pursue my dream to become a restaurateur. I realised that I didn’t have the budget to start a restaurant, so I went with the cloud kitchen concept,” says 24-year-old Arun.

That was how Modak was born early this year, at a house at Menamkulam near Kazhakkoottam. “I chose idli because I consider it the most comforting food. Initially, we served the usual idli and later added its variants. Now, we have podi idli, heart-shaped idli, ghee idli and butter idli, with sambar and two varieties of chutneys as sides along with kesari,” he explains.

[https://www.thehindu.com/food/features/modak-cloud-kitchen-in-thiruvananthapuram-has-idlis-teas-fried-milk-and-kesari-on-its-menu/article68491537.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/food/features/modak-cloud-kitchen-in-thiruvananthapuram-has-idlis-teas-fried-milk-and-kesari-on-its-menu/article68491537.ece)

Now before anyone comes at me with whether this is a sponsored post, no it is not. Have seen some redditors want to discuss about food minus the influencer(though it seems influencers have naturally covered this as well from an online search).

1i2p79c,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelanceWriters/comments/1i2p79c/writes_run_your_game/,"Writes, Run Your Game","# Writers, Run your game.

This morning, I received an email from a friend. They explained that I had sent them something to read. They were busy, juggling multiple projects like plates on the end of a stick and one of those projects was about to crash.

Against their better judgment, they read what I sent them and while they enjoyed it, they were now further behind on their work.

They were annoyed and called me out for distracting them. (politely)

First of all, far be it from me to tell anyone how to organize their day. Articles, emails, and digital content have a very long shelf life. Someone recently responded to a comment I made on YouTube about an episode of Homeland in 2012. No joke.

If it is not convenient to look at something, DON’T.

And if you do read the email, blog post, or op-ed article, take a little time to absorb it and leave a comment. Nothing wordy, thumbs up, firecracker emoji, multiple question marks, whatever.

Hopefully, you will enjoy what I am sharing and have some of your perspective to add.

Please do not send passive-aggressive messages like “some people have a life” and “must be nice to sit around playing on the computer” (those sound pretty aggressive but you get the idea), and then not even read the article.

If you are busy, say so.

I started to feel bad a while ago, after sending all my well-meaning friends and relatives various pieces I had written. I could picture these people running away from their inboxes when they saw they had gotten yet another Word document from you know who.

I had things I thought they would want to see. Some pieces were about my family history. I knew it was a commitment to ask someone to read something and I thanked them in advance.

Some people had great responses. They were touched by what I had written. It made them feel more positive and maybe they learned something.

Others were not so enthusiastic. They were grumbling about having to read something. They wanted a funny video to start the day like the one where the cat squeezed through a large doughnut and then its owner came by and, not knowing, ate that same doughnut (true story).

They wanted a little lift with their coffee, and I get it. I can binge YouTube shorts all day long. The guy who is renovating his whole garage in one 30-second video gets my upvote, those crazy cakes they make 50 at a time in Thailand, somebody carrying their whole family to the store on a bike. It’s intoxicating and requires no involvement or thinking.

Sometimes though I want to dig a little deeper. I have something on my mind that needs saying and I write it down. I fluff and polish the words, so they communicate the message. I blast it out.

I am not doing this to burden someone or give them another task on their to-do list. If it is impossible or this isn’t a subject the person cares about, they are welcome to skip it. If it conflicts with their political or spiritual beliefs, they should pass.

However, I decided today that I am not going to apologize for sending someone something I felt strongly enough to write out, spell check, spell check some more, edit, etc., and then publish.

I don’t object when someone sends me a picture of their coffee, a random sunset they like, or multiple pictures of a hike in the woods. I read through all the content I get. Some is spiritual and I wonder if the person sending it has read it themselves. Based on their life choices, I doubt it.

Some are about people I have never met and never will. Some are complicated with slang and abbreviations I don’t recognize.

I like as much of it as I can, I comment when appropriate. I support different journeys.

I realized when I looked at this that I have been backing my friends and family’s internet, Facebook, Instagram, and maybe Linked In for years. I did a calculation starting in 2008 when I joined Facebook. If someone sends me something every day (365) for a year and I look at it for 20 seconds, that is 17 years of involvement. If you do the math, that is about 2,000 hours I have spent supporting this one person.

I am not a big poster on social media. I might post an NBA finals result or a World Series shout-out if my team wins. I am not too motivated to have a big digital footprint. But I do have these causes I support, these ideas I think should be explored. That is the footprint I like to leave. And it isn’t always as simple as the cat with the doughnut. It takes some energy to digest. But by my calculations, I have accumulated money in the bank for all these restaurant meals and pictures of the dog that I have liked.

This brings me to the title of the article, Run Your Game. This is slang for confidently pursuing your objectives. It also means some other things but here it is just that. I am asking writers not to back down when people complain they are wordy. Don’t apologize for having a voice and using it.

Find your audience and speak to them. Pour your heart out about whatever is in your grill on a given day. If some people are not interested, grudging in their comments, even critical and looking for an argument, decide whether they should be in your world.

This is your footprint, and it will be there long after the cups of coffee are finished and the latest TikTok challenge is over. They are your history.

There are more than 8 billion people on the planet and if one person wants to go in a different direction than you are going, let them. Don’t let their comments or lack of them stop you from speaking up when you feel the urge.

If every artist stopped painting, and every writer stopped writing because it was inconvenient to someone, the world would be a gray and dreary place.",1,1737035032.0,freelanceWriters,5,1.0,False

Lately I've been trying to call more often to appease her, but this is how every phone call goes.

Mom: what have you been doing for fun the past 2 weeks?

Me: Not much, we've been working a lot so on our weekends we like to just relax. I started a new book, we went to see a movie, nothing crazy.

Mom: that's ridiculous, I'm old and living vicariously through you, you should be out doing fun things! Your father and I just went to XYZ event!

Me: we're tired from working full time, what did you and Dad do when you were our age?

Mom: oh god nothing, we were too tired from working all of the time. But you should be doing more!

  
\*cut to later in the conversation when we're talking about finances\*

Mom: well if you went out less and saved more, you'd be able to buy a house. you need to stop getting coffee and going out to eat! Stop going to the movies!

  


Also in the same conversation, she fully read all of my brother's texts about the LA fires to me....as if I'm not in the group chat that he sent them to....The group chat that is just the 3 of us to begin with....

France! The land of charming villages, breathtaking landscapes, and delectable cuisine.  But beyond the postcards, lies an opportunity to travel ethically and sustainably, ensuring your trip leaves a positive impact.  This guide will help you navigate responsible adventures in France.

**Understanding Ethical and Sustainable Travel:**

Before we dive into specifics, let's clarify what ethical and sustainable travel means.  It's about minimizing your negative impact on the environment and local communities while maximizing positive contributions. This includes:

* **Respecting local cultures:** Learning a few basic French phrases, understanding local customs, and supporting local businesses are key.
* **Protecting the environment:** Reducing your carbon footprint, minimizing waste, and choosing eco-friendly accommodations and activities are essential.
* **Supporting local economies:** Spending money at locally-owned businesses, choosing locally-sourced food, and employing local guides directly benefits the community.


**Planning Your Ethical and Sustainable Trip to France:**

**1. Choosing Sustainable Transportation:**

* **Train travel:** France boasts an excellent train network.  High-speed trains connect major cities quickly and efficiently, reducing your carbon footprint compared to flying.
* **Regional trains and buses:** Explore smaller towns and villages using regional transportation. It’s a slower pace, but you'll see more of the country's charm.
* **Cycling:**  Rent a bike and explore the countryside at your own pace. Many regions offer well-maintained cycling paths.
* **Walking:** Embrace the pedestrian-friendly streets of many French towns and cities.


**2. Eco-Friendly Accommodation:**

* **Eco-lodges and guesthouses:** Seek out accommodations with sustainable practices like renewable energy use, water conservation, and waste reduction.
* **Farm stays:** Immerse yourself in rural France while supporting local farmers and experiencing authentic life.
* **Airbnb:** When using Airbnb, prioritize listings that highlight sustainable practices.


**3. Responsible Activities and Experiences:**

* **Support local guides:** Choose guided tours that employ local guides who know the area intimately and share their cultural knowledge.
* **Choose ethical wildlife experiences:** Ensure any wildlife encounters are respectful and prioritize animal welfare.  Avoid activities that exploit animals.
* **Participate in eco-tourism activities:** Look for opportunities to participate in activities like forest restoration projects or beach cleanups.


**4. Minimizing Your Environmental Impact:**

* **Reduce your waste:** Carry a reusable water bottle, coffee cup, and shopping bag.  Avoid single-use plastics.
* **Conserve water and energy:** Turn off lights and air conditioning when leaving your room.  Take shorter showers.
* **Offset your carbon footprint:** Consider purchasing carbon offsets to compensate for your travel emissions.


**5. Respecting Local Cultures:**

* **Learn basic French phrases:**  Even a few simple greetings show respect and enhance your interactions.
* **Dress modestly when visiting religious sites.**
* **Be mindful of local customs and traditions.**
* **Support local businesses:** Opt for locally-owned restaurants, shops, and markets.


**Beyond the Tourist Trail:**

Venture beyond the usual tourist hotspots to experience the authentic charm of France and support smaller communities.  Explore less-visited regions, discover hidden gems, and interact with locals to get a richer understanding of the French culture.


**Making a Difference:**

Ethical and sustainable travel in France isn't about sacrificing enjoyment; it's about enhancing your experience by engaging meaningfully with the country and its people. By making conscious choices, you can ensure your trip leaves a positive impact and contributes to preserving France's beauty for future generations.  Bon voyage!

1i2p4w6,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1i2p4w6/one_only_cape_town_review_january_2025/,One & Only Cape Town Review | January 2025,"Hey friends, excited to get back into posting more reviews in 2025 as our travel ramps back up post-holidays! Full disclosure, this stay was done by a wonderful member of my team named Sarah. Not to be confused with u/sarahwlee, who in fact has a member on her team named Alex (different Alex than me) - so it's really just quite a mess and we may need to rename everyone here soon lol.

My last visit to OO Cape Town was in 2022 so it's been a minute and I was thrilled to get Sarah in for an updated stay. As I aim to visit more properties more often - I can't physically get to all of them. I will have members of my team going one place while I go to another, bringing you reviews from all over the world at once :). Sarah was around South Africa the past week+ scoping out spots and I'll be in Turks & Caicos for the long weekend going to visit: The Palms, Amanyara & Grace Bay Club. After that I'll be heading to Bora Bora for Four Seasons Bora Bora & The Brando in a couple weeks.

**Where we went**: One & Only Cape Town

**When we went**: January 2025

**Who went**: Couple (Sarah & her husband)

**Room type**: Marina Table Mountain Room

**Overview**: One & Only Cape Town is a property for those looking to bop around in the mix of the city while still having a luxurious retreat at the end of the day. Historically I've promoted Ellerman House (also stayed on this trip, review coming soon), tbh it's still my favorite. I love the picturesque cliffside location and understated vibe when you drive up, not knowing that just beyond the gates is this spectacular, perfectly renovated yet authentic, ultra-private mansion. Plus I'm a REAL sucker for the snack room - last time I was there I skipped two meals in favor of the snacks. However, in 2025 I'm trying to expand my repertoire because obviously there are many great hotels in CT and some people do want to be in the city. And so that is how Sarah's visit to O&O CT came to be! PS - we are still working on our photo taking skills so mixed in here are some of Sarah's pics and some from Kerzer. I'll label where relevant. The really profesh photo's are Kerzer's lol.

**Property**: 9/10  
*The entire property was renovated starting in 2022*

Forming the backbone of the property is the Marine Rise building. With 91 rooms & suites along with the main entrance, lobby and restaurants, this is the central hub of the property. While the exterior of the building is fairly unremarkable, once you walk into the main lobby, the majesty of Table Mountain overwhelms you as you take it in through enormous floor to ceiling glass windows. As the mountain rises beyond the grounds of the property, any fleeting thought of the lackluster exterior is long gone. This natural wonder of Cape Town is truly breathtaking. I’ll say, this is where O&O has Ellerman House beat. 

[Pre-reno](https://preview.redd.it/vmowegj9zcde1.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=82bead5f65a03b8d774f794269658399887c456d)

In front of the Table Mountain view is the circular lobby bar which has a beautiful sculpture by the artist, Trzebinski. This sculpture depicts the local legend, ""The Watchers."" According to the legend, Table Mountain is one of four Watchers, giants of natural form created by Mother Earth to protect the land from the Great Sea Dragon. The view of this sculpture with the mountain behind is really quite special.



[Kerzer photo](https://preview.redd.it/vsxt79wqzcde1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=990afe5df7e9e5b3dc3f2cb955ac04028c285fb0)

Beyond the lobby lies your first glimpse of the manmade islands of the property. These islands are One & Only's way of bringing local nature back into the resort. As many of you may know, central to O&O's design ethos is creating a sense of place that is not only culturally relevant, but just as important, provides a tribute to the natural environment of the destination. While this property is in the midst of the city, they have brought elements of the original nature back through these islands. The lush, over planted land feels more like a garden oasis than a hotel. As soon as you step foot outside Marine Rise you can hear the call of birds unlike anything you're used to in a city property.



[Obviously a Kerzer photo lol](https://preview.redd.it/a7mb8qzszcde1.png?width=2254&format=png&auto=webp&s=064525421041bdf838a9a7918b4d3fed2b0718e3)

While the Marine Rise building may feel more like a city hotel, the islands are where everything changes. As you head toward them, you are enveloped by near forest cover - and it's with this that you're able to forget, if only briefly, that you're in the middle of a bustling city. The islands are home to the spa, pool and 41 rooms. The infinity pool is a highlight and since it's heated, it can be enjoyed year round.

https://preview.redd.it/2tbfik1yzcde1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d197ab3d313fe7950ad9a1bb98a22da975e987c8

The reason I'm giving the property an 8.5 not a 10 is twofold

1. While the islands are lush and beautiful, I do feel parts of the exterior to the Marina Rise building feels starkly less lush and so some of the beauty and integration is lost there.
2. In my experience, One & Only is uniquely successful at integrating the local aesthetic and art into their design ethos to create a property that feels authentic while maintaining the calm and chic One & Only retreat experience. But for some reason, certain pieces of the common spaces within the Marina Rise building doesn’t execute this as flawlessly as some other properties and feels a bit frenetic. I don’t pretend to be a design critic, and if you saw the interior of my home you’d be appalled, but it’s something about the mix of colors, patterns and materials that doesn’t feel as serene and elegant as many of the other OO properties. Locations like OO Mandarina and OO Gorilla's Nest are able to imbibe the local aesthetic and blend it with their unique design eye to create a soothing and chic yet entirely authentic sense of place. I just don’t feel that with OO Cape Town. 

**Rooms**: 8.5/10

[Sarah photo](https://preview.redd.it/ixuy1d2zzcde1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e389c67caf75496cc6301e086a6c9f48e5ac7dd)

The property was completely renovated in 2022 - all 132 rooms were renovated. 91 of those rooms are in the Marina Rise building and 41 are on the island. The Marina Rise rooms were designed based on the raw beauty of the mountain, with earthy tones and textures.

The island rooms are all designed based on the ocean - so more blues. They have a view of the water surrounding the island and some have a view of the Marina Rise building. While the island rooms are entirely relaxing and tranquil, in terms of views, you don't see much of Cape Town so you really could be anywhere. Whereas the Marina Rise building offers those sweeping views of Table Mountain.

The rooms are well sized for a city hotel. Like many OO's the layouts are great and use the space well. A large number of rooms don't have great views so that's why the lower rating.

**Service**: 7.5/10

* This is where things aren't as great.
* While all the staff are very friendly, welcoming, and there was amazing service everywhere we went  within the hotel, there were some hiccups on the service side of things to be aware of.
* The room cleaning and service seemed to be a bit clunky at times
   * A garbage bag was left in the room after the attendants came on the first day. Sarah moved it out of the way by the door to be taken the next time they came but it was left again.
   * There was a big ring mark (the size of a dinner plate) on top of the coffee counter that was sticky when they arrived , so it hadn’t been cleaned / wiped down from previous guests
   * They had 2 occasions where the do not disturb sign was on, but they rang the doorbell for the room - one of the occasions it was for a delivery but was for the wrong room, and the  second time they rang twice before leaving (we think it could have been for turn down  service, but the do not disturb was on).
   * With the cleaning and do not disturb sign issues, it did feel slightly clunky in service, but the staff  were so nice and helpful when you needed something. Would just be aware of it, and let guests  know what to expect.

**Food & Restaurants**: 

* **Rooi** \- just completed the renovations. This is where breakfast will be served in the mornings. Incredible view of table mountain, especially for the outdoor seating.  Breakfast is a full buffet daily from 6:30-11am. Rooi also offers dinner - more focused on South African cuisine cooked by fire.
* **Nobu** \- the only Nobu in Southern Africa. Recommend booking a table in advance, but  they do try to keep a few tables each night for in-house walk-ins.
* **Isola** \- Mediterranean poolside restaurant available daily during summer months. It is  generally closed from around May-October each year. During winter months, the in-room  dining can be ordered from the pool.
* **Vista bar & lounge** \- Amazing views in the heart of the hotel. A great place to go for a  drink or cocktail, they do offer meals as well. They have a popular afternoon tea from  2-5pm each day, recommended to be booked in advance. There is a live pianist during  the afternoon tea times daily, and live music in the lounge every evening.

**Extras & activities**: 

* Like all OO's, they work hard to provide a great Kids Club with dynamic programming",2,1737034829.0,chubbytravel,0,1.0,False

Occasionally I'll put some in my coffee at work but straight protein shakes or even trying to hide them in yogurt was just a straight up no go. I know Premier Protein had the prepared clear protein drinks but I've never been able to find them in stock. I was at Target yesterday for yoga blocks and stumbled across Oath Nutrition clear protein! They had a couple different individual serving trial packs so I picked up their coconut colada and blue razz one. I've so far only had the blue razz but I'm hooked-I have already ordered a big bag. It is slightly artificially, which I expected, but it's 20 grams protein per 100-110 calorie serving which is easy to fit in to my daily budget. Out of 10, I'd rate the blue razz 8/10. 

They are whey based in case anyone is allergic or avoids whey, and it looks like a lot of their flavors contain coconut too. 

I'm not an affiliate or anything, just so happy to find a protein powder option that works for me that I wanted to share! If anyone else has recommendations for other clear protein drinks options I'd love to hear them!",3,1737034805.0,PetiteFitness,1,0.8,False

I realized so many people have profiles that say nothing and I mean tell Me nothing about them. I get so many matches on bumble and hinge. Tinder was overwhelming. So I switched my accounts up with different approaches and while my pictures are eye catching. My prompts are incredible conversation starters. I realized that was the key.
The feedback is always you’re funny, are you sure you’re shy and so much. It’s been only 1/100 have I gotten unprompted sex*al remarks. 

You being an engineer or holding a fish or that mirror selfie or that one word, reply to a prompt doesn’t give much. 

I convered my face because I don’t know hahah but I just wanted to say I see y’all struggling and I wanted to give some tips based on my analysis. Look appealing obviously but make sure you think about how you wanna be portrayed .

Infact imagine a blind person was trying to get to know you off just written words. What would that be like?

If you spend a few minutes on that profile, swipe right, grab a coffee. If doesn’t develop further, you learned a thing and interacted with a real human outside the ethers. 
Make sure you mentalize your interactions! 

You might ask why I am still on dating apps? It’s because my city is a dead end and I am quite hard to stimulate mentally. But that’s beside the point.

* How can I create an automatic formula in column F that calculates the term remaining days based upon today’s date and the contract end date in column ‘e’?
* How can I create an automatic formula in column G that calculates the %age term remaining based upon today’s date and the term remaining days?
* I’d like to have the ‘action’ column (K) updated based on the actions in the key below, which should be determined by conditional formatting applied to column G and column J. What formula could I use to do so?

1i2ovt4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i2ovt4,Budget Friendly Options (Reviews),"I have seen a lot of beginners like myself asking for recs in here for some more budget friendly options for markers etc and I figured I'd share my thoughts on the ones I've grabbed!

Water-based Markers: I was lucky enough to already own a good chunk of Tombow markers prior to jumping back into the hobby and while pricey, they are worth it for the blending capabilities imo. Michaels usually also has them on some kind of sale which helps with price too!

I also, however, grabbed a set of 120 by Taotree on Amazon ($26) to split with my kiddo (who saw me jumping in and wanted to use my nicer sets.) They swatch well, dry time isn't bad and on cardstock they don't cause any curling/page changes thus far. They layer decently but blending isn't great on these. These are brush/fine dual tips.

They come in a plastic carrying case with drawer like trays (you can take them fully out also) and while it doesn't look fancy, at least (horizontal) storage is included. The downside, for me, is they are not at all numbered or named, I'll have to do that myself somehow. 

Alcohol markers: I know how popular Ohuhu are and while I'll probably make the jump later on (if I stick to the hobby haha) I know they're out of budget for a lot of us. Even some of the more popular brands rec'd here were a bit more than I wanted to spend on something that might be a passing phase.

I grabbed the 120 set by Jack Brown on Amazon for just under $30! (Chisel and fine dual tips.) They swatch beautifully, blend well and layer well too. Unlike some of the cheaper brands, they have bases in the bag for them to sit in which is lovely and makes organizing them easier as well with no need for a separate storage solution.These are numbered and named! My only personal gripe is that I feel the purple tone options are seriously limited and being my favorite color, that is a bummer. As far as I saw, too, they don't have any larger sets than this one. 

Acrylic Markers: I snagged a 30 color set by Tanmit ($10) that are brush/fine dual tips. These are numbered and named, but numbers only on the markers themselves. They swatch well and go on well enough too, though they need to be a little layered/stippled to get good coverage with the white at least. They do take a bit longer to dry. And the fine tips aren't super fine. They do have some metallic shades in there though!

Gel Pens: I couldn't justify the price of Sakura Gelly Rolls yet at all, even just for a small pack of white. So I grabbed a 120 set by ShuttleArt on Amazon ($18.) Might have been a little overkill size wise (you could absolutely get one of their smaller packs) but sharing them with kiddo also. They swatch well, although I didn't pick up on the glitter ones easily during swatching which was a bummer. They appear a bit better during use. These take a bit to dry and can come out really wet/creamy and unfortunately prone to smudging if you don't let them dry properly. 

These aren't numbered, I don't think any really are? But they come in plastic bags/cases with a cloth stretchy band to keep them together and are easy enough to organize that way and store. They have regular, neons, neon glitter, glitter, pastel, metallic and a few ""swirl"" ones but those didn't really change color unless you use them more/in a bigger space I imagine.

But the white one does fairly well! You might have to do a few passes to get the same crispness of a Gelly Roll, they dry more opaque than they go on for sure. Overall I'm happy with them for the price point and for now. 


I hope this helps a bit! I know looking at both the many options on Amazon etc plus knowing the pricey options are better or just feeling the fomo of not having them can get to you but you can definitely start out cheaper and still have wonderful results! :)",8,1737034079.0,Coloring,3,1.0,False

What occured to me is that Dr. K mentioned that willpower and Attention are actually one and the same thing.

So my to original post, i will slightly add/change:

When you focus your attention on finding little things, that you dont know about, they may spark your curiosity about a boring activity. When that curiosity kicks in and you start finding more and more little unknown interesting stuff, PULL mechanism of your curiosity will drive your Activity towards that topic.

No more need to PUSH through things with your willpower. It will only push your Activity towards things that spark your interests more than what you have to do, making you guilty in the process.

No more drained mental battery of constant PUSH ing.

Maybe, juuuust maybe, no more ADHD medication? No more coffee needed? No more nicotine? I dont know. What do you guys think?

And it all starts with sitting still on your ass and NOT pushing.

Yo, fellow music enthusiasts and creators! Let’s talk about music production—the ultimate blend of nerdy science and uncontrollable magic. Whether you’re in your bedroom with a laptop that sounds like it's doing cardio or chilling in a studio with gear that looks like a scene from *The Matrix*, music production is that rare mix of chaos and beauty that turns *vibes* into an actual thing you can listen to.

So, what's the deal with producing music? Let me lay it out for you:

- **It's Art Meets Science:**  
  You’re juggling the feels while also figuring out why your kick drum is hiding in the mix like it's scared of commitment. You can spend hours obsessing over grain-delay settings just to craft that *perfect* moment of euphoria—and when you nail it, it’s like crackling electricity running through your veins.

- **Every Producer's Secret Weapon: Starting Small**  
  Nobody wakes up on day one like, ""Hey, time to be Rick Rubin."" Forget the intimidating tutorials with 80 layers of automation. Start simple! Choose a solid loop, toss in a bassline, and gradually spice it up. It’s wild what creativity flows when you stop overthinking.  

- **Imposter Syndrome? Yep, That’s a Thing for All of Us.**  
   Think your beats are trash compared to what Tyler, the Creator is cooking? Welcome to the club! But here’s the thing: the guy you idolize probably had the exact same feeling. It’s normal—but don’t let it stop you. Just keep crafting… eventually, *everyone* finds their sound.

Let’s face it: music production gives us those “Why am I even doing this?” moments **daily.** But it also gives us the most epic “Wait… did I just create that?” highs. That rush when your kick finally hits “just right” (I’m looking at all you EQ warriors)… you can’t bottle that feeling, can you?

### Here’s Some Bite-Sized Wisdom from the Trenches:

- *Forget Perfection.* Nothing is ever “done,” so hit that export button before you’re too stuck in your head. It's better to finish something imperfect than polish a 4-bar loop for eternity.
  
- *Experiment Like a Maniac.* Record yourself smacking a pizza box and throw some reverb on it. Sidechain a synth to your grandma coughing in the background of a recording. Sound design possibilities are endless when you stop playing by the rules.

- *Fallback Plug-Ins = Your Best Friends.* Learn your DAW’s stock tools inside-out before chasing expensive plugins. Sometimes the most fire track happens with just some EQ, reverb, and basic compression.

What’s crazy about music production is it mirrors life: messy, frustrating, kind of mystical—but totally worth it. You can spend an entire Saturday swearing at your hi-hats before finally nailing a drop, and yet, come Sunday morning, you’re hyped to start all over again. WHY? Because watching chaos slowly transform into something musical is downright addictive.

And hey, if you’re stuck on a track, here’s a little hack: step away. Walk your dog. Water your plants. Life influences music, so don’t sit glued to your screen waiting for inspiration like it’s Amazon Prime. That melody might just smack you upside the head while you’re rinsing a coffee mug.

Alright, enough rambling from me—your turn! Producers, what keeps you hooked when the process feels impossible? Got any weird tricks, funny stories, or proud moments to share? Drop them below—let's swap some creative vibes! And remember… those “off-key,” wonky ideas you didn’t think would work? They could be the next big *thing*.",1,1737033673.0,Songstuff,0,1.0,False
1i2oqqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i2oqqt/if_you_enjoy_miniatures_in_boardgames_perhaps_its/,"If you enjoy miniatures in boardgames, perhaps it's time to explore some tabletop wargames?","A lot of boardgamers that I talk to for one reason or another, avoid tabletop wargames but once they give it a try, almost all of them fall in love with it! It has nearly infinite number of miniatures, it has terrain building from scratch household items, which is another hobby in itself. It has light and complicated rules, it can be a 30 minute game, or a 6 hour game. You can play a solo mode, a versus game, and co-op game, or battles of 6 people! You can have battles on a 2×2 coffee table, and all the way to stacking multiple tables together to get a 6×12 epic battles. Below are VERY quick snippets of what the game is all about, as they happen to be some (but not all) of my favourite wargames. If you have any interest in them, I can write a novel about them, so ask away!


**1. OnePageRules (Fantasy or Sci-Fi)** - There are 3 games that I consider the gold standard when it comes to introducing new players to tabletop wargames. OnePageRules (OPR for short) is one of them. It has a free rule book (and a paid rules extended one) online that you can download and read. It even gives you free paper miniatures, so print away, glue them together and start playing right away! The free rule book is by far (by far) the lightest rules you'll get in tabletop wargames. Basic moving, shooting, fighting, powers. Consider it a Warhammer 40K XX-Lite edition. Can be played between 30-60 minutes for Skirmish games (lower model count games). You can have small battles of under 10 models per side, to huge battles of 50+ models with massive beasts and ships.


**2. Bolt Action (World War 2)** - Players that don't like Fantasy or Sci-Fi usually like WW2 games. Bolt Action just released their 3rd edition, and they also released a small starter set of 12 miniatures (6 per side) with a rules-lite book that just goes over the basics of the game and gives you 6 training missions. Sorta to test the waters to see if you want to play further. I like it because it gives you historical flavour before the battle so you know what is going on, and I can make an argument here that to a certain degree you do get rewarded if you try to follow historical tactics. In this game you basically have a certain amount of points to spend (just like in OPR) on your units, and it tells you from what tables you can pick to keep it historical. There are 100s (literally) of missions from official to fan made ones.


**3. Gaslands (Post Apocalypse Death Race)** - This is the third gold standard game that I can introduce new wargamers to. Essentially you head down to your local dollar store, pick up a toy car, and some robot. Cut the turrets and weapons from the robot, glue it onto the car, and you for yourself a vehicle! You essentially get your vehicle, see what weapons you want to attach to it based on how many points you have and start racing around a track while shooting at eachother. You can play in versus mode or team mode. A cool feature about this game is at the back of the rule book therr are templates that you need to use in order to move your car. Do you want to go straight? Or a sharp turn? There are templates for it. Also a lot of other fun game modes. I like the zombie one where you have to do everything i said, but also hit zombies for points.


**4. Frostgrave (Fantasy Link Tree Wizard Wars)** - If you're a fan of fantasy games, if anyone kind, this is a game that might be for you. You pick a wizard from different types of wizard schools. As you progress in the game, your wizard will level up, get new spells, stronger spells, and will cause havoc on the board! Over a period of multiple games. All of this is happening while your opponent is doing the same thing. But it's not just a wizard, you also can hire mercenaries to help you out. So you and your band are fighting your opooenent, while also fighting monsters that appear and also collect loot. 


**5. County Road Z (solo/co-op zombie survival game)** - This is what Zombicide would be if it was a tabletop wargame. You have... you... and you have missions. You have to rescue people, find food, send telecommunication signals, kill zombies, find weapons and ammo. All of that is going on while you also have to take care of your shelter. Do you want to start a garden? Get more food? Medicine? Beds for the injured ones. It's essentially two games in one. First part (95%) is the miniature game, and the last 5%, although truth be told that sometimes we did spend a lot of times on this LOL, and theast 5% is you figuring out what the heck you want to accomplish with your shelter.


**6. SAGA (high valume historical miniature battles)** - Vikings, Crusades, and Age of Alexander. You build your large army, and you go to war against your opponent. Not much terrain is used here unlike the previous games, and it's all about attacking eachother head on. Your ""rules"" all fit into a single sided sheet, and all you have to do is roll 3 dice, see the results, and combine these results into whatever allowable combination on the stat sheet. Each faction has their own sheet, meaning their own powers. And each faction plays a specific way, meaning that you need to lean into the strengths as much as possible. Find a person that plays SAGA and they'll never stop talking about it. It's a really fun game!


I can name probably 30 more games, however they become more niche, and has a higher chance of a miss.


Anyways, if you played any tabletop wargames, I'd love to hear about it. And if you're new to tabletop warbames and have any questions, feel free to ask!",0,1737033638.0,boardgames,10,0.5,False

This has been an intermittent issue since I started Zepbound but never to this degree for so long. I had colitis in November and I was prescribed Zofran then so I’ve been taking my leftover pills, which helps with the nausea, but I just want to have normal bowel movements again. 😭

I think I might have confused my body because I messed up and left my medicine out of the fridge and so had to throw out the last dose of a 4 week pack. So one of my doses was a week late because I had to wait until insurance would fill it again.

Imagine waking up to the sound of waves in a seaside villa or enjoying a quiet morning coffee on the balcony of a quaint village apartment—the possibilities are endless. Whether you choose to book through online platforms or directly from private landlords, understanding the nuances of each option is crucial.

# Understanding the Croatian Rental Market

Croatia’s popularity as a tourist destination has led to a diverse range of accommodation options. From historic boutique hotels and seaside resorts with stunning Adriatic views to private apartments in quaint villages, luxurious villas with infinity pools, and family-friendly campsites, Croatia offers accommodation options that cater to every style, taste, and budget.

Private apartments, known locally as “apartmani,” are particularly popular among tourists seeking a more authentic experience. These accommodations range from budget-friendly studios to luxurious seaside villas.

# Renting Through Online Platforms

Online platforms like **Booking** and **Agoda** have simplified the process of finding and booking accommodations.

# Advantages:

* **Convenience:** These platforms offer user-friendly interfaces, allowing you to filter options based on location, price, amenities, and guest reviews.
* **Security:** Most platforms provide secure payment methods and customer support, such as 24/7 helplines, dispute resolution services, and assistance with cancellations or refunds, offering peace of mind during your booking process. For example, **Booking** provides local offices in Croatia where you can seek assistance with complaints:These local offices ensure you have access to support during your stay in Croatia.
   * **Zagreb:** \+385 1 643 9292
   * **Dubrovnik:** \+385 20 642 525
   * **Split:** \+385 21 672 424
* **Transparency:** Guest reviews and ratings help assess the quality and reliability of the accommodation.

# Disadvantages:

* **Service Fees:** Booking through these platforms often includes additional service fees, increasing the overall cost.
* **Limited Negotiation:** Prices and terms are usually fixed, leaving little room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Misleading Listings:** While rare, some listings may not accurately represent the property, leading to discrepancies upon arrival.

# Renting Directly from Private Landlords

Opting for a private rental involves dealing directly with property owners, bypassing intermediaries.

# Advantages:

* **Cost Savings:** Without platform fees, rentals can be more affordable.
* **Personalized Experience:** Direct communication with landlords can lead to customized arrangements and local insights.
* **Flexibility:** There’s often more room to negotiate prices, check-in/check-out times, and other terms.

# Disadvantages:

* **Lack of Formal Agreements:** Without a formal contract, there’s a risk of misunderstandings or disputes.
* **Limited Recourse:** In case of issues, resolving disputes may be more challenging without a mediating platform.
* **Payment Security:** Direct payments may lack the security measures provided by online platforms.

# Legal Considerations

Understanding the legal aspects of renting in Croatia is essential to ensure a hassle-free experience.

* **Registration:** Landlords are required to register foreign guests with the local authorities within 24 hours of arrival. This ensures that your stay is legally documented and helps authorities manage tourism data effectively. It also provides additional safety measures for travelers, as their presence is officially recognized.
* **Tourist Tax:** A daily tourist tax is applicable, varying by location and accommodation type.
* **Contracts:** For longer stays, ensure a written contract outlining the terms of your stay to protect both parties.

# Tips for a Successful Rental Experience

1. **Research Thoroughly:** Utilize multiple sources, including online platforms, local agencies, and personal networks, to find suitable accommodations.
2. **Verify Legitimacy:** Ensure the property is legally registered for tourist rentals to avoid potential issues.
3. **Read Reviews:** Previous guest experiences can provide valuable insights into the property’s condition and the host’s reliability.
4. **Clarify Costs:** Confirm all expenses, including utilities, cleaning fees, and tourist taxes, to avoid unexpected charges.
5. **Communicate Clearly:** Establish open communication with your host to address any questions or concerns promptly.
6. **Inspect the Property:** Upon arrival, check the accommodation to ensure it matches the description and meets your expectations.
7. **Secure Valuables:** Inquire about the property’s security features and take necessary precautions to safeguard your belongings.

# Conclusion

Renting an apartment in Croatia can enhance your travel experience, offering a home-like environment and the opportunity to live like a local. Explore regions such as [**Dalmatia**](https://holidayvisitcroatia.com/regions/dalmatia-unveiling-timeless-beauty-for-travellers/) for coastal charm, [**Istria**](https://holidayvisitcroatia.com/regions/istria-croatias-enchanting-peninsula/) for its wine and gastronomy, or [**Zagreb**](https://holidayvisitcroatia.com/cities/zagreb-croatias-capital-of-culture-and-charm/) for a vibrant city experience to make the most of your stay. By understanding the differences between booking through platforms and private landlords, and by following the tips provided, you can make an informed decision that best suits your needs. Always conduct thorough research, communicate clearly with your host, and ensure all legal requirements are met to enjoy a pleasant and memorable stay in Croatia.

In my free time, I play guitar....but not well. I enjoy 90s alternative, classic rock, 00s emo plus a variety of other types!

And I can’t forget my awesome German Shepherd!

1i2omzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1i2omzr/the_truth_is_stranger_than_fiction/,The truth is stranger than fiction ,"I have been on leave since Christmas and with all the free time, I have been watching real crime stories back to back. Ranging from 48 hours, JSC Psychology, True Crime, Into The Deep, Coffee House Crime, Forensic Files, The Deadly Type, etc. 

It’s so fascinating how meticulous and thorough the investigations are in first world countries and how they make use of the tiniest little details to solve cases. From a car’s tyre print, strand of hair, a finger nail, a watch, a torn piece of clothing, a shoe print, bite marks. 
It’s so much more interesting than watching fiction movies and TV shows. Especially the ones that have been reenacted with actors and actresses resembling the exact victims/perpetrators. Such stories expose you to how evil the world we live in is and how you should not trust anyone, not even yourself. 

I also noticed the motive for a large percentage of the cases was jealousy (Motivated by love/sex) or greed (motivated by money). Which kinda confirms the theory that money and sex are the two currencies that control the world. And also how time is your friend. Some cases are solved even years after the perpetrators thought they had gotten away with it. 

Whoever said that there’s no perfect crime was on to something. You will always leave something behind that will eventually incriminate you, no matter how much planning you put into it. 

Makes me wonder if Kenya has such a forensic structure to help victims get justice. You know from a database of missing persons, to a database of wanted criminals, to the technology required to conduct tests on decomposed/mutilated bodies. 

If not, just imagine how many criminals are out here walking on the streets, boarding the same bus with you, living in the same apartment as you do, working the same job, even dating you! 

Anyway, stay alert. Stay dangerous. Notice any weird patterns in the people around you. And run at the first sign of danger. Ni kubaya huku nje! ",1,1737033307.0,Kenya,11,1.0,False

1i2ok0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1i2ok0f/unusual_cat_behavior/,Unusual cat behavior ,"I have a three year old male cat and lately he's been exhibiting some more strange behavior 

First off he will eat and chew on literally ANYTHING if I leave it out, I'm talking plastic, butter, cereal straight from my bowl, the list goes on. He acts like he's ravenously starving even though I feed him a recommended amount of very quality food and he's definitely done growing. I have to be so careful to put everything he could chew away

He's also gotten the habit of getting into and knocking over the trash, learning to open cabinets to chew on his bag of litter, chewing on the handle of my knives in the block, and for some reason going after my unused coffee filters? He's also a lot more vocal than usual.

He never did any of this before, but before he also lived in a large house with 7 people and a dog, so I'm thinking it's understimulation (getting a kitten in April so hopefully that'll help), but I've also heard trying to eat anything and everything can be a sign of thyroid issues so I wanted another opinion. 

(also I do play with him and he has two cat trees and plenty of toys)

“Well,” said Lucy gawking at the mansion from outside. “This is… *nice*.”

Alex carried Aiden’s unconscious body through the wide front door, which opened for them automatically.

“I can’t believe this actually happens in real life,” said Lucy as she stepped in.

“What happens?” asked Alex. He gently placed Aiden on the spacious center couch surrounding the expansive rectangular coffee table in the massive living room. He touched Aiden’s forehead and neck; he had a burning fever.

“Pretty girl runs into a billionaire in some random coffee shop, or a plane,” said Lucy. “I’ve read about The Billionaire Rancher, The Billionaire CEO, even The Billionaire Nanny… never a Billionaire Superhero.”

“It’s not mine,” said Alex. “It’s his.” He pointed the smartwatch at Lucy.

“No way…” she breathed. “That watch owns all of this?!”

“Apparently, yeah,” said Alex. “I only met him yesterday.”

“I’m not a watch!” came Clark’s voice through the watch. His blue ball exited the screen of the watch and was now displayed on the big OLED screen in the living room.

His voice now echoed from every speaker in the room. “I am…” He seemed to have paused to think, “…Clark!”

“This is just crazy,” said Lucy. “I’m not awake, am I?” She limped to the part of the couch across Aiden. “I need to wake up.” She crawled into the soft, cozy corner of the couch and instantly began snoring.

“She’s not dead, right?” said Clark. “Just asleep?”

“Yes,” Alex confirmed.

“Good,” said Clark. “Because I wasn’t a hundred percent when I saw you collapse like that.”

Alex wanted to ask how Clark was sure he didn’t need emergency medical attention, but he couldn’t speak. His body reminded him that he wasn’t fully recovered yet. He needed rest just as much as they did.

So at peace they were now. He wondered about the kind of horrors they must have survived through, together.

May they never have to again.

“You did good, Alex,” said Clark to him in a whisper through the watch’s speakers. “They are here, alive and well, because of you.”

Alex felt the corners of his mouth twitch into a smile. “What about the mutagens?”

“We’ll ask them tomorrow,” said Clark. “For now, goodnight!”

 

\*\*\*

 

“Arrrgggh! What the hell is this? Where the hell are we?!” came the shouts of a young man. “Lucy!! *Lucy, wake up!*”

“Shut up, Aiden,” Lucy responded drowsily, her eyes still shut tight.

“Lucy! We’ve been kidnapped by an alien puppy!”

Alex rushed to the living room. He had chosen one of the many bedrooms on the ground floor to sleep in.

The robot blob was on the same couch as Aiden, who was cowering on the edge of it. The blob was still in his monster truck avatar, but one of its antennae had transformed into a long metal tube with a mean-looking syringe at the end of it.

“Stay away from me!” said Aiden.

A blue ball blinked into existence on the giant OLED screen in the living room. “No! You weren’t supposed to wake him. Bad dog!”

The monster truck-puppy whimpered.

“Why would you scream so loud,” said Lucy in a calm, sleepy voice, “in the morning!” she screamed the last part. “I was having the best sleep of my life!”

“Lucy, there’s a monster robot!” Aiden pointed at the robot blob.

“Blob!” said Lucy. “Change form. Something cute and snuggly. Now!”

The truck-puppy tilted its ‘head’ to the side and looked at curiously at Lucy. A couple seconds later, it transformed into a bright blue ball with a smooth, shiny, liquid-like body. It now also had large round eyes which were bluer than his bubble-like form—something straight out of a Pixar-animated movie.

The blob turned at Aiden and extended his round blue ‘arms’ like a lovable sentient balloon.

“See?” said Lucy. “It’s completely harmless,” she said confidently, then backtracked when she obviously recalled the events of last night; “to us,” she added.

“Oh my…” said Aiden, his tone completely different now. “It’s adorable!” Aiden picked it up and hugged it tight. The robot blob had a faint red blush below each of his eyes. “I don’t care what you are, I will love you forever.”

*They were acting completely normal,* thought Alex. As if the past couple of days never happened.

Or maybe, their minds weren’t ready to recall the events just yet.

*It’s fine,* thought Alex. *Let them have their fun. Even if it is for a little while…*

“Oh, hey Alex,” said Lucy after she spotted him. “You sleep well?”

“Yeah. Pretty well, actually.”

“Oh,” said Aiden, getting off the couch and walking up to him. The blob floated in the air like a balloon let loose. “You must be Lucy’s date. I’m Aiden,” he said, extending an arm. “Thanks for letting us crash at your house.”

“*Shut up Aiden!*” Lucy said with gritted teeth, squashing a pillow lying nearby.

“It’s not like that,” said Alex shaking his hand. “I’m just a friend.”

“He’s the one who saved us, Aiden!”

“Saved us… From wha—? Oh.”

It all came crashing back to him.

“We were in that alley, weren’t we? I was… I was shot, wasn’t I?”

Aiden suddenly bent forward to look at his belly. His knees began shaking. It looked like he might collapse any moment—

Alex caught him before he hit the floor. “Easy now,” he said to Aiden. “Come back to the couch.”

“How?” asked Aiden. “I don’t understand…”

Alex carefully guided him back to the couch. Aiden looked like he was in shock.

“I’m… I’m not dead, am I?” he asked timidly. He looked like he was preparing himself for shock and disappointment, expecting the answer to be yes. “Is this like the afterlife?”

Lucy almost spat out the water she was drinking. “No! You’re very much alive.”

Aiden looked confused. He looked from Lucy to the floating blob to Alex. “How?”

“That’s what I’ve been wondering,” came Clark’s voice through all the speakers in the living room.

“Whoa what the hell is that?” blurted Aiden, spooked.

“Turn the volume down!” Alex told Clark. “And choose *one* of these speakers, please. It’s like you’re everywhere all at once.”

“Sorry,” said Clark, still blasting out of all the speakers. “This better?” he said, his voice now coming only from the giant TV, with his blue ball avatar back on screen.

“Who are you?” Aiden asked him.

“He’s an AI,” said Lucy.

They both replied together:

“He’s not an AI,” said Alex.

“I’m not an AI,” said Clark.

Lucy was confused. “If you’re not an AI, then what are you?”

“I… don’t actually know,” said Clark. “I’m just Clark.”

“Can you… um… do you have feelings?” asked Aiden.

“I guess I do,” said Clark. “I bet they’re different than yours though. But I can’t, for the life of me, get my head around how.”

“You sound so human,” said Aiden.

“I’ve been told,” said Clark with a virtual nod at Alex.

Aiden was lost in thought. He looked around the room and found Clark’s half-torn armor hanging near the workstation. “Holy shit is that your body?”

“It used to be,” said Clark. “It was destroyed a couple days ago.”

“Wait, no way!” Aiden struck his palm. “You’re that superhero who disappeared into the smoke screen, aren’t you?”

“The superhero…?” Clark’s invisible virtual eyes seemed to have lit up. “Yeah. I guess I am, yeah,” he said. “How do you know?”

“I heard those soldiers talk,” said Aiden. “They were waiting for you to come out.”

“Yeah, well,” said Clark with a hint of shame. “I didn’t survive … that engagement. At least my body didn’t.”

“He took out the main boss demon along with his entire demon army singlehandedly, while also destroying the portal from hell in time,” said Alex. “If not for him, the entire planet would be either dead, or enslaved, or something unimaginably worse.”

Aiden looked at the giant screen with pure awe. “You are incredible!”

“I guess we owe you more than just our lives,” said Lucy. “Thank you!”

“Please guys,” said Clark. *Was he embarrassed?* “I was just fulfilling my—” he cleared his virtual throat, “—never mind, enough about me. How are you two feeling? Do you still have a fever?”

“I don’t,” said Aiden. “I’m feeling better than ever. Like I woke up with a belly full of ice cream and berries. Berry ice cream.”

Alex eyed him curiously. Was he always this energetic?

*Wasn’t he shot like five times just yesterday evening?*

“I had a fever?” asked Lucy, completely surprised. “I feel fine.”

“You did,” said Clark. “My assistant-pet here cared for you all night.”

The blue bubble woofed from mid-air.

“Thank you,” said Lucy, smiling at the bubble. “I’d give you a treat if I had any. Or if you ate any.”

The bubble seemed to be absolutely loving the attention and praise.

“Let’s rewind for a second here,” said Lucy, turning to Alex. “Did you say a portal from *hell*?”

“That’s what that red lightning was,” said Alex. “If it had managed to open… Well, let’s just say I’m glad we had a guardian angel watching over us. Quite literally.” Alex thought of how poetic it was that Clark’s home was actually atop a cliff overlooking Sol City.

“But if it was a portal from hell,” said Lucy. “Shouldn’t we be looking at… I don’t know… Shouldn’t we be referring this to the church or something? Or maybe talk to some experts of the occult?”

“I don’t know how that’d help,” said Alex, confused. “They weren’t those kinds of demons.”

“What do you mean?”

“They come from the Demon Worlds,” Clark explained. “It’s a group of planets in a dark quadrant in our galaxy, quite far from here.”

“But weren’t they opening a *portal*?” asked Lucy. “If they were on the same dimension as us, wouldn’t they just use a spaceship to get here?”

Alex wasn’t sure how to respond to this. “They did use a space ship to get out of here. But… I don’t know.”

“They use portals to close great interstellar distances in practically no time,” Clark explained. “It’s a common tactic they use to take an unprepared planet completely by surprise.”

“So they come from space?” asked Lucy.

“From a part of our galaxy commonly referred to as the Demon Worlds, yes,” said Clark. “Although I think the League itself is more accurately a tribe of nomads.”

Lucy looked even more confused than before.

“See?” said Aiden. “I told you there’d be a rational explanation.”

“They’re opening portals to get from their worlds to ours,” said Lucy. “How is that any different from what I had said? How is it different from the scary stories Grandma used to tell us?”

“Again, I don’t think they’re that kind of demons,” said Alex. “They’re more like an alien species.”

“I don’t know though,” said Clark. “It is entirely possible that historic human civilizations on Earth may have at some point come in contact with space-faring demons, and made interpretations of their own. There are so many references to demons and demonic creatures in ancient folklore, across cultures and modern boundaries. The evidence is overbearing.”

All four of them sat in complete silence for a full minute trying to wrap their heads around the implications of all this, while the blue bubble continued to merrily float around.

Were the demons from ancient folklore the same as these space-faring demon pirates?

How much of an influence have they had on human history and culture?

Where had they disappeared to? Why were they back now?

Alex knew no one here had the answers to that. “You guys hungry?”

“Starving,” said Aiden, eyeing the fruit basket on the coffee table greedily, which was only filled with apples.

Alex suspected that the robot blob must have collected all the apples he could from nearby trees before any of them were awake, but didn’t gather any other fruit. Perhaps because it had no data as to whether humans ate anything but apples. It had even placed a large kitchen knife beside the basket.

“Didn’t you say you felt like you woke up with a belly full of ice-cream?” asked Lucy.

“I meant that metaphorically,” said Aiden. “I could eat a bucket now.”

“Jesus.” Lucy sighed. “Where does it all go, huh?”

Alex awkwardly shifted in place. Sibling dynamics was a foreign concept to him since he had always been the only child. His parents never let him mingle too much with his cousins either.

“I’ll just go see if I can find something to eat,” said Alex. He immediately realized he had no idea where to look. Was there even a refrigerator here?

*If yes, then why?*

“Clark?” Alex called to him. “You got something we can eat?”

“Sure I do,” said Clark. “There’s canned human food in the bunker going all the way back to the Second World War!”

“World War 2? There’s no way it’s still good.”

“It says on the packaging that it’ll never go bad, in a fun big font and bright colors.”

Alex sighed. There was so much about the human world that Clark didn’t understand. “That’s just false advertising, mate.”

“What?!” He was appalled. “Why would they knowingly write something false in such an important manner? That’s diabolical.”

“We’d sue if the manufacturers were still alive,” said Alex. “Guess we’ll have to make do with the fruits.”

“Or we can order take out,” Clark suggested.

“Are you out of your mind today?” asked Alex.

“Don’t worry they’ll never figure it out,” said Clark. “I’ve been ordering stuff online since forever. I just send my drones to the pick-up spots. They think it’s for some rich fat recluse staying somewhere in the mountains.”

“What if someone actually shows up to deliver in person?”

“That happened a couple times,” said Clark. “Even though I strictly selected drone pickup. Trust me, I’d remember if I did otherwise. But they insisted I selected the incorrect delivery options, damn them. Anyway, I just ask my assistant here to transform into a fat recluse billionaire to collect the package and scare them away.”

The floating blue balloon woofed once again.

“That’s wild,” said Lucy.

“Well…,” said Aiden. “All I heard was *pizza!”*

Clark chuckled. “That can be arranged.”

“Wasn’t it ice-cream before?” Lucy glared at Aiden.

“Yeah, well, that too,” said Aiden. “Pizza is food, ice-cream is dessert.”

 

\*\*\*

 

They quietly had their fill of food and dessert, ordered from a pizza place in a completely different city. Even though the inside of Sol City was an apocalypse, the world outside still functioned as normal.

Clark also ordered a fresh set of clothes for all three of them. He let everyone know that he values hygiene despite being a machine, while also explaining the nuances of machine hygiene to an inquisitive Aiden.

“I’m full,” said Aiden collapsed on the couch. “But I can eat more.”

“Classic,” said Lucy.

Alex was impressed. Despite not eating well at all in the past couple days, the pizza filled him up instantly.

Something felt off about Aiden.

“Are you sure you can eat more or were you just kidding?”

“No, I’m sure,” said Aiden. “In fact, can we go a second round?”

Alex looked at Clark concerningly.

“Of course,” said Clark. “Lucy how about you?”

“Tell you what,” said Lucy. “I wouldn’t mind a second round. Something heavier this time.”

Alex gulped. Their appetite was off the charts. “Say, um.” He cleared his throat. He didn’t want to seem offensive or make them feel embarrassed. “I ask this for a reason so please don’t take it the wrong way, but do you guys always eat this much?”

Lucy looked at Aiden. “He does.”

“What? No!” said Aiden. “I don’t eat a lot.”

“You once finished an entire large pizza by yourself!” said Lucy.

“Well, that’s not a lot,” said Aiden.

“You just finished half a large pizza.”

“That’s not true,” Alex cut in. “He actually ate a full. All by himself. And he’s still hungry.” Lucy and Aiden looked at each other weirdly. “Is that odd?” Alex asked them.

“Yeah,” said Aiden. “Yeah, I guess so.”

Alex looked at Clark. “Something’s up.”

“It’s got to be the mutagens,” said Clark.

Lucy reacted faster than a bolt of lightning. She was immediately in front of Aiden, shielding him in a defensive stance. She pointed the fruit knife at them, which Alex never saw her grab.

Alex was taken aback. The blue balloon ruptured a tear, chuffing air from its body and hiding behind Alex once it was out of air. It was just as confused.

“Look guys,” Lucy said in a careful tone. “We truly appreciate your help and hospitality, even though it was all for those glowing rocks all along. But let me make it clear, once and for all: We don’t know anything about them. We don’t know where we dropped them. And we’d like to leave.”

“You can’t leave yet!” said Clark. “We still haven’t talked about the mutagens.”

Clark thought he was being nothing but sincere and honest, but that tone didn’t land on Lucy.

“I told you we don’t know anything,” she said. “And we’d like to leave now.”

“You don’t understand,” said Clark. “We need to know about the mutage—”

“Clark, shut up,” said Alex. He immediately complied.

Alex carefully took a seat on the couch. He wanted to let Lucy know he was no threat. “We mean you no harm,” he said firmly to Lucy. “You can relax.”

“How do I know for sure?” Lucy asked, still waving the knife at them. “You telling me that robot won’t take us out if we try to leave through the front door right now?”

“Go ahead,” said Alex. “Clark, open the front door.”

“But Alex,” he protested. “What about the mutagens?”

“Just do as I say, please!”

The front door opened wide. The glass walls in the living room also retracted upwards. The robot blob took whimpered behind Alex. It obviously wasn’t scared of Lucy and Aiden. All the sudden hostility had upset him, like it would any normal dog.

“See?” Alex told Lucy. “If you want to leave, you can leave right now. But please hear us out first.”

“Why did you save us?” Lucy asked. “Why did you get us here? Is this a *quid pro quo*?”

“It is not, I assure you,” said Alex. “We got you here to save your life and nurse you back to health, that’s all.”

“What’s all this about the muta—whatever-the-fuck, then?”

“Mutagens,” Aiden corrected her.

“*Quiet*,” Lucy told him.

“The mutagens are the source of his power,” Alex explained. “They were scattered across the city when his body was destroyed. He needs them back, so that he’s ready to defend Earth once again from a future invasion. That’s all there is to it.”

Lucy’s facial muscles twitched. Alex’s sincere tone seemed to be working.

“What if I tell you we don’t have them?” Lucy asked.

“Then we’ll believe you,” said Alex. “And if you’re lying, we’d have no way to know. We’ll continue looking for the mutagens ourselves because they are important for reasons I already explained.

“Please,” Alex begged. “Relax. We mean you no harm.”

Lucy looked like she genuinely, desperately wanted to. But past experience seemed to have taught her otherwise.

She slowly relaxed her stance. “We don’t know anything about those glowing rocks. Do you believe me when I say this?”

“Yes,” said Alex. “I don’t think you have any reason to lie.”

“We found them—” She hesitated a bit before continuing, “—at least one of them, near the east exit. After the golden light shot up into the sky.”

“That’s it!” Clark jumped in excitedly. “That was me being split in two!”

“That was you?!” Aiden said excitedly.

“Quiet you two,” said Alex and Lucy together.

“You said at least one of them,” said Alex. “So you found more?” Alex obviously knew that they had. Clark’s receptors had picked up two blips. But he was trying to ease her into giving them the information on her own. Hopefully, this should help build back her trust.

And if she lies about anything, he’d know she didn’t trust them yet.

“Yes,” she said in a quivering voice, still sounding unsure whether to give Alex the truth. “We found one there and the other one near Darby Terminal.”

“You guys were running all over town,” said Alex. “Was something after you?”

“I’ll ask the questions now,” said Lucy.

“Okay,” said Alex.

“What does the name CalebGOD69420 mean to you?”

“The what now?!”

“The Boxing King!”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” said Alex. “I’ve never heard that name in my life.”

“He’s famous,” said Lucy. “The fact that you’ve never heard of him makes all this even more sus.”

“But you hadn’t heard about him either, Lucy,” Aiden blurted.

“Aiden, quiet!”

“Lucy,” said Alex. “I swear I have no idea who that is.”

Lucy studied his face carefully. “How did you find us?”

“We were tracking an energy signal from the mutagens,” Alex said. “Clark can read them. They were part of his suit once.”

“Oh yeah?” said Lucy in utter disbelief. “Then why isn’t he going back to get them right now? He can just send one of his pickup drones, can’t he?”

“Because they are already here,” said Clark. “Inside you.”

Lucy dropped the knife. “What?”

“That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you,” said Clark. “They’ve been absorbed. I’m almost sure of it. I wanted to take a blood sample from each of you earlier to confirm, but that spooked Aiden.”

The blue ballon revealed its long, syringe-ended tail.

Lucy looked shaken now. “Yeah, well, of course! You can’t just draw our blood without consent.”

“I’m sorry,” said Clark. “I didn’t know.”

The blue balloon puppy whimpered.

“This is crazy,” said Lucy, finally dropping back on the couch. “What do you mean they’re inside us?”

“The mutagens are meant for biological life forms,” Clark explained. “Not artificial ones like me. I can only draw upon the crystallized power contained within them. But only through a biological, carbon-based life form can they fulfill their true purpose.”

“Which is what?” asked Lucy.

“Genetic mutation.”

“Oh my god,” breathed Aiden. “Oh my god!”

“So what are you saying, then?” asked Lucy, struggling to remain calm. “You’re saying we’re some kind of freaks now?”

“No!” said Clark. “You’re the same as before, but also different.”

“What does that *mean?* Speak clearly.”

“The natural course of your evolution,” Clark began, “has been tampered with. Accelerated. It will take a toll on your physical body, the effects of which we’re already beginning to see now. Increased appetite, energy. Who knows what else is yet to come? I have limited information as to how the mutagens affect the human anatomy because the mutagens vanished from the face of the galaxy long before humans were even born. I’m only making guesses based on past data, which is why I need to analyze your blood.”

“Is this why he had a fever last night?” asked Lucy. She seemed to be missing the fact that she had a fever, too.

Missing? Or subconsciously blocking it out?

“Yes,” Clark told her. “I’m certain the mutagens are the reason. Behind your fevers, and behind how Aiden survived five magnum revolver shots.”

Aiden’s breath skyrocketed once again. “So I’m a… a *mutant* now?”

“Aiden,” said Clark in an urgent tone, “can you please explain to me, in as much detail as you can, what happened in that alleyway?”

“Well,” Aiden began, nervous, “we were running away from this… *gang*. We also saw a giant crocodile demon earlier—”

“Stick to the point, Aiden,” snapped Lucy.

“Right,” he said. “Lucy said we should rest in that alley for a bit while she checks whether someone’s following us. Someone was. I guess they were tracking us with a drone—”

“The drone was mine,” said Clark. “They were tracking you some other way. I wish I had one of my battle drones, then I would have shot that man down before he even got the chance to aim at you guys. But I’m sorry, I lost all my battle drones during the attack on Sol City.” Clark sounded upset again. “Anyway, Sorry to interrupt you, Aiden. Please continue.”

“Right,” said Aiden. “So the man was about to fire at Lucy, and I pushed her away.” Lucy squeezed onto a pillow once again. “He said he heard me coming from behind, but I think that was just an echo. Or maybe… I don’t know. Then, he shot me.” Aiden breathed heavily. “Five times. I don’t know how I’m alive.”

“What did you feel when the bullet connected with you?”

“I…,” said Aiden. “I don’t know. The bullets never hit me. I felt some pain, for a moment there, but I think that was phantom pain. There are no bullet holes. There was no blood. I think the bullets simply passed through me, because… I felt like I sort of… *glitched* out of existence every time I was hit.”

“Interesting,” said Clark. “Very interesting.”

“I was only able to wrap my head around it now,” said Aiden. “But at the time, I honestly thought I was dead. I know it sounds crazy.”

“Not now it doesn’t,” said Lucy. “You’re some genetically-enhanced freak now.”

“Where was the mutagen absorbed from?” asked Clark. “Not that it matters. You may as well have swallowed it.”

“I have a…” Aiden cleared his throat. “…a circular burn on my thigh. On the part that pushed against the rock in my pocket as we ran.”

“Where was the second rock?” asked Clark. “Was that in your other pocket?”

“No,” said Aiden. He nervously looked at Lucy. “That was with Lucy.”

“Lucy.” Clark turned to her. “Can you show us whether you have the same kind of scar on your thigh?”

Alex awkwardly cleared his throat. “You can go to the washroom down the hall that way.”

Lucy promptly sprang from the couch and sprinted toward the washroom. In a couple of minutes, she came sprinting back with a panicked expression on her face. “What the *hell* did you do to me?!”

“Is that a… yes?” asked Clark.

“That is,” Alex confirmed.

“I told you those rocks were trouble!” she snapped at Aiden.

“I told you we should throw them away!” he snapped back.

“Guys, please,” said Clark as the situation started to devolve once again.

The blue robot balloon, that had been cowering behind Alex all this time, sprang forth and landed atop the coffee table. He then donned the form of a miniature wolf and let out a deafening howl that lasted a full minute.

Everyone covered their ears, except Clark.

The message from the robot wolf was clear: *Calm down!*

All those raised voices bothered it. It just wanted everyone to get along.

“I’m sorry little wolf,” Aiden said to it calmly. He looked like he felt genuine guilt for upsetting the robot.

“So,” said Lucy, who had also clearly calmed down. “So what? Are we superheroes now?”

“Like you?” Aiden asked anticipatingly.

“If you want to be,” said Clark. “But first things first. I need to monitor you guys for a few days. Analyze whatever changes your body undergoes. Keep a log of your emotional states.”

“What do emotions have to do with this?” Aiden asked.

“Everything,” said Clark. “Isn’t it true that the mutagens were absorbed into your body while you felt great emotional distress, or upheaval?

“Emotions have a lot to do with evolution,” he continued. “You didn’t think it was a coincidence that the most evolved species on this planet also happened to be the most emotional, did you?”

Lucy and Aiden remained silent, immersed in their thoughts and wonder.

“Perhaps,” Clark continued, “it is emotions that make me so different than all of you. You can feel in ways that I cannot. You can see the world in ways I can never imagine.”

Alex could tell that all of this, too, was painful for Clark to admit.

“I was never meant to harness their true power, no matter how much I wanted to,” he said with a heavy voice. “But you… You guys might just be.”

 

\*\*\*

 

The gang stayed up chatting for a little while past that. All that energy that Lucy and Aiden felt in the morning was all but gone by dusk, and they were too tired to stay awake past 4 pm.

Consent was finally obtained to get their blood samples. Their bodies didn’t show any physical altercations, but Clark said they should watch out for those just the same.

Clark was expecting them to run fevers once again in the night to come, so Alex told him all about the proven home remedies that had always worked for him when he was young, perfected by his mother. Clark eyed him suspiciously when he did so.

The next day, a couple hours before dawn when the others were still asleep, Alex tip-toed to the front door. He was pretty sure that he was now cleared by the mansion’s security systems as a non-threat, so he should be able to open the door with ease.

It was just as he thought.

Alex carefully snuck out and closed the front door behind him, silently. He took a few steps away from the door and stopped to look up at the starry sky.

Did he actually want this?

*No. Of course* *not.*

He would love to just go back inside, wake up with the gang tomorrow, help Clark figure out what Lucy and Aiden's newfound powers were...

*Damn. That actually sounded so cool.*

But he can't, can he?

Every time he's tried to play the hero... something bad has happened.

And he didn't want that for anyone inside that mansion, artificial life form or otherwise.

He resumed walking in darkness. He decided that he’d turn his flashlight on only when he was past the estate grounds and deep into the woods.

However, he was barely a few meters away when the front door swung open and the porch light illuminated his back.

On the ground ahead of him, he could see a long shadow of what looked like a small dog bolting at him.

*Shit.* It had slipped his mind that those two never slept.

Alex turned around.

The robot wolf stopped a few paces away from him.

“You weren’t going to leave without saying goodbye, were you?” came Clark’s voice from a speaker on the robot wolf’s head.

“I was going to do it over the phone,” said Alex. “Or the radio now, I guess. It would’ve been too hard, otherwise.”

“Then stay,” said Clark. “You don’t have to leave.”

“I can’t,” said Alex. “I told you—”

“Yeah, yeah, I remember,” Clark cut in. He played Alex’s recorded voice back to him. “But I do this for you this one time. After that, I’m out.”

Alex shrugged awkwardly.

“You’re not cursed, Alex,” said Clark. “Whatever you did for those two proves that. They’d be dead if not for you.”

Alex felt his eyes swell. “I wish I had reason to believe that too.”

“I’m sorry if I said anything that offended you,” said Clark. “I cannot understand what you’re going through, and I don’t want to pretend that I do. But I wish we had more time to figure it out together.”

The robot wolf let out a sad whistle.

“Maybe some day,” said Alex, looking at both Clark and the robot wolf.

“The way you took control of that rapidly devolving situation,” Clark went on, “was pretty impressive. I need you here.”

“Don’t worry,” said Alex with a smile. “They trust you now. You’ll do fine.”

“And what about those two, huh? They seemed to have grown quite fond of you.”

“They’ll be over it in no time,” said Alex. “They barely knew me a few hours.”

“Something tells me that was long enough.”

Alex playfully raised an eyebrow at him. “Since when are you an expert on human interactions?”

“Fair,” said Clark. “Where would you go?”

“Back to the city,” said Alex. “Kenny’s in a hospital somewhere inside. That dude’s done a lot for me and I can’t just leave him there.”

“Didn’t Lucy say that there were demons hiding in the underground?” asked Clark. “Everyone on the surface is in imminent danger.”

“Which is precisely why I must get him out of there.”

“I understand,” said Clark. He then fell quiet, as though concentrating on something.

“Here,” he finally said. The watch on Alex’s wrist glowed blue. Alex was startled; he had forgotten to take it off. “I’ve installed a copy of the protocol I used to hack the robot dogs into it. Just point the watch at them from a stealthy position and wait about ten seconds. It should give you a ten-minute window to sneak past them.”

“Thank you, Clark.”

“It’s also a communication device,” said Clark. “Call for help if you need any. We’ll come racing down.”

The robot wolf woofed and wagged its tail excitedly.

Alex finally decided to pet him and the robot exploded with happiness. “Thanks to you too.” The robot wolf woofed once again.

“Damn curses,” said Clark. “I’m putting out an ad to recruit the best witches in the galaxy.”

“I don’t think it’s that kind of a curse.” Alex chuckled. “Or maybe it is, who knows. Maybe if I too become a superhero, it would go away.”

“Just say the word,” said Clark. “I still have one mutagen left.”

“No good can come from having power like that in my hands,” Alex said truthfully.

“On the contrary,” said Clark. “I can’t think of anyone better.”

 

Alex smiled. “Goodbye you two. And good luck with that ad.”

Side note I hate living in AZ and am hoping to move back to somewhere nice in the next 12-18 months. But I’d guess this something you can use with any landlord because it emulates a bank account? 

The rewards look like they’re pretty pitiful but that goes back to better than nothing and that I’d only be using it for rent and to set a reminder to buy a coffee with it on Saturday mornings - or maybe switch my subscriptions from Apple Card to it since Apple only rewards you 1% if you use the card number instead of Apple Pay. 

My medium/long term plans are to keep putting money into Apple GS savings for a replacement to my current vehicle and to keep putting money into my stocks for a down payment to buy a place when the market hopefully is better in 2-3 years and figure this might end up contributing maybe $800-1,000?

As I put my phone on the holder and started the car, someone started honking at me, signaling me to move. She wanted my parking spot, so, being my usual generous self, I started driving off without even thinking about what street I was turning onto—I hadn’t even had time to set up navigation.

As I was pulling out, a car came from the left, leaving very little room for me to turn. I ended up scratching the car parked next to me. Trying to find a safe spot to stop, I noticed someone running after me. Guess who it was? Yep, the Karen I gave my spot to when I didn’t even have to move.

I parked, went back to the scratched car, wrote a note, and took some pictures. But as I was leaving, I caught a glimpse in my rearview mirror of Karen messing with my note. I think she might have taken it as I haven't heard from the guy yet.

This week... it's different. I noticed that when we walk together to the kitchen to make coffee, he is nervous/anxious and laughs all the time at everything I say (which he never did before). I also noticed that if the kitchen is crowded and I come closer to him, he takes a step back to put some distance.

Now that I've stopped, I have so much more energy! I go for walks and coffee/lunch with no ticking clock in my head.

I'm so much happier being able to do the caring tasks I couldn't before because I had to hand over LO to go and pump.

1i2o3ds,https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1i2o3ds/sometimes_i_wish_i_didnt_have_a_birthday/,Sometimes I wish I didn’t have a Birthday,"I feel really shitty.

I have a weird relationship with birthdays. I say I don't like mine. People usually forget my birthday. My parents are either disengaged from my life or in their own heads. People always talk about self love and remembering that ""you are loved"" and everything but no one talks about how to reconcile with yourself if you're genuinely not. I am not loved. That is a fact. If I dropped dead tomorrow I guarantee you no one would pull up to the funeral besides my parents (they wouldn't miss me - it'd probably just be an awful reminder of how I was another strike in their ""life of failures"" - never living up to what they wanted). No one remembers me. I know I'm not the center of the universe and that everyone's busy with their own lives but it doesn't feel great to be an afterthought in everyone's lives when you go out of your way to try and make other people feel loved. I'm not angry or bitter, I'm just tired. Maybe I'm being too sensitive about this but I genuinely just want to be loved. Considered. Remembered. I know I should just develop a harder heart and not care whether or not others acknowledge me. I just feel so bruised inside. When you're the one that slips through the cracks again and again, sometimes you forget that you can catch yourself. Sometimes you don't care enough and become someone who can be thrown away. I know I need to get my problems sorted out and talk to someone about how my entire self perception is based on the value of how much others find me worthy but I genuinely can't fucking afford therapy. I know this post was rambling and pathetic, I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm sorry you've read this far if you have. 

TLDR (?): Happy birthday to me. I'm gonna spend today figuring out how to convince grad schools that I'm not a failure while pushing down my self loathing and buy myself a coffee from Williams I guess. ",5,1737031532.0,McMaster,3,0.86,False

Day 2 - Bamboo village to Kyanjin Kharka
Day 3 - Climb Kyanjin Ri and back to Langtang village
Day 4 - Langtang village back to Syaprubesi and bus back to Kathmandu 

Total cost (from Kathmandu and back) was $78 including permit.

Langtang Expenses

Altitude tablets + water purification pills + electrolyte packets = 200 rupees

3,000 (permit) + 950 (bus ticket) + 300 (dal bhat) +75 (cookies)

Who writes your code Popcap? These bugs aren't caused by spaghetti code, but because of wrong lines of code.
There are modders that could do better job. Even I could do this better and for free.

Also would be great if you informed us why were these changes implemented at least on some cards.
For example:
""We lowered applesaucer health because teleportation zombie couldn't one shot it and I am brainy main so f u.""

And remove draw a card from teleport, bullseye from teleportation zombie&make him 1/4, make all star 4/5 and shielcrusher viking 5/5 or at least fix quarterly.

Let's begin!

Almost all plant environments should cost 1 less.

Why?
You play red plant it and they cover it with trapper territory in the same turn.
That enviro cost 5 so you are probably dead if you play it and it gets covered or minion gets bounced or destroyed by trick.
On the other hand zombie 3 cost area 22 is just👌
Not to mention huge gigantacus exists.

Solar

Applesaucer:
3/2 (as 3/1 it's too fragile)

Sage sage:
1 cost (why it costs 2? When you have to choose between this and applesaucer what do you choose? Even 1 cost morning glory is better than this)

Cosmic flower:
2 cost (what is the reason for it to cost 3?)

Solar winds:
2 cost or make it do sunflower even if there is a zombie or at least make sunflower in front of the plant that's there not behind it

Sunflower seed:
2 cost or even 1 cost 2/1 (3 cost 2/2 that makes sunflower when dead?! It's basically worse primal sunflower.)

Chomper:
3/3 (right now it's 4 cost 2/2 that destroy zombie with 3 or less do I need to say more)

Venus flytrap planet:
3 cost

Petal metal:
3/5 armored 2 or 1 (just compare this to wing nut, at least make it durable sunflower)

Tactical cuke:
Also destroys environments (when you run theese you want to avoid ground anyway so why not)

Toadstool:
5 cost (6 cost 4/4 that destroys zombie with 4 or less and produces 1 sun next turn is on turn 6 understated af)

Cornucopia:
Same as now... BUT!!!
All plants get +2/2 after it fills lanes (it's really weak finisher when you think about it. 10 cost and it most times puts 1-3 cost cards in lanes. This should solve this issue)



Megagrow

Bannana peel:
1 cost (no reason for 2 cost)

Cabbagepult:
2/2 when on heights +1/1
(Outclassed by fire pea now it will at least have +1 hp if on heights)

Umbrella leaf:
Gain untricable (it will still die to everything but now at least trolling stone and yo yo plumber can't do final result of digestive system)

Sweet potato:
5 health (hey at least it's something)

Coffee grounds:
Cost decreased to 1 (90% plants die before doing second attack, vegetation mutation and invasive won't be op trust me;)

Black eyed pea:
1 cost (I stopped using it 2 2/2 just dies and do nothing)

Doubled mint:
1/3 (just do it!)

Cosmic pee:
2 cost, 1/1 (better synergy with pot father and dinos than todays 4 2/2)

Flourish:
2 cost (why it costs 3?! Same goes for raiser)

Moonbean:
Gain amphibious and bullseye

Muscle sprout:
Make it at least 3/3 or 2/4 (cmon 3 cost 3/2 that grows when you play something? Useless. Even in swarm decks is useless. This should be basic card not legendary. He will be bounced or removed by some deadly imp anyway.)

Red plant-it:
4 cost

Plucky clower:
4 cost, 1/4 , random plant gets +1/1 (average cost of event card is 3.27 so basically unreliable 4/4, conjure is useless most times so I added random plant get's +1/1 because this plants abilities should be luck based and what's more megagrow than +stat/stat)

Bamboozle:
5 cost, 4/5, Zombie tricks and environments cost 2 more plant evolution draw 2 cards (now this would bamboozle zombie players)

Super phat:
Make it do as much splash as it has damage

Kabloom
Toxic shroom:
2/1 anti hero 1

Shelf shroom:
1 cost

Blooming heart:
2/2

Banana launcher:
2 health gain bomb when played (dies to plumber, stone, cadet etc but now you will probally gain at least 2 bombs)
or at least give it 4 health (so it survives z mech sig, electrobolt and boogaloo sig)

Fireweed:
3/1 Immune to lava damage

Zapricot:
4/2

Velociradish:
1/4

Cosmic mushroom:
2 cost

Mushroom groto:
2 cost (pineclones wants you to make this)

Punishshroom:
3/2
Do 3 damage when shroom dead (cmon one of your mush-rooms must die for this)

Strawberrian:
when played and when another berry played do one damage here and nextdoor  (who plays strawberrian? I forgot this card existed)

Ringleader:
3/1 or at least 2/1 with same ability

Sourberry:
3 cost (2/2 that deals 1 damage to field really should not cost 4)

Pear paradise:
3 cost

Bluesberry:
4 cost (5 cost 3/3 that do 2 damage? when it's basically vanila with bannana bomb? Are you mad?)

Electric blueberry:
Make it do ability even after it dies in combat phase (most times it just dies and do nothing or give it 8 health)

Cherry bomb:
5 cost (6 cost is too much for 4 damage, kernel which is just 2 turns away can do it in all lanes.)

Guardian

Potato mine:
Do 3 damage (why would anyone play this no attack plant that needs to be destroyed to do something when almost any plant has 2 attack? It must at least counter conman on turn 1)

Primal potato mine:
2 cost 5 damage (turn 2 option without team-up, removes teleportation, if you think about it this is the only clas that can destroy it on turn 2)

Gardening gloves:
1 cost draw card (as it should)

Hot date:
4 damage

Spikeweed sector:
1 cost or at least 2 cost

Cosmic nut:
3 cost (can't believe it cost 4)

Forcefield:
3 cost

Guacodile:
When destroyed do 4 damage in this lane (can hit face when there is no zombie)

Prickly pear:
3 cost 0/10 team-up When hurt do 4 damage to a zombie here

Starch lord:
3 cost

Body gourd:
4/6

Soulpatch:
6 cost

Smartass

Lilly pad:
When played conjure a leafy card or make it 0 cost so there can be some lima-pleaurodon synergy (right now it's just a waste of card slot)

Spiris:
2/1 bullseye or same as now but zombies from ravestones get -1 attack

Snow pea:
1 cost 1/1 or 2 cost 2/3

Bog of enlightenment:
1 cost

Cosmic bean:
1 cost

Sow magic:
Shuffles 3, draw card (without that card draw it's too unreliable)

Chilly pepper:
Same as now but! When destroyed freeze a zombie here

Bean counter:
Same but all beans cost 1 less

Leaf blower:
3 cost 3/3

Witch hazel:
3 cost

Jumping bean:
3/4

Melon pult:
4/4 splash 4 (right now it's 5 cost 3 damage, outclassed by snapdragon)

Starfruit:
4 cost (nothing to see here just pass along)

Sap fling:
5 cost (have you ever played aganist this? Me neither)

Winter melon :
Freeze zombie you choose


Superpowers

Precision blast:
Do 4 damage to zombie or zombie hero  

Power pummel:
Do 2 damage to zombies here and next door (sounds like nothing but is actually huge! you see zombie played that cheesecutter on heights and arm wrestler on ground next to it? Now you can pummel em both. Same goes for water lane)

Devour:
Destroy zomb with lowest health draw a card or heal for 3 (yes sometimes it is good but on average isn't. Cmon wallknight has it on his much better uncracable)",1,1737031162.0,PvZHeroes,2,1.0,False
1i2nz9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1i2nz9w/critique_my_treatment_plan/,Critique my treatment plan,"Please critique my treatment plan and give thoughts. I have been dealing with hydrogen dominant (also tested positive for methane) SIBO for at least 3 years now. Symptoms are constant constant burping, bloating, alternate between loose stool and constipation.

What i believe my root cause could be:
It seemed to start after smoking THC daily in high concentrations for years. I believe it really slowed my motility. As well as I was drinking lots of coffee, skipping breakfast, getting fast food for lunches type of thing. Started to deal with constipation and hemorrhoids as a result and deal with more random digestive issues (I have been completely off THC for about 3months now but still seem to have slowed motility (alternate between loose stool and constipation) I also believe I am intolerant to garlic and onion. I can't even tolerate garlic oil. I am completely garlic and onion free but ate it for years just blaming digestive systems on other things. Despite being off of THC for about 3 months now and not having garlic or onion I still just have the same constant systems every day. 

What I am currently doing for treatment: 

1. Taking berberine complex 3 pills 3x/day (going off of Dr. Siebeckers protocol) and ADP oregano 2 pills 3xs a day. I am almost a week in and after 4 weeks plan on going to neem 2xs a day (was going to skip allicin since idk if the garlic will bother me). 

2. I am also taking 2 pills of NOW digestive enzymes with each meal. I was taking 4 pills of HCL but it was not even giving me heartburn or reducing symptoms so I decided to just try something different. Could the enzymes not be enough? Should I take more with each meal or just need to stay with everything for longer to give it a chance? It's been almost a week. 

3. Prokinetics: currently drinking ginger tea throughout the day and planning on buying Motility Pro. What is the dosage and timing I should take of this? 

4. I added a good quality multivitamin that has 100% of daily value of zinc since I read if you are deficient in zinc it can cause you to not produce enough stomach acid. I am also drinking 1/4cup of plain kefir to try to increase some good bacteria. 

5. Add I am also trying to eat low fermentation (low fodmap just felt impossible). So most either have rice or potato, a protein, and some vegetable and I have 1-2 fruits a day usually berries and grapes. Breakfast usually is one piece of Sourdough toast. I did make a separate post on what a typical day is in terms of meals. I would really appreciate advice on that as well. I need to get to a good point. !! I know people say carnivore but I just don't think I can do that. 


Please give me advice on how all this sounds. I really need to get rid of this once and for all. I am still struggling with constant burping, bloating, and just seem to be constipated. I am hoping the ",1,1737031134.0,SIBO,3,1.0,False

I woke up about an hour later in bed, covered in blood and one of my front teeth chipped. I had apparently seized and slammed my face against the coffee table, came to and without realizing gone to bed. I immideatly called emergency services upon realizing what had happened and an ambulance drove me to the emergency room to be evaluated. I got an appointment with a neurologist and for a EEG. The EEG didn’t show any signs of seizure activity in the brain so they were hoping that it was just a one-off. Yesterday at work i had another. My poor coworkers had to witness it and called for an ambulance for me. While in the emergency room the neurologist came to see me and told me that i was officially diagnosed epileptic and signed out anti-seizure meds for me.

# JAN. 15th, 2025~ USGS, DARPA, and ARPA-E called CriticalMAAS could deliver AI tools to solve USGS challenges

[Collaborative workshop spotlights machine learning to accelerate USGS critical mineral assessments | U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/news/featured-story/collaborative-workshop-spotlights-machine-learning-accelerate-usgs-critical)

[https:\/\/www.overtdefense.com\/2021\/07\/23\/darpa-autonomous-vehicles-and-rare-earth-minerals\/](https://preview.redd.it/ajnpa7ulkcde1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=be0c6f7637fa2837a4ee9032701b9866af8921e3)

Geologists and innovators from the U.S. Geological Survey, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), and other partners came together Jan. 13-17 to collaborate, train, and transition artificial intelligence (AI) tools to streamline mineral resource assessment workflows. 

The [Critical Mineral Assessment with AI Support](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/critical-mineral-assessments-with-ai-support) (CriticalMAAS) project set out to develop machine-learning tools to accelerate time-consuming parts of USGS data interpretation and critical mineral assessments. The collaborative five-day “hackathon” workshop served as a launch pad of progress for researchers and USGS users. 

**Graham Lederer, a USGS research geologist and lead for the collaboration with DARPA**, explained that the current process for mineral resource assessments relies heavily on staff-intensive data compilation and analysis.

“Typical mineral resource assessment will take us two years, start to finish, and that’s just for one deposit type, which may contain one mineral commodity in one area of the country,” said Lederer. “To assess 50 commodities across 100 deposit types throughout the entire United States would take many years to complete.” 

The challenge now becomes to augment and accelerate the assessment timeline from years to days.

Since February 2024, CriticalMAAS has conducted a dozen pilot critical mineral assessments, and the results have been promising, said **Erica Briscoe, DARPA Information Innovation Office program manager**. Hackathons have demonstrated the AI tools’ ability to reduce the critical mineral assessment workflow to two and half days, start to finish. 

A hackathon held earlier in 2024 reproduced assessments covering national-scale assessments of zinc, copper, and nickel. Another hackathon that took place at the end of 2024 pivoted to conduct regional assessments of regional Mississippi Valley Type zinc, magmatic cobalt and nickel in the upper U.S.  Midwest, lacustrine lithium, tungsten skarn in Alaska, national peralkaline and carbonatite rare earth elements, and regional and national porphyry copper.

The CriticalMAAS effort has four technical areas: extracting geospatial data from maps and documents; model extraction from knowledge; mineral potential mapping exploiting multi-modal fusion; and human -in-the-loop learning and mixed-initiative learning. 

“So far, we’ve automated the process for pulling data from maps and documents and then compiling the data together and making it analysis-ready,” said Briscoe. “The process is already moving much faster than expected.” 

AI-generated assessments would still need to pass the USGS’s scientific standards and peer review, where the fourth technical area comes into play. 

“Over time, we’ve built more precise and accurate extraction tools because of having human-in-the-loop,” said Briscoe. “This human element also helps create better training data and customizable tools for further specific applications.” 

Following the conclusion of the effort, Lederer says the goal is for USGS scientists to be able to take a usable product of the program and begin implementing it operationally. 

The timing of these tools could not be better, as the [USGS Earth Mapping Resources Initiative (Earth MRI)](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/earth-mri) is delivering an unprecedented volume of foundational data crucial to identifying resources of critical and industrial minerals, as well as other earth science applications. 

Earth MRI is a partnership between the USGS and state geological surveys that is revolutionizing our understanding of the nation’s geology and critical mineral resources, which are vital to the U.S. economy and national security.   

“These investments, both to Earth MRI and to CriticalMAAS, are setting the groundwork for future generations of earth scientists,” said Lederer. 

***CriticalMAAS was inspired in part by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Since 2021, BIL has advanced scientific innovation through a $320 million investment in the USGS-Earth MRI to better map the nation’s mineral resources. Through the end of fiscal year 2024, more than $198 million has been obligated for Earth MRI initiatives, propelling efforts to make once-in-a-generation advancements in the nation’s geologic and geophysical data collections and mapping.***

[Alaska and Northern Canada are rich in the minerals and metals essential for clean energy, high tech, and military readiness but are poor in the infrastructure needed to unlock these critical minerals. - \(Arid Ocean at stock.abobe.com](https://preview.redd.it/0m0h2etxlcde1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f51c6bbb2b1cdc811b06fc46daf7e0cb37eb253)

# Alaska and Canada's North poised to deliver in the 21st century.

As the United States wrestles to loosen China's grip on the global supply of critical minerals, there is a growing realization that Alaska and Canada's North host rich deposits of the elements essential to the energy transition, national security, and the overall economy.

Antimony and graphite in Alaska, platinum group metals (PGM) and tungsten in the Yukon, cobalt and lithium in Northwest Territories, nickel and uranium in Nunavut, and world-class deposits of copper in British Columbia's Golden Triangle are some of the highlights that barely scratch the surface of the critical mineral potential across the North.

Alaska and Northern Canada, however, are expansive frontiers that lie at and beyond the reaches of North America's transportation and energy infrastructure. This lack of connectivity explains why very large and high-grade mineral deposits remain undeveloped across this region; it also represents the largest challenge to unlocking the critical minerals potential at the northern reaches of North America's supply chains.

The limited transportation and energy infrastructure across the North is reflected in the most recent edition of Fraser Institute's Annual Survey of Mining Companies. While all five jurisdictions were ranked in the top 25% of global mining jurisdiction when it comes to mineral potential, Alaska and Canada's territories all ranked in the bottom half when it comes to infrastructure.

The challenges of developing mines in a frontier region known for its cold and dark winters also offer opportunities in an era when clean energy, emerging technologies, and everyday living are driving up demand for critical minerals.

""The North is often viewed through the lens of its challenges - vast distances, harsh climates, and small populations - but these very factors make the North an exciting opportunity for Canada,"" Northwest Territories Premier R.J. Simpson inked in an October column on unlocking the North's potential.

Policymakers, military leaders, and mining companies are becoming increasingly aware of the rich mineral opportunities found across Alaska and Canada's North and are investing in overcoming the challenges of unlocking the potential across this northern frontier.

[Alaska hosts 49 out of the 50 minerals deemed critical to America's economic well-being and national security but is lacking in much of the infrastructure needed to realize this mineral potential.](https://preview.redd.it/hfac1k09mcde1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=775a00009482d32a6e20b7666b7654d40fc04db6)

# DOD looks North to Alaska

From [Ucore Rare Metals](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/search/Ucore_Rare_Metals) Inc.'s Bokan Mountain rare earths project on the Southeast Alaska Panhandle to the world-class Red Dog zinc mine about 1,300 miles to the northwest, America's Last Frontier state is undeniably rich in minerals and metals critical to the U.S.

Analysis completed by Data Mine North identified 49 out of the 50 minerals critical to the U.S. in deposits and prospects across the Far North State. This largely untapped mineral potential has captured the attention of many Washington, D.C. decision-makers.

""We must end America's dangerous dependence on China for critical minerals, which are increasingly necessary for alternative energy sources, advanced batteries, and defense technologies,"" said Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan. ""Alaska can and will lead the way in unleashing America's resource potential.""

The U.S. Department of Defense shares Sen. Sullivan's concerns about China and has taken a keen interest in Alaska's critical minerals potential.

In mid-2023, the Pentagon awarded Graphite One Inc. $37.5 million to finalize a feasibility study for an all-American graphite material supply chain that would connect the world-class Graphite Creek project in western Alaska to America's burgeoning clean energy sector.

""This Department of Defense grant underscores confidence in our strategy to build a 100% U.S.-based advanced graphite supply chain – from mining to refining to recycling,"" said Graphite One President and CEO Anthony Huston.

The Graphite Creek anchoring this supply chain hosts the largest known graphite deposit in the U.S. and one of the largest in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

Future graphite mined in Alaska will be upgraded to battery-grade anode material and other materials at a processing plant to be built at a former national defense critical minerals storage stockpile site in Ohio.

A feasibility study that outlines the engineering and economic parameters of the Graphite One supply chain is currently underway.

DOD is also keeping close tabs on high-grade antimony projects that have come to the fore in Alaska.

""The antimony and other critical minerals found at Estelle has drawn major interest from the Department of Defense,"" Nova Minerals CEO Chis Gerteisen said when talking about the company's gold-antimony project in Alaska's West Susitna Mineral District.

Nova has identified high-grade targets at Estelle that have the potential to be quickly developed into small mines that could significantly impact North American supplies. Felix Gold Ltd. has identified similar high-grade deposits on its Treasure Creek project near Fairbanks, Alaska.

When paired with a central processing facility capable of upgrading the antimony to products for military and high-tech applications, the Pentagon sees these Alaska projects as near-term solution to America's heavy dependence on China and Russia.

""The company is working closely with various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense, to potentially receive grant funding for fast tracking the Estelle antimony production,"" said Gertiesen. ""The company believes its proposal applications already submitted for available grant funding will be taken under serious consideration, particularly in light of the recent announcement of China export restrictions.""

**Date:** Wednesday, December 11, 2024 at 8:11 AM  
**To:** Jim Sims <[Jim.Sims@niocorp.com](mailto:Jim.Sims@niocorp.com)\>  
**Subject:** Five Questions as we head into 2025!

Good Afternoon, Jim!

   As we wait with many....  I've gotta ask a few more questions leading up to a years end 2024 **REDDIT REVIEW** & the AGM! Rumor has it team Niocorp is in talks with the new administration as 2025 approaches. 

Jim - As 2024 nears an end- Trade Tariffs, China, Critical Minerals & a new administration are on deck. The table is set for Critical Minerals to take center stage.

1. *\*\*\*Are several entities such as (DoD, U.S. & Allied Governments & Private Industries) “STILL” Interested securing Off-take Agreements for Niocorp's remaining Critical Minerals (Titanium, Niobium 25%, Rare Earths, CaCO3, MgCO3 & some Iron stuff* ***as 2025 approaches?****) - Should Financing be secured??*

 RESPONSE:

***""Several USG agencies are working with us to potentially provide financing to the Elk Creek Project.  And, yes, we are in discussions with the National Defense Stockpile, which (like much of the USG) is much more intensely interested in seeing U.S. production of scandium catalyze a variety of defense and commercial technologies.""***

QUESTION #2) Niocorp has completed positive bench scale testing of magnetic rare earths from magnetic scrap. Is Niocorp now pursuing ""Pilot Plant studies at the site in Canada"" on the recycling of aforementioned materials? Could you offer comment on how that might continue.

 RESPONSE:

***""We have concluded all testing necessary at this time at our demonstration plant in Quebec to show the potential of our proposed system’s ability to recycle NdFeB magnets.""***

Also, the material news release above mentions the ""Fact"" Niocorp could utilize the new proprietary Separation methods now being undertaken for the separation of **(\*\*Other Feedstock Sources).**

 RESPONSE:

***""Yes.""***

QUESTION #3) Could Coal waste, or other mine feedstock sources be utilized. Please offer additional comment if you can do so on what ""Other Feedstock Sources"" might be in play? Or under Consideration from the team at Niocorp...

 RESPONSE:

***""Post-combustion ash from coal fired power plants is highly unlikely to ever become a commercially viable source of REEs.  There are a variety of other potential sources of REE mixed concentrate that we could possibly process.""***

 QUESTION #4) Is the New Trump Administration seeking to continue to build upon its commitment to mining the production & sourcing of domestic critical minerals? Comment if possible... 

 RESPONSE:

***""Very much so.""***

1i2nxq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1i2nxq7/update_1_i_39f_have_been_crushing_on_my_postman/,"UPDATE 1/? - I, 39F, have been crushing on my postman, 55M, for around a month. I think my feelings may be reciprocated given his behaviour, is it worth taking the shot? ","Hi all, me again! The majority of you were after an update, and from the overwhelming support from all of the comments, I owe you this one. I reckon there's a few updates yet to come, and thank you to the mods on this sub for being lovely about my situation!

Fair warning, this one is going to be a bit longer than the last post given I'm trying to encompass the happenings in detail, and that I just have a bit of a writing habit I need to curb. I'll do my best to break it up and to write a concise TL;DR at the end, but for all intents and purposes, the best details live within the paragraphs :-)

So, without further adieu, let's get into it shall we?

I spent the majority of my Wednesday morning on the 15th listening to my favourite soul vinyls from the sixties (regrettably, there was no Please Mr. Postman), working and intermittently doing laundry to make productive use of my nervous energy while I awaited his knock at the door, typically in the vicinity of 11:20.

The time had crept to 11:55 before my eyes flicked to check, realising that he was nearly 35 minutes out, my eyes darted up to the front window. There he was, letting himself in the gate, coming down the path smiling and waving, as though I manifested him into existence. It was here my collected manner and ability reason abandoned me like two scampering, squealing puppies.

It was probably the first time he achieved getting to the door before me for some time. I needed a moment to have a stern talking to with my nerves. I answered the door, and we exchanged our typical door chatter. He remarked how much of a relief it was the weather had improved after the recent prolonged ice age. I took this opportunity to offer that we go a walk after his shift, as I had nothing else on for the day and would rather get out with the dogs and chat a bit of nonsense with someone as opposed to letting such a rare appearance of the sun go to waste. He smirked, remarking that I must be awfully bored to want to head out with him, adding that he'd love to go out later.

We met for 2 p.m. at my place. Once we settled into the walk, I seized my opportunity to offer if he'd like to go for a coffee someplace with the dogs when we were both free later in the week. He paused, snickering at his shoes for a moment before turning his focus back on me. He questioned if I could read his mind, adding that he wasn't far from asking me the same question, but admitted he was apprehensive to in fear of the risk. We both spent the remainder of that walk looking like smiling numpties.

As the air had since developed a nip to it upon our arrival back to my house, I invited him in for a cuppa, to which we spent another hour gossiping over. Inevitably, my own nosiness got the better of me, I inquired if he had spoken to the colleagues he was friendlier with about me as they recently had made a few playful remarks at his expense, suggesting they knew something was afoot. He confessed he had, as they had taken notice of his insistence to deliver to my address, even if there were two posties working in the van together, which had earned him a thorough jabbing at work from those who caught on. He shared how surprised he was that they hadn't ratted him out to me. Once he had to shoot off home, we exchanged a big hug and exchanged numbers, later agreeing on the phone to meet at the localish estate grounds which had a lovely café for both human and dog towards the end of the walk after spending some time aimlessly wandering together.

I saw him again this morning on his deliveries as I was heading out to work, and we spoke at great length, long enough his coworker beeped the vans horn for him to get a move on, haha! 

I suppose I get to say I have a first date on Saturday late in the morning with him, it doesn't feel real yet. I am beside myself, and this week is crawling by now!

Thank you reddit for helping me muster up the courage. I reckon there will be a few more updates to follow this one!

TL;DR: You were all right, and as someone on here has said, it was really the worst kept secret in the village. We had our walk together and the feeling is mutual! We have a first date planned for Saturday 15th.",48,1737030979.0,AskWomenOver30,15,0.88,False

But she was also unnecessary to the show. When season 7 ended, and they introduced Rachel's pregnancy as a cliffhanger, I knew Friends had finally jumped the shark.

This led to some quirky and off beat moments which aren't fan favourites. The Joey and Rachel thing while she was pregnant was weird. The writers did handle this well...but then in season 10 messed it up again and shoved them together for all of two minutes even though there was an on and off emotional build since season 8.

Season 8's cliffhanger was also pretty whack with the mistaken proposal. I don't mind this story - it's actually quite entertaining, especially when Ross questions if he actually did propose - one of the best laugh out loud moments of the episode. But the dynamic with the whole Ross, Rachel and Joey thing, despite being momentarily interesting, didn't strike me in the ways it should have. Too many bonds were crossed, and our emotional strings were forcefully pulled. 

I would have hoped, ideally (especially since Ross and Rachel ended up together anyway) that Emma would lead to them starting their life together earlier, also giving them the time to adapt to parenthood, maturing and finding themselves in love again. A child could have revealed sides to each of them, neither of them knew they had. 

But because Ross and Rachel still remained friends and lived together and still went on dates with others, it felt like a messy arrangement, and there was a relief when it ended - which isn't how we're supposed to feel. Emma wasn't needed for any of this friction, and things could have played out exactly - just without a child involved. The Ross-Rachel-Joey thing could have been enough conflict on its own which would have kept us entertained. 

Other than the episode where Emma has a birthday, I can't remember much of her impacting story lines or touching my heart. I must say though, the thanksgiving episode with Amy and the godparent thing was the one time Emma added to the humour, but even so, this could have been a hypothetical conversation which came up which led to the same conclusions.  

Any time a baby is added into a sitcom, it's meant to be a big change. There are moments where Emma is only mentioned even though both parents are sitting around the coffee house doing nothing, yet she's the child of two main characters. How I Met Your Mother did parenting right - the characters evolved into becoming parents, and the child felt like the next phase in their story, but with Ross and Rachel, Emma felt shoved in for a good cliffhanger...and that's it.",0,1737030753.0,friends_tv_show,1,0.44,False

I’m from Eastern Europe and everything here is very unusual and new to me, so it’s very hard for me to adapt to my new life. I know it’s not about my skipping school problem, but I don’t have anyone to express this to, so I found myself needed to create a Reddit post. I hate Spain and everyone, in my school I got bullied, was made fun of, judgmental people and heard the same phrase everyday, which was ,,Go back to your home country puta”, and as a boy I shouldn’t be emotional sensitive, but it really hurt because I actually miss my home country, my friends, my sister, my grandparents and in general my country. My life was literally perfect there , I was enjoying my teenage years to the limits. But Ofc my parents decided suddenly that moving to Spain will be the best choice for our lives, which I highly disagree. I don’t have anyone friends here, I just rot in my room all day, mostly sleeping, crying and playing video games. Enough yapping let me get to the point, in October my mom went to our home country for 2 months because she needed to solve something, idk much cuz she didn’t want to tell me. My dad is a truck driver and he stays home only in the weekend, which means that I could stay at home instead of going to school, and my plan was simple, I was waking up Monday-Friday at 8:00AM, after that I was calling my parents saying that I woke up, dressing up for school, yk basic acting. It was finally the Time to clear out my head and to find my peace, maybe… I was just playing video games on my new pc, that’s all, occasionally going out at night to smoke and sit on a bench. 2 months pass by and it’s December, my mom comes back and I can’t skip school from now on… you may think. My dumbass it’s too scared to go back since idk what will happen to me and the fear of my parents being called by my teachers, sorry if I make some mistakes english isn’t my native language. What I do now is just taking some walks around the city, in the morning going to a cafeteria to get some food and coffee, after that I’m going to a park, listening to music and sitting on a bench like a pu$$y, after that I’m making my way to McDonald’s and I stay in the bathroom until the school finishes to go back home. I’m too scared to stay around people and I prefer the bathroom, actually smells nice and it’s clean.
But for the past month I’m feeling extremely terrible, I’m fcking burned out of everything, I lost my motivation to walk, not even going to school, just to walk around the city, I’m crying all nights, having insomnia, fatigue during the day and only thinking about the good old times in my home country. I’m feeling miserable for my parents too, thinking that their son is going to school and it’s ,,happy” but they just can’t understand that I want to go back where I feel like myself, not being around strangers and being criticised. Even if it’s a poor country and it doesn’t have the best life quality, our family is a middle-high class, we don’t lack privileges or basic human conditions, I was arguing with my mom non stop everyday because she is talking bs about our country which pmo badly. Right before the new year my dad and I got into a serious argument, because he kept asking me why do I look so bad and sucked out of energy, I said I’m alright don’t worry and right after that he exploded, he was screaming so hard that I don’t appreciate his efforts and some kids would kill to live in Spain, and that my friends won’t be forever and I don’t need to think about that poor ahh dogwater country, anyways I don’t think it’s necessarily to say the entire argument. I’m seeing my friends having fun, going out and creating memories like we used to but without me, and I also observed that they made new friends, are talking less and less with me, and forgot about my birthday until my some of them wished me happy birthday in our gc. I don’t mind this but js saying. I’m very upset because I kinda understand my dad, friends won’t be near you for life, and you need to know and feel being alone, but we are still in our teenage years, one of the greatest moments in our lives, I want to go out, live my years and having fun, because as soon as we all finish school, we won’t be the same. Will need to find a job, do a university and having our own family ofc. My mind isn’t clear, I have massive brain fog, I’m delusionol, overthink everything and broke up with my girlfriend. I don’t want to live this life anymore, so please, be kind and to anyone seeing this, help me, give me some pieces of advice, I want to end it all.",1,1737030737.0,depression,0,1.0,False

We stopped by a gas station on the way to my work this morning. She runs her own business from home but tales the car as she sometimes wants to run errands or just get out of the house.

Anyway, I wanted a snack for breakfast. I ask her if she wants coffee, she says yes. She then says in a musing way, like she's talking to herself, ""I kind of want a donut but I don't want the ones they have here, so don't worry about that"".

I go in, get her a coffee and me a Bubbl'R and a Little Debbie snack. That Little Debbie snack is one of her staples, but I only got one for me. My brain jumped straight to ""don't worry about that"", I guess.

Anyway, she was pissed off. I told her she could have the snack but that just pissed her off more. Before I got out of the car to go into work I offered it to her one more time and she said if I didn't take it with me she'd throw it out the window.

I was hungry, my brain was tired, I'm a very basic functioning human. That's my defense. AITAH here?



UPDATE: Talked to her on Messenger and she has forgiven me after explaining the key element was that I wasn't thinking of her when I grabbed her favorite snack for myself.

Among these, **organic monk fruit sweetener** has emerged as a popular choice. But what makes this sweetener stand out? In this article, we at Pekhill Foods delve into why **organic monk fruit sweetener** is the healthier choice for your sweetening needs.

**What is Organic Monk Fruit Sweetener?**

Monk fruit, also known as Luo Han Guo, is a small, green gourd native to southern China. The fruit has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine, primarily for its anti-inflammatory and cooling properties. The sweetness of monk fruit comes from natural compounds called mogrosides, which are much sweeter than sugar but contain no calories.

**Organic monk fruit sweetener** is derived from the juice of the monk fruit and processed without the use of synthetic chemicals, making it a pure and natural sweetener. Unlike artificial sweeteners, it doesn't contain harmful additives, preservatives, or fillers.

**Health Benefits of Organic Monk Fruit Sweetener**

1. **Rich in Antioxidants**

Monk fruit is rich in antioxidants, which help combat oxidative stress and reduce inflammation in the body. The mogrosides in monk fruit have been found to have anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties.

1. **No Artificial Ingredients**

Many sweeteners on the market contain artificial ingredients, which can have adverse health effects over time. **Organic monk fruit sweetener** is free from such additives, making it a healthier and more natural choice.

1. **Supports Weight Management**

Due to its zero-calorie content and low glycemic index, **organic monk fruit sweetener** can be a helpful tool in weight management. It allows individuals to enjoy sweet foods without the added calories that contribute to weight gain.

So dreams came true. I bought ticket 2 May flight -> 3 May 2025 till 14 May 2025. Right now I'm planning my trip, but this will be different thread about my Itineary and advices for that. I'll say that I will visit Tokyo, Kioto, Osaka, Nara. Probably also Hakone and Kamakura. Right now if possible I would like to ask You all for help about couple of things.

Will be grateful for any help.



1. Suica to pay for all railroads, subways? I also read about smartex, but it is not available in Europe?

2. Where is the best place to book accommodation? Booking?

2a. Hotel love? Do you recommend somewhere?

2b. Capsule hotel? Where do you recommend?

2c. Ryokan onsen? Are there any private ones? Can be even for an hour. I am not rich :'( Where do you recommend in cities that I mentioned.

2d. Sleep in temple? Do you recommend somewhere particular?

3. Kimono. Where can you rent one? I read that in Kyoto? The question is discovering city in this will be comfortable? Or do you recommend another way? I'm thinking, is it also possible to purchase some already at ease in Tokyo for the return trip? Any shop for that?

4. I have read that you can mostly get boiling water/there is a kettle in every hotel. I always start each day with coffee. Will I get any brewed or other coffee at 7eleven or other konbini?

5. Osaka, is it worth spending time there? My plan limits thisplace. However, maybe you think otherwise and it is worth adding a full day there?

5a. If 5 YES, is it worth buying a pass that makes it easier to get to many attractions and shortens queues? I associate that it costs about $20.

6. Kiyomizu-dera (Kyoto) - is it worth it? How to enter? Is there a fee to enter?

7. What is worth from the world of anime/manga to see in Japan? Ideally I'd like to focus on the places I mentioned, but you can still edit :) I will consider every option. I already know about boxing gym Hajime no Ippo in Tokyo or direct shots/shots from various anime like Death Note. Maybe some iconic location? Some kind of attraction park? A place with food? Or maybe a store that is a must visit? Write please!

8. Where can you buy clothes at relatively good prices and quality? Are there any such places where Japanese people shop for clothes and tourist will also find? :)

9. Where to buy some souvenirs, magnets, etc.?

10. Being in the USA last year, I got a delicate tattoo for a bagatelle $10 ;) I remember it warmly as I look back on it now, and I'm thinking of doing something like that again in Japan. I know that in general the community does not look favorably on this because of the Yakuze(?) But we are talking about something small and delicate here. Are there places that do a quick and small tattoo?

11. go-karts in Toyko - is it worth it?



I love to eat, and this is a dream come true for me - to be able to taste real Japanese cuisine. Itadakimas! Please give me recommendations for food. Places with points. I care about local things to try in a particular prefecture. I wants to try issues generally known to everyone such as:

\- Sushi

\- Sashimi

\- Kare raisu

\- Takoyaki

\- Ramen

\- Okonomiyaki

\- Yuba (tofu, udon) I read that somewhere in Kyoto good?

\- Yakitori

\- shabu-shabu

\- wagyu

\- street-food

I do not hide the fact that alcohol I would also like to try.... Something, somewhere recommended?

1i2no0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1i2no0m/i_feel_different_more_normal/,"I feel different, more ""normal""","I used to be a very fun person to be around. Very witty, almost invincible in the mind game. I took everything in a fun way and I was very open minded. I could easily socialize with anyone. 
Although all these ""superpowers"" weren't there for me all the time, I can say that I had them

Now, even though I have evolved as a human, I don't feel like that person anymore. Even when I feel at my peak, still,I think that I can not compare my current self to my old one. 

Jokes don't come naturally and when they do, they are not at the level they used to be. I feel like i lost my emotional intelligence.

I also feel very tired and unmotivated most of the times. I have no depression, maybe the exact opposite. I don't care about anything (if that's a hint)

Coffee, exersice, cold exposure, sitting and doing nothing in my room  and a little bit of going out of my comfort zone are my ways to try and reach my old self, with some success but not all that much.

I can easily say that I have converted from a way above average in intelligence person to a way more ""normal"". And normal is boring. 

Any help will be very welcome. Thanks in advance.

1i2nmjk,https://i.redd.it/pqznmduglcde1.jpeg,Trying to figure out how tall Shifty is.,"Slight Book of Bill spoilers
TLDR: I think he’s about 16-17cm tall.

Related to my last post on here about Shifty as I plan to make a sculpture of him that I then also plan to cast in silicone or plastisol for a squishy texture.

We can see in the image that the top half of his body seems to be the same height, if not a little bit taller than Ford’s mug, and so to try and measure this I measured the diameter of a coffee stain left on some of the missing journal pages in TBOB. I can’t be sure that it’s the same mug seen next to Shifty, but I’ll assume that it is, because my brain hurts from constantly thinking about this.

The diameter was about 6cm in length, standard American mugs have a diameter of about 8cm and are about 9.5cm tall (according to Google), so I just decided to -2cm from both of those measurements. Which means the mug is about 7.5cm tall and so this would put Shifty at about 15cm tall, based off the assumption that his real height would be around the same height as two mugs. In the image he appears slightly taller than the mug so I would guesstimate his height being around 16-17cm.

If you would like to correct my math, please do, I’m not good at it, if this post was hard to read I’m so sorry; English IS my first language, I’m just bad at it.

Also if someone has already made a sculpture like this I’d love to see it.",5,1737029819.0,gravityfalls,0,0.86,False

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

Armed with his phone, a cup of coffee, and $500 in his trading account, Carl dove into the market with enthusiasm unmatched by experience.

One evening, after a particularly painful day of losses, Carl stumbled upon a peculiar setting on his trading platform: the ability to adjust the time zone of his charts. “Wait a minute,” Carl thought, his eyes lighting up. “If I set the chart to the future time zone, I can see what’s going to happen before it does!”

Carl switched his charts to Tokyo time, convinced he had outsmarted the global Forex market. “I’m a genius!” he whispered to himself, placing trades based on his newfound “insider” knowledge of the future. Naturally, Carl ignored the fact that price movements remained exactly the same, regardless of the time zone displayed.

In the first hour, Carl miraculously made a profit—entirely by chance. “I knew it!” he exclaimed, texting his friends about his revolutionary discovery. One even replied, “Bro, that’s how Jeff Bezos probably started.”

But as the night wore on, Carl's “future” trades began to unravel. He placed a massive bet on the GBP/USD pair, thinking he could predict a breakout based on his Tokyo chart. Instead, the market plummeted faster than his confidence. Within minutes, Carl’s account balance looked like his chances of becoming the next Forex legend: zero.

The next day, Carl sheepishly called his friend Dave, a seasoned trader, and confessed his ""time-traveling"" strategy. Dave laughed so hard he nearly choked on his coffee. ""Carl, that's not how Forex works,"" he explained between chuckles. ""You didn’t time-travel—you just changed the clock. Next time, try learning support and resistance instead of thinking you’re Doctor Who.""

Carl learned an important lesson that day: there are no shortcuts in Forex, and time zones don’t equal time machines. With Dave's advice, Carl signed up for [TradingView](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/), where he could practice proper analysis using advanced charting tools. “Wow,” Carl said, exploring the platform. “So this is what real traders use!”

From then on, Carl stuck to the basics and left time travel to the movies—though his friends never stopped calling him The Forex Time Traveler.",1,1737029467.0,CryptoForexSyndicate,0,1.0,False
