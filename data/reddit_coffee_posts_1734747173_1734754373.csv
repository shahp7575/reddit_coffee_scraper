1hj1uwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/castlevania/comments/1hj1uwf/my_review_of_portrait_of_ruin_still_not_above_an/,"My Review of Portrait of Ruin. Still not above an 8/10, but more enjoyable than Dawn of Sorrow and Aria of Sorrow.","# Let me state that, having played Aos and Dos, I HAVE enjoyed both of them, and even committed to the boss rushes and new game plus.

# However with Portrait of Ruin, I had more fun.

# There are, however, flaws. 

# So  let's talk about the bad before we get to the good.

Luck/Grinding: To kill a Demon 200 times to get FOUR Super Tonics, or to kill certain enemies dozens to hundreds of times over to get a specific item.

The Luck Stat was supposed to be BETTER in Portrait compared to the Sorrow series where you kill peeping eye 30 times in AoS to get its soul, or the Creature 50 times in Dawn of Sorrow to get its soul.

So unfortunately, even if you level up close to level 80, luck is NOT on your side.

The Quests: I love and hate the quests because they make some of them so difficult or push you away from doing certain things.

The Miser Ring has the power to surpass the Headhunter from AoS. But it requires 100K gold per increase in stats. Now then....suppose you do new game plus?  You'll have to deplete your currency once again to get a second miser ring. Worth it though, so I recommend  purchasing multiple master rings and the like.

The Spin quests are hard to pull off, and part of the reason I had issues with Circle of the moon. You might not even be using those techniques either.

Most of the quests with the best items take place in the last 80-99% of the game...let me repeat. You won't get an item speeding up charlotte's spells, all of charlotte's spells, the rapid regen MP ring, or the best team attack until the practically end of the game.  
AFTER you defeat Brauner, the second to last boss.  
With Circle of the moon,you just needed to put ""MAGICIAN"" as your title, and you could start with all of the spell cards.  
Here, you have to explore every nook and cranny of the game in order  to get to the Nest Of Evil to get the final quests.

At least with new game plus, you don't have to do it all over again, and the maps remain completed. But the nest of evil still remains locked until late to end game. AFTER you defeat the 2nd to final boss.

The Subweapons...

I'm fine with the master ring costing 200K gold to get....what I'm NOT fine with is how many weapons you're required to master when it requires 1500-2000 kills/skill points. Between the grinding for items and leveling up the subweapons, I was able to reach level 80 on THOSE ALONE. At least you KEEP all those masteries in new game plus.

The cakes in 13th Street. In the initial game, you need TWO gold  rings if you want to collect all the cakes. Strange in that New Game Plus, you can only collet 1 new game from 13th  Street.

  
Now we move onto charlotte.  
Her spells are awesome, but too easy to interrupt, and take too much time to charge until you get the sorceress crest. It makes it harder to appreciate using her for most of the game unless you heavily level up to at least 70.

And that  Sanctuary  spell was a nightmare to pull off against the Lecarde sisters. Its doable, not impossible, but rough!

Next...the nest of evil...imagine leveling up to level 80 because  you  grinded  for different items ,spells, and level up subweapons...now in the nest of Evil, you STILL need to grind for MORE items to complete quests.  
And somehow, the enemies can still kill you. The cave troll's electric attack took down my 1000+ health bar in  mere seconds...

# Well, that's the flaws....let's talk about the good.

First, the spoiled foods/toxic foods. In new game plus, these become invaluable in getting the Miser Ring by reducing health in front of vincent.

The skull ring or mask whatever curses you, allowing you to do the same with MP.

So the game DOES give you the means to achieve that quest a second time.

Which leads us to The Miser Ring.

In the first game alone, whether grinding on high level enemies who drop valuable weapons, o getting the Gold Rings, it IS time consuming but worthwhile if you want  to grind several million gold, as the Miser Ring SURPASSES the Headhunter Soul from AoS.

In New game Plus? Two of those rings? Charlotte becomes a goddess who can shrug off dracula's ultimate and one-shot bosses with spells alone. it makes you basically Saitama but with magic and weapons.  Which makes New Game Plus quite fun!

Speaking of Charlotte. One issue I had with Circle of the Moon was how hard it was to pull off button combinations for most of the card spells. Though I do appreciate the Magician Mode that let me start the game with them. With Charlotte you  not only have tons of options with spells, your tomes, while limited like your spells compared to Jonathan, are still quite fun. And in New Game plus, she's all but omnipotent with the new tools you can give her. I had so much fun using her character.

**Plus its nice to give girls the option to play as a female character whose intelligence is praised by friend and foe alike. We all know how hard it is for our family  to acknowledge us and our hard work, right?**

The Order Of Ecclesia I haven't tried yet, but for now, I used Charlotte Exclusively on New Game Plus.  
Its also fun to add the challenge of having her fight Jonathan during the Astarte boss fight. Cool mechanic. And her dialogue after is...relatable? Cute?

And speaking of the boss fights...they were all more interesting, entertaining, and challenging compared to the Sorrow Bosses. For one, you had to learn their moves. Two, you had to try different strategies compared to the boss you fought before. It gave you sense of accomplishment , more so than the Soma Boss Fights. Interestingly, those bosses are in the Nest of Evil, as well as the Dark Academy as enemies. And they're somehow fun to fight this time.

Dracula as the final boss is cool because if you level up enough, you don't have to use the teamwork system to handle his ultimate. But it was a bit depressing as his ultimate form only has that and  stomping on you.

But prior to that, Dracula teaming up with Death is SUCH A FUN IDEA. And it was well done.

Even leading up to that? The final boss of Nest of Evil and Brauner both are entertaining and creative to fight.

The story is fascinating and ties in multiple games in the series without the need for retcons. It humanizes Brauner without making him sympathetic.He's still awful and irredeemable, but you do understand his motives, even though its so easy to find them absolutely contemptible.

Now let's go onto weapons.  
Starting with the subweapons...SO many options.  
From the  exploding crossbow to the Belmont Weapons, to the shurikens to the AURA BLAST. And the best part is that these got stronger the more you used them.

Then the actual weapons...as in AoS, the final guard gives the second to best sword, next to the royal sword.   One quest gives you MAXIM'S Sword, AND you can get the Alucard spear. Lots of fun callbacks.  
Each of the weapons can be used for different options and quests. What's great is that the game requires you to try different things out.

Now for equipment.

Lots of different customizable options.Headgear,  footwear, two arm options, and a weapon slot.

The gear is interesting, and  you can mix  and match far more  options than nearly  any other game

And speaking of so many options.? There's so much food!

So not only is there tons of health items, but coffee and tea can be used to replenish your MP as well!



# All in all, I'll give this game an 8/10 and would  recommend  it to others for the co-op options",1,1734754124.0,castlevania,0,1.0,False

1hj1tzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicNova/comments/1hj1tzj/kindness/,Kindness...,"To be honest, I’m not a programmer. I don’t know how to write code but enjoy tinkering and learning. I bought Nova when Panic introduced it, as I was already familiar with Coda and Coda 2. I used it to edit my blog and try out a few open-source projects shared by others on GitHub. That’s about it.

Panic introduced Coda, and later came the annual software upgrade/maintenance subscription. From my perspective as someone in marketing, I saw it as no different from those annoying subscription services out there. I understand that everyone needs revenue to survive. After all, people work to make money. I still paid for the subscription to use Nova.

From 2022 until now, for over a year, Nova has received small patch updates and minor tweaks. Paying $49 a year just for bug fixes didn’t sit well with me.

Then, strangely enough, when my subscription expired, Nova released a new update. It fixed more bugs, optimized things more, etc. I decided not to renew my subscription and switched to Zed. I don’t know how to write code, and before LLMs, I had to Google and read everything to modify my website the way I wanted. The whole process took a few days. Now, it’s much quicker—just a few minutes. Zed has features that Nova doesn’t, and vice versa... So now I find myself with one foot in each boat, which is uncomfortable, but still better than before.

On a beautiful day, Nova announced the 12.2 update, and to my surprise, it allowed me to update, even though my account had expired and I hadn’t renewed my subscription.

That day, I still made myself a cup of coffee, as usual, but the coffee tasted better.

I’m not here to evaluate or judge anything. I want to say that sometimes, being kind to existing customers is more important than chasing after new ones.

That’s my experience, working in marketing.",1,1734754029.0,PanicNova,0,1.0,False

1hj1lmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teethgumhealth/comments/1hj1lmy/teeth_whitening_products_for_veneers/,Teeth Whitening Products For Veneers,"Best Teeth Whitening Products for Veneers: What You Need to Know
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you have veneers and are considering teeth whitening products, it's crucial to understand how these products interact with your dental work. Unlike natural teeth, veneers are made from materials that do not respond to traditional whitening treatments. Therefore, choosing the right whitening products is essential for maintaining your bright smile. Here, we’ll explore the best options available, ensuring you can achieve a whiter appearance while protecting your veneers.

### Understanding Veneers and Whitening

Veneers are thin shells generally made of porcelain or composite resin. They are designed to cover the front surface of teeth to enhance their appearance. Because of their material, they do not absorb whitening agents like natural teeth do. This means that while your natural teeth may get whiter, your veneers might stay the same color or even look discolored next to your newly whitened teeth.

### Safe Whitening Options for Veneers

It’s important to consider specific products that are safe for use with veneers. Here are the best options to help you achieve a glowing smile:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Whitening Toothpaste**: Look for a gentle whitening toothpaste that is safe for veneers. These toothpastes often contain low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or baking soda. Be cautious, as some whitening toothpastes can be abrasive and may scratch the surface of your veneers.
- **Whitening Pens**: These are easy to use and can be applied directly to the teeth. Many brands offer formulations that are safe for veneers. The hydrogen peroxide concentration is usually lower, making it less likely to cause harm.
- **Professional Cleaning**: Visiting your dentist for a professional cleaning can help remove stains from both natural teeth and veneers. This is a great way to maintain your overall smile without risking damage to your veneers.
- **LED Whitening Kits**: Some at-home LED whitening systems are designed to be gentle on veneers. These kits usually include a whitening gel with lower peroxide levels. Always check with your dentist before starting treatment.
- **Natural Alternatives**: Baking soda and activated charcoal have become popular among those looking for natural whitening methods. However, you should use these sparingly and ensure they won’t damage your veneers.

### Things to Avoid

To keep your veneers looking perfect, there are some products and practices you should avoid:

- **Do Not Use High-Strength Bleaching Agents**: Products with high levels of hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide can damage the glaze of your veneers and lead to discoloration over time.
- **Avoid Home Remedies**: Some DIY whitening solutions, like lemon juice or vinegar, can be too acidic and may wear down the surface of your veneers.

### Consult Your Dentist

Your dentist is your best resource when it comes to whitening your teeth, especially if you have veneers. They can recommend products specifically formulated for cosmetic work and guide you on the best care practices. This ensures that your smile remains beautiful and vibrant while maintaining the quality of your veneers.

### Maintaining Your Smile

To keep your veneers looking their best, regular dental check-ups and attention to oral hygiene are key. Here are some tips to maintain the brightness of both your natural teeth and veneers:

- **Regular Brushing and Flossing**: Maintaining good oral hygiene helps prevent stains from developing on your veneers and natural teeth.
- **Limit Stain-Causing Foods and Drinks**: Be mindful of foods and beverages, like coffee and red wine, that can lead to staining.
- **Use a Straw**: When consuming beverages that can stain your teeth, consider using a straw. This helps reduce contact between the drink and your teeth.
- **Stay Hydrated**: Drinking plenty of water not only aids your overall health but also helps wash away food particles and sugars that can cause staining.

Selecting the right teeth whitening products for veneers is essential for achieving a beautiful, well-maintained smile. Understand the limitations of your veneers and choose safe, appropriate methods to enhance your teeth without damaging them. Regular dental visits and good oral hygiene will also play a crucial role in maintaining your stunning smile.

The Do's and Don'ts of Maintaining Your Veneers for Optimal Brightness
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you've invested in veneers to enhance your smile, maintaining their brightness is key to your confidence and overall appearance. While these dental enhancements can transform your look, they do require special care to keep them looking their best. Below are essential do's and don'ts to follow in order to maintain your veneers for optimal brightness.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Do Regularly Clean Your Veneers

Just like natural teeth, your veneers need regular cleaning to avoid discoloration. Here are effective ways to ensure your veneers stay shiny:

- **Brush Twice Daily:** Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and non-abrasive fluoride toothpaste daily. This helps remove plaque and prevent stains.
- **Floss:** Daily flossing is crucial to get rid of food particles between your teeth and veneers, maintaining your gum health.
- **Use Mouthwash:** An alcohol-free mouthwash can help reduce bacteria and keep your breath fresh, adding to your overall oral hygiene.

- **Inspect the Health of Your Veneers:** Regular evaluations help identify any changes or damage early on.
- **Polish Your Veneers:** Professional cleaning can enhance the shine of your veneers and remove built-up stains.
- **Help with Adjustments:** If your bite changes, your dentist may adjust your veneers to prevent wear and tear.

### Do Use a Straw When Drinking Staining Beverages

Certain drinks can stain your veneers over time. To minimize this risk:

- **Choose a Straw:** Using a straw for beverages like coffee, tea, or red wine can help reduce contact with your veneers, preserving their brightness.
- **Drink Water:** Follow any staining drink with water to rinse away potential stains.

### Don't Use Abrasive Toothpaste

While keeping your veneers clean is essential, using harsh or gritty toothpaste can scratch their surface. Choose only non-abrasive and gentle options specifically designed for sensitive teeth or restorative dental work.

### Don't Forget About Your Diet

Your eating habits can significantly affect your veneers' appearance. Be mindful of the following:

- **Avoid Highly Staining Foods:** Limit consumption of foods like berries, soy sauce, and beetroot, which can cause discoloration.
- **Don't Chew Hard Foods:** Chewing ice or hard candies can damage your veneers and lead to chips.
- **Limit Sugary Snacks:** Sugar promotes decay around your veneers, which can affect their durability.

### Don't Ignore Signs of Damage

If you notice any changes in your veneers, address them promptly. Signs to watch out for include:

- **Chips or Cracks:** Report any physical damage to your dentist as soon as possible.
- **Increased Sensitivity:** If you experience discomfort, it could indicate a problem with your veneers or the underlying tooth.

### Don't Rely Solely on Whitening Products

While you may feel tempted to use teeth whitening products on your veneers, remember that most of these products are not safe for non-natural teeth. Instead, focus on maintaining good oral hygiene and consult your dentist for options tailored specifically for dental enhancements.

By following these do's and don'ts, you can ensure your veneers remain bright and beautiful, allowing you to enjoy your smile to the fullest. Remember, taking care of your veneers is a long-term commitment that pays off in confidence and appearance.

### Conclusion

Maintaining the brilliance of your veneers goes beyond just choosing the right whitening products; it involves a holistic approach to oral care. Selecting the best teeth whitening products specifically designed for veneers is crucial. Look for options that are safe and effective, ensuring they won’t damage the veneer material while providing the brightness you desire. Products with gentle, non-abrasive formulas are your best bet.

Additionally, understanding the do's and don'ts for maintaining your veneers can make a significant difference in their longevity and appearance. Regular brushing with a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste is recommended, as it helps keep your veneers looking pristine. Avoiding abrasive scrubs, whitening toothpaste, or harsh treatments will preserve the integrity of your veneers and their color. Staying away from foods and drinks that can lead to staining, such as red wine, coffee, and dark sodas, will also keep your smile vibrant.

It's about creating a balanced routine that enhances not only the aesthetics but also the health of your teeth and gums. By following these guidelines and choosing the right products, you can enjoy a brighter smile that lasts. Investing time and care into your dental hygiene will pay off in the long run, ensuring that your veneers remain a stunning part of your smile for years to come.

Drafting a message to address it is making me think I'm making it more than it is.,"Hello all, this is a longer one so I thank in advance anyone who reads this in full. I (26F) have gotten into a situation with a coworker (24M) and I would like some help figuring out if I'm over exaggerating or not, and how to navigate this with grace, as I have to work with this guy for the foreseeable future. We've been working together for the past four months or so on a crew that usually totals around 3-5 people per shift. There'd been light flirting between us on both ends but I've made it continually clear how much I enjoy being single and only having to worry about my dog.



Well about two weeks ago, he gifts me an early Christmas present of a book we had been discussing that I had been debating buying. Awesome, love it, I tell him I'm appreciative and we move on. He messages me a few days later and asks if I want to hang out and read and eat food on Saturday, I tell him yes and I'm excited to start reading my new book. This would be our first time hanging out outside of work. When I go to his place we don't end up reading but instead watch movies on the couch and he ends up laying his head on my shoulder. Cool, okay, whatever, I was almost asleep so we passed out and woke up spooning the following morning.



I have to work that night but have the following night off (Monday) and ask if he wants to hang out again then, as I don't have anything going on. I had been planning on talking to him to see where his head was at as well after Saturday so we could be on the same page. He arrives at my place with roses and wine so I ask him what was going on in his head regarding the situation. He looked at me and kind of laughed and said, ""I think you're emotionally intelligent enough to be able to separate work and personal."" and I told him ""Yes, but I've known a guy before who 'casually cuddled' (shoulder touching only) when we hung out and after a month of that he mentioned our anniversary without ever saying anything else so I wanted to be sure."" He laughed again and said ""Well, this is only our second time hanging out outside of work, isn't it?"" and I said sure and decided to drop it unless things escalated.



We drank the wine and watched a couple movies and he said he was going to pass out and asked me to cuddle until he fell asleep so I said okay because he had backed off a bit after we talked. Then I myself fell asleep. Then I woke up and he was in the middle of kissing me. Then I woke up and his hand was down the back of my pants. Then I woke up and he was kissing me again. Then I woke up and he was grabbing my chest and kissing me again. I kept telling myself if I was sleeping it wasn't happening. I didn't react or do anything I was just frozen while it was happening to my body.



The next morning he grabbed his gun off of the coffee table and kissed me like it was the most normal thing in the world. I got him to leave so I could get some more sleep before work and kind of pushed it away. Tuesday evening work was fine. Wednesday evening, I went in to work and saw him and just got incredibly anxious and had anxiety attacks all night, even after he left. Last night, I went in and was just incredibly angry every time I had to interact with him.



All of this to say, I keep drafting and redrafting a message to him, trying to explain how upset I am with what happened and ask for an explanation but every time I do and try to keep it concise, it just doesn't seem like that big of a deal and I can't stop questioning myself. I essentially currently have (paraphrased) ""hey, I don't like how that went down, I tried to make sure we were on the same page and you pulled this, what were you hoping to achieve?"" then suggest no contact outside of work related stuff moving forward. I would appreciate any advice, suggestions, etc.



TL;DR A coworker kissed and groped me in my sleep after I tried to discuss boundaries and now I'm having emotional outbursts when I see him. I'm trying to draft a confrontation? desire for explanation? text so I can get some resolution but it just doesn't seem like a big deal when I type it out so now I'm doubting myself.",1,1734752610.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

After a gig I did a few weeks ago at a techno festival, we ran into a major issue during post-production: we had planned to use the cut detection feature in Davinci Resolve or Premiere to identify the cuts made during the recording, but... every strobe effect caused a cut on every single frame! 😅

I first discovered that there are already some software tools that can do this (I'm thinking of Multicam Logger, which is only available on macOS and priced ridiculously high 💸), and the other projects I came across seemed abandoned. We managed without it, but it inspired me to create a small tool to log an ATEM program while syncing the timecode with the HyperDeck, and at the end, generating an EDL file with each cut.

So, after 3 weeks of hard work on this project, here is the first public release of a small tool I took the time to create, available as open-source on GitHub, with two precompiled versions (one for Windows x64, and one for macOS ARM).

1hj1dx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christians/comments/1hj1dx1/why_a_joyful_christmas_photo_left_me_feeling_sad/,Why a Joyful Christmas Photo Left Me Feeling Sad,"I didn’t know why, but the candid photo of Doris, her husband, and their young children laughing in front of a Christmas tree made me sad. The sensation was strange because I was staring at an image of pure joy. Why should I feel anything other than happy? I wouldn’t understand until later.

At eighty-five years old, Doris died at home, though it wasn’t her home. As her health failed to the point of no return, she had to move into a makeshift bedroom at the back of her daughter’s house. While the accommodations were better than a nursing home, she was confined to a hospital bed in a former mud room connected to the garage. Her teenage grandchildren didn’t bother to adjust. They continued to use her new bedroom as their entrance into the house every day after school.

I know this about Doris because I met her daughter and stood in that makeshift bedroom shortly after she died. I was there with a colleague from the funeral home. As the funeral director, he collected information from the family while I waited by Doris’s bed to provide lift assistance and offer prayer if requested. Meanwhile, I assessed the room to determine whether we needed to move furniture and plan the smoothest route from her bed to the minivan we parked in the driveway. My task was completed quickly, so I wandered over to a wall covered from floor to ceiling in framed family photographs.

The wall was like a museum dedicated to Doris. The photos spanned her life, from black-and-white childhood snapshots to colorful images of her eightieth birthday party. I saw blurry pictures of Doris behind the wheel of a Vista Cruiser and Polaroids of a family vacation to the Grand Canyon. As I glanced from one to the next, I was genuinely amused, not to mention engrossed. Each frame captured a priceless moment in this woman’s perfectly ordinary yet richly blessed life. I was captivated, thoroughly enjoying my walk through a stranger’s memories.

Near the center of the collage was the Christmas photo. The picture was spontaneous. Whoever stood behind the camera didn’t have to instruct Doris and her family to say cheese. Surrounded by wrapped gifts and now-vintage holiday decor, they were already smiling. Better yet, someone had caught them in a fit of unrestrained bliss. They threw their heads back and revealed every tooth as they laughed with mouths wide open. I didn’t know why they were laughing, but that couldn’t stop me from wanting to climb inside the frame and enjoy the moment as much as they were.

The smile on my face, however, soon disappeared. The joy I gleaned was overwhelmed by a sense of melancholy. In hindsight, the reason is evident, but I was slow to make the connection. The sweetness of the photo was necessarily mingled with bitterness. After all, two of the four beaming faces in the picture were now dead and gone. I was peering into an unretrievable past. Doris, her husband, and their children would never share another Christmas. They would never have another opportunity to make each other laugh like they did years before.

Then again, I’m a full-time chaplain at a funeral home. Death is as routine for me as a coffee break. I’m surrounded by the sting of loss every day. How could one photo have such a profound effect on me? I was barely suppressing tears even hours later. Each time that Christmas snapshot appeared in my mind’s eye, I felt uneasy and confused.

The answer came to me just before dinner. As I watched my young children playing on the living room floor, my daughter whacked my son with a pillow. He fell hard onto his back, hitting his head on the carpet with an audible thud. I braced myself for screaming, but instead, I heard a roar of laughter. My son thought it was funny, my daughter found it hilarious, and they made a game of it, repeating it five or six more times before I intervened to encourage less violent activity.

*A house full of laughter*, I thought. *A loving family enjoying one another. Young children relishing simple pleasures with a degree of freedom only children can know. That’s what bothers me.* 

The photo on Doris’s wall was a still frame of my current stage of life. Those were my children. That was my living room and Christmas tree. I’m married to Doris. Though we have a pretty great life together, filled with one blessing after another worth capturing on film, I was made painfully aware that a day will come when the last picture will be hung. If I’m as fortunate as anyone can be, I’ll breathe my last as an old man on a hospital bed in the back of my daughter’s house, staring at photos of a past I can never get back. They’re already slipping away from me. Four decades of precious moments are gone forever. Eventually, time won’t allow for new ones.

I tried to document every step through this process to what I remember. Below is a breakdown of the experience after receiving the IL for Dec 16, 2024. DQ Jun 10, 2024, submitted application April 2023. 

After the original email, the appointment was rescheduled from Dec 16 to Dec 20, and I was notified via email on Nov 26, 2024. 

**Preparing for the CR1 interview: what I printed, what I packed, and how I organized**

I want to start by saying I am an anxious traveller and tend to prepare as much as I can so some of these steps may seem redundant or excessive. Before boarding the flight, I packed:

* my original copies: 
   * birth certificate
   * marriage license
   * RCMP criminal record report 
   * Canadian Citizenship Naturalization Certificate (I am a Canadian immigrant)
* my husband's original copies: 
   * birth certificate
   * W2 tax form
* printed/copies: 
   * my husband's IRS tax transcript & all tax filings (W2, 1099, 1040)
   * Form I-864 
   * DS-260 form and confirmation
   * first appointment invitation email
   * notice of interview email 
   * medical test result 
* 2 x passport photos
* my Canadian passport 
* my driver's license 

**Flying into Montreal** \- Because my original appointment date was on Dec 16, I booked my flight for Dec 15. My appointment was rescheduled after I booked my husband and my flight and accommodation, so we just went to Montreal on the original date even though our appointment was rescheduled. For us, it was not necessary to go early. 

**How I organized all the documents** \- paperclipped all the multi-page documents and labelled them with post-its. This helped me easily identify which stack of documents I'll need to take out during the interview process. 

**What else I packed on my trip** \- a small foldable tote because you cannot bring in any backpacks or any bigger bags. I saw other interviewees using plastic bags or small canvas totes and those were also allowed in. 



**Getting into the Consulate: lining up, security, and document checklist**

**When I got there:** My appointment was at 8:00am and I got to the building at about 7:20am. There was already a line waiting outside of the consulate. I heard from some chatter that there is also a 7:30am and 7:45am appointment timeslot. My husband and I went for a coffee at the coffee shop opposite the consulate and went back to the building after we were done, lining up in the queue with about 5 groups in front of me. We started lining up at 7:40am. 

**When I got into the consulate:** The staff started letting in interviewees one group at a time. She shouted down the line the interview times she was now letting in to see if there were any earlier appointments she would need to let in first. I got in at 8:00am sharp, with two groups in front of us who got in before 8:00am even though their appointment was at 8:00am. My husband was not allowed in, so he went back to the coffee shop to wait. 

**Passport pre-check and list of documents they need to check:** Past the front doors, there was a security checkpoint. I first gave a staff member my passport where she checked on a list of interviewees that day and stuck a pre-printed sticker onto my passport with my name on it. She then printed my ticket number twice and folded it in my passport. This ticket number was used at the actual interview. She gave me back my passport, the ticket number, and a small laminated yellow paper. 

The yellow paper included a list of documents they needed me to show:

* 2 x passport photos 
* my birth certificate
* marriage license 
* Form I-864
* my husbands tax forms

**Security check, bag scan, and lockers:** After the passport pre-check, I was then moved to an area where I had to empty my pockets, take out my phone, take off my jacket, and walk through a metal detector. This was akin to airport security. The staff also asked if I had a laptop, earpods/airpods, or smart watch. Laptops were not allowed in. Phones, earpods/airports, and smart watches were required to be put into a locker. I was also asked to power off my phone. The locker is about the size of a postbox. I could still bring my documents and small purse in with me.

  
**Waiting process and the appointment** 

After putting my belongings into the locker, I took the elevator up to the appointment waiting area (1st floor). When you enter, it's a waiting room with chairs facing the counters. There is a TV screen that says what number is being called to what counter. Some staff also speak into the intercom what number they're calling. I got into the waiting room at about 8:15am. 

When I got seated, I reviewed the document checklist (yellow laminate paper) and took some time to take out the documents required. This is not required, I just figured I would do it while I was waiting

Stage 1: Document check 

* at about 8:30am, my number was called. I went to the counter and the staff was nice. She asked for me for my passport, my passport photos, my birth certificate, and marriage license.
* The staff also verified my below information:
   * my name 
   * my relation to the petitioner
   * my address
   * my husband's address 
   * my phone number
* After verification, she put my passport, my birth certificate, and marriage license into a folder to give to the next staff member and I was asked to sit down again to wait for the next call. She returned my passport photo after scanning it. This stage took about 20 mins.

Stage 2: Fingerprints

At about 9:00am, my number was called again and another staff member took my prints. all five fingers.

Stage 3: The interview

At about 9:20am, my number was called again by another staff member. This staff member started our conversation by asking me to take an oath; she read off a script that I will be truthful during this process and I had to verbally confirm.  After this, she looked at my birth certificate, and marriage license. After checking those documents, she returned them to me. She did not ask for the other two documents that was required, but did verbally confirm to me that they had received my medical test results. 

In this conversation, she then asked me the below questions:

* What city does your husband live in?
* How did you and your husband meet?
* When did you start dating?
* When did you get married?
* Have you and your husband had other marriages? 
* Do you have children?
* Do you have children outside of this marriage?
* Do you travel to see your husband?
* What types of travel do you do e.g. work travel, vacationing?
* How often do you see your husband?
* How often do you communicate with your husband?
* When was the last time you saw your husband?
* What does your husband do for a living?
* What do you do for a living and are you planning to do something similar after you move?

She was very friendly and easy to understand.

Stage 4: Approval!

After answering her questions, she told me that she approved my visa status! she then took my passport away and told me it will be 2-3 weeks for them to put the packet together because of the holidays. The whole interview process ended at 9:45am so it was 1hr 15 mins appointment. 

The next stage for my husband and I are to wait for my passport to arrive in the mail to complete my immigration process. Wish us luck!",2,1734752030.0,NationalVisaCenter,0,1.0,False

Yesterday, we chatted and at the end I gave him my number (which, I was planning: I wrote it on a piece of wrapping paper and taped it to a coupon for a free drink). His smile was adorable. This is the first time I ever gave a guy my number without being asked (Im also Autistic, so social interactions are not a strength for me). 
I’ve tried online dating, and I hate it. I think I’m ready to start dating again but I definitely need to learn what’s normal/not normal behavior and a general idea of what to expect would be great. 
I’ve almost always had struggles with self confidence, but over the past couple years I’ve made massive improvements in this area, and though I’m a single mom and I’m older, I know what I deserve. 

What makes me second guess is our conversations about him struggling to stand up for himself to servers/customer service workers if there’s a problem with his order, not wanting to hurt them or bother them, etc. Is this the case for me? 

He didn’t reach out to me yesterday…
Came back into my job this morning, purposely got my attention to apologize for not texting because he passed out when he got home. 
However, it’s late now, and nothing. 
Am I getting mixed signals or am I overthinking? 
Why don’t people ever just be clear and direct with what they want? 


TLDR; guy showed interest but after getting my number hasn’t reached out… How long should i wait til I move on? ",1,1734751834.0,AskMenAdvice,4,1.0,False

I paid almost $18 for 2 drinks.  Nothing too special, a gingerbread latte and a cinnamon latte. The cinnamon I paid extra for breve.   But today their greed has gone too far.  I was told by the manager on duty that I could only have 1 ounce of half and half. Didn’t matter that I ordered 2 drinks, nor that I already paid extra for breve.  She told me this is a corporate decision. All Starbucks are supposed to be charging for more cream. 

Now as a very longtime customer (20 plus years) I have adapted to not having the milk station. Before I would always go into the store to personalize my coffee.  After Covid I always tried to be as considerate as possible. I know the employees are always so busy.  Occasionally I have had to almost beg to get extra half and half.   And I certainly know all of us have received drinks that are only 2/3 full.  I have never complained because I could add the cream myself.  

I feel like they keep pushing and pushing for more money for what has basically become a mediocre cup of coffee.  I do not blame the manager. I am certain she was instructed that is what she has to do.  I left there so upset and angry.  At what point do we break?  I think I did today. ",0,1734751497.0,starbucks,3,0.44,False

1hj143i,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1hj143i/trip_report/,Trip report,"Usually just lurk or comment but tried a few different things this time so thought I'd give my take.  If you want craps you can check my comments in that sub.

Stayed at Versailles towers.  I like Paris, I like the horseshoe, I do not like Versailles.  The rooms might be a little newer but there's no fridge, no shower shelf,  and I could hear drai's/ole red even on the 72nd floor.  The new walkway is nice and quiet though compared to the affectionately named hooker alley.

First meal was 2 am at the Henry.  I love the coffee and their short rib Benedict.  Service is always great too.  I might need to try sauce on the side though because it does get overwhelming.

Breakfast I headed over to Ellis Island.  I love cheap craps and they have some good food deals.  I always stop by at least once, but with construction and metro pizza being closed, it's a little less attractive though I'll probably still go for craps.  And the boozy eggnog someone recommended is indeed boozy.

Dinner was at hells kitchen.  Sat at the bar so missed watching the kitchen, couple next to me was nice though and the meet your maker cocktail was yummy.  Got the prix fixe, scallops were good, and the Wellington is hit or miss in some reviews but mine was delicious, and I was honestly amazed how tender it was.  The toffee is probably what'd make me return though.

Breakfast was at hash house at the linq.  It's another place I always hit.  Cool server that overrode some of my decisions to make things better which I was perfectly okay with.  Always good food and portions.  

Did I mention Versailles had no fridge?  And I have like $60 of leftovers.   I have no idea why they made that decision.

Headed to the arts district for the first time in the afternoon.  Literally got off the deuce and literally the first person I saw was like coke? Shrooms?  Thought that was funny   Walked around, stopped at good pie for a slice.  It was good but the server was like just one? without mentioning it was bogo during happy hour.

Oh right, everyone mentions Esther's kitchen so I was ill try it!  I didn't realize the price though so maybe next time when I'm not wandering aimlessly.

Stopped at bar ginza, I don't remember what I saw it on, but it's always cool to try a place where the owner obsesses about something, in this case Japanese whiskey.  Quiet place seems slightly out of place but I enjoyed the recommendations.

Yes, I ate even more (to be fair it's two meals a day, plus a slice of pizza and a lot of leftovers).  I had to try Cornish pasty because I love hand pies and they're so highly rated.  The shepherd's pie was delicious, the ice cream with the apple dessert was really good, the pie itself was okay but I also ate most of it later instead of hot.

Shout-out to Jess/a? From swandive.  Ran into her taking a break from bar ginza.  She made the show sound amazing, $12 cover, cool person, and I got turned away at the door because I couldn't bring food in ...

Anyway will definitely return to the arts district.  Oh, the downside, they closed the south station for construction but there's no sign.  Like how hard to put a temporary x through it or something, anything.  So I had to watch the deuce pass two blocks away and then the next station is a sketchy 10 minute walk away.  Like I'm not scared of most situations and I'm always carrying part of my gambling bankroll without a worry, but that walk is sus.

I could get the casseroles most of the way cooked at home, transport them and finish them off at the lodge and that would provide more oven time for eggs. But ideally I’d love an egg dish I can cook the day before and reheat the day of.

First off....let's just say it....

""Carol-Anne"" X 121, according to the IMDb.

It definitely gives the feel of it's own film right from the start wth the music alone.  No sinister angelic choirs, etc.  Just an unmemorable soundtrack.  Hmmm...ok, moving on...

Pluses - Nancy Allen!  Tom Skerrit!  Love 'em both!  It's nice to see Tangina back, if only for a brief time.  Lara Flynn Boyle in her prime?  No problem.

Gotta say, quite the building...tons of shopping and all shiny with lots of mirrors...

And here's where the film excels - the practical and visual effects and tricks with mirrors / reflections are the standout; easily the saving grace of the film.

Cause some of the acting sure ain't; Carol Anne's doctor (I'm not even going to look up the name of the poor actor because his character has been so trashed and I now look at his performance as camp like Faye Dunaway in ""Mommie Dearest"") makes out the worst in this.  Poor guy.

Oh...and I am completely embarrassed for poor Scott and the doctor after Scott's icy exit from the pool.  if there were an emmy version of worst acted scene at the Razzies, the two of them together is the scene that probably won in 1988.  ""in the garage...in the garage...IN THE GARAGE!!!!""

Nathan Davis sadly isn't as nearly effective as Julian Beck was as Kane in Pt. 2 (in spite of, and in some ways because of, his health issues at the time).  I have to wonder if the filmmakers knew it; there's no meaningful interaction with Kane and any characters here; too bad and a missed opportunity.

Clearly, it's not entirely the actor's fault (except for maybe the doctor); the writing is another problem.  ""Mass hypnosis"" after seeing a ghostly hand grab a coffee cup in a reflection which smashes a mirror and hearing his crackpot theory?  What???  It just comes off as dumb (and is even referened as ""stupid"" and ""idiotic"" from another character...so...maybe the writers knew what they were doing?).  Nah...a \*lot\* of the script is dreadful.

No doubt O'Rourke's unfortunate death post-production and prior to the movie's release and the awkardness of marketing the film certainly didn't help matters upon the film's release, but it can't be blamed for the quality of the movie.  Aside from the practical effects and seeing some of enjoyable actors, there's just not much to offer here unfortunately.",0,1734750610.0,horror,0,0.25,False

So there i was spending the last leave credit i have for the year. For your info I do go out once or twice a month depending on the level of stress i'm facing at the time. So on to the review...

The Place: Grand Emilia Hotel

When I checked in I was told i will be staying at the 3rd floor of the building which was fine until i was told there were no elevators. Sucks but can't do anything about it since the room has been paid for in advance. It was also already night time when i checked in and it was pouring. So up the stairs i go and checked the bath and made sure there was a tub because this is the 1 thing i am looking forward to in all of my stays. 

The tub wasn't as impressive as the one in Cebu R in Mabolo https://www.reddit.com/r/CebuHotelReviews/s/pyjeq5QbPS. This tub is deep but a little cramped If i stretch to my full length -I'm 5'0"". I noticed that the drain in the tub doesn't have any cover so i couldn't fill it with water. Went to dial 0 for front desk but no one was picking up. I didn't have any choice but to put my clothes back on. No one was at the counter but the security guard noticed me and he called the front desk lady. I told her there was no cover for the drain in the tub and she gave me this ""green stopper thingy"" you can see in the tub photos. 

Before I went back, I asked if 0 is the number for front desk (like every hotel I've stayed at) but she said it's not. She then gave me a 3 digit number to dial for front desk. This got me frustrated because in other places the front desk personnel will tell you to dial 0 if you need anything but this girl didn't bother to share that info upon check in. I myself assumed it was 0 since it has always been 0. Their room phone didn't have any instructions either. I also noticed there weren't any complimentary water in the room so i asked if there was free water and she pointed me to the water dispenser but lo and behold right beside it is a trash bin. 😱 I went back to my room to soak my frustration in the tub. 

Some of the other things I noticed in the room is the bed. The room is good for 2 people but it has a small bed. I don't know what size this is but it is small. I'm used to seeing a queen sized bed in rooms for 2 people. Like Cebu R Mabolo there were only 2 pillows on the bed too. The comforter is shorter than me so i had to remove it from being tied to the bed and use it lenghtwise.

The room has its usuals: table, chair, mirror and tv. There are no bottled water and no coffee making facility. The sleepers weren't ""hotel slippers"" but at least there was one (or two 🤭). The shower is not separate from the tub and the sink is tiny.

I was getting ready for bed and brushing my teeth when i noticed the hairs on the white faucet -last photo. I then wondered what else was not cleaned in the room.

Was originally planning to get a Breville Barista Express, but reviews here say the grinder is bad and should look at a separate espresso machine and grinder.

So, I started looking at Breville Bambino + Baratza Encore ESP. But looks like Breville Bambino Plus is much better.

Then also started seeing Breville Express Impress, but then its with a built-in grinder again... so is this one's grinder better than the Barista Express?

So I'm back where I was at. What should I get with my budget range? And if there are items slightly beyond my budget, I'm okay with those recommendations too. Will keep sipping coffee from my Ninja until then haha.

Let's face it, nobody wants to be known for having dragon breath. We all crave that minty-fresh confidence, the kind that lets us laugh freely and chat up close without a second thought. But what happens when a rogue popcorn kernel or an unfortunate tumble leads to a chipped or broken tooth? Could this dental mishap be the culprit behind a less-than-pleasant aroma wafting from your mouth? The answer, unfortunately, is a resounding yes. A broken tooth can indeed cause bad breath, and in this article, we’ll delve deep into the reasons why, exploring the nitty-gritty details and offering practical solutions to banish bad breath for good. So, buckle up, because we're about to embark on a journey to conquer the dreaded halitosis monster and reclaim your fresh-breath confidence!

Can a Broken Tooth Cause Bad Breath? Understanding the Connection
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We’ve all been there – a sudden, sharp pain, and a realization that something’s amiss in our mouth. A broken tooth. Now, besides the obvious discomfort and aesthetic concerns, there’s another potential consequence lurking: bad breath. But how, exactly, can a broken tooth lead to this unpleasant side effect? Well, picture this: a cracked or fractured tooth creates the perfect hideout for tiny food particles and bacteria. Think of it as a microscopic Grand Canyon in your mouth, harboring all sorts of unwelcome guests. These microscopic squatters feast on the trapped food debris, producing volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) – the very same compounds responsible for that dreaded rotten egg smell.

### The Breeding Ground for Bacteria

A broken tooth isn't just a cosmetic issue; it's an open invitation for bacteria to set up shop. The jagged edges and crevices act as tiny traps, collecting food particles that your toothbrush struggles to reach. This creates a breeding ground for bacteria, which thrive in this dark, moist, and food-rich environment. Imagine a bustling city of bacteria, multiplying and producing waste – and that waste is the source of the foul odor.

### Food Debris: The Bacterial Buffet

Think about your favorite all-you-can-eat buffet. Now, imagine that buffet crammed into the tiny crevices of your broken tooth. Not a pretty picture, right? That’s essentially what’s happening when food particles get lodged in a fractured tooth. These trapped morsels become a feast for bacteria, fueling their growth and leading to increased production of those nasty VSCs. It's a vicious cycle of food, bacteria, and bad breath.

Can a Broken Tooth Cause Bad Breath? Exploring Different Types of Breaks
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not all broken teeth are created equal. The severity of the break plays a significant role in how likely it is to cause bad breath. Let's break down the different types of tooth fractures and their potential impact on your breath freshness.

1. **Cracked Tooth:** This is like a hairline fracture in your tooth. While it might not be immediately noticeable, it can still harbor bacteria and contribute to bad breath. Think of it as a hidden pathway for bacteria to sneak in and cause trouble.
2. **Chipped Tooth:** A chipped tooth, especially if it involves a larger piece breaking off, creates a more obvious space for food and bacteria to accumulate. This increases the risk of bad breath significantly. It’s like leaving the door wide open for the halitosis party.
3. **Fractured Cusp:** This type of break involves the pointed chewing surface of your tooth. Because this area is directly involved in chewing, it’s even more susceptible to trapping food particles, making it a prime location for bad breath to develop. It’s like having a tiny food processor constantly grinding away, creating a perfect breeding ground for bacteria.

Can a Broken Tooth Cause Bad Breath? Preventing and Treating the Issue
----------------------------------------------------------------------

So, what can you do if a broken tooth is wreaking havoc on your breath? Thankfully, several solutions can help you banish bad breath and restore your confidence.

### First Aid for a Broken Tooth

- **Rinse your mouth:** Gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water to help clean the area and reduce bacteria. This is like giving your mouth a mini-detox.
- **Over-the-counter pain relief:** If you’re experiencing pain, take an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen.
- **Dental wax:** If the broken tooth has sharp edges, cover them with dental wax to prevent further irritation and protect your tongue and cheeks. This acts like a tiny bandage for your tooth.

### Long-Term Solutions

- **See a dentist ASAP:** This is the most crucial step! A dentist can assess the damage and recommend the appropriate treatment, whether it’s a filling, crown, or extraction. Don't let that broken tooth fester; get it fixed!
- **Maintain good oral hygiene:** Brush and floss regularly, paying extra attention to the area around the broken tooth. Think of your toothbrush and floss as your dynamic duo, fighting against the forces of bad breath.
- **Use an antibacterial mouthwash:** An antibacterial mouthwash can help kill bacteria and freshen your breath. It’s like a superhero swooping in to save the day, eliminating those odor-causing villains.
- **Consider a tongue scraper:** Your tongue can harbor bacteria too, so using a tongue scraper can help remove them and improve your breath. It’s like giving your tongue a deep clean, removing those hidden bacterial hideouts.

Beyond the Broken Tooth: Other Causes of Bad Breath
---------------------------------------------------

While a broken tooth can certainly contribute to bad breath, it’s important to remember that it’s not the only culprit. Several other factors can lead to halitosis, and it’s important to rule them out or address them alongside your dental issue.

- **Poor oral hygiene:** If you're not brushing and flossing regularly, plaque and bacteria can build up, leading to bad breath. It’s like letting your mouth become a bacterial playground.
- **Dry mouth:** Saliva helps wash away food particles and bacteria, so a dry mouth can lead to bad breath. It’s like having a desert in your mouth, where bacteria thrive.
- **Certain foods:** Foods like garlic, onions, and coffee can linger in your breath long after you’ve eaten them. They're like the bad-breath bandits, leaving their mark long after they’re gone.
- **Medical conditions:** Certain medical conditions, such as gum disease, diabetes, and acid reflux, can also contribute to bad breath. These are like the underlying villains, silently contributing to the problem.
- **Tobacco use:** Smoking or chewing tobacco can dry out your mouth and leave a lingering odor. It’s like adding fuel to the bad-breath fire.

When to Seek Professional Help
------------------------------

If your bad breath persists despite good oral hygiene practices, it's essential to see a dentist or doctor. Persistent bad breath could be a sign of a more serious underlying medical condition that requires professional attention. Don't brush it off – get it checked out!

Can a Broken Tooth Cause Bad Breath? The Bottom Line
----------------------------------------------------

So, can a broken tooth cause bad breath? Absolutely. It creates a haven for bacteria, which feast on trapped food particles and produce those foul-smelling VSCs. However, by practicing good oral hygiene, seeking prompt dental care, and addressing any underlying medical conditions, you can conquer the halitosis monster and enjoy fresh breath confidence once again. Don't let a broken tooth hold you back – take charge of your oral health and breathe easy!

Conclusion
----------

Bad breath, or halitosis, can be a real confidence killer. And as we've explored, a broken tooth can indeed be the sneaky culprit behind this unpleasant issue. It acts like a tiny, festering cave, providing the perfect environment for bacteria to thrive and produce those nasty sulfur compounds that give bad breath its signature stench. But don't despair! By understanding the connection between a broken tooth and bad breath, you can take proactive steps to address the problem. Remember, prompt dental care, meticulous oral hygiene, and addressing any underlying medical conditions are key to conquering bad breath and reclaiming your fresh-breath confidence.

As I started building them, I found out that the workflows were more similar than I may have realized. 

At the end of the day, an AI Agent could be your powerful virtual assistant, but instead of fetching your coffee (I wish), agents execute tasks autonomously—or semi-autonomously—with varying levels of complexity.

**We can break down these into certain levels of complexity:**

1. Level -1: Fixed Automation – The Digital Assembly Line
2. Level 0: LLM-Enhanced – Smarter, but Not Exactly Einstein
3. Level 1: ReAct – Reasoning Meets Action

1hj0m54,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1hj0m54/such_a_fool_smh/,Such a fool smh,"I’m 39 years old. I was a pill and then hard-core heroin addict for about eight years in my late 20s. It took me getting arrested to change my life around. Well when I got arrested for stealing some kayaks from a close out rental place over the winter And I got caught, it was the first time I ever got in trouble so I only had to do one year probation. And I was allowed to drink and go out with my friends and basically or anything I wanted except drugs. But guess what even though I had medicine to help me not want the drugs I still did the drugs thinking I would get away Like I always had or honestly not caring because I wanted it so bad. Well of course I got in trouble and got caught and was sent to county jail. After four months, I had a court date and they had given me a choice between going to prison or being released on drug court, which is an extensive five year probation involving all kinds of counseling, treatment centers, and meetings for narcotics anonymous. I had two more months to think about it. But I had already decided. I was literally sleeping on a cement floor under somebody else’s bed. With three guys in the room, the size of my bathroom locked and my head a foot and a half away from a toilet where people would go to the bathroom as I’m sleeping right next to it. It was disgusting, but that’s not what changed my mind. It was the time to think and how good I actually felt after a month or two. So I chose probation. I did 4 1/2 years of nonstop self improvement. After six months in jail, I did six months in rehab, and six months in a halfway house, which is basically rehab, but I could leave and get a job, then was forced to live in a sober living house, which is just 10 guys that are trying to stay clean with no staff or supervision or anything. We all looked out for each other and it was amazing experience. finally after those years and coming home after three months, I drank for the first time one night with a girl. And somebody told on me and I was immediately sent back to jail for what I thought would be a weak punishment which was the normal. Unfortunately, after a month of being there, I found out that I was going back to a halfway house for another six months, three hours away from my mother with cancer. I made the mistake of drinking that one time thinking I could get away with it. I still had that behavior. So I started my life over from South New Jersey all the way up as far as I could in North New Jersey. I had a cell phone a box of clothes and a $500.86 Buick I just bought. I went in two years. I had the nicest house I have ever lived in in my life and I was so proud of it. I saved up $8000 to buy a truck which was the first car I had ever picked out instead of just buying the first one that was cheap and appliable no matter how ugly it was. I searched for a month and picked out this truck specifically and saved up eight grand I have never had more than six or $700 or a big paycheck for $1000 in my entire life and it definitely never lasted more than a day or two. well, then I met my girlfriend. Well actually my wife now. She was an alcoholic drinking a big bottle of wine every night and I felt so bad for her because she would just cry and cry because she lost her father and her brother to Covid shortly before so I said she needs to grieve and it’s OK. but then there was physical violence and I let it go. The cops came so many times that my landlord paid me $1000 to move out of that house, which was the most important thing to me at that point and my biggest accomplishment and a symbol of what and how much work I have done to myself to improve. So we got a new house. Only five days living there we got into an argument and slammed my foot on the coffee table. that made it OK for her to throw a giant porcelain statue at my head and put a hole in the wall and then physically attack me and I allowed her to punch me about 20 times in the face. I ended up calling the cops on her that night and she got arrested. Her whole family, knowing how she is and her family is absolutely amazing to me and great people. Well, they came with about 20 people and cleaned all her stuff out a week later. she tried to go behind my back to the landlord and get herself off the lease and fuck me over for 2300 a month. And the landlord actually tried to do it because they didn’t know the law that it was a legally contract and since we were both on it, I had to agree to it and I told her no. She eventually came back and we worked on things. I ended up proposing. Drinking up more or at least continued. And it’s not so much to drinking it’s who she becomes when she gets too drunk, which is a completely violent aggressive person and it’s scary. I told her she had a good rehab or I wouldn’t marry her, which was the dumbest thing I’ve ever done because you can’t make somebody go to rehab if they don’t want to go. But she went for 30 days and came out like a little scared baby bird and she was amazing for a month and a half. The funny thing is we tried to get pregnant for about eight months and we were only intimate two times when she came home from rehab and got pregnant. So clearly it was the alcohol. oh, by the way we were pregnant about a year before and when she was a full-blown alcoholic. And managed to convince me that her going through withdrawal would be really bad for the baby. So I drove to the liquor store in tears every single night to buy her a bottle of wine and would only give her a certain amount. I literally bought my pregnant wife alcohol, and I will never forgive myself because we lost the baby. It got stuck in her tube and she had to have it removed. Well, after we got married and she went a year without drinking because she got lucky enough to get pregnant right after rehab that she didn’t have to do any work to stop drinking. She started drinking again after the wedding. That was a little over two years ago. And it has never stopped since. She drinks every two or three days and every time I see her drink I am so hurt because of the things that she has done when she gets too drunk or awful. I mean, literally hundreds of events where every single one just one would ruin a relationship. But I have stood by her and forgive her for everything. I’ve been a very great and supportive husband and an even better father. I have fully raised my 2 1/2-year-old son by myself while she sat there on the couch, drinking her wine. She’s gone now and she has my boy and her mother‘s basement and she does not give a fuck about that kid. He only interacts with me and he only listens to me. She cannot change him, feed him, or put him in the bed without crying, but if I say one word, he immediately walks to the room, happy as can be, and put himself on the changing table. I had to be a stern father to teach him some roles, but I do it in a proper way so that he learns, and he absolutely adores me. At one point, she was so black out, drunk, singing karaoke I saw this old guy talk to her, and then he followed her to her seat, which was right next to me at the bar. And they were talking I could not hear them over the music, but I thought it was kind of funny to tease her the next day about flirting with this older, weird guy so I videotaped it to mess with her the next day. All in good fun. He left and I thought I heard the word bathroom, but didn’t understand anything. Then she bought me a beer and a shot without ordering herself a drink which has never ever happened and never happened again. But I already had half a whiskey sour enough of a drink that I thought it was weird for her to order me more. Then she said she was going to the bathroom and that was weird, but then she turned around and told me Hey babe just relax and enjoy your drink. Don’t worry just chill out and enjoy it. It was at that point that it all hit me like a ton of bricks that she told that guy something about the bathroom and now she’s going to the bathroom and being weird trying to keep me in my seat. Well, I walked back there and saw her against the wall and him kissing her and her basically so drunk she was standing still And like an idiot I videotaped it for a second before I ran up and throw this 250 pound dude across 20 feet of tables and wrestled four bouncers 60 feet across the bar. It wasn’t until a few days later when I looked at the videos that when I caught her back there with him, she was rubbing him down there. And I watched that video 1000 times in pain. And all of a sudden it hit me what about the other video? And I looked at the video where she was sitting right next to me And I saw it. I saw her hand in a place no wife’s hands should be. And we were newlyweds. I never thought she was like that and she really is not like that but she was too drunk. I don’t have a problem with her having alcohol, but the issue is that she gets too drunk And turns into a different person when she’s drunk, which is violent and aggressive and malicious. And also that she drinks often. So one of those things need to change either not drink so often, not get so drunk, or figure out why you turn into the person you turn into when you’re super drunk. It’s been 2 1/2 years married, and she has never acknowledged. Alcohol has been an issue in our relationship. Well after numerous physical attacks that cheating thing six hour arguments to 5 AM about anything that pops in her ADD head. I finally told her that I had absolutely enough. A month ago she punched me again in the face And when I defended myself, she called the police on me except she got arrested lol. She was supposed to get out in two hours and had to stay 24 hours because she was pissing the police off. The judge issued her no contact with me for three weeks until court. Well, like a good husband I went down to the courthouse and made sure it was lifted as soon as possible, which was about five days. So her and my son can come home from her mothers damp stinky basement we had made plans to work on things during that time. Just small baby steps. One thing was that when we get into heated arguments that we both have to agree to allow either one of us to take a cool off. So it doesn’t escalate. She also was not supposed to drink until the baby went to bed which never happened. But after three good days home, we had our first heated argument And I stopped and said this is getting out of control and I don’t even know why we’re arguing actually so I’m gonna take a cool off. Period in the bedroom. She immediately ordered an Uber to go to a bar out of anger. And she had never done that in my entire knowing her. It was so hurtful for her to do that for the first time after coming back and working on things, and especially since it had to do with alcohol, made it 100 times worse. And knowing that she does things when she’s super drunk that she doesn’t do normally or even after just a couple drinks and that she often doesn’t remember things. I sat here for three hours scared out of my mind because if I saw her at a bar and I was single, I would be all over that because she’s a beautiful woman sitting at a bar by herself on a Tuesday night. She came home trashed. I told her the next morning how absolutely painful that was for me and I could not believe that she would do that for the first time. I forgave her kept trying to move forward, but she did it again two days later. What kind of wife would do that to someone who has been nothing but supportive and forgiving, and know that it hurts me so bad. Well, a couple days later I reached my end because we both had lost our jobs and we’re home alone for a month with the baby having to have them taken out of daycare. It made it very, very stressful looking for jobs both of us and not being successful and then dealing with the baby. But I love my son and I spend all day with him she ignores him. Well, I gave her an ultimatum basically even though I didn’t really see it that way at the time, but it was. I just told her that I had reached my limit. I have no more credit on my card of mercy and forgiveness. I just cannot live like this anymore and you’re drinking is absolutely ruining our marriage and our family. And I broke down and cried for 45 minutes, begging her to realize something. And she had the nerve to tell me that it was 1 AM and somehow it’s too late for me to have this conversation. Even though she doesn’t have a job and she was at the bar the night before until 245 lol. So I told her OK go get yourself some rest and think about it and hopefully you’ll have something to say it to me tomorrow because I want to say more tomorrow night but I don’t think there’s any point I think you already know how I feel and what I want to say so I will wait for you to respond somewhat. Well, the next day she had absolutely nothing to say And I’ll be honest I kind of ignored her for most of the day which is a shitty thing to do as a husband, but I didn’t know how to feel if I was upset, depressed angry I knew our marriage was almost over. I gave her no ammunition to fight with me that day. But when I wanted to go to ShopRite for gas coming over, she asked me to go to the liquor store and I said no I’m not contributing to it anymore especially after the talk we had the night prior. We got New an argument in front of the baby and he cried, and after about 10 seconds I picked him up and briefly swiftly walked out of the room and he stopped crying immediately and hugged me so hard because he scared of her. Well, the next day she decides to move out and take my son with her. She blames it on me arguing in front of our son, even though she has done it so so many times I can’t even count. And then she switches and blames it on me not showing her enough affection. But how could I? Every single other day she drank and was not herself. I was not looking for a long distance part-time relationship. Because my wife was not here every other day. And I felt like a prisoner in my own house. Because of how aggressive she gets, I literally have to hang out with her and pretend Everything is cool and laugh at her jokes and do anything she ask because God forbid I cross her in any tiny little way. It will be a five hour argument that I cannot stop because there is no reasoning with her. Or I can go hide in my room which also makes me a prisoner because I told her I don’t wanna be around her when she drinks and she said it was OK when she was sober of course but not anymore when she’s drunk. Or I can just drink with her myself and that way I don’t care. But either way every two days I cannot be my own self in a house I bust my ass for. And now she doesn’t wanna come back and she doesn’t even have a good reason. We had a plan when she left that we are both going to go to therapy and maybe in a month to come back and as long as we learn how to communicate then we can work on everything else together. But she doesn’t want to change drinking and she won’t admit it but it’s just so fucking clear. it’s unbelievable. And she can honestly say that she has not seen the effect. Alcohol has had on her family and our relationship from the beginning then she is mentally challenged. Alcohol is her coping mechanism for trauma. She’s been through, which is fine but if you don’t see the things that you’ve done to a loving husband that you would never do sober. It’s unbelievable to not change something that I’ve been begging for for two years. Just do it for a week even just approve me Wrong Anything, but nothing. And I am such a fool for thinking marriage was something serious because I told her I would never get married and I would never get divorced without being positive. But when we got pregnant, I knew I was OK spending the rest of my life with her and so we got married and I take it very very seriously. And she’s been separated for me for two weeks. I’ve been so supportive even trying to help her find new jobs new cars, a new place to live. I have literally been helping my wife leave me even though I want her back more than anything and that’s fucking love because I want her to be happy. Also, at the same time I’m not sure that she would actually do it. I think she’s trying to gain more control over me to allow her drinking because she refuses to acknowledge it or Address it. Well, last night I wrote her a long email as a last ditch effort over the last two weeks and unfortunately, I had the list quite a bit of things that she’s done and I could only list the things that she remembers and have talked about even though there’s so many more and so many worse. It was the hardest email I ever wrote in my life, and I had to do it because I could never say that to her in person. I knew it would hurt her. But I have tried everything And my last thing I could do was tough love and show her all the things that she’s done and explain how it has turned me into the person I am today. And she just took it as a full-blown attack and now her whole family thinks I’m a maniac and I’m crazy and I’m a schizophrenia And that I’m a liar. But her family knows nothing. And they’re too scared to stand up to her. The worst part is I still want her back because when she’s sober, she’s an amazing wife and does so much for me. But every time I see her poor a glass of wine I get angry at her because I take it as a sign of disrespect that she’s willing to take that chance every other night, knowing that the wine has caused every major issue in our relationship and everything that has hurt me badly she still chooses to do it and she chooses wine over this family and after I told her that it’s going to be over if she doesn’t stop, she still kept doing it. I feel so bad about the email, but I thought it would make her realize but of course I should’ve known better. I love this woman more than life itself, but I love my son more and the only thing I love more is my family. I’m 39 years old and after wasting half of my life, I realize that family is the most important thing to me and I had a good one when she wasn’t drinking. I had a great one. We had a great house and she left When I was unemployed with our rent being 2300 a month plus bills so she paid for December and basically gave me 2 1/2 weeks to come up with her half of the rent for January so I sold as much of my personal tools as I could Luckily started working today making cash on top of my little bit of unemployment so thank God for that and I told her that I’m going to bust my ass and working 80 hours a week so I can keep this house for the day that she might realize she wants to come home and work on things. And I’m doing that for myself so that I can look back in two years and not have to think that I could’ve worked a little harder, or I could’ve done a little more, or I could’ve been a little more patient. She is already fully committed to saying she doesn’t wanna work on things. And I literally just cannot wrap my head around somebody giving up on a marriage when she literally told me in person a few days ago that she loves me and she’s still in love with me, but she’s willing to start a whole new life and being a single mother at 40 instead of stopping drinking. I can never understand that but I guess I can because I used to be a heroin addict and I would’ve done anything I stole from my own mother so why wouldn’t she leave her husband? But the one thing I do know is that if I was doing something every other day that hurt her and she has been bringing it up every day for two years? I would 100% at least attempt to change. She cannot take accountability and she cannot emphasize with any of my feelings and it’s so painful that she is so lost and all I wanna do is help her but I can if she doesn’t want to help. And to now I lost my wife, I lost my son who is my whole world I’m very close to losing this house that has been on our family home since we got married and had a baby, I’m filing bankruptcy, losing at least one of my vehicles if not both. I suffer all the consequences. When she hit me went to jail and took the baby to her mother‘s. I was unemployed, so the baby could’ve stayed with me, but she automatically gets our boy even though she doesn’t give a shit about him I suffered. I even had to give her my car so she could bring him to daycare. I am I am the one that suffered, but yet I still love her for who she is as a regular person. But now I’m starting to realize that even as a regular person, she cannot admit her wrong doings so maybe she’s not who I thought she was. And it’s so hard to move on because almost all of her stuff is still in this house, I have not slept in the bed a single time since she left. I’m punished myself by sleeping on the couch every night alone. I cannot move because I can’t save up enough money for a new apartment down payment. I cannot afford the rent on a big three bedroom house for a family. I am trapped and she doesn’t care because caring would meet admitting what she’s done wrong and admitting she has an alcohol problem. It’s the worst thing to watch somebody slowly self sabotage the best thing in their life and I’m not trying to say I’m a perfect husband because I’ve ignored her for a whole day When I’m so upset and that’s something the husband never should do. I should’ve been man enough to just suck it up and give her some attention even though I was hurt. But I did not start this fire. She started the fire a long time ago and blames me for adding fuel to it so that she would drink more And she self sabotage everything. It’s the most painful thing but after almost 2 weeks alone, I can actually do my hobbies again that I couldn’t do with her. I can actually work in my garage for more than a half hour without a text, but the baby is crying because he doesn’t like being alone with her. I’m about to go to a bar tonight for the first time in four years without having to worry about how drunk she’s gonna get. Oh, did I mention that one night we got kicked out of the bar because she was too drunk and we had the baby with us playing pool and driving home. She wanted to go back and fight the bouncer a grown man lol my wife is 4 foot nine. And when I said no, she grabbed the steering wheel and I flipped out and I threw her drink out the window that she got to go. She immediately started punching me in the face as I was driving with our baby son in the backseat. That’s just one thing she’s done and I forgave her because I’ve learned to stop focusing on specific things and just see alcohol as one big issue all the things she’s done when she’s too drunk? I can’t think about them specifically anymore because there’s too many. It’s just one big issue that has been a cloud over our relationship since we met. And I’m honestly not even sure what to do. I want to wait for her for as long as I can Hoping that she’ll realize or maybe her family will help her realize but I honestly just don’t think she’s capable and I hate to not have faith in my wife, but after the pattern that I’ve seen any scientist would say that data speaks volumes and I can predict everything she does and everything she’s gonna do because she’s just a walking Robot Waiting for the next time to drink. I’m hopeless and I’m a really great guy and I’m a romantic and I’m sensitive and I’m extremely emotionally intelligent and I’m in touch with my emotions and I expressed my feelings but apparently I’m too complex for her because she cannot talk about how she feels. I bust my ass for my Family. I don’t do drugs I hardly ever drink. I have given her my entire heart mind and soul and she still has it unfortunately. I am still working as much as I can doing DoorDash and side jobs and just got a regular job so that I can pay so so much for an apartment I can’t afford so that one day she can come home even though I don’t think she is and she said she’s not. How do I know what to do because the second I move out, she’s gonna say that she was gonna come home just to fucking have power over me. It’s so sad and I feel so bad for her, but I feel even worse for myself and I’m angry at myself for letting it get this far thinking that she would realize after enough things the damage that she is doing. I messed up really bad and wasted over four years in my life and now there’s a little boy who was going to be living with divorced parents just like I did growing up. And the worst thing I remember is that every holiday I had to choose if I wanted to go with my dad to his family or with my mom to her family. Because I lived with my mom I went with her and I had always felt that I was hurting my dad‘s feeling so bad every holiday. I’ll never forget that and that’s my son is literally repeating my childhood, but my parents were at least kind of friends they spoke nicely to each other and I have a feeling that that’s not going to last very long between us, especially after the letter I wrote. I don’t even know if I want advice because everybody I’ve always asked her told me to leave her immediately after just telling one of our two of the things she’s done. But when you’re really in love, you’ll do anything and probably put up with anything, but maybe I’m just in love with the idea of her because when she’s sober, she is perfect for me beyond words. But if she’s not willing to say sober more than half of the time then how can I have my wife? How can I not be comfortable in my own home? This is the biggest decision I have to make to move on or to cling onto a little bit of hope that she’ll realize what she’s losing. Because as much as I don’t wanna say it, I have a great shot at getting a very good woman. I’m good looking I make a ton of money in my profession that’s only seasonal. I’ve had my own business. I have a big big beautiful house and two vehicles. I’m funny. I’m extremely intelligent. I’m charming And I’m a goofball and I can talk with the janitor at a restaurant with a little bit of Spanish, or I could sit at a table of hedgehog managers and keep up and not look stupid. I am well-versed and literally everything because all I do is read and I am such a good guy the way my mother raised me so I will be OK. I can’t imagine her finding a very good man in her condition And the way that she has let herself go physically and mentally on top of the fact that she’s back to living with her mother with no car, no job and a little boy that she doesn’t give a shit about. And it’s sad to say that about her, but I still love her. I don’t care how she looks, but other people will. The fact that I was letting her and helping her get a new apartment to leave me that’s real love because if that’s what she really really wanted I want her to be happy. But I know that’s not what she really wanted. She wanted to be back with me but not stop drinking and you can’t have your cake and eat it too. I can’t stand for it anymore. I know what I deserve. Because I know what I can offer which is a hell of a lot to any woman, so I deserve more than the bare minimum. So I don’t know how to fall out of love with her. I really wish she would make me hate her. I don’t know if she could.
I read a quote last week. It says a man’s loyalty commitment is tested when he has everything, but a woman’s loyalty has tested when that man has nothing. Well after almost a month out of work and stressing out all day on the computer about not getting a job and having bill collectors call , I gave her an ultimatum and then the next day she found one reason about me having an argument as an excuse to end this marriage, what acac coincidence it was the day after I said she has to stop drinking. I think that’s a little strange and she doesn’t even realize or she just believes her own lies or is so stubborn and thickheaded and selfish. The worst part is is that I had a feeling this would happen for a long time. And the worst thing I feel bad about is that For a long time, even though I was loving her and supporting her as hard as I could, we had a son that I loved even more and unfortunately, I had to videotape her at some of her worst moments as an insurance policy because I have no family and she has a huge family that will help her with the baby. And I knew that one day if we broke up, it would get bad and she would be vindictive and malicious like she always has and now I have proof if I want full custody, which I should have of the things that she’s done. She left the baby alone one day when I was at work and went out drunk, driving to get more liquor and she didn’t even make it three houses away before crossing lanes and heading a parked car. If she made it two blocks to the main road, I would’ve come home to no car no wife and a baby in the bed. So if I want full custody, I think this is one of the times that a father will get it. I do not want to keep him away from her mother his mother. Right now she is at her mother’s house with her God, her sister who is my son‘s godmother and they are all amazing people so I am comfortable, but when she gets her own house, I am terrified. Because with nobody there to stop her from drinking overboard, I don’t know what she’s capable of. And if she’s so easily physically violent with me, who’s to say that she won’t be violent with my son because he test her temper very badly and if she’s alone, she does not know how to handle it. She will literally yell at him to calm down, saying the words calm down and the meanest loudest voice she just doesn’t understand a two-year-old‘s brain. I really hope it doesn’t come to me ever showing the videos to anybody. I’m scared to even look at them. But if she ever tries to keep me from my son, I will show her one or two and tell her that I have many more and if she wants to go to court, I will gladly go to court for my son, but I continue to tell her that I am keeping this house in case she ever wants to come home and work on things, but she needs to get help first. We are both starting therapy this week, but as of now we are not going to work on things according to her I’m at a complete loss. I’ve lost myself. I’m only starting to feel a little better about being able to do things I couldn’t do before. I’m going to the gym, I’m reading books constantly. I’m researching constantly about roles. I may have played and my reactions to my emotions. I am working so so hard and I feel great about the things. I’ve accomplished only in two weeks, but yet my family is gone so nothing matters because that hole is there and nothing can fill it, but I will work my ass off to be a better man and to be happy with whatever life throws at me because honestly Everything that has ever happened to me is my fault. And as long as I take accountability for absolutely everything then I cannot have any anger anymore. I can only be upset at myself and work to improve the situation. If I continue to blame her, I will have anger and resentment, and I don’t wanna live with that so I am actually going to take blame for everything which I told her so that it is all on me to fix And if she doesn’t do her half it’s not going to be fixed. Anyway, if anybody actually read this whole thing God bless you honestly God bless you for somebody hearing my story because I can’t tell a single soul. I love you all and I wish you all the best for what you’re dealing with and I know some have it worse Especially as a man with a 4 foot nine wife people probably think I’m crazy but she has emotionally abuse me that I feel like I have PTSD and I still fucking love the girl I guess maybe I am the crazy one. I’m literally thinking it’s more and more possible every day. I’ve never really had mental issues like codependency or anything like that but I might have that syndrome where people fall in love with their kidnappers lol well anyway, thank you everybody and good luck feel free to comment.

1hj0h9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1hj0h9v/boyfriend_suffers_from_anxiety_and_dependency/,Boyfriend suffers from anxiety and dependency ,"
Hello everyone,

I’ve noticed many of you sharing your stories, so I thought I’d share mine to see if anyone has experienced something similar or has advice.

My boyfriend has been struggling with anxiety for over two years now. At first, it was manageable, though I had to support him constantly. He struggled with being alone—whether at home, traveling, or going somewhere by himself. I was fortunate to have a remote job, but even that didn’t make things easier. I often had to adjust my work hours, spending my days trying to comfort him—taking him out for coffee, keeping him company—only to work late into the night to make up for lost time.

After six months, I had to attend a three-day workshop in person. During this time, he became furious, and we fought every day when I came back because he couldn’t handle being alone. He didn’t have a job at the time, which added to his struggles.

Eventually, he found a job in another city, three hours away. I fully supported him, hoping this would help improve his anxiety. In the first two weeks, we stayed in a hotel, and I had to accompany him to work and during lunch breaks. We later moved to a house an hour from his job, but the routine continued. I still had to go with him to work and be there for lunch breaks, which meant spending five hours daily on his schedule while trying to manage my own remote work.

This constant support was draining me. I was exhausted, and on the rare occasions I showed my frustration, he would argue with me, insisting I shouldn’t feel upset. I started feeling like I was trapped, unable to do anything other than care for him, and it took all my energy. He would reassure me that this was temporary, but it has now been four months, and things have only gotten worse.

When he gets angry, he blames me for his anxiety and his situation. Later, when he calms down, he apologizes, but the pattern keeps repeating. I’m exhausted, emotionally drained, and desperately hoping we can have a day without fighting.

Now, with Christmas approaching, I told him I need to visit my family. At first, he says it’s okay, but then he gets angry, accusing me of abandoning him during a difficult time. He’s even begged me not to go, crying and saying he can’t be alone. He’s been seeing a therapist for a few months, but there’s been little improvement.

What worries me most is that he told me if I leave to visit my family, I might come back to find he’s hurt himself or worse. The pressure is overwhelming, and I feel completely stuck.

If anyone has advice or has been in a similar situation, I’d be so grateful to hear it. What can I do?

So I went by myself. I took the bus, cause the parking cost money and there is hardly any parking anyway. I got coffee at the corner store by me. I was really scared to go on my own. I felt like I looked stupid or like a loser. But no one there probably cared or even noticed. I was also scared cause like, I hate crowds and being touched and people never watch or control their kids and they usually run into me and I panic cause again I don't like crowds or being touched. I also was contacted by my r*pist recently so I had some anxiety thinking somehow someway I'd run into them and they would recognize me (they wouldn't I am literally a man now lol). They had some live music and it smelled like kettle corn so that was nice. I think I may have stepped in puke though? I asked some people at the bus stop what the bus fare was and stuff like that. I left the house, even though I was tired. Even though it would have been easier to stay home. I have chronic pain as well, so my feet do hurt and my back does too, but it would have hurt anyway even if I stayed on my butt at home. You aren't a loser for being alone or for being lonely. Loneliness is insanely common, especially since there are very few third places for young and lonely people to spend time. Even if you hate every second of it, try and leave your house. Try and ask a stranger for the time. Tell your bus driver to have a nice night. Go for a walk, see pretty lights,  it's okay to go through phases and stages of being lonely. It's normal to have periods in your life where you don't have many friends or any at all. We all have to play the rat race game and so many people are tired and stressed and broke. It makes it hard to connect. It's okay if you don't have it all together. Very few people do, and social media is just a small glimpse of people and their lives. We all get lonely and that's okay.

I’m going to not shop on Amazon, or purchase Starbucks until their strikes are over.

I know for parents with young kids during Christmas this can be complicated, and if you can’t honor their strike this can be a great educational opportunity. 

Do an art project with them about how things don’t magically appear that lots of people help make, move and distribute. It’s these workers who create the value for these large corporations. 

As far as coffee there’s a neighborhood grocery store that has fresh locally roasted beans that are more expensive and I’m gonna be treating myself to those. I usually by Starbucks at the grocery store when on sale or order coffee through Amazon.

I am tall woman who wears really high heels. My husband (M5'7) comes from a very short family. I decided my husband should have to climb a ladder in order to use cupboards in the kitchen, as the bottom row of cupboards are so far away from me, they look so tiny,  to use them i need to kneel down and crouch to look inside the tiny cupboards. My husband finds it more convenient and arousing to be inconvenienced by having to climb a ladder to get to the cupboards, as it helps him to feel submissive, he also likes extreme sports so him climbing a ladder to reach the upper set of cupoards without any kind of harness gives him his adrenaline fix.

Well, recently weve had his mother (5'2) staying with us and its been a nightmare, she keeps moving things around the kitchen so she can use them and says its rude to only leve things in the top cupbards so guests cant use them, my husband shut her down saying only ""my Empress's"" convenenience and comfort matters. 

I wanted a coffee and couldnt find a mug and it took me five minutes to find them, she had put them in the lower cupboard! crouching down was so difficult and hurt my back, which made me very snappy and irritable. When I challenged my MiL and she told me it was no big deal and she just wanted to be able to make a coffee without the danger of climbing to get everything.

I decided I had had enough, so I put my foot on her chest and pushed her down to the floor beneath me and held her there under my shoet, rubbing it across her body and face, asking her if she was ready to apologise, when she refused i got rougher, pressing harder and flattening her a little, she cried out and begged me to stop, but i kept going for longer and shoved my big toe in her mouth, which had to stretch to fit it. I asked again for my apology and she gave it, but I told her we werent finished and she had to lick the soles of my shoes clean,  shoving the sharp stilleto heel deep into her mouth.

I asked her for an apology and she said ""Sorry OP"", so i pushed down harder for a bit making her squeel and eased off and said ""Sorry what?"" ""Sorry Empress"" she wimpered.

My husband was delighted by this and has been asking me to retell the story in bed, but some of my friends Sarah (F5'9), Jessica (F5'10) and Siobhan (F6'1) says this all went a bit too far. So, AITA?",8,1734747629.0,AmITheAngel,9,0.79,False

# WHAT TO EXPECT: 

* Send an email, either with all the info filled out or just saying hi! Either is fine, it’ll start a convo! I usually respond that day, unless I’m very busy or my phone isn’t with me for some reason.
* We can work out what you want, I’ll come up with a pricing range, then you pick from that range depending on how much detail you would like, and what your budget is. 
* From there, we will work out a payment plan. Generally, we can split it up between any amount, but I will put you in the queue once half is paid. 
* Once you are in the queue, there may be a little waiting period. Fully depends on how many commissions I have at the time, or if you paid for a rush fee. 
* Once your commissions comes up in the queue, you will receive 3 very simple pose sketches, and pick from those which you like best (minor adjustments can be made)

   * Sketch (Here is the best time to fix any outfit/style changes, or simple fixes) 
   * Cleaned Lineart (if requested) 
   * Flat Colors
   * Shading under lines
   * Full Painted Render 
* At each of those steps small modifications can be made, but any major re-draws may cost extra depending on how far it sets the drawing process back.
* Generally, once I have the lineart/final sketch done, the piece will be ready within the next few days unless you have a rush job, in which case it can be done as soon as THAT day. 
* Once the full piece is okayed, (and the full payment is processed) I will send you the high resolution JPEG for PERSONAL USE, you do not own the rights to the piece, if you wish to purchase the rights, that can be discussed!

Today is another day, so I decide to pour myself a coffee and do my daily morning routine to get ready for the day. I boot up my 2012 Windows 8 laptop, which took a few minutes to get running fully. With coffee in my hand, I open my favorite place to talk to my friends from across the world and to share photos for my love for my white Rabbit. 

I check the server where my friends fawn over my love with me: ""Guys did you see it? Faker won worlds yet again! He got his 5th trophy last night!""

F-Faker...? HOLY SHIT, *that* guy from League of Legends?

Memories played like a trailer in my mind, bringing back ancient relics from the time I used to play League of Legends. I was a huge Faker fan, and it was mind blowing when he had won his third worlds in 2016. I was so inspired by the beast of a man, the humble Unkillable Demon King himself. I wanted to be like him one day, so back in 2016 I used to play a lot of League of Legends on this same laptop, playing mid lane.

I was incredibly good at it too, being at Diamond 1 within a month of playing. Unfortunately, I had to quit because I ended up joining a Special Response Team to train to be a special agent, and it's where I met the love of my life, fun fact. The game was easy; everyone I went against were completely trash, even in Diamond.

And to this day, the GOAT of League is **STILL** winning worlds trophies? I could not believe it! I decided to finally reinstall my favorite game back in the day. It only took me 10 hours with my connection and laptop, but I finally got it booted up.

I hop on a ranked game because that is the only reasonable thing to do after a multiple year hiatus. After a 10 minute loading screen (seriously, why did Riot remove seeing other people's loading bars; I wanted to flame who had the slow computer in my game), we finally get in. Of course, I am playing the big white statue himself in honor of my goat, Galio. 

2 minutes in and I got solo killed by a Zed with teleport over ignite. 

WOW! I was not expecting how good he was in Diamond; maybe he is actually Masters+ somehow playing in my elo because of decay?

I can come back. I saw Faker do the same in this situation even with the entire enemy team being different.

I died.

I died.

I died.

I died.

I died.

I died.

I died.

I died...

I died......

I DIED.........

# I DIED 💢💢😡😡🤬🤬🤬

I flipped my table, thus crushing my laptop into pieces. Red covered my entire body, tears flowed down my face. 

# THIS IS NOT LIKE ME 💢💢💢💢

However, in my unnatural fury, I heard a banging on my door. Five mysterous men entered my home, looking all huge and intimidating. Their relatively massive bodies overshadowed my tiny self. 

Wait, I think I recognize these people, but *how*? How did they become real?

The man with the shadow shurikens and a mask, who had handed my ass to me many times just now

Some weird undead red guy with a mask and two long blades

A fourth king who would not leave my lane all game

A small maniac obsessed with bombs who would make me believe every other minute that I was still drafted in war

And the other person who would not leave me alone, I have no clue why he was in the bottom, but the doctor himself who kept visiting me to throw cleavers all lane

What were they doing here, and why are they all looking at me with red eyes and a face of thirst? 😭😭😭💦💦💦

Red and black quickly flooded my vision.

I look up from the confusion of what had just happened to me:

The golden beams flowing through my room now gone, replaced with nothing but a dark white light.

Almost everything in my house was gone and pillaged away...

The big diamond wedding ring on my finger shattered into four pieces, losing its saturation and turning into a rusty grey color, exposing the fakeness of my ring, actually being made out of iron. The calendar on my wall was torn, showing that today's date was January 12 in the year 2000....but it's November, and how did my calendar show the year 2000 when it is currently 24 years after that? 

And why do I have a weird burning sensation deep inside my behind?

Most importantly, my white Rabbit, the love of my life, my future wife is gone! 😭💢

Yet I wonder, how did these people elos below me play way better than I could've ever fathomed?
