I’m a guy who’s building a life I’d be proud to share with someone. I’m looking for something real, long-term, and monogamous. The woman I'm drawn to values emotional intelligence, communication, and loyalty as much as I do.

I’m like gaming, drawing, reading, and cosplay. I’d love to find someone who might want to do couples cosplay with me someday! (Cloud x Tifa, Tidus x Yuna, or whatever inspires you) I’m working toward a Creative Writing MFA and plan to have at least two fantasy novels published within the next five years.

I’m slim-athletic and take good care of my appearance, health, and hygiene. Fitness and self-improvement matter to me, and I’m building a body I’ll feel confident cosplaying in.

For personality, I’m calm, fun, thoughtful, and a good communicator. My biggest flaw is that I sometimes overwork myself, but I’m actively learning balance.

Who I fall for:

A woman with a cute face, feminine energy, and expressive eyes. Someone soft, kind, and emotionally mature. I'm attracted to slim or athletic women who take care of themselves and have at least one hobby they’re passionate about. Think Tifa or Arwen, that's my type.

If bookstore or coffee shop dates, anime nights, and peaceful walks sound like your comfort, feel free to DM me.

There have been plenty of times when we’ve gone out for lunch or coffee or just some random outing and they either forgot their wallet or had the wrong card or something like that. I end up paying, they say they’ll pay me back, and then nothing ever happens. I honestly do think they’re scatterbrained, but it has happened so many times that it’s hard to believe they don’t remember even one thing they owe me for.

It happened again recently. We went to a gym and my friend couldn’t get in because they ran out of passes, so I used one of mine. They offered to pay me back and never did.

Now I’m wondering if I should say something and just ask to be paid back or even just bring up the pattern in general. I’ve known this person for years so it’s not like this is happening every day, but it has happened enough that it’s starting to get on my nerves.

1ozy193,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ozy193/aita_for_unintentionally_leaving_a_friend_out_of/,AITA for unintentionally leaving a friend out of hang outs?,"I have this close friend who I’ve known for years, and we are in a big group of friends that has been close since around middle school. I recently have been doing homework at my two friends’ house who live together. I’ve known them since I was born, and our families always go on trips together. We’ve always hung out like this. We get drinks or food and do our college assignments. This friend who I mentioned keeps checking our locations and when she notices im over at their house she gets really mad that we didn’t invite her. One thing though is that I always go over to their place pretty late at night, and she goes to bed early, around 10 pm, and she isn’t in college. We sometimes plan for things for extra early in the morning to grab breakfast, or a sunrise and coffee and we wouldn’t be able to invite her since she would be asleep when we plan it. We’ve also been watching dramas on the side and she isn’t one to watch shows or find interest in Netflix movies. Not every time we’d plan early morning but sometimes we just want it to be just us for the day, because she always makes us drop her off early.
I do feel bad though, since me and her are neighbors and live right next to each other. She’s told us before she doesn’t like it when we hang out without her but is it really wrong? We have 5 other people in the friend group, and it’s only when it’s specifically me and these two friends. She doesn’t react the same for the other friends when they hang out on their own. Maybe it’s because she’s also my neighbor. 

Recently we had a small fight where I was running late to a hangout we planned for dinner with her and about 4 others, and she got really mad about how I was late and yelled at only me at the top of her lungs until I burst into tears and had to be coerced to go back to the dinner. She was pointing out every flaw I had and told me how bad of a friend i was. She did apologize after, but I can’t see her the same anymore. 

Hopefully she doesn’t realize I turned off my location for her, I’ve honestly had enough of it. It sucks to know we have a trip planned later next year and I’ll have to spend two weeks with her (she has been threatening us on cancelling her flight though!) 

Anyways, whenever we try to reason with her it’s like arguing with a toxic girlfriend who takes everything you say out of context. 

Ex. “The flight tickets are cancellable if you really don’t want to come.”
“So you’re saying you dont want me to come?!?” 

It would always go like this, and it’s exhausting. Am I being inconsiderate?

1ozxyox,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ozxyox/prison_made_of_love/,Prison Made of Love,"Have you ever wondered which pain is harder to bear? Which one cuts deeper?
The person trapped behind bars, longing for a freedom he no longer owns—
unable to breathe fresh air whenever he desires,
unable to stand beneath the rain and let it wash over his skin
as if it could cleanse his sins and wipe away everything heavy,
unable to call out a beloved name the moment his heart aches for it,
unable to hear the birds under an open sky.

His hopes cling to the thin beam of light slipping through a crack,
or to those visits that, at least, are no longer in secret.

But what about the one who is free?
Who can taste the beauty of the world,
feel the changing seasons,
invite herself out for coffee when the heart grows heavy,
find comfort in music—
and yet she is a prisoner of her own emotions?

Have you ever thought about that?
How unbearably hard it is
when the thought of someone you loved—perhaps still love—
follows you everywhere?
When every moment holds their shadow?

Sometimes a single piece of music is enough
to turn your whole world upside down,
because something in its melody, in its words,
pulls his memory back to the surface
and makes your eyes burn with tears.

Or when, after a long exhausting week,
you pour yourself a glass of red wine
and suddenly remember your nights of love.
Or a street pushes you toward the weight of shared memories.
Or even at work, when your mind is fully focused,
one accidental glance from a stranger
reminds you of the one your heart still chooses.

Rain brings back the rain in his eyes,
snow recalls the cold days of separation and the bitterness of his words,
or maybe the warmth of his arms instead.

For me, you are as beautiful as the shapes the clouds draw in the sky.
Everything in nature turns my heart toward you.
My heart remembers everything—
and that is its curse.

Sometimes I wish my gaze on you,
on us,
hadn’t been so deep—
because it made me a captive of my own feelings.
But seeing deeply into people and moments
is part of who I am.
Maybe that’s why you thought I was dramatic—
because my words came from my heart and my soul.
Their power was born from the love I had for you,
and perhaps because I am the daughter of a poet.
You always forgot that my father wrote poetry.

You live in my thoughts, my dear stranger—
and sometimes that is painful,
and sometimes it is strangely sweet.

If you ask me which prisoner suffers more,
I’d say both.
In both their worlds, silence is the loudest song they hear each day.
Both fight for a freedom they’ve lost.

But do you know the difference?
The one behind bars is paying the price for a sin—
maybe he will be forgiven one day
and taste freedom again.

But the one imprisoned by her own heart,
what was her sin?
To love?
To entrust her heart to someone who felt like home?
That is a cruel punishment—
to be trapped inside your own memories
while your body walks free.

Whom must she forgive
to become childlike again—fearless, unbound?

I never thought my love could suffocate anyone—
or even myself.

And now that we’re speaking of prisons,
let me tell you this:
your silence, your absence,
this bitter separation—
it all reminds me of a cell.

I wish you would come visit me

Honestly, looking back now, it felt more like a long-term spiritual trial disguised as a job.

1. 'Analyzing deals' wasn’t the real job Outsiders imagine we sit elegantly evaluating transactions. Meanwhile, we were just trying to figure out: 'Will I sleep more than three hours tonight?' That was the only consistent analysis.
2. Nights didn’t end. They simply dissolved into the next morning A typical timeline looked like this: 11 PM — Client emails: 'Can you update the whole deck?' 1 AM — Boss: 'Does this model have any errors?' 3 AM — Legal: 'There’s a comma that shouldn’t be there.' 4 AM — I reconsider all my life choices 5 AM — My life choices reconsider me I used to think I could pull an all-nighter. Turns out I could pull several years of them. The only stable thing in the office was the coffee machine.
3. Excel basically ran the firm People think the MD is the boss. Wrong. Excel is the boss. Investment banking was Excel engineering plus PowerPoint design plus emotional damage. Excel never betrays you. It simply crashes at 4:57 AM when you didn’t save. Which is worse.
4. Every banker’s three illusions 'I might get off early tonight.' 'This client seems reasonable.' 'This revision should be the last one.' All false. Every time. The only truth was coffee.
5. Clients had their own optimism They would say: 'Can you compress these 60 pages into 6? But don’t remove anything. Make it cleaner. Make it deeper. And give me three versions.' At that point I no longer felt like a human, more like a stressed-out wizard doing PowerPoint magic.
6. Internal conversations were comedy Analyst: 'I finished it.' VP: 'Can you finish it again, but differently?' MD: 'Actually, I liked the first version.' That was the moment my soul left my body.
7. The strange romance of leaving the office at sunrise Most people see the sunrise on vacation. We saw it because the night simply ran out. Sunrise meant: 'Great, I can go home, shower, and come back again.'
8. Now that I’m semi-retired, I finally get it Looking back as someone who stepped away: The impossible always becomes more impossible once money is involved. Hitting your physical limit makes your mind sharper. A life with only work isn’t a life. Those years were exhausting, chaotic, unreasonable, but also real, intense, and unforgettable. Whenever I see a banking headline now, I just laugh quietly: 'Thank God I survived.'

My guess is we will also see Starbucks quality drop even more as they replicate what China does in their coffee wars currently going on and bring these changes to North America, the EU, etc.

For anyone new, I take Vegas lines/odds and convert them into projected fantasy points. Then I compare those projections against DraftKings, FanDuel and OwnersBox salaries to calculate a value score. This helps highlight who's overpriced and who’s underpriced.

Showdowns always bring more variance since the player pool is smaller and lineups tend to overlap, but hopefully this gives you another angle to work with.

I run an optimizer for every slate to identify the strongest builds. Since sharing full lineups is against T&C (and would just have everyone running the same thing anyway), here are a few core plays the optimizer is high on:

1ozxn2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1ozxn2o/laptop_internet_connection_issues/,Laptop internet connection issues,"Apologies in advance because I am not super tech savvy, but I'll try my best to give as much information as I can. Also, hopefully I've tagged this correctly. 

I have a HP pavilion laptop from I believe 2019 or 2020. It has a Intel core 15 (10th gen). 

Recently I've had issues connecting to the Wi-Fi at our house. I say that specifically because sometimes I go to a coffee shop and it seems to be fine so far, but I have a theory as to why, which I'll say down below.

I'll turn on my laptop - I don't use sleep mode - and my computer will decide that it has no capabilities of connecting to Wi-Fi. 

What I've done:

Checked the internet drivers and rolled back to a previous driver. 
Made sure everything was up to date. 
Tried restarting it 
turning it off and on completely. Letting it sit for various amounts of time from 5 minutes to 30 minutes. This works about 50% of the time. 
I stopped any programs (discord, for example) from autostarting on startup. 

I brought it into a local repair dude multiple times, and he's convinced that it's our router even though none of the other devices on our Wi-Fi have ever had issues (I specifically asked about this. He shrugged). He told me to turn off my router and turn it back on again while not touching my laptop. 

Well I've done that and nothing has improved. 

At the same time this has started, My laptop now takes anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour to turn off and often will sit there spinning, until finally a message of ""your device has run into an issue and has had to turn off"" or I've forced shut it down, which I know you're not supposed to do and I try not to. 

My pet theory mentioned above is that this issue is related to the power cord plug-in. Whenever my computer is plugged in, it 100% of the time will have this issue. When it's unplugged and I turn it on, it seems to only happen about 50% of the time. I think the reason that it works at the coffee shop is because I never use my charging cable in the coffee shop because there's no outlets where the chairs are. 

I would just not use my cord when my laptop is on, except my battery is also dying and I have to keep it plugged in all the time the laptop is on because it drains so fast.  

Why do I have this theory? When I was initially trying to fix it by myself I was in another subreddit and someone mentioned that their internet card was near the plug-in and the heat from the charging was causing the internet card to melt? But I don't remember what brand of laptop that was and I don't know if I understood actually what was going on. 

Please help - I have a lot of medical appointments on telehealth and I need a reliable laptop internet connection.

I just am too empathetic and I know logically that at least two people would be absolutely devastated if I died. Probably more than two people.

But this is my issue, right, my whole life (turning 30 next month) Ive lived my life for other people. For thirty years Ive been sticking around because OTHER people would be upset if I left. Not because life is so compelling I actively want to stay. 

If I were more selfish, I'd just do it. And my partner is asking me to be more selfish and put myself first - and I'm struggling to do it because it's just making me want to die. Put myself first??? Dude if I had been thinking about myself this whole time I would have succeeded my first suicide attempt and we wouldn't have even met.

I know I need to live my life for myself, not for other people, but it's hard to do that when it's the other people who want me to stay alive. It's just this passive way of going through life, hoping that someone notices me and wants me around because I don't want to be around because life is so hard. 

I'm just going round in circles. Time to add vodka to my coffee and reach for every bad coping mechanism today - because that's better than the alternative. (Not reaching for a coping mechanism at all)  ",1,1763426137.0,venting,1,1.0,False

the one benefit to singing on stage is that i dont stutter when i do so . im gonna stutter my tongue out of my mouth if i try to read out poetry in front of people . but its not even that that im really worried about , if that were the only issue then id just have someone else read out what i wrote for me . what really really gets me , is that im just nottt happy enough with anything ive written to put myself out there like that .

 im okay with posting what i write because i can edit it , delete it , & if people saw it ? it was undoubtedly only a handful of close friends & strangers ill never know , who cares . but if i share it at a reading ????

That’s not sarcasm, either; I actually had a very quiet evening. I lit a few candles for passed loved ones, spent an hour or so honoring their memories, then spent the rest of the night curled up by the fire reading with Jewel perched atop the back of the armchair. Howls in the forest made for a spooky backtrack.

It surprised me a bit that the Mechanic hadn’t asked anything of me that night. But apparently I’m ‘not ready’ yet. Considering [all the woodsmen I helped murder the weekend before Samhain](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/comments/1okjy3i/the_onceler_is_not_welcome_in_mercer_county/), that felt like an odd viewpoint. Self-admittedly, though, I do still hesitate sometimes, and obviously that would look bad for him in front of other Hunters. 

With Halloween past and the harvest season over, I no longer have a job at the farmstand. Chris told me I could come back in the spring when things start up again, but until then, I have to figure out another source of income. Thankfully, Sarah is a good person to know, and she said she’d pass my info on to anyone who needed some sewing done. Hemming pants, fixing curtains, little stuff like that. It won’t be much, I’m sure, but it’ll be something.

I took a little road trip this past weekend. Shocking that the Mechanic let me go, right? Well, there was a stipulation.

The week before I wanted to leave, I stopped by his shop to ask permission, since I’d be leaving the county.

“And just where is it you wanna go?” he asked, arms crossed as he leaned against the car he’d just finished repairing.

“New England,” I said, barely managing to maintain eye contact. He lifted an eyebrow at me, clearly expecting something more specific. “Boston area,” I muttered.

“Boston area,” he repeated. Turning, he began to put away his tools. “You goin’ to see Peanut Butter Boy?”

He thought this was about Skippy. If only. No, the reason I wanted to go north was much more somber than a social call.

By the way, Skippy, since I know you’re reading this, I’m sorry I wasn’t able to visit. I’ll see you after the annual turkey slaughtering festivities. Also, please don’t give me the dad lecture. I know what I did, and I absolutely regret it.

“Boston isn’t that close to Vermont,” I said, brows furrowed.

“It’s a lot closer than here.”

I sighed. “No, I do not intend to visit Skippy.”

“So what the fuck do you wanna go to New England for? Weather starts gettin’ nasty up there this time o’ year.”

“I’m aware. I’ll be sure to dress appropriately.”

“You haven’t answered my question.”

I hesitated. He probably wouldn’t consent unless I told him why I wanted to go, and if I did that, well… either he would allow it with repercussions, or he’d deny me outright. Finally, I said, “It’s a journey I’ve made every year for a long time, and I would like to be able to continue making it, now, and in future years. If you’ll allow it.”

His eyes narrowed at me. “Thought your wood maiden was dead?”

“She is. Am I not permitted to grieve her?”

“That’s what Samhain’s for, remembering the dead. That was last week.”

“And I lit a candle for her.” I chose my next words carefully. “But I would still like to be granted permission to make this journey.” 

“Fine,” he relented. “But not without an escort. And I’m busy next weekend.”

*An escort? Gods curse it.* Still, though, this wasn’t a no.

“So I can go if I take Briar or the Houndmaster with me?”

“Sure. Now get outta here so I can close up.” He shooed me out the door, and I started making my way home.

How was I going to convince one of the other Hunters to go with me? I still don’t know the Houndmaster that well, and Briar… is *Briar*. Maybe if there was a concert in the area next weekend? Something that would entice him into going, but maybe also keep him out of my hair?

When I got to my house, I looked up concerts near Boston. My jaw nearly hit the floor.

Kesha was having a concert in Boston the night I wanted to be there.

I couldn’t type fast enough as I messaged Briar. *Hey, Kesha’s having a concert in Boston next weekend. Wanna go?*

I could hear the sarcasm through the screen when he messaged me back. *With you? Don’t you break out in hives at the sight of glitter? You know what a Kesha concert is like, right?*

Rolling my eyes, I responded, *Sooo, you don’t want a free ticket to see Kesha?*

*Nothing is ‘free’. What do YOU want?*

*I want to go to Boston. Captain says I can’t go unless you or Houndmaster go with me. Is a concert ticket not enough to pay for babysitting? We can take my car, and I’ll make sure to keep you well caffeinated.*

He didn’t respond for a while after that, and I was starting to wonder if he might actually decline. But eventually he came back with, *Yeah, okay. When do we leave?*





It would take us nine hours to get to Boston, and since I suspected Briar would make frequent requests for caffeine stops, I figured it would be best to leave on Friday, find a place to stay for the night, and then maybe see some sights Saturday morning.

He met me at my place early on Friday, looking like he already needed a caffeine fix. 

As we settled into my car, he said, “Shotgun gets to pick music, right?” His hand reached for the radio.

Fucking Hells.

I intercepted him, covering the knobs of the stereo system with my hand. Giving him a stern look, I said, “I will let you control the music. Please don’t make me regret it.”

He waved a hand flippantly. “Yeah yeah. I’m not responsible for your regrets, though, those are all on you. Where are the snacks?” He popped open the glove box and started rifling through it.

Jesus, we hadn’t even left my driveway yet, let alone the county or even state.

Once we were on the road, Briar got bored of constantly flipping radio stations within the first hour, and decided to crawl into the backseat of my Impala. While I was driving down Interstate 80 at 75mph. Because that’s a reasonable thing to do when one is bored.

“Oooo, what’s in here? Sarah McLachlan?” he asked.

I glanced over as he climbed back into his seat with my old CD case.

“Believe it or not, no,” I told him.

He started flipping through it, expressing surprise at finding artists like Halsey, Pink, and Panic! At the Disco. Delicately plucking one out, he popped it into the player and started jamming. 

Before the album finished, Briar’s arm shot out at a sign for the next exit. “We need to stop here!”

Laughing, I raised my brows and said, “If you want some coffee, you just need to ask.”

He shook his head. “No, it’s not for coffee, but since you offered, yes, I want some.”

Already flicking on my turn signal to take the off-ramp, I asked, “If it’s not for coffee, why do we need to stop?”

“Did you not see the sign for the train cars?” he asked in return.

“You mean for Doolittle Station?”

“It said they have a *dragon*.”

“Yeah, and a restaurant, and ice cream, and mini golf. So?”

“And you wonder why I think you’re such a stick in the mud. *Come on*, Melon, live a little!” Briar cried. When I rolled to a stop at the end of the exit ramp, he turned to me, face serious. “Oh, I know what it is.”

I raised an eyebrow at him.

“You’re afraid of the dragons, aren’t you?”

“Should I have asked the Houndmaster to come with me, instead?”

“Y’know, you two would be well suited to each other. All *serious business*, no fun. And neither one of you wants to acknowledge the ray of sunshine I am in your lives.” He gasped as I pulled into Doolittle Station, pointing to a statue outside the ice cream parlour. “Look! They have a bigfoot! And he’s eating ice cream! You *know* the ice cream has to be good if bigfoot’s eating it.”

The irony of my chaperone being an actual toddler did not escape me.

We got ice cream, played a round of mini golf (he won), and watched the goats play for a little. I didn’t even chastise Briar when he fed one of the goats the remains of a second ice cream cone.

Overall, it only added about two hours to our trip. Which was fine. Except that it wasn’t the only roadside attraction he demanded to stop at. Suffice to say, it was good we left on Friday, because if we’d have made the trip on Saturday, he’d have missed the concert.

When we finally arrived in Boston sometime after midnight, we found a cheap motel to crash at. In the morning (and I use that term rather loosely), we did a few touristy things in Boston, including going to the Museum of Science.

I’m not sure Briar’s ever been in a museum where you can play with the exhibits before. The Captain might consider taking him down to Pittsburgh sometime and letting him explore some of the museums down there, allow him to work through his metaphorical zoomies. Then again… that *might* just fuel his imagination. But what else is a museum for if not to teach and inspire you?

After walking through an exhibit on Arctic Exploration, we rounded the corner and were met with a sign for the next one: The Science of Sound.

Briar’s eyes lit up before he quickly walked toward the closest display. I followed him to the oversized set of vertical pipes arrayed behind a button station. He pressed one, and a pipe glowed purple as a low tone resonated within it. A higher note rang from a different pipe as it glowed red when he pressed another button. As he started manically pressing the switches, I meandered to another section detailing the history of woodwind instruments. Cases containing various models showed how they’ve evolved over the centuries, from simple hollowed sticks with holes to intricate devices like bagpipes and uilleann pipes.

I almost jumped when Briar appeared at my shoulder. “Hey, I used to have one of those!” He pointed at the hornpipe I’d been reading about.

I smiled. “Did it get confiscated like all your other noisemakers?”

Frowning, he said, “No. I was entertaining the other passengers of a riverboat, and someone thought it would be a good idea to smack it out of my hands. It went overboard. So did he. Neither one came back up in the same condition. I could never get all the mud out of it.” His expression turned forlorn.

I didn’t ask what kind of condition the man who’d ruined Thorny Boi’s instrument came out in. Whatever had happened, he probably deserved it.

Probably.

We continued playing in the museum until it was almost time for the concert. I dropped Briar off at the venue with a “Have fun, pumpkin!”, then headed back out of the city. The small town I needed to go to was about half an hour past the city limits.

My fingers tapped the steering wheel impatiently as I waited for a light to turn green. Part of me dreaded doing this every year, but it felt like the thing to do, visiting Morgan’s grave on the anniversary of his death.

I want to warn yinz that the following introspection is mopey as shit, but I needed to get some stuff off my chest and I find writing to be cathartic. If you want to skip ahead to the part where Briar drags my weepy ass out of a graveyard, I understand.

By the time I arrived at the cemetery, it had begun to rain. I turned my face toward the sky as I got out of my car. Chilly drops spattered my cheeks. I pulled my scarf tighter, tucking it into my coat before grabbing the bottle of scotch I’d brought and setting off.

I walked among the gravestones in the murkiness of nightfall. The rain clouds darkened the landscape even further. After a few minutes’ walk, I came to the headstone I sought.

Sitting before the carved stone, I opened the scotch and poured a little out onto the grave before taking a swig for myself. I traced my fingers over the date of his death, then the date of his birth, before resting them over his name.

“I wasn’t sure I was going to make it this year.” My soft words were barely audible over the patter of water on stone. “I… made a rash decision a few months ago. I’m still not sure if I regret it or not. I probably should. It led to me…” I took a deep breath, tears pricking at my eyes. “I’ve done some pretty nasty things over the past few months.” The confession I was trying to make wasn’t ready to come out yet. I know I’ve told yinz all the horrible, gruesome shit I’ve done. But I hadn’t actually said the words *aloud* yet.

I poured a little more alcohol at the base of the headstone, then took a longer draught.

“I made a deal with a Wild Huntsman. That’s the rash decision I mentioned. I just… I didn’t know what to do with myself anymore. You’ve been gone for almost a decade now, and then that *fucking* development destroyed my wood maiden.” I put the bottle to my mouth again, taking two gulps this time, then pouring a little more for Morgan. “And then I learned another wood maiden was in danger, but I was too late to help her, too. I don’t know what I thought I could have done, or why I thought the Huntsman would be of any help. He doesn’t even like wood maidens. He *does* have a strong aversion to humans, though, and I guess I thought… I don’t know. That he might take an interest in someone who is angry enough with their fellow humans to do something about it? Seems silly in retrospect. But here I am. And there you still are. And I’ve no idea what happened to my wood maiden. I mean, I know, but I don’t *know*.”

I sat in silence for a moment, my thoughts shifting among all the tragedies I’ve experienced. If the Mechanic had been able to see into my head right then, he’d have had a field day. I lost track of how many offerings I made to Morgan, how many sips I took from that bottle, as I continued to ramble to my dead lover.

“Remember when you went on that mission to South Dakota, to help try and stop the pipeline? And you wouldn’t let me go because I was… oh, how did you put it? Too innocent, I think you said. Because if the job went sideways, I might have to kill someone, and you didn’t think I’d be able to.” I took a deep breath, letting it out as a soft laugh. “I was so mad at you. Called you all kinds of names. And you just kissed me on the forehead, told me you loved me, and said you’d see me in a week.”

There had been a number of such instances, where Morgan left me behind while he went off on some kind of eco-warrior mission. Each time, he would go on what I imagined to be some grand adventure, but he never told me exactly what happened on these excursions. After the first few times, it stopped bothering me that he wouldn’t let me come along. He didn’t share full details, but he shared enough that I became too scared to join him. I also saw the wounds he came back with, and wanted nothing to do with such violent things.

Morgan made sure I didn’t have to deal with the reality of how cruel the world could be. He sheltered and protected me from things such as rubber bullets and being drenched by a fire hose in freezing temperatures. My gentle soul was something to be shielded, he’d told me.

And after a childhood of being bullied and belittled for who I was, his fierce affection was a soothing balm. I was more than happy to let him treat me with fragile delicacy, even if that meant turning away from causes I saw as just; content to continue as I was, instead of learning how to defend or stand up for myself or others.

Something niggled at the edge of my thoughts, tenuous and hazy. My alcohol-addled mind couldn’t make sense of it, though.

“But you know what? I think you were right. I couldn’t have killed another human being, even if it was only in self-defense. Not back then. Now…” A heavy sigh left me as the alcohol I’d infused my bloodstream with began to break down the dam I’d been using to bottle everything up. “I’m not sure you’d recognize who I’ve become. That ‘too innocent’ young woman you loved is nearly gone. I’ve watched my soul darken in real time. The craziest thing is, I’m not even upset about it, because I don’t want to be that too innocent girl anymore. She got hurt too many times because she couldn’t protect herself or those she held dear. No, I want to be a confident woman with ambition and steel in her bones.”

The rain was coming down harder now, soaking my hair and seeping past my collar to sink through all my layers.

“The Huntsman has guided me toward that, in his own twisted way. He didn’t *start* me down this path, but he certainly gave me a good push once he saw where I might go. No, I took steps down that road before he even asked a single thing of me. My subconscious got me to murder three men, to impress him. And I wanted to impress him because,” I laughed at the absurdity of my words. “Because he reminded me of you. No regard for most humans. Possessive in his protectiveness. A warrior poet. Well, he’s more of a bard, but that point still stands. And so very fierce in defending what he sees as right.”

I raised the bottle to my lips again. The fiery liquid didn’t burn anymore, and I barely noticed the smoky aftertaste that lingered on my tongue. I’d had way more than was wise, but I couldn’t bring myself to care just then. That would be a problem for future Mel.

“I’m gonna do my best to keep coming back every year. But I don’t know if he’ll let me, the Huntsman. He doesn’t abide much by drawn-out grief. He’s more of a ‘take a second if you must, but then go burn those who wronged you to their roots, salt the remains, and move on with your life’ kind of guy. Feels like the only long-term grudge he’s held is against humans in general, and Gods help me, but I understand where he’s coming from on that front. Humans are just so…” I searched for the words to convey the disgust and disappointment I felt for others of my species. There really aren’t any, so I settled. “So shitty.”

A chill was starting to creep across my skin from sitting in the downpour. I ignored it. “Anyway… I don’t know if I’ll be able to come back for the next fifteen years. That’s how long I’ll be serving the Huntsman. And goodness knows what’ll happen to me after that. But he gave me this chance for what might be a last goodbye. I know I say goodbye every year, but this might actually be it. At least he gave me a better way to sing to you. You always liked when I sang to you.”

My fingers skittered over his name again. I poured out one more generous bit of scotch before following it with a fortifying gulp for myself.



*Maybe in another life, I could find you there.*

*Pulled away before your time; I can’t deal, it’s so unfair.*

*And it feels, and it feels like*

*Heaven’s so far away.*

*And it feels, and it feels like*

*The world has grown cold now that you’ve gone away.*



Tears mingled with raindrops on my cheeks. I let them run together.



*Leaving flowers on your grave*

*Shows that I still care.*

*But black roses and hail Mary’s*

*Can’t bring back what’s taken from me.*

*I reach to the sky*

*And call out your name.*

*Oh please let me trade. I would.*



Yinz can safely assume I was a sobbing mess by the time I finished my song. I curled up against the gravestone, though it did little to shield me from the downpour.

I was so embroiled in my grief I didn’t realize someone had approached until a figure was bending over me, pulling my arm over their shoulder to help me stand.

“Alright, that’s enough. Come on. If you get sick and die from exposure, the Captain’s gonna take it out on me.”

Briar helped my drunk ass back to the Impala, where he buckled me into the passenger seat before getting behind the wheel. “Where are the keys?”

I fumbled through my pockets, then put them in his outstretched hand.

“Why aren’t you at the concert?” I slurred.

He side-eyed me as he pulled out of the graveyard. “It ended *hours* ago.”

“And you didn’t find anyone to go home with?”

“Okay, first off, if I didn’t have the draugr to shower with affectionate torment, I could go home with anyone I wanted. Secondly, you’re nosy.”

“Says a guy who routinely goes through people’s minds like a book,” I muttered before reopening my bottle of scotch to take a pull.

He glanced at me, and if I didn’t know better, I’d say he was concerned. “Y’know, it would have been easier to just mainline that if you wanted to turn your blood into booze. Haven’t you had enough of that already?”

“No. Haven’t faded away yet. Still have to face facts.” I stifled a shiver as rainwater dripped off my hair.

“... what?”

“‘S not easy facing up when your whole world is black.”

“Did you just quote the Stones at me? Jesus, gimme that.” He reached over and took the bottle. I let him have it. Holding it up, he commented, “I hope this wasn’t full when you started. You’ll be dealing with alcohol poisoning along with hypothermia.”

He set the bottle behind his seat, where I couldn’t easily reach it, then cranked the heat. I put my clammy fingers over the vents.

“How much did you hear?” I eventually muttered.

“More than I wanted to.”

“How long were you listening for?” I insisted.

A pause, then, “I heard you say how shitty humans are.”

It took a few seconds for that to sink in. My mind was pretty muddled. “You sat through my weepy song without interrupting?” Shit, I might start crying again.

“Yeah, you’re welcome,” he said tartly.

“I should get you a whole case of moxie, since we’re up here.”

“I haven’t decided if I like it yet or not.”

“All the reason to get you more. Maybe you can come to a decision sometime this decade.”

We drove in silence for a bit. Then my body began to air its grievances about the amount of scotch I’d consumed. “Please pull over,” I said.

He glanced at me. “We’re five minutes from the motel, what do you want me to pull over for?”

“Yeah, I’m not gonna make that. Please don’t make me puke out the window.”

Grumbling, he flicked the hazards on and stopped on the side of the road. I fumbled the car door open, and made it three feet from the car before my stomach violently forced out its contents.

I just want to say, Briar would make the best sorority girl. He might be a bit of a bully sometimes, but damn if he didn’t stand there and hold my hair back.

When I stopped dry heaving, he asked dryly, “You good now? I’d like to be able to take a nap at least before we have to drive back home. Because judging by how your body just rejected that alcohol like DiCaprio rejects any woman over the age of twenty, I’m gonna be the one driving.”

Nodding, I stood, knees trembling. “Yeah, I’m good. Great, even. Tony the Tiger, baby.”

I know I’ve been typing this all out like I remember it clearly, but my memories of that night are actually pretty fuzzy. I like to think he laughed at my shitty joke, though.

Anyway, we crashed at a cheap motel again, I puked four more times before finally getting three hours of sleep, and we left for home at the crack of dawn. Briar stopped to get me some Pedialyte, and when I opened my mouth to argue that I wasn’t a child, he interrupted me. 

“No, you clearly are a child, and you’re going to drink this. Now, bottom’s up, sweetie, or I’m gonna get a funnel, too.”

I also got two cases of moxie for Briar on our way out of New England, figuring it was the least I could do after all he’d done.

Somehow, I managed to pass out for over half the return trip, despite Briar cranking the tunes.

When I woke, the car was creeping past a statue of a shaggy brown humanoid creature with an ice cream cone.

“Are we at Doolittle Station again?” I croaked.

“I want ice cream, and since you tried to drink yourself into a grave, I’m in charge now. Cope.”

I groaned, pulling my scarf over my face.

He parked the car and tugged my scarf back down. “Come on, Melon. I’m going to offer you the chance to redeem yourself at mini golf.”

Arm over my eyes to keep out the glaring, migraine-inducing light of a cloudy November day, I said, “I concede. You can mark my score down as 100. Whatever it takes to let you leave me here to sleep.”

My door opened, and he dragged my grumbling ass out, steering me toward the ice cream stand. “Nope. First ice cream, then mini golf. You need fresh air.”

“Okay, fine, but no ice cream for me. I’m gonna be sick again if I have any dairy.”

In case you’re wondering, no, I’m not any better at mini golf while hungover.

When at last we pulled into my driveway, Briar actually followed me into my house and made me a cup of tea before tucking me into bed with a “Sleep well, pumpkin!”. If the state of my kitchen hadn’t been a mess of rummaged-through tea boxes and empty moxie cans, I would have thought I dreamt it all. Maybe I did, though, I don’t know.

Jewel fussed over me the next morning, distressed that a Huntsman had brought me home in such a state of fatigue and disorder. I assured her he was just being nice. That didn’t stop her from fretting, though. She was probably right to, honestly. While I hadn’t actually looked in a mirror this morning, I knew I looked like Hell. Still had a pounding headache, too. Not sure I’ve ever had a two-day hangover before. Of course, I could also be coming down with something after sitting in the freezing rain for a couple hours.

Though I dearly wished I could stay under my cozy quilt, I’d picked up curtains from someone last week, and they expected to have them hemmed and back by Wednesday. I also had my lesson with the nøkk this evening.

As I molded my headache into a migraine with the whirring of my sewing machine, I debated if I should just skip today’s violin lesson. But it would be the second time in as many months, and the nøkk had been surprisingly displeased the last time I’d cancelled a lesson. Presumably, it was the audacity to continue changing our arrangement, because there was no way he was growing fond of me.

No, it would be best to grit my teeth and deal with it. My playing wasn’t even that screechy anymore.

In preparation for dealing with the pretentious water spirit, I gave myself three hours to take a nap, have some tea, and pop some ibuprofen. As I sat nursing the tea, I stared at the roses on my table, still as fresh as the day the Mechanic had given them to me. The seeping crimson had slowed its pace since the logging incident, but they grew redder by the day nevertheless.

My brows furrowed as I stroked the silken petals. Assuming my theory was correct, the change in color was an indicator of the darkness in my soul– the darkness the Mechanic had pointed out the day we sealed our bargain– and how it had grown. How *I* had grown.

My breath caught in my chest. I’ve undergone quite the transformation since I’ve come here, and if the remaining white was anything to go by, I wasn’t done changing yet.

But I wasn’t stagnant.

No, as dark and twisted of a manner as it was, I’d grown over the past half year. More than I think I have during any other point in my life. *Especially* when I’d been with Morgan.

When I’d met him, I was shy and withdrawn and avoided most people at all costs. That hadn’t changed by the time he died, and he had in fact encouraged me to stay that way. Not explicitly, but in the way he adored me, telling me he loved me just the way I was. Which sounds romantic on the surface. And if I had already become who I was meant to be, I think it would have been.

But I could have been so much more, if the one I cherished and looked up to had encouraged me to improve myself instead of telling me I was perfect and putting me on a shelf like a pretty doll.

The Huntsman, on the other hand, had pushed me to more. Granted, it was down a twisting left-hand path, but for once, I felt like I was working toward something. Like I had a purpose.

I had been content with Morgan, certainly, and he showered me with affection. But had I truly felt *fulfilled?*

Looking back, I’m not so sure anymore.

Shaking my head, I finished the rest of my tea and left for my violin lesson, craving the crisp, fortifying air of a November night.

There’s really not much to report in regards to lessons. The nøkk is still stuck up, I’m still very okay at playing, and I’m still sick of What the Water Gave Me, which I guess he thought would be funny to make me learn on the violin. Asshole.

As I made my way home in the dark of early night, I continued to mull over my earlier thoughts. They whirled around like the dry leaves in the breeze around me. Maybe I was overreacting to my revelation. What if I was misremembering? But no, every time I’d asked Morgan to teach me some self-defense, he’d brushed me off.

I was so absorbed in my thoughts I didn’t realize someone was on my porch until I reached my door. The Dragonfly leaned next to it.

“Good evening, Huntsman,” I greeted warily.

“Evenin’, Little Fox,” he said, a little too loudly. “Have a nice trip?”

Ugh. I did *not* need my headache added to right now.

“It went fine, but if you’ll excuse me, it was a long journey, and I’m still recovering. I’m not in a state to be hosting guests this evening.” I tried to slip in the house without him following me, but found his boot blocking the door when I tried to close it. Sighing, I pulled the door back to let him in. Before I could find a candle and matches, he flicked on the lights, bathing the room in a brightness my hungover brain was not prepared for after the soothing darkness outside. I made a note to myself to remove the bulbs after he left.

“Briar says you didn’t go to the concert with him,” the Mechanic said as he followed me to the kitchen, still talking at an unreasonable volume.

“Given my current situation, I could only afford one ticket, and I have zero interest in being in a crush of people wearing next to nothing and coated in glitter,” I responded. Pretty sure I’m going to be finding glitter in my car for years, and I’d found several specks of it in my hair, despite having showered.

The stove clicked a few times before the soft *whoosh* of flames ignited beneath the kettle. My maliciously mischievous visitor settled himself against the counter next to me as I reached into the cabinet where I kept my tea. As soon as I pulled a box of chamomile out, he flicked the door shut. It barely missed my nose as it snapped sharply closed. The cardboard tea box caved as my hand clenched.

“I have this under control, if you’d like to take a seat,” I said through gritted teeth.

“You said you weren’t feelin’ well, so I thought I’d give ya a hand.” He grinned at me.

I glared at him, then opened the cabinet again to get the honey and look for some patience. Honey I had in abundance; patience was something I tended to be short on.

He tried to slam the cupboard door a second time, but I made sure to keep a firm grip on it. I closed it softly, then turned to him. “These cabinets are rather old, and I would appreciate it if you didn’t manhandle them. I don’t want to have to explain to my landlord why the doors are cracked.”

Eyes twinkling, he said, “Fair enough. So what were you doin’ while Briar was at the concert?”

“I’m sure he already told you, so why are you asking me?”

“Because I want to hear from you why you thought it was a good idea to sit in a downpour gettin’ so drunk you couldn’t stand.” His smile had disappeared, and his eyes burned into me.

I turned away to retrieve a pair of mugs. Once I added enough honey to mine, I slid the second cup and the jar of sweetness down the counter to him, along with a tea bag. “It wasn’t, and I never thought it was. I just… got a little carried away,” I muttered.

Flashes of emotion from my crying session flickered through me. They swirled with my earlier introspection about how Morgan had really treated me, becoming a wave of grief. But this was a new flavor of sorrow. One tasting of regret rather than mere sadness.

The Mechanic’s voice drifted into my ear, soft this time, but far more pernicious. “I was thinkin’ of never lettin’ you leave this county again, but if this is how you’re gonna come back, drowning in grief,” he chuckled quietly, then inhaled deeply, seeming to drink in my sorrow. “Hell, maybe I’ll take you up to his grave myself next year.”

I took a steadying breath, smoothed down my bristling emotions. “Take it in while you can right now, because this grief has run its course.”

I winced, suppressing the urge to cover my ears as the second half of my sentence came out with what I can only describe as feedback from a mic. Tears pricked at my eyes from the harshness of it.

The Huntsman flinched at the high-pitched keening, then demanded, “What the fuck was that?”

“You tell me!” I exclaimed. “It came from the vocal cords *you* gave me.” At least, I was pretty sure it had. I’ve developed a bit of a sense for which is which, since my natural ones aren’t affected by salt or hagstones.

We eyed each other, neither of us able to make sense of what had just happened.

“You tryin’ to lie to me?” he finally asked.

“I am not. You know what it sounds like when I try to tell a lie. My voice becomes less, not… whatever the fuck that was.” But if he thought I was lying, and I knew I was telling the truth… what *would* that sound like? “You actually think I’m trying to lie,” I said, laughing.

His eyes narrowed. “You mean *you* think you’re tellin’ the truth.”

“I am.” I squeezed my eyes shut as the feedback rang out again, competing with the steaming kettle. “My mother lives in Denver,” I said, voice turning flat and hollow as the vocal cords he’d given me cut out. “*That’s* what a lie sounds like. It seems to me that what happened was… a disagreement.” I removed the pot and poured us each a cup of tea.

He joined me as I sat at the table. “You really think you’re over your beau?”

I nodded slowly. “If I’m not already, I will be in a day or two.”

“‘Bout fuckin’ time,” he commented. After taking a sip of his tea, he added, “Been what, ten years?”

Letting the steam from my cup warm my face, I replied, “Does it matter anymore? It won’t be another ten.”

“Here I thought it might take a couple years to beat it out of ya.”

I smirked. *~~Threaten me with a good time.~~* After taking a sip of tea, I retrieved a candle and some matches.

“I can’t take this light anymore. Hope you don’t mind.” Before I turned it out, though, I did notice that only one rose had any white left, a gleaming spot about the size of a dime.

*Five down, one to go,* I thought.

*What will it take to get me there?*

Turning my gaze to him, I asked, “Why haven’t the roses you gave me wilted?”

He grinned. “‘Cause you been takin’ good care of ‘em.”

I shook my head. “I’ve kept plenty of cut flowers over the years, and I have *never* seen any stay fresh like this. Longest I’ve been able to keep flowers is three weeks, and even then, they deteriorated. It’s been over two months, and they look like they were cut this morning.”

“Of all the things to ask about, you’re gonna ask why they won’t wilt? Ain’t you concerned ‘bout ‘em changin’ color?”

“Of course I am,” I said. “And just because I *know* it’ll delight you to hear me say this, it drove me crazy for weeks, wondering if I was imagining it, then contemplating what it might mean when I realized I wasn’t. But if I asked you why they turned red, would you tell me?”

“Probably not,” he admitted.

“Right, so why bother asking?”

He only sipped his tea.

I shifted tactics, going for more direct. “How did you connect them to my soul?” I asked. “Was it the blood? Or something else?”

“So clever of you to figure that out,” he said, the corner of his mouth curling up. “Too bad you weren’t clever enough to keep yourself from givin’ me the rope to hang you with.”

I choked on my drink. “What the fuck does that mean?” I rasped once my coughing fit ended.

He shrugged and gave me a wink. “You’ll find out soon enough.”

As if I hadn’t already been on enough of a mental roller coaster this weekend, he had to drag it into this week, too. Because of course I’ve been fretting over his words (just like he intended, I’m sure).

Does it mean he has my name? But he said *I* gave him the means, and I’m not sure what I’ve explicitly said that would tip him off. Unless he means letting him into my memories of Morgan, where he got my nickname. Maybe that led him to naming me.

No, I can’t think like that. He hasn’t actually named me yet, and there’s always a chance he’s just playing mind games.

1ozxin1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ozxin1/aitah_for_making_a_respectful_stink_about_a/,AITAH for making a respectful stink about a candle near the cat food bowls?,"Long story *not* short, my (29F) and my bf’s (35M)roommates (my bfs brother and wife) had marital issues before they moved in and through grief and family loss, they ended up moving in with us. It didn’t take long for their marital issues to bleed into our business and more importantly the whole block of neighbors when they’d scream outside. Now it is a full on estate drama situation which makes the stress even worse. 

I’m pretty sure I remember my one stipulation when they moved in was no candles, considering my house burned down and I’ve banned them in my life ever since. They understood that and respected it, my bfs and his bro’s mom didn’t like them growing up they were ok with it, so I thought, until recently. 

Yes my history comes into play, but even more important then that, we have 3 cats and a dog, they have 1 cat and a big puppy. The amount of cats in my lifetime that have gotten their tails singed, too many to count on 1 hand. Whether from cat chase or dog chase, as a cat family you know *anything* can happen quickly. Also, my sister’s cat whom happens to be my youngest cats sister (so same body, same fluffy tail), she recently got burned by a candle and is still missing fur. People were close by EVERY single time, you have like 2 seconds to react before it can go bad. I also think I remember the roomates saying their cat got singed by a candle before, but my memory can’t confirm. 

This is the second time I’ve caught the roommate burning a candle on the 6in wide ledge next to where the cat bowls are. She’s sitting on the couch with a coffee table tucked close in at least 12 feet away. She wouldn’t have the reaction time needed if one of our cats, god forbid our monster fluff ball orange boi recklessly chased one of the ladies up to that ledge….like they do DOZENS of times a day. 

I blew the candle out on her and said something like “I may freak out if this stays on, the cat traffic here, this is the most dangerous spot with cats” before she interrupted and said it’s ok and how they’re just gonna light it again later.  

I live in a constant state of hyper vigilance around them-on edge and riled up to the point I can’t properly communicate with them half the time-yes violence and threats from them multiple times is what led up to this- so I haven’t talked to them or engaged crap in so long to keep my peace. It’s worked for a while despite hearing their constant bitching about things. It’s like ever since the state was eyeing their marriage after one crazy night months ago, my bf and I became public enemy #1. In fact I threatened to cut off their privileges to my car after that night because of how violent and rude the brother was. (He attacked my bf). I said if he did it again I will make him stick to his word about using my car (he said he was done and detailed it drunkenly and left my keys on top of it the whole time after he attacked my bf). Wifey didn’t like that so she herself said thanks but no thanks we’re done using your car. Then I was the enemy…..

Anyways, after blowing out the candle, I walked away and calmly said “respectfully, please”, and hid in my room. I don’t interact and it’s been a while since things have heated up. They have free rein of the house while we are mostly confined to our room, the kitchen and the basement. Our stuff included, as it keeps going missing and rearranged. I got rid of stuff for them to move in and be able to take all of their excess old furniture and knick knacks. The one bin I had of personal belongings in the basement was dumped and left on the couch. 

I’m rambling on anyways, but simply, AITA for worrying about a dangerously placed candle? ",1,1763425934.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

So, I'm a bachelor in biochemistry, huge fan of any kind of science, mostly neurobiology, (because it is great having a lab inside my own brain that I don't need to pay a rent for) and some fundamental stuff like ""how did god created?"" (nobody cares, why, though, me included🥰). Got plenty of hobbies like games, films, anime, but from something interesting I've got a greenhouse inside my dorm room, just bought Arduino to build another one for moss✨

Also a big lover of fermentation. Any kind. Alcohol, milk products, coffee (hate the stuff, but the deepness of taste is amazing), wanna try making a beer one day, when I get some space.

As I am overwhelmed by the ideas sometimes, it does not matter, because changes come next in most of the time, so I'm opened to hear your craziest thoughts on any kind of stuff, even if you figured out, how to mine a Moon without anyone noticing and make billions.

Anyway, I'm glad that you read it till that point, if so - feel free to DM, just don't say ""Hi"", say something fun about yourself - your favorite manga, what pizza do you hate the most, do you love spiders or no - just something, otherwise it is easy to see you as a bot.

1ozxdda,https://i.redd.it/okx20ovhtw1g1.jpeg,"Reborn: I Stopped Saving His ""Fearless"" Darling","He kneels. She walks away.
Because once you've died for love, you learn—it's better to live for power.

Chapter 1
He killed me on my birthday.
Because his precious ""fearless girl"" jumped off a building—and he blamed me.
But when I opened my eyes again... it was the day before she died.
This time, I didn't stop her.
I let her serve desserts at a corporate dinner, call herself a ""fearless girl,"" and replace a $100k wine bottle with a toy.
While they burned, I smiled. And recorded everything.
At the board meeting, he tried to push the blame on me.
So I hit play.
By the time the video ended, his career, his reputation, and his ""fearless girl"" were all finished.
Now I'm the CEO—and they're begging at my feet.
Second chances aren't for love. They're for revenge.
--
My boyfriend's childhood sweetheart, Henrietta Finley, declared herself the ""fearless girl"" every single day.
She messed up a wire transfer to our vendor by repeatedly entering the wrong passwords, locking the company account.
Yet, she just laughed it off.
""Yeah, it was my mistake, but I only got two numbers wrong! I'm still the best!""
After sending the wrong designs to the printer and ruining half a million dollars' worth of products, she actually pumped her fist in pride.
""Okay, the team has to work overtime to fix it, but I'm still awesome!""
I brought it up with my boyfriend, Clifford Mosley, a few times.
He always said, ""She's learning from her mistakes. Let her grow.""
Then came the dinner with an important client.
Henrietta secretly swapped the formal menu with a selection of childish dishes—mango smoothie bowls, caramel custard, and sweet milk rolls.
It was completely unsuitable for a professional business dinner, so I quickly had the restaurant revert to the original appropriate menu. We successfully secured the 10-million-dollar deal.
But after dinner, Henrietta ran to Clifford, crying, ""I planned the menu all by myself! I'm the bravest! Why did she change everything? She stole my moment! She's so evil.""
Clifford was so upset that he wanted to make her a director to make her feel better. I refused.
Henrietta went out drinking that night, got into trouble, and jumped from a building.
Clifford blamed me entirely.
On my birthday, he had me tied to a chair. ""This is your fault,"" he said. ""You're going to pay for what happened to her.""
He force-fed me until I died.
When I opened my eyes, I was back on the day of that fateful dinner.
This time, I'd let his ""fearless girl"" have all the spotlight she wanted.
\*\*\*
""Rina, I'll go ahead to Savoy Bistro to check the private room. Join us when you're done.""
Henrietta's voice was sweet at the door.
I stiffly looked up at her innocent face and knew I had been reborn.
This was the same day when we had the corporate dinner with Cyrus Harriman of Rietta Group.
In my previous life, she'd changed my menu to kid-friendly desserts like mango smoothie bowls, caramel custard, and sweet milk rolls.
I found it unacceptable and urgently contacted the restaurant manager to change the menu back to proper business standards.
The $10 million deal was secured, and the whole company celebrated.
But Henrietta complained through tears that I stole her credit.
Clifford was heartbroken and immediately wanted to promote her to project director as compensation.
How could I possibly agree?
In one year, she'd locked the corporate account by botching a payment to our vendor and ruined 500,000 dollars' worth of inventory by sending the wrong files to our printer.
How could anyone not see these as colossal failures?
After every catastrophe, she'd just proudly shake her little fist and proclaim herself the ""fearless girl"".
And Clifford would just smile and say, ""She's learning from her mistakes. Let her grow.""
Putting someone like that in a director role would run the company we'd spent eight years building.
I couldn't just watch it happen.
Feeling wronged, Henrietta went out drinking that night, got violated by those men, and jumped from a building.
When Clifford got the news, he didn't yell at me. He was even more considerate than usual.
I thought our ten years together meant something and that it was different.
We'd lived on bread together during the startup phase, crammed into a tiny basement apartment.
Later, we shared magazine covers after making it big. We'd been through everything.
On my birthday, he said he had a surprise for me.
The surprise was that his bodyguards had me tied to a chair.
His eyes were bloodshot, his face contorted as he screamed at me, ""Sabrina! It's all your fault! If you hadn't blocked Hattie's promotion, she'd still be alive!
""You were just jealous! Afraid she'd take your spot!
""You monster! You owe her! You should die with her!""
Then, smiling, he force-fed me until I died.
The searing pain when my stomach burst remained etched in my very essence.
My knuckles turned white where I gripped my phone.
""Rina, I'm heading to the airport to pick up Mr. Harriman. I'll drop Hattie off on the way.""
Clifford's voice pulled me from my thoughts.
He walked to the door, casually draping an arm around Henrietta's shoulders.
""Get to Savoy Bistro early. You really connected with Mr. Harriman. Don't be late.""
Henrietta leaned into Clifford, making a face at me, her eyes flashing with a hint of challenge.
""Yeah, Rina, don't be late! We are off now!""
Clifford laughed, catching her hand where it rested on his shoulder, a gesture that was natural, familiar.
In my past life, I was truly a fool, mistaking this blatant flirtation for mere innocent closeness.
Suppressing the hatred churning inside me, I looked up and gave them both a calm smile.
""Okay, don't let me keep you. Get there safe.""
If Clifford was determined to risk our entire company just to indulge his childhood sweetheart, why shouldn't I let them have enough fun?
Chapter 2
I got my hair and makeup done at a salon downstairs and arrived at the restaurant half an hour early.
The private room at Savoy Bistro was opulent and grand, exuding an air of exclusive luxury.
The thought of this very room soon being filled with those childish dishes almost made me laugh aloud.
Before long, Clifford arrived with Cyrus from Rietta Group.
I immediately stepped forward with a smile. ""Mr. Harriman, I hope your journey was pleasant.""
My pleasantries were flawlessly delivered, and Cyrus's smile seemed genuinely warm.
Just then, the door to the private room burst open.
Henrietta charged in, clutching two bags of potato chips, crunching as she entered.
A sudden silence fell over the room.
Cyrus's brow furrowed almost imperceptibly.
Henrietta's outfit today was a sight: dramatic pink eyeshadow, a massive matching bow in her hair, ripped jeans that were more shreds than denim, and open-toed sandals.
The tote bag slung over her shoulder, cluttered with various blind box figurines, jangled loudly with her every move, a jarring noise in the refined setting.
In my past life, I'd suppressed my anger and forced her to change into formal attire, for which she later complained bitterly about me to Clifford.
This time, I couldn't be bothered to caution her.
""Mr. Harriman, hello! I'm Henrietta Finley!""
She thrust out a hand casually, a few chip crumbs still clinging to the corner of her mouth.
Cyrus's eyes lingered on her for seconds, his frown deepening. He made no move to take her hand.
An awkward silence stretched.
Clifford hurriedly intervened. ""Mr. Harriman, this is my assistant. She's young, very spirited.""
Cyrus finally made a noncommittal sound and gave Henrietta's fingertips the briefest of touches.
""The young lady seems lively,"" he said, his tone dismissive.
Henrietta immediately puffed out her chest, looking immensely pleased with herself. ""You have great taste, Mr. Harriman! I'm a fearless girl!""
""Fearless?"" Cyrus looked baffled. ""Mr. Mosley, why did she say that?""
He clearly didn't understand.
Clifford's face flushed red. He quickly changed the subject. ""Ahem, it's her favorite hobbyhorse. Mr. Harriman, shall we take our seats?""
Watching Clifford's discomfort gave me a sharp sense of satisfaction.
I deliberately engaged Cyrus in a bit more small talk about recent industry trends, lingering at the back.
True to form, the impatient Henrietta bounded ahead and plopped herself directly into the seat of honor facing the door.
Acting as if she owned the place, she patted the chair beside her brightly. ""Come on, everyone, sit down! Don't stand on ceremony!""
My eyebrow twitched. That was the seat of honor, reserved for Cyrus.
I noticed Clifford frown, who was about to speak.
I cut in before he could, my tone firm. ""Hattie, that seat is for Mr. Harriman. Please find another.""
Henrietta hated it when I told her what to do. If Clifford had asked, she might have complied.
Just as I anticipated, her rebellious streak flared instantly.
Her lower lip jutted out in a pout, and she turned pleading eyes to Clifford. ""Cliff, the airflow from the vent is best here. It's nice and cool. I want to sit here.""
Clifford, recognizing the inappropriateness, managed a semblance of sternness. ""Hattie, be reasonable. Mr. Harriman is our guest of honor. Let him have the seat.""
His voice held no real reproof.
Cyrus, ever the smooth talker, just chuckled and waved it off. ""Ah, don't worry about it! Young people these days don't bother with all that. If she likes the spot, just let her be. Keep things relaxed!""
His words were gracious, but the smile didn't quite reach his eyes.
Chapter 3
Henrietta, taking his polite dismissal at face value, beamed. ""Well, if Mr. Harriman says it's okay, then I won't stand on ceremony!""
She stuck her tongue out playfully at Clifford, looking immensely pleased with herself.
Clifford gazed at her with pure fondness, shaking his head with a sigh. ""Hurry up and thank Mr. Harriman.""
""Thank you, Mr. Harriman!""
Cyrus gave a tight, perfunctory smile and waved a dismissive hand. ""It's fine, really.""
He took another seat, his movements carrying a hint of stiffness he tried to conceal.
I sneered inwardly, ""Clifford must have lost his mind.
""He actually took a mere social nicety as permission and let Henrietta keep the seat of honor.""
In my past life, I'd forced Henrietta to change clothes, making her arrive slightly later, so this particular scene hadn't occurred.
This time, she kept surprising me.
As everyone settled in, Clifford signaled waiters to begin serving.
I raised my glass, hiding my smile behind it.
The real show was finally starting.
The first course arrived, presented solemnly under a silver cloche.
The server lifted the lid, revealing golden, pillowy, sweet milk rolls, still steaming and dusted with sugar.
Cyrus, who had just picked up his fork, paused.
The smile on Clifford's face froze for a second before he forced a laugh. ""Appetizers! Just some appetizers, Mr. Harriman! The main courses are coming up.""
Then came the second course and the third.
Chocolate muffins, French fries, sticky toffee puddings, and apple crumbles...
Plate after plate of saccharine, kid-friendly fare kept arriving in a relentless procession.
Cyrus's expression darkened visibly.
He leaned back in his chair, folding his arms across his chest, not touching his utensils again.
A cold sweat was beading on Clifford's temple. He finally sensed something was terribly wrong. He stopped a waiter. ""What are the remaining dishes?""
""There's still a dessert course, sir,"" the server replied politely. ""Shall I serve the mango smoothie bowls now?""
""What?!""
Clifford's voice cracked.
He shot a panicked look at Cyrus's stony face and scrambled to his feet. ""There must be a mistake! I'll go find the manager right now!""
He rushed out.
""But the order's correct!""
Henrietta piped up, her face the picture of innocence, clearly expecting praise. ""Cliff, I changed the menu!""
She turned her proud, expectant gaze to Cyrus. ""Mr. Harriman, these are all my favorite dishes! I especially ordered them to share with you!""
In my last life, I'd changed the menu beforehand, so I'd missed this spectacular display of foolishness.
Witnessing it now was both infuriating and darkly amusing.
She probably thought she was being unconventional and creative.
She likely assumed a man like Cyrus, used to fine dining, would be delighted by these childish treats.
But she completely failed to understand that at this level of business entertaining, the meal itself was never the point.
For a multi-million dollar partnership, serving filet mignon or lobster thermidor wasn't about the food itself.
It was a necessary demonstration of respect for the client and a reflection of the company's credibility and stature.
With her pitifully limited intellect, she probably couldn't grasp this concept in two lifetimes.
Clifford wasn't a complete fool. He knew exactly how badly Henrietta had messed up.
He turned and glared at her sharply. ""Hattie, stop this nonsense!""
Henrietta's face fell immediately at his scolding, her lips trembling as she looked utterly wounded.
Cyrus's expression was thunderous. His secretary, unable to contain himself, slammed his fork down on the table.
He stood up, fixing a cold stare on Clifford.
""Mr. Mosley, is this some kind of joke? Serving us kiddie menu items for a business dinner with Mr. Harriman?""
His eyes swept over the table, and he let out a contemptuous snort.
""Does this entire spread even cost 300 dollars?
""Is your company going bankrupt soon?""
Chapter 4
Cyrus's secretary, who had been with him for over five years, essentially served as his spokesperson.
He routinely voiced the criticisms Cyrus preferred not to state directly.
Clifford clearly understood this. Seeing Cyrus remain silently seated while his secretary attacked spoke volumes.
He scrambled to his feet, bowing repeatedly toward Cyrus. ""Mr. Harriman, this is all a huge misunderstanding! Hattie is new here. She doesn't know the protocols.
""Please, don't take her ignorance to heart.
""Our budget is fully prepared, and our sincerity is beyond question! I'll arrange a proper menu at once!""
The secretary snorted derisively, pressing his attack. ""New? Mr. Mosley, is that your company's demonstration of 'sincerity'? Letting a newcomer occupy the seat of honor?
""Or is your firm so lacking that you can't field a single competent representative besides her?""
Henrietta, recognizing herself as the target, immediately straightened up defiantly. ""What's wrong with being new? I'm the fearless girl!""
A stunned silence swallowed the private room.
I almost spat out my coffee.
I sneered inwardly, ""Fearless girl?
""Did she completely lose her mind? Her childish antics might be indulged within the office, but to behave this way in front of a major client? Did she mistake this high-stakes negotiation for a game?""
Cyrus gave a sudden, choked cough, his face turning thunderous.
The secretary's expression was priceless. He struggled for a moment before finding his voice. ""Fearless girl?
""Mr. Mosley! Are you out of your mind? Bringing an unprofessional girl to a meeting of this importance!
""Do you take Mr. Harriman for a fool, or do you hold the entire Rietta Group in contempt?!""
The accusation of disrespecting the Rietta Group carried immense weight.
Rietta Group was the industry titan. Everyone fought tooth and nail for their business.
An opportunity to dine with Cyrus was priceless.
Without my uncle's personal referral, Clifford wouldn't have even gotten this meeting.
True panic dawned on Clifford's face. He whirled around and snarled at Henrietta, ""Shut your mouth! Don't say another word!""
He then turned back to Cyrus, his torso bending deeply. ""Mr. Harriman, the fault is entirely mine! My preparations were insufficient!
""I will have the entire meal replaced immediately. Please, I implore you, grant us another chance!""
He kept throwing frantic glances at Henrietta. ""Hattie, quick! Get that vintage Bordeaux wine!""
Henrietta looked bewildered. ""What?""
""The Bordeaux wine! The one I instructed you to bring!
""Hurry up!""
Henrietta's gaze became evasive. She muttered unwillingly, ""But ... you said we'd present it after the deal was finalized... Right now, it's...""
""It's intended for Mr. Harriman, regardless! The timing is irrelevant!""
Clifford's patience was gone. ""Just hand it over!""
Moving with excruciating slowness, Henrietta rummaged in her oversized bag and produced an ornate wooden box.
Clifford's face strained into an overly bright smile. ""Mr. Harriman, this is the wine once collected by the legendary vintner, Elvin Greene!
""I heard you appreciate the finer things. I called in countless favors and spent 100,000 dollars to acquire this for your collection. Please, do us the honor!""
When Cyrus heard the name, his stern expression finally showed a flicker of interest.
Elvin's collection of vintages was legendary, with each surviving bottle being exceptionally rare and valuable.
A genuine piece would signify a thoughtfully prepared gift.
Henrietta approached, carrying the gift box as if it were leaden.
The box was crafted from polished oak with brass fittings, its impeccable craftsmanship signaling immense value.
Clifford continued his lavish praise nearby. ""This bottle comes from a legendary vintage, aged in French oak barrels for decades. The label features an original art print, truly capturing the romanticism of the countryside...""
He had managed to capture the room's anticipation. Even I pretended keen interest.
Observing that familiar box, I could no longer restrain the smile touching my lips.
I knew precisely what ""masterpiece"" lay within.
I cast a significant look toward Henrietta.
The moment of reckoning had arrived.
Under the collective expectant gaze, Clifford impatiently flipped open the clasp on the wooden box.
In the very next instant, everyone in the room stared, their eyes widening in unified disbelief.
Chapter 5
As the box lid lifted, it revealed a pink toy with a wide, goofy grin.
It lay nestled in the custom-fit silk cushion meant for the vintage Bordeaux wine, looking utterly out of place.
A frozen silence gripped the room.
The brilliant smile on Clifford's face solidified into a rigid mask.
Cyrus's expression, which had just begun to soften, turned to dark fury.
""Disgraceful!"" he spat through clenched teeth, turning on his heel to leave.
""Mr. Harriman!"" Clifford, panicked, leaped forward to block his path. ""A mistake! This is a mistake! She must have grabbed the wrong box!""
A vein throbbed on his temple as he glared furiously at Henrietta. ""Where is the wine? The wine I told you to bring!""
Henrietta flinched under his intense stare.
""Cliff, I'm sorry... I accidentally broke it...""
Clifford looked dumbfounded.
Henrietta, however, seemed to think she deserved praise. She held up the plastic figure. ""But I put my favorite collectible in there instead!""
""Cliff, look! I'm amazing, right?""
Clifford grabbed her wrist, his voice shaking. ""When did this happen? Why didn't you tell me?""
""Yesterday! I just hadn't found the right time to say anything!"" Henrietta pouted, defending herself. ""I tried really hard! I ordered a replacement online right away, but the shipping was slow.
""Then I thought this limited edition figure is so popular right now! I'm sure Mr. Harriman would love it too!""
Clifford looked like he was about to have a stroke. ""That wine cost 100,000 dollars! This is a cheap plastic toy! Henrietta, have you completely lost your mind?""
""Why are you yelling at me?"" Her tears began falling like rain. ""I didn't mean to break it! I was trying to fix things! Why are you being so mean to me?""
Seeing her tear-streaked face, Clifford instantly relented.
Conflict flickered across his face before his voice softened. ""Alright, alright, don't cry. I'm not really yelling at you. I just... I just panicked.""
There they stood, in the middle of the room, one sobbing pathetically, the other fumbling to comfort her, completely absorbed in their own little drama.
It was quite the spectacle.
In my past life, I'd salvaged the situation by presenting the vintage Bordeaux wine from my father's personal collection to placate Cyrus.
This time, I wouldn't lift a finger.
Cyrus and his secretary watched, utterly dumbfounded.
They were here for a business negotiation, not a soap opera.
Cyrus's patience finally snapped. He shot a disgusted look at the couple and strode decisively toward the elevators.
Clifford was desperate to stop him, but a glance at the hyperventilating Henrietta rooted him to the spot.
Sweating profusely, he finally cast a pleading look my way. ""Rina! You have a good rapport with Mr. Harriman. Quick, go calm him down! I need to get Hattie settled first!""
I nodded and immediately followed. I slipped into the elevator car just as the doors were closing, smoothly pressing the ""open"" button at the last second.
I would certainly calm Cyrus down.
I would even secure the deal with great care.
But it wouldn't have anything to do with Clifford.
""Mr. Harriman,"" I began, my tone apologetic yet confident.
""They both acted very unprofessionally. My apologies for the spectacle.
""Why don't we discuss this deal face-to-face?""

I’ve always heard that going for a walk would help, especially since my lifestyle is pretty sedentary — but I always kinda blew it off. How much can a walk actually help?

Three days ago, I decided to go for a walk in the morning just for the hell of it — and had a great day. Like a really good day. And I think other people noticed too, because the people at the coffee shop I frequent were much nicer to me than they usually are. (They aren’t mean, obviously, but that day they were REALLY kind). 

So the next day, I went for another walk. Again, another great day.

Today, is Monday so I went back to work, and work kinda bummed me out. So I went for a walk. And now it’s as if the bad day hasn’t even happened.

The difference is astounding. My mental health has shot upwards. I look in the mirror and think that I look a little better. I’m less irritable. Like usually my weekends don’t feel restful at all, and yet this past one I felt rejuvenated. Maybe I was vitamin D deficient lol.

Turns out the thing missing in my life was an hour walk a day. Who knew?

1ozx9e0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ozx9e0,Parking Pass Exposed Them in MY Bed—Cheaters Don't Deserve SHIT!,"My bestie Liley was about to leave when I yanked open the hallway cabinet drawer to grab her a couple of visitor parking passes.


But my hand fumbled around in there forever—only touched one lonely pass.


""Huh?"" My chest tightened.


""What's wrong?"" Riley asked.


""There's only one pass left."" I shook my head instinctively. ""Wait, that doesn't make sense. Nobody's been over this month. I literally saw four of these when I cleaned up earlier.""


I pulled out my phone and called my husband Ryker Daven. ""Hey, did we have anyone over this month? The parking passes are missing.""


There was a pause on the other end, then his warm laugh came through.""Parking passes? Oh, I probably forgot to pick up new ones this month, babe.""


""Mm-hmm.""


He kept going: ""Oh, and you're still doing your usual Wednesday night at your mom's, right? I'll fill up your tank beforehand.""


I hung up and turned to Liley.


""Ryker's cheating on me.""


Liley stared at me, her voice trembling.""Mila, are you sure? What if it's just a misunderstanding?""


""He lied."" I shook my head. ""He didn't forget to pick up new ones. He gave three passes to someone else.""


My heart was a wreck, but my brain was Ice-cold clear.


I had to know what the hell was going on.


""Liley, don't leave yet. Come with me to the security office.""


Down at the security office, the old guard on duty was nodding off at his desk.


I told him I needed to check the usage records for our parking passes this month.


""What's the point? A pass gets used, it gets used."" He waved me off like I was wasting his time.


I pulled two hundred bucks out of my wallet and slid it under his thermos.


His eyes shot open.""Check it? Hell yeah! Let me grab that logbook for you right now.""


He flipped open this thick-ass ledger and jabbed his finger at one line. ""Here—Building 12, Unit 601. That's you. All four passes used this month. One on the 7th, one on the 14th, one on the 21st. And one today.""


The 7th. The 14th. The 21st.


Every single Wednesday.


Every single day I was at my mom's.


My fists clenched without me even realizing it.


""Can you tell me which car? Any plate numbers?""


He shook his head. ""We just take the passes, miss. Don't track who uses 'em. Too many cars coming through.""


Dead end.


But now I knew—every Wednesday I left, someone else showed up.


After Liley left, I stood alone in our apartment.


This place Ryker and I built together, piece by piece—it made me want to puke.


My family never wanted me to marry him.


My parents said he had no drive, no ambition.


But I loved him stubbornly, and there was no one else I would ever marry.


That's why I went home every week to spend the evening and night with my parents—just to keep the peace.


We only had one car. Ryker drove it to work, and I only took it on Wednesdays.


At first, I actually felt guilty—like I was abandoning him because my family looked down on him.


Turns out? The day I left was his perfect window to fuck someone else.


The second that hit me, I ran to the bathroom and threw up into the toilet.


At nine that night, the lock clicked.


Ryker walked in looking beat, holding some fancy gift box.


""Babe, I'm back! God, I'm exhausted.""


He kicked off his shoes and handed me the car keys. ""Filled your tank. Oh—and I got you something. That scarf brand you're obsessed with.""


I took the keys and the box. Didn't open it.


He launched into this whole animated story about the wedding—how he covered for his boss, how crazy the reception was, on and on.


He was so into his own bullshit. I just sat there watching him, feeling this cold, sick weight settle in my chest.


Something ugly was forming in my head, and I didn't want to look at it.


I didn't even know if he'd actually been at that wedding.


He went to shower and took his phone with him.


Lately he'd been glued to that thing—bathroom, shower, didn't matter.


I yanked the scarf into the bedroom and shoved it toward the closet, but my hand slammed into something in the back. I ripped it out—a box. And when I opened it…


What I saw inside made me freeze.


Chapter 2


I stood there, frozen. My blood was boiling.


Inside the box, lying there like they belonged in someone else's life, were things that had no business being in this house:


A pink lace nurse outfit, sheer as hell. A pair of fluffy cat ears on a headband. Matching paw gloves. A tail with a little bell on it.


And scattered around them were a bunch of kinky little toys.


A wave of nausea and rage slammed into my throat.


Ryker Daven—the man I'd been married to for three years, the man who kissed me like it was a chore. The man who'd frown and say ""women should be modest"" whenever I tried to suggest anything remotely adventurous in bed. The man who treated sex like checking off a to-do list…


So when he was screwing her, he was into role-playing?


I’d always thought he was conservative, boring… maybe even a little frigid when it came to sex.


So I buried every curious impulse I had. I played the role of the perfect, demure wife he seemed to want.


Turns out I was the punchline.


He wasn't conservative. He just wasn't into me.


I grabbed that ridiculous bunny tail, my whole body shaking with rage, tears burning at the corners of my eyes.


""Babe, what are you looking for?""


Ryker's voice came from right behind me. I nearly jumped out of my skin.


I spun around and shoved the box deeper into the closet, blocking it with my body.


""Nothing—just… it's getting cold. Thought I'd grab you some warmer pajamas.""


He gave me a suspicious look but didn't push it.


Steam from the shower still clung to his flushed cheeks. He rubbed a towel through his hair, sat down on the bed, and casually set his phone on the nightstand.


That's when the screen lit up. A WhatsApp message popped up.


I glanced at it. My heart skipped.


The message read: ""What time tomorrow?""


Before I could say anything, Ryker noticed me looking.


He picked up his phone, smooth as ever. ""Oh, that's just a coworker. We're meeting up to visit a client tomorrow.""


His explanation came too fast. Like he'd rehearsed it a hundred times.


I looked away, pretending to fold clothes, but inside I was laughing bitterly.


If it was really a coworker planning a client visit, the message would've said ""What time are we leaving?"" or ""What time should we go?""


But ""What time tomorrow?"" with no context?


That ""tomorrow"" had a destination. A private one. A familiar one.


Like our apartment.


What they probably meant was: ""What time should I come over?""


I swallowed my rage. I was done with this marriage—that much was clear. But if I wanted to walk away with anything, I needed proof.


I turned back to him, forcing a soft smile. ""Sounds good. Get some rest.""


He hummed in response, already typing again, guard completely down.


I went back to the living room and sank into the couch, feeling like all the air had been sucked out of me.


That's when my phone buzzed.


A new friend request popped up on my screen. Someone from a group chat.


I remembered—it was from that murder mystery party we'd gone to with Ryker's coworkers a while back.


The message read:


""Hey Mila, it's Penny. Are you free to meet tomorrow? There's something I think you need to know.""


Chapter 3


The next morning at nine, I walked into the coffee shop with Liley by my side.


Three women from Ryker's department were already waiting. Penny was front and center.


We'd done a few murder mystery nights together before—I'd always liked them.


""Mila, I hope you don't mind us reaching out like this.""


Penny poured me a cup of coffee, her eyes full of pity and something close to guilt.


I shook my head. ""I appreciate it. Just tell me what's going on.""


She sighed and pulled out her phone, swiping to a photo.


In it, Ryker had his head pressed against some young woman's, both of them grinning like idiots.


""Her name's Layla Moreau. She works in the department next to ours. Mila… they're basically a public couple at the office.""


Another woman, Gabby, chimed in.


""Public?"" I felt like someone had just shoved a knife into my chest.


""Yeah,"" Penny said. ""Matching outfits. Couple's lunches. Every single afternoon, Ryker gets her coffee—like clockwork. Only her. It's so blatant, we couldn't stand watching it anymore.""


He gets her coffee. Every day.


Meanwhile, when I asked him to get me that ""first coffee of fall"" thing everyone was posting about, he told me not to act like some childish girl on the internet.


""Mila, you're a good person."" Cassie poured me some tea. ""Remember that murder mystery night when I got my period out of nowhere? You went to the mall next door and bought me pants. I would've been screwed without you.""


""You're too good for this. We couldn't just sit back and let you stay in the dark.""


All three of them looked at me like they had more to say.


Liley was clenching her fists beside me, looking ready to throw hands.


""Is there more? Just lay it all out."" I took a deep breath.


""Mila, brace yourself."" Penny opened Layla's Instagram profile.


My breath caught in my throat.


Her cover photo was a picture of her and Ryker kissing at some art gallery. The caption read: ""My dear husband.""


I scrolled down. Post after post of them playing happy couple.


The most recent one was from two days ago—the second day Ryker was supposedly at his boss's wedding.


In the photo, he and Layla were at some trendy restaurant, candlelit dinner spread out in front of them.


The caption: ""Celebrating our one-year anniversary.""


One year?


This betrayal had been going on for an entire year.


""Mila, look at this bag."" Gabby pointed to another photo. ""That's the latest Chanel Classic Flap. Over twenty grand. We checked—it's real.""


""And there's more. Designer bags, luxury brands—he's bought her a ton of stuff.""


My head was spinning.


Last month for my birthday, Ryker gave me the exact same bag. But he told me he got it from some ""replica dealer"" for two thousand bucks.


He'd even hugged me and said, ""Babe, real or fake doesn't matter—it's all about who's carrying it. We gotta save money, you know?""


I'd always thought being frugal was one of Ryker's good qualities. Sure, he didn't make much, but at least he knew how to save.


Turns out, he was just taking the money he saved on me and dumping it all on another woman.


""What about… the wedding?"" My voice came out hoarse. ""He told me it was a three-day thing?""


""The wedding was one day. That's it."" Penny crushed my last shred of hope. ""There was no three-day celebration. He took two days off and told everyone he was going on a trip with you.""


I gripped the cold teacup in my hands, feeling like a stripped-down clown standing under a spotlight.


""And nobody at work said anything?"" I bit down hard on my teeth.


""We tried,"" Gabby said helplessly. ""But Ryker told people your marriage was falling apart anyway. And Layla? She actually said the one who isn't loved is the real mistress.""


I let out a bitter laugh. Then I asked, ""Does she have a car?""


""Yeah, a white Tesla."" Penny answered immediately. ""Ryker paid the down payment, apparently. When she picked it up, Layla posted about it all over Instagram. Here—this one.""


She pulled up a photo. Layla was leaning against a brand-new white Tesla, holding a bouquet of flowers.


I stared at that license plate, burning the number into my brain.


I swallowed every emotion I had, looked up at the three of them, and asked one last question:


""I'm not letting that bastard get away with this. If I need evidence for the divorce, will you testify for me?""

I no longer own a smartphone. As many of you fellow dumbphone users are aware, there are an increasing number of services that can only be accessed via a smartphone app (event tickets, public transit, grocery discounts, ordering coffee, etc). 

I believe that public services should all offer an app-free alternative to access their services. I want to put pressure on organizations with app-only services and make the case that they are discrimating against the population that does not have smartphones. They are also pushing us to apps and screens when many people are trying to limit their screen time.   
  
On the other hand, there are many businesses that retain access to their services without an app. Uber, for example, still lets you call their number to book a ride. That's awesome, and we should celebrate them for doing that.

I am in the process of compiling a list of businesses and organizations that discriminate by requiring a smartphone app to access their services. And I'm also putting a list together of businesses like Uber that retain app-free access. I'm hoping to publish a list twice a year. The goal is to call out the big companies that are app-only and advocate that they offer an app-free alternative.

I need your help identifying app-only services, and also the companies we want to recognize for continuing to offer app-free access. I would appreciate all of your help to fill out the form on Offline Friendly that will help me build a list for the first report.

Here's the form for the ""Offenders"" for services that are app-only: [https://offlinefriendly.org/offenders/](https://offlinefriendly.org/offenders/)

Here's the form for ""Champions"" that offer app-free access to services:  
[https://offlinefriendly.org/champions/](https://offlinefriendly.org/champions/)

Part of all this work is to make sure we dumbphone users are able to function in society in the next five years without a smartphone. I don't want to live in a world where we need a smartphone to take public transit, access banking, buy groceries, etc.

Thanks a ton!

For me, it just felt like drinking a cup of coffee a little more alert, but none of the actual ADHD symptoms improved. It didn’t help with overwhelm, task initiation, or that “20 mental tabs open” feeling.

My doctor recently started me on Vyvanse, and I’m curious about other people’s experiences with it — especially if you switched after Ritalin didn’t do much for you.

I’m not looking for medical advice or dosage suggestions. I just want to hear how Vyvanse affected things like:
	•	overwhelm
	•	executive function
	•	task initiation
	•	being able to clean a messy apartment without shutting down after five minutes
	•	emotional steadiness / not bouncing from place to place

I’m doing all the supportive stuff (exercise, meditation, planners), but I’m still fighting my brain every day.

So for those who made the same med switch:
Did Vyvanse feel any different in terms of clarity, focus, or overwhelm?

A buddy of mine met his current partner through Reddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It’s definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I’ve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast, made my way through the Ozarks, and now I’m slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever’s on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it’s a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I’m more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I’m pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who’s curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn’t mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I’m drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don’t have to be a traveler (though that’s always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

1ozwtaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/1ozwtaz/take_2_i_posted_about_a_carbon_offset_idea/,[Take 2] I posted about a carbon offset idea earlier today and got roasted. Here's the actual concept—does this make more sense?,"Hi r/snowboaring,



I posted earlier today about a carbon offset idea and got roasted (deserved—I explained it terribly). The original post got deleted by the mods (fair). So let me try again with what I'm \***actually**\* looking to build, because I think I buried the lead:

\---

**The actual concept (pay-per-trip, not subscription):**

1. You drive from to the ski resort
2. Log your trip in the app (takes 5 seconds)
3. We purchase verified carbon removal credits for your trip
4. \*\*You pay: $6.50\*\*
5. \*\*You instantly unlock: QR code for free hot drink (or other F&B benefit) at the lodge (QR code valid today only, $6 value)\*\*
6. Net cost to you: $0.50 for fully verified, transparent carbon credits handled by us.

Repeat every time you go skiing (or hiking, camping, mountain biking, whatever).

\---

**Why this isn't the sketchy greenwashing BS you're thinking of (not my intent at all so please point out if this still feels this way):**

* **No afforestation schemes** (huge lack of trust in the market and deservedly so)
* Only AAA and AA-rated credits (verified by independent third parties like BeZero Carbon)
* **Focus on permanent carbon removals**:
   * Direct air capture (Climeworks, Carbon Engineering)
   * Enhanced rock weathering (UNDO)
   * Biochar (Puro.earth certified)
* **Full transparency on every trip:**
   * Every trip shows you which projects your money funded with registry certificate numbers you can verify yourself
* **You can verify everything:**
   * Every credit has a blockchain registry number
   * If you catch us buying fake/low-quality credits, I'll refund your entire year
   * We publish all purchases publicly (no hiding behind vague claims)

We're not hiding behind vague ""carbon neutral"" claims. You'll see exactly where your money goes.

\---

**The unit economics (since people asked last time) -** rough numbers for discussion purposes only\*\*:\*\*

* \*\*You pay:\*\* $6.50 to offset that roundtrip (100% of said CO2 would be offset and retired by us with a very small profit margin to keep the lights on)
* \*\*You get:\*\* $6 hot chocolate (example) + verified carbon removal for your 280km round trip from (example)
* \*\*Why partners give you free stuff:\*\*
   * They profit from incremental sales and foot traffic when you're there
* We bring them foot traffic - Everyone wins (this could expand to local businesses, not just the big corporation ski resorts that don't need more profits - skiing is expensive enough.

\---

**How this scales beyond skiing:**

Once/if we prove this works with ski hills, same model applies to:

* Coffee shops: ""Offset your commute, get 20% off""
* Breweries: ""Offset your drive, get free pint""
* Gas stations: ""Offset this tank, get free car wash""
* Any local business willing to subsidize rewards to drive foot traffic

\---

**Questions I actually need answered (brutal honesty please):**

1. **Value question:** Pay $6.50, get $6 back instantly + carbon removal—does that make sense or feel gimmicky?
2. **Behavior question**: Would you actually remember to log trips, or does this need to be 100% automatic (GPS-based)?
3. **Credibility question**: What would make you confident this isn't greenwashing? Registry certificate numbers you can verify? Third-party quality ratings (AAA/AA credits only)? Public audit reports? Something else?
4. **Psychology question:** Does linking the reward directly to the offset make you more likely to actually do it? Or would you just pay $2.50 for a $6 hot chocolate regardless of the carbon piece?
5. **Price reality check:** What's the max you'd pay per trip? - $5? $7? $10? - At what price does this stop making sense?
6. **The kill-criteria question:** Be brutally honest—if we dropped the carbon piece entirely and just said ""pay $5, get $6 at partner locations,"" would that be MORE appealing? Or is the verified carbon removal what makes this interesting?
7. **Usage question:** Would you only use this for skiing, or would you use it for other mountain/outdoor trips (hiking, camping, road trips)?

\---

**What I learned from my previous post**:

* People don't want subscriptions for things they use seasonally (fair point)
* ""We handle offsets behind the scenes"" sounds sketchy as hell
* The value prop needs to be instant and obvious, not ""maybe you'll use $15 worth of perks this month""
* Transparency isn't optional—you need to be able to verify everything or it's greenwashing which we are honestly not trying to do

So I rebuilt the whole model around those insights. Pay-per-trip, instant positive ROI, full transparency, rewards tied directly to behavior.

\---

\*\***I'm not trying to sell you anything—genuinely need to know:**\*\*

* Does this solve a problem you actually have? Not everyone has an EV or wants to take the bus (accessibility). It would be great to help the planet while simultaneously not drastically changing your lifestyle and getting a tangible reward for doing so.
* Does the instant reward make the carbon piece feel more real/tangible?
* What would make you go from ""interesting idea"" to ""I'd actually use this every trip""?
* Or is this still a solution looking for a problem?

If this is still stupid, tell me now so I can kill it or pivot before I waste more time. Thanks for the reality check earlier—it actually helped a lot. Thank you for your time!",0,1763424134.0,snowboarding,21,0.2,False

1ozws86,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ozws86,"I Was the Lie He Loved, Then the Truth He Lost","I'm a liar. And I fell for New York's golden boy.


To make him marry me, I faked everything.


Said I was a trust fund heiress who studied abroad. Built this whole fake life.


I actually believed if I played it right, I could fool him into loving me forever.


Then I heard him with his buddy:


""Dude, I actually feel bad for your liar wife.


She can't get pregnant, and yesterday your mom made her kneel in the snow!


But you got a vasectomy years ago...""


Hearing that, something crossed Ashford's face.


Almost looked like guilt. ""I promised Jade her son gets everything. So Elara can't have kids. That was always the deal.""


His friend laughed. ""You're still obsessed with Jade, huh?


""I mean, makes sense though. When Jade married your brother, your family treated her like trash. So you married Elara to take the heat off Jade instead.


""Elara has no idea you told your whole family she's a fake from day one...""


I froze on the spot.


Turns out, I'd been a joke all along.


Alright. From now on, I live for myself.


But after I left? Ashford went completely PSYCHO.


...


Inside the VIP room.


Ashford stared at his whiskey. Didn't say anything for a minute.


Finally, he spoke.


""Jade came from nothing. I needed someone disposable. A liar I could pretend to be crazy about. That way my mom would go after Elara instead of Jade.""


His buddy took a drink.


""Ash, real talk though. Elara might've lied to you, but that girl is head over heels. You can see it every time she looks at you.""


Ashford's jaw tightened.


""Everything I do is for Jade and the kid.


""As for Elara? That's just business.""


His friend smirked. ""If you love Jade so much, just divorce Elara and marry her. Your brother's been dead a year anyway.""


""I'm not divorcing Elara."" He said it fast.


""I'm sending Jade and Sawyer overseas. And when Sawyer's eighteen, he takes over everything.""


""Damn. You act like that kid's actually yours!""


Ashford finished his drink. His face went cold.


""I'm never having kids.


""Whatever Jade has—that's mine.""


Hearing that, everyone in the room started laughing and cheering him on.


I stood outside the door. Frozen.


So that's why.


Every time I went back to the Hayes estate, the entire family—even the staff—treated me like I didn't exist.


Only my mother-in-law would look at me.


But she just asked the same thing every time:


""Are you pregnant yet?""


And I would give her the same answer: No.


So winter after winter, I'd find myself kneeling in the snow.


Ashford would always rush back to save me. He'd frantically rub my frozen fingers, trying to warm them up.


And I'd just smile and nuzzle his jaw. ""I'm not cold. Really.""


Turns out, everyone knew I was a liar all along.


I looked down at the ultrasound report in my hand.


My fingers traced over the tiny dark spot on the paper.


Then slowly, I crumpled it into a ball and tossed it in the trash.


I want a divorce.


Chapter 2


When I booked the abortion appointment, the doctor wouldn't stop asking if I was absolutely sure.


See, my body's different.


If I terminate this pregnancy, I'll probably never get pregnant again.


I tried to answer, but the words got stuck in my throat.


Because the truth is—nobody's ever wanted me. Not really.


When my parents split, Mom took my perfect older sister—the one who knew how to play the game. Dad kept my brother—the one who could carry on the family name.


Grandma was the only one who hugged me tight and told me I mattered.


But then she died.


After that? I was just some forgotten weed growing in the middle of nowhere.


Until Ashford showed up.


He was the first guy who actually looked at me. Really looked.


All those times he picked me—stood by me—I let myself believe that maybe after the wedding, we could start a family.


A little person who was half me, half him.


I wanted to give that baby everything Grandma gave me, everything Ashford gave me. Pour all that love into one tiny soul.


But tonight I finally understood the truth.


He doesn't love me.


He's been playing me this whole time.


I stood there, gripping my phone, trying to figure out what to say to the doctor.


Then it buzzed.


A text.


From Jade—Ashford's sister-in-law.


\[Elara. We need to talk.\]


...


At the coffee shop.


Jade sat across from me, stirring her drink.


""So you're the one pushing Ashford to send me and Sawyer overseas?""


""That wasn't me.""


She laughed and slid a black card across the table.


""Leave him.


""Five million. More than enough for someone like you.""


I pushed it back.


""What, not enough?""


""I don't want money.""


""Okay then. WHAT do you want?"" She actually looked at me this time. ""You think you can take him from me?


""You have no idea how he used to be with me.


Back in college, he'd stand in line for two hours in the freezing cold just to get me coffee.


He'd keep it warm inside his jacket the whole way to my dorm.


I mentioned once that I liked ginkgo trees for my birthday.


Next morning? An entire street of them planted outside my apartment.""


She paused, her smile turning smug.


""But I married his brother anyway.


""The eldest Hayes wife had a better ring to it, you know?""


Her eyes lit up like she was reliving her favorite moment.


""On my wedding day, they said he stood outside the church all night. Got so sick after that he looked like a ghost.


""Now that his brother's dead, I guess everything's falling into place.""


I kept silence. My grip on the cup tightened until my knuckles hurt.


Jade's smile turned nasty.


""Since you won't walk away, let's make this interesting.""


She pulled out her phone. ""We both call him. Right now.


""I'll say our old dog is sick.


""You tell him you're running a 104 fever.


""He shows up for me? You sign the divorce papers.


""He shows up for you? I'm on a plane with Sawyer tomorrow.""


Her eyes dared me.


""What do you say?""


Chapter 3


A thousand thoughts raced through my head as I watched her sitting there, so sure she'd already won.


Then something inside me just snapped.


""Okay. Let's do it.""


Jade smiled. Waved her hand at me. ""You call first. If I go first and he picks up, he'll be halfway here already. Won't even see your call coming through.""


I pulled up his contact. My hands were shaking.


The phone rang. And rang. And rang.


Finally, someone answered.


""Mrs. Hayes?


""Mr. Hayes is in a board meeting. If you need something, I can help.""


Peter. His assistant.


I swallowed hard. ""I'm driving right now, but I think I'm getting a fever. Everything's spinning. Can you please tell Ashford—""


A pause on the other end.


Then:


""Mr. Hayes is closing a major acquisition deal today. He can't leave the room. I'll send a car to take you to urgent care right away.""


Click. He hung up.


I sat there staring at my phone, gripping it so tight my hand hurt.


Seeing that, Jade pulled out her phone, totally calm.


That smirk still on her face.


Her voice dropped to something soft and sweet. ""Hey Ash, I think Coal's sick.""


Then, his voice came through crystal clear. Fast. Urgent.


""Where are you?"" Then immediately: ""Peter, clear my schedule for the rest of the day.""


Jade glanced at me. Feigning concern, she continued.


""If you're busy, you could always just send—""


""I'm not busy.""


He cut her off gently. Then hung up.


At that moment, it felt like someone punched a hole straight through my chest.


Jade's smile got wider. She stared at me.


""You know what? Let's make this even better.


""You can thank me later\~""


Before I could react, she actually snatched my phone and started typing.


I reached for it, but my body wouldn't cooperate.


\[Ash, I was just in a car accident. I'm hurt really bad.\]


She sent it.


Time slowed down after that.


I watched that screen like my life depended on it. Nails digging into my palm.


Five minutes.


Ten.


The screen stayed black. Dead silent.


Jade pushed the card toward me again. ""Game over.""


I stared at that card and suddenly started laughing.


Then the tears came.


I really thought I was so smart. Such a good liar.


Turns out I was just pathetic.


""Yeah. You win.


""Keep your money.


""I'll sign the papers tonight.""


...


Outside the coffee shop, my phone suddenly rang.


Ashford.


I watched his name flashing on the screen.


And for the first time, my heart didn't race.


Declined. Blocked. Done.


Then I opened my email app.


Top of my inbox—the acceptance letter from Slade that came this morning.


The professor said my work showed real talent. Said he couldn't wait to meet me.


Funny thing is—


Two hours after I got that email, I found out I was pregnant.


That's why I freaked out and went looking for Ashford with the ultrasound printout.


I put my hand on my stomach.


Then wrote back:


\[See you in a week.\]

Here is the vicious cycle : you live a good sometimes hard life, something happens that breaks you, you suffer heavily, you seek non-duality as relief or as a coping mechanism, your life turns around, joy returns, better things happen, you forget non-duality and go on with your life, you wonder why you ever thought about this non-duality thing, time passes, suffering happens again

This path will never work as a coping mechanism, it might provide short-term relief but as you go deep, you will curse yourself for ever beginning, but there are some who are too far gone or who see through the impermanence of happiness and misery, pleasure and pain, you suffer again and again with intermittent pleasure to the point where you swear ""never again"" even to pleasure, even to happiness

Better you go listen to music or sing about love and such, travel somewhere if you want, you can go cry to someone or seek companionship, there is nothing to ""gain"" in this non-duality, in fact, you will lose everything, well you never had anything to begin with

Imagine being empty, just being like when you look mindlessly at a tree or the sky all the time, then meeting someone you love or a friend, only then by itself an ""I"" arises to talk and even when talking you see with absolute certainty the talking is happening by itself with no agent and the other person is not an ""other"", even if there is a joy arise of oneness, there is no one to enjoy it, the talk might be joyous but as soon as it ends, you forget it as if it never happened

There used to be romanticising of the suffering this mind went through before, all that recalling is because you enjoy this story, you enjoy suffering, it's hard to see through it, you always want to keep this ""me"" story running to not face the void

However even if you fall fully into the void, suffering will still happen, however what now? you don't care, suffering happens, you suffered 10 min? the next minute, its as if none of it happened because you no longer carry things with you or hold on to things

What? you think you will no longer suffer and be in bliss all the time? sorry, that's only in fantasy

You move like a wanderer, not knowing where you came from or where you're going and even when you do, you see without doubt that that deciding factor in your mind giving you the sense saying ""go here and do this"" and it happens by itself, there is no enjoying, no bliss, just presence that is conscious without being aware of ""things""

Now, that would scare you if you pursued non-duality just for relief or to avoid suffering, though it does put an end to suffering in the old way, meaning suffering happens, but it happens ""in"" you

Also You will never realise Awareness the way you think, you think you will see something or feel something and ultimately --> grab something that is permanent that will free you and ""own"" it

The Truth is ---> you give up everything until there is no ground left to stand on

Truth --> you stand on nothing, depend on nothing, seek no relief, stand naked in the void

But it is not unpleasent, it is forgetting yourself, in this mode, the body-mind functions extremely efficiently without waste, what needs to be done is done without thinking, even if it isn't done, there is no one to care

After a shoe is worn, it is then forgotten and you don't even feel it, like this, after conquering the thieves of emotions that seduce a person and when your mind stands undisturbed, its as if there are no things and its as if all these things are made of One essence or made of this ""Emptiness""

Why the title says that is because Abiding is not an easy thing, it requires a heart of steel, sometimes out of nothing comes an attachment to pleasure and you go into ego-mode, though it becomes rarer, when noticing happens, immediately it needs to end and return to the void, without any needless emotions

I am not saying this is a bad thing, not at all, but in the way our society is structured, this must be a nightmare, also when one knows the taste of black coffee, one can then add milk and sugar to it, it is essential to know this essence to be able to be at peace, otherwise one is disturbed

and my point of why the title, even knowing it is not enough, there is still residual habitual thoughts and reactions even with no one left to control but to whom does that matter?

My point is everyone believes Realisation is a ""special"" state, it is not, at all! It is impossible to never have experienced it, have you ever looked at the sky mindlessly, or after a long period of thought, you had a period of quietness, that is IT, it is extremely ordinary, it is because you expect and seek a special state that you do not realise it is already what you are, also you don't ""Realise"" it, you simply quieten/still the mind by focusing on the breath or any sense experience and then abandon ""wanting"" ""doing"" ""complaining"" or any action

I would say that this quietness feels nearly invincible because it doesn't try to win or resist fear, when an emotion comes, any emotion, fear, pity, sadness, despair, it is the resistance that creates the tension, it is the tension that gives it its weight, without the resistance, no emotion holds sway over

Also you see with certainty that you, others, universe appear in this empty presence however this certainty is only felt when you return to ego-mode and think about it, when let's say as you are immersed in this empty presence you try to ""see"" where thoughts or forms are, you find they are ungraspable as if just appearing without being able to hold them

7. Has a pet raccoon named Mayhem

8. He sees u/Fishy_fish6999 as a father figure

9. John can not hold any grudge against anyone. Teasing? Yeah, but he doesn't actively be hating on anyone. Except for a certain someone, or a company for that matters.... It's the reason why he's so quick to care for u/ar_26710 after she lost her memory despite she's the reason why he got sent to the infirmary

10. Whenever he senses something romantic is happening, he'll be there to stalk you... Spying on you and your partner... You are *not* safe... 

11. He has sixth sense, it's the reason why he wears his beanie the way he does despite not being able to see

12. The people he respects the most are as follow: Ryo and Asaru. And he's open to it too, he's not trying to hide it. 

13. He's envious to the people surrounding him, especially before he built M.T, where everyone around him are superhuman, or alien, or a Kamen Rider, he's just a normal guy, and he's pretty jealous of them because they got power, he thinks he's a nobody compared to them.

14. He is genuinely scared of Ayin, in fact he gets traumatised by him, but still, Ayin is one of the few people he is trying to befriend.

15. He tends to forget where his house is because he spends too much time karaoke to the point where he would accidentally sleep at the karaoke places

16. He's an orphan.

17. He implemented Babysitter Mode into M.T just incase he needs someone to watch over Mayhem but now... he's traumatized by it...

Wait do I need to go to what he thinks for others now? Cause I really wanna add some more but couldn't think of any, well I already talk about sum so why not. 

18. Avalon, he thinks Avalon is a pretty cool guy, he's very grateful for getting Ryo out of his depression phase a while ago

19. Nolan, he appreciates the help Nolan is giving him, with his training and all, but he thinks it's quite useless considering he now has a mech

20. Dr. Eterna, ~~WOWZIE THOSE LEGS~~ he thinks Eterna is a cool and respectable doctor the academy could have ever gotten, though sometimes he thinks she should LET HIM BRING MAYHEM INTO THE INFIRMARY!!!... Not like Mayhem will caused a mess, he's a very behaved raccoon!!

21. Yelling Soldier, a funny guy he wished to talk to more often, he kinda gets over to the face that Yelling Soldier literally steal stuffs, not like Yelling Soldier steal any of HIS stuff so he's fine with him.

22. Asara, one of his closest friends, he respect her highly and look up to her sometimes, he thinks she should leave TracenFall immediately,but that's for Asara to decide when.

23. Xenagoros, admittedly , everytime he sees Xenos he thought of X and how he wishes X is here again, but he also already gets over it, and now he just wants to talk to Xenos because he's a really great guy, he thinks they have something in common of both of them being a boyfailure.

24. Strykr, interesting guy...strong... He really wants to hang out with Strykr more.... Clearly, there's more than meet the eyes, but  he doesn't dwell on it too much.

25. Cafe, he thinks she's a close friend, he enjoys talking to her a lot, and is also a great source of COFFEE BEANS

26. Ryo, the greatest friend he could ever ask for, he's super glad how in times of doubt, Ryo always seems to believe in him, how Ryo always knows what to say on the spot, he highly respect Ryo.

27. Jaye, he loves the food that Jaye cooks, nice seafoods, but he really wanted to know and talk more to Jaye.

Anyway, that is all the fun facts for J.J.J.T.T. It's not so organised, I really just wrote this at 4 am. Credit to u/Look4The1WhoAsked, Strykr, and Omni Man for the inspiration, I couldn't remember all their username so like, this is that. ",6,1763422815.0,Umaddit,50,1.0,False

So I work at a family owned business and we got a new hire who I’ll call G who’s 17.

She is a bit of a nightmare. At first I just wrote things off but things have began piling up to the point where it’s really annoying.

For starters G’s a pathological liar, everything that comes out of her mouth is outlandish and ridiculous and a couple of my coworkers and my boss have caught her out on a few lies.

G also doesn’t do what she’s told or listen, she doesn’t do the jobs she’s needs to be doing when she is working and when she does do them you wonder why anyone with any common sense would of done that.
For a more recent eg we make little free cupcakes to give away with coffee’s and I asked her to box them up, what did she do? Pulverised all of them into a container, not even kidding looked like she cpr’d the shit out of them when my boss turned the container upside down they came out in a BLOCK.

She’s a pick me aswell if you’d call it that? She’s one of those girls who needs to talk about how petite and tiny she is in every conversation, esp if there’s a male coworker around like when she was chopping veggies and my male coworker was next to her she was ranting on about how big the knife was in her tiny hands and how she can barely cut the veggies bc the knife is so big, that sort of shit.

Not overall a massive deal but she also began stealing from my work when we’ve told her several times she needs to still pay for things.

She doesn’t show up for half of her shifts either, she’s only been here 3 weeks and has showed up to 4 shifts… so I’ve been having to fill in for her bc we’re already low on staff.

I’ve been pretty lenient on her and ignored a lot of it but I’m starting to think a lot of the shit she’s doing is intentional and idk how to call her out on it, bc a lot of her fuck ups are costing me aswell, her destroying merchandise means instead of making what I should be everyday I have to make extras of everything meaning I have to stay later bc I have extra jobs that need to be done, it’s getting a bit out of hand and frustrating and I’m a bit over it tbh but yep that’s my rant…",12,1763422411.0,coworkerstories,6,1.0,False

-She prefers appliances with a sleek design and something that doesn’t take up too much counter space

First time poster on the sub. Male. 29. I’ve been fasting since before the pandemic doing everything from OMAD, couple of 48hrs a week, and a few more extreme ones (for me) breaking at around 10 days in due to family obligations or holidays. I usually manage to keep the weight off. 

For reasons that I don’t want to get into rn my weight ballooned and I’ve been steadily lifting, running, doing 24 hr fasts and eating under maintenance when I do. I’m close(er) to my goal weight but I’m still 40lbs away from the date I set for myself to hit it. Usually I answer this kind of posts or questions on other sub with the same “there are no quick results” but I know myself and even when I made peace I won’t be reaching my goal in time I’m going to give it my absolute all for the next two weeks (I have 17 days left to a special someone’s birthday I promised to get in shape for, not to mention she’s throwing a big party I’d like to have a suit made for). 

I’m currently taking creatine, 5g a day, and I had my first meal of last week, last night. I’m working out heavy every day and running 3-5km every day. I do cheat with some sugar free drinks, and supplement with salts and plenty of water/tea/coffee. 

I know this isn’t the best approach but setting aside all the fasting benefits I usually tout, I need to maximize weight/fat loss. All in all, look thinner.

Any advice? I’m currently debating trying for my first extended fast for the next two weeks, or doing multiple two, three day fasts with one meal in between. I have a mentally and physically demanding job and that might help me work out more consistently but I’d be at a lower deficit.  Should I throw in a 0 carb protein shake every once in a while? Don’t fast but do a minimal >200kcal mostly fat snack to prime ketosis? Dropped alcohol entirely a few weeks ago, when I was having a drink on office outings on Fridays. 

Again, main and shallow goal is to look better. I’ll return to a healthier and more sustainable approach after this date. 

Tl;dr. Veteran to fasting, averaging multiple 3-5 day fasts a month. 15 days to deadline need to look my best, need to shed as close to the impossible 40lbs I still need to shave off.

# Nvidia Earnings Loom as Markets Brace for AI Sector Validation Amid Investor Caution

Markets entered a critical week with heightened anticipation surrounding Nvidia’s Wednesday earnings report, as the chipmaker’s results are viewed as a pivotal test for the sustainability of the AI boom. The company, which recently became the world’s first $5 trillion enterprise, faces intense scrutiny over its ability to deliver on CEO Jensen Huang’s forecast of a “half a trillion” dollar order book for its Blackwell and Rubin chip platforms.

Wall Street indexes fell sharply Monday, with the S&P 500 down nearly 1 percent and breaking a 50-day streak, as investors adopted a cautious stance ahead of the earnings announcement. Nvidia shares declined following news that Peter Thiel’s hedge fund Thiel Macro sold its entire 537,742-share stake during the third quarter, following similar moves by SoftBank. These high-profile exits have intensified concerns about potential AI sector overvaluation, though multiple analysts maintain bullish outlooks.

Alphabet shares jumped 5.5% to record highs Monday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a $4.93 billion stake in the Google parent company as of September 30. The investment marks a rare tech bet for Berkshire, which simultaneously reduced its Apple holdings during the third quarter. The stake represents Berkshire’s first position in Alphabet, coming two decades after Buffett reportedly inspired Google’s IPO structure. The timing of Berkshire’s investment has drawn attention from analysts, with Alphabet trading as the cheapest valuation among the Magnificent Seven tech stocks.

# Amazon Raises $15 Billion in Bond Offering While Expanding Auto Sales and Cloud Partnerships

Amazon returned to the U.S. bond market Monday with its first offering in three years, ultimately raising $15 billion across six tranches after attracting approximately $80 billion in demand. The six-part offering includes notes ranging from 3-year to 40-year maturities, with spreads from 30 to 85 basis points over Treasuries. Fitch assigned an AA- rating to the proposed notes. The proceeds will support general corporate purposes, including an estimated $100 billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, with roughly 70% earmarked for AWS expansion to support AI infrastructure.

In automotive partnerships, Ford announced it will sell certified pre-owned vehicles through Amazon’s platform in Los Angeles, Seattle, and Dallas, becoming the second major automaker to leverage Amazon’s e-commerce reach after Hyundai. The move pressured shares of Carvana and CarMax as traditional online auto retailers face new competition from the tech giant’s marketplace.

# Fed's Waller Backs December Rate Cut Citing Weak Labor Market and Rising Layoff Concerns

Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller advocated for a 25 basis point rate cut at the December 9-10 meeting, emphasizing that the weakening labor market warrants additional monetary policy support. Waller stated the labor market is near stall speed and deserves more attention than current inflation concerns, noting underlying inflation excluding tariffs remains close to the 2% target. The Fed governor highlighted rising reports of layoff plans in soft data and expressed concern that low job creation is predominantly demand driven. He characterized the December cut as providing additional insurance against accelerating labor market weakness, though acknowledged it would not immediately restore hiring to 150,000 jobs monthly. Waller also addressed the Fed's balance sheet, noting reserves are approaching scarce levels and predicting the balance sheet could begin growing again within one to two months. He suggested the FOMC may soon display the least groupthink in years, indicating potential for closer votes ahead. Waller declined to comment on whether President Trump's rate remarks are helpful for the Fed, maintaining focus on labor market conditions as the primary driver of his policy stance.

If you're into holiday decorating or just want to refresh your space with some festive vibes, you might enjoy this. I’ve been testing out a new feature inside [**Decor8.ai**](http://Decor8.ai) where you can literally *chat* with an AI and iteratively create unique Christmas decoration ideas.

Instead of scrolling endlessly for inspiration, you can describe ANY idea — cozy, classy, quirky, minimalist, maximalist — and the AI will help refine it step-by-step until it matches the exact holiday mood you're going for.

It feels like brainstorming with a designer who instantly visualizes your concepts.

You can say things like:

* “I want a warm and cozy Christmas living room with a Scandinavian vibe.”
* “Give me a modern, elegant holiday style with metallic accents.”
* “Help me decorate a small apartment without making it look cluttered.”
* “More playful… more color… less color… add lights… add texture…” … and it adjusts, iterates, and evolves your design with you.

If you want to try it, here’s the link:  
👉 [https://www.decor8.ai/christmas-decoration-ideas](https://www.decor8.ai/christmas-decoration-ideas)



# Copy These Detailed Prompts (Shown in the Video) and Try Them Yourself

These are some of the exact prompts used in the demo video — feel free to paste them directly into the AI and tweak them however you like:

# Prompt 1 — Christmas Tree Setup

**Insert a medium-to-tall Christmas tree placed in an empty corner or beside the focal wall. Decorate it with warm white LEDs, red/gold ornaments, ribbon garlands, and a star topper. Ensure the tree lighting casts a warm reflection consistent with the room’s lighting.**

# Prompt 2 — Mantle / Shelf / Media Wall Garland

**Add a lush green garland to the mantle, shelf, or media wall. Include soft warm micro-lights, pinecones, a few subtle red berries, and 2–3 stockings hanging evenly, matching the room’s color palette.**

# Prompt 3 — Holiday Scent Visual Cue

**Add a gentle holiday scent visual cue: place a small bowl of cinnamon sticks, dried oranges, and pinecones on the coffee table or sideboard, ensuring it blends naturally with the décor and enhances the warm Christmas vibe without cluttering the scene.**

# Prompt 4 — Warm Accent Lighting

**Add warm-toned accent lighting: place a couple of small table lamps or candle-style lights on side tables or shelves, ensuring they cast a soft golden glow that enhances the tree lights and makes the whole room feel richer and more festive.**

# Prompt 5 — Holiday Textiles

**Add a folded red or plaid throw blanket over the back or arm of each chair—keep it neat, not messy.**

# Prompt 6 — Chair Cushions

**Place one small holiday-themed cushion on each chair (snowflake, plaid, or subtle red/gold patterns).**

1ozvuqr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ozvuqr,Tried the Uproot Grooming Kit and Was Surprised at How Well It Worked,"Tried the [Uproot grooming vacuum kit ](https://technomeow.com/uproot-clean-pet-grooming-vacuum-kit-review/)this week and I’m honestly kinda surprised at how well it worked. I got it mainly because my long-haired cat sheds like it’s his full-time job, and brushing him normally turns my living room into a snowglobe of fur.

The first thing I noticed was the noise, or really, the lack of it. It’s not silent, but it’s way quieter than a normal vacuum. It has this low fan-like hum that didn’t send my cat running the way I expected. I kept it on the lowest setting at first just to see how he’d react.

The deshedding attachment is what impressed me the most. It grabbed a ton of loose fur really quickly, and since it’s attached to the vacuum hose, it just sucks everything in immediately. No floaty fur. No clumps on my clothes. No fur drifting into my coffee, which happens way too often.

I also tried the soft brush attachment, and that one feels more like a regular grooming brush but gentler. My cat actually leaned into it a few times, which shocked me because he’s usually super anxious about anything new. The suction didn’t pull or tug on his fur either, which was one of my worries.

The kit comes with a bunch of other tools like a trimmer, a nozzle for cleaning up, and a dematting tool, but I’ve only tested a couple so far. The dustbin is a decent size too. I filled it halfway just from one grooming session, which says more about my cat than the machine lol.

For anyone wondering how it works with anxious or noise-sensitive cats, going slow really helps. I let him sniff the attachments before turning anything on, kept the vacuum part a little farther away, and used treats as a distraction. By the second session, he wasn’t even flinching.

Not saying it magically solves everything, but it definitely made grooming easier and way less messy. If you’ve got a nervous long-hair, this might be worth trying. Just be patient the first couple of times.",1,1763421691.0,technomeowcom,0,1.0,False

1ozvt5u,https://youtube.com/shorts/bRfPtg6CAYE?si=i2AcAuRW8FQAAZx5,Apple a Day? Nah Apple Cake Slay.,"Anyone else get that *must‑snack* urge with their afternoon coffee (or tea)? For me, that 5pm cup when I finally get home just feels incomplete without something sweet on the side. And now that it’s fall, the craving hits even harder—like, cozy season demands cake.  


This recipe is super simple (promise, no fancy skills required) but still really tasty. I know there are a million ways to bake a cake, but this one’s been a hit with my friends and coworkers, so I figured I’d share it here.

Give it a shot if you’re into easy bakes, and let me know what you think. Also curious—what’s your go‑to cake when the snack cravings hit?

**Ingredients:**   
\- Flour  
\- Sugar  
\- Cinnamon  
\- Apple  
\- Yogurt/Sour Cream  
\- Eggs  
\- Vanilla  
\- Baking Powder  
\- Baking Soda  
\- Salt  
\- Vegetable Oil 

**Recipe:**  
Throw 4 eggs + 1 tsp vanilla in a bowl and beat the heck out of them for 3–4 minutes till fluffy, add 1 cup sugar and keep beating another 2–3 minutes, dump in the 1 cup yogurt (or yogurt + sour cream combo) and mix about a minute, pour in 1 cup oil and mix again, toss in ½ tsp salt + ½ tsp baking soda + 2 tsp baking powder, then get to the flour—pro tip: never scoop straight from the bag because it’s compacted, fluff it first, spoon lightly into the cup, level it off, and for the love of cake SIFT IT. Start adding flour gradually (2 cups to begin, then more while mixing on low until you’ve got normal cake batter thickness, usually lands around 3–3.5 cups total). Chop 2 small yellow apples into tiny pieces (skin on, lazy win), drown them in a ridiculous amount of cinnamon until they’re basically brown, spray/grease your pan, pour in half the batter, dump the cinnamon apples in the middle, cover with the rest of the batter, and bake at 350°F (170–180°C) for 55 min to 1 hour—start checking at 55 with a toothpick and leave it a little longer if you want that extra golden top.

Anyway background 

I am a Muslim man but I am a European Muslim yes that’s a thing since ottoman times. 

I went to school for comparative religion. 

I wear a traditional Islamic prayer cap most days. 

Anyway I am at my local coffee cafe drinking my coffee at the time I was actually reading a book specifically on Islam and Europe “Traveling home” by Sheik Tim Winter (Abdul Hakim Murad) he teaches at Oxford. 

Anyway this boomer guy comes over I was already in a conversation with his friend an older women very nice person so he joins after he of course tripped over my dress shoes and scuffed them but no an issue I was like hey don’t sweat it it’s just a thing. 

Anyway we get back to discussing he starts to say a few things unprompted about black people immigrants and Muslims I disagree on his ignorant takes but then he starts saying things factually incorrect about my religion I correct him because this was something pretty fundamental like a “the sky is blue moment” anyway he started blustering and being panicky screeched about how Jesus is coming back and I’m going to hell I shake his hand tell him I hope he has a good day and it was a pleasure to meet him he waddles muttering “he has to get out of here”. His friend looks mortified and makes an excuse to leave as well.  I finish my drink and my book. 

The next day I’m back at the same spot his friend apologized to me on his behalf. I say you didn’t do anything wrong but you need better friends. 

Told some of my friends about it and they say I handled it well but others say I have the right to be upset. I’m not very upset it’s not like anyone was hurt.

I’m just mostly wondering am I doing too much. 

When I hookup with someone, I select very selective. I make sure they’re some I would like sexually and could see myself in a relationship with. 

When we meet, 
-We kiss or hug at the door (depends on vibe and/or chat previously) 
- We then talk for maybe 20-40 minutes
- I like to slowly ease into it
- We start to lightly kiss then full out kissing. 
- We kiss for a while and grab each other where you would grab one. 
- Then I usually go back to talking 
- Then kissing more passionately 
- After that we might do sum 


I feel like whenever everyone describes hookups to me it just like a flash of KISSING from the get-go BED, PANTS OFF and time for business. It’s not even some people describe it to me like I’ve only heard it this way. Usually afterwards people want to meet up afterwards for a coffee and stuff.

Im 25, finished grad school this summer after delays because I was letting my anxiety get in the way. But I only graduated a ""semester late”. I’m trying to not put myself to strict deadlines but I am also trying to hold myself accountable. I feel stuck in this place. I’m living home while i figure things out career wise. My current circumstances make me feel alone, I don’t have friends. I have one person I talk to but we don’t hang out much, my siblings are in college for their undergrad. I just feel like I can’t relate to anyone. I opened up to my grandma or mom but we don’t have that relationship and they emphasize dating (never dated) 


So I have this friend I knew from childhood. We went to high school together. She moved away then came back for college. In college we were close and had the same major/ a lot of the same classes (small college) we were always together. Same interests. At some point she got new friends and I got hurt that the friendship was one sided. We didn’t ever really communicate and I assumed the friendship was dead. We didn’t speak again. It was painful to watch her posts online so I removed her. We came back in touch through being at the grad school orientation, we got coffee. But I never saw her after. Social media just disappeared. 

Years later she got engaged and moved. But she’s back now, my mom apparently saw her mom. They kinda talk together. My mom said it won’t hurt to reach out. I think my mom sees I’m alone or look lost, once my mom just said: you used to be so lively what’s going on. You hardly talk to people.


Im just scared trying to resuscitate a friendship when im in a place of not having my own friends and still figuring my career out. Feeling like im so behind/ others are well adjusted… it may not be good. What do you think? My confidence is shot because im applying to jobs and no luck plus questioning my college choices.

For Christain, red velvet cake is an easy one, along with old books like you'd find in a library, blue winter roses, and lastly the smell of a snow covered forest that kinda burns your lungs with the cold.

With Robin, he would smell fresh Mangos, the burning wood of a campfire, a mossy forest after a rainy day, and a popular brand of metal polish used by other students for their weapons, especially swords.

As for Olga, freshly brewed tea, the overwhelming sweet smell of a candy shop, the smell you get when you walk into a bakery, and the smell of hot chocolate.

Finally with Mouse, definitely the cold ocean breeze, the bitter smell of Atlesian black coffee, the fruity and sweet smell of cheesecake drizzled in fruit puree, and also fresh laundry.

Sennheiser G4, G2, and two cheaper Audio2000s systems through an RF Venue combiner with omni Sennheiser paddle antenna. 

But there are a couple of places that are an absolute nightmare for RF. One is a bar where we set up by some electronic dart boards, an ATM, and an AV rack for their TVs, though I'm not really sure what devices are causing the interference. We shut off the dart boards to test but no luck, and we can't turn off anything else. It's intermittent noise, so the scan feature thinks every channel is clear. After trying everything I could think of to switch channels, move the antenna, move the rack etc, I just abandoned all wireless and had everyone use wired beltpacks. It sucked and it erodes my bandmates' faith in me as sound guy. Note that when we sometimes play outside of this bar we have no issues, so it's definitely interference localized inside the bar. 

Well, recently we went to a larger city near an industrial part of town. Cool little multi purpose venue with a coffee shop built in. I scanned with the G4 receiver... best group has three open channels. And they are NOT clean. I take the best one available and make it work. We loan the wireless mic to an auctioneer and as soon as you get 10 ft from the receiver, it's cutting out like crazy.

1ozvgub,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1ozvgub/when_your_abuser_dies/,When your abuser dies,"I'm not sure this qualifies as NSFW, but parts are graphic so I feel like I should include a trigger warning. I don't want to upset anyone. 

Two weeks ago my ex-husband and father of my 12 yr old son died from hemorraghic shock caused by a massive GI bleed that was a result of end-stage cirrhosis. He was 48 yrs old and the most severe alcoholic/addict I have ever seen or known in my life. 

When his mother and I went to his apartment after his death, it was blood-soaked and blood-splattered, littered with countless empty cans of premade margarita and long island iced tea. The carpet on his living room floor was a pool of bright red blood next to a smaller pool of deep red, viscous blood that had what looked like coffee grinds in it. Next to that was his pillow and a large plastic container of blood vomit. Blood was splattered all over the bathroom. 

He had managed to call 911. Before losing consciousness at the hospital he asked for me to be the one to make medical decisions on his behalf and referred to me as his wife. Those were his last words. We divorced 10 yrs ago. He was given 16 blood transfusions, six plasma transfusions, and five variceal bands but it was too late. He was placed on life support due to organ failure. I gave the DNR order. I waited to take him off life support/transition him to comfort care so his mom could fly out and be with him, which she was able to. He passed on his own hours later. 

During our marriage he was violently abusive when drunk. It took a long time for me to understand that the alcohol wasn't causing the abuse, but in the four years we were together I ended up with multiple broken bones and a partly crushed esophagus from a chokehold. He threatened to murder me multiple times and would verbally violently rage at me for hours about what a disgusting piece of shit I am, among other things. I was deeply in love with him at one point and while that ended, my memory of it hasn't. His abuse still shocks me and continues to be emotionally crippling in various ways. 

He was funny, intelligent, articulate, talented (he was a bass player), likable, jovial (when sober), interesting. He was good to our son and good to my kids from my first marriage. We knew each other very well. Even after our divorce we knew what the other was thinking or feeling just from a glance. It was an uncanny connection that I've never really had with anyone else. It was also one that he exploited.

Those good/close aspects mixed with the abuse led to a trauma bond that took years to dismantle. Next to my father, who died last year, this was the most complicated and damaging relationship of my life. 

This grief feels extremely confusing. One moment I'm feeling guilt for not doing more to help him even though I did everything I could think of over the years aside from letting him sink me too. But the guilt is there. Then I'm remembering happy moments of laughter and sharing. Our son's birth. Then he's ripping my hand apart to yank away the glass of alcohol he wasn't supposed to be drinking. Then I'm seeing his blood and watching him die. 

Our son doesn't know the details but he is barely speaking. He says he's ""fine."" He's been withdrawn and nearly monosyllabic with any adult for six months. I had thought maybe it was hormones, but now I'm understanding that he was watching his father die the 3-4 days/nights a month they were together. His dad had been very involved in his life until the cirrhosis diagnosis two years ago. Only his older brother and sister from my first marriage seem to be able to get him to talk right now, but he won't speak of his dad. 

This feels unbearable. I've reached out to a few support groups but I don't know where to go. Alanon? Grief support? Trauma/abuse support? I don't know how to grieve this. I'm realizing I've never really grieved anything in a way that could be described as healthy. But because of my son I know I need to handle this differently and not just escape into the myriad maladaptive avoidant coping habits that I've used all my life to numb pain. I have a therapy appointment tomorrow and plan to look into therapy and any kind of support group that might be of help (alateen?) for my son as well. 

My ex's parents and most of his friends (who either live far away or were made in recent years) don't know how abusive he was so this feels incredibly lonely. Everyone on my end knows what happened and while they support me, there's no way they can really understand what this feels like. It's a nauseating amalgamation of love destroyed by addiction and abuse, shattered trust, broken bones, pity, sorrow, guilt, confusion, worry and fear for my son, and tragedy that will continue to reverberate throughout our family for the rest of our lives. 

Anyway, thank you for reading. I am open to any suggestions on how to deal with this. ",2,1763420747.0,GriefSupport,0,0.75,False

1ozvgkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PositiveTI/comments/1ozvgkv/the_health_bomb/,the health bomb,"Hey PPL, I've posted this in another sub some days ago, didn't post it here, yet, so decided to give it a go again...  
  
Okay you're targeted, constant stress, mental terror at check. Do you also have your health in check? If you have a good health, your mind will become much more stable. You have more energy, are emotionally calmer, have higher mental facilities, are more wide awake and aware, need less sleep, have more positive and resistant mind states, no matter if you think you're ground down with mental terror or with external hardship, if you are healthy your chances to keep level will rise exceedingly. Good health, can make a difference between sleepwalking and being wide awake. So contemplate how well you can keep your body, and if keeping it better may rise your chances.

I smirked when I read the TISolutions thread with the lots of encouragement to eat healthy and do good for the bowels. Yeah, that's right, the fries, burgers and buritos will drain you my friend. See a person with unhealthy skin, lots of diseases, weak immune system? Probably bad nutrition. It could be fixed with healthy eating.

Now the bowels thing. The pinned post made me want to pick it up somehow... Yes, in the bowels is big ecosystem of germs and fungi. However it's composed, it will affect how and what enzymes and other substances from food will be available...with by products, and this can also change whole brain chemistry.

After realizing I was attacked again some years ago with constant mental terror illusions. I decided to give myself all the health boosts I could to keep resisting and keeping up my life. I started meditation, but most importantly I cut all that was draining me and got me down. I cut alcohol, nicotine, bad pharmaceutics (using meds only when it makes sense, but then freely, using widely accepted herbal remedies by preference). I cut bad entertainment that reinforces negative patterns (reality is much better to learn from, entertainment should uplift in a positive way), I started thinking about religion and the meaning of life, I stopped all porn use, I stopped mindless media distractions, rather learning and researching things than sit in front of TV. I stopped drinking lots of coffee, and later started using green tea instead. All illicit drug use, again I tell you, I decided to never again touch drugs from unknown sources, never again any black market substances. I got poisoned before multiple times, had to learn the hard way. Started doing phases of regular workout, building up all kinds of healthy activities, started engaging with people no matter how much the pressure in my head hurt, whenever I was ready to cope with it even at all. It were such hard years, but it was worth it so far, I don't look back but every little effort was worth it and helped saving my life.

Okay, and food. I really have a weird relationship to this, I always thought it was not so important. Then I started first vegetarism, then veganism. I made sure to do it right, eating craploads of veggies, legumes, grains every day, making sure plant protein is added in masses and B12 folate from pills every day. It is like a constant light fasting, and it make me feel more awake and revealed more of the mental influence immediately. This experience was years ago, and it made me realize that eating really changes that much. Just eating more vegetables, will make a big difference, all kinds of anti-oxidants and other substances in them constantly battle negative influences for the whole system in the blood stream.

The next revelation came to me when I just fasted for a week, with some preparation days of light food, then only (liquid) vegetable juice and a cup of salted broth every day for a week. Haha, it really restored my bowels as advertized, and I did to finally cut out all treats fatty foods and crisps out of my life. The change was immediate, even in the days with light food I already felt the difference - like a black cover lifted from my head making me more awake and aware. Each time such a thing happens, all the mental voices, abuse, visions etc. all fade, only what's positive stays, and I can feel a part of myself waking up and being with me all the time, which was missing before. The torment visions - just toned down, later adapted, but since that fasting the effect stayed until today. I immediately planned to regularly do that. Part of the effect, was for sure the system in my bowels being restored - I deliberately drank lots of tea and also probiotic substances with lactobacillus and yeast during this time. Such germs clear out all bad opponents in there permanently. Just if you continue to eat unhealthily, they might come back at some point and you slowly lose the effect, feeling drained again.

Okey enough of that bowel shit, just eat more veggies and less crap and treats, fast a time or two in a healthy way and you will see. The mindfunk I had - suddenly I woke up being aware of it again, and many programs started failing out on me.

If you're impatient, try to get a kicks out of this smoothie recipe I have for a quick fix. It's like a bang for the bucks recipe, and even tastes half decent. This also literally kicks through the trauma cloak and lets you feel yourself again - this helps breaking trauma intrusion based mind control, stuff just doesn't impress you any longer when you feel awake. It's rather cheap to get all ingredients in every store where I live, I drink one every morning, the second is for my wife or later. Do this, meditate, and I'll see you again. See health warnings at end before trying, some people have allergy or liver conditions and need to take care/replace ingredients.

The ""good morning grenade"" aka ""horseshoe handout""

for 700ml \~ 2 portions

* 100g apple
* 100g banana
* 75g celery stalks or another veggie like broccoli or summer squash
* 15g green celery green or green spinach, salad leaves or other edible green leaf
* 10-15g linen seed
* 1-2cm fresh peeled ginger (or 1/2 tsp ginger powder)
* 1-2cm fresh peeled turmeric (or 1/2 tsp turmeric powder)
* 1/4-3/4 tsp green tea (matcha) powder (optional)
* 100ml lemon juice
* 2-3 Tbsp (20-40g) hemp protein powder or other plant protein powder (optional, makes a thick drink)
* 1 pinch of salt (electrolytes)
* 1/4 tsp cinneamon
* 2 pinches cardamon
* 1 pinch ground cloves
* 1 tsp - 1 tbsp maple syrup or other sweetener (if you need quick energy)
* 2 fresh mint leaves (optional, for a little fresher taste)
* 1/4 tsp ground black pepper, a pinch of Chili powder or a squint tabasco (for activating the turmeric)
* fill the blender up with clean water (should be around 200-300ml)
* you can also add the flesh of a passion fruit, to make it taste much better and get some extra vitamins

Chop it all & put it into a blender and blend finely, then you can drink 2 portions of it. Yeah it looks like snot and the taste reminds vaguely of horse (hence the name) with more exotic fruits than it is containing, but it's actually pretty good I think and I actually enjoy the taste with some sweeteners. I didn't calculate the calories yet - the effect however is strong. It is not really a drug, but just cheap healthy things combined, it works massively anti-inflammatory and anti-depressant (celery, ginger, turmeric) with anti-oxidants (green tea, apple, salad, green tea), preventing thrombosis (ginger), giving nutrition and vitamins and potassium (lemon juice, apple, banana), a mild stimulant (green tea), and bowel-restoring and protecting substances (greens, linen seed, and all fibers contained). The rest is just for the taste. You could add even more substances, but this one is already magnificient. You may see, if you do it for the first time and you're used to feeling rather sick, it may even feel uncomfortable, like too much life coming back to you from this. I believe it's way more potent (and healthy) than coffee to get you wide awake, and it works much more reliably and enduringly. It's real weird, not like a drug, but it just hypes you up and makes you feel present all time in a natural way, and makes you feel as if your body is soft and pleasantly glowing due to turmeric & ginger having good synergy.

The health warnings: it's all just standard food ingredients from groceries...but celery can cause allergy for some, make sure you're not affected, leave away. Ginger works like aspirine slightly diluting the blood - make sure you've no condition which makes this dangerous. The turmeric may impact the liver if given daily in high doses or with precondition - leave away or dose low if your condition demands. Green tea contains caffeine, you can leave it away and use other antioxidant powders like moringa or barley grass. Try not to ingest more raw linen seed per day than the 15g, and take care if your digestion allows these seeds - if you take more than that in raw state, the hydrocianic acid can build up, but it's only traces afaik. If you're on certain prescription meds, it may be necessary to take care because of turmeric, ginger, tea and celery possibly affecting the metabolism, leading to higher or lower blood levels of medications. Check this out. Also remember to make pause now and then with turmeric and/or celery and swap for other similar herbs during the time, it keeps the whole thing effective.

Like I say I keep the ingredients cheap, and I try to also ingest other things with similar properties throughout the day. The bananas and celery I buy when in discount, peel and chop and freeze the bits in bags, to get my fill every day & have the smoothie nice cold to drink right away. Lemon juice in bottles, the green tea powder can be the cheapest but take care there's no greater heavy metal or aluminium traces in it if you do it daily.

Okay enough for today. Hope this helps somebody getting bad stuff out of their system and wake up again. Don't give it up, just keep swimming until you rise above water level. Persons with heart and integrity, are like signal buoy for society. They are supposed to swim in front of others so all know what's safe and where danger starts. You can push them down with weight as much as you want. As soon as they are freed, they will shoot back up to the surface. Free yourself from all unhealthy crap, and one day you can maybe also be like that. Don't worry if it takes time, take your time - change your life step by step, one project after the other. Each project you fail, work it out, research it thoroughly, record your personal reasons to remember when it counts. Keep trying again each time you fail as long as you're sure a thing's worth it. After time, the changes can sum up and make you propel back to life. I've done this being deep down and constantly tyrranized in my mind.

1ozve84,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaEhzcDDt1w,Flynn Tells Trump to Flee Ukraine Debacle - Venezuela Attack Ends Maga - Is Trumps Goose Cooked? | Garland Nixon,"From Kimi K2

-----

**Introduction and Trump's Epstein Leverage Crisis**

Garland Nixon opens his broadcast from St. Petersburg, Russia, where he's concluding an extensive research trip across Russia and Belarus, and immediately addresses Trump's mounting political peril. He frames the Epstein scandal not as a matter of moral judgment but as a calculated leverage operation orchestrated by what he terms ""Zionist"" interests. According to Nixon, Epstein functioned as a hub for illicit activities—gun running, financial crimes, technology transfer—but his primary purpose was creating compromising material on powerful figures through videotaped encounters. The current strategic leaking of Trump's Epstein connections represents the deployment of this accumulated leverage. Nixon argues the selectively targeted nature of these leaks proves the operation's true purpose: while Trump's Epstein ties dominate headlines, other powerful figures like Bill Clinton (who flew on Epstein's plane) and Mohammed bin Salman (mentioned in Epstein's records) face no similar exposure. This asymmetry, he contends, demonstrates that the Epstein network was designed precisely for moments like this—to coerce leaders into compliance when they need to be ""twisted up"" to pursue specific foreign policy objectives.

**Venezuela as Coercion Target and Strategic Distraction**

Nixon connects this leverage operation directly to the escalating Venezuela situation, where Trump has positioned significant military assets off the coast and threatened intervention. He reveals that Karina Machado, the U.S.-backed opposition figure, has explicitly promised to be ""the most pro-Zionist, pro-Israel person ever"" if installed, suggesting Israeli strategic interests are driving the Venezuela pressure campaign. The goal, he theorizes, is to transform Venezuela into a regional military platform for South American dominance. This interpretation explains why the Epstein files are being weaponized now: to force Trump's compliance with a war his base overwhelmingly opposes. Nixon emphasizes that only 29% of Americans support attacking Venezuela, creating a severe political risk for Trump, who was elected on an explicit ""America First"" anti-interventionist platform. He meticulously dismantles the official justification—combating drug trafficking—pointing out that Venezuela isn't a primary cocaine source, destroying it wouldn't stop drug flows, and enterprising traffickers would simply reroute through other countries. The real motivation, he argues, is classic resource theft and geopolitical positioning disguised as humanitarian or security concerns.

**The Broken Promise of America First**

The core of Nixon's analysis focuses on Trump's betrayal of his MAGA coalition. He explains that many Trump voters weren't traditional Republicans but desperate Americans seeking an end to endless wars—libertarians, anti-establishment progressives, even disaffected black voters who despised Trump but saw Kamala Harris as worse. These voters specifically rejected foreign entanglements in favor of domestic investment. Trump explicitly promised to end wars and ""get rid of the neocons and warmongers."" Yet within ten months, he attacked Yemen (which Nixon dismisses as a choreographed ""dance"" with Iran where both sides fired weapons harmlessly), threatened Venezuela, and now attacks anti-war Republicans like Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene while campaigning for neocon Lindsey Graham. Nixon predicts this betrayal will fracture MAGA, causing it to revert to its Tea Party roots and potentially triggering Republican midterm losses as the base stays home. He contrasts this with Democratic liberals who, despite claiming to champion indigenous peoples and minorities, vocally support attacking Venezuela's ""indigenous people of color"" while ignoring actual indigenous oppression when it serves imperial interests.

**Ukraine's Irreversible Collapse**

Turning to Ukraine, Nixon delivers a stark assessment using vivid analogies: Ukraine is like a boxer ""out on his feet"" after a palm strike to the nose, arms dropped, destined to fall; or a chess player in zugzwang who realizes every available move leads to defeat. He argues this outcome was always inevitable, referencing Russia's historical pattern of defeating invaders from Napoleon to Hitler. The deteriorating situation has reached a point where corruption investigations are being weaponized—not to stop theft, but to manage the narrative as the money dries up. Nixon exposes what he calls the ""ATM shift"": while Ukrainian officials steal millions, Western politicians and corporate interests (he names Stoltenberg, Kallas, Macron, Starmer, BlackRock) steal five times as much. The $200-300 billion funneled to Ukraine has disappeared into a web of overpriced equipment, inflated contracts, and kickbacks. A tank worth $50 million gets purchased for $70 million with everyone along the chain taking cuts. Now that the Russian military is systematically dismantling Ukrainian forces and taking town after town, the grifters are scrambling to cover their tracks by scapegoating Ukrainian officials while positioning themselves as anti-corruption crusaders—""arsonists pretending to be firemen.""

**The Endgame and Systemic Failure**

Nixon connects these threads to argue the entire neoliberal system is destabilizing. He notes Michael Flynn's recent statement that the war is lost, interpreting this as an establishment figure reading the writing on the wall. The collapse isn't happening as fast as some claim nor as slowly as others insist, but it is accelerating. Russian forces are capturing villages daily, with Telegram videos showing Russian flags planted in newly taken towns. The Russian strategy has evolved beyond military victory to societal punishment—systematically destroying Ukraine's electrical grid to ensure a ""cold, dark winter"" as retribution for terrorist attacks on Russian civilians. Nixon justifies this escalation by listing Ukrainian atrocities: bombing civilian trains, attacking a music festival, and terror operations in Kursk. He concludes that the West's Ukraine project has become an existential liability, and the attempts to pivot to Venezuela represent a desperate search for a ""win"" to offset the inevitable defeat.

**Personal Anecdotes from Russia**

Interwoven with the geopolitical analysis are personal reflections from Nixon's Russia trip. He describes freezing on a Moscow train platform at 6:55 AM in 30°F weather, contemplating death by hypothermia, before discovering that deep knee bends and arm exercises could warm him by stimulating blood flow in the body's largest muscles. He uses this as a metaphor for Russian resilience and practicality. Later, he praises St. Petersburg's vibrant Saturday nightlife despite snow and cold, noting packed bars, coffee shops, and streets full of young people—contradicting Western media narratives of a collapsing Russia. He emphasizes meeting ""salt of the earth"" people who embody normalcy and hospitality, reinforcing his view that sanctions have failed to break Russian society.

**Final Assessment and Call to Action**

Nixon concludes by urging viewers to recognize the entire political system is fraudulent. He expresses hope that young candidates might challenge establishment dinosaurs in primaries, though he remains deeply skeptical of voting machines and electoral integrity. His final message is both analytical and personal: the Ukraine debacle proves the imperial model is failing, the Epstein revelations prove elite manipulation is real, and Trump's Venezuela threats prove campaign promises are disposable. He makes a direct funding appeal, listing his Patreon, Buy Me a Coffee, PayPal, and PO Box, emphasizing that viewer support enables his independent journalism. The broadcast ends with a characteristic mix of geopolitical doom-saying, systemic critique, and grassroots solidarity, framed through the lens of his on-the-ground observations from Russia.",5,1763420568.0,WayOfTheBern,3,0.73,False

We'd begin and end runs at trail heads, not breweries or pubs. Our goals would be to run, maintain fitness, encourage one another, build camaraderie, and share our favorite mountain trails. 

My go-tos are in and around Straton OS, Section 16, Captain Jacks, Cheyenne Mnt and Mueller State Parks. 

Since a stranger is just a friend you haven't met yet....I'm a 50-year-old male who averages 12–15-minute miles, depending on terrain and elevation gain. I run between 5-15 miles per outing. I prefer a zero-proof vibe in contrast to many of the run clubs with brewery and pub connections. 

If you're of a similar mind and ability, let's meet for coffee and plan some mid-day trail runs!",4,1763420476.0,ColoradoSprings,0,1.0,False

It’s driving me bonkers. I’ve quit twice in November. Lasted for two days both times but it’s far more than I thought I could achieve..,"I have always thought it’s easier to just keep smoking rather than thinking about NOT smoking every minute every day. I am 57f. Been smoking since age 14 when 21 year old friends dared me to smoke. Then dared me again to actually inhale. Within days I was hooked and searching ashtrays around the house for butts. I stopped smoke breaks at work around 2020. This year I stopped morning coffee and cigarettes because I realized the morning cigarettes brought back the chest soreness from chain smoking the night before. I like not having chest discomfort and jitters all day. Evenings do me in. Smoking is my activity. Passes the time. I go outside on my balcony. I journal while smoking. Then switch it up by playing games on my phone while smoking. I quit this past Saturday night. Did not smoke Sunday. Come Monday morning, I feel depressed. All day at work the internal war in my brain was I don’t smoke/im getting a pack after work today. Which I did. How do you deal with the insanity going on in your head?",3,1763420434.0,quittingsmoking,4,1.0,False
