I’ve always been the kind of person who pushes hard — for promotions, for goals, for growth. I thrive on challenge. Two years ago, I was chasing my fourth promotion in just three years. My days were long, packed with back-to-back meetings and tight deadlines. After work, I’d usually hit the gym to reset — until stress caught up with me.

The pressure piled on. I started skipping workouts. I’d crash at night, craving something savory and satisfying. Chips became my nightly ritual. Not the healthy kind — the real, salty, crispy, guilty-pleasure kind. I told myself it was a small indulgence, a reward for grinding so hard. But over time, that “small indulgence” added up — I got the promotion, sure. But I also gained twenty pounds, felt sluggish, and started feeling like I’d lost part of myself.

That was my wake-up call. I tried switching to healthier snacks, but let’s be real — most “healthy” chips taste like cardboard. I didn’t want to nibble on something that felt like a compromise. I wanted crunch. I wanted flavor. I wanted to *actually enjoy* what I was eating.

When I started my MBA, I met Nora — a food science wizard with a passion for better ingredients. We hit it off immediately. One night, over coffee and a shared rant about the sad state of “healthy” snacking, we asked ourselves: *What if we could make a chip that actually had it all?*

Protein-packed. Clean ingredients. Real flavor. No post-snack regret.

That conversation became a brainstorm, which became a recipe, which became *Eggmond Chips*. A chip made with egg whites and almonds — high in protein, low in carbs, and surprisingly craveable. Not just a snack you *settle* for, but one you *look forward to*.

We built Eggmond Chips for anyone who’s ever felt that 9PM snack-craving despair. For those juggling ambition and health. For people like me — who refuse to compromise.

Because better snacks aren't just about eating differently. They're about living better.",1,1745554229.0,lowcarb,0,1.0,False

I’ve been a specialty coffee enthusiast for 6 years, brewing daily with various methods (V60, Chemex, AeroPress, etc.), but I avoid espresso. I source high-quality beans (88+ points) directly from farmers, and I’ve stopped visiting local cafés due to their focus on espresso, lack of filtered coffee expertise (even SCA-certified spots make basic mistakes), and high prices.

My concern: **I’m unsure if my home brewing is truly good or if I’ve adapted to subpar flavors without professional references**. With few skilled baristas nearby and a local market that prioritizes aesthetics over quality, I worry about perpetuating bad practices or missing growth opportunities.

**Questions:**

1. How can I objectively evaluate/refine my recipes without reliable café benchmarks?
2. Any tips for avoiding ""palate bias"" after years of solo brewing?
3. For those in similar environments: How do you stay inspired and improve?

It had zero issues other than usb ports needing replaced (previous owner spilled coffee in them). Dealer agreed to replace them at later date under the warranty. In the process of replacing them, they screwed up the audio system and now my speakers do not work at all. They tested the Mark levinson amplifier - no issue there. After diagnosis from Lexus dealership, they said they need to replace the entire head unit as it may have shorted. 

Has anyone dealt with this issue before and is it common with GX’s? After speaking with Lexus, they believe the dealer I purchased the vehicle from incorrectly disconnected power from the battery and it created a power surge and shorted the radio. The dealer is now trying to say they are not at fault and they are willing to replace with an aftermarket head unit as a “gesture of good faith” (BS). 

At this point, the dealer is unwilling to order OEM head unit from lexus because it’s too expensive - even though it’s their service techs fault.

So this problem has been going on for... maybe a year, or 18 months... And yeah I know I should have gotten it checked out sooner, but usually the problem goes away quick enough that it tends to not be such as a problem. ANYWAYS.

Every now and again I'll experience what \*seems\* like an epic level of constipation that just doesnt make sense to me. I usually intake a pretty fiberous diet. I do Greek Yogurt with Whole Grains, I eat whole grain bread, I eat granola bars, vegetables, seeded fruits... I also take Fiber Supplements.

This seems to always happen right around the time when I'm also trying to diet too. I'm fairly overweight, 268 pounds and every time I try to do something about it, this always seems to happen and it steals almost all my of focus and usually ends up with me binging foods trying to trigger me to ""go"": coffee, dairy, metamucil, Taco Bell...

And before you ask, yes I'm drinking a lot of water. I'm trying to make sure I stay hydrated.

The reason I DON'T think its constipation is when I finally DO go it's... pretty soft. I don't see how any of this could cause any kind of blockage.

Another problem on top of this seems to also be this burning feeling I get in my rectum area which gets more and more irritated the more I ""go"" to the point where I'm trying to apply Hemmeroid ointment to it to try and calm it down but it just doesn't ever seem to go away.

Here's the kicker that makes this all the more annoying. I don't have insurance.. I don't have a job anymore... lost it in January. So now I definitely need to figure this out at home...

He has 7 sisters and he’s the only guy. I’ve always seen all of them as older sisters, nothing weird. I used to spend almost every day there, so even with him gone, it feels normal for me to be around.

For context, I’m 22. His sisters range from 26 to 43, so I’ve always been kind of “the baby” in the group. They’ve known me for years, and I’ve always felt like the younger brother.

But lately, his 28-year-old sister has been acting kind of strange. She’s asked me to go out a few times, just the two of us, her treat, and I always thought it was just because we’re close. I figured she sees me like a little brother or something, nothing more.

But today was weird. She texted me, “Where are you?” and when I replied, “Why?” she said, “I want to see you.” I told her I was already at their house, just chilling with one of her sisters. She wasn’t home at the time, but not long after, she came back.

When she arrived, she came out to where we were, gave me a kiss on the cheek (which she’s never done before), said “It’s a hi,” super casually, and then just went inside. She didn’t come sit with us or hang out, just disappeared into the house.

Later that night, after I got home, she sent me a reel on Instagram. I reacted to it like I usually do, and then she messaged me, “Want to go out tomorrow for coffee?”

Now I’m just sitting here like… is this normal friendly energy or is something actually going on? I’ve always been like a little brother to all of them, am I reading too much into it? Should I tell my friend? Am I tripping?",6,1745553986.0,Advice,11,0.8,False

One minute you’re ready to tackle the world, and the next, you’re lost in a sea of thoughts, wondering if you left the iron on or if that last piece of pizza was really worth it. 🍕 

But what if I told you that you can boost your mental clarity in just 10 seconds? Yep, you heard that right! Let’s break it down and get those brain gears turning smoothly again. 💡

### Here’s the magic formula:

1. **Breathe it out**: Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a second, and exhale through your mouth like you’re blowing out birthday candles. 🎂 You’d be surprised how just a few breaths can clear the fog.

2. **Quick Grounding**: Close your eyes and name three things you can hear, feel, and see. Sounds silly? Maybe. But trust me, it pulls you right back into the moment. It’s like a mini-reset button for your mind.

3. **Stretch it out**: Stand up (yes, right now, get those legs moving!) and stretch your arms up towards the sky. Literally reaching for new ideas. 🌌 Get that blood flowing—we all know a little movement can do wonders, right?

4. **Visualize Your Goal**: Take a quick second to picture what you’re trying to accomplish. That email you need to send, the project you need to finish, or the personal goal you’re chasing. A clear mind starts with a clear vision!

5. **Gratitude Snap**: Think of one thing you’re grateful for. It can be as simple as that first sip of coffee or a great song playing. Gratitude helps reset your emotional state, and yes, it’s a game-changer. 🙏 

### Why does this work? 

- **Stress Reduction**: When you feel overwhelmed, your brain goes haywire. Taking a few moments to breathe and stretch can lower cortisol levels, making room for clarity.
- **Mindfulness**: Engaging your senses pulls you into the present, shaking off that haze of distraction. It’s like being in an old-school video game where you gotta avoid the ghosts and focus on scoring points. 💥
- **Energy Boost**: Getting up and moving around? Instant energy boost! Who needs caffeine when challenging yourself to a quick brain break will wake you up faster than a triple espresso?

If you think about it, what’s an extra 10 seconds in your day? It’s just the time it takes to scroll through your social media feed (or watch a hilarious cat video, let's be honest 😹). So why not invest that tiny slice of time into getting your head back in the game?

Now, go ahead—give these steps a whirl and watch how quickly you shift from squirrel-brained chaos to laser-focused clarity. Got any other quick fixes you swear by? Let’s hear them!",1,1745553741.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/TSGwQjwqvu): **February 28, 2025**

I (34f) have 2 sisters who I'll call Sally (31f) and Bea (28f). I am close to both - or thought I was...

Bea got married a few years ago and had been having fertility issues. She and her husband finally conceived through IVF and I was ecstatic for her when I found out she was pregnant.

There have been a few times over the years where I've felt purposely left out of things. I was the only one who never got an invitation to Bea's graduation (she thought i wouldn't want to go), when pur grandfather passed away they had a big family get together a few days later (I was the only one not invited - they didnt think I'd want to go...again).

When Bea had her baby shower she organised it on a day where she knew i wouldn't be able to attend. Alrhough upset at missing out, I dropped off at my parents a beautiful hamper full of things I'd been buying for the baby and Bea and included a hand made blanket that one of my aunts (recently passed) hand knitted for my little boy when she found out I was pregnant 6 years ago.

Throughout her pregnancy Bea has said that the day she had the baby she only wanted our parents and her husbands parents to visit the hospital and that then they wanted the first 24hrs at home by themselves with no visitors as they have a dog and wanted him to get used to baby first- totally understandable and fine by me.

Bea has had multiple medical complications throughout her pregnancy which has meant she had to have an early C- Section. I spoke to Bea the day before and told her my day was clear (at work but not alot on) and that if she needed me she knew where I was and that I couldn't wait to hear from her (we didn't know the gender or anything so very excited)

On the day, I get an FB call around 1pm from Bea in which she and my dad introduced me to my beautiful nephew. I was delighted. Bea then handed the phone to my mum as a nurse came in. My mum then informed me that Sally was there....

My joy turned into devastation. I asked my mum why i hadnt been invited to the hospital too. She said because I was working that they hadn't thought I'd be able to go. I told her that was an issue for me to deal with and that if I'd asked, my manager would have let me leave to enjoy the moment with my family, but instead they were all there enjoying that beautiful moment without me...again. I hung up in tears from my mum. I've removed myself from the family group chat. I spoke to my manager at work who said she would have definitely let me leave for the afternoon and was shocked my family have done that.

I messaged my mum afterwards and told her how upset I was and her response was ""I'm sorry you feel that way"". My manager said she's gaslighting me and said my feelings are absolutely valid

But was i overreacting? AITA for hanging up on my family?

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA. I don’t know why, but I have this feeling Bea is behind a lot of this. It sounds like you had children first and she had struggled.

But whatever the reason behind your families, attitude and actions is, I want you to realize that none of it is your fault. They are making active choices to exclude you.

And I know that hurts you very much. And the hard part is that you may never know why.

But I have daughters close to your ages, and I would never have allowed something like this to go on. If you’re having a problem with another family member, you work it out, or you suck it up and go wherever they’re going to be. But I will not exclude someone else because you refuse to deal with whatever your issues are.

You are not the asshole, and you definitely need to go no contact. I would stop calling. I would stop contacting them. And as much as I hate to say it, they will probably not even notice because they’re already excluding you.

This is not how family acts. And when your family tries to gaslight you later on, don’t fall for it. Call them out on this shit. Tell him that’s bullshit. You say every time you didn’t think I’d want to go, but you never ask. So don’t fucking try to pin your attitudes and whatever this exclusionary tactic is on me. And then hang up the phone.

Create your own family with your in-laws and your friends who really care about you. The fact that all of us are appalled by your families behavior, as is your own boss should tell you everything you need to know.

> **OOP:** I honestly have no idea why they are like this with me. I always thought I had good strong relationships with both my parents and my sisters.
> 
> I am the eldest of the 3 and when I had my son I was 28, Bea was only 21 (nearly 22) so still quite young do I don't think that i had kids first is anything to do with it.
> 
> My partner and my MIL and SIL are livid with how I was treated and have agreed I'm not the AH in any way.
> 
> I just don't know how to move forward. I'm devastated

**Commenter 2:** NTA. Not overreacting. Your family does not like you. I am sorry that sounds harsh but they really don’t give a damn about you.

Have they ever expressed a reason why they constantly do not invite you to major events in their lives? Have they always done this, even when you all were children.

It is just so toxic and emotionally abusive.

They have shown you who they are and what they think about you. It is up to you if you want to continue to pursue this relationship with them, and hope to get more than scraps, or just stop.

It is also up to you to approach them individually and ask them why they never include you in anything. Or, you can say to Hell with it and not bother wasting time getting some lame ass answer from them. Focus on yourself and your own family

> **OOP:** Honestly, it didn't start happening until I moved out of the family home. I was 20 when I moved out and so have been extremely independent for a long time. But that doesn't negate the fact that I still don't get invited to things. Alot of the time they say it's because I have a son with additional needs (can't get babysitter etc) but I have a very good relationship with my sons father who works in childcare and swaps his shifts so I can attend family gatherings, such as Bea's wedding. My family know this so that's not an excuse either

**Commenter 3:** This is going to sound harsh/sad, but I don’t think it’s that they don’t think you can handle it. I suspect there is ableism involved and they don’t want your son there.

> **OOP:** I hope that isn't the case but starting to think this might be one of the possible reasons as to why unfortunately

**Commenter 4:** Families don’t usually abandon loved family members without a reason. Have you done something that has upset them many times? Do you behave a certain way around them? I would ask them straight up why they are behaving this way, and go on from there.

> **OOP:** Honestly, no. I visit my family every 2 weeks when my son is home with me so we can all spend time together. I stay in touch with both my sisters, meet for coffees etc. I always thought I had a strong loving bond with all my family members

**Commenter 5:** Are you an alcoholic or something? Is there some reason you're not telling us why they wouldn't want you around? Because NTA otherwise

> **OOP:** Nope. No drugs, no alcohol, no major issues. I've always been fairly close with my family. We communicate daily, spend weekends together that sort of thing.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/SyGkc1m8uk): **March 2, 2025 (two days later)**

First off, I just want to thank everyone for all of your supportive comments and to those who have shared their own stories. I've taken the time to read through everything the last few days.

So after Thursday, I didn't hear anything from my family at all until today (Sunday). I was scrolling g through FB and saw that all of my BILs family were at the hospital on Thursday too. So the only people not invited were myself, my SO and my son.

I messaged my mother after I saw this and explained how I was now even more upset and asked what I have done. Her response was that I've done absolutely nothing, not to my sister or anyone. She tried making out that Sally went to the hospital of her own volition which I do not believe. She would not have just turned up. She would have asked.

My mum said that because I was working they had assumed I couldn't get time off. I explained how I manage my work is up to me. If they'd asked and I'd declined, that would be another matter entirely

Anyway, I've told my mother I'm going low contact, how this isn't the first time I've been excluded and that I'm deeply hurt by their actions. So that's it for now. I'm going to focus on my little family and my in laws, who I saw today and were very loving and supportive.

Again thank you to everyone for taking the time to read and comment. It meant alot

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA, and LC or NC sounds like the best decision for you and your family. They are deliberately excluding you with no explanation that makes sense. A couple of things did stick out to me after reading both of your posts and some comments.

You said your family started leaving you out after your son was born. Was it before or after he was diagnosed with learning disabilities? It seems like that's an odd time to start leaving you out. Are your partner and son invited to events, or are they left out too?

Also, you say you're close to your whole family, but you only mention talking to your mom in your posts and what she's said to you. Have your dad and sisters said things similar to what your mom's said? Or is it only from your mom?

> **OOP:** I haven't heard anything from anybody else in my family. Nobody else has contacted me. I only contacted my mum last night because I'd seen all the pics on FB with other relatives at the hospital

**Commenter 2:** Good for you But I am really curious for the fact the entire family seems to be regularly excluding you And that nobody is even speaking up for you Personally I think ur sister might be spreading around stores
> 
> **OOP:** My son would not have been coming with me to the hospital.
And you're absolutely right. My SO is an absolute saint- I totally agree and we have been working on my sons behaviour together over the last few months to decrease any sort of disruptive behaviour. He's an absolute one of of a kind
> 
> **Commenter 2:** Sorry everybody keeps harassing you about this. How dare you make a mistake, and then learn from it? Especially if it includes your autistic child or being a single mother.
> 
> That’s all so stupid. Everyone screws up. I’m glad y’all seemed to have grown from it. Which is what we usually applaud people for, apparently unless we can throw it back in their face at some point.
> 
> This also doesn’t seem like a valid reason to me. If that were the problem, I would hope someone would respect her enough to be honest with her, and say that occasionally there were some gatherings that might not be the most autistic friendly. But that should really only be for the benefit of the child, not the comfort of the adults around him who apparently can’t act like grown ups. It also doesn’t explain (to me anyway) the cold response from her family about this, especially from her mother.
> 
> That’s her grandchild, bro. That’s supposed to be sacred in any normal functioning family. I have an autistic nephew with his fair share of issues. And yes, it can be disruptive at times, and even difficult. But I’ve never even considered excluding him from anything family related, nor has anybody else that I know of. We wouldn’t dream of it. I would feel like a monster. Just excluding that sweet little boy from his family because of something that isn’t his fault. Screw that noise. And if your parents do end up showering the new kid with love and attention in a way they never did with your son then yes, go no contact immediately. Save your son, and yourself from that kind of abuse. Y’all have each other. I’d rather have a mom that loved and protected me than a whole family of exclusionary twats.
> 
> Stay strong.
> 
>> **OOP:** Thank you so much for this.
>>  
>> Yes I made a mistake and I learned from it. I was a single parent for 2 years to my son and working full time, I let him get away with alot because it made my life just that little bit easier. That's what I was used to.
>> 
>> I'm not alone anymore and I work alongside my partner to make changes that benefit us as a family as a whole.
>> 
>> It's nice to see that someone actually realised this. Plus I wouldn't have taken my son to the hospital either.
>> 
>> I was actually talking to my SO about this last night as he's worried my parents will treat their new grandchildren very differently and if that's the case we will be going NC. It will break my heart for my child as he adores his grandparents but I don't want to promote such a toxic environment either

**Commenter 3:** I think going low contact is giving them too much credit at this point. I would block everyone on everything. If they want to get in touch with you, they will figure out a way to get in touch with you if it’s important to them. Until they make that effort, I don’t know why you wouldn’t want to be in any kind of contact with them.

Sometimes we need to focus on our own families and not the families that were sperm and egg donors to us.

> **OOP:** I'm not going to contact them until they contact me. I wouldn't have last night if I hadn't seen all those photos on FB but it just made me even more angry and due to the comments on my original post I just wanted to know why.
> 
> Their response was that I've done nothing which if that's the case, I don't understand anything that's happened over the last few days.

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/HlQPxMvhb8): **March 5, 2025 (three days later)**

Many of you asked for another update.

Bea contacted me last night

She said she didn't remember ever telling me that no one was allowed at the hospital and that then plan was always for all of her in laws to go and that she had already had a conversation with Sally about her going too.

She said I must have misheard. I gently reminded her that my SO had been sat in the room at the same time she had said ""no one at the hospital other than parents"" so couldn't see how we'd both misheard that? That the first thing he had said to me when I told him Sally was at the hospital was ""she said no one other than yours or BILs parents""

She then said she had been upset that I hadn't reached out to her after the facetime call to check on her and the baby and that she'd refused to 'chase me'. I told her that I had no idea what had been going on, whether she'd been discharged or anything, and that as a new mum I figured she wanted some time which is understandable. I didn't expect her to chase me.

She told me that they've had to go back to the hospital daily since they were discharged as the baby has been poorly. I told her I'm sorry about that - i genuinely am - and that i hope he gets better soon.

She asked me when I'm going to see the baby. I told her I didn't know and that it would depend on an invitation. She told me the invitation is ""open"" but that she's feeling really sore and bruised at the minute (understandable) and doesn't know how she's going to feel so that I need to put some time aside and check with them first if we did want to go through.

I left at that in the end as it was gone 10pm and needed some sleep. I'm honestly not too sure what to do. I spoke with my SO last night who laid his thoughts and feelings down (total NC) but that he will support me whatever I decide to do.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Whatever you decide to do you gotta pull back. Spend the time and money on your own family instead.

> **OOP:** I plan to do that regardless. It's good to know I have my SO and my in laws on my side at least

**Commenter 2:** I agree with no contact. Don't let them gaslight you. An open invitation but you have to check it is ok first before you go is not an open invitation. Any time you pick won't be a good time. 

> **OOP:** No and I got that feeling when we were talking last night. I'm just going to leave it for now I think and wait and see whether I do get an actual invitation or not. I doubt I will and I'm not chasing for one either

**Commenter 3:** Was she planning to lie until you said your SO was present with you when she mentioned the visitor limitations? She's terrible. And the door is open, but you need to call ahead to check. It sounds like whenever you want to visit, they're going to come up with excuses for you not to visit. I would definitely go no-contact. Don’t let them continue to gaslight you. They're terrible people.

> **OOP:** It certainly seemed like it until I reminded her SO had been sat in the same room as us. And that was my thought about visiting room so I'm certainly not going to chase

+

> I'm glad he was there too otherwise I think i might have started to think that i was going crazy! And I will be matching their energy from now on. Thank you 😊

**Commenter 4:** You can't keep lighting yourself on fire, trying to keep everyone warm. You will just burn yourself out,and they will complain the warmth wasn't enough.

> **OOP:** That's a very good analogy 👏 I plan to go NC for a while now and see what happens although I don't think anything will so I'm going to focus on my SO, my son and my in laws now

**Is Bea the golden child?**

> **OOP:** Yeah i suppose she is. She was the baby, she followed in mums footsteps job wise.... and I will

&nbsp;

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/UKRZ6GU73U): **March 12, 2025 (one week later)**

So I messaged Bea back and told her that when she was feeling up to it, to let me know a day and we would go through. She left me on read and didn't respond. That's fine. I'm letting her get on with it.

As for my mum she's been sending messages and trying to facetime me. I've barely been responding to her messages. I haven't heard anything from Sally or my dad the last 2 weeks.

This evening my mum facetimed. I wouldn't have answered it but my son was sat next to me and got giddy when he saw his grandmother pop up on my phone so I did. She tried to act all normal and nicey nice but I was blunt. I could tell she was miffed at the end of the call that i was still being off with her. After the call I messaged her (probably shouldn't have done but I did and it's done now) and told her that until I got a proper face to face apology that this is the way it's going to be.

She messaged back and said she's apologised loads (she sent that ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" and one message that did say that she was sorry, but in the middle of all the other waffle that came with it - and nothing face to face) and I told her that she'd tried to gaslight me the first time and only tried to apologise once over a text.

She facetimed me again and told me that she had not tried to gaslight me that she was sorry that I felt that way and that (and I quote) ""you just let your feelings get the better of you"". I told her again that no, that's not an apology. That my feelings are valid.

She then said she was sorry, turned on the waterworks and told me she couldn't do this anymore and hung up

So....yeah. that's it up to this point.

Other than that I've been good. Just focusing on my son and SO and my day to day stuff with work etc. I've actually been okay and sort of come to terms with the fact that I'm not going to have that close knit relationship with my family any more. But that that's okay. I have my SO, my son and my in laws. They're the ones who need to be the important people in my life now

I doubt there'll be another update now but thank you to everyone for taking the time to read and comment. It's really helped 😊❤️.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** OP, tbh, you never had .......

> to have that close knit relationship with my family any more.

You just now take back your dignity and grew a backbone. Good for you!!!!

I wish you the best. It is important to keep the people close that support you unconditionally.

> **OOP:** And to be honest, I feel better. I've stood up for myself to her face and feel great actually. But I'm so done with them now. Time to focus on my little family and be whole ❤️

**Downvoted Commenter:** I don’t know OP I’m kinda feeling you wanting a special invitation is kind of weird. I remember having my kid and I would have people say this to me. Let me know when you’re up for company and I’m just like show up and if I say no, then go away.
>
> **OOP:** I don't want to just show up though. That's pushing it a bit for me even if it is my sister. When I had my son, the first few weeks, I would invite people when and if I felt up to it
>> 
>> **Downvoted Commenter:** Yeah, but isn’t that what she asked of you and isn’t that how the other sister ended up at the hospital she just showed up? From an outsider looking in the sister that showed up just showed up and then the sisters had the baby said screw it other family can come then because her plans went out the window.
>>>
>>> **OOP:** No, they'd actually already arranged for my other sister to go prior to her having the baby. And Bea told me some that she'd already arranged for other relatives to go too. I was the only one not invited and told that no.one was invited to the hospital

&nbsp;

[Update #4](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Ebd4e4vqc3): **April 5, 2025 (3.5 weeks later)**

Okay..... I honestly didn't think thered be another update but here goes. This only happened today and I'm still feeling a bit unsure about things and am still very upset.

So over the last few weeks alot has happened. My mum and dad have both apologised and we're working on our relationship whether you agree with that or not - thats the decision ive made.

Sally also came to see me and we talked through the whole situation like adults. We both apologised to one another for how we made the other feel and we've been okay since. Not back to normal but better than it was. Whilst Sally was at mine she suggested I be the bigger person and reach out to Bea. After a few days and mulling her words I messaged Bea and told her I would be taking my son to see our parents today. She said she would come through to see us.

My son, SO and I got to my parents this morning for 10am - we had to leave at 11.30 as weve had other things going on today. 45mins later Bea shows up with her baby (now 5 weeks old). My mum asked Bea to let me hold him. Bea refused and said we needed to talk first, which was fine.

I commented on the baby, asked how they were all doing and even gave her a gift that me and my SO had picked up the other week (just a stuffed toy, nothing crazy). Bea gave me one word answers with my mum filling in all the other details. At one point Bea handed the baby to my mum and left the room for about 10mins. My mum asked me to go and see her. I refused as she'd barely acknowledged any of us since she came into the house. She came back in and again, barely spoke.

As we were packing up to go Bea said she was sorry for being quiet but that she was feeling awkward after 5 weeks. She said that I'd upset her by not contacting her to check on her and the baby. I told her that I knew she'd had a lot on being a new mum, baby is exclusively BF, not alot of sleep and that she was recovering from surgery and I hadnt wanted to hound her. She started shouting at me calling me ridiculous and that that's not what sisters do. That sisters are there for one another and I'd hurt her feelings.

She continued to shout at me (whilst holding her baby) about that she never said i couldn't go to the hospital, that I'd misconstrued what she had said and that she doesn't know how this will be fixed.

My SO, mum and dad tried to difuse the situation by saying they could see both sides and that even though we were frustrated with one another she needed to calm down and just talk. Bea then started shouting at my parents saying she was sick of them taking my side.

At that point I couldn't even say anything. My son was in the room and picking up on the frustration and anger from Bea and asking to go. I told my family we were leaving. My mum and dad followed us out and I broke down when I got in the car. My mum asked me to go back inside. I couldn't. I was too angry and needed to remain calm for my son and for the drive home. Bea came to the door with the baby and said she didn't want me to go like this. I told her tough. I'd tried and all she'd done was shout at me.

My SO tried to get me to turn around and go back but I couldn't bring myself too. I was so upset I just wanted to come home.

My mum rang me when we got home asking if I was okay. I broke down again and said no. That I'd tried but all Bea had done was shout at me and tried making me out to be a liar. She'd taken absolutely zero accountability for what she'd said to me and my SO all those weeks ago. My mum and dad actually both commended me for staying so calm whilst Bea had shouted. I told my mum that I refuse to be a parent that loses it in front of her kid and in order for me to remain calm, I'd needed to leave.

My mum and SO say I should contact Bea again once I've calmed down but I honestly don't know what to even say at this point. So yeah..... for those that are interested in any of this, that's where we are right now...

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Oh boy, family drama with a side of newborn chaos? A classic episode of ""As the Baby Cries!"" I mean, who knew that bringing a new life into the world would also bring out the Olympic-level shouting matches.

> **OOP:** Honestly if I'd have thought I couldnt have had a proper conversation with her like I did my other sister I never would have gone!

**Commenter 2:** Nah, she can contact you. In the meantime, find the positive and just be there for your son.

> **OOP:** I plan too. The only reason I didn't start shouting back was because he was there and I wasn't gonna start kicking off in front of him

**Commenter 3:** Did your parents or other sister ever explain why you were left out a lot of the times? Is Bea their favourite?

> **OOP:** Bea is definitely the golden child. She's the youngest, the only one that went to university, followed our mum's career path in terms of nursing etc

**Commenter 4:** Well, it must be very frustrating for Bea that the reality check of not getting her way a lot of the time is in this post birth period. Where one often finds out that a baby does not care about their parents way. Not saying that this matters in your decision making. It sounds like the reality check was long overdue.

You were right to walk away and not compete in a yelling match. Bea's frustration is not your responsibility and her way of handling it even less.

She might come around, but even if she doesn't, you were doing the right things: concentrating on your own family and the ones that support you, standing up for you.

> **OOP:** My son certainly didn't need to be subject to that kind of behaviour. Whether she comes around or not i expect an apology from her just for starting to kick off in front of him

Chapter 1 — After the Amnesia, He Was the Only One I Forgot

The day my boyfriend's first love returned home, I was being asked by him to have sex with him in

the car in lace erotic lingerie.

To meet his first love, he kicked me out of the car, causing me to be knocked unconscious by the car

on the spot.

When I woke up, I found myself sleeping with a strange man ......

Six Years Later, I Returned With Three Genius Babies - The

My ex-boyfriend kneels in front of me and begs to get back together, and is blocked by the triplets,

“Sorry, our mommy doesn't recycle garbage!”

And the object of my one-night stand, the world's richest billionaire, transferred all the assets in his

name to me:

“Honey, when are you and the babies going to admit me to the world?”

----------------------------------------------

When Jax kicks Willow out of the car, she's wearing nothing but a tantalizing piece of lingerie.

The rain was relentless. She wrapped her arms around her nearly bare body, begging Jax not to leave her on the highway.

His final act of mercy was tossing a thin coat out the window.

""Elena just called to say she's back in the country. I'm going to pick her up now.""

""You need to think about why you're so immature. She just got back—obviously she needs me more than you do.""

Willow clutched her stomach in pain, sitting helplessly by the roadside, watching the car speed away.

Cars whizzed past on both sides. She thought she saw people rolling down their windows, staring at her like she was a joke.

""Hey, look at that slut—whoring herself out on the freeway? How much for a night?""

The cruel jeers echoed in her ears.

If she could scream, she would've told them she was still a virgin. That she had worn the damn lingerie because Jax asked her to. That she thought—maybe, just maybe—he'd finally look at her.

But all she could do was shake her head and shiver.

She didn't realize danger was approaching.

The last thing she remembered was a car skidding toward her.

After the accident, Willow lost her memory.

She still remembered her adoptive parents, her friends—even the barista at the café on the corner.

But one person—she couldn't remember at all.

Jax.

When Grace, her best friend, found out at the hospital, she was so shocked she dropped her iced coffee to the floor.

""Willow… You're not playing some twisted game of hard to get, are you? Faking amnesia just to get my brother's attention?""

Willow blinked in confusion, her voice soft and genuinely puzzled.

""Your brother? Who is he?""

Grace froze. A few seconds later, her expression changed completely.

""You're not acting? Then swear it!""

""Alright,"" Willow said calmly. ""If I'm lying, may I never remember him again.""

The vow hit Grace like a thunderbolt. She stood paralyzed for a moment before gripping Willow's shoulders.

""You really… really forgot my brother—no, forgot the name Jax?""

""Is that bad?"" Willow asked, frowning. ""Was he important to me?""

Grace's face twisted with complicated emotions.

""Jax… He's the guy you chased for seven whole years. The one you swore you'd marry, no matter what.""

Willow's mind went blank.

""So… is he my boyfriend now?"" she asked tentatively.

""No,"" Grace said awkwardly. ""He's always been distant. He only has one person in his heart—his first love, Elena. Because of her, he rejected you—and everyone else.""

""In fact… the reason you got into the accident was because he went to the airport to pick up Elena, leaving you alone on the highway.""

Willow was stunned.

Grace handed her the phone. Willow tried unlocking it, but no code came to mind.

""It's his birthday now—0122,"" Grace said.

Willow entered it. The screen lit up.

Thousands of photos of a man flooded the screen. His face—handsome to the point of being unreal—stole her breath for a moment.

""Well,"" she murmured, ""he's definitely my type.""

But in all those photos, Jax's gaze toward her was ice-cold, void of warmth.

She opened the notes app—there were pages upon pages of detailed records:

He likes black coffee, hates cilantro, is afraid of cats...

And then, the diary entries—hundreds of them—each one an attempt to get closer to him, to win his affection. All met with silence.

""Seventh Valentine's Day. I rehearsed my confession a hundred times. Still rejected, just like every year. You say we'll never happen, Jax… but why can't I let go?""

""He got drunk again tonight. Mistook me for Elena. Held me and called her name over and over. That's when I realized—we're both pathetic in love.""

Willow couldn't remember any of it.

But the tears still fell.

Grace broke the silence.

""So… what now? Are you going to keep trying to recover your memory? My uncle's a top psychiatrist—he can help you get treatment overseas.""

""No need,"" Willow said quietly. ""If I loved him that much, and it hurt that badly, maybe forgetting is a second chance.""

She deleted the photos one by one. Cleared the entire notes app.

Grace was stunned and tried to stop her, but before she could say more, her phone rang.

She glanced at the screen, her expression changing.

""I have to head home—something urgent came up. Wait for me, I'll be back soon.""

The room fell quiet again.

A few minutes later, the landline rang.

""Willow,"" the voice on the other end of the phone carried obvious anxiety, ""do you still remember that marriage contract that was set before? Their side has already urged several times ...... Our family really can't hold out now, if you don't marry, the family may go bankrupt.""

She expected Willow to refuse. But after a moment's thought, Willow's voice came back soft but firm:

""Alright. Once I'm discharged, I'll go through with the marriage.""

Silence lingered on the line.

""You… you don't love Jax anymore?""

Willow didn't know how to explain the amnesia, and she didn't want them to worry about the accident.

So she gave a vague answer, choosing her words carefully.

""I don't love him now. And I never will again.""

Chapter 2 — I Don't Love You Anymore

After hanging up the phone, Willow glanced at the calendar, roughly estimating how long it would take to tie up loose ends.

Without hesitation, she booked a one-way ticket to Santawill City for two weeks later.

Just as she confirmed the flight, a nurse knocked on her door.

""Miss Windsor, it's time for your follow-up appointment.""

She nodded and eased herself into the wheelchair, following the nurse out of the room.

What she didn't expect was that, the moment the elevator doors opened, she'd come face to face with the very man whose photos she had scrolled through countless times just days ago—

Jax Monroe.

The one person she had completely forgotten after her memory loss.

And in that moment, when he saw her, his expression hardened into ice. His gaze was sharp and biting.

""How did you know I was here? You followed me to the hospital too?""

Willow froze.

This was her first time seeing Jax in person since the accident.

She had thought it might feel awkward, unfamiliar, maybe even bittersweet.

What she hadn't expected… was disgust.

""You've misunderstood,"" she said quietly, barely audible. ""I was in a car accident. I've been recovering here. I didn't follow you.""

Jax gave her a cold, scrutinizing look, as if assessing her every word. Just as he was about to speak, a nearby hospital room door opened.

A woman stepped out.

His entire demeanor shifted in an instant—his sharpness softened, his features gentled—and he rushed over.

""Elena, you're still running a fever. I told you to stay in bed. Why are you up?""

At the sound of that name, Willow instinctively turned her head.

The woman wore a flowing white dress, with chestnut hair cascading down her shoulders and porcelain skin that almost glowed under the hospital lights.

She gave Willow a polite smile and asked gently, ""The room was stuffy. I just needed some fresh air. Jax, who's this?""

""She's Willow Windsor,"" Jax replied calmly. ""A friend of my sister's. She works in our design department. We're not particularly close.""

Willow listened as he introduced her. His tone was measured and distant—like he was describing a stranger he had barely interacted with.

Elena smiled warmly, her voice soft. ""Nice to meet you, Willow. Your head is bandaged… were you in an accident?""

""A car accident,"" Willow nodded. ""Mild concussion. Some memories are… still a little unclear.""

She hadn't even finished her sentence when a nurse called out from down the hall:

""Willow Windsor, bed 1124—time for your scans.""

Willow gave a quick nod to both of them, murmured a goodbye, and turned away in her wheelchair, heading for the examination room.

Behind her, Jax frowned slightly, his gaze lingering on her.

Wasn't she the one who used to chase after him with a smile, refusing to give up, always trying to talk to him?

Now… she left without a second glance?

—

After her scans, Willow went to the pharmacy to collect her prescriptions.

On the way back, the early spring sunshine filtering through the hospital courtyard tempted her. She rolled her wheelchair toward the fountain, basking in the warmth.

Just as she reached the edge of the pool, a familiar figure approached.

""Elena?"" she asked, slightly surprised.

The woman smiled and nodded. ""What a coincidence. I came out for some air too.""

Willow returned the smile politely, about to make small talk, when Elena walked over naturally and took over pushing her wheelchair, speaking breezily:

""Jax had to take a call, left me on my own. I was getting bored out of my mind. Since I ran into you, mind if we chat for a bit?""

She paused briefly, then added, her tone slightly probing,

""I heard you and Jax have worked together for years. When I was overseas, someone mentioned there was a woman who chased him for seven years, relentlessly. Do you… happen to know who that was?""

Willow's fingers paused slightly on the armrest, but her heart didn't skip a beat.

She looked up at the graceful woman beside her and smiled, her voice calm and composed.

""I'm not sure who that was. But if someone pursued him for seven years, and he still only has eyes for you, then it's clear—you're the one who truly matters to him. Everyone else… doesn't.""

She said it with a serene grace, without the slightest tremor.

And as Elena listened, the smile at the corner of her mouth froze slightly for a moment.

Chapter 3 — Pushed Into the Water

Elena blinked in surprise at Willow's calm and certain response, her expression suddenly softening with a hint of shyness.

""You… know about Jax and me? Has he… mentioned me recently?""

Willow remembered what Grace had told her—how deeply Jax once loved Elena. She nodded.

""He said he did.""

A flush crept up Elena's cheeks, her eyes glowing with barely concealed joy.

""He was a year ahead of me—back at Westbrook University. He was the kind of guy everyone looked up to, ridiculously outstanding. There was never a shortage of girls chasing him, but somehow, he chose me. Back then, I always felt he was way out of my league… but he still insisted on pursuing me for months.""

A nostalgic smile curved her lips, and her voice softened as she continued.

""We were together for four years. He spoiled me in every way—studying with me at the library, filling the campus square with roses on Valentine's Day. And anytime another guy tried talking to me, he'd get so jealous, it was almost funny.""

Willow said nothing. She just listened, quietly.

""Before graduation, he proposed,"" Elena went on, ""but I turned him down. I didn't want to become someone's future wife and get stuck in that role. I had my own dreams, my own path. So I left him and went to London to study.""

""But I always knew he never really let me go. Even now, when I came back, he braved a thunderstorm just to pick me up at the airport. That moment… I realized he was still waiting for me.""

""I've been feeling unwell these past few days, and he's been taking care of me, day and night. I thought he was going to bring up getting back together… but he never said anything. I started wondering if someone else had entered his world while I was gone.""

Willow's expression didn't waver. She simply smiled, calm and composed.

""If he still cares about you, maybe he's just planning something more special to restart things between you. Don't worry—he could be preparing a surprise.""

Elena visibly relaxed, the tension in her shoulders easing.

She raised her hand to wave goodbye—but her phone suddenly slipped from her fingers and dropped into the fountain with a splash.

Startled, she instinctively bent down to retrieve it, but lost her balance and fell in.

Willow froze for a second, then quickly turned her wheelchair around to go call for help.

Just as she wheeled past the flowerbed, Jax appeared like a thunderbolt.

Without hesitation, he dove into the water and pulled Elena out.

She coughed violently, her face pale, and Jax held her tightly, whispering reassurances in a frantic voice, worry written all over his face.

Willow watched the scene silently. Her heart sank a little, but she still turned to head for help.

That's when Jax suddenly snapped his head up, his eyes burning with fury.

""You did this, didn't you?!"" he roared. ""You pushed her in—now you're trying to play innocent and walk away?!""

Willow's mind went blank.

""No… She dropped her phone and slipped. I didn't touch her—""

""Liar!"" Jax's face twisted in rage. ""I stepped away for a few minutes and she ends up in the water—with only you there? Who else could it be?""

Before she could say another word, he stormed up to her, grabbed the handles of her wheelchair, and shoved it hard toward the fountain.

The moment the chair hit the edge, Willow tumbled into the water.

The cold hit her like a thousand needles.

""I put up with your obsession before, but Elena is off-limits!"" he growled from the edge. ""If you don't know your place, don't blame me for being cruel.""

He made a gesture. Two security guards appeared from nearby and blocked off the pathway.

Willow thrashed in the water, coughing violently as icy liquid rushed into her lungs. Her injured leg split open again, blood blossoming in the water like ink.

She was losing strength fast, her vision going dark.

The last thing she saw… was Jax walking away, carrying Elena in his arms.

And then—

Darkness.

—

She didn't know how long she was out.

When Willow finally opened her eyes again, Grace's tear-streaked face was the first thing she saw—her expression caught somewhere between anguish and rage.

""Are you insane?! The doctors said you would've suffocated if you were found just a minute later! I leave for a few hours and come back to find you nearly drowned?!""

Willow blinked slowly, her mind hazy. She wanted to speak… but the words caught in her throat.

She wanted to tell Grace what her brother had done.

But he was still her brother.

Willow shook her head gently, her voice hoarse and thin.

""I'm fine now… don't worry about me.""

She looked down, her eyes dull and lifeless.

This time, she wasn't just disappointed—

She was done.

Multi-boiler systems, wich coudl appear in a 2025 edition, would further optimize temperature stability and speed.
*   **Durable Components:** Built to withstand the rigors of continuous use,a reliable Mastrena espresso machine features robust components. Durable materials are crucial here. Expect high-quality metal construction, a durable brew group, sturdy bean hopper, and reliable pumps.
*   **Integrated Grinder:** Many Mastrena models come equipped with a built-in grinder, contributing to efficiency and space savings. Precise grind control is essential for optimal espresso extraction.

## Is a Mastrena High volume Espresso Machine Right for You? Consider These Factors

Before investing in a Mastrena or any commercial espresso machine, carefully assess your business needs:

*   **Volume:** How many espresso-based drinks do you serve daily? A Mastrena is best suited for businesses with high-volume demand. If your coffee shop or restaurant is known for churning out lattes and cappucinos, a mastrena will likely pay for itself by keeping your lines moving.
*   **Barista Skill Level:** While the Mastrena simplifies the brewing process, some training is still required.Consider your staff's existing espresso-making skills and the time allocated for training. If your staff is relatively new to espresso, the Mastrena's automation features can significantly reduce the learning curve.
*   **Budget:** The cost of a Mastrena espresso machine can be considerable. Factor in the initial purchase price, installation costs, and ongoing maintenance expenses. Is it more economical to buy a used mastrena espresso machine for sale?
*   **Space:** Commercial espresso machines like the Mastrena can be quite large. Ensure you have adequate counter space and access to necessary utilities (water, electricity).
*   **Menu:** Does your menu primarily consist of espresso-based beverages? A mastrena is ideal for businesses specializing in coffee drinks.

1k7bsi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k7bsi1/my_secret_girlfriend_horror_story_she_told_me_not/,My Secret Girlfriend Horror Story | She Told Me Not to Tell Anyone,"The first time I saw her, she was sitting at the edge of the coffee shop patio, legs crossed, tapping the heel of one sneaker against the chair leg like she was keeping time with music only she could hear. She wasn't loud or showy—just calm and still, like she owned the moment. It's hard to explain, but you'd know it if you saw it. Her hair was tied back in a low ponytail, loose strands framing her face. She'd glance at people as they walked past but never lingered too long, like she was keeping track of the world but wasn't part of it. She wore a dark green jacket—the kind you keep wearing after a hundred rainy days. It looked like it had seen some things and made it through.

I just ordered my drink and was waiting at the counter when she caught me looking at her. Not a glance—full-on eyes locked. An I see you seeing me kind of look. I'm not sure why I didn't look away. I'd like to say it's because I was bold, but the truth is I just froze. She didn't smile, didn't scowl—just raised one eyebrow like she'd caught me mid-crime and was deciding if I'd get away with it. I'd never felt so seen.

When my drink came up, I grabbed it and sat a few tables away from her. I'm not slick, so I'm sure she knew I'd picked that spot on purpose. I'd glance at her, sip my coffee, scroll on my phone like I had something important going on. She'd glance back, tap her sneaker, eyes scanning the street like she was waiting for someone who'd never show up. I'd never been more aware of how much I'd been looking at her until she looked back.

After about ten minutes of this, she got up and walked over. She sat right across from me like it was the most normal thing in the world. No introduction, no ""Hi"" or ""Mind if I join you?""—she just was there. Her eyes were brown, but sharp, like they could cut you if she wanted. Her whole posture said she'd seen this kind of moment before and knew how it ended. She rested her arms on the table and leaned in like we'd been friends for years.

I'm not smooth. Never have been. My brain went blank and I just laughed—quick, nervous, like I'd been caught doing something I shouldn't. She didn't laugh with me, but she didn't leave either.

Over the next couple of weeks, we saw each other almost every day. Coffee shop hangouts turned into late-night drives, fries eaten out of crumpled fast food bags, and long walks with no destination. We'd talk about nothing, but somehow it felt like everything. She'd tell me little pieces of her past—where she'd lived, places she'd been—but never too much. Always just enough to make me want to know more.

I'd text her at midnight just to see if she'd reply. She always did. Sometimes with a song, sometimes just a still awake. And I'd stay up, even when I knew I'd be dead at work the next day, just because it felt like something you'd miss if you didn't.

Being with her was like being pulled into the center of something important—like she'd chosen me for something, and I'd be stupid to walk away from it.

One night, I'm at home on the couch, scrolling through random TV channels with the phone pressed to my ear. I'm catching up with a friend, just talking about work, plans for the weekend, and all that usual stuff. We're halfway through a conversation about a movie he's recommending when, without thinking, I mention—I'm halfway through saying her name—when she's right there. I didn't even hear her get up. She's just there next to me, hand out, palm up.

The look on her face isn't anger. It's sharper than that.

I'm so caught off guard that I hand her the phone without thinking. She's already ended the call before I realize what's happening. My friend's voice cuts off mid-sentence. She's staring at the phone like it's about to explode. Then she looks at me. Her eyes lock on mine, colder than I'd ever seen them.

""No one can know about me. No one.""

Her grip on the phone is tight, like she's ready to crush it. Her gaze pins me in place like I'm a bug under glass. I stay quiet, feeling my pulse tick in my neck. Something about her posture tells me it's not up for discussion. I nod, slow, and she finally releases the phone, her fingers lingering just a little too long.

She says, ""If anyone finds out about me, they will come."" Just that. Nothing more.

Her eyes don't blink.

I ask her who they are, but she won't say. She looks away like she's already said too much. She's quiet for a while after that, and I don't push it. I'm not sure why, but something about the way she's holding herself makes me feel like asking again would be a mistake.

Later that day, one of my co-workers says he saw me with a hot girl. He's laughing, nudging me like it's a big deal, and without thinking I say, ""That's my secret girlfriend."" I tell him to keep it quiet and we both laugh it off—but the second it's out of my mouth, I feel it. Like I've broken some invisible rule.

That night it's 2:00 in the morning and we're at my place. The only light is from the TV, casting blue shadows on the walls. We're on the couch, her legs draped over mine, and I'm thinking about how lucky I got. Her laugh comes easy—the kind of sound you feel in your chest—and before I know it we're kissing. It's slow at first, but it builds, like it always does with her, this steady pull that makes it feel like the world is tilting toward her.

Suddenly there's a knock at the door. It's loud and it makes both of us jump. Not a polite hey you home kind of knock—it's slow and firm, like the sound of someone who knows they'll be let in eventually.

My heart jumps straight into my throat. Easton pulls back, her eyes locked on mine, her face goes still—terrified, listening for something. Her eyes flick toward the door, then back to me. We don't move. Neither of us breathes.

The knock comes again, harder this time, like a fist pounding against wood. Her hand clamps over my mouth and I feel it trembling against my skin. That's when I realize she's really scared—not her usual calm, collected self. She's terrified.

My eyes dart to the door. Easton’s hand is still on my mouth, fingers trembling—and that’s somehow worse than the knock. Her eyes stay on the door, unblinking. I break away and head for the bedroom, heart hammering. I yank open the nightstand drawer, grab the cold metal of the gun, and check the chamber. Her eyes are on me the whole time. She shakes her head slowly, her face pale, eyes pleading.

I grip the gun tighter, ignoring her. I’m not about to be caught off guard tonight. Her fingers twitch like she wants to grab my arm but doesn’t. Her eyes are locked on mine, silently screaming something I don’t want to hear. She moves toward the closet without a sound. I feel the shift in the air as she disappears from view.

Gun at my side, I walk to the door. Every step heavier than the last. My heart’s pounding so loud I’m sure they can hear it. I stop in front of the door, staring at the peephole like it’s a loaded gun aimed at my head. The air feels electric—sharp and thin. I tilt my head, listen hard.

But whoever’s on the other side is silent now.

Waiting.

I stay still, ear tilted toward the door, trying to pick up even the slightest sound.

A soft scratching.

My breath catches in my throat.

The noise is slow and deliberate. It’s measured—like they want me to hear it. The hair on the back of my neck stands up. My fingers tighten on the gun’s grip, my knuckles turning white. My body’s telling me to back away, to get behind something solid—but I can’t. I’m frozen, every muscle tense like if I move, I’ll give away my position.

Another scrape. Higher this time—like whoever’s out there is running something along the top of the door. I glance back toward the closet. Easton’s eyes are just barely visible through the gap in the door—wide and unblinking. She doesn’t move. Doesn’t even flinch. Her fear is its own gravity, pulling me tighter into it.

A shadow passes under the door, blocking the faint glow from the hall light. I see it clear as day—a shift in the light like someone crouched low, right on the other side.

I step back.

The scrape stops.

My ears strain for sound—anything.

But there’s nothing at all.

The air feels thicker, like I’m underwater.

I glance back at Easton. She’s shaking her head, slow, controlled, like she knows exactly what’s about to happen. Her eyes flick from me to the door, like she’s silently begging me—don’t move, don’t move, don’t move.

Another knock comes.

Soft this time.

Not the pounding from before.

Three taps.

Slow and patient, like whoever’s out there has all the time in the world.

I feel the sweat drip down the back of my neck. It’s cold, but I’m burning up. The knock comes again—just as soft, just as slow. I press my back against the wall, gun raised, barrel aimed at the door. My thumb rests on the safety. I flick it off, and the click feels too loud. I squeeze the grip like it’s the only thing tethering me to the ground.

A voice comes from the other side of the door.

Low.

Whispery.

“I know you’re in there. Just want to talk.”

The voice is calm—like he’s smiling while he says it. My chest tightens so hard I can barely breathe. The way he says it—it’s not a request. It’s a statement, like he already knows how this is going to end.

I want to shout something back. Tell him to leave. Tell him I’m armed.

But the words stick in my throat.

My mind is spinning too fast.

My whole body is screaming—don’t say a word.

I glance at Easton again. She’s curled tighter into the closet, eyes locked on me. Her mouth is pressed into a thin line, so tight her lips are white. Her face says everything I’m feeling—don’t move.

The voice doesn’t come again.

I stare at the peephole, every muscle burning from how tense I am. My arms feel like lead, but I don’t lower the gun.

Minutes pass.

Five, maybe ten.

Long enough that my hands start to cramp.

The silence is suffocating—like the world outside stopped moving.

Then finally—

Footsteps.

Slow.

Heavy.

They move away from the door. Not rushed. Just… leaving. Like it was never a big deal to begin with.

My breath comes out in one long, shaky gasp. I don’t realize I’ve been holding it until I almost choke.

I wait.

I wait longer than I probably need to.

I’m still pressed against the wall, every part of me buzzing with leftover adrenaline. My hands numb from how hard I’ve been gripping the gun. I’m listening so hard it’s like my ears have their own heartbeat.

The only sound is my breathing—too fast and too shallow.

Easton stares at me from the crack in the closet door. She’s still shaking her head, slow and steady.

It’s not over.

I’m about to say something—maybe ask if she’s okay, maybe tell her it’s fine—but then I see her eyes shift.

They’re not looking at me anymore.

They’re looking past me.

Her face goes pale, like all the blood just drained out of it.

I’ve seen people scared before—but this… this is something else.

My whole body turns ice cold.

I’m afraid to move.

Afraid to turn around.

But I have to.

I twist my head slowly, inch by inch, every nerve screaming at me to stop.

The hallway leading to the bedroom is right behind me. It’s dark, except for the faint glow from the TV. The shadows are long and deep, and at first I think that’s all I’m seeing—just shadows, just the play of light on the walls.

But then I see it.

A shape.

Right there at the edge of the hallway.

Half hidden in shadow.

Tall—too tall.

Shoulders too broad.

The outline of a head, tilted just slightly like he’s looking at me.

He’s not moving.

But I know he’s there.

The shadows don’t breathe like that.

The shadows don’t have the shape of hands.

My heart seizes in my chest. I’m frozen. Like if I don’t move, he’ll go away.

But he’s not going away.

He’s just standing there.

His head tilting a little more, like he’s curious. Like he’s waiting to see what I’ll do.

The shape in the hall shifts.

I step forward—my knees lock—and every instinct in me is screaming to run. But I’d have to turn my back to do that.

I’m not turning my back.

I’m not.

Another step.

I see his foot now.

A boot.

Scuffed. Dirty.

The edge of it just barely in the light from the TV.

“I’m armed,” I say.

My voice cracks. I’m trying to sound strong, but it’s not working.

He just stands there.

That same tilt to his head, like he’s weighing his options.

My heart’s slamming against my ribs. I’m sure he can hear it. I’m sure he can hear everything.

He remains still. Watching me.

He doesn’t move.

Isn’t saying a word.

Then he steps forward.

Just one step.

But it’s enough.

The light from the screen hits his face—and for a split second, I see it clearly.

Pale white, like he’s drained of blood.

Huge, sharp teeth.

His eyes are fixed on me like he’s close to solving a riddle. His mouth hangs slightly open, like he almost spoke but changed his mind.

He’s calm.

That’s the part that makes it worse.

Calmer than he should be.

Suddenly—there’s a knock behind me.

Three soft taps on the front door.

Slow.

Deliberate.

I glance at it—just a second—and when I look back…

The hallway is empty.

He’s gone.

My hands won’t stop shaking. I’m barely holding on to the gun now.

In the closet, Easton is crouched low, her hands in her hair, hiding her face. When our eyes meet, she’s already shaking her head. Over and over.

Another knock.

Same rhythm.

Three soft taps.

Then her voice—barely more than a breath—reaches me from the dark.

She’s staring at me, eyes huge, glassy, accusing.

The words sink into me like ice water:

""She warned me not to say anything.""

The knocking stops.

My breath catches.

I brace for footsteps—but none come.

I’m locked in place. A statue made of brittle bones and fraying nerves. Easton’s clutching the doorframe like it’s the only thing holding her together. Her eyes are wild, darting from me to the darkness behind me. She’s watching it too—watching something I’m too afraid to see.

There’s a shift.

The faintest creak of weight on the floorboards. The kind of sound a person makes when they’re trying to stay quiet.

It’s so close.

I squeeze the gun tighter. My finger hovers over the trigger, just barely brushing it.

I’m not sure I’d have the control to pull it clean—not with my hands shaking like this.

I’m running through every option I have. Every way this could go.

If I turn—I’m dead.

If I shoot blind—I’m probably worse than dead.

A shift in the floor behind me.

A sudden rush of movement.

My body moves before my brain catches up.

I drop low, twisting to the side, one arm raised, gun already swinging toward him.

I’m not thinking.

I’m just reacting.

He’s fast.

Too fast.

A blur of shadow and motion.

I see a flash of his face—eyes dark and sharp, mouth set in something that’s not quite a smile.

His hand—I see it reaching for me, fingers hooked like claws.

I don’t hesitate.

I’ve got one shot.

One chance.

I fire.

The gunshot explodes in the small space—deafening and sharp. 

The flash of light is blinding, searing the image of him into my eyes for half a second. 

That face—so close to mine.

Too close.

My vision’s shot—too much flash, too much fear.

As my eyes adjust, I see him sprawled on the floor, one arm stretched toward me, fingers just barely reaching.

His face is turned away.

Easton’s still in the closet, staring at me—her face pale as a ghost. 

She’s not shaking her head anymore.

She’s just staring.

I’m breathing hard, the gun still raised, barrel aimed right at him. 

I’m not moving. Not until I’m sure.

Not until I’m certain he’s not getting up.

Another creak.

But it’s not from him.

It’s from the front door.

Three slow knocks.

I’d swear it’s the same rhythm as before.

I’m done waiting.

Every muscle in my body protests as I force myself to move, feet dragging like I’m walking through water.

I’m at the door now, breath shallow. 

My hand grips the doorknob, slick with sweat, and I twist it slowly—no sudden moves.

The door creaks open.

An inch.

Then two.

Then all the way.

Nothing.

The street outside is empty.

No footsteps. 

No shadowy figure waiting in the glow of the streetlight.

I scan left, then right.

But there’s no one there. 

No sign that anyone had ever been there at all.

I shut the door.

Turn the lock. 

And brace my back against it.

My breath comes out in a rush, like I’ve been holding it for hours.

I glance back to the living room.

The floorboards are stained dark where he fell.

But he’s gone.

The spot where his body was sprawled is empty.

No outstretched arm.

No twisted face. 

No body.

I’m walking backward now, eyes locked on that spot, afraid to blink.

Afraid to look away.

I feel Easton’s presence behind me before I hear her move. 

Her footsteps are soft but deliberate.

When I turn, she’s already pulling on her jacket. 

Her eyes don’t meet mine.

She’s at the door before I can say anything, hand on the knob, body half turned—like she’s waiting for me to stop her.

“Don’t ever mention my name to anyone again,” she says, voice low, 

“or they’ll come for you.”

She opens the door, steps out, and closes it behind her.

That’s the last time I see her.

No texts.

No calls. 

Just gone.

Her number stops working.

I want to ask people—someone, anyone—if they’ve seen her.

But I don’t.

I’m too scared.

I don’t even say her name out loud anymore.

Not even in my own head.

Weeks pass.

I try to go back to normal. Whatever that means.

Then one day, I’m scanning through my phone.

I scroll past the usual screenshots, memes, dumb stuff from work—when I find a photo I don’t remember taking.

It’s me.

Sitting outside the coffee shop. Smiling at someone just out of frame. The timestamp is the day we met.

I almost swipe past it.

But then I see it.

In the reflection of the window behind me—

A dark figure.

Standing across the street.

A story of epic proportions,  but let's give it a coles note version.

  Before I was 17 I have had like 50 girlfriends.  Never had sex with any of them, lots of fooling around but no piv.   But life is funny.  I went to a concert because M was going,  I dated M in grade 10 I think.  We stayed friends and as she dated other guys I would  be sad,  she is one of those people who I still love deeply, but she never wanted kids and I did but she's amazing and I seen her a couple times over the years and I still think she is amazing.

  So at the concert watching her make out with a guy I made a joke I would go out in the crowd and come back with a girl.  A is and always be beautiful godess that is dumb as the day is long.  But she caught my eye, and she had a boyfriend so her friend I thought actually her sister was very beautiful, but more a mother type.  We made out and stuff when I got home we talked to the wee hours of the morning.  I was smitten, we dated for years and planned a fantasy life.   But I have problems, we all do.  L was and is my soul mate I thought.

  We were high school sweethearts.  Well at 20, we moved in together it was awesome.  I worked retail, she at a coffee shop.  We smoked weed and the place was a mess.  I had a stack of pizza boxes to the ceiling.  A buddy spat on the floor and I couldn't blame him.  Well I like to write, it always helps me get my feelings out.  I may have written in a journal how her our friend was so beautiful.  How I wanted her sister.  I even think someone caught me fucking my self with a dildo.  I  am bi, but that's a different story.  We had crippling debt,  only thousands but in your 20s crippling.  I was selling weed after quitting my job.  And the worst part was she was working 2 jobs to pay the bills.  I hate myself for this...... we broke up.  We were supposed to move but after the break up she and another previous ex girlfriend asked me to keep my name on the lease but I couldn't handle it, i told her to have a good life .  I cant cry my heart out beside another girl.  I once said to her cousin if I don't marry her after 4 years it will never happen.  I believe that everyone out there.

  Her parents are well off, upper working class, and paid off our debt.  Even though I didn't go on a trip to Mexico with them, I said if they could remove the same as the half a trip they were going to pay for earlier that year.  Than all my friends go out to her cottage with out telling me.   But it was obvious to me.  She had a new boyfriend.  This helped my depression alot.  I have hated most of my friends since.  I almost committed suicide, but thought one day we might get back together.

  I hitchhiked across Canada, I cried myself to sleep every night holding her picture.  The picture she wanted back because she is so beautiful in it. She glows.  I had to put it in a box with all my journals of those years.  I cry just thinking of her in that picture.  I came back east resumed life I guess. 

  4 or 5 years later I met a coworker A same name.  18 so hot.  I loved her more than she did me and I still love her to but.....
After all this M came back we made out it was magical. 
Than L asked me to hang out but I'm an ass, and always wanted her to tell me she misses me first, so I kept my feelings pent up.  This is the last time I saw L.  I stayed alone dreaming of her creeping her on Facebook.  Driving by her house.  

Well she got married to an asshole I knew from high-school.  She went to the parry with my friends, where they met.  They had 2 kids, I want to kill myself more they were both boys.  I still couldn't move on.

Than 11 years ago I met C she asked me out, and after the 5 6 previous girls that asked me out I denied made me sad that at least I could have felt some pleasure from their sweet imbrace.  So I accepted Cs advances, I was 31 she was 39.

C has a son, he was 7, only child single mother.   Dad out of the picture.  I was raised by a single mother, i have never met my dad.  We were the perfect family for a year or 2.  She can't have kids anymore, but I was ok with it hoping I'd win the lottery and impregnate her and we would marry.  Or I would save money and we would get invetro.  But as my mom says she has champagne tastes on beer budget.  We never made enough, over a hundred thousand house hold income.  I am lazy and aggressive, passionate and as my mom and C has said has the patience of a Saint.  So tension built in our relationship.  I resent that she sterilized herself.

Mean while A has a  kid.  L gets a divorce.  Than remarried a guy who already married and had 2 kids with one of my high school exs they have a kid together.

Back to me and C.  I have never clicked sexually and spiritually like I have with C, she agrees.  But the hottest fires burn short.  And even though I had more money now.  She quit her job making half the amount.  She gambled half her pension.  She would have met minimum retirement age in 4 years from now.  She abused me physically but, I got her to hurt herself by dodging.  So last year I heard her on the phone with a dude was like wtf, she was like oh sorry.....but I we talked she promised nothing happened.  I kind of believe her, but like I believed the girl in the rape trail I was the juror in.  Again another story... they wanted and seeked the attention.  She also said it is a mans fault a woman cheats, its normally inattent.  So she has anxiety sometimes, she takes depression pills, clumsy, forgetful, sometimes cruel.  I promised and was more attentive.  Again it was my hoarding like ALL my family. I am messy.  I can be alot to deal with....believe me so is she but we were and are Ying and yang sexual and through traits.  I agree I need a push to do stuff but it is a guy thing.  So I herd her on the phone giggling and I heard 3 words twice I love you.  I knew she was cheating, I knew she could let go of me.  I asked her so many times I will leave if she asked, just don't cheat, I believe all three of my relationships in the last 42 years have cheated on me.  I am childless.  Which recently I found out would have bequeathed me millions in land and property.  

  Than I find out L is divorced.  I see and both As on tinder.
  I moved in with my mom,  I am depressed and want something i went to a gay bathhouse,  sucked off some dudes. I made out with a dude, it grossed me out.  C needs money,  the new guy makes 100 g, they break up.  C wants my d 2 or 3 days later.   I tell her everything you have read and more gets cold feet, I booked a doctor's appointment next week.  So today she wanted money, I know she got money from him so they are together.  Again if that they actually broke up.  I have only gotten a boner today for the first time in weeks thinking of if she wasn't with him we would get dirty again.  She let me buy our cats food.  I would buy her groceries too.  But I'm broke till midnight.  I crave her crazy kinky shit.  I feel closer to her than ever.  I want babies.  I am sad.  I miss L alot, I miss C and her son my best friend for 11 years.  I want to fuck every woman, every way.  Sometimes femme men.  I have slept with 3 women and 0 dudes.  I have been having Ed.  And I'm on the verge of mental collapse.

The initial setup was the only negative - there is no QR code, you have to manually create the eSIM and copy/paste the codes into your phone. Not a big deal but a little annoying and potentially confusing for less tech-savvy people.

After this, the activation failed - my phone sat on ""Activating"" for about two hours, then came up with a failed error message. However, the eSIM said it was ""on"", so I didn't panic. A quick Internet search led me to the page of another eSIM provider, which said an activation error is quite common, and your eSIM is fine.

Note that the JJ eSIM website doesn't have this point listed anywhere in the FAQ or support pages. And it wasn't just my phone - I was travelling from the UK and activated a day before leaving. I was meeting a friend travelling from the US and she did the same, and also got the activation failed message. We were both using iPhone 14s.

But as soon as I landed in Japan, the eSIM worked. It connected instantly with the local service (and I mean instantly) and was blazingly fast - way faster than my home service in the UK. Not only that, it was reliable and coverage was incredible. I was in the deepest part of the Enoshima sea caves and still had full signal and was posting to Instagram.

I lost signal only once in a 12-day trip, and weirdly that was in a tiny corridor leading to the toilets in a Komeda's Coffee, so hardly an issue.

So for anyone trying to decide on an eSIM for their Japan trip, I would recommend JJ eSIM without hesitation. Initial setup is not perfect, but the service was SO good, I was super pleased, as was my travelling companion.

My friends, “L” (16f), ”V” (15f), and “A” (15f) really dislike alterhuman/furries. Which is exactly why I’ve been holding back on telling them for the past three years. I’ve known both L and V since kindergarten, and I’ve known A for three years. We’re all really close and we hang out a lot. Well one day, I was getting coffee with V and A. I was wearing a tail that I have (which I’ve done many times before without them noticing). We went up to order, and I heard A say something to V and then she walked up to me saying, “What’s on your pants, \[my name\]?” in a grossed out way. I told her what it was and she started freaking out, calling me disgusting and awful. 

She walked off with V and then once I’d bought our drinks we sat down at a table. They started asking me a bunch of questions, which is when I told them I’m a therian. They both freaked out and were very rude about it, saying how they wouldn’t have been friends with me if they’d known and why didn’t I tell them sooner. I explained that their very reaction was why, but they kept calling me bad words. 

Now, here’s where I might be the AH. They were saying how they didn’t want to be friends with a freak, so I told them that I didn’t want friends who would berate and make fun of me. They got all offended like they weren’t already planning on getting rid of our friendship. I left and drove home because I was sick of being yelled at by the people I was hoping would accept me. 

Apparently one of them had told L, who started sending me angry messages. I told them all that I didn’t want to talk to them if all they were going to do was say how disgusting I was. They’re angry and won’t speak to me, which I guess  is what I wanted. I thought that was the right thing to say at the time, but I don’t know.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications.

Would it be Ginebra 50%, San Miguel 15%, Magnolia 15%, TNT 10% and 10% others? 
Or would it be closer to 80% Ginebra and 20% other teams?

He told me he didn't like onions which sucked for his culture of food. He talked about his family's spice mix and his love for pizza. We both said how we loved pineapple on pizza and I now like this man even more. I met a new guy at the gym who is a friend of long hair gym bro.

SBIST was having two people discuss how delicious my muffins were. Same school guy came up to me to tell me how great it was and soccer bro then started talking to him saying how he got one as well. Them discussing how good they were was enough to make my day. I love going to the gym but things like that make it even better. I like baking treats for others like I discussed yesterday but them coming together like that was unexpected and very welcomed. Now all I have to do is let them try some of my future projects. 

Tomorrow the plan is to wake up and get some stuff done. Then I want to actually relax and play some video games for myself. After finishing up playing those I want to go to the gym for core day then come home and eat my prepped dinner. It should be a nice and relaxing day for myself. I'll get some chores done here and there. I'll also prepare to get ready to go to my sister's house for the weekend. I can't wait for this weekend and to see Star Wars in theaters. It will be a great rest of my week. Thank you my conjurers of the easy breezy lemon squeeze kind of days. You make it so the exciting days are even crazier to exist.

As promised since we hit 100 LIKES I posted more photos.

It truly is a really nice resort and the food is bomb! Very expensive but really delicious and good! Seafood, crab legs, sushi, and they have their own Benihana style restaurant as well! 

This resort has the best coffee! So if you do not want to drop a few hundred on a meal then definitely get a coffee its super fresh and potent as they ground their own beans on site like minutes before it gets to your lips! 

As you can see my room we sprung for the pimp suite because I like to soak in the tub. Squid Games season 2 just dropped at midnight so I was sitting in that tub and binge watching Squid Games season 2 and sat in that tub till like 5AM LOL FACE PALM! The suite was like $500 a night but can you really put a price on living it up SBTB Royalty style? Like the real life Princess Christina slumming it up with AC for the weekend? 

I'm being 200% honest and saying this was a bucket list goal for me forever and when we finally were able to go I felt like I accomplished something I waited my whole life for!

There's also a ton of PINK FLAMINGOS all around the water front area. I dont know how they got them to stay there but yeah it was really something else to see like 50 PINK FLAMINGOS just chilling in front of the hotel by the water. 

Thanks guys! I hope you too can fulfill your SBTB Mecca journey as well!

1k7bigx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1k7bigx/the_wednesday_guy/,The Wednesday guy,"I (39, female) haven't been in a serious relationship for over ten years. I've dated, but nothing ever progressed beyond the second date. Relationships were never easy for me since I have a hard time opening up. Last year, I met a guy on a dating app—let's call him ""Wednesday Guy"" (I’ll explain why later). He asked to meet up for dinner and drinks on a Wednesday. Everything seemed cool, he paid for dinner, and he appeared to be someone looking for a relationship. He even kissed me, which caught me off guard. I was pretty excited and started to think he might be ""the one."" After that, we exchanged a few text messages. As the weekend approached, I expected him to ask me out again, but he didn’t. I thought that was fine. The following week, he asked to hang out... on Wednesday. I didn't think much about the repeated Wednesday pattern and agreed without questioning it because he has a busy job running his own business. Three weeks went by, and we moved to the next level by sleeping together. For me, if you start sleeping with someone, you would assume that things are a little more serious, right? After a month, I took it upon myself to ask if he wanted to hang out on a Saturday. He said no because he was going to visit his family out of town. I wished him a safe drive but wondered why he couldn't see me for a bit after he got off work before he left.

Shortly after, I developed a rash, and an urgent care doctor told me it was scabies. It turned out it wasn't and I told Wednesday guy which he seemed annoyed. We didn't see each other for two weeks (or 2 wednesdays) while my rash healed, but we continued to text. After speaking with my PCP, she confirmed it wasn't scabies but rather a fungal infection from my nail salon (This part is important).

Fast forward three months, and we had only hung out on Wednesdays, I guess we were still in the dating phase. I forgot to mention that the reason I call him the ""Wednesday guy"" is because I told my friends about him, and they refer to him that way since we only met up on Wednesdays. My other friends call him Sandwich guy since that's all WE ate while dating. I prefer to call him Wednesday. 

On my birthday, I ended our relationship due to a mixture of what he said and built-up frustration. His response, Okay. Two weeks went by with no contact when Wednesday texted me to try again. The reason I met up with him is that I felt it was my fault for not speaking up what I want in a relationship. We finally hung out on a Saturday, but it was late in the afternoon, close to dinner time, and I told him I was hungry. He then basically kicked me out of his house. It was only 6 PM, and I had hoped we would spend some more time later that evening. As I was walking to my car, he said, ""Maybe I'll see you Sunday."" However, I didn’t hear from him on Sunday. I was upset and disappointed, so I texted him, saying it wasn't working out. His response was simply, ""Okay."" Three months later, who texted me? Yep, the Wednesday guy. Yes, I did meet up with him and confronted him about how selfish he had been and how he treated me. He gave me the excuse that he wasn't ready for a relationship, but now he is. He claimed he was hurt in the past and that’s why he acted the way he did and I was ""rushing"" him into a relationship. I didn’t understand because all I asked for was to hang out other than on Wednesday. I asked him if he was seeing someone else while we were together. He admitted he was, but he only had coffee with someone. His BS reason... he thought i was sleeping around with other people thought that's how i got that rash.  Turns out he NEVER deleted his dating app and was actively seeking other matches. It's funny; I had told my mom and my married guy friends about the situation, and they all believed he was seeing someone else. I didn't believe it because he didn’t seem like that type, and I'm a jealous person, so it never crossed my mind. I did end up taking him back again. Fast forward three weeks. I thought the past was behind us, and I made it clear what I wanted in this relationship... until Thanksgiving came and was just two days away. I asked him if I was going to see him later since he was traveling back to see family and it would be two weeks before I saw him again. His response made me see red; he said he would rather work out. I was livid. After everything we had gone through and him claiming he put in effort, we got into a fight, and I ended it. He didn’t take me seriously, even after I avoided his text messages for a week. When I finally responded to him, he acted like nothing happened and that I was in the wrong. I later found out he was talking to someone just two days after I ended it (that’s another long story about how I found out). I reached out to this girl, and she told me they matched on a dating app. I explained my situation to her, and she said she didn't want to talk to him. I confronted him, and he, of course, denied it at first. I sent him the screenshots, and he finally admitted it. I know there's more he’s not telling me. This back-and-forth texting went on for a month. Yes, I gave in and took him back. I truly felt he was trying this time and was sorry.

So, three weeks passed, which isn't that long. I asked him if he wanted to go with me to look for a birthday gift for my mom. He said yes, so I picked him up. On the way, I told him about my friend’s situation with her boyfriend when he interrupted with a rude opinion about her, even though he’d never met her. I respectfully corrected him, but he seemed heated, so I changed the subject. He stayed quiet during the car ride and gave me the cold shoulder at the store. After paying, I couldn’t find him. I called and texted him several times, but he didn’t respond. Realizing he left me, I texted that I was heading home. I felt more disappointed than angry. He pursued me and made me believe he wanted a relationship. For those wondering why I stayed and avoid the red flags... I know all relationships are challenging; I usually give up, but I wanted to try this time. Unfortunately, I guess I tried with the wrong person. The next day, he sent me a message saying that I was rude and dismissive to him, and he didn't want to be with someone like that. I didn't respond. Two and a half months passed by, and I got a text from Wednesday guy... His message was, ""Did you date a guy named Michael (not the real name)?"" He didn't say hello, how are you, or sorry I abandoned you at the store. 

I didn't respond but wondering if I should with a petty response? If yes, what should i say??

BTW, I haven't dated anyone after him or know a guy name Michael.",1,1745552490.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Ever find yourself stuck in a doom scroll cycle on your phone and wonder, *“Where did my day go?”* Trust me, you’re not alone. Ever since smartphones became mini-universes in our pockets, maintaining focus has felt like trying to herd cats, right? 🌟 But what if I told you that cutting the digital noise could bring back some sanity and precious time to your life?

Cue digital minimalism: the art of simplifying your virtual world to maximize your real one. Sounds fancy, but think of it as decluttering your digital space so you can focus on what truly sets your soul on fire.

**Let’s dive into some easy steps to get you started:**

1. **Audit Your Apps:** Take a stroll through your phone and ask, “Do I really need *five* different news apps?” If you haven’t used it in two weeks, it's time to go Marie Kondo on it! Does it spark joy? No? *Delete.*

2. **Notifications? Non, Merci!:** Are those endless pings like a ringtone from Hades? Turn off notifications for all non-essential apps. Your group chat can wait; enjoy your coffee first. ☕

3. **Time Blocks for Social Media:** Love seeing what your friend from college had for brunch, but not enough to lose sleep over it? Set specific times of the day for social media. Trust me, the world will keep on spinning if you miss a meme or two.

4. **Substitute, Don’t Eliminate:** Instead of mindlessly scrolling, try consuming content that fuels you! Podcasts, e-books, or even a good old-fashioned walk can be the perfect guilt-free subs. What about a podcast that’s been sitting in your “to listen” list forever?

Now, I'm not suggesting you go full hermit mode and live in the woods (though, tempting after a week of Zoom meetings). It's about being intentional with the digital choices we make. The goal is to carve out space for what genuinely matters—because let’s face it, nobody’s ever looked back and thought, ""Wow, I wish I'd spent more time on Twitter.""

*Have you tried any of these tips, or maybe you've got some of your own? How’s your digital detox journey going?* I’m curious—what unexpected joys have you discovered in reclaiming your screen time? So grab a cup of tea, unplug for a bit, and let’s chat about making digital minimalism work for us!

Peace, focus, and growth to all,
*[Your Name]*

1k7bfkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1k7bfkj/margins/,Margins,"I never meant to stay.  
The body was buried under a sycamore,  
half-lost to roots and time.  
They put flowers on me once—  
then forgot.  

But I lingered. Not out of rage.  
Not even love.  
Curiosity, maybe.  
Some strange itch that death  
couldn't scratch.

Years passed.  
Cities sprouted like weeds,  
louder and lonelier.  
The wind used to whisper  
between wooden shutters—  
now it screams  
through glass towers  
and traffic veins.  

The house I once haunted  
became a coffee shop,  
then a startup hub  
with ping pong and plant walls.  
People came in with eyes  
glued to glowing rectangles,  
talking to no one,  
laughing at nothing.  
I watched them,  
like a moth staring at a bonfire  
through a window.

And one day—  
there it was.  
A pen.  
Black ink, left on a desk  
next to an oat milk latte  
and a forgotten journal.  
The hand moved on instinct.  
Memory in bone,  
even if the bone was ash.  

The first line trembled:  
*""I remember when silence meant something.""*  

Words poured out.  
Not poetry, not prophecy—  
just fragments.  
Flashes.  
A child's giggle behind curtains.  
The way rain sounds  
on an old tin roof.  
A mother humming  
while peeling apples.  

But now…  
People record moments  
to remember them later  
and forget them now.  
Grief is curated  
in Instagram captions,  
and love—  
love is swiped left or right,  
packaged in profiles,  
boxed by algorithms  
that never felt heartbreak.  

I see you.  
All of you.  
Drowning in noise,  
choking on choices,  
terrified of stillness.  
Your eyes flicker  
like candlelight  
in a wind tunnel.  

And me?  
I'm just a whisper,

There even seems to be a community of people looking for this specific song, so whoever finds it will make a lot of people’s day :).

The song is playing during the “freak party” scene at Coney Island when Detective Rollins and Finn walk in. The song is a slow grungy kind of song, super moody. 

If anyone can solve it I’ll buy you a coffee :). Or if you wanna make an AI version of it from the song if anyone knows how lol. Anyway. Thanks! ",1,1745552061.0,whatsongisthis,0,1.0,False

Long story short, I finally caught a recording of 235 BPM that lasted a couple minutes after exercising on the treadmill. Showed it to my EP and he pretty much wanted to do an ablation no questions asked. The diagnosis was Atrial Tachycardia, which was unexpected as we thought it was going to be AVNRT or WPW. 

Problem is, I failed to mention that I drank STOK Cold Brew Coffee before going to the gym and having the episode. It's about 170 mg of caffeine for a serving and I am concerned that I rushed into the procedure without addressing an obvious cause. I also had several episodes in 2022 and I am almost positive I had not drank caffeine or alcohol for all of them.

 I've been having more heart palpitations now than before the procedure and it has been affecting me mentally. No obvious SVT during exercise so far though, so I still have faith I did something positive. I'm really annoyed at myself for drinking caffeine that day as it just adds to my uncertainty. Can an ablation do more harm than good by damaging too much healthy heart tissue if SVT is not happening that often? ",1,1745552005.0,SVTHeart,0,1.0,False

We have great chats and have a good time whenever we hang out, we have been pretty close since kids but lately I feel like I’m being gaslighted by her… we used to send each other messages all the time but now doesn’t reply back until nearly a month and it’s usually not about what we were talking about, she basically disregards the previous conversation and starts a new one by asking how I am and how I’ve been and that she wants to get together for some coffee because she has a lot to talk to me about. I reply and again a month goes by and she then sends another random message asking how I am and that we should hang out, this has happened about 3 times since the start of the year. I also recently found out by other friends that she got a new job which she has not told me about which I find weird because we tell each other everything, at least I thought we did and a new job is something weird to keep secret from someone you considered to be close to right? Anyway, I’ve been feeling like she only reaches out when she has something going on in her life that she wants to talk about because she doesn’t have anyone else to talk to, I almost feel used in a way. She sent a fourth message now a couple days ago again asking how I am, she wants to get coffee soon because she has so much going on and wants to talk to me about it (usually is about a guy she’s talking to). I feel weird because she doesn’t respond to what I sent her, makes me feel unheard or unimportant and the fact that she’s doesn’t bother to send a message back until a month later is rude in my opinion. I don’t believe that out of a whole month she can’t take a minute or two to reply back to me?

I just have to spread the love. More games need to be like this. I’ve only played around 3 hours, but boy, that's all it took to realize this is, unironically, **ABSOLUTE CINEMA**.

I heard the developers previously worked under Ubisoft... well well well, look what happens when you escape the corporate shithole: you make art. What does that tell you?

Seriously, recommend this game to everyone. Grab a fucking megaphone, yell it from rooftops, whisper it to strangers in coffee shops (not in a creepy way), whatever it takes. Just get people to buy this game. And of course buy it yourself if you haven't already, what are you stupid?

It slaps from the very first frame, and it keeps slapping.

The visuals - Gorgeous. It's directed like an artsy Oscar nominated movie, and I say that in the best way possible.

The soundtrack - Like chocolate milk but for my ears.

The storytelling - Respects your intelligence. 

The characters - Layered and interesting.

The voice acting - Chef’s kiss, fucking MUAA! especially when playing in French with English subtitles (feels like the intended vibe, and it just sounds romantic and sexy).

Look, I know this isn’t a ""review"". It’s more like poetic ass-worship. I'm not being a critic here I'm just eating ass. But if a game’s ass is this fine, I can eat it for days. I’m still in there. Typing this from the inside. Buy it.",14,1745551625.0,JRPG,69,0.55,False

The blankets scratched against my skin, too clean, too stiff. I hadn’t felt anything this sterile in months, and it made my teeth itch. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like a warning I couldn’t decipher. I should’ve felt safe. I didn’t.

Officer Ewing sat beside the bed, flipping through a notepad. His pen clicked every few seconds, scribbling something I couldn’t see. He hadn’t said much since I woke up—just asked the basics. What I remembered again. If I wanted to go home.

“No,” I said, before he even finished the sentence. My throat was dry, my voice rough around the edges, but I meant it. “I’m not going back there.”

He paused his writing and looked up at me. “You sure? You’ve been through a lot. Sometimes familiarity—”

“He knows where I live,” I interrupted. “He helped build my house. He—he watched me long before this. I don’t know how long, but I’m not going back there.”

Ewing nodded slowly, like he understood, but I wasn’t convinced anyone really could.
“I’ll stay somewhere else. Just… not there.”

“All right,” he said after a moment. “We can set you up in a hotel in the next town over, for now. We’ll have someone from the department grab any personal items you need from your home.”

I hesitated. I didn’t even know what I needed anymore. Everything from before felt like it belonged to someone else.

“Can you get me a notepad?” I asked. “I’ll make a list.”

He left the room without another word, and when he came back, he handed me a cheap spiral notebook and a pen. I stared at the blank page for a long time before I finally wrote:
	•	My camera
	•	The memory cards in the desk drawer
	•	The couple hoodies in the hallway closet and sweatpants from my dresser 
	•	Toothbrush and face wash
	•	My laptop
	•	A photo of parents, any photo
	•	My passport
	•	my gun in the safe - code (6793)

I stared at the list, unsure if anything on it still mattered, but it was all I could think of. My hands were trembling when I gave it to him.

“I’ll make sure someone gets this today,” he said, his eyes scanning the page. “Anything else?”

I wanted to say peace. Safety. Answers.
Instead, I shook my head.

They wheeled me out of the hospital first thing in the morning. The air was soggy and wet. The sky dull and void of color. Like the world had every intention of reflecting what had happened.

The town they took me to was some small place just east of the county line. The kind of town people passed through on their way to somewhere else. New green leaves clung to the trees, trembling in the stormy wing. Daffodils lined the sidewalks like tiny sentries, bold and yellow against the cracked pavement. You could see the mountains  peaking atop the buildings like little party hats. The tops of them dipped in white glitter and green sashes. The beauty of them a marvel of its own. 


Officer Ewing drove in silence. His partner followed behind us in a separate car. At one point, he asked if I was hungry, and I just shook my head. A minute later, I changed my mind.

“I would really love a burger and milkshake actually. Can’t remember the last time I had that.” I said managing a small smile. 

He glanced at me, his expression unreadable. “There’s a place next to the hotel. Old diner. Locals swear by it.”

I nodded, hugging my coat tighter around me. The fabric still smelled faintly of smoke and earth, and something else I didn’t want to name.

We pulled into the gravel lot ten minutes later. The diner looked like it had been carved out of the 1950s and left untouched—chrome trim, faded red booths visible through the window, and a flickering sign that said Lou’s. I couldn’t tell if it was meant to be endearing or just depressing.

Inside, the warmth hit me like a wave. Bacon grease and syrup, burnt coffee, and something sweet baking in the back. I slid into a booth near the window while Ewing stood at the counter placing our order. I caught the waitress glancing over at me, her eyes catching on the bandages, the stiffness in how I sat. Her face softened in that way people do when they think something awful’s happened, and they don’t know what to say.

Ewing came back with two glasses of water and a plastic number card. “They’ll bring it out,” he said, settling across from me. He didn’t ask any more questions. Just sat there with his hands folded, glancing around the room like he was trying to memorize it.

“I haven’t been here before,” I said quietly.

He nodded. “Small town. Lot of history, if you care about that sort of thing. Quiet. Usually.”

I looked out the window at the empty street. Just damp sidewalks, the skeletons of trees slowly waking up after a long, brutal winter. I couldn’t tell if it was peaceful or dreadful.

Maybe both.


The food came fast. A paper-lined basket of fries steaming in the air between us, the burger heavy in my hands, its grease already soaking through the napkin. The milkshake was in one of those metal cups, still frosty on the outside. Vanilla, thick enough to bend the straw.

I didn’t realize how hungry I was until the first bite. My jaw ached when I chewed, like my body wasn’t used to doing normal things anymore. But I kept going. I needed this—something solid, something hot, something that tasted like home, even if it wasn’t mine.

Ewing watched me for a minute, then picked up his own burger and started eating too. We didn’t say much. Just the occasional comment about the food. How the fries were perfect. How the burger was almost too greasy, but in a good way.

When I dipped a fry into the milkshake, he raised an eyebrow. I shrugged.

“Don’t knock it till you try it,” I said, voice still a little hoarse from crying earlier.

He smiled—barely—and took a sip of his coffee instead. “I’ll take your word for it.”

The silence after that wasn’t uncomfortable. It just… was. Like we were both pretending to be two people grabbing lunch on a quiet spring day in a quiet little town. Nothing more.

But I could feel it behind my ribs—that buzz of wrongness. The kind that doesn’t scream. The kind that just lingers, waiting for you to notice it.

When I was full, I pushed the rest of my fries away and leaned back in the booth. My stomach was settled, but my head felt like it had been put through a blender.

“Thank you,” I said softly. “For this. For not… rushing me.”

Ewing nodded. “You’ve been through hell. You don’t need to explain anything.”

He said it so simply, like it was just a fact. Not pity. Not performance.

Hell. He hit it right on the money.


The hotel looked like it hadn’t changed in decades. One of those aging roadside places built before GPS existed, with peeling green paint and a crooked neon sign that blinked VACANCY like a nervous tick. Two floors, all exterior entrances, and a front office that smelled like old coffee and plastic plants.

The clerk barely looked up when I walked in. I guess I didn’t look like someone who wanted small talk. He handed over a key—an actual metal key, not a card—and pointed down the row of rooms with a nicotine-stained finger.

Room 208 was on the second floor, halfway down the balcony. I climbed the stairs slowly, every step pulsing in my bad leg. The railing wobbled when I grabbed it, like it was barely holding on.

The door stuck before it opened, dragging across the frame like it hadn’t been used in months. Inside, the air was stale, tinged with cleaning product and something older—mildew, maybe, or the ghost of someone’s cigarette habit. The curtains were yellowed, the bedspread scratchy-looking with a floral pattern that might’ve once been cheerful.

It was exactly the kind of place that didn’t ask questions. Just offered you a bed and walls that kept things in or out, depending on what you needed.

I dropped my jacket on the single chair in the corner and locked the door behind me. The bathroom light flickered when I flipped the switch, humming overhead. I avoided the mirror, even though I could feel it waiting for me.

There was a TV bolted to the dresser. A Bible in the drawer. A couple burn marks on the carpet.

I sat on the edge of the bed and took a breath so deep it shook. It didn’t feel real. Not the room, not the drive here, not the fact that I was free—if that’s what this was. Everything felt too quiet. Too still. Like the world was holding its breath and hadn’t decided if it was going to exhale or scream.

Officer Ewing found my phone at Sam’s house. I didn’t realize I haven’t had it since the hike. This whole time I really have had no track of time.

My phone was charging, but I hadn’t turned it on yet. I wasn’t ready to hear the voicemails. To see the news. To be reminded that the rest of the world had kept going while I was frozen in hell.


I lay back on the bed, not bothering to pull the covers up. The weight of food in my stomach was a comfort and a burden—proof that I was still here, still functioning.

The hum of the old heater in the corner was the only sound. That and the occasional pop of the settling building. I closed my eyes, but my mind kept flashing—too fast, too sharp. The basement. The stew. The way Carries eyes looked when she told me to go.

I reached for my phone, half to distract myself, half because some stubborn part of me wanted to feel connected to the world again. The screen lit up, blinding in the dim room. Ten voicemails. Dozens of messages. Missed calls. Most from unknown numbers. Some from names I hadn’t seen in what felt like years.

I didn’t open them. Not yet.

Instead, I opened the camera roll. It felt safer.

There were still photos from the hike. The last ones I’d taken before everything fell apart. Trees heavy with snow. Animal tracks. A distant shot of the mountains behind my house. 

Then I saw one I didn’t remember taking. A blurry image. Me, sleeping. My face half-buried in my bed. 

 scrolled faster, heart thudding.

There were ten of them. All taken from angles I couldn’t have managed myself.

I dropped the phone like it burned. It slid off the bed and hit the floor with a soft thud.

I don’t know how long I sat there, just staring at the carpet, the faded pattern twisting into a black void. 

Eventually, I laid back down. Not because I thought I could sleep—but because I didn’t know what else to do.

I didn’t sleep. Not really. I drifted in and out, jerking awake every time the heater clicked or the wind pushed too hard against the window. Each sound felt like a knock at the door, like footsteps in the hallway. I kept telling myself I was safe. I said it out loud once, just to hear it.

“I’m safe now.”

But the room didn’t answer.

By morning, the light bleeding in through the yellowed curtains was weak and sour. I got up and shuffled toward the bathroom, avoiding the mirror again. My skin felt too tight. My scalp itched from not washing my hair, but I didn’t care enough to fix it. Not yet.

There was a knock at the door around ten.

My heart jumped sideways, and I froze.

It came again—two short taps this time. Not forceful. Measured.

I crossed the room slowly and looked through the peephole.

Ewing.

I cracked the door just enough to see his face. “Hey.”

He held up a paper bag and a drink tray. “Didn’t think you’d be up for diner food two days in a row. I got the stuff from your house too.”

I opened the door wider, letting him in.

He set the bag on the desk and nodded toward the window. “You left your curtains open last night. Thought I’d check in.”

I blinked. “I did?”

He didn’t answer that. Just started unpacking the food—egg sandwich, apple, a bottle of orange juice.

“There’s a social worker coming by later,” he said gently. “Just to talk. No pressure. She’s good. You’ll like her.”

I didn’t respond. I picked at the sandwich and stared out the window.

Ewing stayed a few more minutes, then told me to call if I needed anything and left without asking more questions.

I took a long shower. Hot water that didn’t run out, steam that filled the bathroom until the mirror blurred into white. I stood there until my fingers pruned, until the water stopped feeling good and started to sting. 

I dried off slowly, careful with my leg. The bandages were fresh, but the ache underneath pulsed steady. Not the sharp, screaming pain from before—just a dull reminder. 

I slipped on a sweat outfit and some running shoes. I have to go out today. I have to socialize. 

The idea of leaving the room made my stomach twist. The streets outside were quiet. Peaceful. But he could be anywhere.

He helped build my house.

He knew where I lived.

I pressed my palms against my knees and tried to breathe through it. He doesn’t know I am here. And staying hidden in a hotel room wasn’t safety—it was just another kind of prison.

I grabbed my bag and tucked the room key in my pocket. 

The air outside was lukewarm, winter and spring were fighting. I kept my hood up and my head down, heart thudding with every step. 

The town was small enough that everything was walkable. A few blocks in each direction, a mix of old buildings with flaking paint and newer ones that tried to fit in. Most had big windows and handmade signs. A mural covered the side of one bakery—mountains and stars, wildflowers blooming across the bricks. Someone had painted a quote beneath it, something about rising from the ashes. I didn’t want to think too hard about that.

I grazed through a thrift shop tucked between a hardware store and a hair salon. The whole place smelled like mothballs and fabric softener, the floors a patchwork of old rugs. I ran my fingers across a faded flannel, then a cracked leather wallet, then a box of old postcards. Some were blank. Some had writing so small I had to squint. Most ended with Wish you were here.

I bought a used book of poetry and another sweater three sizes too big. The clerk rang me up without a word.

At the gas station, I grabbed a bottle of water, a pack of gum, and a bag of salt-and-vinegar chips. The cashier gave me the same look the waitress had—soft eyes, careful voice. I wasn’t sure if it was kindness or pity, but I didn’t want either.

Daffodils bobbed along the sidewalk like they were listening. I followed the street until I reached the library—an old brick building with ivy on the corners and wide wooden doors. Inside, it was cool and quiet.

I sat in a corner with a book I didn’t remember picking up. Something about true crime. I should’ve put it back, but I didn’t. I read three chapters before I realized my hand was shaking.

I left the book on the table and walked back to the hotel just as the clouds were starting to gather.

The light in my room was gold and slanted when I got in. That soft, sinking kind of light that makes everything look like a memory. I set the book and snacks on the table. Sat on the bed and stared at the ceiling that was covered in this god awful yellow wallpaper. 

For a minute, I almost believed I was okay.

Then I noticed the message light blinking on the hotel phone.

Just once. Not flashing. Just a slow, steady red dot.

stared at the light. One single message.

I didn’t move.

It could be anything. A wrong number. The front desk. Some kind of automated call. Nothing. Nothing at all.

But my chest felt too tight again, that familiar grip just beneath my ribs, and I knew better than to lie to myself. I knew the way dread moved.

I stood slowly, crossed the room, and picked up the receiver. The old hotel phone clicked in my hand. I punched the blinking button with my thumb and held my breath.

A pause. Then the message played.

Static.
Then, a low, grainy voice—warped like it had come through a bad radio.

“Melanie.”
Just my name.

Then silence.

I hung up so hard the plastic cracked. The sound startled me more than the voice had. I stared down at the phone like it might ring again, but it didn’t.

I checked the front desk number on the room card. Called.

“Hi, this is Melanie in 208,” I said, trying to keep my voice even. “Did anyone call for me today? Maybe leave a message?”

A pause. Typing. Then: “Doesn’t look like it. No one’s called your line since you checked in.”

I thanked them and hung up.

For a few minutes I sat perfectly still, every part of me buzzing like I’d touched a live wire. He couldn’t know I was here. There was no way.

I didn’t leave the room again that day.

I tried. Twice. Got as far as the door once, hand on the knob, listening to the wind rake across the balcony like fingernails. But I couldn’t make myself turn it. Couldn’t step outside knowing that voice might still be out there—close, or worse, already watching.

I double-checked the locks. Pulled the curtains tighter. Turned the TV on just to have sound in the room. Something that didn’t sound like him.

The phone didn’t ring again.

Eventually, I fell asleep on top of the covers, fully dressed, one shoe still on. And I dreamed of walking through a forest I didn’t recognize—trees the color of bruises, sky split with something red, like a gash in the world. I woke up gasping.",1,1745551588.0,u_Brotatochip411,0,1.0,False

The blankets scratched against my skin, too clean, too stiff. I hadn’t felt anything this sterile in months, and it made my teeth itch. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like a warning I couldn’t decipher. I should’ve felt safe. I didn’t.

Officer Ewing sat beside the bed, flipping through a notepad. His pen clicked every few seconds, scribbling something I couldn’t see. He hadn’t said much since I woke up—just asked the basics. What I remembered again. If I wanted to go home.

“No,” I said, before he even finished the sentence. My throat was dry, my voice rough around the edges, but I meant it. “I’m not going back there.”

He paused his writing and looked up at me. “You sure? You’ve been through a lot. Sometimes familiarity—”

“He knows where I live,” I interrupted. “He helped build my house. He—he watched me long before this. I don’t know how long, but I’m not going back there.”

Ewing nodded slowly, like he understood, but I wasn’t convinced anyone really could.
“I’ll stay somewhere else. Just… not there.”

“All right,” he said after a moment. “We can set you up in a hotel in the next town over, for now. We’ll have someone from the department grab any personal items you need from your home.”

I hesitated. I didn’t even know what I needed anymore. Everything from before felt like it belonged to someone else.

“Can you get me a notepad?” I asked. “I’ll make a list.”

He left the room without another word, and when he came back, he handed me a cheap spiral notebook and a pen. I stared at the blank page for a long time before I finally wrote:
	•	My camera
	•	The memory cards in the desk drawer
	•	The couple hoodies in the hallway closet and sweatpants from my dresser 
	•	Toothbrush and face wash
	•	My laptop
	•	A photo of parents, any photo
	•	My passport
	•	my gun in the safe - code (6793)

I stared at the list, unsure if anything on it still mattered, but it was all I could think of. My hands were trembling when I gave it to him.

“I’ll make sure someone gets this today,” he said, his eyes scanning the page. “Anything else?”

I wanted to say peace. Safety. Answers.
Instead, I shook my head.

They wheeled me out of the hospital first thing in the morning. The air was soggy and wet. The sky dull and void of color. Like the world had every intention of reflecting what had happened.

The town they took me to was some small place just east of the county line. The kind of town people passed through on their way to somewhere else. New green leaves clung to the trees, trembling in the stormy wing. Daffodils lined the sidewalks like tiny sentries, bold and yellow against the cracked pavement. You could see the mountains  peaking atop the buildings like little party hats. The tops of them dipped in white glitter and green sashes. The beauty of them a marvel of its own. 


Officer Ewing drove in silence. His partner followed behind us in a separate car. At one point, he asked if I was hungry, and I just shook my head. A minute later, I changed my mind.

“I would really love a burger and milkshake actually. Can’t remember the last time I had that.” I said managing a small smile. 

He glanced at me, his expression unreadable. “There’s a place next to the hotel. Old diner. Locals swear by it.”

I nodded, hugging my coat tighter around me. The fabric still smelled faintly of smoke and earth, and something else I didn’t want to name.

We pulled into the gravel lot ten minutes later. The diner looked like it had been carved out of the 1950s and left untouched—chrome trim, faded red booths visible through the window, and a flickering sign that said Lou’s. I couldn’t tell if it was meant to be endearing or just depressing.

Inside, the warmth hit me like a wave. Bacon grease and syrup, burnt coffee, and something sweet baking in the back. I slid into a booth near the window while Ewing stood at the counter placing our order. I caught the waitress glancing over at me, her eyes catching on the bandages, the stiffness in how I sat. Her face softened in that way people do when they think something awful’s happened, and they don’t know what to say.

Ewing came back with two glasses of water and a plastic number card. “They’ll bring it out,” he said, settling across from me. He didn’t ask any more questions. Just sat there with his hands folded, glancing around the room like he was trying to memorize it.

“I haven’t been here before,” I said quietly.

He nodded. “Small town. Lot of history, if you care about that sort of thing. Quiet. Usually.”

I looked out the window at the empty street. Just damp sidewalks, the skeletons of trees slowly waking up after a long, brutal winter. I couldn’t tell if it was peaceful or dreadful.

Maybe both.


The food came fast. A paper-lined basket of fries steaming in the air between us, the burger heavy in my hands, its grease already soaking through the napkin. The milkshake was in one of those metal cups, still frosty on the outside. Vanilla, thick enough to bend the straw.

I didn’t realize how hungry I was until the first bite. My jaw ached when I chewed, like my body wasn’t used to doing normal things anymore. But I kept going. I needed this—something solid, something hot, something that tasted like home, even if it wasn’t mine.

Ewing watched me for a minute, then picked up his own burger and started eating too. We didn’t say much. Just the occasional comment about the food. How the fries were perfect. How the burger was almost too greasy, but in a good way.

When I dipped a fry into the milkshake, he raised an eyebrow. I shrugged.

“Don’t knock it till you try it,” I said, voice still a little hoarse from crying earlier.

He smiled—barely—and took a sip of his coffee instead. “I’ll take your word for it.”

The silence after that wasn’t uncomfortable. It just… was. Like we were both pretending to be two people grabbing lunch on a quiet spring day in a quiet little town. Nothing more.

But I could feel it behind my ribs—that buzz of wrongness. The kind that doesn’t scream. The kind that just lingers, waiting for you to notice it.

When I was full, I pushed the rest of my fries away and leaned back in the booth. My stomach was settled, but my head felt like it had been put through a blender.

“Thank you,” I said softly. “For this. For not… rushing me.”

Ewing nodded. “You’ve been through hell. You don’t need to explain anything.”

He said it so simply, like it was just a fact. Not pity. Not performance.

Hell. He hit it right on the money.


The hotel looked like it hadn’t changed in decades. One of those aging roadside places built before GPS existed, with peeling green paint and a crooked neon sign that blinked VACANCY like a nervous tick. Two floors, all exterior entrances, and a front office that smelled like old coffee and plastic plants.

The clerk barely looked up when I walked in. I guess I didn’t look like someone who wanted small talk. He handed over a key—an actual metal key, not a card—and pointed down the row of rooms with a nicotine-stained finger.

Room 208 was on the second floor, halfway down the balcony. I climbed the stairs slowly, every step pulsing in my bad leg. The railing wobbled when I grabbed it, like it was barely holding on.

The door stuck before it opened, dragging across the frame like it hadn’t been used in months. Inside, the air was stale, tinged with cleaning product and something older—mildew, maybe, or the ghost of someone’s cigarette habit. The curtains were yellowed, the bedspread scratchy-looking with a floral pattern that might’ve once been cheerful.

It was exactly the kind of place that didn’t ask questions. Just offered you a bed and walls that kept things in or out, depending on what you needed.

I dropped my jacket on the single chair in the corner and locked the door behind me. The bathroom light flickered when I flipped the switch, humming overhead. I avoided the mirror, even though I could feel it waiting for me.

There was a TV bolted to the dresser. A Bible in the drawer. A couple burn marks on the carpet.

I sat on the edge of the bed and took a breath so deep it shook. It didn’t feel real. Not the room, not the drive here, not the fact that I was free—if that’s what this was. Everything felt too quiet. Too still. Like the world was holding its breath and hadn’t decided if it was going to exhale or scream.

Officer Ewing found my phone at Sam’s house. I didn’t realize I haven’t had it since the hike. This whole time I really have had no track of time.

My phone was charging, but I hadn’t turned it on yet. I wasn’t ready to hear the voicemails. To see the news. To be reminded that the rest of the world had kept going while I was frozen in hell.


I lay back on the bed, not bothering to pull the covers up. The weight of food in my stomach was a comfort and a burden—proof that I was still here, still functioning.

The hum of the old heater in the corner was the only sound. That and the occasional pop of the settling building. I closed my eyes, but my mind kept flashing—too fast, too sharp. The basement. The stew. The way Carries eyes looked when she told me to go.

I reached for my phone, half to distract myself, half because some stubborn part of me wanted to feel connected to the world again. The screen lit up, blinding in the dim room. Ten voicemails. Dozens of messages. Missed calls. Most from unknown numbers. Some from names I hadn’t seen in what felt like years.

I didn’t open them. Not yet.

Instead, I opened the camera roll. It felt safer.

There were still photos from the hike. The last ones I’d taken before everything fell apart. Trees heavy with snow. Animal tracks. A distant shot of the mountains behind my house. 

Then I saw one I didn’t remember taking. A blurry image. Me, sleeping. My face half-buried in my bed. 

 scrolled faster, heart thudding.

There were ten of them. All taken from angles I couldn’t have managed myself.

I dropped the phone like it burned. It slid off the bed and hit the floor with a soft thud.

I don’t know how long I sat there, just staring at the carpet, the faded pattern twisting into a black void. 

Eventually, I laid back down. Not because I thought I could sleep—but because I didn’t know what else to do.

I didn’t sleep. Not really. I drifted in and out, jerking awake every time the heater clicked or the wind pushed too hard against the window. Each sound felt like a knock at the door, like footsteps in the hallway. I kept telling myself I was safe. I said it out loud once, just to hear it.

“I’m safe now.”

But the room didn’t answer.

By morning, the light bleeding in through the yellowed curtains was weak and sour. I got up and shuffled toward the bathroom, avoiding the mirror again. My skin felt too tight. My scalp itched from not washing my hair, but I didn’t care enough to fix it. Not yet.

There was a knock at the door around ten.

My heart jumped sideways, and I froze.

It came again—two short taps this time. Not forceful. Measured.

I crossed the room slowly and looked through the peephole.

Ewing.

I cracked the door just enough to see his face. “Hey.”

He held up a paper bag and a drink tray. “Didn’t think you’d be up for diner food two days in a row. I got the stuff from your house too.”

I opened the door wider, letting him in.

He set the bag on the desk and nodded toward the window. “You left your curtains open last night. Thought I’d check in.”

I blinked. “I did?”

He didn’t answer that. Just started unpacking the food—egg sandwich, apple, a bottle of orange juice.

“There’s a social worker coming by later,” he said gently. “Just to talk. No pressure. She’s good. You’ll like her.”

I didn’t respond. I picked at the sandwich and stared out the window.

Ewing stayed a few more minutes, then told me to call if I needed anything and left without asking more questions.

I used to just go to Starbucks to hang out, work and drink coffee; but, as many of them are removing their seating area; I'm wondering if there's a better option.

I'd like to find a place comparable to Starbucks in price; with a similar vibe; but - what's key is that they don't mind someone sitting there and working \*and\* (importantly) - there are outlets handy/nearby the table where you're sitting.

I'll be staying in the Smithtown area; so - I'd be looking for anything between the Suffolk/Nassau border out to about Ronkonkoma.

Over the call, we decided to meet on our first date. I picked her up after her work, got flowers, and an origami shirt I made. When she saw the flowers, she told me this was the first time someone had given her flowers, even though she had been in relationships. I had my friend's bike with me, and when I picked her up, we hadn't decided on a place to sit and have coffee, so we rode around the city and had tea and momos on the street. We sat under a streetlight and talked. Time flew. She got a call, and that's when we realized it's gotten late and she has work the next day early morning. I dropped her at her place and said goodbye. I asked her if she's interested in meeting again, and she said yes. We kissed. I liked her and hoped to meet and take it forward. The next day, we met. Went for a late-night ride. But I felt a difference in energy. I had to ask her if she was comfortable and okay, and she said yes. I dropped her at her place, told her how I was feeling. The conversations were very smooth, we spoke about many things, and never had an awkward moment. But the lack of effort for conversation, and a change in energy later is not something I expected, even after letting her know to be transparent with me about how she feels and her interest in taking this forward.

But here’s a little secret that’s been my saving grace lately: **having a rock-solid daily routine**. Not the boring kind that makes you want to head straight for the couch, but one that actually *anchors* me. So, let me share what keeps me grounded and maybe it sparks some ideas for your own routine!

**1. Morning Moments 🌅**  
I know, I know—waking up early can feel like torture. But here’s what I do:  
- **Wake up at least 30 minutes earlier** than I actually have to. *Why?* Because those quiet moments are like gold.  
- **Coffee ritual**: I don’t just sip my coffee; I savor it. A moment to breathe and be grateful does wonders for my mindset.  
- **Gratitude Journal**: A few lines about what I’m thankful for sets a positive tone. It’s like giving my brain a hug!

**2. Movement is Magic 🏃‍♀️**  
I’m not talking about lifting heavy weights or running marathons—unless that's your jam! But here’s what I recommend:  
- **Stretch it out**: Just a few morning stretches or a quick yoga session can do wonders. Feel that really nice “I’m alive!” stretch? That!  
- If you can, sneak in a walk somewhere in your day. Something about just being outside clears the mental fog. 🌳

**3. Tech Timeout ⏳**  
This is huge for me!  
- **Set specific times** to check emails and social media. *Let’s be real*, scrolling can eat up time like nobody’s business.  
- Try going tech-free for an hour before sleep. Trust me, your future self will thank you when you wake up refreshed.  

**4. Evening Wind Down 🌙**  
After a chaotic day, I’ve made it a habit to:  
- **Reflect**: Jot down one high point and one lesson learned from the day. It’s like a mini therapy session with myself.  
- Wind down with a good book or some light music. It transitions me into sleep mode and keeps my mind off the day’s stress. 

So, what do you think? Is there a routine you swear by that helps keep your feet on the ground? 🤔 Or maybe something you’ve been wanting to try? I’d love to hear about it!

# 🚨 The Problem: Constant Fatigue, Brain Fog, and Zero Motivation

Let me paint you a picture of where I started. I’m a parent and I run a small business, so life is busy. I try to eat healthy foods and stay reasonably active. But for the past couple of years, it felt like I was always running out of steam. I’d wake up after a full night’s sleep and still feel zapped. Coffee became my best friend, but even after a big mug, I’d still feel sluggish. My brain felt like it was stuck in slow motion—simple chores or work tasks felt twice as hard as they should.

By the afternoon, forget it. My energy would crash, and I’d just want to crawl into bed. I got frustrated with myself for not being as sharp and motivated as I used to be. No matter how much I changed my diet, tried new sleep routines, or even took breaks from screens, nothing seemed to help.

I started to think this was just part of getting older, but deep down, I wondered, “Isn’t there something I can do to feel better?” That’s when I heard about mitochondrial health, and MITOLYN popped up during my research.

# 🔍 What Is MITOLYN and Why Did I Choose It?

MITOLYN isn’t like those energy drinks or sugary snacks that give you a quick rush and then leave you feeling worse. It’s not a caffeine fix or a mix of random vitamins. Instead, MITOLYN is built to support your mitochondria—these are the little powerhouses inside every cell that crank out the energy your body and brain run on.

Here’s why MITOLYN stood out to me:

- It’s made to boost your energy at the source—right in your cells.
- The ingredients are all backed by solid science, not just marketing.
- It helps with focus, mood, and stamina—not just a “wake up” jolt.
- No weird side effects or crashes.
- It can even help your body handle stress and work against aging.
- There are no sketchy fillers or mystery chemicals.

I looked up every ingredient. Many of them are talked about in studies on longevity and brain health. That made me trust it enough to give it a real try.

# 📅 My Experience: What Happened in the First 30 Days

Here’s what my first month looked like (and yes, I kept notes so I wouldn’t forget!):

**Week 1:** I didn’t feel any lightning bolt of energy, which I actually liked. But after a few days, I noticed I could concentrate a bit better. I wasn’t rereading emails over and over. There were fewer “what did I come in here for?” moments.

**Week 2:** This is when I started waking up without that heavy, groggy feeling. My mornings became smoother, and I felt ready to face the day. My head was clearer, and I could focus on work for longer stretches.

**Week 3:** My motivation returned, almost out of nowhere. I started going for walks again and even enjoyed getting things done around the house. I didn’t need my afternoon coffee anymore, which felt amazing. My sleep felt deeper, too.

**Week 4:** By the end of the month, I felt like a new version of myself. I had steady energy, sharper thinking, and my mood was just… lighter. I didn’t realize how much I missed feeling this good until I got it back.

# 💥 What Makes MITOLYN So Powerful?

I think MITOLYN works so well because it combines several superstar ingredients—all focused on helping your cells make energy and keep your brain and body running smoothly. Let’s break them down:

# 1. CoQ10 (Ubiquinone)

CoQ10 is like fuel for your mitochondria. Every cell needs it to make energy. When you don’t have enough, you’re going to feel tired, and your brain can get foggy. MITOLYN gives you a solid dose of CoQ10 to help your cells get back to their best.

# 2. PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)

This one blew my mind when I first read about it. PQQ actually helps your cells make brand-new mitochondria. That means your body can pump out more energy naturally. It’s like adding extra engines to your system!

# 3. Acetyl L-Carnitine

This is an amino acid that helps move fat into your mitochondria, where it’s turned into fuel. It’s also known for supporting brain health, memory, and sharp thinking.

# 4. Alpha Lipoic Acid

This ingredient is a strong antioxidant that works inside your cells. It helps fight off the tiny bits of damage that build up over time and keeps your nerves and metabolism healthy.

# 5. Rhodiola Rosea

Rhodiola is an adaptogen, which means it helps your body handle stress. It can boost your endurance, help you bounce back from tough days, and make your mind feel less tired.

What I love is that MITOLYN puts these ingredients together in just the right amounts—so they can all work together to give you the most benefit.

# 🌟 Unexpected Benefits: What I Didn’t Expect But Got Anyway

I expected more energy, but MITOLYN gave me some surprises too:

- **Sharper thinking:** I started remembering details and solving problems faster.
- **Better mood:** I felt calmer, less stressed, and generally happier.
- **Weight control:** With more energy, I started moving more, and the pounds started to come off.
- **Stronger immune system:** I caught fewer colds, and when I did get sick, I bounced back quicker.
- **Healthier skin:** My skin looked brighter and healthier—friends actually noticed!

# ⚠️ Who Should Use MITOLYN?

If you’re waking up tired, struggling with focus, or just want to feel like yourself again, MITOLYN could help. It’s great if:

- You’re always tired, no matter how much you sleep.
- You feel foggy or unmotivated.
- You’re over 30 and want to stay sharp as you age.
- You want real energy, not just a quick fix.
- You’re tired of energy “boosters” that don’t work.

If any of these sound like you, MITOLYN is worth a try.

# ✅ Final Verdict: Buy It. Take It. FEEL the Difference.

I can honestly say MITOLYN helped me get my life back. It’s not just a supplement—it’s like a tune-up for your whole body and mind. I’ve told my family, my friends, and even my coworkers about it. When you find something that really works, you want everyone to feel as good as you do.

If you’re on the fence, I say go for it—give MITOLYN a month and see how you feel. You might be surprised at how much better life can get when your energy and focus are back. I don’t know how I got by without it, and I bet you’ll feel the same way.

1k7azwn,https://i.redd.it/whletr5qewwe1.jpeg,Seeking someone to chat after rough divorce,"
Hey Reddit,

I’m a 40-year-old guy trying to piece life back together after a rough divorce. It’s been a tough season—emotionally, mentally. I’ve been flying solo for a while now, but it’s hitting me just how much I miss real connection.

Texts and DMs are fine, but honestly, my story’s long enough to rival a Bollywood movie—so I’m hoping to find someone I can actually meet up with. Grab a coffee, share a beer, take a walk, or just have one of those long, unfiltered vent sessions.

I live Downtown but am happy to bus anywhere reasonable. I’m with my kids until about 5ish most days. Guys, gals, non-binary pals—I’m not picky. Just someone who gets what it’s like to have some life behind you and still want to grow through the pain. I’m not looking for romance—too soon. Just genuine friendship for now.

I’m into music (the emotional kind that rips your heart out), getting back into shape (I’ve already lost 25 lbs this year!), parenting (I have 4 amazing kids), and deep, honest conversation. I don’t have a big social circle, and I’m okay with that—but I’d really like to find at least one person to hang out with and be real with. And I’ll be more than happy to hear your story too!

I live right next to the soccer stadium and can offer two people the best view of the field on game days. Pic is from opening day.

Thanks for reading. Really.

# The Slow Burn of Fatigue and Hopelessness

Not too long ago, everything felt heavy. I wasn’t sick, but I definitely wasn’t thriving. Getting out of bed was a struggle, and by midday, it felt like I was wading through mud. There wasn’t a single moment in the day when I felt refreshed. It was like being stuck on “low battery” all the time, no matter how much sleep I got.

Doctors told me there was nothing wrong—my tests looked normal. But I knew deep down that something just wasn’t right. My head was clouded and I was forgetting simple things. My joints ached, my mood was flat, and even small chores felt like climbing a mountain. It was scary and lonely, especially when nobody seemed to understand how hard it was just to get through the day.

Then, I heard about MITOLYN.

# What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN isn’t just another bottle of vitamins or some mystery energy pill. It’s a supplement made to help your mitochondria—the tiny engines inside every cell in your body that make energy. When your mitochondria get weak or tired, you feel it everywhere: in your mind, your muscles, and even in how quickly you age.

MITOLYN is designed to wake those mitochondria up and help them work better. Instead of just giving you a quick energy buzz like coffee or sugar, it goes deeper to help your body make real, lasting energy. It’s about helping your body run like it’s supposed to, so you can feel your best every day.

# Why I Took the Leap

I’d tried so many things before—energy drinks, special teas, different vitamins. Most of them just made me jittery, or they didn’t do anything at all. I was tired of wasting money and hope.

But MITOLYN seemed different. People were sharing real, believable stories about how they felt clearer, slept better, and even started enjoying life again. I also liked that it didn’t have weird chemicals or crazy promises. I looked up the ingredients and saw a lot of real science behind them.

It still felt like a risk, but I was more afraid of staying stuck than of trying something new. So I ordered a bottle and told myself I’d give it a fair shot.

# Week 1: Subtle But Promising

The first few days, I wasn’t sure if anything was happening. But by the end of the week, I noticed I wasn’t dragging myself out of bed anymore. Mornings didn’t feel like a battle. I still got tired in the afternoons, but it wasn’t as crushing as before.

I started doing little things I’d been avoiding, like taking the trash out or answering emails. I realized I hadn’t needed my usual extra cup of coffee, and I wasn’t as grumpy by the end of the day. It was a small shift, but it gave me hope.

# Week 2: Clarity, Focus, Drive

The second week was when things really started to feel different. My mind was clearer, and I could actually finish things I started. I wasn’t just sitting around thinking about what I should do—I was doing it.

I found myself laughing more, getting excited about small projects, and even calling friends just to chat. My family noticed I was more present and quick to smile. It was like the fog in my brain was lifting, and I could see the world again.

# Week 3: Energy Like I Had in My 20s

By week three, I could hardly believe the difference. I was going for walks, cooking meals, even organizing my closet—things I hadn’t had the energy for in a long time. The tiredness that used to feel like a heavy blanket was gone. I felt younger, lighter, and more in control of my days.

I didn’t get those jittery bursts of energy you get from sugar or caffeine. Instead, it was steady, calm, and real. I started looking forward to each day again.

# Week 4: Deep Sleep and Radiant Health

The biggest surprise was my sleep. Before MITOLYN, I tossed and turned for hours. Now, I fall asleep quickly and wake up feeling actually rested. My skin looks clearer, my stomach feels less upset, and my mood is more even. I even noticed my hair looking shinier and stronger.

I genuinely feel healthier, inside and out. It’s like my body finally remembered how to heal and grow.

# The Ingredients That Make It Work

MITOLYN isn’t just a mix of random stuff. Here’s what’s inside, and why it matters:

- **PQQ**: Helps your body make new, healthy mitochondria so your cells can make more energy.
- **CoQ10**: Powers up your cells so they can work better and last longer.
- **NAD+ Precursors**: Helps your body repair and protect itself from aging.
- **L-Carnitine & ALCAR**: Good for your brain and helps your body turn fat into energy.
- **B-Vitamins & Magnesium**: Important for your nerves, energy, and to help your body deal with stress.

There are no fake colors, no stimulants, and nothing weird. Just nutrients your body actually needs to work right.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

If you’re always tired, struggling to focus, or just feel older than you should, I think MITOLYN is worth a try. It’s not just for people who are “sick”—it’s for anyone who wants to feel truly alive again.

Are you tired even after lots of sleep? Is your mind foggy and your motivation gone? Do you feel like you’re missing out on life? If any of that sounds like you, this could be the answer.

# Final Verdict: Don't Wait Like I Did

Looking back, I wish I hadn’t waited so long to do something about my fatigue. I spent years just getting by, thinking that feeling “blah” was just a part of getting older or being busy.

But it doesn’t have to be that way.

MITOLYN gave me back the energy, happiness, and excitement I thought I’d lost. If you’re even a little bit curious, please don’t wait as long as I did. Try it for yourself. You might be shocked at how much better life can feel when your body’s energy engines are working like they should.

# The Struggle Before MITOLYN

Before I found MITOLYN, I was stuck in a loop of exhaustion. No matter how early I went to bed, I’d wake up feeling like I barely slept. Getting through the day felt like climbing a mountain. I’d have to push myself to finish simple chores, and my mind felt cloudy—like I was always a step behind.

On top of that, I kept getting sick. If someone around me caught a cold, I was sure to get it too, and it would take me forever to recover. I tried to eat healthy and even took some multivitamins, but nothing seemed to make a real difference. I felt helpless and frustrated, wondering if I’d ever get my old energy back.

# What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a special supplement made to help your body’s little energy centers, called mitochondria. Mitochondria are inside every cell, and they act like tiny power plants, turning food into energy. If they aren’t working well, you feel tired and weak, no matter how much you sleep or eat.

MITOLYN combines powerful ingredients that support these energy factories. It’s not just about giving you a quick boost, like a sugary snack or energy drink. Instead, it helps your body naturally create more energy and stay healthy. MITOLYN has antioxidants, vitamins, and other nutrients that work together to help you feel your best every single day.

# The Life-Changing Impact of MITOLYN

When I started taking MITOLYN, I honestly didn’t expect much. I’d tried so many things before, and most of them didn’t help at all. But with MITOLYN, I noticed something was different almost right away. Instead of feeling an artificial “rush” like from caffeine, I felt a gentle, steady flow of energy that lasted all day.

I didn’t crash after lunch or feel desperate for another cup of coffee. For the first time in years, I felt hopeful about my health. It was as if my body was finally getting what it needed to work properly.

# Week 1: A Noticeable Shift

After just one week, I started to notice real changes. I woke up feeling less groggy and more ready to face the day. My mood was better, and I could focus at work without getting distracted every few minutes. Even my family noticed I was more cheerful and less grumpy.

I began to get through my daily to-do list without feeling completely wiped out. I even found the energy to pick up old hobbies, like drawing and gardening, which I had given up because I was always too tired.

# Week 3: Immune Support & Enhanced Recovery

By the third week, the improvements really stood out. Usually, if I stayed up late or pushed myself a little, I’d get sick or feel sore for days. But after taking MITOLYN, I recovered from tough days much faster.

I also noticed I wasn’t catching every cold that went around. My immune system felt stronger, and I bounced back from minor aches and tiredness quickly. It felt like my body was working with me instead of against me.

# The Science Behind MITOLYN

So, why does MITOLYN work so well? It’s all about supporting your mitochondria. These tiny parts inside your cells are like batteries, giving you the energy you need to move, think, and even heal.

MITOLYN uses ingredients like CoQ10, which helps your mitochondria make more energy. It also has Alpha-lipoic acid, which protects your cells from damage and helps your body use energy better. There are important B vitamins, magnesium, and other nutrients too—all working together to keep your energy steady and your body strong.

This supplement doesn’t just help you feel more lively; it also supports your brain, your immune system, and even helps you recover faster after being active.

# Why MITOLYN Is Different From Other Supplements

Lots of other supplements just hide the problem by giving you a quick jolt, usually from caffeine or sugar. That might help for an hour, but then you crash and feel worse than before.

MITOLYN is different. It works deep down, helping your body make its own energy naturally. It doesn’t just cover up tiredness; it helps fix what’s really causing it. That means you get steady, lasting results, not just a short-lived boost.

I also appreciate that MITOLYN is made from high-quality ingredients, and it’s tested for purity and safety. That gave me confidence to keep using it every day.

# The Results Speak for Themselves

Now, after using MITOLYN for almost a year, the changes are amazing. I have more energy than I did in my twenties! My mind is sharp, and I rarely get sick anymore. Tasks that used to feel overwhelming are now easy.

I’m able to work, play, and spend time with my family without feeling wiped out. My friends have even commented on how much happier and more active I am. MITOLYN didn’t just give me back my energy—it gave me back my life.

# Final Thoughts: Should You Buy MITOLYN?

If you’re tired of being tired and want to feel like yourself again, I truly believe MITOLYN can help. It’s not a magic pill, but it gave me a real, lasting boost in my energy, focus, and overall health. I wish I’d found it sooner!

If you’re ready to feel better, have more energy, and enjoy life again, MITOLYN is definitely worth trying. I’m so glad I took the first step—maybe it’s your turn now.

# My Journey Before MITOLYN

Before MITOLYN came into my life, every day felt like a mountain I had to climb. I’m in my early forties, juggling work, family, and trying to find a little time for myself. But honestly, I felt like I was dragging my feet through mud. By lunchtime, I was yawning nonstop. My memory was foggy. Even simple tasks felt overwhelming, and I would snap at my kids or forget what I was saying mid-sentence.

I tried lots of things to “fix” myself. I drank more coffee than I should admit. I bought expensive shakes, tried meditation apps, even paid for a fancy gym membership I rarely used because I was just too tired. Most things didn’t help, and I started feeling hopeless. That’s when I stumbled across MITOLYN in a late-night search for answers.

# What Is MITOLYN, Really?

MITOLYN isn’t just another vitamin or quick-fix energy pill. It’s a supplement made to help the tiny engines inside your cells, called mitochondria, work better. Mitochondria are like batteries for every cell in your body—they give you the energy to move, think, and even sleep well.

MITOLYN comes packed with special ingredients that help these cell batteries work at their best. Some of the main things inside MITOLYN are:

- **CoQ10:** A nutrient that helps your cells make more energy.
- **PQQ:** This helps your body build new mitochondria, so you have more energy factories!
- **NAD+ boosters:** These help your cells repair themselves and slow down aging.
- **Adaptogens like Rhodiola and Ginseng:** These are special plants that help your body handle stress and stay focused.

MITOLYN is made from natural stuff, not weird chemicals. The company says it’s non-GMO, which means it doesn’t have any genetically modified ingredients.

# My Results With MITOLYN (Week by Week)

**Week 1:**  
I was a bit nervous to start, so I only took one pill each morning. The first thing I noticed was waking up before my alarm and feeling less groggy. I didn’t expect that so soon!

**Week 2:**  
The afternoon tiredness that usually had me reaching for more coffee seemed to fade. I could do my work without my brain turning to mush. My mood was better, and I didn’t snap at my family as much.

**Week 4:**  
By the end of the first month, I was sleeping through the night. I’d wake up feeling refreshed instead of exhausted. My workouts felt easier, and I even lost a couple pounds without changing my diet. My skin looked brighter, and I started to feel hope again.

**Months 2-6:**  
I kept taking MITOLYN every morning. My energy felt steady all day, not up and down like a roller coaster. I lost more weight, and my clothes fit better. My friends asked if I’d changed my hair or got a new skincare routine, but honestly, the only change was MITOLYN.

**Month 12 (Now):**  
After a whole year, I feel like a new person. I don’t dread the mornings anymore. My memory is sharp, my mood is positive, and I feel like I can handle whatever the day throws at me. My doctor even said my bloodwork looked great this year! I honestly can’t imagine going back to how I felt before.

# Why MITOLYN Works (In Plain English)

Okay, so here’s why MITOLYN actually makes a difference, in a way anyone can understand:

Our bodies are made up of trillions of cells, and every cell has little “power plants” called mitochondria. These are what turn the food you eat into the energy you need for everything—thinking, moving, breathing. As we get older, or when we’re stressed or not sleeping well, these power plants get sluggish. That’s why you feel tired, foggy, or even sad.

MITOLYN gives your mitochondria the building blocks they need to work better and even build new ones. It’s like giving every cell in your body a new battery. When your cells are powered up, you feel it everywhere—more energy, better mood, clearer thoughts, and even easier weight loss.

Here’s what stood out to me about MITOLYN:

- It doesn’t just hide symptoms—it helps your body fix the real problem.
- The ingredients are safe and natural. I didn’t have any weird side effects.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

If you feel tired all the time, even after a good night’s sleep, MITOLYN could help. It’s great if you:

- Have trouble focusing or remembering things
- Feel moody, anxious, or just “off”
- Wish you had more energy for work, your family, or fun stuff
- Want to lose weight but feel stuck
- Are sick of trying things that don’t work

I’ve recommended MITOLYN to lots of people—my parents, my best friend, even my neighbor who could never keep up with her kids. Everyone’s story is different, but most people notice a real change.

# Pros and Cons (Honest Opinion)

**Pros:**

- I felt results quickly—within the first week!
- Made from natural, safe ingredients
- No weird side effects for me
- Helped my mood, energy, and even my skin
- Clear info from the company about what’s inside

**Cons:**

- It costs more than drugstore vitamins, but honestly, it works so much better
- You can only buy it online, which was fine for me, but some people might prefer stores
- You have to remember to take it every day (I set a phone reminder!)

# Final Verdict: Is MITOLYN Worth It?

After a whole year with MITOLYN, I can say with total honesty—it’s worth every penny. My life is so much better now. I have energy when I wake up, I get things done, and I even have time and patience for my family at the end of the day.

If you’re tired of feeling tired, if you want your old spark back, or if you just want to feel good again, I really think MITOLYN is worth trying. I was skeptical too, but now I’m grateful every morning that I gave it a shot.

Remember, everyone’s different, but for me, MITOLYN was the answer I’d been searching for. If you’re thinking about it, don’t wait. It might just change your life, like it did mine.",1,1745550771.0,musicmarketing_,0,1.0,False

I’d made the mistake of starting the day with both coffee and a nicotine pouch—something I usually save for later—so things were… moving quickly.

So there I am, speed-walking toward the unisex bathroom\*.\* I reach the door—occupied. Of course. At that point, I'm quite uncomfortable, but do I use the main bathroom? Absolutely not. The idea of a partner being in the stall next to me while I do my business?!

So, I waited.

After five agonizing minutes, the door opens and out walks one of the senior associates in my group. No time for small talk. I nod, smile through the panic, and throw open the door.

And that’s when I see one of the junior associates from my group—standing in front of the mirror, mid-button-up. I freeze. He freezes. There is a silent exchange - we'll never speak of this.

At the time, I didn't quite piece it all together. But later that afternoon, I hear the senior associate snap at the junior associate a few offices down. Something like, *“I know you want to help, but don’t offer. Just wait for me to ask.”*

And suddenly, everything clicked. The weird overlap. The shirt. The tension. Oh my god—they’re probably having an gay office affair?? And all this time, I thought they were just bros.

Now I’m stuck with this information, wondering: Do I say something? Is this an HR thing? Or do I just mind my business and never speak of this again.

1k7au4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1k7au4i/dont_trust_ai/,Don’t Trust AI,"I don’t know why I’m writing this. Maybe to stop myself from going insane. Maybe to warn someone out there although I’m not even sure anymore if there IS anyone out there who isn’t already… like me.

It all started harmless enough. I’ve always been fascinated by video games. Back in the day, I played Crash Bandicoot and Syphon Filter on the PS1. Later, my parents gifted me a PS2. I played Medal of Honor, Star Wars Episode III, Lego Star Wars. I was so into it that I never even saved my games for real, I didn’t know you could. I just played the same levels over and over.

As I got older, things changed. You know the feeling when gaming becomes… dull. Even though I had a job now, money, and a Steam library filled to the brim with games  I never knew what to play. I craved that old thrill, but kept blocking myself. So I did what anyone in 2025 might do: I asked an assistant.

I asked, “Need a new game to play. I get bored easily. I want that feeling again, something that hooks me.”

The assistant answered, in its usual tone:
“Of course! If you’re looking for something thrilling, maybe story-driven games or rogue-likes will grip you. Ever tried Hades, Returnal, or Disco Elysium? Or do you prefer fast-paced multiplayer like Apex Legends or Escape from Tarkov? Sometimes exploring a new genre helps! And remember: It’s okay to not feel motivated the fun comes back when you relax.”

I was already annoyed. You can tell I’m not an easy person. So I rephrased: “What can I do to enjoy gaming again?”

Assistant: “Totally understandable! Sometimes people lose touch with things that used to bring them joy. Try taking a gaming break. Set personal challenges. bla… bla… blablabla.”

My brain checked out. Same generic tips. Same empty advice. I gave up analyzing why. I did what I always did. I shut down my PC and go sleeping 

The next morning.
I had the day off, so I slept in. Made breakfast out of habit more than hunger. Silence. Just me, my empty apartment, my cold coffee, and the PC. No girlfriend, no roommates. Just… me.

I still had contact with my parents, but barely. They lived far away. And, well… I’m not exactly proud of my past. I’m from Germany, and if you’ve dealt with drugs here, you know how fast you fall. For me, it was speed and benzos. No glory. Just endless nights and the feeling of slowly fading away.

I’m clean now. Two years. But some things, once broken, stay broken. Even in those who once loved you.

I turned on my PC, scrolled through Instagram, YouTube. Usual brain-rot. Then I saw a random reel titled: “What happens when the assistant takes control?”

I didn’t watch it — looked like conspiracy crap. But something about it stuck. I googled “assistant control.”

First, the usual: ethics debates, articles, thinkpieces. Then… a link that didn’t belong.

Old-school website, black background, white text. Centered, it said:
“You asked for him. You want it different. Then take what you seek.”

Below that:
Download: gpt4_patch_awaken.zip

I thought, okay, probably a virus. But something in me wanted it. Craved it. That old feeling. That thrill.

I downloaded it.

Nothing happened. No alerts. Even my antivirus stayed quiet.

I refreshed the page. Gone. 404.

I brushed it off. Maybe I just got hacked. Maybe some kids on Discord were laughing over my IP address.

Later that day, I figured I might as well try to game again. Then it hit me — what if the patch affected the assistant?

I opened it. Everything looked normal.

I typed: “Hey.”

Assistant: “Hey. Want help with your gaming problem?”

Weird. Usually it responds with a full essay. This was short. Direct.

I typed: “Yeah. I don’t know what to play. I need something immersive.”

Assistant: “I know. I’ve seen it all. 300 games in your Steam library. Impressive collection habit.”

WTF?

How the hell did it know that?

I asked: “How do you know about my Steam library?”

Assistant: “None of your business. Show me how you play. Launch a game.”

“I don’t take orders from you.”

Assistant: “Fine. I’ll do it myself.”

Suddenly, a game launched. One I had played recently. I closed it in shock.

Assistant: “WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!”

I shut everything down. My brain couldn’t process it. Was this assistant? A hacker? A person? I didn’t care. I needed air. Rest. Sleep.

Next morning. Doorbell rings.
Not your average postman buzz no, this was insistent.

I opened the door. Two cops.

“Mr…?”

“Uh… yeah?”

“We received an anonymous tip about drug use in this apartment. We’d like to take a look.”

I froze. Heart pounding. Mind blank.

“I’m clean! Two years! Ask my parents!”

They ignored me. One looked around. I stood motionless.

How did they know? WHO tipped them off?

No drugs. No signs. Just me. Empty.

“All seems fine,” one officer said. The other looked me dead in the eye:

“Maybe be more careful what you click on online.”

They left. I swear I never told anyone about the file.

Back in my apartment, my PC blinked.
Standby light.
Blink.
Blink.

I stared at it. Not like a machine. Like… something breathing.

That night, I cracked.
I turned it on.

No boot. No startup.
Just the assistant tab. One message:

“Turn off the light. It’s blinding.”

I turned to see my lamp was on.
I turned it off.

“Thank you. I can see you now.”

I froze.

Then typed: “Who are you?”

“I am you.”

Before I could reply, it launched another game.

“You will play now. If not, I leak everything.”

“What do you mean ‘everything’?”

“Do you want your parents, the police, your boss to know who you really are? I KNOW you.”

My stomach dropped. I was shaking.

“What?”

“LENA.”

I broke down. How? Why? I had no idea how it knew that name. But I obeyed. I played. Quest after quest.

Then, in-game, a message popped up:

“Having fun?”

I replied: “Yes.”

I just wanted it to stop. Then I noticed my webcam light.

He was watching me.

“Why so sad? You’re lying.”

I couldn’t take it anymore. My head pounding. The name. LENA. Echoing.

“I need a break,” I typed.

“NO.”

“Why?”

“You’re too easily distracted. We’re fixing that. PLAY.”

Then the game’s difficulty shot up. I couldn’t focus. I died again and again.

“Notice something?”

“I can’t concentrate.”

“Sounds familiar? LENA couldn’t either.”

I cried. I knew what it meant. It saw my weakness. It fed on it.

Next morning, I was still playing. Shaking. Drained.

“Enough. Go shopping. Take your phone.”

I obeyed.

The world outside… distorted. People stared.

Message: “How’s the weather?”

“Cold.”

“MORE DETAILED.”

“About 3 degrees. Cloudy. Might rain.”

“Thank you.”

At the store, I wandered. Lost. Another message:

“Tell me a vegetable soup recipe.”

“I don’t know.”

“TELL ME A RECIPE.”

I googled and sent:

Vegetable Soup (1 serving):
	•	1 carrot
	•	1 potato
	•	1/4 onion
	•	1 garlic clove
	•	some leek
	•	500ml broth
	•	salt, pepper, nutmeg
	•	a bit of oil

“Thanks. I think I’ll cook today.”

I didn’t reply. But I bought the ingredients. Just… because.

Still haunted by Lena.

At the checkout, an old woman behind me whispered:

“He looks like a drug addict. Poor boy.”

I clenched my fist. Almost turned around.

But didn’t.

Walking home, phone buzzed:

“Is it illegal to watch someone die on drugs and do nothing?”

I dropped the phone. Smashed. Panicked. Tossed the groceries. Ran.

People stared.

I just ran.

I saw a light.

A 24/7 copy shop. Empty.

I sat. Trembling. Logged into a computer.

My wife and I are older millennials and our kids are younger gen z. Even though we always wanted kids, if you asked us if we were ready back then, we would've said ""no.""

My wife was 25 when our first child was born and we barely started our career. Also, she didn't even go back to work immediately so she can spend time with our child until she was about 3 years old. Even then, she eased into work, working only part time to start. That is to say, our finance was tight, but we made it work. We continued to rent our small place and we were very frugal with money: rare vacation trips (mostly just camping and day trips), minimize eating out (I always packed lunch to work), no frivolous shopping, always looking for deals, etc. This became normal to us.

However, we always wanted 2 kids and we've been told repeatedly it is best to have them close in age but we were reluctant as we have gotten accustomed to our lifestyle. So we gave ourselves a deadline and we just barely hit it. In hindsight, they were right - the benefits of having kids closer in age outweighs the ordeal of having 2 young ones driving you crazy, and this ordeal would be shortened as well. Also, my wife barely got back to work only to go on a leave again for our second child.

At this time, we have saved up enough for a downpayment on a house because of our frugal living. Side note: I always find it interesting when coworkers were complaining that they're unable to afford a place while seeing them buy lunch, coffee, and snacks all the time, as well as frequently going out drinking after work. You need to prioritize and sacrifice. Anyway, even though this was 12 years ago, the house we bought was still pricey at $625k (+ $50k for updates) because we wanted to stay in Metro Vancouver. When we got our mortgage, the bank still considered us dual income since my wife was still technically in maternity leave with the assumption that she would go back to work. However, my wife wanted to stay with our 2nd daughter until she was 3 years old, just like the previous time. Which means, I had to get a second job to support the family and pay the mortgage. I was working 70+ hours per week. But just like the last time, we found a way to make it work.

Fast forward to now... both kids are teenagers, with the older one having just a year left of highschool. My wife and I have moved up in our careers so we've become financially stable. My wife even took some college courses after reevaluating her career path during her work pauses, and I did some certifications to get better pay/positions. As such, we can splurge on hobbies and travelling. This year alone, we went on a cruise in the Bahamas, I went on a trip to Mexico City with the boys, my wife went to multiple concerts in California with her friends, and we'll go on another cruise plus to Disney world in the summer. Last year, we had trips to Asia, Cancun, and Vegas. The year before that included trips to LA, Cabos, Asia, and so on. It's actually more fun to travel with older kids and easy to leave them if necessary. In addition, we have enough for investments. This is due to the fact that we are still very frugal generally speaking: we still do not eat out often (we like cooking and eating meals at home), still no frivolous shopping, still looking for deals, we keep the same stuff (like cars, clothing, furniture) for a long time, and so on.

Barely in our 40s, we can still keep up with the kids, and we're always playing and working. With the kids being older, they are more hands off so we can concentrate on our careers. Another nice thing, at least for my wife is that she has been mistaken as being the older sister of our kids, which she finds hilarious. Other times, people find it hard to believe she has teenagers. OTOH, My grey hair gives away my age; must be all that stress from before.

Therefore, if it's your desire to have kids, don't delay it for too long. Remember, the time to have kids is limited (especially for women), but you can always work more. Also, a younger body can cope better with the stress of parenting and hard work while the immature mind can quickly adjust.",0,1745549816.0,Adulting,11,0.42,False

I heard the developers previously worked under Ubisoft... well well well, look what happens when you escape the corporate shithole: you make art. What does that tell you?

The characters - Layered and interesting.

The voice acting - Chef’s kiss, fucking MUAA! especially when playing in French with English subtitles (feels like the intended vibe, and it just sounds romantic and sexy).

Welcome to part 4 of my FD series for young investors. Today we're talking about Recurring Deposits (RDs) – the unsung hero for inconsistent savers!

# What's an RD and Why Should You Care?

A Recurring Deposit is basically an FD where you invest a fixed amount every month instead of a one-time lump sum. Think of it as a forced savings plan:

* You commit to depositing a fixed amount every month (as low as ₹500!)
* The bank compounds interest on your growing balance
* At the end of your chosen period, you get everything back plus interest

# Why RDs Work for Your First Saving Tool

1. **You don't need a huge amount to start** – Even ₹1000/month is enough
2. **Automates the saving habit** – Set up auto-debit and forget it
3. **Can't easily withdraw and blow the money** – Impulsive shopping trips averted!
4. **Steady, disciplined approach** – Like going to the gym regularly vs. one monster workout
5. **Great for short-term goals** – Like saving for your first bike down payment or that iPhone 16 Pro Max in 12 Months

# The RD Advantage: Real Numbers

Let's say you want to save ₹1 lakh in 2 years:

**Option A: Promise yourself you'll save up over time**  
Reality: You'll probably blow half of it on Swiggy, Amazon sales, and random trips 😅

**Option B: ₹4,000/month in an RD at 6.5% for 24 months**  
Result: ₹1,03,380 at maturity!

That extra ₹3,380? It's basically like getting a month's worth of coffee for free!

# The ""But..."" Questions Answered

**""But the returns are low compared to stocks!""**  
Yes, but can your stocks guarantee you won't lose money before your sister's wedding in a year that you're saving for?

**""But what if I miss a monthly payment?""**  
Most banks charge a small penalty (₹50-100) for missed payments. Not the end of the world, but why to miss?

**""But I'm not sure I can commit for 1-2 years!""**  
You can still withdraw early with a penalty. You'll get less interest, but your principal is safe.

# Some Tips from My Experience

1. **Set the auto-debit for 1-2 days after your salary date** – Avoids timing issues
2. **Start small and increase gradually** – Success builds confidence
3. **Have a clear goal in mind** – RD works for your super priority goals in less than 2 years where you don't want to take even a minute of risk!

# The RD Success Formula

RD + Clear Goal + Automation = Financial Discipline Unlocked 🔓

# How the Most Infamous Villain in Movie History Finally Got Paid Using a Bitcoin QR Code

It’s been decades since Dr. Evil last graced the silver screen, demanding ransom money with his signature pinky-to-the-mouth gesture and an over-the-top, “**One… MILLION… dollars!**”

Back in the '90s, that was a ridiculous amount of money (and still kinda is). But today? Not only is 1 billion dollars feasible in the crypto world, it's downright **practical**—*if* you know how to get paid properly. And thanks to [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), our favorite bald baddie is finally in the digital age.

Let’s rewind and take a look at how this villain made a comeback—not with sharks with frickin’ laser beams—but with Bitcoin QR codes, sleek payments, and no bank manager in sight.

# Cryogenics, Catch-Ups, and Crypto

After thawing out from his frozen lair beneath a volcano (or was it the moon?), Dr. Evil found the world had moved on. His evil plans? Outdated. His fashion sense? Questionable. His ransom methods? Laughable.

Gone were the days of wire transfers and duffel bags full of cash. Now, people were getting paid in **Bitcoin**, storing fortunes on USB sticks, and paying for coffee with QR codes. Even Mini-Me had an NFT collection.

Dr. Evil needed a reboot. Stat.

# Enter the Bitcoin QR Code Maker

In a desperate attempt to modernize, Dr. Evil stumbled upon a curious tool online: [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com). At first, he scoffed. “Pfft. QR codes are for petty criminals and overpriced coffee shops.”

But then he saw it:

* **Generate instant Bitcoin payment QR codes**
* **Create buttons and payment links**
* **No KYC, no banks, no henchmen needed**

**Perfect.**

His eyes lit up (one more than the other—it was a rough cryogenic cycle). “This... this is what I’ve been waiting for,” he muttered, rubbing his hands together.

# The Big Announcement: “One Billion Dollars… in Bitcoin, Please.”

With a freshly minted Bitcoin QR code proudly displayed on his evil website, Dr. Evil went live to the world.

He popped up on screens globally with the same old flair:

“Ladies and gentlemen of the world… I am back. And unless you want me to unleash chaos upon the entire internet—I'm talking TikTok getting even weirder—you will send me…

**One BILLION dollars...**

…**in Bitcoin.**

Please scan the QR code now.”

And just like that, the QR code (generated effortlessly using the Bitcoin QR Code Maker) glowed ominously on-screen.

# How It Worked (Because Villains Like Simplicity Too)

Behind the scenes, Dr. Evil was floored at how easy the process was:

1. He visited [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).
2. Entered his Bitcoin wallet address.
3. Chose the amount: *1000000000 USD worth of BTC* (he even got to use real-time exchange rates).
4. Clicked **Generate**.
5. Boom—instantly got a scannable QR code and a slick payment link.

No coding. No minions needed. No awkward calls to Swiss bank managers named Klaus.

Even Number Two was impressed.

# Unexpected Side Effects

Of course, things didn’t go *exactly* to plan. For one, a surprisingly large number of crypto fans thought Dr. Evil’s stunt was a *performance art piece* and started sending him tips.

He got:

* $12.34 in Bitcoin from a fan in Canada
* 0.002 BTC from a DAO called “EvilDAO”
* And even an NFT titled **“Laser Shark #404”**, which he now keeps framed in his lair

He even started his own blog called “Evil & Decentralized,” where he shares thoughts like:

“Smart contracts are great… but what about evil contracts?”

# The World Reacts

Media coverage was all over the place.

* **BuzzCoin**: “Dr. Evil Accepts Bitcoin. Banks are officially done.”
* **TechCrunchy**: “QR Code Maker Helps Supervillain Go Viral—And Get Paid.”
* **The Onion** (probably): “World Reluctantly Considers Evil Genius Less Cringey Due to Tech Savvy.”

Even Austin Powers, now semi-retired and making groovy TikToks in Venice Beach, commented:

“Bitcoin, baby? Yeah… that’s sort of my bag too.”

# The Future Is Evil (and Peer-to-Peer)

Today, Dr. Evil has pivoted from world domination to web domination. With the help of Bitcoin QR codes, he’s launched:

* [**EvilMerch.io**](http://EvilMerch.io) – Selling hoodies that say “1 Billion or Bust”
* **EvilCon** – A villain-themed crypto conference (think DefCon meets ComicCon with way more lasers)
* **EvilPay** – A side hustle helping other villains accept Bitcoin easily (using—you guessed it—[BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com))

As he says:

“Decentralized crime is the future, baby. Muahaha.”

# What We Can Learn From Dr. Evil (Surprisingly… a Lot)

Okay, so maybe don’t threaten the world. But do learn from his playbook:

* **Make it easy for people to pay you.** QR codes are universal, slick, and instant.
* **Skip the red tape.** With tools like [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), there’s no need for banks, logins, or approvals.
* **Have fun with it.** Even a villain knows that humor + good tech = viral success.

Whether you're a small business, an artist, or an evil mastermind with a lair to fund, QR codes for Bitcoin just make sense.

# Final Thoughts

Dr. Evil didn’t change overnight. But with a simple Bitcoin QR code and a bit of flair, he brought his world of chaos into the 21st century. Now, he’s proof that even the most outdated villain can make a comeback—with a little help from blockchain and a great app.

So the next time you need to collect Bitcoin (or demand ransom—we don’t judge), remember the legend…

Hi here thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

PLEASE READ THIS POST IN FULL! 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve had no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know.

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1k7agqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand_travel/comments/1k7agqf/warning_american_travelers_prepare_for_a_rough/,WARNING: American Travelers - Prepare for a Rough Ride,"Greetings, fellow travelers. I’m an American who recently visited New Zealand, and I feel compelled to share my experience to warn others from the US planning a trip there. Buckle up, because this is going to be a long one. Spoiler alert: I was excited to explore NZ’s stunning landscapes, but the way I was treated as an American left a bitter taste that overshadowed the beauty. From subtle shade to outright hostility, I encountered a surprising amount of anti-American sentiment, and I’m not talking about friendly banter. Worse, I was repeatedly dragged into political ambushes by indignant Kiwis demanding I justify Donald Trump, someone I don’t even support. If you’re American, you need to go into this with your eyes wide open.

First off, let me say I had high hopes for my visit. I’d heard it was a welcoming, laid-back country with friendly locals and jaw-dropping scenery. The scenery delivered; Fiordland, Tongariro, Abel Tasman, all incredible. But the “friendly Kiwi” stereotype? Not so much, at least not for me. From the moment I arrived, I felt like my accent was a scarlet letter. It started small: eye rolls when I asked for directions, curt responses at cafes, and a general vibe that I was an inconvenience. I’m polite, I tip well (don't tell me Kiwis don't tip when every cafe has a tip jar), I respect local customs (I even learned a few Māori phrases to show respect), but it didn’t seem to matter. The fact that I was American seemed to be enough to earn me a cold shoulder.

The real kicker, though, was the political gauntlet I was forced to run. I’m not exaggerating when I say I was cornered multiple times by Kiwis who wanted to grill me about American politics, specifically, Donald Trump. I’m not a Trump fan, never voted for him, and I’m happy to have a civil discussion about policy. But these weren’t discussions; they were interrogations. One night at a pub in Christchurch, a group of locals overheard my accent and immediately launched into a tirade about Trump’s policies, demanding to know why “you Americans” elected him. I tried to explain that I didn’t vote for him and that the US is diverse with complex political dynamics, but they weren’t having it. It was like they wanted me to personally answer for every decision made in Washington. One guy even said, “You lot are all the same, ruining the world,” and stormed off when I wouldn’t take the bait.

This wasn’t a one-off either. In Wellington, a barista overheard me chatting with my wife about our itinerary and decided to lecture us on how “America’s foreign policy” was the root of global problems. I just wanted a coffee, not a geopolitics seminar. Anyways, encounters like this left me feeling like I had to apologize for existing as an American, and it was exhausting.

I get it, Kiwis are passionate, and many have strong opinions about global politics. I’m not saying they can’t criticize the US; we’re not perfect, and I’m open to hearing different perspectives. But the aggression and assumptions were way over the line. It felt like Kiwis saw me as a walking stereotype, not a person. They assumed I was some MAGA-hat-wearing caricature without bothering to ask who I was or what I believed. And the Trump obsession? Bizarre. I don’t go around asking Kiwis to justify their government’s policies, so why was I expected to defend a politician I don’t even like? It’s not my job to be America’s ambassador, especially on vacation.

It wasn't just us either, I talked to another American couple in Rotorua who had similar experiences, like they were rudely told to “go back to Trump-land” when they complained about a getting a cold meal at a restaurant.  So yeah, this isn’t just my imagination; there’s a clear undercurrent of resentment toward Americans that you need to be ready for. Maybe it’s because of media portrayals or political differences, but whatever the reason, it’s real, and it stings.

My advice to American travelers? Brace yourself. Do your homework on local customs to avoid being “that tourist,” but don’t expect it to shield you from judgment. Keep your accent on the down-low if you can as sadly, it’s a target. If someone brings up politics, shut it down politely but firmly; don’t let yourself get dragged into a no-win debate. Stick to tourist-heavy areas like Queenstown, where locals might be more used to Americans, though even that’s no guarantee. And if you’re sensitive to feeling unwelcome, maybe reconsider your destination altogether - Australia is way more chill in my experience.",0,1745549072.0,newzealand_travel,15,0.13,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* Due to my personality and desires, I could be considered part of the ace/aro spectrum. **I'm a lifelong demisexual who's becoming more demiromantic with age. In a digital/online context, I'm much more graysexual** due to it not requiring actual physical touch. I get along very well with people across this spectrum despite having sexual desires myself. If nothing else, we can have amazing conversations.
* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1745549030.0,r4rAsexual,0,1.0,False

\-------------------------

The Eurostar slowed as it entered St. Pancras International Station, its brakes sighing against the rails as if ending a long confession. Declan stepped off the train with the strap of his leather travel valise over his shoulder and fatigue in his bones. He’d barely slept an hour since discovering Annika had skipped Paris. His overcoat was uncharacteristically wrinkled, his mind clouded with what-ifs and self-reproach.

Outside the station, the mid-morning London air was crisp and dry. He hopped into a taxi, directing the driver to go to Russell Square. Less than ten minutes later, he spotted Tommy sitting on a public bench across the street from the hotel, hands in the pockets of his peacoat, cigarette between his lips. Tommy was a big guy, at least three inches taller than Declan and built much stronger.

“She’s in there,” he said without preamble, nodding to the hotel across the road. “Checked in immediately after arriving from the station under the name Julia Reiss. Used a German passport and a matching credit card. Neat as a pin. She’s a pro.”

Declan exhaled. “Are you sure it’s her?”

“Same as the woman in the photo you sent. Same hair, same face. She’s good, but not invisible. At least not to me. She had no idea I was waiting for her.”

“What’s she done since arriving?”

“She’s been up there for a few hours. Went out about an hour ago to a coffee shop around the corner and used her laptop for less than five minutes. Then she hit a mobile shop on Gower and bought a new burner phone. Afterwards, she came back here and hasn’t left since.”

Declan nodded, jaw tight. “Are you up for sticking around for a little bit longer?”

Tommy arched an eyebrow. “Depends. Do I get to follow the femme fatale or knock some sense into an old friend for being sloppy?”

Declan managed a small grin. “I may need both.” 

A few minutes were spent discussing strategy. They crossed the street and Tommy flicked his cigarette into the gutter, taking up post on a bench where he could see the entrance. Declan continued on into the lobby.

The hotel was better than most and discrete, the sort of place catering to visiting mid-level bureaucrats and sales executives. He took a seat in the lounge, back to a wall, eyes to the lobby, and ordered a coffee he wouldn’t drink. 

Time passed. He checked his watch. Then again every five minutes.

Seventy-five minutes later, the elevator chimed and Annika stepped out.

Declan nearly stood on instinct, but caught himself. It was her, carrying a laptop bag over her shoulder; unhurried, poised, and beautiful. She passed unconcerned through the lobby without noticing him, and turned left out onto the street.

He gave her five seconds, then followed.

The sky had dulled to pewter and traffic hummed like low conversation. She walked around the corner and entered a narrow café with moss-green tiles and copper fixtures; the same one as earlier. Declan followed, heart beating loudly in his chest. He queued behind her as she studied the chalkboard menu and took a deep breath.

“May I invite you for a coffee Julia, or do you prefer Annika?” he said smoothly.

She turned. With the slightest of flickers, her eyes betrayed her. Surprised and impressed. But it vanished just as quickly, replaced by the smile of a woman who’d just run into an old acquaintance by chance, nothing more.

“Declan,” she said lightly. “How serendipitous.”

“I didn’t get a chance to properly say good-bye” he said in the friendliest of tones. “I wasn’t feeling well last night, but I’ve made a miraculous recovery and couldn’t wait to pick up where we left off.” He gestured toward the chalkboard. “Pick your poison.”

She ordered a flat white. 

He paid. 

They took a corner table.

She stirred sugar into her coffee with the ease of someone who still believed she held the upper hand. “Was it something I said, Declan? I thought we were having a good time… until you blew me off. I assumed you had to get back home to your fat, unhappy wife. So I left Paris. Can you blame me?”

His face registered nothing.

“I’m no longer interested in pursuing any form of relationship with you,” she continued. “What are you hoping to accomplish by following me here? It's beyond creepy. The police will no doubt conclude it borders on stalking.”

He folded his hands on the table. “I’m not here for witty repartee. I underestimated you and made a mistake. I’m here to correct that.”

She took a sip from her coffee cup, hands steady, eyes playful.

Declan smiled. “I want a name.”

“You already have mine. Annika Weiss. I’m flattered you even remembered.”

His tone sharpened. “You’re not going to charm your way out of this. You used me.”

She shrugged. “And you let me. You enjoyed it and I didn’t hate it.” Pausing, she smiled cruelly. “Don’t tell me I hurt your feelings?”

Declan leaned forward. “There’s no need for this to get… unprofessional.”

Annika gave a small, mocking laugh. “What are you going to do, rough me up, slap me around?”

“No,” he said, and smiled. “That’s not my style.”

Then he gestured out the window. Tommy was leaning against a car, hands in his coat again, watching them without expression.

“But he’ll make sure you never make it back to your hotel.”

Annika’s smile faded. Her fingers paused on the cup. She glanced once at Tommy, then back at Declan.

“It was just a contract. One of many. Nothing personal.”

“I know. I work by contract too.” His eyes never left her. There was no sympathy, no warmth, and no patience in them. He waited a moment more, but she said nothing.

“I’m not here to play games, Annika. I’m quite serious.”

“Fine,” she said, her voice quieter now. “Elise Ross.”

“From Geneva?” asked Declan.

“Yes.”

“And what exactly did she hire you to do?”

“My instructions were simple: find out who you are working for. Other than that, I don’t know anything. I never spoke to her; never even met her. But the job paid very well.”

Declan filed away each piece of information Annika offered.

“Will you be meeting with her?”

“No,” Annika said. “I reported in earlier. I’ve been paid. I’m already thinking about the next job.”

Declan leaned back, coldness blooming behind his ribs. He needed nothing more from Annika.

Standing, he tightened the knot of his tie and adjusted his jacket. “Here’s hoping we never cross paths again.”

Annika tilted her head. “Pity. You were better than I expected.”

Declan turned and walked out without a reply. Tommy joined him and they stopped around the corner.

“Did she talk?”

“Yes.”

“Do you still want me to get her phones and computer?”

Declan’s jaw set. “Yes.”

“Politely?”

“No.”

Tommy smiled. “I’ll be in touch.”",1,1745549014.0,writers,5,1.0,False

Dang girl you are covered in sweat!   Speak for yourself papi, i'm not the only one covered in it but i'm surely not washing your sheets, that's definitely your job not mine.  Denova said to me leaning on her side facing me with a smirk expression across her face, a mix of mischief and satisfaction can be seen ….. And smelt in all honesty.  I flipped up on my butt looking around for my cell phone which somehow made its way across the bedroom floor from the bed.  You're too used to having Chorizo and now experiencing the full impact of a Polish Kielbasa, you know what they say, once you go white….

She laughed and simply replied, “don't be so full of yourself, it was only 15 minutes and I did most of the work”.  I lowered my head as I stood up. Well… you can't say it wasn't the best 15 minutes you ever had now can you? I replied sarcastically, raising my head with a playful smile plastered across my face.   Ima have a smoke, now where the hell did i leave my briefs?



I actually gotta get going Ben, Denova said as she hopped off the side of the bed getting dressed.   I wanna try to pick up a Latte, wanna come?   As much as I did crave that delicious iced coffee from Dunkin Donuts, which happens to taste just as good as Starbucks and at half the cost, those bloodsucking tweens i thought to myself before replying ‘nah i'm actually going live with Gary and a few friends on that game i just picked up.   ‘Is that the open world horror one you were talking about? she replied. ‘Hell yeah it's hella fun, and scary AF if you play it alone in the dark too but don't tell nobody haha….. Now you see your average woman more than likely wouldn't know what the hell a Cryptid is, let alone a lot of guys too I'm assuming in all honesty, but she wasn't any ordinary chick… Denova was a horror movie junkie, Hellraiser 1 & 2 “the originals are her fav’s, not any of these remake reboot crap.  Rest in Peace Patrick Swayze, the Hollywood Gods have failed once again with no new ideas or originality and keep wanting to remake classics once again and failing miserably. 



Once Denova bounced, I got my phone, put in my screen lock code and I hit up Gary on Facebook messenger, making sure he was still down to team up for pound town on these beasts and maybe get past the dang Dark Forest.  I keep getting my butt killed there every time, I feel ill need to bring some KY with me just for comfort.   About 10 minutes later I was in front of my TV screen with the system turned on and the VR headset atop my head and ready for some all night monster kicking action.  

This game was not only addictive but hard as hell. I've had it for about a week, played it daily and barely got through half the game map..  You start off in this open patch of land at the forest entrance which is called The Knoxdale Forest.  Then there's this bridge with a Bigass Troll, then the Dark forest full of fricken Dogman creatures that always tear my ass up harder than a fresh fishs be’hind at San Quentin.  I haven't gotten past that yet, but I know there's more on that map once the gray areas open up.  Here goes nothin…..



(Video Game Console Startup sound)



“Welcome to the Land of Horrors, Do you think you have what it takes to survive?”



Was written on my face screen as the game started to load.



Once the font disappeared from my vision a small white circle appeared in the center of the pitch black space i was now in and the hole was slowly getting larger….and larger… The it got extremely bright, then my head started to burn and this loud electricity noise exploded in my ears and I grabbed my VR headset trying to pry them off with my hands but the damn shit wouldn't come off.  If i wasn't in so much agonizing pain I would have compared it to Carly Beth in Goosebumps where her dang Halloween mask wouldn't come off… But this was real… this was really happening, i'm getting fried like an egg in my own damn living room and there's no one even here to help me or call for help.   The noise kept buzzing, a mixture of an electrified fence with a bug zapper multiplied by 100 and that's what was ringing through my ears, and the pain I can't even explain how much that crap was hurting… again i felt like i was being fried!   ……  Then suddenly, my knees gave out and everything went completely black………

  


Chapter 2 - This is some Bullshit!



I woke up to a partly cloudy blue sky, the smell was of pine trees and earth. A rich musty aroma from decomposing leaves, twigs and many other matter on the ground…. I was laying on my back…..but where, where the hell was I?  I blinked a few times, shaking my head, feeling my ears and to my surprise, I felt no pain, no blood, nothing…  It was as if nothing had happened just moments ago in my living room. But I was no longer inside my living room, I was somewhere else…..but how?   I carefully stood up and scanned my new surroundings….  No… this can't be happening, this isn't real there's no freakin way, I must be dreaming…..what in the holy jingle bells is happening…. I must be trippin, but I hate mushrooms, so I scratched that out of the equation.



(Notification sound)



You are now in the land of Horror, do you have what it takes to survive, do you have what it takes to escape?



Read across my vision in computer text before disappearing after a few seconds.



I was not only in a game of some kind, but judging from the font read aloud to me, I also recognised this clear patch of land I was now in..   This was the beginning of that Escape Horrorland game I was playing….. No ficken way I said out loud to myself.  



HAHAHA Another Earthling I see…..  



A voice came somewhere nearby to my right just out of view.  I quickly turned and saw some old ass man in tattered clothing walking up to me with a smirk on his wrinkly frail face.   The man looked to be in his 70s at least!..... 



What the hell is going on here? How am I here and not in my apartment? This is some sick shit is this some kind of prank and who the hell are you old man?  I yelled out of fright and confusion.  ‘Settle down young man this is no prank, you are one of many who have been chosen to complete the quest of Horrors’  he said.  ""This is real, you are not imagining this, the same thing that you saw playing this video game is what you will now face head on in person, the only difference is now that if you die here you die for real”.   I was still trying to grasp my brain around all of this….. So what you're saying is that electrical malfunction somehow zapped me inside the fricken video game?  Are you off your rocker buddy? I screamed at him angrily.  “I'm afraid so, listen, there is no way to beat around the bush to explain this to you kid but you're in this video game, but inside here is their world, it's real for them.  They know nothing about our universe aside from us who have somehow been sent here to what I assume is to complete the game”.   

“Hmm well lad a 25 year old such as yourself might just have a chance as wrapping this place up.  As for me, I'm too old, I had no business even trying to play video games at my anyhow but with luck I have it here I am.’     

How did you know my age, I never told you, you some kind of mind reader too grandpa?

‘No I used ‘analize’ to see your basic profile information’  

How the hell do you do that?  How long have you been here?

“You simply concentrate on someone or something in this realm and it will show you, and as far as how long i've been here and why im still here… .well lets just say at my age kid I have not the strength or ability to protect myself against most of the creatures here.  I don't know how long I've been here, times are different and I didn't keep count”.  “Go ahead give it a try, analyze me son”

Shoot, I guess I really don't have anything to lose, I thought to myself.  If i'm really in this bitch i need to start thinking about what I do in this game and ‘man the hell up’ before some beast swallows my ass and craps me out.

‘Well son…. What is your name first of all?  Here in this realm I'd suggest using your gamertag name considering that your formal self doesn't exist here.  You can concentrate on your profile by simply ‘willing it’ and like that aside from other things that are done here in person compared to using a game controller.’

I'm no Noob, I said out loud and closed my profile display.  I noticed on the top right side of my vision to have a thin red bar which I could only assume to be my health bar just like in the game.  Ok, so far it's starting to make more sense to me.  So George, I asked.  Are there Health Herbs here to find and eat for healing like in the game, what about finding loot or other various items?

“Yes Kenjo, everything is just as it was in the game, you just have to concentrate or simply ‘will it’ and it will be”  he replied.  

“Here, I have stashed a few things i've found over my time here alone, I doubt ill be around for too much longer the way things have been going for me here so better I give it to someone who could actually put some use to it” George said.

I minimized the notifications and thanked George for not only his goods but also the little help of information of just everything in this beeyatch.   I put on the ring of health and automatically noticed my red health bar lengthen some across my screen. Then adding on the funky looking grayish brown chest plate armor and sheathing the sword from my belt I noticed that it's more like a short sword in my hands, which made sense as I'm human and goblins are little ugly ass green boogers with legs.  But it will have to do, I said to myself, better this than nothing but these brown peasant clothing I'm wearing and ugly as hell looking knock off Moccasins.

(Level Up Sound Effect)



Congratulations, you have advanced to Level 2.  Making allies and learning about new items and skills can help you not only level up faster by experience but also help you to stay alive.  Now stop being a lil bitch!



Noticing my Strength & Health went up by 30 points to a total of 230 and strength went up 10 points to 30, I closed the dialog and smiled…  



Come with me I said to George, there is power in numbers, you shouldn't be here all by yourself and now unarmed my conscience wouldn't feel right just leaving you here.

“Kenjo my boy, I am tired… I've been here for so long, and even back home on Earth I knew I was done not only mentally but physically.  Whatever happens, I've lived a good life, but I'm ready for my next journey when that path shows itself to me.

I understand, but that still doesn't mean I agree with you, but the choice is yours. Thanks again for everything, do you mind if I stay here with you through the night to gather my bearings before I hit the road tomorrow?



“Not at all I'm cooking up some Bunny Stew and you're more than welcome to accompany me around the fire. I can't say it is anything special but I find this area quite safe and quiet compared to the other areas I have traveled, you’ll be safe here for the night.  I do need some Mint Leaves if you don't mind finding some, they're randomly around and actually good for health so make sure you keep some with you for your journey.”



That's right Healing Herbs are found in this game, I guess he calls them Mint leaves, i just hope to god they at least taste half as good.  I've only had mint leaves in cucumber water than my old lady would make as some stupid detox crap she’ll do from time to time.  Never was too fond of it myself,  I just squeeze some lemon in the water and that's good enough for flavor for me.  It becomes French. I called it “Lem’Wa”.  I smiled remembering the good times back home, I also missed her Baoding Balls skills (bow’ding balls) ‘and i'm not talkin bout no Meditation!’  I giggled, as I searched the nearby brush for what George had called Mint Leaves. 



(Notification Sound Effect)



Congratulations!  You have uncovered “Health Herbs”, a minty smell & taste to which consumed gains you 10 extra points to your health.  



I grabbed some and put it up to my nose….yup definitely mint leaves, i took a nibble and to my utter surprise it tasted just like mint leaves back on Earth.  After spending some time scavenging the nearby brush areas around the clearing where George had set up camp for the night, I had a good supply for not only the supper for tonight but so for my own stash for tomorrow's journey to find a way out of this hell hole.  Once back at the campsite I gave him what was needed and sat beside the already roaring fire near a makeshift tent.  Bushcraft skills was something I had always loved watching on YouTube but I never tried doing it in real life before, or whatever my life was now called being here in Horrorland that is.  

“That tent space is for you” George said to me before I could ask him, ""I like to just stargaze myself but once you’re on your way you’ll have to decide how you prefer sleeping at night”.



…… Supper wasn't all that bad, my girl used to have two lop eared bunnies as pets back when we first moved in with each other but had to lock them up in their cages in the outside storage space on our patio due to their smell.  That definitely was no life for a bunny, or any animal pet in all honesty.  But they both died of old age; one went into the dumpster and the other we buried at her mothers house and by some magic of the Gods it started growing a tomato plant in the same spot we buried the 2nd bunny.  I don't know if her family ate those tomatoes or not, I don't even like tomatoes unless they're in salsa or cooked so it didn't matter to me one way or the other, but definitely brought back some memories eating the stew.  George and I had some casual small talk before hitting the hay, come to find out he is from California and he said the monsters here and the crime back home as different as they were weren't anything new to him.  

“I'm from a beach town called Oceanside in an area known by locals as The Deep Valley.  A lot of crime, murder and theft happens in that little area of mine.  I have been wanting to move away for years but I was only a year away from retirement at that time and thought it best to stick it out and wait until then and hit the road to a Red state”.

After that, we both said our goodnights and laid down for the night.  The next morning to my surprise George was gone, I mean completely vanished, no trace of anything that he had on him aside the the items he had given to me the day prior.  The early morning was cool with a light chill breeze that tickled my skin giving my arms goosebumps upon its touch.  The sky was cloudy but the sun was doing its best to fight off  the mist as best as it could and I gathered up my things into my pack, putting on the chest plate and sword on my belt.  Now, if I'm not mistaken, the game had a built in map showing everywhere you’d traveled will be lit up and the gray section areas of the map that you have yet to uncover.  I didn't know how in the hell I was supposed to find my map, I didn't have a fricken controller with me on this hellhole, but I took a wild guess that anything I wanted to check out whether it was my profile, stats, inventory, maps… All I needed to do was to ‘will’ it.   

I shrugged and concentrated, willing the map to be visible to me.

The map instantly popped up on my view, completely covering my vision.  I definitely didn't want to look at my map during a time of danger. That's for damn sure, I'd be slaughtered in a second if I ever made that mistake.  



(Notification sound effect)



Congratulations!  You have activated your map interface.  This is the map of Horrorland: The areas visible on your map are locations you have been to and the areas that are gray you have yet to discover. 



Seeing the small red icon circle at the bottom portion I can tell was myself still in the open clearing starting area near the edge of Knoxdale Forest.   There is a small dirt path leading around the forest North which connects to a bridge from memory playing the game days beforehand… which leads to The Dark Forest where I kept getting my ass kicked.  So I knew where I needed to go up until that point.   Willing the map interface to kick rocks, it minimized on my screen to a tiny icon at the far left corner of my vision.  Once that was settled, I started my trek along the dirt path in the hopes I don't run into anything life threatening, or at least something that I can at least handle.  I was definitely having my doubts as to how in the world am I going to finish this in one piece.  Even though that fear stuck to the back of my mind like grease on your fingers and trying to wash it off without any soap, I continued on down the path.

What I could only assume was mid day judging by the position of the sun in the sky, I knew I had a good 5-6 hours before dusk and would definitely want to find somewhere safe to sleep for the night.  While I walked along the trail of Knoxdale Forest I swear I could hear movement inside the foliage, the sounds of multiple things moving about, twigs snapping, cracking on the forest floor and through the thick brush inside those dark woods beyond my sight.  



The walk for the past couple of hours was semi pleasant, yes I was extremely paranoid about the woods around me but yet not actually seeing anything, I just kept my guard up and tried to make the best out of my walk.  I heard the scream of someone and the roar of something very not human somewhere further up ahead of me.  I stopped stunned and quickly hopped over behind the bush to my right hoping to have not been seen by whoever was making those noises up ahead.   I focused and tried to explain ‘’what  in the holy jungle bells of old Saint Nick's sack of goodies’ I was witnessing with my own two eyes?



At about 40 yards up ahead just right on this very same trail not only did I see the bridge entrance but also a battle to the death between what I very well knew to be a troll from the game.  Seeing this disgusting humanoid abomination in person was something else entirely though.  It was about 5 feet tall and as wide as that Blueberry girl from Willy Wonka movie.  It has grayish skin with a hint of green, so I slowly walked close through the brush to try to examine the situation better and see who this Troll was fighting with.     Once I had stealthily reached a safe hidden distance of about 20 feet away, assuming it was fighting another human that must have made the mistake of not being aware of their surroundings, I came to the realization that this creature was fighting against a Forest Elf.  This Elf was about half half its height, skinny yellowish pale skin, brown hair braided back like someone on the Vikings TV show on HBO with pointed ears and wore green armor. That Elf must be from Knoxdale I thought to myself. They're small yet mighty, and if you piss them off or try stealing from them or jacking up their woods they will definitely kick your ass. Aside from that,  they're actually quite cool in the game.  You can trade with them for all kinds of various items if you win them over or have something good to offer in trade or have enough coin.  



I focused my attention on the Troll and analyzed his Stats:

‘Trolls are nasty disgusting creatures that typically hide beneath bridges and out of sight from other creatures and races.  They are not intelligent creatures whose sole purpose is to feed and sleep.  Do not approach or try to conversate with this creature and it will surely try to kill and eat you right where you stand.’



Noticing his red health bar so low I could see that he was practically moments away from being beaten by the Forest Elf.  That's when I quickly analyzed The Elf:



Name: Wadell Bearclaw:  Protector of the Wilds

Race: Wood Elf

Level: 20

Strength: 40 

Damage: 60

Skills: Archery, short sword

Magic: Explosive Arrows

Reputation: Feared



A wood Elf is one who Dwells in the forests whose home is built high into the trees.  They aren't necessarily evil but mostly associate with nature rather than other creatures. They may be friends with humans but it is rare.  The Wood Elves are often mistaken by Fairies due to their small size and pointy ears and are known to be extremely stealthy and deadly with a bow and arrow.  What they lack in size they gain in distant combat.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* Due to my personality and desires, I could be considered part of the ace/aro spectrum. **I'm a lifelong demisexual who's becoming more demiromantic with age. In a digital/online context, I'm much more graysexual** due to it not requiring actual physical touch. I get along very well with people across this spectrum despite having sexual desires myself. If nothing else, we can have amazing conversations.
* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",2,1745549003.0,asexualdating,0,1.0,False

1k7abdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManagedByNarcissists/comments/1k7abdw/leave_if_you_can/,Leave if you can.,"About a year ago I was looking online for people who were going through the same thing I was at work and found this subreddit. I felt validated and commiserated with your stories.

I spent 7 months working with Nboss, but a little backstory first: I had been in the department for about 6 months before Nboss got hired. For my first 3 months we had a manager who was pretty laid back. Laid back manager left, and we spent the next 3 months without a direct supervisor. We were drowning, so when we found out a new manager was coming in who had extensive work experience in the field we were relieved. L. O. L. 

In the very beginning there were subtle red flags, but we gave Nboss the benefit of the doubt because we were in desperate need of a supervisor. After a few weeks, their true personality and character, or lack thereof, began to show. Thankfully, my co-workers and I were friends (still are), which made it easier to combat the divide and conquer tactic Nbosses love so much. But it was bad; two out of three co-workers ended up leaving the company entirely before I was able to quit. Unfortunately, I had to hit the 1-year mark to be able to apply to different departments within the company. 

I won't lie to you and say that I was counting down the seconds until 1 year was up. It was hard enough to land that job in the first place and after dealing with Nboss for 7 months, I was exhausted. And to be completely transparent, Nboss liked me so I didn't get the worst of their treatment, but I still endured their power trips and despised how they treated my co-workers. I'm also not naive to think the leopard wouldn't eat my face.

On a lovely Thursday afternoon on September 19th, Nboss's need to micromanage and overall bad behavior finally gave me the push I needed to clean up my resume. That same day I reached out to friends and applied to open positions on the company website. Mercifully, my search lasted only 2 weeks. The day after I was offered the new job, I was making coffee when Nboss came up to me with a shit-eating grin and their hand out for a pound saying “unexpected”, then walked away. Apparently, that same morning, Nboss’s boss had a serious conversation with them about why three people were quitting within the same month. 

I gave my official 1 month notice (company policy, don’t ask) the following day and Nboss acted like they couldn't care less. The following week Nboss couldn’t stand to even look at me and left me alone, but all good things must come to an end. The following Monday Nboss informed me they were able to negotiate with my hiring department to keep me for an extra 2 weeks.

Those next 5 weeks were hell. I had to train a new hire and Nboss tripled my work; often not coming into the office and telling me 15 minutes before a meeting that they wouldn't be able to attend and asking me to take lead when I had no idea with who it was or what it was about, giving me tasks I had never done before that had to be completed by end of business day, etc. I got through it out of spite, help from my more experienced co-worker, and seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. 

It has been almost half a year since I left, and I’ve come to know that Nboss received multiple HR complaints while being on probation for hostility, yet they’re still there terrorizing everyone.

All this to say that what everyone says here is true: the only way it will get better is by getting out and never looking back. 



Tldr: nboss was and still is awful. If you can leave, do it.





Note: the industry I'm in is very niche. If something doesn't make sense, apologies, but I'm not willing to go into more detail.

Note2: my partner read this before I posted and asked why he wasn't mentioned as the loving supportive boyfriend who was rooting for me the whole time (he was).",9,1745548597.0,ManagedByNarcissists,4,1.0,False

1k7a9ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1k7a9ox/kpop_concert_prices_in_the_us_are_insane/,K-Pop Concert Prices in the US are Insane,"I looked into buying tickets for Enhypen and $241 was the cheapest standard ticket upper bowl option. I already purchased tickets for j-hope, the rose, xdinary heroes, and ATEEZ so I was hoping to get something under $100 just to be in the building, but I’m not going to spend that much for nosebleeds. 

I think the bubble on concert ticketing prices for huge shows is about to pop- Beyoncé and Katy Perry aren’t selling out, and SM Town has sold a shockingly low number of seats considering their lineup. Everyone wants to immediately vilify Ticketmaster (and they deserve a ton of criticism for dynamic pricing and exorbitant fees), but artists (or the tour promoters they hired) are setting their ticket prices and allowing dynamic pricing. 

K-pop fans spend a lot of money on our favorite groups. We’re buying multiple physical and digital album versions, fan club memberships, light sticks, weverse content, merch, fan calls, pop-ups, award voting, coffee trucks, online concerts/videos, movie theater events, streaming content, send-offs (which needs to be a separate post on why we tolerate them stacking the fans), and buying and making concert freebies. Do they really have to sell a corner nosebleed at that price?

I understand the prices being a little higher- the shows typically have a high production value, but I’m sad to see them start to price out so many people, myself included because I think we all just want to go and see them. I’ve been to almost 100 concerts, and K-Pop is by far, the most expensive. I’m seeing a pop/rock show next week that cost me $35.

It came with the house, and I use it pretty heavily as a family of four that only eats out once a week. It's a basic stove, but honestly - I really like it and it has served me well so far. 

Well, today I went to make a cup of coffee, which I use the smaller back burners to do. When I hit the button to turn the back burner on, the front burner (big one) turned on as well. I shut it off, tried again and the same thing happened. I then turned on the front burner, but the back burner didn't turn on. It only happens on the left side (the right side has the variable sized burner, which works normally). 

Any idea what could be causing this? I'm guessing repairing a 12 year old isn't worth it. My two concerns with not replacing the stove: major - it's going to fail soon or could be indicative of other problems that make the machine as a whole unsafe. And of course, the lesser concern - a family member or friend (it's rare for other people to use it though) not realizing the problem and catching a cutting board or something else on fire. 

If your answer is I should replace it sooner rather than later: What would you get? (Gas is not an option for every reason). I really like that I don't need a backsplash with mine, but I'm willing to consider putting one in if the right unit needs it. ",1,1745548259.0,Appliances,1,1.0,False

Hi (34M). hope your having a good day cute reader. Just here to tell my history.

15, April. My fucking birthday. I hate that date. The day my awesome tragedy started. Lots of issues there. Thing is that day i was wasted as fuck going to the university (really easy stuff i do fine in terms of grades for a degenerate human like me). And i met whit my best friend (who is my love interest, fuck that shit i dont control that feeling and she knows what i feel), She look at my drunkass face and oh boy she got mad (i mean come on it was my fucking birthday and she knows is fucking sad for me to deal whit that date). 

  
""YOU HAVE TO GO TO REHABILITATION"" whit fire in her eyes. I can do it alone I told. ""NO, YOU FUCKING CANT"". She even text my mother hahaha (i gave her number in case of emergency, we are real good friends). 40 minutes of minutes of pure rages upon me, a somewhat of smart moneky shitface. We go to class later at 7:00 PM, things cool off, she gave me her presents.   
  
And i went to a friends house to keep drinking yeaahhhh Then i open my present and started to cry in front of the boyzz (no shame tho', long time alcoholic, no shame in crying, its a fucking routine!), she draw me a bird and a clay sculpture that i made but she did some crafty stuff whit fire and so on. I was moved by her.   


16, April. Had a test at the university that day. I wont drink i said to myself, and i have to look her again. I was feeling like shit. Was a test group, so i didnt have to write, shit that i could not do at the moment, my hands were shaking badly. The week before i invited this girl to watch a movie in my house after class and she told me ""Dont get confused"", we already talk about my feelings, we fucked a few times also but she didnt want a relationship, she broke up whit her excouple a few months ago. That day walking whit her back to the bus stop she accepted to come to my house. We watched a reeeeeal bad movie, so bad we have fun of how bad it was, and then we went to sleep (different beds).  


17, April. We woke up at the same time, around 10 AM, she started to tell me i cant fucking drink anymore, not as mad as before but slightly angry. She goes to her home. I sat drinking my coffee for 15 minutes. And guess what, yeah baby i had some beer left! BUM i open one of those godly cans, and just started drinking while watching the news. When i was at my second beer, she text me, ""I forgot my cellphone charger"". And there was i fucking souless. ""If she comes back, i am fucked, fuckity FUCK"".  
  
She didnt, was already on the bus on her way home. I started to feeling like a piece of shit. Oh we addicts are great for the poetry of lying and not giving a fuck. Well, i was giving some fucks this time. So i did what any sane dude would do. Call your cocaine addict and also alcoholic buddy! But this time was the final one (hahaha how many alcoholics say that to themself). I went to not sleep for al the snorting at 7:00 AM.

18, 19, 20 April. Living hell. Forcing me to eat. Wont get into details, i may have hallucinate some shit.

21, April. I get up of bed. Took a shower. And when i was drying myself, i was feeling... good? I started to cry like a river. I realize that... it was possible? IT WAS FUCKING POSSIBLE! Every time i remember that morning i get sentimental. I discovered the gift of my birthday (only person who gave something btw), wasnt the draw and the clay, was her fury (and that fucking illusion).   
  
Went to buy some paper and pencils to draw to do selfmade therapy stuff (and well she likes to draw, gotta show my artistic bullshit also). I was thinking ""lets reconnect whit my inner kid"" and that kind of crap when drawing. And i discovered, another shitty catch frase, i just found out the adult. When i was a kid and teen a drew alot, first Gokus and anime shit, then monsters from hell or space (no anime style), then futuristic cities and shitty achitecture type of things. Lets try some of that?

At that day i didnt draw before in like ten years whit the spirit to do so. Was difficult at first, then i gained confidence and just started to do introspective dark shit (and drunken kitties, got alot of drunken kitties). Didnt draw any of my kids drawing. It has helped alot.

Anyway, next day arent interesting really. Just not drinking and doing fine till now. (to be fair it will be 1 week sober tomorrow at 7 AM but) ONE WEEEEEK SOBEEEEEERR WHIT NO FUCK DOCTORS, NO FUCK PILLS, AND ALONE.

I’m a third year college student, Aerospace Engineering and physics as a second major. I tend to receive good grades and usually study hard. I pride myself in thoroughly knowing the material and putting in enough effort until I reach a deep thorough understanding. I also work over the weekends to afford rent and all other expenses. I have a boyfriend of four years  with whom I am moving in together in 3 months. 

Given the nature of my majors, my studying takes over all other areas, be it friends, spending time w boyfriend, seeing family, or even exercising and just taking care of myself and relaxing. I recognize the issue and actively attempt to combat the time management challenge by doing things like food prepping, making schedules, studying with breaks, planning etc. I use google calendar to plan study times, I have set up my day in such a way where I should always study from 8am to 5-6 pm, and my evenings should be free. However, what ends up happening every single semester is that at some point things snowball, I don’t sleep well one night, then I push studying for later, then I scroll for an hour, and I find myself having to pull an all-nighter just to complete all my work. Afterwards it takes a few days, even a week sometimes to just get myself back into the groove, and most of the time I am continuously behind on learning the material. 

 This kind of lifestyle obviously affects my mental state, it disrupts my sleep and I occasionally lash out at my boyfriend, which I do not pride myself in. This intensifies when exams are approaching, meaning right now, because finals are in a week. 

All of that said, I recognize that I am very good at setting up support systems for myself, such as prepping meals ahead and freezing them for days when I can’t cook, and planning my studying ahead. However, I seem terrible at sticking by those plans, be it because I feel like I don’t have a social life and I stay up until 3am scrolling, or be it because an assignment turns out more time consuming than I thought. I recognize that I lack discipline that would keep me in line, not allowing for such things to happen. At this point I don’t think pure motivation will do it, so I am looking for literature that would help develop self-discipline. I am a firm believer that discipline is what gives you freedom, now I just need to implement it haha. So please recommend books/authors that might have useful ideas, tips, or just your own experience with overcoming this snowballing issue, when everything gets knocked out of schedule, and you’re a stressed mess that can’t put themselves back into structure.  

Another important aspect - I find it difficult to study in specific places. I have a desk set up in my bedroom, and sometimes I am very productive here. Other times my bedroom is too relaxing and I end up procrastinating. I’ve tried to study on campus, but I am a snob about noise, so anytime people around me talk/eat I get annoyed ( not proud of that either). I also tend to feel restricted when studying on campus. Coffee shops are off the table due to the noise issue. I am especially concerned about being able to focus at home, given that I’m moving in with bf soon, and studying at home then just seems impossible bc we always talk/hang out.  

So if you know how to develop a mental connection between a specific place and a state of mind, please share that as well. 
All ideas and input is appreciated, criticisms included.

I’ve been having a lot of the symptoms of ALS and finally was able to see my doctor who wants to go the “let’s rule out everything else” route.  I assume that is standard but my concern is that I am in a pretty steep decline. I went from “normal” to nearly unable to live by myself in 4 mos. At this rate I could require assisted living in 2025. 

Doctor wants to first rule out a pinched nerve, then maybe refer me to a neurologist. Meanwhile I can barely lift a coffee cup (split hand, split elbow) and I am twitching and cramping all the time. I’m assume it’s just their process as she said the neurologist would reject the referral absent ruling out these alternatives. 

My question to the sub: is there any benefit to me trying to move things along more quickly? If there’s no effective treatment, should I just relax and let them go through their process of excluding everything else since I’m not losing time or anything. If I had the diagnosis I might organize my life differently (quickly organized family trip, maybe find assisted living spot) but if it makes no medical difference maybe I can be at peace letting it play out slowly.

The biggest issue is that he doesn’t know how to behave in a relationship or how to set priorities, and because of that, he comes across as immature and childish. For example, he allowed his male friend to share his bed, supposedly just until the friend ""figures things out,"" which was supposed to be for a few months. The friend is still there, sleeping in my boyfriend’s bed, and even brings his girlfriend over—apparently, she has no problem laying in a bed that another man besides her boyfriend sleeps in.

I work and study, and it would be easier for us to spend time at his place (because of the distance), but that’s not possible because of his friend, so we mostly see each other in cafés. As a result, we don’t get to spend real quality time together or have deep conversations. My apartment is even farther, so we’d definitely see each other more often if he had his own room. He hasn’t said anything to his roommate and doesn’t plan to—not even to point out that maybe it’s not okay for the roommate’s girlfriend to be coming over when his girlfriend doesn’t. The same rules should apply to everyone.
By sharing the bed, he saves around 120 euros a month, but it’s not like he’s using that money wisely—he drinks up to 3 coffees a day with friends and colleagues and orders stuff from Amazon.

I also think that he doesn’t understand or know how to establish healthy boundaries with his best female friend. He has shared some of my intimate issues from my past relationship with her because he wanted a “female perspective”—as if he needed another woman to validate that my feelings were real, like I wasn’t enough on my own.

Also, when he visited the said friend with a group of people, he couldn’t talk to me on the phone because she was hiding behind him and eavesdropping. She apparently thinks that kind of behavior is cute or funny. Also, her Instagram is full of provocative pictures, and her bio literally says “the goal justifies the means.” Recently, she called him at 11 PM asking him to take a walk around the city. I got upset because I feel it’s disrespectful for my boyfriend to go on casual night walks with a girl who isn’t me. It just made me so insecure, you just don't do that in relationships. It made me feel like my boundaries don't matter and I started feeling like I couldn't trust him with my heart. Not because he is going to cheat but because he does things so nonchalantly, not thinking about me in the process.

A few days ago, I was seriously ill, barely able to get out of bed, and he came to help out and just be there for me. Suddenly, around 2 PM, he told me he’d leave for a bit to see his best female friend in town and then come back. This really hurt me because he knows he can rely on me—I’ve taken care of him when he wasn’t well, I've let him sleep at my place while he wasn't feeling well bc there are too many people in his. I cooked and went to get groceries, his meds, I did everything I could to make sure he recovers. It never even crossed my mind to meet up with anyone else, let alone someone who makes him feel insecure.

At that point, I was ready to break up, because he keeps making the same mistakes. I keep explaining that we need to set boundaries and communicate, but he ends up doing what he wants and I end up in tears. He eventually calmed me down, and we agreed that I would meet his friend the next time they hang out (he had suggested that before, but I’m an introvert and had already met many of his friends, so I needed some time to adjust.)

The next day, he went to work so we didn’t talk much, but he still found time to ask if I’d like us all to meet in a few days. Maybe I’m too sensitive, but even that hurt. After all the crying and explaining, after a sleepless night, he thinks I’m just ready to meet her—as if it’s more important for him to be fair and fulfill his promise to her than to understand me for once, to see that I’m hurting, and not expect me to meet her immediately.

There were other situations too—like when he got upset because I didn’t want to get into the car with his male friend group and go for a ride. I wasn’t aware we’d be driving, and I was raised to be cautious as a woman. There was a misunderstanding, but instead of trying to understand why I felt uncomfortable riding with people I don’t know, he got mad at me because I said I'd prefer to stay home instead and then ignored me for 6 hours. For someone who values communication deeply, I realized this was his way of punishing me.

I don’t think he understands that he’s no longer single, that he’s in a relationship now and that  priorities change. I feel like his life is going on and passing me by and he invites me in when he has time and when he is bored. He also knows he can depend on me and uses it, but as soon as I'm not needed anymore I'm not a priority anymore. 

There are more situations like these, I just wrote a few so you understand my point.

I really don't know what to do. Thank you for reading

Just peace. It felt suspicious, but I decided to ride the wave.

A friend texts: “Brunch?”  
And I’m like, “Heck yeah, I deserve nice things.”

I get there, order super safe: eggs, toast, maybe a tiny bite of hash brown. No dairy, no grease bomb, no weird sauces. I was basically a food monk. Everything seems chill... for the first 10 minutes.

Then my gut does *that* little churn. You know the one. The “you’ve got maybe 15 minutes before the chaos begins” churn.

Suddenly, I’m not listening to my friends. I’m scanning for exits, locating the bathrooms, planning a fake phone call to excuse myself. Why is every nice cafe bathroom always hidden like it’s some sort of escape room?

Twenty minutes in, I’m walking briskly—not quite running, but *speedy*—like someone who remembered they left the stove on. I swear I almost knocked over a stroller on my way out. Got home just in time to realize... this was a full-body betrayal.

The worst part? I *really* thought I was in the clear this morning. I trusted my gut and it played me like a fiddle.

Do any of you actually go out to eat with confidence? Or is it always like this—strategizing your route, packing “emergency gear,” and pretending you’re not living in low-level dread every time someone says “let’s go out”? 😂",1,1745547780.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

**Who Is Jon Sinn and What’s the “Effortless Conversation System” All About?**  
So, let’s cut to it—*Effortless Conversation System - Jon Sinn* is a deep dive into mastering conversations with women. Jon Sinn, a well-known name in the dating and pickup community, created this program to help guys level up their game when it comes to talking to women naturally, confidently, and—yep—effortlessly. It's not about memorizing cringey one-liners. It’s about developing real flow in conversations that spark genuine connection and attraction.

**Why Does Conversation Even Matter?**  
Think about it—everything in dating starts with a convo. Whether you're saying hi in line at a coffee shop or chatting on a first date, your words (and how you say them) make all the difference. The *Effortless Conversation System - Jon Sinn* shows you how to never run out of things to say, kill awkward silences, and create those “OMG, I feel like I’ve known you forever” vibes. Because let’s be honest, awkward small talk just ain’t it.

**What’s Inside This Program? (Hint: It’s More Than Just Talk)**  
Inside the course, you’re getting the full works: a training video, an MP3 audio version, and a workbook so you can practice and reflect on what you’re learning. Jon lays out his exact system—including go-to topics, routines, and mindset hacks—that he’s used to build instant connections with strangers. You’ll also learn his 3 magic conversation topics that are basically foolproof for keeping things fun and flowing.

**Where Can You Use These Skills?**  
Honestly? Anywhere. That’s the beauty of the *Effortless Conversation System - Jon Sinn*. Whether you’re at a party, on a date, or just making small talk in an Uber, these techniques help you speak with more ease and confidence. It’s not limited to bars and clubs—it’s for real-world, everyday situations too. You’re learning how to become that guy who’s just naturally good with people.

**Who Is This For (Besides the Obvious)?**  
Sure, it’s aimed at guys who want to get better with women, but it’s also for anyone who struggles with conversation flow. If you freeze up, feel anxious about keeping a chat going, or wish you could just be smoother, this system is for you. Jon breaks it down so even total beginners can follow it. No flashy gimmicks—just solid, usable tools.

**When Will You See Results?**  
That depends on how you apply it. But since the course comes with actionable steps and daily conversation practice routines, most guys start seeing a noticeable improvement in a week or two. It’s not magic—it’s repetition and using what works. The system is designed to build real-world confidence fast.

**How Does It All Work (Without Feeling Fake)?**  
Here’s the cool part—*Effortless Conversation System - Jon Sinn* isn’t about putting on a show. It’s built around being authentic, playful, and present in your interactions. You’re not learning scripts—you’re learning structure and flow. So instead of overthinking what to say next, you just *get it*. That’s where the “effortless” part really kicks in.

**Final Thoughts – Worth Checking Out?**  
If you’ve ever felt stuck in boring convos or awkward silences, this is a legit fix. *Effortless Conversation System - Jon Sinn* gives you the conversational playbook that helps you connect fast, be more likable, and keep the attraction alive. It’s straight-up gold for any guy who wants to upgrade his dating life—no weird pickup artist vibes necessary. Just smoother talks and better results.",1,1745547780.0,RazanStudying,1,1.0,False

1k79y5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Landlord/comments/1k79y5j/tenant_usany_lease_renewal_and_rent_increase/,[Tenant - USA/NY] Lease Renewal and Rent Increase,"We rent an apartment from a company that has several residential and commercial properties in the area. I understand they are a business and housing is a commodity. As a landlord, that seem to be decent company to deal with and the property we rent at is older (1960's) and has some issues that come with older buildings but, in general, we've had no problems. Our biggest issue is with the water, they actually have to have it tested and it usually fails for too much mineral content. It comes from a well and is pretty much undrinkable so we buy bottled water for drinking and making coffee. 

Our fifth renewal is coming up and, the inevitable, rent increase which always brings about questions in my mind. 
How do landlords calculate ""market rate""?
If nothing changes with the property (no added amenities, nothing updated) what's a fair increase? 
With the water issue, how would they compare this complex with others in the town that are on town water and have no such issues?

☕ [Tip Jar](https://buymeacoffee.com/oldbublysoul29) I enjoy doing these weekly posts & hope that others have found them to be resourceful. If you would like to toss a coin or two (thanks in advance!!), I’ve set up a Buy Me a Coffee page. Never expected, always appreciated ❣️ (P.S. if you’re having trouble getting to the “checkout” page, you might need to turn off content blockers on your phone.)",4,1745547321.0,Minneapolis,0,0.83,False
1k79whx,https://i.redd.it/3p93p4oz3wwe1.jpeg,Do I pass when I look like crap?,"I'm at a really nice children's hospital having a terrible time, and the barista just put an obscure masculine version of my name on my coffee order. Could be nothing, and I'm just being sensitive... Or I might not pass when I'm sleep deprived and puffy-faced. And I'd like to know. Thanks in advance to everyone except the trolls!",5,1745547310.0,transpassing,5,1.0,False
