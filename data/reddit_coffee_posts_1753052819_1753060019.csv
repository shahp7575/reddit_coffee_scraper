1m55fgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/philmont/comments/1m55fgg/itinerary_79_notes/,Itinerary 7-9 notes,"Here are my notes from 7-9, a 7 day strenuous itinerary.  Our crew started on trail 7/10.

Day 2 (first day in trail).   
Conservation (Cito Creek) do it if you are offered.  You will have a few scouts in waders in waist deep water, and will be building beaver dams.  It was fun and we felt like we accomplished something.  Also, this gave us more time for sleep and program later in the trek.

Day 2 Zastrow to Old Abreu
We took the road.  Supposedly there is a trail (according to the Backcountry staff, who gently admonished is that we should have taken it), and the map does show a ""flagged trail"" but our Ranger didn't know what that was, so said not to take it.  This might be worth discussing with logistics -- I read somewhere that flagged routes just mean they are not fully developed, and marked with ribbon, and are only recommended when no other route exists, as in this case.  

We probably spent too much time at Abreu when we got there -- drinking sasparilla and doing the pickle challenge.  (If your scout does the pickle challenge, they should take off their jacket, as they will probably lose some to the ground)

It would have been better to get to camp, get set up, then come back for advisor coffee and cantina time.

We didn't fill up in the creek, we just filled water the next day back at Abreu.  Keep in mind if you DO fill up water in the creek, you will need to pick up extra micropur at the resupply later, since you need almost all 100 tablets once you get to Black Mountain.

Day 3:  Old Abreu to Crater Lake
Our first morning, it took our crew a long time to get going, so we arrived at Crater Lake fairly late, so got the late slot for spar pole, and then never had time for the other wood chopping program.   Rain rolled in around 3pm, it was interesting watching our boys at the top of the tallest pole while hearing thunder..... 
I suggest advising the crew before the trek that program slots fill up, and they should aim to arrive at camps by 1pm.  We didn't figure that out until second or third day in trail, and finally scouts assigned a taskmaster to wake everyone up and yell out times to be out of tent, have tents down, etc 
.   
The hike to Crater is pretty.  We stopped around Aguilla for an extended break.   A mama bear and baby bears were sighted by some rangers near Bear Caves / Aguilla.   

Crater Lake campfire was the favorite of our boys.  The latrine is ...  interesting ... Bring a bandana or something to mark the trail as ""occupied"".  Many of our boys decided to wait and use the RRI instead, which wasted a lot of time the next morning.

Day 4: crater lake to Beaubien 
Leaving Crater Lake, we got an early start, but then spent an hour doing water fill ups and Red Roof runs.   Which wasn't great, because Beaubien hike is long.  We went over Trail Peak.  It isn't as bad as it looks, if you've done your training.  We made good time up the hill -- it is nice and shaded, and very pleasant even though steep.     However, we took way too much time at the peak, then at B24.  We did our wilderness pledge at peak, had some snacks, and generally just lazed about.   Apparently there is a place you can get a view, which we missed.  Best to do a short stop at peak, then go check out B24 (again for short time) and press on.  It wasn't obvious from Gaia, but fairly obvious on the sectional, that at the bottom of the hill, you cross over the Bonita road to Beaubien onto a trail through the meadow, which then enters the forest and you reach Beaubien from the southwest, not the east on the road.  We got stuck in a hailstorm in that section.

We didn't arrive in Beaubien until around 3pm due to our long wait at Trail Peak.  But the time we had our porch talk, and cleared out our packs, it was 4pm.    The resupply run to Phillips took us 45 minutes down, 45 up, plus a while counting the bags...   It would be better to arrive at Beaubien by 1-2 to ensure time to have whole crew go to Phillips.   Instead, we had to send a small crew of 4, since you must provide scouts at 4:30 for Chuckwagon, and everyone needs to be back by 5...   our 4 booked it down and up, and made it just in time for seconds. Don't do what we did -- get the Beaubien before 2.

Don't forget to resupply your water tabs if you used them at Abreu, you will basically need 100 tabs once you get to Black Mountain + Schaefer's.  Also don't forget to refill toilet paper!  Also tortillas.   Phillips is your last chance to refill.  We only picked up one TP roll, then had to carefully ration on our last day.

The campfire was good here.  This was also the coldest night.  In fact, it was the only night I fully strapped in my quilt, and wore layers at night.

Day 5: Beaubien to Black Mountain 
Since we did Cons on Day 2,  we had time for a late awake at Beaubien, lazily packed up by 8,  and did roping 8-9, showers 9-9:30.  If you had to do Cons this day, you'd have to have showered the previous evening.

Note that if you do laundry in the AM, it might not dry by evening since you are hiking.  There are wash basins by the showers -- it would have been better to do laundry in evening, and leave to dry in sun in evening and morn.  I did my laundry (mainly underwear), squeezed it out really well, and hung it in a line for an hour, and it was dry enough. Others tried to wash pants or shirts, and they didn't dry for the remainder of the trip!

Beaubien to Black Mountain is a nice hike.  Again, because we did Cons early, this time we got to Black Mountain around 1.  They have slots every hour until I think 5 for musket and blacksmithing.   Most crews didn't get to musket until the morning because they got in after 3pm, ao maybe had to do it the next AM.
 
This was my favorite camp, very rustic feel.  Ask for the cabin tour.  Check out the power outlet in the log ;) The campfire here was very intimate and laid back. We did our musket shooting kind of late, which didn't leave much time to get dinner + clean up by the 7:30 mountain ball, which our boys ended up missing.

Day 6: Black Mountain to Shaefers via Urraca
The hike from Black Mountain to North Fork was very pleasant.  Yes there are thousands of creek crossings, but easy to keep feet dry, and it was shady and all downhill.  I believe it took just under 3 hours to get to Urraca (~5 mi), which is what we heard from some other crews as well 

I know many people recommend doing dinner for lunch.  But that also means you have to do low impact sump method.  There is no sump at Urraca. Our crew of 12 we realized that we could each just carry an extra 0.5 L and could cook at camp without having to rush (since we could have ppl setting up tents, fly, and bear bags while cooking crew cooked), and I think that ended up being a good decision..  So we each carried 6-7L from urraca, enough for rest of day, dinner, and 4L for next day.   So we had lunch for lunch at North Fork, and got to Shaefers by 1pm or so.   There is a great overlook at 
495667 4034044, that we checked out after setting up camp, before dinner.
(Take the trail past campsite 8/9, take a left, then take another left, and there is foot trail to the right.  Gaia shows an overlook and unmarked trail at 495589 4033923 but there was no way to get to it)
Looking North from this overlook we could see some peaks in Colorado, 65 miles away!

We didn't have a campfire here (worried about water carry), but some nice conversation around the ""campfire"" -- something we really hadnt had a chance to do with campfire programs at every other camp except Abreu.  A very chill evening,

Day 7: Shaefers to Base Camp
The advice to leave Shaefers early and try to hit the peak by sunrise is good advice.  We didn't.  The first place you can get a sunrise view on the trail is about an 45 minutes up the trail, the peak is a bit further, so plan accordingly.  We hit trail at 5:30, it would have been better to start walking at 5.

Shaefers Peak is worth it, but don't spent too much time.  For Tooth of Time you will want to drop packs, it is a scramble up boulders.  There ARE bear lines at the base of the Tooth of Time, as logistics mentions-- though it seems like many if not all crews just drop their packs and say screw it.   If you are at the clearing at base of the tooth,with your back to the tooth. The bear lines are on the right, maybe 100 ft diagonal forward/right -- we didn't see them when we dropped packs, and hauled our smellables up the tooth, which I wouldn't recommend.  The base of the tooth is a good open spot for lunch, it was pretty inconvenient to try to eat at the tooth, and the minibears were out in force when we were taking photos.

After the tooth, there are latrines at tooth ridge camp -- be sure to look closely at the map, the latrines are behind large piles of sticks/brush, a bit hard to find at first.   There are also some cool rocks and caves to explore, though technically you should stay out of the caves (our boys went into the cave, found a bat!).  Then the long slog downhill.  It actually went pretty quick, our crew basically stopped taking water breaks they were motivated to get back to Basecamp, we were going > 2 mph.   

Overall, this was a great trek.

Anyway, I can't name you here so I'll just call you my babylove hehe. I’ve been wondering what you’re up to. I haven’t seen or heard anything from you, even if I was the one who left you on read. But just know that it’s not intentional. I’m sorry if it’s taking too long for me to reply to your messages. I'm not okay lately, but don't worry kahit wala ka namang pake about it, I’ll answer all your messages. I’m still gathering my thoughts because I’m running out of words. You’re really good at conversations, and I’ve been trying to keep up with you— please bear with me. I’m not being distant; I’m just taking my time. We’ll talk about coffee and matcha ulit (buti na lang naimbento sila sa mundo para may mapag usapan tayo haha)

It’s funny because I’ve actually been wondering if you’re already married or if you’re having a baby HAHAHAHAHAHA jokes aside but that’s how stupid my brain works— but yeah, maybe you're just busy or.. having a hard time with some stuff?? I dunno, because even if I ask, you would just say na ""okay lang"", which is fine kasi ano nga naman pwede mong isagot if wala naman talagang ganap sayo. Gusto ko lang malaman mo na I'm checking on you, kahit di mo alam. Even if hindi mo maramdaman yung existence ko— yes, not my presence, kasi bukod sa we're not together.. I feel like we’re on a different timeline HAHAHAHAHAHAHA — as if there’s a huge barrier between us. Still, I’m letting you know I’m just here. I don’t mean I’m waiting for something to happen or waiting for you. I’m not hoping for anything. I know our connection might be temporary, and you might forget it happened and didn’t even bother to think about it. Pero ako, I promise not to forget about you— even if I don’t leave a promise, I know I won’t. I’ll treat you the same way; if our last meeting was the last time, and then we meet somewhere or bump into each other after so many years, I would still say hello.

This is not a goodbye letter nor a confession— don’t worry haha. The weather is just making me sad, and I’m just letting it out. I keep thinking about you every damn time and I can’t help it— so I’m writing about it. Writing and listening to music have become my way of expressing my feelings and thoughts about you— and tbh, I even made a playlist about you (which is hidden, for sure). Your name… ‘twas spelt out there. It only consists of 5 songs, about 20 minutes long, and in the initials of each song, it’s there.

Yes, this is me thinking I’m loving pink now!! And I’m not going to do anything about it. I’ll just stay stagnant, man!! That’s how I should behave. I should know my place.

You said we’re friends, and I’m happy that you see me that way— I’m already grateful for that. I don’t want anything more than that. I obviously admire you, but our connection… it has to be platonic. It has to be wholesome. My intention has to be pure. I’m not going to cross the line or break the boundaries. Don’t make me do the bad thing.

It’s totally fine if we’re not on the same page— The feeling doesn’t have to be mutual— because the closer you get, the more it scares me, but don’t get me wrong. I truly appreciate everything you do, for making me feel good about myself, for making me feel seen and heard, and I should thank you for being so nice to me— for being so responsive and expressive around me. Don’t worry, I’m not going to take advantage of that.


I’d rather stay friends with you— just so I can keep you.

heres some of the written stuff on the website. 

Reflecting on the days before Amy’s disappearance, Amy’s mother, Iva Bradley, recalls several members of the crew paying special attention to Amy from the moment they boarded the ship. The day preceding Amy’s disappearance, Amy’s parents were approached by a waiter who asked for Amy by name. The waiter said ‘they’ wanted to take Amy to Carlos and Charlie’s Restaurant while docked in Aruba. Her father recalls thinking the waiter’s request was uncomfortably forward. A short time later, Ron and Iva told their daughter what happened. Both parents are now haunted by Amy’s response, “I wouldn’t go and do anything with any of those crew members. They give me the creeps.”

Creepy didn’t stop there. Later that night, the family attended a party on the upper deck where the band was playing. During the party, Amy, accompanied by her mother, went to the 4th deck photo gallery to view pictures of vacationers that had been taken earlier in the evening. All of the photographs taken of Amy were missing. When they asked the gallery manager where the photos were, he stated he remembered developing them and placing them with the others but was unable to locate them. Iva then asked the photo gallery manager to re-make the photos.

“There was a dance troupe that was allowed onboard the ship,” Iva continues. “There was a bass player who I noticed. And he was a very unsavory looking character. Amy told her brother, Brad, that the bass player had been hitting on her. She said that he was a real jerk.”

Iva and Amy attended an art auction on Sunday, March 22nd. It was in the open area of the ship. Several times during the auction, Iva looked to the levels above them. A man was leaning on the railing intently watching Amy each time Iva looked up. Amy also noticed this man and mentioned it to Iva. It continued for about an hour, until Iva finally stood up and waved her arms at the man. Iva described the man as Middle-Eastern in appearance and she definitely thinks he was involved with Amy’s disappearance. He reminded Iva of a young Sadam Hussein.

Iva bought a modernist serigraph of a blond woman sitting in a chair, to hang on the wall of Amy's apartment. It's still rolled in its brown cardboard tube

On ‘America’s Most Wanted’, the F.B.I. stated they found no reason for Amy to leave her family or cause harm to herself.  Amy took 15 rolls of film with her to make a collage for her coffee table.  While in Aruba, she bought presents for her friends back home and also sent postcards from Puerto Rico to her friends – On one postcard, she wrote, “Hey Girl, it’s gorgeous here.  We leave for Aruba tomorrow!  Take care, tell Madison and Niles hello.  I’ll be home Sat. at 10:00.  See ya, Amy.”

On another, she wrote, “Hey, it’s beautiful here. Old San Juan has got some amazing buildings. I am taking pictures. Maybe you can see them at Easter?  Wish you were here.  Amy.''

She is incredibly irritable and cries often. I see her once a week, for instance, and she has cried almost every week in the last few months. She has been on the medication for over a year now. 

At first it seemed as if it was working great, but now it feels more and more like she's a raw nerve. She's acting impulsively (quitting her job one day, asking for it back the next), cutting my sister out of her life, earlier today she came over and then left upset that my son didn't want to ride in her car but wanted to take mine instead and she said it's wasteful to take two cars, I'll just see you next week.  Which I would accept as just a personal prefernce, except it feels like it's about control. 

She was definitely a doormat before, and could have used to be a little more assertive. And I do think it's helped her revise her relationship with food. But that too feels very controlling. She only eats a handful of things now -- brocolli, pesto, nuts, jerky, coffee, string cheese. Very little else. She says she doesn't trust herself with other foods. That sort of thinking sounds like something I would want my medication to help me smooth out.

I am geniunely worried this is a bad fit for her. I too took Wellbutrin before I started Celexa, and it made me incredibly irritable as well, so it's possible I'm biased. Has anyone known someone who had a similar experience?  ",1,1753059251.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

I’m staying at a cottage resort in Canada and honestly, I’m pretty frustrated. I’ve actually been here before, back when it was under different ownership, and it was great. Everything worked, the place was clean and well-kept, and communication was never a problem. This time around, it’s like a completely different place, and not in a good way.

Pretty much everything is broken or missing. The dock is damaged, the boats are unusable, the playground is falling apart, and the “games room” is just an empty building. The “fully equipped kitchen” had one fork, one knife, one spoon, one cup, one pot, and one pan. No toaster, no coffee maker, not even a broom. The grass hasn’t been cut at all, and multiple things they advertised online just aren’t here anymore.

So I went to talk to someone about it. The first worker I found didn’t speak any English. I tried again with three other staff members, and they all only spoke Russian. I used Google Translate to try to explain, and it got tense quickly.

Then one of them told me I wasn’t allowed to flush toilet paper and needed to throw it in the garbage because of a septic tank. I live in a rural area and have a septic system myself. That’s not how a properly working one should operate. If your system can’t handle toilet paper, there’s something wrong with it.

At that point I said, “If you’re running a resort in Canada, you should have at least one staff member who can speak English fluently.” She got angry and walked away. Later on, another guest told me the staff were saying I was rude and entitled.

So now I’m wondering, AITA for saying that? I honestly tried to be respectful and patient, but the place has gone completely downhill, and I feel like I’m being treated as the problem just for pointing it out.",1,1753059191.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Table #1 has only 1 occupant. She is dressed in a T-shirt, sweatpants, earrings, and flip-flops.

From what he can over hear from her phone call, he can make out that her last name is (von) Württemberg and that her first and middle names have ties to Austrian/German royalty AND have a modern twist to them. Her order is a turkey sandwich and an espresso with a bit of sugar in it.

Table #2 is occupied by a set of identical twin boys with dark brown hair and hazel eyes. Their last name is exactly 6 letters long. The one on the left side of the table, who ordered a lemonade and a cookie, has a first name related to 80s rock music and a middle name with a nature theme. The one on the right side of the table, who only ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, also has a nature-themed middle name, however, his first name is color-themed.

Table #3 is occupied by a couple on a date. They each ordered a brownie and a seltzer water. The female member of the couple, who is descended from Italian royalty, has a last name that reflects that. Her first name is Alessia and her middle name is related to Italian Eurovision/Italian Eurovision singers. The male member of the couple is Hispanic. His first, middle, AND last names all have the same/similar pronunciations in Spanish and in English.

Table #4's sole occupant is a woman scrolling through Instagram as she waits for her cookie and bubble tea. Her first name is related to video games and her middle name is gender neutral. Her last name is Kaufman.

The one of the right side, who is slowly drinking her iced tea before eating her cinnamon roll, has a first name that was popular in the 1990s, a gender neutral middle name, and a last name with a nature theme.

Table #6 also has only 1 occupant. He's eagerly giggling over some sort of YouTube video as he waits for his cupcake to finish baking. His first name is related to musical theater, his middle name is James, and his last name has exactly 8 letters in it.

How do I become uncooked?,"Hi everyone, I am a rising junior (graduating 2027) with a 3.13 GPA and no internship experiences yet. I had no luck during the 2025 recruiting season, but this summer I’ve been taking 9 credit hours of classes to make up for it. I won’t be graduating with 150 credits and plan to take easy CC classes while working and studying for the CPA. The only relevant experience on my resume is being Treasurer for a large cultural organization at my school (which feels like a full time job to me and takes up a lot of my time) and doing very minimal expense tracking for my dad’s farm. 

I heard from a recruiter at a Top 10 firm that most firms including B4 have pretty much filled up their Summer 2026 internship slots. I’ve been cold emailing and messaging recruiters all summer with pretty much the same answers. I’m worried that I missed the hiring window, as I was really hoping to secure a Big 4 internship since the exit opportunities are seemingly better and higher pay if you have B4 experience on your resume. I know they will open up more positions in the fall, but I’m worried that my competition will beat me to them since I have a less than ideal GPA and no internships as a junior. I keep seeing posts of people with degrees struggling to find entry level jobs and it kind of scares me for the future since I’m anticipating an economic downturn by the time I graduate in 2 years. 

This summer I am focusing on getting my GPA up, networking wherever I can (mostly cold messaging on LinkedIn), and applying for the few open positions I find on Handshake. I’m gunning for audit internships since I want to switch to advisory after a few years, but advisory internships are competitive and I think having audit experience will lay a strong foundation for me.

Next semester I’ll still be focusing on getting the GPA up (taking 18 credit hours), but also making more measurable impacts as Treasurer (It’s very likely I will be President my senior year, but I’m willing to give that up if it will interfere with my GPA or career opportunities since it is very time consuming, and I will have an insanely hard course load my senior year). Joining a business club (either the Accounting Society or a Women in Business one), and going to like every career fair. I also have a potential coffee chat lined up with a Principal from a B4 in the state I go to school in. (I am an out-of-state student and want an internship in my home city, don’t know if that will hurt me or not) 

Doing all of what I just listed above at once is very daunting to me and I’m also worried that splitting my energy across all of these will become like a “jack of all trades, master of none” situation, so if anyone has any advice on what areas to focus my energy, please let me know!!

1m556kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/globalinvestorlife/comments/1m556kg/3_best_places_to_bank_right_now/,3 best places to bank right now...,"The Only 3 Places Worth Living in Southeast Asia (And Why They Beat the Rest)



Southeast Asia is full of expats chasing freedom, low cost of living, and adventure. But let’s be honest — not every country in the region lives up to the hype. If you’re serious about geo-arbitrage, lifestyle perks, and long-term opportunity, the real contenders come down to just three: Philippines, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Here’s why these should be on your radar if you’re living the nomad or expat life.



1. Philippines: The Best for Community and English Proficiency

The Philippines stands apart in Southeast Asia for one massive reason — everyone speaks English. Whether you’re dealing with real estate agents, starting a business, or making friends, you’ll never feel lost in translation. Communication ease is an underrated but critical factor for long-term relocation.



Second, it’s a social paradise. Filipinos are naturally friendly, open to foreigners, and have strong ties to Western culture — especially American. Whether in Manila, Cebu, or Davao, you’ll find social circles, expat communities, and even dating much more accessible than in neighboring countries.



Third, strategic location. The Philippines’ proximity to Taiwan, Japan, and Singapore makes it a useful base for travel and even offshore business. Plus, special visa programs like SRRV make retirement or investment immigration relatively simple.



2. Cambodia: The Ultimate Easy Entry and Low Tax Jurisdiction

Cambodia is the freest frontier market in the region. With easy visa policies — including business visas that can be extended indefinitely — Cambodia is ideal for anyone who hates red tape. You can stay long-term with minimal paperwork.



Second, the tax system is favorable for foreigners. Cambodia doesn’t tax foreign-sourced income, so digital nomads and remote workers can often legally pay zero income tax. That’s a rare advantage in a world increasingly cracking down on tax havens.



Third, USD is widely used. The economy operates on the US dollar, meaning no forex risks or conversions for most transactions. This financial simplicity is great for entrepreneurs and expats who get paid in dollars.



For a wild west, low-regulation environment with business opportunities in real estate, hospitality, or startups — Cambodia is unmatched.



3. Vietnam: The Rising Economic Star with Investment Upside

Vietnam is often touted as the next economic powerhouse of Asia. With consistent 7%+ annual growth, it’s becoming a manufacturing and tech hub that rivals China.



First, cost of living is incredibly affordable. Cities like Ho Chi Minh and Da Nang offer great apartments, coworking spaces, and street food for a fraction of Western prices — without compromising urban energy.



Second, Vietnam is rich in culture and lifestyle. Whether it’s the beach towns, motorbike adventures, or coffee shop culture, Vietnam offers a unique daily experience that blends old-world charm with modern energy.



Third, investment potential. From real estate to startups, Vietnam is open for those looking for growth. Foreign investment is increasingly welcomed, especially in sectors like tech, exports, and tourism.



The Bottom Line:

If you want English convenience and social life, pick the Philippines. For tax optimization and easy visas, Cambodia is your choice. If growth, culture, and investing excites you, Vietnam wins.



Forget the rest — these are the only 3 places you should seriously consider in Southeast Asia right now.

I don't mind you messing up, but please don't do it on purpose, and don't spend too much time between stages, put the things you get in your stash and decide what you want to scrap when we are back outside. I'll be using a magazine buff. That's on a timer and they're hard to farm for so I'd hate to see it go to waste: alternatively you may offer me a Tesla Science 7s or Guns and Bullets 9 and you can take all the time in the world. 

If you have no idea what to do at all- no problem! Just let me know and I'll give you a small instruction before every stage.

If you are worried about carry weight. There's an unlocked mirelurk boiler at my camp- help yourself to some fillets. 

Also my Internet isn't the best. If I crash do NOT leave the raid. I can come back in, when I am back in and give you a thumbs up just start the stage I will be teleported to you.

If I do die- feel free to try the stage for yourself, I'll be watching you in amusement while sipping coffee! :) 

For stage 1:
I am not a meta build and I only kill the bot in the second phase. I would prefer players stand behind me or as close as possible since I take down the shields with my reflective armor pieces and want it to focus on me. 
Ping me the open bunker if you spot it fast!

For stage 2:
I love running but if no one else is capable of protecting the drill I will do it. I would propose someone start with the protection and when the miners get too strong, give me a flailing arms emote and I will tag you out. Please keep the 3 canisters who are right outside the drill room for last in case some of us get killed, then the protector can grab them easily :) 
If you die- please watch the screen of someone running canisters so you get a better understanding of where and how to grab them! We might need a couple tries to finish this, since it's the only stage that cannot be solod. Don't beat yourself up and do your best! 

For stage 3: 
You are worth more to me alive and keeping the generators broken than dead, if I'm the last one standing it will take a lot longer so please try to avoid the Bloodhound.
But if you keep Lynx off my back i will cherish it greatly. ( This one is a bigger threat to your AP than your health) 

For stage 4:  
Please let me destroy the 3 big crystals! I'd also prefer we only crush small crystals when the stalker is near them, but I don't mind if you take out a crystal here and there to speed things up. You will be getting an angry super mutant emote if I notice an entire floor of crystals missing though. 

For stage 5:
Don't really need help here but the faster the tail goes down the faster I can go back to damage the snek so maybe focus on that! :) 


If interested, post a comment, send me a dm, blow some smoke signals- whatever you're comfy with. :) 
I'll be online for a couple hours but I'm down to raid another time too. 
(Also I will gloss over your reddit profile, if you're active in hate subreddits just save me the time and don't interact. Life is too short to be miserable) 
If you have any questions regarding the raids please ask Id love to help.

It's not just about picking any table - it needs to balance functionality with clean aesthetics.

I spent weeks researching and testing different coffee tables, and I want to share what I discovered. The key is finding something that serves your needs without cluttering the space.

First, measure your space carefully. In minimalist design, the coffee table should take up about two-thirds of your sofa's length. This proportion keeps things balanced without overwhelming the room. Leave about 18 inches between the table and seating for comfortable movement.

Material choice matters a lot. I found that glass tables create an airy feel and make small spaces look bigger. Wood tables in natural finishes add warmth while maintaining simplicity. Metal tables with clean lines work great too. You can check out some excellent options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Storage is another factor to consider. Hidden compartments help maintain that clutter-free look while keeping essentials within reach. Some tables come with sleek drawers or lift-top designs that don't compromise the minimal aesthetic.

Shape is crucial too. Round tables soften the look of angular furniture and work well in smaller spaces. Rectangular tables are classic and practical, especially if you have a larger seating area. Just avoid ornate details or busy patterns.

Consider these features when choosing:
- Clean lines
- Simple geometry
- Limited ornamentation
- Functional design
- Quality materials
- Proper scale

I've found some great minimalist coffee tables that tick all these boxes. If you're interested in exploring options, check out this curated selection: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Remember that in minimalist design, every piece should serve a purpose. Your coffee table should be both functional and visually pleasing without drawing too much attention.

Color is another important aspect. Stick to neutral tones or match your existing color scheme. White, black, natural wood, or metal finishes work best in minimalist spaces.

The height of your coffee table matters too. It should be slightly lower than your sofa seat height - usually between 16-18 inches. This makes it comfortable to use while maintaining visual harmony.

Lastly, don't forget about maintenance. Choose materials that are easy to clean and maintain. This keeps with the minimalist principle of simplicity in all aspects, including care and upkeep.

I've applied these principles in my own home, and the difference is noticeable. The right coffee table can truly anchor your living space while maintaining that clean, uncluttered look that minimalism is all about.",1,1753058374.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

My name is Michael, and recently I started a job as a security footage reviewer for a tech company called Endotech, which is well-regarded for its treatment of its employees. It’s not a massive conglomerate, but it’s pretty well-known in the area for being a pleasant company to work for. Besides the pay being above average compared to most other companies, there wasn’t much to go on in the job description. I wasn’t that knowledgeable about what I was going to be doing; all I knew was I would be looking at security footage, and with the pay it offered, it was a good opportunity for me, especially since I just moved to the area and was in desperate need of a job.
After getting back an email from Mr. Hostel, the boss, we scheduled an interview. Though I was anxious, the day came closer and closer until it was time to go, so I put on my most professional attire and drove off to the 5-floored building brandishing the words Endotech in a soft blue LED that looked like it could come straight from a sci-fi movie, its light bleeding onto the building like it could swallow it whole in a matter of days.
As I walked through the interior doors, the dirty-blonde receptionist with soft blue eyes sitting at the sleek wooden desk noticed my presence and—before she could ask why I was there—Mr. Hostel walked in behind me, exclaiming, “Michael, right on time, just like I thought you’d be. Follow me up to my office; we can discuss the details of your possible employment here,” he said with a sense of pride.
“Of course, sir.” I followed in suit behind him, walking past the receptionist; as I did, she gave me a smile and a nod of encouragement, and as we walked the halls, I felt like there were too many doors and hallways; they seemed to split off in every direction like a maze that once lost in, you’d never be able to find your way out of.
The innards of the building almost resembled an old hospital building as we walked the cold, white halls with the long echoes of silence and footsteps trailing behind us like an unknown entity crawling behind you, desperate to grab you at first chance, only to slowly fall behind further and further, never to be heard from again.
As we arrived at the elevator, the path seemed long and felt narrow, closing in on us more and more as we got closer to the elevator doors. Once we got there, we took the elevator up to the 4th floor and continued on our venture, passing more doors, some open and some closed, the open ones showing an office-like interior with large windows panning the walls, the inside stuffed with frozen grey cubicles filling the floor space.
In the corner of one of the rooms, a younger gentleman sat, maybe finishing work or maybe packing up; I couldn’t tell in the 3 seconds it took for us to walk past the door as we ended our journey at Mr. Hostel’s golden nameplate, dark brown wooden door. We entered his office; it was reasonably large for the area the building was in. He sat down while I got comfortable in the chair in front of his desk.
He moved some papers around, and while doing so, asked me if I was ready to start the interview, to which my response elicited his explanation of information containing history about the company, its founder, what we did, and what I was going to be doing in the position I applied for. I was immediately put at ease. Mr. Hostel was a very charming and friendly; he was about 5’6’ with a balding head and pearly white teeth that could be fake.
He said, “Don’t worry too much about the small stuff; your job won’t be too hard since the AI gives you the scraps. Just watch a couple of videos every day and make sure to keep up on your logs. He told me they have a program that separates the footage and that I would be combing through the miscellaneous footage for anything out of the ordinary, just as an insurance measure, since nothing works a hundred percent of the time.”
I was relieved to hear that I wouldn’t have to watch hundreds of hours of workers typing on computers and printing out paper. Not that it matters, as I would get paid either way, but the thought of watching someone else work felt extremely boring.
After explaining everything, he got up, shook my hand, and said, “I look forward to working with you. Your references and resume give us confidence in choosing you for the position. Congratulations and welcome to our company.” He shook my hand as he gave me the job. I was so excited I must’ve looked like a kid on Christmas, beaming ear to ear, but knowing I wouldn’t be out on my month’s rent was something I couldn’t not be excited about.
I shook his hand, thanking him for his time and the opportunity. I walked back to the elevator, took it to the first floor, walked down the cold, dead halls, the echoes of my feet reverberating in the silence behind me, and as I walked past the receptionist, I smiled and nodded before walking out and driving home.
Walking into my 3-bed, 2-bath apartment, I breathed a sigh of relief knowing my money problems would soon be over. I slumped onto my bed, undid the tie on my dark grey suit with matching pants, and the sweat stains lining the white undershirt I had been wearing soaked like a waterfall sprouted under my arms from how anxious I had felt waiting for the interview.
Kicking off the stuffy shoes, I finally felt like I could relax. My prayers were answered, and I finally got a job.
My first day came up fast. I arrived 10 minutes early, walking into the office to see the hustle and bustle of office workers clocking in, getting coffee, and heading to their rooms to start the day. The day before, Mr. Hostel emailed me the information I would need for my first day. He told me I was to go to the receptionist and ask her to call Eddie and inform him that the new footage guy was in and needed to be shown the ropes.
I went in and introduced myself to the receptionist, learning her name was Leslie. Leslie called Eddie, his charisma leaking through the phone in the short 2-minute conversation she had with him. I could hear his voice from down that hall as he hung up, and he was saying good morning and hello to the workers coming in for their shift as he walked to the waiting area.
My first impression upon seeing Eddie was that he was a tall, brown-haired guy with prominent dimples on his cheeks. He had a nice smile and intense, dark green eyes. He was charismatic and kind.
As he reached out to shake my hand, he introduced himself. “Hey, Michael. Good to meet you. My name’s Eddie. I’m unsure if Mr. Hostel already told you my name; either way, I’m the tech head, and Mr. Hostel asked me to guide you to your area and show you what you will be doing. If you want to follow me, I’ll show you how to clock in and where to go.”
I followed him to the clock-in area; he gave me my tag, swiped it into the small box, clocked in, and guided me to my location. It was a small room on the first floor at the end of the hall, stacked with monitors, a small cabinet, and a single chair.
“It’s not the greatest thing in the world, but it’s not the worst. I’ve seen worse; trust me, there was one room we used to have that had servers lined the walls, and in the back was where you would work. The place was like a sauna, and there was a cute old box TV with a VCR on top of it. A couple of the other tech guys and I would bring in old tapes and play them until one of my old sitcoms got caught and we couldn’t use it anymore. Sad times,” he said with a chuckle before logging me into my computer and showing me where the footage would be and what I was looking for.
It was pretty simple instructions. I would log in, open the folders, and watch the footage. That was about it; I was to ensure everything was up to par and nothing was out of the ordinary. I would then write the name of the footage, the date I reviewed it, and my signature for some authenticity.
After he showed me what to do, he told me to hop to it and try not to get too bored. He told me where the bathroom and break room were and said I could walk around, but before he left, he said, “Glad to be working with you, Michael. Just one word of advice before you start working here: don’t go to the fifth floor. Only the bosses are allowed up there, and no one else is allowed, so if you see anyone, let Mr. Hostel or me know about it. If you’re caught up there without the right clearance, you’ll lose your job immediately and be escorted off the premises, but with that, I’ll leave it to you, and I’ll see you around. He patted my back, said, “Don’t be a stranger,” and walked away.
Following Eddie’s instructions, the first month passed. I did my job, watched the footage, logged it, got paid, paid my rent with a sigh of relief, and made sure to stay clear of the fifth floor, which wasn’t all that hard. I talked to Eddie and Leslie and got to know them better. Leslie was a cute, dirty blonde with blue eyes. She had a good sense of humor and was flirtatious; she liked to joke around with everyone like Eddie, but she would find herself touching your arm or laughing while touching your shoulder. Nothing anyone didn’t like. They introduced me to some of our coworkers and showed me around the building. All in all, I was starting to enjoy my new place of work; everything was pretty great up until around the three-month mark, when things started to get a little odd, to say the least.
Most of the footage I was allocated to review was of the front room guards and the night security, along with some empty halls and busy workers. Still, oddly enough, the majority of the footage was of the fifth floor, and there was always one security guard on the cameras. I believe his name was Terrence; he was an older Asian gentleman with greying hair that only covered the sides of his head—the top was bald. He was a shorter man with a slight bend in his posture. I didn’t think much of it, but I noticed he would go up to the fifth floor around the same time every night. It wasn’t all that out of the ordinary, considering his job.
I was curious about how he was allowed up there, so I thought I’d ask about him. However, I couldn’t find him, so I decided to ask Leslie about old man Terrence, and she told me he had been there even before her and that he’s been the overnight security guard since the company was started. I asked her if she knew him personally, and she told me no. So I asked her why he was allowed on the fifth floor, and her response startled me. Her face tightened, looking full of malice, her eyes squinting tightly like she needed glasses. The whites of her eyes took on a yellow hue, and her pupils were wide, as if she were staring into a bright light. Her tone also changed; she wasn’t cheery and flirtatious but cold and serious. She spoke to me as though I had offended her beyond belief.
“You shouldn’t ask about old man Terrence that much; if you do, you’ll start to upset many people. Everybody in the building likes him, and he’s nice. If you’re curious, I’d ask him yourself, because none of us will tell you anything more than I already have.”
After that, her face relaxed, her eyes returned to normal, and the color bled back into her skin. Strangely enough, she acted as though we hadn’t just had that conversation, asking me how my day was and what I was up to. The entire interaction threw me for a loop. I wasn’t sure what to do after that. Unsure of how to respond, I told her I was heading to the bathroom and said I’d see her later. I left, doing my best not to react or act out of character.
I wasn’t sure what to make of my interaction with Leslie. She felt inhuman in that moment, as though if I had turned my back on her, she could’ve eaten me whole and not a soul in the world would’ve been any the wiser. I decided to stop asking questions about the old man, fearing that Leslie’s warning might be my final one. Once that decision was made, I steered clear of ever seeing or mentioning old man Terrence to another person in the building. I wasn’t even sure if I could ask Mr. Hostel about him, either out of fear or terror that maybe his reaction would be even more extreme.
The thought of losing my job over asking a question put a fear in my heart that a shower and a warm dinner couldn’t shake. I went to bed that night thinking that maybe my job wasn’t as simple as I thought it would be. I spent the next couple of days in a paranoid fear that someone might be watching me. Leslie’s warning included “none of us,” which meant there were more people I had to be careful around. Unsure and scared, I decided to mind my own business, opting to clock in, work my shift, clock out, and go home.
As I watched more and more footage, old man Terrence appeared more frequently—as if he were in every clip. I believe the AI program designated him as miscellaneous since he mostly stands around doors watching the entrances or walking down the halls, seemingly doing nothing for hours. Until 2 a.m. came, and he would walk to the fifth floor, disappear behind a door, and not be seen again for the rest of the night.
I tried my best to ignore him, choosing to watch the footage and log it as though it was normal. But I started to notice that things seemed off with Terrence. It wasn’t anything obvious—it was more like a feeling. An odd sense that something was wrong with him. And it made me want to pay more attention and watch his actions closely.
Sometimes, I would notice his skin looked darker and had a rougher texture. His veins looked solid, almost like they were fighting against his flesh, trying to escape the confines of his wrinkled skin. His walk was strange—like if an infant were born an adult. His knees wouldn’t bend correctly, and his center of gravity seemed off. Sometimes his knees bent slightly backward, like a flamingo’s, or curved outward toward his sides just enough to look unnatural. It wasn’t every time, but enough to throw me off and creep me out.
I remember one night he stood in the dark at the end of a hallway, just staring. There were no sounds or motion in the hallway. But the microphones picked up his voice—he was mumbling in a way that didn’t make sense. He said words, but they had no meaning—like a jumbled language made audible. It sounded like vibration was his first language. Every time I tried to rewatch the footage, I’d get a splitting migraine and have to stop.
Around a week after another incident—where I saw his arms stretch longer than what should be humanly possible—I decided I needed a second opinion. Maybe it was just camera glitches. Or maybe something else. Either way, I needed someone to confirm that I wasn’t going crazy. So I asked Eddie to take a look at the footage with me. I needed the support. Even if nothing seemed obvious, it was gnawing at the back of my mind, and I couldn’t shake it. Since Eddie was our main tech lead—and my closest friend at the office—I figured he was the best person to ask.
Eddie entered my little camera viewing room, his relaxed demeanor calming me slightly as he walked up to my corner full of monitors.
“Hey Eddie, thanks for coming. I know I emailed you immediately—sorry about that.” I felt a little bad calling him in during his lunch break, but I wasn’t sure when else he could’ve helped.
“No worries, Mikey. I can eat whenever I want. I usually just take my lunch to smoke anyway, so no harm, no foul. But what’s this about some footage you wanted me to take a look at?”
“Yeah, I’ve got some footage set aside that’s been bugging me, and I wanted your input. It’s of the night security guard, old man Terrence—it just seems odd.”
“Oh, old man Terrence,” Eddie replied. “I haven’t seen him in a while since they moved him to night duty. He used to be a front office guard, but I guess he got too old and switched shifts.”
As he watched the footage, his demeanor shifted slightly, though I couldn’t tell exactly how. Then he said, “Doesn’t seem like anything out of the ordinary, Mikey. Maybe all these blue lights are starting to burn the visuals into your brain,” he joked, his eyes never leaving the screen—staring with laser focus, like a hunter locked onto prey.
I chuckled. “Yeah, you’re right. Maybe I need to start wearing blue light glasses before my brain fries.”
Even though Eddie said nothing was wrong, it didn’t satisfy the itch I had hoped it would. Something still felt wrong, but I couldn’t put my finger on what. As Eddie left the room, he said, “Don’t worry too much about old man Terrence. He’s been around since the company came to town, and I can guarantee there’s nothing wrong with him—and nothing wrong with the footage. I put those cameras up myself and do weekly maintenance.”
As Eddie walked away, I muttered that maybe he was doing more damage than maintenance. From the distant, echoed halls, I heard his faint laughter trailing behind him.

CHAPTER ONE

Nia – Friday Night, Late October

The new neighbors arrived in the middle of the night.

Not the poetic kind of arrival—no soft headlights or murmured apologies. This was bright floodlights, slamming van doors, and two men arguing in what sounded like surround sound. She sat up in bed before she was fully awake, blinking toward the window as Zoey gave a low, annoyed bark from the foot of the bed.

“What the hell…” she mumbled, already swinging her legs over the side.

Her boyfriend, half-asleep, muttered something unintelligible into his pillow.

Out the bedroom window, the glow of the U-Haul lit up their shared driveway like a stage. Four people were unloading furniture with the kind of intensity reserved for last-minute movers or people who didn’t care how much noise they made. The low scrape of something heavy across pavement hit her chest like a car alarm.

“Seriously?” she hissed.

She padded barefoot to the living room and flicked on the porch light, just in case the cue was missed.

It wasn’t.

A tall man in a navy hoodie glanced up, pausing mid-step with what looked like a dining chair held over one shoulder. Their eyes met—just for a second—and Nia did what she always did when caught watching something she wasn’t supposed to: she raised her eyebrows like she was surprised he was there.

Her boyfriend came down the hall then, tugging on a hoodie. “Want me to say something?”

“Let’s both go,” she said, wrapping her cardigan tight and slipping on the clogs by the door.

They stepped outside into the cold, where the night smelled like damp concrete and stress.

“Hey,” Nia called, loud enough to be heard but not aggressive. “It’s almost one a.m.… Is this really happening now?”

One of the men—maybe the brother—stopped moving a rolled carpet and looked at her sheepishly. The tall one—hoodie, chair guy—set the chair down and walked over.

“Sorry,” he said, his accent light but noticeable. “The truck rental was delayed, and we couldn’t wait.”

“Couldn’t you at least keep it down?” her boyfriend added. “Some of us work in the morning.”

“Yeah, of course,” the man said, already nodding. “We’ll try to finish fast.”

He sounded sincere. Not irritated. Just tired.

Nia held his gaze for a second longer than she needed to. He had kind eyes, she noticed—annoyingly kind for someone who had woken her up with an armoire.

“Thanks,” she said, softer this time. “We’ve just had… a few chaotic neighbors.”

He nodded again, then turned and relayed something in another language—Gujarati, maybe—to the rest of the group. Their pace slowed.

She and her boyfriend went back inside. Zoey had already curled back up on the bed like nothing had happened. Typical.

As she settled under the covers again, Nia stared at the ceiling.

There was something about them. She wasn’t sure what yet—but something told her this move-in would matter in ways she couldn’t name.

By Saturday night, she was convinced they had moved in and vanished.

No footsteps. No furniture assembly. No kitchen clatter through the wall. Not even the thump of someone running up the stairs too fast.

Just silence.

It made her suspicious.

She didn’t like surprises when it came to neighbors. Last time, the surprise had been a drum kit and a poorly trained German Shepherd. Before that, someone who hotboxed the shed with the same playlist on loop every Friday.

She went about her day, half-expecting to hear something—an argument, a vacuum, a blender, anything. Instead, it was just Zoey’s paws clicking on the floor and the occasional gust of wind rattling the partition fence she had paid for herself. She made dinner, read a chapter of something she’d started three times already, and lit a candle with a scent called evening fig. By 9 p.m., the house felt too still.

She even stood in the hallway at one point, just listening.

Nothing.

“Maybe they’re ghosts,” she muttered.

Zoey didn’t even lift her head.

⸻

On Sunday afternoon, she gave in.

She wasn’t going to let a single bad start set the tone. It wasn’t her style. Plus, curiosity had been eating at her all weekend.

She made a coffee, took it to go in a travel mug, and walked the long way around the front, pausing for a second on the lawn as if that would make it less awkward.

The front door was open, screen shut. She knocked once—just enough to be heard. She could see someone’s shadow move inside before the door opened.

It was him—the tall one from the night before. Hoodie replaced by a plain dark tee. There was a slight smell of masala or cumin behind him, something warm and bright.

“Hi,” she said, shifting her weight. “I just—wanted to say sorry for the other night. We were kind of abrupt. It was late, and I guess we were cranky.”

He blinked, then smiled slightly. “No problem. We were loud.”

“You were moving. It happens,” she said. “I just wanted to say welcome, properly.”

“Thanks.” He opened the door a bit wider but didn’t step out.

“I’m Nia, by the way. We live on the other side. With the very barky dog.”

His smile warmed. “Scotch barked back this morning. So, fair.”

“Scotch?” she asked.

“Our dog. Husky mix. White and brown. Just turned four.”

“Same age as Zoey. They should meet sometime.”

“Sure,” he said. “Once we’re settled.”

There was a pause. The kind that’s hard to end without a script.

“Anyway,” she said, stepping back, “just wanted to say hi.”

He nodded. “Raj.”

She smiled. “Nice to meet you, Raj.”

She turned, half-expecting Zoey to be watching from the window like a jealous sibling.



CHAPTER TWO

Shared POV – Thursday, October 31st – Diwali & Halloween

The neighborhood smelled like burnt sugar and wet leaves.

It was the kind of fall evening that settled fast—sky smudged grey, air thin and cold, every porch lit up with paper skeletons or dollar-store cobwebs. On Nia’s side of the duplex, the jack-o’-lantern flickered gently, half-smiling into the dark. The bowl of candy was already half empty by six-thirty, and she wasn’t sure if that meant they were doing well or if kids were just greedy this year.

Her boyfriend was on the steps, hoodie up, handing out bars with the enthusiasm of someone pretending to like children. Nia watched from the door, sipping wine and laughing every time he guessed a costume wrong.

Across the lawn, the other side of the duplex glowed gold.

No Halloween decorations. No porch lights.

Instead, there were candles—small, flickering diyas—lined up neatly along the walkway. Orange marigolds in metal bowls. The smell of ghee, cardamom, something fried and fragrant that drifted over with the breeze.

It was the kind of warmth that didn’t ask to be noticed, but couldn’t be ignored.

Through the fence slats, Nia caught flashes of movement: people gathered in the backyard, maybe a dozen or more. Voices rising, laughing, then fading again. Not wild—just full.

There was music, too. Not loud. Just enough to reach her through the walls—a rhythmic beat, something bright and pulsing, threaded with voices she couldn’t understand but felt anyway.

She closed her eyes for a moment and let it wash over her.

⸻

Raj stood near the fire pit, hands in his pockets, watching his cousin attempt to light another diya without burning off his eyebrows. The backyard was crowded—extended family from Bedford and Dartmouth had come, bringing food and noise and stories. His sister had cooked for two days straight. His brother had hung string lights at 2 a.m. because “Diwali is still Diwali, even if the neighbors sleep at nine.”

No one seemed to mind the space. No one complained.

For a moment, Raj forgot where he was.

Then he looked toward the other side of the fence.

Their half of the yard was dark. Porch light on, jack-o’-lantern grinning, soft porch voices. He saw her silhouette—Nia—on the doorstep, glass in hand. Laughing at something her partner said. At peace.

He wondered if she could hear the music. If she recognized the beat. If she resented the sound or secretly leaned into it.

There was no way to know.

But when their eyes met—across flame and fence, porch and shadow—it lasted just long enough to register.

Not a greeting.

Not a moment.

Just… recognition.

⸻

Later, long after the candy had run out and the fire had burned low, Nia lay in bed and smelled spices in the air vents. She thought of the warmth on the other side of the wall. The laughter. The music.

It wasn’t envy exactly. More like… a memory.

She drifted off thinking of a courtyard in Ahmedabad, long ago. Gold light. Cracked tiles. Bells in the distance.

The front step had grown cold beneath Nia’s legs, but she stayed until the last round of trick-or-treaters passed.

“Pretty sure that was the same kid twice,” her boyfriend said, chewing on a mini Snickers.

Nia smirked. “Bold of you to assume I care.”

They shut the porch light off around eight and went inside, candy bowl now mostly wrappers. Zoey was at a kennel overnight—the first time in months. Nia hated the silence it left behind, the way it made the house echo. So, they drowned it out.

A Treehouse of Horror marathon was already queued up, and Nia curled into the couch with a throw blanket and a glass of cheap red. They knew every line—Homer in space, Bart’s evil twin—but it didn’t matter. It was tradition. Silly, predictable, steady.

Around them, the house throbbed faintly with distant sound. A bass beat through the floor. Voices rising from the other side of the wall. Not intrusive—just… present.

She muted the TV during commercials and listened.

⸻

On the other side of the wall, Raj led his uncle through the kitchen, Scotch trailing behind them, tail wagging like he’d been raised in this house all along.

“Basement?” his uncle asked.

Raj nodded. “Yeah, come see.”

He opened the door, flicked on the light, and winced slightly. The basement was half-finished—low ceilings, cool concrete, a soft echo that bounced off every step. The stairs creaked, and he made a mental note to oil them. Again.

“Not soundproof,” he admitted.

“Good for storage though,” his uncle said, poking the water heater approvingly.

Upstairs, his sister gave her cousin a tour of the bedrooms. The smallest had already become the prayer room, with marigold-colored cloth pinned above a shelf of framed gods. His cousin laughed at the house’s narrow hallway. “Classic Nova Scotia,” she said. “Everything’s just a bit too close.”

Raj liked it.

The upstairs windows looked out over the backyard—bigger than they’d expected, wide enough for Scotch to stretch his legs and for spring gardens to take shape. He imagined a lawn chair out there. A grill. Morning tea with sunlight cutting through the fence slats.

He heard someone laugh on the other side. A woman’s voice—brief, then muffled.

He wondered if she thought the same thing about the backyard. If she’d ever admit it.

⸻

By the time midnight crept in, both houses had settled.

Nia had dozed off for the end of Season 12. Her boyfriend was snoring lightly, TV still glowing. The wine glass on the coffee table was half full, the flame of her lavender candle just a stub.

Raj stood at the back door, watching the last of the diyas flicker out.

Scotch pressed his head against Raj’s leg, sleepy and full. Someone had given him too much paneer.

The house was warm now. Lived-in. Real.

And though Raj didn’t know it, on the other side of the wall, Nia was dreaming of yellow light and a fire she couldn’t see.

CHAPTER THREE

Raj – Early November

The house felt different now that everyone was gone.

The weekend had been loud—clinking metal bowls, tangled shoes at the door, cousins yelling across staircases, the sharp burn of clove oil in the air. Even Scotch had been overstimulated, spinning in circles through legs and open doors.

But now, on Monday evening, it was quiet. Raj stood in the kitchen, waiting for the rice cooker to click. His sister was upstairs on a call. His cousin had gone to the gym. His brother was already in bed with a podcast playing low.

The house held its breath.

Raj opened the back door to let the air out. Halifax smelled different after dark. Damp leaves, maybe. A hint of salt from the harbor, even this far up. He stepped outside barefoot, Scotch trotting out beside him.

The backyard felt huge in the dark.

Bigger than it had during the family tour. The string lights still hung across the fence from Diwali. A few had already gone out. He made a note to take them down. Maybe on the weekend.

Next door, her porch light was still on.

He could see her shape through the window—just a flicker. She moved like someone who wasn’t trying to be noticed but also wasn’t hiding. He didn’t know her name yet, but she was the one who’d come to the door on Sunday.

Nia. That was it. She’d introduced herself. Offered to let the dogs meet.

Once we’re settled, he had said.

He didn’t mean to lie. He just wasn’t ready.

⸻

On Tuesday morning, he heard music through the wall for the first time.

Not loud. Just a thrum of bass and something vaguely electronic—tempo too upbeat for how cold the air felt. He stood in the hallway and listened without realizing it, one sock half-pulled on.

Then the song changed. A softer melody, almost Greek in structure—he couldn’t name it, but it reminded him of his father’s old CDs, the ones they used to listen to in the shop during monsoon season.

He found himself wondering: Did she know what it meant to be far from home?

Then Scotch barked at nothing, and the moment passed.


CHAPTER THREE (continued)

Raj – Early November, Tuesday Morning

The work car wasn’t anything special—just a silver sedan with the city logo on the side and a clipboard wedged forever in the backseat. But it gave him a strange sense of pride, parking it in front of the house.

He parked it neatly that morning, lining it up between the faded curb lines the way his manager had once demonstrated like it was a sacred ritual. One tire too close to the driveway, though—just a little.

Scotch barked once through the front window, then immediately lost interest.

Raj had just locked the door when he heard her.

“Hi—excuse me?”

He turned.

She was standing on her side of the front walk, wearing boots, leggings, a long coat, and a high ponytail that made her look taller than she probably was. Mug in hand, dog-less this time.

“Sorry—just wanted to ask,” she said, pointing toward the work car. “If you could leave a bit more space near the curb when you park, that would be amazing. It’s kind of tight for two vehicles.”

Raj blinked. “Oh. Yeah, of course. Sorry.”

Her smile was polite. Noncommittal. Not unkind. “Thanks. It’s just a weird little corner.”

“No problem,” he said.

She nodded once and turned, already heading up the steps. As she reached the top, she added over her shoulder, “Have a good day.”

“You too,” he said, too quietly for her to hear.

He stood there for another moment, keys in hand.

It wasn’t the comment—it was fine. Reasonable. Normal.

It was the way she’d said it: all soft authority and clipped efficiency, like someone used to saying things exactly once and having them land.

It reminded him of his supervisor.

Or his older sister.

Or the woman at the Service Canada counter who didn’t look up when he’d passed his citizenship interview.

He walked to the car and adjusted it anyway.

Just an extra six inches.

But something about it stayed with him all day.


CHAPTER THREE (continued)

Raj – Tuesday Afternoon & Evening

Work that day was mostly follow-ups.

Overgrown hedges. A resident claiming their neighbor had built a deck too close to the lot line. Someone demanding to know why a shed had to be moved two feet to the left. Raj typed in notes, double-checked file numbers, flagged a complaint for a re-inspection.

He liked the rules. There was clarity in them. Permits either existed or they didn’t. Fences were either regulation height or not. It wasn’t personal.

He printed a compliance notice for a case he’d been following since July—fencing installed without a permit, six inches too high. Just like his supervisor said: “Half a foot can cause a lot of noise.”

He smirked at that.

Still, something about the morning’s exchange stuck in his ribs. Nia’s voice. The way she said “that would be amazing” like it was just short of “please don’t make me say this again.”

⸻

That evening, the house was calm again. His sister cooked while humming something in Gujarati. The pressure cooker hissed in the kitchen. His cousin was watching a game in the living room.

Raj stood near the front window, adjusting the curtain just enough to look out.

Her car was back. The same compact grey one with the reusable grocery bags still visible in the back seat. The porch light was off, but a warm yellow glowed in the front window.

Then came the bark.

Short. Sharp. Then two more in quick succession.

Zoey.

He didn’t know the dog well yet, but he could tell—it barked at everything. Leaves. Squirrels. Passing ghosts. Scotch barked back sometimes, more out of obligation than enthusiasm.

Still, the sound surprised him.

Not because it was loud. But because he liked knowing she was home.

He turned away from the window, annoyed at himself for even thinking that.

He wasn’t here to pay attention to his neighbor.

He was here to build a life.",1,1753058152.0,writers,2,0.67,False

## Key Features Analysis

The lucite cocktail tables available in 2025 showcase several advanced features that enhance their functionality and aesthetic appeal.

**Material Quality and Durability:** The quality of the lucite used is paramount. High-end tables utilize thick, high-grade acrylic that is resistant to scratches, impacts, and yellowing. This ensures the table maintains its clarity and structural integrity over time, even with regular use. Lower-quality tables may use thinner acrylic that is more prone to damage and discoloration.

**Design and Style Options:** Lucite cocktail tables come in a variety of shapes and styles, from simple rectangular designs to more elaborate geometric forms. Some tables feature integrated storage, such as shelves or drawers, while others incorporate metallic accents or colored lucite for added visual interest. The design options cater to different aesthetic preferences, allowing homeowners to find a table that complements their existing decor.

**Size and Dimensions:** The dimensions of a lucite cocktail table are crucial for ensuring it fits appropriately within a living space. Tables range from small, compact designs suitable for apartments to larger, more substantial pieces ideal for spacious living rooms. Height is also an important consideration, as the table should be at a comfortable height for reaching drinks and snacks while seated.

**Weight Capacity:** A sturdy lucite cocktail table should be able to support a reasonable amount of weight without buckling or cracking. High-quality tables are designed to withstand the weight of multiple drinks, books, and decorative items. The weight capacity is often determined by the thickness of the lucite and the design of the table's base.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance:** Lucite is a relatively easy material to clean and maintain. A soft cloth and mild detergent are typically sufficient for removing dirt and smudges. However, it's important to avoid using abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals, as these can scratch or damage the lucite surface. Regular cleaning will help keep the table looking its best.

**Stability and Balance:** A well-designed lucite cocktail table should be stable and balanced, even on uneven surfaces. Some tables feature adjustable feet or non-slip pads to prevent them from wobbling or sliding. The weight distribution of the table is also important for ensuring it remains upright and secure.

Key features of the best lucite cocktail tables include:

*   High-quality, scratch-resistant acrylic
*   Diverse design and style options
*   Appropriate size and dimensions for various spaces
*   Sufficient weight capacity for everyday use
*   Easy cleaning and maintenance

## Core Benefits

Lucite cocktail tables offer several practical benefits that make them a popular choice for homeowners and interior designers alike.

**Enhanced Aesthetics:** The transparent nature of lucite allows these tables to blend seamlessly into any decor, adding a touch of modern elegance without overpowering the space. Unlike traditional wooden or metal tables, lucite tables don't visually clutter a room, making them ideal for smaller spaces or minimalist designs. The clean lines and sleek surfaces of lucite contribute to a sophisticated and contemporary look.

**Versatile Functionality:** Lucite cocktail tables provide a versatile surface for serving drinks, displaying decor, or simply resting your feet. Their sturdy construction and ample surface area make them suitable for a variety of uses, from hosting cocktail parties to providing a convenient spot for books and magazines. Some tables also feature integrated storage, adding even more functionality to the design.

**Durability and Longevity:** High-quality lucite is a durable material that can withstand the rigors of daily use. Scratch-resistant and impact-resistant, these tables are designed to last for many years with proper care. Unlike wooden tables, lucite is not susceptible to water damage or warping, making it a practical choice for humid environments.

**Easy Maintenance:** Lucite is a low-maintenance material that is easy to clean and keep looking its best. A simple wipe-down with a soft cloth and mild detergent is usually all that's needed to remove dirt and smudges. This makes lucite cocktail tables a convenient choice for busy homeowners who don't want to spend a lot of time on upkeep.

**Space-Saving Design:** Because lucite is transparent, these tables create the illusion of more space in a room. They don't block light or visually obstruct the view, making them ideal for smaller apartments or crowded living rooms. Their minimalist design also helps to keep the space feeling open and airy.

## FAQs Section

**Are lucite cocktail tables prone to scratching?**
    High-quality lucite is relatively scratch-resistant, but it's not completely impervious to damage. It's important to avoid using abrasive cleaners or rough cloths, as these can scratch the surface. Using a soft cloth and mild detergent is the best way to clean lucite without causing damage.

**How much weight can a lucite cocktail table typically hold?**
    The weight capacity of a lucite cocktail table varies depending on the thickness of the lucite and the design of the table. However, most high-quality tables can easily support the weight of multiple drinks, books, and decorative items. Check the manufacturer's specifications for the exact weight capacity of a particular table.

**Can lucite cocktail tables be used outdoors?**
    While lucite is a durable material, it's not typically recommended for outdoor use. Prolonged exposure to sunlight can cause the lucite to yellow or become brittle over time. If you plan to use a lucite cocktail table outdoors, be sure to keep it in a shaded area and protect it from the elements.

**How do I prevent my lucite cocktail table from wobbling?**
    Some lucite cocktail tables feature adjustable feet or non-slip pads to prevent them from wobbling on uneven surfaces. If your table doesn't have these features, you can purchase aftermarket levelers or pads to add stability. Make sure the table is placed on a level surface to minimize the risk of wobbling.

Then when things started to get better i fell and i hurt my ankle very badly. Doctors couldnt figure out why i had very swollen very painfull ankles as they said bones didnt broke and i couldnt walk for 8 months without pain (which went away on it is own) and i am still terrified for walking too long.

I gained 30 kgs in 5 years and got insulin resistance.

So i’ve started to cut all sugar (except vegetables which has sugar in them) and in a very strict calorie deficit (like daily intake 800 according to chatgpt)

I am losing weight ( lost 5 kgs in 2 weeks) but my friends are telling me that i am going to create a bigger problem for my body in future.

My husband says this is how he lost his weight and supports me but my friends are always trying to make me eat.

What should I do? Should I really eat more or is this type of eating ok?

Btw i eat sallads, meat/chicken, eggs and vegetables? Also i drink milk with my coffee? And i try to get balance with my micro and macros?

Thank you all!

1m54u74,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1m54u74/the_night_time_security_guard_is_not_humanpart_1/,The Night Time Security Guard is NOT Human(Part 1),"I’m unsure if anyone will believe me, but I must get this off my chest. My name is Michael, and recently I started a job as a security footage reviewer for a tech company called Endotech, which is well-regarded for its treatment of its employees. It’s not a massive conglomerate, but it’s pretty well-known in the area for being a pleasant company to work for. Besides the pay being above average compared to most other companies, there wasn’t much to go on in the job description. I wasn’t that knowledgeable about what I was going to be doing; all I knew was I would be looking at security footage, and with the pay it offered, it was a good opportunity for me, especially since I just moved to the area and was in desperate need of a job.
After getting back an email from Mr. Hostel, the boss, we scheduled an interview. Though I was anxious, the day came closer and closer until it was time to go, so I put on my most professional attire and drove off to the 5-floored building brandishing the words Endotech in a soft blue LED that looked like it could come straight from a sci-fi movie, its light bleeding onto the building like it could swallow it whole in a matter of days.
As I walked through the interior doors, the dirty-blonde receptionist with soft blue eyes sitting at the sleek wooden desk noticed my presence and—before she could ask why I was there—Mr. Hostel walked in behind me, exclaiming, “Michael, right on time, just like I thought you’d be. Follow me up to my office; we can discuss the details of your possible employment here,” he said with a sense of pride.
“Of course, sir.” I followed in suit behind him, walking past the receptionist; as I did, she gave me a smile and a nod of encouragement, and as we walked the halls, I felt like there were too many doors and hallways; they seemed to split off in every direction like a maze that once lost in, you’d never be able to find your way out of.
The innards of the building almost resembled an old hospital building as we walked the cold, white halls with the long echoes of silence and footsteps trailing behind us like an unknown entity crawling behind you, desperate to grab you at first chance, only to slowly fall behind further and further, never to be heard from again.
As we arrived at the elevator, the path seemed long and felt narrow, closing in on us more and more as we got closer to the elevator doors. Once we got there, we took the elevator up to the 4th floor and continued on our venture, passing more doors, some open and some closed, the open ones showing an office-like interior with large windows panning the walls, the inside stuffed with frozen grey cubicles filling the floor space.
In the corner of one of the rooms, a younger gentleman sat, maybe finishing work or maybe packing up; I couldn’t tell in the 3 seconds it took for us to walk past the door as we ended our journey at Mr. Hostel’s golden nameplate, dark brown wooden door. We entered his office; it was reasonably large for the area the building was in. He sat down while I got comfortable in the chair in front of his desk.
He moved some papers around, and while doing so, asked me if I was ready to start the interview, to which my response elicited his explanation of information containing history about the company, its founder, what we did, and what I was going to be doing in the position I applied for. I was immediately put at ease. Mr. Hostel was a very charming and friendly; he was about 5’6’ with a balding head and pearly white teeth that could be fake.
He said, “Don’t worry too much about the small stuff; your job won’t be too hard since the AI gives you the scraps. Just watch a couple of videos every day and make sure to keep up on your logs. He told me they have a program that separates the footage and that I would be combing through the miscellaneous footage for anything out of the ordinary, just as an insurance measure, since nothing works a hundred percent of the time.”
I was relieved to hear that I wouldn’t have to watch hundreds of hours of workers typing on computers and printing out paper. Not that it matters, as I would get paid either way, but the thought of watching someone else work felt extremely boring.
After explaining everything, he got up, shook my hand, and said, “I look forward to working with you. Your references and resume give us confidence in choosing you for the position. Congratulations and welcome to our company.” He shook my hand as he gave me the job. I was so excited I must’ve looked like a kid on Christmas, beaming ear to ear, but knowing I wouldn’t be out on my month’s rent was something I couldn’t not be excited about.
I shook his hand, thanking him for his time and the opportunity. I walked back to the elevator, took it to the first floor, walked down the cold, dead halls, the echoes of my feet reverberating in the silence behind me, and as I walked past the receptionist, I smiled and nodded before walking out and driving home.
Walking into my 3-bed, 2-bath apartment, I breathed a sigh of relief knowing my money problems would soon be over. I slumped onto my bed, undid the tie on my dark grey suit with matching pants, and the sweat stains lining the white undershirt I had been wearing soaked like a waterfall sprouted under my arms from how anxious I had felt waiting for the interview.
Kicking off the stuffy shoes, I finally felt like I could relax. My prayers were answered, and I finally got a job.
My first day came up fast. I arrived 10 minutes early, walking into the office to see the hustle and bustle of office workers clocking in, getting coffee, and heading to their rooms to start the day. The day before, Mr. Hostel emailed me the information I would need for my first day. He told me I was to go to the receptionist and ask her to call Eddie and inform him that the new footage guy was in and needed to be shown the ropes.
I went in and introduced myself to the receptionist, learning her name was Leslie. Leslie called Eddie, his charisma leaking through the phone in the short 2-minute conversation she had with him. I could hear his voice from down that hall as he hung up, and he was saying good morning and hello to the workers coming in for their shift as he walked to the waiting area.
My first impression upon seeing Eddie was that he was a tall, brown-haired guy with prominent dimples on his cheeks. He had a nice smile and intense, dark green eyes. He was charismatic and kind.
As he reached out to shake my hand, he introduced himself. “Hey, Michael. Good to meet you. My name’s Eddie. I’m unsure if Mr. Hostel already told you my name; either way, I’m the tech head, and Mr. Hostel asked me to guide you to your area and show you what you will be doing. If you want to follow me, I’ll show you how to clock in and where to go.”
I followed him to the clock-in area; he gave me my tag, swiped it into the small box, clocked in, and guided me to my location. It was a small room on the first floor at the end of the hall, stacked with monitors, a small cabinet, and a single chair.
“It’s not the greatest thing in the world, but it’s not the worst. I’ve seen worse; trust me, there was one room we used to have that had servers lined the walls, and in the back was where you would work. The place was like a sauna, and there was a cute old box TV with a VCR on top of it. A couple of the other tech guys and I would bring in old tapes and play them until one of my old sitcoms got caught and we couldn’t use it anymore. Sad times,” he said with a chuckle before logging me into my computer and showing me where the footage would be and what I was looking for.
It was pretty simple instructions. I would log in, open the folders, and watch the footage. That was about it; I was to ensure everything was up to par and nothing was out of the ordinary. I would then write the name of the footage, the date I reviewed it, and my signature for some authenticity.
After he showed me what to do, he told me to hop to it and try not to get too bored. He told me where the bathroom and break room were and said I could walk around, but before he left, he said, “Glad to be working with you, Michael. Just one word of advice before you start working here: don’t go to the fifth floor. Only the bosses are allowed up there, and no one else is allowed, so if you see anyone, let Mr. Hostel or me know about it. If you’re caught up there without the right clearance, you’ll lose your job immediately and be escorted off the premises, but with that, I’ll leave it to you, and I’ll see you around. He patted my back, said, “Don’t be a stranger,” and walked away.
Following Eddie’s instructions, the first month passed. I did my job, watched the footage, logged it, got paid, paid my rent with a sigh of relief, and made sure to stay clear of the fifth floor, which wasn’t all that hard. I talked to Eddie and Leslie and got to know them better. Leslie was a cute, dirty blonde with blue eyes. She had a good sense of humor and was flirtatious; she liked to joke around with everyone like Eddie, but she would find herself touching your arm or laughing while touching your shoulder. Nothing anyone didn’t like. They introduced me to some of our coworkers and showed me around the building. All in all, I was starting to enjoy my new place of work; everything was pretty great up until around the three-month mark, when things started to get a little odd, to say the least.
Most of the footage I was allocated to review was of the front room guards and the night security, along with some empty halls and busy workers. Still, oddly enough, the majority of the footage was of the fifth floor, and there was always one security guard on the cameras. I believe his name was Terrence; he was an older Asian gentleman with greying hair that only covered the sides of his head—the top was bald. He was a shorter man with a slight bend in his posture. I didn’t think much of it, but I noticed he would go up to the fifth floor around the same time every night. It wasn’t all that out of the ordinary, considering his job.
I was curious about how he was allowed up there, so I thought I’d ask about him. However, I couldn’t find him, so I decided to ask Leslie about old man Terrence, and she told me he had been there even before her and that he’s been the overnight security guard since the company was started. I asked her if she knew him personally, and she told me no. So I asked her why he was allowed on the fifth floor, and her response startled me. Her face tightened, looking full of malice, her eyes squinting tightly like she needed glasses. The whites of her eyes took on a yellow hue, and her pupils were wide, as if she were staring into a bright light. Her tone also changed; she wasn’t cheery and flirtatious but cold and serious. She spoke to me as though I had offended her beyond belief.
“You shouldn’t ask about old man Terrence that much; if you do, you’ll start to upset many people. Everybody in the building likes him, and he’s nice. If you’re curious, I’d ask him yourself, because none of us will tell you anything more than I already have.”
After that, her face relaxed, her eyes returned to normal, and the color bled back into her skin. Strangely enough, she acted as though we hadn’t just had that conversation, asking me how my day was and what I was up to. The entire interaction threw me for a loop. I wasn’t sure what to do after that. Unsure of how to respond, I told her I was heading to the bathroom and said I’d see her later. I left, doing my best not to react or act out of character.
I wasn’t sure what to make of my interaction with Leslie. She felt inhuman in that moment, as though if I had turned my back on her, she could’ve eaten me whole and not a soul in the world would’ve been any the wiser. I decided to stop asking questions about the old man, fearing that Leslie’s warning might be my final one. Once that decision was made, I steered clear of ever seeing or mentioning old man Terrence to another person in the building. I wasn’t even sure if I could ask Mr. Hostel about him, either out of fear or terror that maybe his reaction would be even more extreme.
The thought of losing my job over asking a question put a fear in my heart that a shower and a warm dinner couldn’t shake. I went to bed that night thinking that maybe my job wasn’t as simple as I thought it would be. I spent the next couple of days in a paranoid fear that someone might be watching me. Leslie’s warning included “none of us,” which meant there were more people I had to be careful around. Unsure and scared, I decided to mind my own business, opting to clock in, work my shift, clock out, and go home.
As I watched more and more footage, old man Terrence appeared more frequently—as if he were in every clip. I believe the AI program designated him as miscellaneous since he mostly stands around doors watching the entrances or walking down the halls, seemingly doing nothing for hours. Until 2 a.m. came, and he would walk to the fifth floor, disappear behind a door, and not be seen again for the rest of the night.
I tried my best to ignore him, choosing to watch the footage and log it as though it was normal. But I started to notice that things seemed off with Terrence. It wasn’t anything obvious—it was more like a feeling. An odd sense that something was wrong with him. And it made me want to pay more attention and watch his actions closely.
Sometimes, I would notice his skin looked darker and had a rougher texture. His veins looked solid, almost like they were fighting against his flesh, trying to escape the confines of his wrinkled skin. His walk was strange—like if an infant were born an adult. His knees wouldn’t bend correctly, and his center of gravity seemed off. Sometimes his knees bent slightly backward, like a flamingo’s, or curved outward toward his sides just enough to look unnatural. It wasn’t every time, but enough to throw me off and creep me out.
I remember one night he stood in the dark at the end of a hallway, just staring. There were no sounds or motion in the hallway. But the microphones picked up his voice—he was mumbling in a way that didn’t make sense. He said words, but they had no meaning—like a jumbled language made audible. It sounded like vibration was his first language. Every time I tried to rewatch the footage, I’d get a splitting migraine and have to stop.
Around a week after another incident—where I saw his arms stretch longer than what should be humanly possible—I decided I needed a second opinion. Maybe it was just camera glitches. Or maybe something else. Either way, I needed someone to confirm that I wasn’t going crazy. So I asked Eddie to take a look at the footage with me. I needed the support. Even if nothing seemed obvious, it was gnawing at the back of my mind, and I couldn’t shake it. Since Eddie was our main tech lead—and my closest friend at the office—I figured he was the best person to ask.
Eddie entered my little camera viewing room, his relaxed demeanor calming me slightly as he walked up to my corner full of monitors.
“Hey Eddie, thanks for coming. I know I emailed you immediately—sorry about that.” I felt a little bad calling him in during his lunch break, but I wasn’t sure when else he could’ve helped.
“No worries, Mikey. I can eat whenever I want. I usually just take my lunch to smoke anyway, so no harm, no foul. But what’s this about some footage you wanted me to take a look at?”
“Yeah, I’ve got some footage set aside that’s been bugging me, and I wanted your input. It’s of the night security guard, old man Terrence—it just seems odd.”
“Oh, old man Terrence,” Eddie replied. “I haven’t seen him in a while since they moved him to night duty. He used to be a front office guard, but I guess he got too old and switched shifts.”
As he watched the footage, his demeanor shifted slightly, though I couldn’t tell exactly how. Then he said, “Doesn’t seem like anything out of the ordinary, Mikey. Maybe all these blue lights are starting to burn the visuals into your brain,” he joked, his eyes never leaving the screen—staring with laser focus, like a hunter locked onto prey.
I chuckled. “Yeah, you’re right. Maybe I need to start wearing blue light glasses before my brain fries.”
Even though Eddie said nothing was wrong, it didn’t satisfy the itch I had hoped it would. Something still felt wrong, but I couldn’t put my finger on what. As Eddie left the room, he said, “Don’t worry too much about old man Terrence. He’s been around since the company came to town, and I can guarantee there’s nothing wrong with him—and nothing wrong with the footage. I put those cameras up myself and do weekly maintenance.”
As Eddie walked away, I muttered that maybe he was doing more damage than maintenance. From the distant, echoed halls, I heard his faint laughter trailing behind him.

July 12^(th), 1823

When I left London in the autumn of 1817, I was unprepared for what was to transpire. As such, I must preface this journal. I am not proud of what happened, and it has remained on my mind ever since. I warn any that would read this that, despite the fantastical nature and implausibility of what I witnessed, I maintain that every word written hereafter is the truth as I experienced it.



As I intend to keep this journal hidden until my death, both in hopes of maintaining some modicum of dignity and ensuring that my crimes are judged only by the highest power, I feel that I should introduce both myself and Silas.



For much of the war I maintained something of a correspondence with my old friend, Silas. I met him at University back in 1808 and together we shared a passion for anthropology, brandy, and cigars. We exchanged perhaps one letter every month or two as the packet ships allowed, he keeping me informed of his research and discoveries within the field.



As I had set out for Portugal in 1810, he had pressed me to undertake research parallel to his own; to examine the folklore of the peasantry in the rural backwaters that the war would no doubt bring me to. Throughout much of the Iberian campaign, encouraged by Silas’ letters, I did just that. Whilst my mind is incomparable to those of many of my contemporaries, I wrote some papers that became well liked amongst certain circles in London and Oxford, a fact of which I remain quite proud.



However, by ‘13, I was much fatigued in both mind and spirit. One conclusion that I drew from the war was that a mortal man can only witness so many horrors before he loses some piece of himself irrevocably. The violence I was witness to, that I myself sometimes undertook, I felt had marked my soul in some fashion. It left me with a darkness, a pox on my spirit, and I believed at that point that I should never know heaven.



The occurrences that fill the rest of this journal have made me quite certain.





October 27^(th), 1817



It has been now two months since I returned from Holland. I have taken it upon myself to resume my correspondence with Silas. Though I have not put ink to paper for some years now, Silas’ unapologetic enthusiasm has reinvigorated me. Half pay was damning to me, so I sold my commission, but I have accomplished nothing since. My mother had arranged work with a banking firm, but I have not taken up the offer. I have been melancholic, filling my days with laudanum and drink.



Yet Silas’ most recent letter has offered a far more tantalising opportunity. He has been in Scotland for some months, seeking to write a study on Gaelic folklore, and his notes and initial translations are utterly fascinating. In his letter he asks me to travel to the village where he’s quartered, and assist him with his research.



As I am still rather flush with money and have no real prospects in London, I mean to accept his offer. I am certain the fresh air and country living will do wonders for my mind.



November 10^(th), 1817



Nearly a fortnight spent in a coach has left me near crippled. I should think I’d rather march over the Pyrenees again than make such a journey at such speeds. Nevertheless, I am staying but a day’s travel from my destination, some small and unpronounceable village in the Highlands. I have had to hire a wagon for tomorrow, laden as I am with a cask of brandy, case of cigars, and a sack of good coffee along with my notes and conventional luggage.



I am much looking forward to resuming my rapport with Silas. Though he may be a papist, mason, and, worst of all, an Irishman, he has a most generous soul and a quick-witted humour. He is cousin to many well-respected men of science, and has become well-renowned for his own work.



On another note, the language here is wondrous. Guttural and primitive, yet I feel in some ways it shares a similarity to Portuguese, though I understand not a word of it.



November 11^(th), 1817



The village is smaller even than I expected. Perhaps twenty houses, all of rough undressed stone, perched on a long and low ridge in the shadow of some notable mountains, already with a dusting of snow. A few crude wooden barns are on the south side. There is no church or even chapel, and the remnants of a castle stand on one of the smaller peaks about three miles north.



The villagers themselves farm a few fields around the village before they give way to rolling moors, yet the majority of them are shepherds. The men often go in coarse skirts, and all of them are large and dull stock, the sort of peasant that has been unchanged for centuries or longer, untouched by the hand of civilisation.



It is easy to share Silas’ passion for them. Though I speak not a word of their language, their manner is clearly alien to English sensibilities. The land is dotted with stone cairns and carved standing stones, and the doors of the houses are decorated with sprigs of rowan and small wheels of iron.



Silas himself has changed greatly. He was always a stocky, well-built man, yet now he has the ruddy complexion of a drinker many years his senior, and he is now fat as a hog. Nevertheless, it was a wonderful reunion.



As my wagon driver unloaded my copious luggage, the people gathered, crude shawls and coats pulled tight against the biting wind. Yet not one of them stepped forward to help, they merely stood, as skittish as deer.



From one of the houses Silas came roaring, welcoming me with a strong handshake and coaxing two village boys at last into helping me with my belongings.



Silas was now telling the names of everyone we passed, there being around fifty people in the village, and of those names I remembered none. We entered the house which he and I would be staying. It had a single room with a low ceiling and small hearth, a pair of crude chairs set facing it. By the small window beside the door was a large table covered with hundreds of papers, mostly illustrations, and a lock-box around the size of a ledger. The back half of the building was covered by a canvas partition, behind which, he assured me, a truly horrible bed awaited.



From then, he introduced the old woman he’d employed as housekeeper, Euphan. She spoke no English, and seemed slow witted, and the slope of her cranium under her thinning hair would certainly make a fascinating study for a phrenologist.



Then, she brought for us a good leg of mutton and some cabbage, which I devoured, hungry as I was from the travel. After, Silas and I settled by the fire with some brandy and cigars, and he began to talk.



Firstly, he reacquainted me with his research, telling me of the ancient pre-Christian beliefs and gods that were still known through myths and seen in their superstitions. At this I mentioned the small iron wheels and sprigs of rowan I saw on the doorways, and he acknowledged that it was a ritual to drive away malevolent spirits.



“And I noted you also have the same bauble on your door.” I said.



“Indeed. The locals become quite disturbed should I not partake. They are a simple people and it is best to allay their fears.”



I nodded, then Silas took his watch from his vest and remarked as to the time.



“A few rules, if you’ll oblige me.” He said.



“Certainly.”



“Avoid the castle, and don’t venture out of the village once it’s dark. The local wolves up in the mountains have killed a number of sheep, and are thought to have killed a girl last year. Especially in winter, they can be quite aggressive.”



“Wolves have been extinct for over a century, have they not?” I asked.



“That is the common conception. However-” he retrieved something from his pocket and handed it to me.



In my hand was what indeed appeared to be a handkerchief-sized piece of cured animal skin, and the dense gray fur certainly looked like that of the wolves I’d seen in the Pyrenees.



Silas continued, “There is a small but vicious pack in the mountains. We killed that one last winter, but more have been seen. They seem to be denned around the castle.”



I could hardly reject the evidence in my hands, so I agreed to what seemed reasonable demands, and assured Silas I’d keep my pistol on me at all times.



“And you mustn’t go out when there’s fog.”



“Are there wolves hiding in the fog too?” I japed, which elicited a chuckle from Silas.



“Not quite. The fog rolls in damnably fast, and a number of people have become very lost. We normally find them a day or two later, and they are always quite shaken. But some are less lucky, and die out on the moors.”



It was a grim note to end the evening on, but I look forward to the morning.



November 12^(th), 1817



I was woken with a start by Silas’ morning ablutions. The bed had lived up to its promise; coarse wool blankets over hay. I slept poorly, as happens in the absence of laudanum, and had the usual nightmares, of smoke-wreathed battlefields and horses foaming at the bit, of roundshot gouging bloody terror into my company, and of stinking bloated bodies piled high in whitewashed plazas.



This morning was quite clear, if somewhat overcast, with a hard coating of frost making the moors and mountains pale in the paler light. We breakfasted on bread and cheese and Euphan was able to make a palatable pot of coffee. We went first to a large building that served as a town hall, where to my pleasure I met a few local men who had a fair grasp of English.



Unfortunately there was ill news that morning. A shepard girl had not returned the previous day, and Silas told me that the town assumed wolves had attacked her. I saw many around that room grasping at small trinkets of iron and covering their eyes with a hand.



From Bombay to Mexico, men fear death. I have seen that fear many times, in many faces. In faces of friends, and sometimes in the face of a stranger at the end of my sword or pistol. It seems to me a perverse juxtaposition that even godly, Christian men, in their last moments, give in to some baser instinct beyond the word of God and the promise of heaven.



Until today I thought I had grown to accustomed to seeing that expression to feel much, yet the looks on the faces of those villagers this morning made my blood run cold.



After that meeting, Silas left to speak with some of the villagers, so I returned home. Euphan was sweeping when I arrived and croaked something at me, gesturing to Silas’ work table. I was unable to comprehend what it was that she expected for me, so I smiled and shook my head and she stopped. From there, I went to my luggage and withdrew my pistol, powder flask, and some shot.



It is only a simple Elliot pattern pistol, usually issued to dragoons, but it’s clip fit well to my belt, and with the ammunition in my pockets, I decided to walk the moors.



On the way through the town I encountered a youth, Rory, who had some schooling when staying with his aunt in Edinburgh and had a fair grasp of English. He seemed to be somewhat grieved by the news, and so I felt obliged to ask:



“Were you sweet on her?”



The boy wrung his hands “Not like that, not really, but she was sweet, and rare pretty too. A good lass.”



The boy agreed to join me on my walk, and I let him hold my pistol, much to his joy. The air was fresh and crisp that morning, rich with the scent of wild heather and grass. The ground itself had a springiness to it as we walked somewhat aimlessly north-east, towards the woods that dotted the base of the mountains.



The boy was fascinated by the service, as boys are prone to be, and he asked a great deal of questions about muskets and cannons and the navy ships I’d been on and the French.



“Is it true that they stink and their teeth are all rotted?”



“No, no more so than us, at least.”



Rory nodded. “I t’ain’t never seen a Frenchman.”



“They are the same as us, for the most part, with the exception of their language.”



The boy nodded amiably, and upon his insistence I rolled up my hose to show the scar in my calf from a musket ball I’d taken at Waterloo.

“Did it not come out t’other side, then?”



“No. It was shot at a very extreme range, and it was all but spent when it hit me. Otherwise, I dare say I’d have lost the whole leg.”



We talked more as we entered the copse of pine and rowan and ash. The smells of heather and grass gave way to the richness of sap and leaf litter. It was then that Rory asked me the question I’d been both expecting and dreading.



“Did y’ever kill anyone?”



For a moment I had to stand still, and all the air rushed out of me as if I’d taken a blow to the gut. The world around me seemed to tilt, and I swear for a moment my shirt and coat were gone, the cool breeze changed. I was standing between walls, whitewashed and bloodstained, in my reeking, stuffy uniform under the still heat of the Spanish sun, and as the Highlanders of the 71^(st) Foot charged with bloodied bayonets around me, I was looking into the eyes of a terrified young French officer as we faced one another with swords drawn.



“Yes.” I said, barely more than a whisper. “The first time was at a village in Spain. It’s not a pleasant memory, I’m afraid.”



The boy seemed puzzled by this. He said that there’s honour in fighting for ones country, or other words to that effect. In truth it’s not something soldiers often spoke of. They joke around the subject, to be certain, but precious few enjoy discussions of killing, except for those base killers who are divorced from humanity and take pleasure in cruelty and violence.



I told the boy. “He was an officer. We were both lieutenants, around the same age, probably only a few years older than you are now.” The boy listened keenly.



“It was terrifying. We were both utterly besides ourselves with fear. He came at me with a few chops, and I just kept stepping back. Then I lunged at him, and he started babbling. Crying. Then I pierced him.”



I poked Rory with my finger.



“Right there. Then he dropped his sabre, starting crying. I kept stabbing at him, and his blood began to run down his front. He was screaming, and I think I was screaming too. I don’t know how many times I stabbed him, but then he sat down in the road, gurgling, then. He just starting talking, begging me not to kill him. *Pitié… pitié… me tuez pas… faut que j’voie ma mère… j’lui ai dit… j’lui ai dit que j’rentrerais…* That’s what he said. That he promised his mother he’d come home.”



Rory stared at me, and I saw in his eyes my words had found some meaning.



We kept walking, my heart heavy.



And that’s when we found her.



There was a feeling, as we approached that clearing, like the tension before lightning. In retrospect, it was like some sense of foreboding had entered me as I had talked to Rory.



She was sitting on the ground facing away from us. Her gold hair ran down her back like water.



I had already put my hand on Rory’s shoulder as he shouted her name and tried to run to her.



When you see a corpse for the first time you realise that there is something divine in life, some spark of god, and when you die that fades.



I knew she was dead the instant I saw her.



I shook the boy, shouted at him, and sent him running back to the village for help.



And then I was alone as the slapping of his feet fell away.



Alone save for the girl.



I stepped up to her, and in front of her.



What had killed her was no wolf, nor any of god’s creatures. She was pale, almost blue, her milky eyes staring forward into some unseen oblivion. In life, no doubt she was very pretty, but in death a body becomes instantly twisted and unsettling. Her flawless face, her fine nose, her large eyes, all of them compounded to make a truly hideous sight.



There was no mark on her, no wound. No sign of violence. It was as if she had simply sat down in that clearing and life had abandoned her.



Gently, I laid her on her back, stiff though she was, and I closed her eyes.



Then I sat over her, and I prayed.



The villagers came after around an hour. They said nothing, but stood around us. Silas came forward, unusually grim, and put a hand on my shoulder. I lifted the girl, and she was so very light, far lighter than anyone I’d ever carried. The villagers followed in a silent, mournful procession, and Rory led the way without a word, tears streaming down his cheeks.



When we arrived, even the dogs were quiet, and I took the girl to her house, and her mother collapsed and wept and screamed and tore at her hair, whilst her father sat facing away from the world and the girl’s siblings held each other and cried.



The crying keeps going, even as I sit writing this.



Silas then took me home, and explained to me with some reserve that these people have strange and alien burial customs, that I should not interfere and let them act as is their way. I was puzzled, and asked what he meant.



“There are old stories here. Stories of the dead.”



“In what sense? That’s true the world over.”



Silas nodded, and took a good measure of brandy before he continued. “The Celtic peoples have a strong belief in spirits, revenants. There are things that must be done in order to ensure that the dead do not return.”



I sighed. “All peoples have similar superstitions.”

Silas looked at me. “And why might that be? What is there to fear from the dead? Why does god render unto us such fear?”



“To ensure that the dead are treated properly, buried correctly, prayed for.” I drank deeply from the amber brandy.



“And what do the dead do when they are treated poorly?”



Then conversation ended not long later. Neither of us were particularly convivial, and the brandy couldn’t coax an ounce of humour back into us.



November 13^(th), 1817



Last night I dreamt of a beautiful girl atop a castle. She had big eyes and blonde hair. She wore the uniform of a French infantry lieutenant and she begged for her life in a language I did not understand as I stabbed at her.



I awoke shortly after dawn to a great din in the village. People were moving, talking, some shouting. Silas was also awake, drawing at his desk, and Euphan was nowhere to be found, so I had to grind my own beans to brew the two of us coffee. Though by the time we’d drank it and eaten some biscuit all was quiet.



We left only to find the village now almost deserted, the morning clear and bright, traces of fog burning away beneath the weak winter sun. Euphan emerged from her hovel and pointed us along to the north east. On walking past the low stone houses of the village, we saw perhaps two miles distant, the villagers were working on a new cairn, not unlike the others scattered on the moors.



We approached, and found a bizarre sight.



The villagers seemed no longer mournful, but weary. The girl had been carried in a wagon, and was dressed in a simple white woollen dress, laying almost peacefully in the wagon. Just as perfect and beautiful and blue and unnerving as she had been when I first found her. The family were standing protectively by the wagon, as a big bearded fellow spoke demandingly, hefting a wood-axe. Rory stood on, helpless. The donkey that must have hauled the wagon was on the verge of bolting, ears back, teeth bared, and whining.



Silas grabbed my arm as he quickly exchanged words with the axeman. Then he turned to me.



“They are discussing… dismemberment.” He told me, not meeting my gaze.



“What?” I cried out.



“As I said last night. There are customs, rituals, that these people observe, to avoid the return of the dead.”



I shook my head. “But they want to cut her up like a flank of beef? That’s barbaric.”



“Quite, quite. Yet they have their beliefs. We are here to observe, don’t forget.”



The Axeman was pushing aside the family. I recalled in that moment, words I had exchanged years before. A sergeant I had met at the field of Waterloo, of the 33^(rd), had told me of his time in India. The Hindoo are afraid of dismemberment, as they believe that they could not enter their heaven unless they were whole. The man had told me gleefully how they had bound Hindoos to the front of cannon, and blasted them to pieces.



In that instant, looking down at that hideous, beautiful girl in the wagon, axeman poised above her, I brought up my pistol and pointed it at the man, dragging back the hammer to full cock.



“No.” I recall I said.



The villagers were quick enough to obey beneath my muzzle, and the girl was put into the ground, adorned with a sprig of rowan upon her breast. They buried her dutifully, and piled the stones six foot high, as the sun vanished behind the clouds and the world grew cold. None of them knew the pistol was not loaded.



Once the girl was interred, my pistol long since put away, and the sun having reached its zenith hours hence, the villages seemed to look to me, as if for guidance.



I looked to Silas. “Should I perhaps say a prayer?”



Silas exchanged some swift Gaelic, and was met with nods, men doffing their hats or tugging at forelocks. He nodded to me.



The sun was lowering in the cold sky, and I had read the words enough times to not need the book.



“Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name… Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our bread. Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is thy kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.”



The mourners mumbled their own amens, several even crossed themselves.



After, Silas and I returned home, and over a cigar and brandy, he looked over to me.



“Do you know what’s in my lock-box?”



I told him, truthfully, that I didn’t.



“There is research in there. Notes I made during my travels. Whilst you fought the French across Iberia, I travelled my native Ireland, and, for a short while in ‘13 and ‘14, I travelled across to America.”



I nodded. Our correspondence had become erratic in that time.



“I’ve heard strange tales the world over.” He continued. “A Chinese seaman told me of Jiungshee, a voodoo in New Orleans told me of rituals to raise the dead, a Moldavian I encountered aboard a ship told me of the Strigoi. I have become convinced that of all these stories and cultures, there must be some modicum of truth to them.”



Silas was leaning forward, and I could see how tired and old he appeared, with a feverish fire in his eyes.



I still am not sure how I felt. I remembered, after Waterloo, a prisoner, a Pole of the Polish Lancers, had killed a man he was imprisoned with. He’d bitten through his throat, and was covered in blood when we found him and threw him before a firing squad. The whole time, pale and wide eyed, he’d screamed that he was Vjesci, Vjesci.



“There are mad men anywhere, who seek to undo life or else play with death.” I said.



“Are you certain? I am sure. So very sure. There are things that defy both god and science. And I fear them.”



I found myself most perturbed by this revelation. I knew Silas to be a man of reason and learning. To hear him so swayed by the superstitions of savages and madmen was unexpected.



“How did the girl die?” He asked.



“Obviously, she became lost and froze to death in the night. I’ve seen men who died whilst standing in the winter of ‘11.” I was concerned that he even had to ask.



“But you carried the girl back. Did anything seem missing?”



“Missing?”



He looked at me. “Did she not feel too light?”



I shall not drink tonight.



November 14^(th), 1817



I awoke long before dawn. The dream I had was as violent and terrible as usual, but this time the violence was inflicted on me, by a young girl with golden hair.



As soon as I was dressed I departed the house. I do not know how to put it into words, yet I was certain something was wrong. That same feeling, the tension in my chest, had returned as I slept.



It was cold outside, freezing, frost lay over everything and my breath curled before me. The sky was clear, the stars bright and the moon pale and haloed in a symptom of the encroaching cold.



The village was almost deserted, save for Euphan, who was carrying a chicken no doubt meant to be my breakfast. I nodded to her and she stopped to watch me pass with eyes downcast.



I was heading north east, as my aching chest led me to it like iron to a lodestone.



Beyond the village was the dread silence of the night. Only the sound of the frost crunching beneath my boots followed me as I stalked across the land, the moors suffocated beneath a knee high fog.



The cairn was gone.



Where it should be there was nothing but the writhing fog. My feet found for me the stones, scattered as men are scattered by grapeshot.



I was at this point in a panic, half demented, and as I stalked back and forth my feet suddenly found no ground beneath them.



I fell, face first, into the girl’s open grave, and it was empty.



As my hands sought purchase in the freezing dirt, to push myself up, they closed around something.



By the light of the moon, as I extricated myself from the grave, I saw what was in my hand. A sprig of rowan, burnt now to charcoal.



Standing there, by that empty grave, I felt a wrongness like I’ve never known. I have seen many graves, often on a scale most couldn’t fathom, but something about this one moved me. There was a feeling of oppression that clamped around my heart, and I felt in that moment like a deer realising it’s being stalked.



I felt watched, perceived, and I looked around. But the moors were silent, devoid of any life.



I looked upwards, and there was the castle, a mile distant.



It was as if I could feel the castle itself watching me, casting a malevolent eye over my profaning of that empty grave.



My mind raced as my heart pounded against my ribs, and the castle watched my panic and judged me, as I fled back towards the village.



Not long after dawn, Silas arose, and I immediately told him that the grave was empty.



All colour drained from his face, and his breathing grew laboured.



“We must search every house in town.” I declared.



Silas looked at me sidelong, puzzled. “For what purpose?”



I couldn’t understand his confusion. “No doubt the girl has been exhumed by someone looking to sodomise the body.” It to me seems a logical answer. “I would start with any unwed men or boys, particularly those known to have a queer countenance.”



Yet Silas shook his head. “You shan’t find the girl. Not in any house here, if it is protected by iron and rowan.”



My rage came quite suddenly, though in retrospect it had been simmering for some time. “Damn you Silas! This is neither the time nor place for these superstitions! A crime has been committed, we must catch and punish the offender, then lay that poor girl back to rest.”



“I told you to respect these people, their beliefs. If you had not intervened at the burial this could all have been avoided.”



“Silas,” I pleaded, “Please. We are civilised men, men of learning. Can you not see that there is a far clearer explanation? One that does not involve myth and the returning of the dead?”



Silas breathed deeply before he answered. “I understand what you say and why. But I know these people, have lived among them for months now. These are a timid people, not given to violence or lust. I knew the girl too. She was popular, and the village protective of her. No one would have hurt her, nor sought out her body.”



He sat quietly for some minutes.



“There are things unknown to man.” He said at last. “I have found too much evidence for that these past years. Too many witnesses, too many accounts, from Louisiana to the Carpathians, to your own research in Iberia. The dead return, without the knowledge or permission of god.”



I wanted to shout, to protest, but the darkness in his eyes and the sorrow in his voice left no room disagreement.



And that’s when the shouting began.

We have no idea what caused it because he was boarding at a doggy daycare, but we provided his own food with detailed instructions and asked they not feed him anything else due to a sensitive stomach. They claim he ate his food all four days and didn’t vomit, but I find that hard to believe because we picked him up 8lbs lighter. 

Anyways..our vet sent us home with the following meds:
1. Augmentin
2. Zofran
3. Pepcid
4. Gabapentin
5. Advised to be on rice and boiled chicken diet and gave us 4 cans of purina proplan EN wet food to deliver the meds in little wet food meatballs

Day 1 of meds and diagnosis- calming down and seeing a positive change

Day2- After a morning and evening dose of meds our pup seemed to be making a turn for the better. However, several hours after he started straining to poop and having a continuous leakage of diarrhea. He would pass gas and immediately start to try and lick up what came out. To be clear we tried to constantly wipe it with frangrance free baby wipes. This was continuous for over 6 hours and then we made the decision to bring him to an emergency weekend vet. The vet was concerned about dehydration and sent us home with a sub q injection of fluids and antidiarrhea meds to add onto med rotation. The leakage and constant trying to lick persisted for the next 24 hours and we resorted to buying a lot of doggy diapers and changing them out very frequently to keep him from licking. 

Day 3 (today) - he is still very uncomfortable but loose stool is not as frequent. He still won’t drink water, but I’ve soaked his rice and chicken in no flavored pedialyte and watered it down to try and help. 

My main concern right now: the poop/leakage must be so acidic or the pancreatic enzymes are eating away at his skin. I’m terrified that he’s still having extreme damage done internally. How do I help mitigate this on his outward skin. If I am able to comment a picture of his snout to give context to what his anus and under tail look like due to the burning I will. Think pink and raw. 

Every time he has leakage I am cleaning with a warm compress and then applying a super thick coat of aquafor the create a barrier. Please send any suggestion or ways to help make our guy more comfortable. I can tell he’s in pain and it breaks my heart. ",1,1753057685.0,AskVet,1,1.0,False

My husband is genuinely incredible in many ways. He’s consistently kind - he’ll give me his AirPods when mine die, brings me coffee all the time, does the dishes almost daily, makes food, and really tries to take care of me. I feel so lucky to be married to him.

That said, I have started to have a bad feeling about our lack of intimacy and his porn use, and I don’t know how bad it is.

When we first got together, I didn’t really know about it. I just noticed he spent a long time in the bathroom, about 45 minutes to an hour and a half each day. Eventually, I realized he was locking the door at specific times, even though we often shower together, and that he usually came out more relaxed or in a better mood afterward. 

Over time, I’ve started noticing patterns: when he’s tense or antsy, he’ll go to the bathroom and come back cheerful and like everything is fine. We don’t have sex very often, and while some of that is circumstantial, it also feels like he gives me just enough to keep me satisfied without really initiating or being fully present sexually.

Yesterday, something happened that I don’t know how to interpret. We had sex earlier in the day, and then again later (yay, unusual!) 

We were on a tight deadline to pack up before a trip,  but we were suddenly having sex again and I was loving it. At a natural lull point, I said something playful like “how about we finish packing and come back and play more and do [insert thing he’s been wanting to try].” I double checked if he wanted to finish then, and he said no, let’s go pack up, and put on music and make it fun like I suggested. He agreed, but as soon as I got up, he went to the bathroom. Fifteen minutes in, I realized what was happening, and he was in there another hour while I was left packing and cleaning. As usual, he came out all happy and relaxed. I felt hurt because I had explicitly asked if he wanted to wait until after packing to finish, and he had agreed. But instead, he went to the bathroom and used porn instead. I was genuinely excited to continue after packing, but of course we were then late so there was no time. 

I was raised super conservatively where all I ever heard was “porn is bad.” Now, as an adult, I’m trying to sort out what’s reasonable and healthy in a relationship. I don’t want to overreact or police his behavior, but I also feel a disconnect and a bit of deception here that I don’t know how to navigate.

Aside from this, and one other difference where I’m more active and he’s more of a homebody, he’s a phenomenal partner. I just don’t know how serious this issue is or how to talk about it in a way that’s fair to both of us.

How common is this? Is it possible to have a healthy marriage where one person requires daily porn use? How do other couples navigate differences in porn use and intimacy?

We have all known each other either since high school or college and her behavior is beginning to escalate from nervous to paranoid. For the rest of the story my friend will be referred to as Anna (fake name). 

Recently Anna’s tried to get me and my friends to sign contracts stating that if we visit her apartment we can’t sue her if we get hurt. Three things, first is that me and my friends have never threatened, insinuated, or have even gone through lawsuits. While I am sure I don’t know everything about my friends, I have known them for quite a while and know that suing someone is not who they are. They are all huge nerds who play board games, watch anime, and have PowerPoint parties. The biggest fight our group has had is over UNO rules. So the idea that any of them, including myself, would sue is unbelievable. 

Second, none of us have ever gotten hurt at her place. We occasionally go over, play board games or watch a movie, and leave. Not really injury worthy activities. She lives in a nice apartment, so there is nothing there that can really injure us. We don’t even always go to her place. We make sure to rotate and if you aren’t hosting you buy food to make it fair.

Third, Anna does not practice law. So these “contracts” were written on lined paper stating we are not allowed to sue her. I do accounting work so I have a very vague understanding of what a contract needs to be legitimate and this was not it. It leads me to believe that this was an anxiety escalation rather than a legitimate belief. 

We all basically stated we are not signing it and we could go over to someone else’s place if it makes her nervous to have people under her roof. She then started yelling at us saying that we must have been planning to sue her because we are too scared to sign the contract. We all left after that. 

For reference she has been sued before by her current girlfriend for emotional damage after their first breakup (don’t worry the case was thrown out as it didn’t hold up even slightly), even after the case got thrown out Anna decided to get back with her girlfriend. Before anyone in the comments says it, there is not one friend Anna has that likes her current girlfriend. We have all set boundaries at this point saying we do not want to see her for various reasons. 

Because of all this I invited her for coffee and I told her she needs to start seeing a therapist. I told her she is lashing out and spiraling. I made sure to emphasize that stress is normal but not at the levels I have been seeing recently. She immediately got mad at me asking if I thought she was crazy and when I said I just think she’s stressed and needs help, she left the cafe. 

I feel like I did the right thing, but am I misinterpreting something? I can be bad at reading situations, but this is someone I’ve known for almost 10 years and I don’t want to throw our friendship away over this.

For years, my coffee routine has revolved around a Keurig Essentials, but I'm finally ready to move on. I'm trying to reduce my plastic use and, honestly, I'm craving a different coffee experience.

I've been drowning in information about different brewing methods, but I think I've settled on trying a glass pour-over coffee maker, similar to the one pictured. My main preference is to use paper filters over metal ones. The easier cleanup and less sediment in my cup are big draws for me. Plus, I am concerned about the diterpenes (cafestol and kahweol), which are the compounds that raise cholesterol and are largely removed by paper filters?

I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed with all the choices out there. If I go with a glass pour-over, what would you recommend as far as paper filters go? I'm open to suggestions for specific brewers, filters, or anything else that would enhance the experience as I'm completely new to this. 

Thanks in advance for your help!

CHAPTER ONE

Nia – Friday Night, Late October

The new neighbors arrived in the middle of the night.

Not the poetic kind of arrival—no soft headlights or murmured apologies. This was bright floodlights, slamming van doors, and two men arguing in what sounded like surround sound. She sat up in bed before she was fully awake, blinking toward the window as Zoey gave a low, annoyed bark from the foot of the bed.

“What the hell…” she mumbled, already swinging her legs over the side.

Her boyfriend, half-asleep, muttered something unintelligible into his pillow.

Out the bedroom window, the glow of the U-Haul lit up their shared driveway like a stage. Four people were unloading furniture with the kind of intensity reserved for last-minute movers or people who didn’t care how much noise they made. The low scrape of something heavy across pavement hit her chest like a car alarm.

“Seriously?” she hissed.

She padded barefoot to the living room and flicked on the porch light, just in case the cue was missed.

It wasn’t.

A tall man in a navy hoodie glanced up, pausing mid-step with what looked like a dining chair held over one shoulder. Their eyes met—just for a second—and Nia did what she always did when caught watching something she wasn’t supposed to: she raised her eyebrows like she was surprised he was there.

Her boyfriend came down the hall then, tugging on a hoodie. “Want me to say something?”

“Let’s both go,” she said, wrapping her cardigan tight and slipping on the clogs by the door.

They stepped outside into the cold, where the night smelled like damp concrete and stress.

“Hey,” Nia called, loud enough to be heard but not aggressive. “It’s almost one a.m.… Is this really happening now?”

One of the men—maybe the brother—stopped moving a rolled carpet and looked at her sheepishly. The tall one—hoodie, chair guy—set the chair down and walked over.

“Sorry,” he said, his accent light but noticeable. “The truck rental was delayed, and we couldn’t wait.”

“Couldn’t you at least keep it down?” her boyfriend added. “Some of us work in the morning.”

“Yeah, of course,” the man said, already nodding. “We’ll try to finish fast.”

He sounded sincere. Not irritated. Just tired.

Nia held his gaze for a second longer than she needed to. He had kind eyes, she noticed—annoyingly kind for someone who had woken her up with an armoire.

“Thanks,” she said, softer this time. “We’ve just had… a few chaotic neighbors.”

He nodded again, then turned and relayed something in another language—Gujarati, maybe—to the rest of the group. Their pace slowed.

She and her boyfriend went back inside. Zoey had already curled back up on the bed like nothing had happened. Typical.

As she settled under the covers again, Nia stared at the ceiling.

There was something about them. She wasn’t sure what yet—but something told her this move-in would matter in ways she couldn’t name.

By Saturday night, she was convinced they had moved in and vanished.

No footsteps. No furniture assembly. No kitchen clatter through the wall. Not even the thump of someone running up the stairs too fast.

Just silence.

It made her suspicious.

She didn’t like surprises when it came to neighbors. Last time, the surprise had been a drum kit and a poorly trained German Shepherd. Before that, someone who hotboxed the shed with the same playlist on loop every Friday.

She went about her day, half-expecting to hear something—an argument, a vacuum, a blender, anything. Instead, it was just Zoey’s paws clicking on the floor and the occasional gust of wind rattling the partition fence she had paid for herself. She made dinner, read a chapter of something she’d started three times already, and lit a candle with a scent called evening fig. By 9 p.m., the house felt too still.

She even stood in the hallway at one point, just listening.

Nothing.

“Maybe they’re ghosts,” she muttered.

Zoey didn’t even lift her head.

⸻

On Sunday afternoon, she gave in.

She wasn’t going to let a single bad start set the tone. It wasn’t her style. Plus, curiosity had been eating at her all weekend.

She made a coffee, took it to go in a travel mug, and walked the long way around the front, pausing for a second on the lawn as if that would make it less awkward.

The front door was open, screen shut. She knocked once—just enough to be heard. She could see someone’s shadow move inside before the door opened.

It was him—the tall one from the night before. Hoodie replaced by a plain dark tee. There was a slight smell of masala or cumin behind him, something warm and bright.

“Hi,” she said, shifting her weight. “I just—wanted to say sorry for the other night. We were kind of abrupt. It was late, and I guess we were cranky.”

He blinked, then smiled slightly. “No problem. We were loud.”

“You were moving. It happens,” she said. “I just wanted to say welcome, properly.”

“Thanks.” He opened the door a bit wider but didn’t step out.

“I’m Nia, by the way. We live on the other side. With the very barky dog.”

His smile warmed. “Scotch barked back this morning. So, fair.”

“Scotch?” she asked.

“Our dog. Husky mix. White and brown. Just turned four.”

“Same age as Zoey. They should meet sometime.”

“Sure,” he said. “Once we’re settled.”

There was a pause. The kind that’s hard to end without a script.

“Anyway,” she said, stepping back, “just wanted to say hi.”

He nodded. “Raj.”

She smiled. “Nice to meet you, Raj.”

She turned, half-expecting Zoey to be watching from the window like a jealous sibling.



CHAPTER TWO

Shared POV – Thursday, October 31st – Diwali & Halloween

The neighborhood smelled like burnt sugar and wet leaves.

It was the kind of fall evening that settled fast—sky smudged grey, air thin and cold, every porch lit up with paper skeletons or dollar-store cobwebs. On Nia’s side of the duplex, the jack-o’-lantern flickered gently, half-smiling into the dark. The bowl of candy was already half empty by six-thirty, and she wasn’t sure if that meant they were doing well or if kids were just greedy this year.

Her boyfriend was on the steps, hoodie up, handing out bars with the enthusiasm of someone pretending to like children. Nia watched from the door, sipping wine and laughing every time he guessed a costume wrong.

Across the lawn, the other side of the duplex glowed gold.

No Halloween decorations. No porch lights.

Instead, there were candles—small, flickering diyas—lined up neatly along the walkway. Orange marigolds in metal bowls. The smell of ghee, cardamom, something fried and fragrant that drifted over with the breeze.

It was the kind of warmth that didn’t ask to be noticed, but couldn’t be ignored.

Through the fence slats, Nia caught flashes of movement: people gathered in the backyard, maybe a dozen or more. Voices rising, laughing, then fading again. Not wild—just full.

There was music, too. Not loud. Just enough to reach her through the walls—a rhythmic beat, something bright and pulsing, threaded with voices she couldn’t understand but felt anyway.

She closed her eyes for a moment and let it wash over her.

⸻

Raj stood near the fire pit, hands in his pockets, watching his cousin attempt to light another diya without burning off his eyebrows. The backyard was crowded—extended family from Bedford and Dartmouth had come, bringing food and noise and stories. His sister had cooked for two days straight. His brother had hung string lights at 2 a.m. because “Diwali is still Diwali, even if the neighbors sleep at nine.”

No one seemed to mind the space. No one complained.

For a moment, Raj forgot where he was.

Then he looked toward the other side of the fence.

Their half of the yard was dark. Porch light on, jack-o’-lantern grinning, soft porch voices. He saw her silhouette—Nia—on the doorstep, glass in hand. Laughing at something her partner said. At peace.

He wondered if she could hear the music. If she recognized the beat. If she resented the sound or secretly leaned into it.

There was no way to know.

But when their eyes met—across flame and fence, porch and shadow—it lasted just long enough to register.

Not a greeting.

Not a moment.

Just… recognition.

⸻

Later, long after the candy had run out and the fire had burned low, Nia lay in bed and smelled spices in the air vents. She thought of the warmth on the other side of the wall. The laughter. The music.

It wasn’t envy exactly. More like… a memory.

She drifted off thinking of a courtyard in Ahmedabad, long ago. Gold light. Cracked tiles. Bells in the distance.

The front step had grown cold beneath Nia’s legs, but she stayed until the last round of trick-or-treaters passed.

“Pretty sure that was the same kid twice,” her boyfriend said, chewing on a mini Snickers.

Nia smirked. “Bold of you to assume I care.”

They shut the porch light off around eight and went inside, candy bowl now mostly wrappers. Zoey was at a kennel overnight—the first time in months. Nia hated the silence it left behind, the way it made the house echo. So, they drowned it out.

A Treehouse of Horror marathon was already queued up, and Nia curled into the couch with a throw blanket and a glass of cheap red. They knew every line—Homer in space, Bart’s evil twin—but it didn’t matter. It was tradition. Silly, predictable, steady.

Around them, the house throbbed faintly with distant sound. A bass beat through the floor. Voices rising from the other side of the wall. Not intrusive—just… present.

She muted the TV during commercials and listened.

⸻

On the other side of the wall, Raj led his uncle through the kitchen, Scotch trailing behind them, tail wagging like he’d been raised in this house all along.

“Basement?” his uncle asked.

Raj nodded. “Yeah, come see.”

He opened the door, flicked on the light, and winced slightly. The basement was half-finished—low ceilings, cool concrete, a soft echo that bounced off every step. The stairs creaked, and he made a mental note to oil them. Again.

“Not soundproof,” he admitted.

“Good for storage though,” his uncle said, poking the water heater approvingly.

Upstairs, his sister gave her cousin a tour of the bedrooms. The smallest had already become the prayer room, with marigold-colored cloth pinned above a shelf of framed gods. His cousin laughed at the house’s narrow hallway. “Classic Nova Scotia,” she said. “Everything’s just a bit too close.”

Raj liked it.

The upstairs windows looked out over the backyard—bigger than they’d expected, wide enough for Scotch to stretch his legs and for spring gardens to take shape. He imagined a lawn chair out there. A grill. Morning tea with sunlight cutting through the fence slats.

He heard someone laugh on the other side. A woman’s voice—brief, then muffled.

He wondered if she thought the same thing about the backyard. If she’d ever admit it.

⸻

By the time midnight crept in, both houses had settled.

Nia had dozed off for the end of Season 12. Her boyfriend was snoring lightly, TV still glowing. The wine glass on the coffee table was half full, the flame of her lavender candle just a stub.

Raj stood at the back door, watching the last of the diyas flicker out.

Scotch pressed his head against Raj’s leg, sleepy and full. Someone had given him too much paneer.

The house was warm now. Lived-in. Real.

And though Raj didn’t know it, on the other side of the wall, Nia was dreaming of yellow light and a fire she couldn’t see.

CHAPTER THREE

Raj – Early November

The house felt different now that everyone was gone.

The weekend had been loud—clinking metal bowls, tangled shoes at the door, cousins yelling across staircases, the sharp burn of clove oil in the air. Even Scotch had been overstimulated, spinning in circles through legs and open doors.

But now, on Monday evening, it was quiet. Raj stood in the kitchen, waiting for the rice cooker to click. His sister was upstairs on a call. His cousin had gone to the gym. His brother was already in bed with a podcast playing low.

The house held its breath.

Raj opened the back door to let the air out. Halifax smelled different after dark. Damp leaves, maybe. A hint of salt from the harbor, even this far up. He stepped outside barefoot, Scotch trotting out beside him.

The backyard felt huge in the dark.

Bigger than it had during the family tour. The string lights still hung across the fence from Diwali. A few had already gone out. He made a note to take them down. Maybe on the weekend.

Next door, her porch light was still on.

He could see her shape through the window—just a flicker. She moved like someone who wasn’t trying to be noticed but also wasn’t hiding. He didn’t know her name yet, but she was the one who’d come to the door on Sunday.

Nia. That was it. She’d introduced herself. Offered to let the dogs meet.

Once we’re settled, he had said.

He didn’t mean to lie. He just wasn’t ready.

⸻

On Tuesday morning, he heard music through the wall for the first time.

Not loud. Just a thrum of bass and something vaguely electronic—tempo too upbeat for how cold the air felt. He stood in the hallway and listened without realizing it, one sock half-pulled on.

Then the song changed. A softer melody, almost Greek in structure—he couldn’t name it, but it reminded him of his father’s old CDs, the ones they used to listen to in the shop during monsoon season.

He found himself wondering: Did she know what it meant to be far from home?

Then Scotch barked at nothing, and the moment passed.


CHAPTER THREE (continued)

Raj – Early November, Tuesday Morning

The work car wasn’t anything special—just a silver sedan with the city logo on the side and a clipboard wedged forever in the backseat. But it gave him a strange sense of pride, parking it in front of the house.

He parked it neatly that morning, lining it up between the faded curb lines the way his manager had once demonstrated like it was a sacred ritual. One tire too close to the driveway, though—just a little.

Scotch barked once through the front window, then immediately lost interest.

Raj had just locked the door when he heard her.

“Hi—excuse me?”

He turned.

She was standing on her side of the front walk, wearing boots, leggings, a long coat, and a high ponytail that made her look taller than she probably was. Mug in hand, dog-less this time.

“Sorry—just wanted to ask,” she said, pointing toward the work car. “If you could leave a bit more space near the curb when you park, that would be amazing. It’s kind of tight for two vehicles.”

Raj blinked. “Oh. Yeah, of course. Sorry.”

Her smile was polite. Noncommittal. Not unkind. “Thanks. It’s just a weird little corner.”

“No problem,” he said.

She nodded once and turned, already heading up the steps. As she reached the top, she added over her shoulder, “Have a good day.”

“You too,” he said, too quietly for her to hear.

He stood there for another moment, keys in hand.

It wasn’t the comment—it was fine. Reasonable. Normal.

It was the way she’d said it: all soft authority and clipped efficiency, like someone used to saying things exactly once and having them land.

It reminded him of his supervisor.

Or his older sister.

Or the woman at the Service Canada counter who didn’t look up when he’d passed his citizenship interview.

He walked to the car and adjusted it anyway.

Just an extra six inches.

But something about it stayed with him all day.


CHAPTER THREE (continued)

Raj – Tuesday Afternoon & Evening

Work that day was mostly follow-ups.

Overgrown hedges. A resident claiming their neighbor had built a deck too close to the lot line. Someone demanding to know why a shed had to be moved two feet to the left. Raj typed in notes, double-checked file numbers, flagged a complaint for a re-inspection.

He liked the rules. There was clarity in them. Permits either existed or they didn’t. Fences were either regulation height or not. It wasn’t personal.

He printed a compliance notice for a case he’d been following since July—fencing installed without a permit, six inches too high. Just like his supervisor said: “Half a foot can cause a lot of noise.”

He smirked at that.

Still, something about the morning’s exchange stuck in his ribs. Nia’s voice. The way she said “that would be amazing” like it was just short of “please don’t make me say this again.”

⸻

That evening, the house was calm again. His sister cooked while humming something in Gujarati. The pressure cooker hissed in the kitchen. His cousin was watching a game in the living room.

Raj stood near the front window, adjusting the curtain just enough to look out.

Her car was back. The same compact grey one with the reusable grocery bags still visible in the back seat. The porch light was off, but a warm yellow glowed in the front window.

Then came the bark.

Short. Sharp. Then two more in quick succession.

Zoey.

He didn’t know the dog well yet, but he could tell—it barked at everything. Leaves. Squirrels. Passing ghosts. Scotch barked back sometimes, more out of obligation than enthusiasm.

Still, the sound surprised him.

Not because it was loud. But because he liked knowing she was home.

He turned away from the window, annoyed at himself for even thinking that.

He wasn’t here to pay attention to his neighbor.

They said it looked fast, but ""shaky but they checked my old ones and it looked similar so i guess they weren't worried. I barely ate that day. I only had a coffee, but in the E.R before they drew blood I did have a few sour skittles, like 10 or so. Could that been the reason my glucose was 140 paired with the anxiety?

It started when I needed an antique white even weave and I only had bright white. What am I to do? Spend $19 on what I actually need? Of course not! Why do that when I can unknowingly start myself on a train that will cost me well over $100?!

So I cut some test squares off a bit of apparel linen I had and tried coffee and various teas.

It's a bit browner than antique white but as it's for something ancient Egyptian I figured it would work well :).

Then I needed to dye some shirts that had become stained. The shirts didn't go quite as well as I'd hoped, but I decided to pop in some aida and even weave I had thrifted for the hell of it. These are a combination of tied and scrunched.

I then realised I would love some galaxy type dye (and that somehow an addiction was born). I ordered bulk aida, I ordered more dye, I resigned myself to never having white laundry tiles again... Everything below ice dyed (some on coloured, some on white). I also did some floss and a dye bath one, but will put those in the reply. I did some sewing fabric too, but I'll skip that :)

This has happened before. Anxiety comes in waves. Completely stopped drinking coffee. A few days after the anxiety came and persisted it started to affect my stomach. Either diarrhea multiple times a day after eating, or no diarrhea but with cramping feeling in both sides of stomach. Eliminated bread and dairy in addition to coffee, no changes. 

Almost feels like stomach acid gets stuck to sides of stomach in addition to small poking/cramping feeling. Today I woke up with muscle spasms in back/ kidney area presumably due to anxiety/posture while sleeping. I’m going to go to urgent care if this doesn’t go away but of course that also gives me tons of anxiety. I’ve had every symptom of anxiety under the sun the past few years and it’s never anything more so I’m pretty sure it’s anxiety it’s just frustrating. 

I’ve had stomach issues with anxiety before, usually when on vacation away from home. Have diarrhea and it eventually goes away. I’ve never had it persist this long, where it’s bothering me even when I feel relatively calm. I’m on Zoloft, Buspirone, Clonazapam, and Mirtazipine, with Ativan as needed.

I’ve tried almost everything such as :  Candida diet, Carnivore diet, Natural anti fungals and oral anti fungals, Shower filter but unfortunately nothing worked. The only one thing that worked was probiotics supplements this thing is like a magic still I can’t believe I’m shocked it’s the Candida healer every day I see new improvement and feeling better then the day before. 

After researching I found out that imbalanced gut microbiome is the main cause of most diseases in humans also responsible for allergic reactions to certain types of food or products. After 3 days since I started taking my probiotics supplements my food allergic reactions finally disappeared. I’ve tried probiotics from natural sources such as yogurt and Apple cider vinegar for long time but unfortunately they didn’t work and I don’t recommend this way to any one having Candida unlike the supplements they contain very high amounts of beneficial bacteria and it’s the only solution if you want to see fast results take the probiotics supplements and you will see improvements just in 2- 3 days but make sure to continue the course 2-3 months and the dosage can range between 300 millions and maximum 10 billions per day. Good luck everyone !!





P.S : while taking probiotics avoid all acidic products such as Orange, Grapefruit, Lemon, Tomato juice and any acidic product. Also keep at least 2 hours before or after coffee / Tea

Hi! I [27F] moved to Toronto about a year ago and I’m currently living in North York. I’m looking to build meaningful, consistent friendships the kind where we can actually meet up regularly, share life, and support each other.

I’m naturally introverted, so I’m not into big party scenes, but I do love street festivals, live music, anime events, and cozy cafés. I’m also trying to be more active looking to join a sport or hobby club soon so if you're on a similar journey, even better!

My husband (26M) and I are also hoping to meet more people (friends or couples ) to go out with, try new places, and enjoy the city.

But to be honest… I’m really tired of endless chatting that goes nowhere, or people who flake all the time. I’m looking for genuine, present, kind people who are also willing to invest in a real friendship something consistent and long-term. If you’re looking for that too, I’d love to connect.

Now I don’t really care if you are a scientist or just a regular person making sustainable choices I just want to say from the bottom of my heart that I am forever grateful for your existence on this planet. You are THE reason hope exists. 

Everyday I sip my morning coffee in my backyard hearing the birds chirp and (sometimes) seeing the little hedgehog running through the unkempt green yard, I think about the hope you have created and how I can cling to it too.

If you feel exhausted just remember it’s okay to take care for yourself.

You are amazing, never forget that:)",6,1753055392.0,climatechange,2,0.87,False
1m53s7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1m53s7m/do_you_like_parenthood/,Do you like Parenthood?,"Hi there! 10 month old father here. Me and my wife have discussed this on multiple occasions and we reached the conclusion we don't like parenthood, don't get me wrong we love our daughter, but to us those are 2 separate things.

There are people that fully embrace parent life and don't miss the way things were, and there's nothing wrong with that, but that's just not us... We miss the life we had before, we still want to do all those hobbies or simple things we've taken for granted such as going for dinner just the 2 of us.

10 months in, and it's not getting easier, in fact I think it was easier in the beginning, everyday is a constant rush of preparing meals, driving her to day care and back, feeding her at night, putting her to sleep... There's just no time left after that, we got 1h maybe? for ourselves before we go to bed at 11 something pm. We can't get back to our workout routine, or gaming, or going for a simple coffee at night, or even just going outside after 8 pm.

I thought things were supposed to get easier, but they just seem to be getting harder, she throws tantrums, she is getting harder to put to sleep, she always requires attention and doesn't let us do anything around the house unless she is sleeping... There are moments when she is wonderful and we love her, wouldn't trade that for anything, and we don't regret the decision of having her, but sometimes parent life is no fun, and I can't really sugarcoat it. We wanted to give her a sibling, but it's getting harder and harder to imagine going through all this again...

We get help from family, but there's only so much you can ask of them, and that's not enough for basic day to day stuff, there have been times where she spent the day with the grandparents so we could properly clean the house, not even doing anything fun, which is  depressing.

So yeah it's been a long day, I'm tired and I needed to vent sorry, does anyone else feel the same?",4,1753055171.0,NewParents,6,0.83,False

Accidentally glued your fingers to a circuit board (and called it a “permanent connection test”)? Welcome to r/ElectronicsWhimsyInfo, where the real fun isn’t in flawless projects—it’s in the sparkly, chaotic journey of messing with electronics at home.This isn’t a space for engineering PhDs (though if you’ve got a *genius* trick to stop jumper wires from tangling? Spill it). It’s for the person who cried over a shorted LED… then laughed and turned it into a “vintage flicker effect.” The hobbyist who melted a plastic case with a hot soldering iron but labeled it “custom ventilation.” The brave soul who tried building a robot and ended up with a machine that only spins in circles (but looks *really* determined doing it).Share your tech triumphs (and facepalms): “Finally got my Arduino to blink in Morse code! Burned through 5 resistors, but my dog barked at the pattern—success!” Ask for help with the head-scratchers: “Why does my 3D printer keep making spaghetti? I leveled the bed! Is it secretly a pasta machine?” Celebrate the small wins: “Soldered two wires without burning the table! Cue the victory dance (and maybe a quick check for singed carpet).”We get it. Electronics projects are equal parts frustration and fascination. Like when you spent a weekend coding a smart lamp, only to have it turn on at 3 a.m. for no reason. Or when you tried to build a Bluetooth speaker and ended up with a device that plays static… *loudly*. But those are the stories that make your workbench yours—scorched soldering mats, mismatched screwdrivers, and all.Grab your multimeter (and maybe a fire extinguisher, just in case). Let’s swap tales about the time you reversed the polarity or mistook a capacitor for a resistor. Here, the more relatable the mishap, the more we cheer. Because in the end, it’s not about the finished gadget—it’s about the curiosity (and the coffee-fueled late nights) that goes into making it.",1,1753055101.0,ElectronicsWhimsyInfo,0,1.0,False
1m53qcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCL/comments/1m53qcu/just_got_back_from_bliss_to_alaska_my/,Just got back from Bliss to Alaska - My thoughts/recommendations,"Just got back from the Bliss where I was with some of our family (3 other groups). Here are some of my thoughts:

\- Overall, staff was extremely courteous, friendly and professional.

\- We were on floor 13 - this worked out well due to its proximity to the observation lounge, pool., and go-carts for the kids. Wife and I had a balcony room and kids had an interior room right across. It was no problem to get extra keys for both rooms from Guest Services.

\- Only went to Garden Cafe (buffet) a few times, but was packed and seating felt cramped. Breakfast was just okay and dinner was better (good Indian food). Best spot was to go outside near pool where you get fresh air, it's covered and there are heaters so it was comfortable.

\- I'm 6'3"" and the beds appear to be two twins put together so my feet hung off the end. Likely this contributed to not-so-great sleep for me.

\- My wife and I shared the unlimited streaming wifi. It worked well to just log off one device for the other. However, the overall quality of the wifi wasn't that great.

\- My father and stepmother were staying in the Haven. They were able to get us up there a few times. They also had all of us eat with them in the restaurant (for an added fee to them).  We also were able to get priority disembarking with them for no additional fee.

\- Complimentary restaurants were good and we hit Taste, Savor and The Manhattan Room several times. Cagney's was definitely the best meal and we also hit La Cucina and Food Republic. La Cucina was pretty good and Food Republic had very good food but the tabletop digital ordering system took longer to explain than if they just took our order, especially with a table of 12 of us. Screens near elevators were helpful to see how busy restaurants were.

\- Piano player at District Brew House was fun after 9:30 PM.

\- Something hidden is the mini-bowling near in The Local which was a fun thing to mix stuff up with.

\- My wife got the Priority Pass before really researching it. It was not needed and especially not when I could piggyback some of the Haven benefits.

\- Breakfast room service worked out well the morning of an early excursion and the last day before disembarking. One of the benefits of the Priority Pass was it waived the room service fee.

\- Based on comments here, went to Guest Services early and requested coffee maker and robes which were promptly brought to room.

\- Another suggestion here was ordering magnetic hooks from Amazon which worked well and ceiling was magnetic too so hung small BT speaker from there.

\- Went to gym a few times. Very quiet at embarkation and then started filling up. Also relatively quiet late afternoon/early evening.

\- Did the behind-the-scenes tour. It was a tad pricey ($139pp) but very interesting. They take you to the kitchens, laundry, engineering room and bridge as well as other places you wouldn't normally see. If you're interested in how things are done, I would recommend it.",15,1753055035.0,NCL,9,0.94,False

1m53phn,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1m53phn/f19_looking_for_something_soft_and_storydriven/,[F19] looking for something soft and story-driven,"hi :) i’ve been in the mood to write again, and i’d really love to find someone who’s into slow, character-focused storytelling. nothing fast-paced or overly dramatic. just something soft and a little emotional. maybe it’s modern day, maybe it’s a little whimsical, but the heart of it is just two people figuring each other out.

i’m really into slice of life stories with a romantic thread woven in. not insta-love or anything overly cheesy, just something that builds naturally over time. maybe we meet every sunday at the same coffee shop without talking for months, or maybe we’re roommates in college who slowly learn to trust each other. i’m also into quiet childhood friends stories, or strangers who feel oddly familiar. anything where the connection takes time and feels earned.

i like to write in third person, past tense. usually around 2–4 paragraphs per reply, depending on the flow. i don’t care too much about length, as long as there’s effort and some emotional depth. not into one-liners or rushed scenes. i’m okay with replies being slower too, especially if we’re building something meaningful. quality over speed.

i tend to write soft, slightly shy characters who overthink things and struggle with vulnerability. they don’t always say the right thing, but they care deeply. i’d love to write with someone who enjoys exploring that kind of emotional space too. little things like shared silence, nervous confessions, or a character fixing the other’s coat on a cold day. stuff that feels small but matters a lot.

if that sounds like something you’d enjoy, i’d love to talk and maybe brainstorm a world together. no pressure or expectations, just good energy and mutual care for the story.

thank you for reading. i hope today has been kind to you.

CHAPTER ONE

Nia – Friday Night, Late October

The new neighbors arrived in the middle of the night.

Not the poetic kind of arrival—no soft headlights or murmured apologies. This was bright floodlights, slamming van doors, and two men arguing in what sounded like surround sound. She sat up in bed before she was fully awake, blinking toward the window as Zoey gave a low, annoyed bark from the foot of the bed.

“What the hell…” she mumbled, already swinging her legs over the side.

Her boyfriend, half-asleep, muttered something unintelligible into his pillow.

Out the bedroom window, the glow of the U-Haul lit up their shared driveway like a stage. Four people were unloading furniture with the kind of intensity reserved for last-minute movers or people who didn’t care how much noise they made. The low scrape of something heavy across pavement hit her chest like a car alarm.

“Seriously?” she hissed.

She padded barefoot to the living room and flicked on the porch light, just in case the cue was missed.

It wasn’t.

A tall man in a navy hoodie glanced up, pausing mid-step with what looked like a dining chair held over one shoulder. Their eyes met—just for a second—and Nia did what she always did when caught watching something she wasn’t supposed to: she raised her eyebrows like she was surprised he was there.

Her boyfriend came down the hall then, tugging on a hoodie. “Want me to say something?”

“Let’s both go,” she said, wrapping her cardigan tight and slipping on the clogs by the door.

They stepped outside into the cold, where the night smelled like damp concrete and stress.

“Hey,” Nia called, loud enough to be heard but not aggressive. “It’s almost one a.m.… Is this really happening now?”

One of the men—maybe the brother—stopped moving a rolled carpet and looked at her sheepishly. The tall one—hoodie, chair guy—set the chair down and walked over.

“Sorry,” he said, his accent light but noticeable. “The truck rental was delayed, and we couldn’t wait.”

“Couldn’t you at least keep it down?” her boyfriend added. “Some of us work in the morning.”

“Yeah, of course,” the man said, already nodding. “We’ll try to finish fast.”

He sounded sincere. Not irritated. Just tired.

Nia held his gaze for a second longer than she needed to. He had kind eyes, she noticed—annoyingly kind for someone who had woken her up with an armoire.

“Thanks,” she said, softer this time. “We’ve just had… a few chaotic neighbors.”

He nodded again, then turned and relayed something in another language—Gujarati, maybe—to the rest of the group. Their pace slowed.

She and her boyfriend went back inside. Zoey had already curled back up on the bed like nothing had happened. Typical.

As she settled under the covers again, Nia stared at the ceiling.

There was something about them. She wasn’t sure what yet—but something told her this move-in would matter in ways she couldn’t name.

By Saturday night, she was convinced they had moved in and vanished.

No footsteps. No furniture assembly. No kitchen clatter through the wall. Not even the thump of someone running up the stairs too fast.

Just silence.

It made her suspicious.

She didn’t like surprises when it came to neighbors. Last time, the surprise had been a drum kit and a poorly trained German Shepherd. Before that, someone who hotboxed the shed with the same playlist on loop every Friday.

She went about her day, half-expecting to hear something—an argument, a vacuum, a blender, anything. Instead, it was just Zoey’s paws clicking on the floor and the occasional gust of wind rattling the partition fence she had paid for herself. She made dinner, read a chapter of something she’d started three times already, and lit a candle with a scent called evening fig. By 9 p.m., the house felt too still.

She even stood in the hallway at one point, just listening.

Nothing.

“Maybe they’re ghosts,” she muttered.

Zoey didn’t even lift her head.

⸻

On Sunday afternoon, she gave in.

She wasn’t going to let a single bad start set the tone. It wasn’t her style. Plus, curiosity had been eating at her all weekend.

She made a coffee, took it to go in a travel mug, and walked the long way around the front, pausing for a second on the lawn as if that would make it less awkward.

The front door was open, screen shut. She knocked once—just enough to be heard. She could see someone’s shadow move inside before the door opened.

It was him—the tall one from the night before. Hoodie replaced by a plain dark tee. There was a slight smell of masala or cumin behind him, something warm and bright.

“Hi,” she said, shifting her weight. “I just—wanted to say sorry for the other night. We were kind of abrupt. It was late, and I guess we were cranky.”

He blinked, then smiled slightly. “No problem. We were loud.”

“You were moving. It happens,” she said. “I just wanted to say welcome, properly.”

“Thanks.” He opened the door a bit wider but didn’t step out.

“I’m Nia, by the way. We live on the other side. With the very barky dog.”

His smile warmed. “Scotch barked back this morning. So, fair.”

“Scotch?” she asked.

“Our dog. Husky mix. White and brown. Just turned four.”

“Same age as Zoey. They should meet sometime.”

“Sure,” he said. “Once we’re settled.”

There was a pause. The kind that’s hard to end without a script.

“Anyway,” she said, stepping back, “just wanted to say hi.”

He nodded. “Raj.”

She smiled. “Nice to meet you, Raj.”

She turned, half-expecting Zoey to be watching from the window like a jealous sibling.



CHAPTER TWO

Shared POV – Thursday, October 31st – Diwali & Halloween

The neighborhood smelled like burnt sugar and wet leaves.

It was the kind of fall evening that settled fast—sky smudged grey, air thin and cold, every porch lit up with paper skeletons or dollar-store cobwebs. On Nia’s side of the duplex, the jack-o’-lantern flickered gently, half-smiling into the dark. The bowl of candy was already half empty by six-thirty, and she wasn’t sure if that meant they were doing well or if kids were just greedy this year.

Her boyfriend was on the steps, hoodie up, handing out bars with the enthusiasm of someone pretending to like children. Nia watched from the door, sipping wine and laughing every time he guessed a costume wrong.

Across the lawn, the other side of the duplex glowed gold.

No Halloween decorations. No porch lights.

Instead, there were candles—small, flickering diyas—lined up neatly along the walkway. Orange marigolds in metal bowls. The smell of ghee, cardamom, something fried and fragrant that drifted over with the breeze.

It was the kind of warmth that didn’t ask to be noticed, but couldn’t be ignored.

Through the fence slats, Nia caught flashes of movement: people gathered in the backyard, maybe a dozen or more. Voices rising, laughing, then fading again. Not wild—just full.

There was music, too. Not loud. Just enough to reach her through the walls—a rhythmic beat, something bright and pulsing, threaded with voices she couldn’t understand but felt anyway.

She closed her eyes for a moment and let it wash over her.

⸻

Raj stood near the fire pit, hands in his pockets, watching his cousin attempt to light another diya without burning off his eyebrows. The backyard was crowded—extended family from Bedford and Dartmouth had come, bringing food and noise and stories. His sister had cooked for two days straight. His brother had hung string lights at 2 a.m. because “Diwali is still Diwali, even if the neighbors sleep at nine.”

No one seemed to mind the space. No one complained.

For a moment, Raj forgot where he was.

Then he looked toward the other side of the fence.

Their half of the yard was dark. Porch light on, jack-o’-lantern grinning, soft porch voices. He saw her silhouette—Nia—on the doorstep, glass in hand. Laughing at something her partner said. At peace.

He wondered if she could hear the music. If she recognized the beat. If she resented the sound or secretly leaned into it.

There was no way to know.

But when their eyes met—across flame and fence, porch and shadow—it lasted just long enough to register.

Not a greeting.

Not a moment.

Just… recognition.

⸻

Later, long after the candy had run out and the fire had burned low, Nia lay in bed and smelled spices in the air vents. She thought of the warmth on the other side of the wall. The laughter. The music.

It wasn’t envy exactly. More like… a memory.

She drifted off thinking of a courtyard in Ahmedabad, long ago. Gold light. Cracked tiles. Bells in the distance.

The front step had grown cold beneath Nia’s legs, but she stayed until the last round of trick-or-treaters passed.

“Pretty sure that was the same kid twice,” her boyfriend said, chewing on a mini Snickers.

Nia smirked. “Bold of you to assume I care.”

They shut the porch light off around eight and went inside, candy bowl now mostly wrappers. Zoey was at a kennel overnight—the first time in months. Nia hated the silence it left behind, the way it made the house echo. So, they drowned it out.

A Treehouse of Horror marathon was already queued up, and Nia curled into the couch with a throw blanket and a glass of cheap red. They knew every line—Homer in space, Bart’s evil twin—but it didn’t matter. It was tradition. Silly, predictable, steady.

Around them, the house throbbed faintly with distant sound. A bass beat through the floor. Voices rising from the other side of the wall. Not intrusive—just… present.

She muted the TV during commercials and listened.

⸻

On the other side of the wall, Raj led his uncle through the kitchen, Scotch trailing behind them, tail wagging like he’d been raised in this house all along.

“Basement?” his uncle asked.

Raj nodded. “Yeah, come see.”

He opened the door, flicked on the light, and winced slightly. The basement was half-finished—low ceilings, cool concrete, a soft echo that bounced off every step. The stairs creaked, and he made a mental note to oil them. Again.

“Not soundproof,” he admitted.

“Good for storage though,” his uncle said, poking the water heater approvingly.

Upstairs, his sister gave her cousin a tour of the bedrooms. The smallest had already become the prayer room, with marigold-colored cloth pinned above a shelf of framed gods. His cousin laughed at the house’s narrow hallway. “Classic Nova Scotia,” she said. “Everything’s just a bit too close.”

Raj liked it.

The upstairs windows looked out over the backyard—bigger than they’d expected, wide enough for Scotch to stretch his legs and for spring gardens to take shape. He imagined a lawn chair out there. A grill. Morning tea with sunlight cutting through the fence slats.

He heard someone laugh on the other side. A woman’s voice—brief, then muffled.

He wondered if she thought the same thing about the backyard. If she’d ever admit it.

⸻

By the time midnight crept in, both houses had settled.

Nia had dozed off for the end of Season 12. Her boyfriend was snoring lightly, TV still glowing. The wine glass on the coffee table was half full, the flame of her lavender candle just a stub.

Raj stood at the back door, watching the last of the diyas flicker out.

Scotch pressed his head against Raj’s leg, sleepy and full. Someone had given him too much paneer.

The house was warm now. Lived-in. Real.

And though Raj didn’t know it, on the other side of the wall, Nia was dreaming of yellow light and a fire she couldn’t see.

CHAPTER THREE

Raj – Early November

The house felt different now that everyone was gone.

The weekend had been loud—clinking metal bowls, tangled shoes at the door, cousins yelling across staircases, the sharp burn of clove oil in the air. Even Scotch had been overstimulated, spinning in circles through legs and open doors.

But now, on Monday evening, it was quiet. Raj stood in the kitchen, waiting for the rice cooker to click. His sister was upstairs on a call. His cousin had gone to the gym. His brother was already in bed with a podcast playing low.

The house held its breath.

Raj opened the back door to let the air out. Halifax smelled different after dark. Damp leaves, maybe. A hint of salt from the harbor, even this far up. He stepped outside barefoot, Scotch trotting out beside him.

The backyard felt huge in the dark.

Bigger than it had during the family tour. The string lights still hung across the fence from Diwali. A few had already gone out. He made a note to take them down. Maybe on the weekend.

Next door, her porch light was still on.

He could see her shape through the window—just a flicker. She moved like someone who wasn’t trying to be noticed but also wasn’t hiding. He didn’t know her name yet, but she was the one who’d come to the door on Sunday.

Nia. That was it. She’d introduced herself. Offered to let the dogs meet.

Once we’re settled, he had said.

He didn’t mean to lie. He just wasn’t ready.

⸻

On Tuesday morning, he heard music through the wall for the first time.

Not loud. Just a thrum of bass and something vaguely electronic—tempo too upbeat for how cold the air felt. He stood in the hallway and listened without realizing it, one sock half-pulled on.

Then the song changed. A softer melody, almost Greek in structure—he couldn’t name it, but it reminded him of his father’s old CDs, the ones they used to listen to in the shop during monsoon season.

He found himself wondering: Did she know what it meant to be far from home?

Then Scotch barked at nothing, and the moment passed.


CHAPTER THREE (continued)

Raj – Early November, Tuesday Morning

The work car wasn’t anything special—just a silver sedan with the city logo on the side and a clipboard wedged forever in the backseat. But it gave him a strange sense of pride, parking it in front of the house.

He parked it neatly that morning, lining it up between the faded curb lines the way his manager had once demonstrated like it was a sacred ritual. One tire too close to the driveway, though—just a little.

Scotch barked once through the front window, then immediately lost interest.

Raj had just locked the door when he heard her.

“Hi—excuse me?”

He turned.

She was standing on her side of the front walk, wearing boots, leggings, a long coat, and a high ponytail that made her look taller than she probably was. Mug in hand, dog-less this time.

“Sorry—just wanted to ask,” she said, pointing toward the work car. “If you could leave a bit more space near the curb when you park, that would be amazing. It’s kind of tight for two vehicles.”

Raj blinked. “Oh. Yeah, of course. Sorry.”

Her smile was polite. Noncommittal. Not unkind. “Thanks. It’s just a weird little corner.”

“No problem,” he said.

She nodded once and turned, already heading up the steps. As she reached the top, she added over her shoulder, “Have a good day.”

“You too,” he said, too quietly for her to hear.

He stood there for another moment, keys in hand.

It wasn’t the comment—it was fine. Reasonable. Normal.

It was the way she’d said it: all soft authority and clipped efficiency, like someone used to saying things exactly once and having them land.

It reminded him of his supervisor.

Or his older sister.

Or the woman at the Service Canada counter who didn’t look up when he’d passed his citizenship interview.

He walked to the car and adjusted it anyway.

Just an extra six inches.

But something about it stayed with him all day.


CHAPTER THREE (continued)

Raj – Tuesday Afternoon & Evening

Work that day was mostly follow-ups.

Overgrown hedges. A resident claiming their neighbor had built a deck too close to the lot line. Someone demanding to know why a shed had to be moved two feet to the left. Raj typed in notes, double-checked file numbers, flagged a complaint for a re-inspection.

He liked the rules. There was clarity in them. Permits either existed or they didn’t. Fences were either regulation height or not. It wasn’t personal.

He printed a compliance notice for a case he’d been following since July—fencing installed without a permit, six inches too high. Just like his supervisor said: “Half a foot can cause a lot of noise.”

He smirked at that.

Still, something about the morning’s exchange stuck in his ribs. Nia’s voice. The way she said “that would be amazing” like it was just short of “please don’t make me say this again.”

⸻

That evening, the house was calm again. His sister cooked while humming something in Gujarati. The pressure cooker hissed in the kitchen. His cousin was watching a game in the living room.

Raj stood near the front window, adjusting the curtain just enough to look out.

Her car was back. The same compact grey one with the reusable grocery bags still visible in the back seat. The porch light was off, but a warm yellow glowed in the front window.

Then came the bark.

Short. Sharp. Then two more in quick succession.

Zoey.

He didn’t know the dog well yet, but he could tell—it barked at everything. Leaves. Squirrels. Passing ghosts. Scotch barked back sometimes, more out of obligation than enthusiasm.

Still, the sound surprised him.

Not because it was loud. But because he liked knowing she was home.

He turned away from the window, annoyed at himself for even thinking that.

He wasn’t here to pay attention to his neighbor.

He was here to build a life.",1,1753054046.0,creativewriting,1,1.0,False

I’m not sure if he ensured the dual oven outlet was suitable for two ovens and a hob? And now we are also considering adding a 3rd microwave oven and a coffee maker to the design in a 2x2 appliance layout like the image from magnet ad attached.

My question is:  looking at the snapshot of the electric certificate attached, is the third circuit on there, sufficient for two ovens and a 4 ring ceramic hob (yet to be purchased) to be installed?

If so… could be even do 3 ovens and coffee maker? Or would that need a 4th circuit installing in from breaker board?

I have also attached two screenshots from
The Samsung website, of spec of one of Smart steamer ovens we already bought, and are yet to buy 1 or 2 more of depending on answers.

Not got spec for hob as yet to be bought. But will just be a black ceramic glass hob with standard touchscreen buttons.

I’m planning a trip to the Yukon and Alaska and am really excited to explore some *beginner* survival/bushcrafting schools. I’ve done some research, but I’d love to hear from locals and experienced adventurers here. I’m a Los Angeleno (not exactly a wilderness expert), and I’m looking for advice on the best *beginner* survival schools in the area, especially ones that focus on hands-on, immersive experiences.

Additionally, what should I know beyond what’s listed on these schools’ websites? Any tips on what to expect when dealing with the environment, gear, or general survival practices in Yukon?

Also, as a first-time visitor, are there any local expectations that tourists like me should be aware of? I’d love to learn more about the culture and the kind of conversations that locals appreciate.

Lastly, if I’m in towns like Whitehorse (Yukon) or Fairbanks (Alaska), any coffee shops, museums, or places to check out that will most likely be open year-round? Looking forward to hearing your recommendations!",2,1753053739.0,Yukon,2,1.0,False
1m5379n,https://www.reddit.com/r/sydneyadamssnark1/comments/1m5379n/rant/,Rant,"She’s not healthy. Her eating is disordered. for all of the “working out” she does, she is constantly being humbled by 10lb dumbbells on her first set. 

I sometimes wonder if Sydney actually hates the people who have watched her content from the beginning because we realize how much she contradicts herself and lies and isn’t this perfect image of health and spreads misinformation all for profit. Most importantly, WE KNOW WHAT YOU USED TO LOOK LIKE. WE KNOW YOU ARE GETTING WORK DONE. no if ands or buts. No doubt about it, sister. 


Her quads have always been large bc of her genetics which she has talked about various times over the years and before she lost all that weight, she used to be self conscious about them. Shes constantly identifying with new food allergies or even going as far as claiming she has chronic autoimmune diseases as if they’re trends , just to back pedal on them a month later only after someone in the comments says “hey I thought you were allergic to this” 

She doesn’t get herself fixed because she thinks she looks good bc she lacks any self awareness and has severe body dysmorphia. She whole heartedly wishes she was someone else and spends all her money, energy and time in trying to do so. You can see this with her constantly adding more filler more Botox etc and lying about it. Lying about her veneers. And not only does she lie but she genuinely gets angry when people bring it up in her comments because it goes against her own delusions and lies she has to tell herself daily. 

Constantly buying SO SO SO much stuff. This girl has purchased every “trending” material item that has crossed every timeline I have, and how often do we see her use these things? And then has the audacity to KEEP MAKING HAUL VIDEOS. A 20 minute YT video of just shit you bought because the girl you wish you looked like bought. And we are all guilty of seeing something and buying it but ever. Single. Item. She buys is copied and pasted. She has no creativity and hasn’t had an original thought in years. Like the gap bags, the hair clips, the gap clothes, the sour dough jars, the golden retriever, the cabinets, the journals, the books, the Apple Watch, the air pod maxes, the air pods, the garmin, the oura ring, the skin scare products, the shoes. The coffee obsession. The ground beef and cottage cheese bowls. Makayla gets her boobs done, now she includes several clips of her own itties with her face cropped out. She doesn’t listen to music historically but because people have made videos about how much they love music she includes a 1:30 clip in her video saying how much she all of sudden loves music and can’t workout without it. The dresses that don’t fit her body type. Everything. She buys and does all this stuff because she likes how the aesthetic looks on other people and then she realizes it doesn’t fit her or she’s boring and doesn’t know how to cope outside of beige and black clothes and missionary sex and moves onto another trend. It’s pathological at this point. 

She just bought everything new in her kitchen and the girl has admitted multiple times over the last 5 years that she can’t cook and doesn’t like to cook. Every time she tries a recipe from Tik tok it never turns out, even very simple ones. Yet, she HAD to buy all brand new things to fill that boring ass kitchen. 

And someone riddle me this: if you have a model home and you spend 100k on an upgrade why is the actual hell did it come out looking exactly like a luxury MODEL HOME??

The therapy ad on her YT was a joke. If she went to therapy lord knows, we would hear about it. The same way we hear about her constantly going to paint pottery. The same way every single time she does something nice for someone she has to pull her camera out and post it for validation. She doesn’t have any type of discipline and she’s impulsive and instead of just admitting something isn’t for her or she doesn’t enjoy doing something as much as she thought she would, she continues to lie and put on a facade until something new comes along that she feels will distract her audience enough they won’t notice. Ex. Her “bible study” and the book she’s been reading for 4 months. And honestly, im a reader and I know sometimes you pick up a book and it ends up being a slow burn or just not what you like, that’s fine. I think the core principle in Sydneys case is that she continues to post the damn book and EVEN records herself pretending to read the book. Just say you don’t like the book. Stop lying. We can tell by the way you form a sentence you are not super intelligent, that is okay. Sometimes I just want to be like you”Sydney, you’re the one holding the gun to your head, no one cares if you read that book or read at all. Lying is not making you or your aesthetic anymore appealing” 

Sydney is constantly trying to project this image of perfect health, life, happiness, and balance and it is simply not the reality that she is living. Yet, she won’t go to medical doctors for her basic appointments. She won’t get the actual testing required by the board of medicine to receive any actual diagnosis and gets very defensive when people comment and try to ask her about her diagnosis or her symptoms etc. 

But you know what she has no problem doing? Promoting Using a pop up lab to get blood work done in which she personally receives the results and then googles them. This is harmful to the people she is promoting this service to  because it’s not covered by insurance, she wants you to use her code so she can profit off of it (exploitation) and because blood work needs to be read by a medical doctor and it is used to diagnose while also looking at clinical symptoms and your overall health. I’m sure anyone reading this who has been through a diagnosis of literally any kind would confirm, it’s not as simple as getting a blood test, plugging it into google and then doing what ChatGPT says to do. She acts like medical doctors don’t go to school, residency and fellowship for 10 years not including 4 years of undergrad. It’s insulting, honestly. Especially when she, herself, can’t even become a real personal trainer and instead takes a 25 question $25 online class and says she’s certified and again, has to post that she got an A on it. Haha 

What’s crazy is if you actually take the time to watch her content (terrible I know) she doesn’t share any relevant,  let alone, science backed information regarding nutrition or even fitness not to mention, her form is consistently incorrect and you can see in her videos she is unbalanced and struggling, and it’s not from failure, it’s because she doesn’t know how to lift but she will not shut the fuck up about  being a certified personal trainer. Yet, on her “programs” she is regulating people’s diets and macronutrients as if she has any education or authority what so ever to do so. My best friend is a personal trainer, retired body builder, majored in kinesiology and sports science with a minor in nutrition and this man is prepared to answer any of his clients questions and educate them on a variety of topics from body mechanics, science behind progressive overload, the science behind how  supplements are going to affect your body, the physiology during hypertrophy, etc. and none of his “programs” are online either lmao 

she very clearly suffers from true obsessive disorder and cannot function let alone enjoy anything outside of her control, from not being willing to do anything that her husband enjoys doing, all the down to her diet. 

Shes also just not fun and every time she tries to be fun you can tell it’s forced and especially if she’s with other girls, she’s mimicking what she thinks “being fun” or “being silly” looks like and it just makes her look awkward. Every interaction that you see with her on camera appears to show her masking. If you listen to her conversations, especially with her other influencers “friends”, you can tell she doesn’t know what to talk about and brings up “trending” subjects and her responses are very vague and are always accompanied by that over enthusiastic, creepy smile. (pHD student and love over analyzing human behavior lmao) 


She may be skinny and have visible muscles but she is malnourished. Any educated person would know that there is no benefit of being in a deficit for longer than 8-12 weeks and the deficit becomes redundant.  if you already have low body fat percentage, as Sydney does, that time range becomes shorter. And you don’t need to say youre in “maintenance” if you’re just living at your recommended daily macros lmao unless you’re actually competing or you’re a real life athlete but mind you, my ex partner plays in the NBA, none of them speak like this or use these terms. It’s a little weird hearing gym girlies who are training for nothing say these kind of things but that’s my opinion and it’s neither here nor there lol 

anyway her daily practices are harmful to herself and to every other young, impressionable girl who watches her content and truly believes it’s the norm. 

I know she wishes she could live in a bubble where only the 14yr old girls who think she’s doing something and the bots she pays to give the most unrealistic engagement we’ve all ever seen exist. She doesn’t even care to delete the chatGPT prompt before posting comments calling herself “naturally stunning” on her own posts lmao. Like girl, don’t buy another unflattering dress, get help instead. 


I seriously hope that she gets in trouble one day because she’s a fraud.

He wouldn’t say where he was from; however, he just mumbled “Not from around here” under his breath. Burt decided to focus his attention on him first, before he was slated to stand trial in front of the town “court”.

“Just for the record, can you tell me your name once again and where you’re from?” Burt asked, sitting down in front of the jail cell with a pen and paper.

“I already told you… My name is Joseph Carter, and it ain’t your business where I’m from, you wouldn’t know where it was even if I told you.” Joseph growled at him from under his messy, unkempt, dirty blonde hair, head lowered, looking down. “It don’t matter what I tell you, you still ain’t gonna let me go.”

“I’m not.” Burt agreed solemnly, “You still have to answer before the people of this town for what you did. For endangering their safety.”

“Yeah…” Joseph chuckled dryly, painfully. “And they're gonna kill me for it, you’re gonna kill me for it, so why bother.” Burt thought his words over carefully before continuing.

“There is another matter. Right now, we've just got you on attempted burglary and trespassing charges, but we’ve also got something else going on. Murder. If you’re not going to talk, then at least give me one good reason not to just pin it on you.” Burt spoke, putting his gambit into play. He could see a wave of fear briefly reflected in Joseph’s eyes, but his calm, deathly cocky demeanor soon returned.

“You ain’t gonna do that. I know the likes of you, cop,” he said. “Y’all got a serious hard-on for law and order, for appearances. I ain’t killed nobody, but hell, what’s my word mean to you anyway? Besides, whatcha gonna do when a few days, a week after you do me in, the killings start up again? Who you gon’ blame then?”

“Well, that all depends…” Burt said, prodding forward despite the prisoner’s rebuttal, “That’s only true if you really are innocent. What were you doing and where were you two days ago?”

“I was in the woods, in my tent, starving,” Joseph replied. “How you gonna corroborate that alibi?”

“And where is your camp?” Burt retorted, answering Joseph’s question with one of his own.

“In the foothills on the west side of town, right behind the abandoned house with the big ole bus parked outside. You know where that is?” Joseph replied with a surprising level of detail. “You gonna walk out there and see what I’ve been up to?”

“Yes on both accounts.” Burt nodded, getting up to leave. He knew that house quite well as he had passed by it frequently.

“How you know I don’t have a few buddies of mine there lying in wait there, ready to blast your thin blue line ass?” Joseph smiled sickly, his yellow-stained teeth on full display.

“In that case, I doubt you would have told me.” Burt fired back, but inwardly admitted that he didn’t know, and that he had no way of knowing until it was too late. Still, a job was a job. He got into the patrol car and headed off down the road.

He was headed off to the outskirts of the town, where the houses grew rarer and more sparse, and where rusted through old muscle cars, the pinnacle of Detroit engineering from a different age that just hovered on the brink of living memory, lay discarded as if some giant child had left his Hotwheels laying around and then never came back for them.

In the hills, the rusting spires of former coal mines loomed high like the steeples of abandoned cathedrals, waiting, longing, yearning to see once more their congregations return and to hear the hymns of picks and drills, extracting the black anthracite ichor of the land.

After some time, he finally arrived at his destination, the remains of a nice house, with its roof now partially caved in and its windows long since broken, with dead weeds and vines still clinging to the peeling away siding. In the driveway stood a bus, the same type used by schools and prisons, but this one seemed to be repainted gray at some point by hand. Perhaps at some point, the original inhabitants of the house wanted to remake it into a camper van. Whatever their intentions may have been, the hulking elephant-like beast would certainly never move again, with all of its tires flat. He parked the Ford Explorer beside it and carefully stepped out, peering out into the treeline just beyond the house.

By now, the sun had already begun to set, lighting up the sky in a wistful shade of reddish-yellow and casting long, deep shadows behind each tree. He drew his revolver and, holding it at the ready, advanced slowly, step after step, over the thick layer of snow carpeting the overgrown lawn. Moving around the side of the house, he fairly quickly spotted a small trail running through the woods, with footprints leading in and out several times, indicating that either Joseph or his potential accomplices had indeed been there recently.

Step after step. The snow crunched with each movement. The birds didn’t sing, and even the wind had stopped blowing. Everything was dead silent. Everything, the trees, the birds, the rocks, and whoever else was lurking in that small clearing he could see just up ahead were all waiting for him, watching his every step. Crunch. He tightened his grip on the gun, his finger gingerly resting on the trigger.

The clearing was empty save for a cheap, generic camping tent, partially camouflaged by a tarp hung loosely to one side. It was tattered by the elements, the flimsy aluminum poles bent under the weight of the snow overtop. The remains of a campfire could be seen close by, with the snow melted in a small radius around it. In the middle, remnants of some sort of carcass could be seen. All about, the snow was marked with countless footprints, maybe one person’s, maybe several. Cautiously, Burt approached, his gaze and attention torn between the bloody mess near the fire pit and scanning the treeline. His heart was beating so loudly in his chest, he could scarcely distinguish between his own heartbeat and the sound of crunching snow under someone else’s feet. He was scared not just of a hostile encounter but of the thought of any encounter, out here.

It was clearly the remains of a large animal, picked entirely clean, the cracked and broken ribs and spine being the only recognizable parts left. He hoped it was a deer. Cautiously, he stepped towards the tent. The front door was zipped shut, concealing whatever or potentially whoever still lay inside.

“Police!” he exclaimed, his voice sounding shaky and unconvincing. “If anyone is in there, identify yourselves and come out slowly, with your hands above your head!”

It was just a formality, after all, if anyone was there, they would have almost certainly heard him clumsily stomping through the snow a mile away, and would have had countless moments to shoot or attack him already if they so wanted to. At this reassuring thought, he relaxed slightly, but not enough to lower the barrel of his gun.

Peaking through the semi-transparent canopy of the tent, he could see a mess of various equipment scattered about inside, but thankfully, no people. Zipping open the door, he crouched down and took a closer look inside. A chill ran up his spine.

There were two sets of sleeping bags, two moldy and dirty inflatable mattresses, and two backpacks, but only one winter coat and only one set of boots.

He immediately stood up and spun around, swivelling his gun at the treeline, his mind reeling with the possible explanations as his body acted on pure instinct and reflexes. Now more than ever, the woods seemed so alien and hostile, the trees all watching him, and it seemed like momentarily, should he turn his back in any one direction, the trees there would begin to immediately inch their way forward towards him from behind, closing the loop tighter and tighter around him, suffocating him.

It was then that he looked again at the carcass lying on the now blackened charcoal and ash of the fire. Although, of course, he would have to have it tested and examined, he already knew in his heart of hearts that it was no deer.

He had radioed in to Kody for help, who was thankfully not busy, and together they combed the campsite, bagged up the remains of the unknown John Doe and the belongings from the tent, taking copious Polaroid photographs of everything beforehand.

Back at the station, Burt sat there, his face buried in his own hands, just breathing, in and out, trying to calm his racing heart that was desperately attempting to catch up to his mind, which was going a million miles an hour. Every inhale felt like an eternity, every exhale a slow loss. Again, and again. Why here, why now, why to him? He couldn’t bear to go down and examine the remains, much less face down the monster Joseph Carter to prove what was already obvious. Maybe it was fear, or simply exhaustion, he simply couldn’t bring himself to do it. At least he was already in custody. He didn’t even hear the ticking of the clock, much less Bill’s approaching footsteps.

“Hey man, you look like shit,” Bill said, standing over him and extending him a hand. “You up for a drink?”

“There’s so much to do…” Burt murmured in half-hearted protest.

“And that is what exactly? We did it, we caught the bastard, ain’t much else we can do except catalogue all the evidence and then present it before the judge on Monday. The facts speak for themselves. In the meantime, he isn’t going anywhere.” Bill said with a tone of voice that betrayed just how equally tired he was.

“Alright, I suppose it can’t hurt.” Burt sighed, getting up and putting on his coat. Still, he cast a quick, terrified look at the doors leading to the small jail and the basement, as if he could feel the man that was sitting there secreting and oozing his menace, his evil from in between the bars, letting it pool in the form of some black goo which will flow out and escape or reshape itself into some new horror. He shuddered. Maybe Ada Brady was right after all.

He and Bill made their way down to Dutch’s Bar, a couple of streets over. It was a nice, hole-in-the-wall place, where even though a no-smoking sign hung on the front door, which had been there for quite some time, your nostrils were still assaulted by the smell of smoke as soon as you swung open the doors. The windows were largely occupied by an air conditioner, which just barely chugged along. Along the edges of the ceiling, dimming neon lights cast the place in a colorful, interesting light, illuminating the walls, which were covered in old 80s movie posters, various sports memorabilia, and even a couple of model planes that hung above. The space was populated by several other patrons, most of whom Burt easily recognized as locals. Beer was a cheap and easy source of calories, cheaper than most other food these days, even watered down as it was. Besides, its main function was, of course, to numb the pain, numb the cold, like a pleasurable microdose of hypothermia.

He and Bill made their way over to the bar, each ordering a shot of some simple locally brewed whisky. While they were waiting, they both couldn’t help but overhear a conversation going on loudly beside them, where a few local men were questioning another man, a traveler who had evidently come from down south and was going to continue the trek northwards again tomorrow. Where he was coming from, and where he was going, they didn’t quite catch.

“How are things down south?” Asked one of the locals, “Buck” Richards, a surly, but generally friendly old timer who could’ve passed for a biker Santa Claus. “I gotta cousin out in Chambersburg, was wondering if you passed through there.”

“Yeah, I’m actually three days out of there,” said the stranger, clearing his throat. “They seem to be doing alright, everything is more or less in good shape, there’s just a lot of rumors going around.”

“Like what?” spoke up Guy Jennings, right beside him, a rowdy, frequent visitor to the bar here. “They’re always making bullshit up to cause a stir and to make themselves feel more important. The only thing really going on down there is those fucking Baltimore refugees mucking up the place.”

“I dunno…” the stranger shrugged. “They say there's a group of ‘merry men’ two dozen strong up in Michaux Forest. They launch raids once a week or so, stealing food, cattle, even some of the last working big rigs. I was told they stood up some of the local militia to come out and try to hunt those bastards down, but they just lay low in the woods, and it's impossible to find them in there.” Here, the stranger looked around, making sure he had the audience’s full attention before continuing, but now with a hushed tone. “There are even rumors going around that the Feds are going to try and take back Harrisburg. The locals have been seeing strange lights on and around Blue Ridge Summit. I think they’re finally going to show their faces. Hell, who knows, maybe they already took Waynesboro as we speak.”

“Fuck…” slurred Guy. “I thought those cocksuckers would have all eaten themselves alive in that concrete hole in the ground of theirs by now.”

“With language like that, shouldn’t you be somewhere else?” Bill couldn’t help but interject.

“What’s the matter, pig?” Guy turned, his face red, visibly fuming at the implication. “Did you get offended on behalf of your buddies?” Burt watched his movements carefully, his own hand already resting on the handle of his revolver, but for all his bluster, Guy thankfully knew better than to try some bullshit and kept both his hands above the bar wrapped tightly around his glass.

“I’m just saying, it's an awful lotta talk.” Bill continued with a devilish grin. Guy looked like he wanted to drop something devilish on Bill, a cornucopia of insults of various calibers just on the tip of his tongue, but noticing Burt’s hand on his gun, and old Dutch reaching with one hand under the bar, he decided against it.

“The only good bluebelly is a damn dead one.” Guy finally muttered to himself in a defeated manner, turning back to his drink.

“Did you really have to do that?” Burt asked his friend worriedly once the few tense moments had passed, and a slightly more relaxed atmosphere returned to the bar.

“You know me, I gotta get my kicks in somehow.” Bill offered a very tired smile. “Helps me let off some steam and get my mind off things. Besides, you know I got it way worse from them good old boys when I was growing up. I could almost see it on his face now, him reaching to call me a slur.”

“Not the only thing he was reaching for,” Burt interjected, “And you know it. No more corpses in the basement, god forbid it's you,” he said, and he could feel tears beginning to well up in his eyes, the whiskey already doing its work. Bill sat next to him in silence for a few moments, as Burt struggled not to lose his composure, flashes of all that he had seen the past two days jumping through his mind at lightning speed.

“You can’t let it get to you like that.” Bill finally spoke up, his voice quiet but deadly serious. “That’s what I learned from dealing with types like him my whole life.” He said, gesturing over his back at Guy, who was drunkenly stumbling out the door. “I know you, old buddy, I know how much you love your Norman Rockwell set to the tune of Johnny Cash, but that existed only for a brief few decades because of a very specific set of circumstances. Hell, it wasn’t even for everyone, not quite for folks like me, that's for sure. And yet, here you are, losing your head over the fact that the world’s just going back to the natural state of things.”

“An innocent girl is dead, and here you are, talking about that’s the way things are?” Burt asked, indignantly. “It’s our damn job to stop that from happening, and we failed, Bill, we failed…”

“And I’m telling you that really is the way things are. There’s always been darkness in this world. I know you’re religious, so it's the devil or demons for you, but for others, it could be evil spirits, djinn, or whatever have you. But really, it doesn’t care for your value judgments, it just is. It's old. It's as much a part of nature as the mountains. It's always been there in the minds of men and women, and always will be. Accept that.” Bill slowly philosophized, “And as for our jobs, well, we’re doing them, aren’t we? We caught the bastard, but you can’t bring back the dead, no matter how many tears you spill. We’re here to serve justice, and justice is only based on revenge.” 

The conversation moved on to other topics, and before they knew it, they had finished four shots each, and both were feeling it. Burt signaled to Dutch, who brought them the bill. They split the total, slapping down some of the new-style dollars. Dutch counted the money and gave a thumbs up to signal that it was all clear, leaving them free to go.

They sauntered out of the bar and onto the bridge crossing the little creek, where their paths split, with Burt heading off in one direction and Bill in another. Still, Burt lingered for a moment, looking down and listening to the running, pitch black waters.

“I wish we were young again, Bill.” Burt muttered, “Can’t even say I’m getting old, just feeling more and more tired with every passing day, like I’m carrying too many memories around on my back. I still can’t help but look back towards simpler, better days…”

“It’s all water under the bridge, man. It turned the waterwheel of the mill, it powered the factory, it served as the steam for the trains, but it doesn’t stop. It keeps flowing. It flowed away and took all the best years with it.” Bill replied solemnly, patting his friend across the back. “Get some rest, and then it's back to work again tomorrow…” he said, before turning and walking off into the night.

He didn’t remember how he went home, opened the door, or collapsed on his bed. The only thing he remembered was the kaleidoscope of images that swirled through his dreams like a whirlpool pulling down a ship into the dark, endless abyss. 

He dreamt of a girl he had once known, about their last night together, the summer before she went to college, and he would enlist. He had shamefully carried these memories of her, locked away deep in his subconsciousness, through years of a fruitless marriage, and now they had returned to haunt him. He remembered borrowing his father’s beloved square-body Chevy and taking her out for a date in it. They had gotten dinner, but afterwards had retired to a small, secluded little vista called Cedar Point overlooking the valley. All beneath them, the lights of the city sparkled and glimmered with all the joy and liveliness of a million multicolored Christmas lights, and all above them the stars twinkled with the promises of uncounted possibilities. 

He had laid out a couple of blankets in the truck’s bed, and they had lain there, their arms and legs intertwined around one another. She always wanted to be an astrophysicist, and she had even won a substantial scholarship for it at an out-of-state college. She lay there, beside him, and pointed out to him her favorite constellations and even the minuscule little dot that supposedly was the then-new ISS. He never saw it of course, nor did the actual stars themselves have any real value to him, but he believed her wholeheartedly when she pointed every little detail, because to him, the most important thing was the way her eyes gleamed and burned with the unquenchable fires of life, which burned with dreams of distant worlds and with such a brightness that they could outshine even the grandest supernovas. He remembered the rest of the night, he remembered her touch, her taste on his tongue, but above all, he remembered her warmth, radiating from every inch of her skin, emanating from those mesmerizing eyes, from somewhere even deeper within her soul. He wanted to scream, to yell through the dream then that he was going to go with her, that he didn’t need to be a cop or a soldier, that he was going to go learn some other trade, or do anything else, but that he will be with her, but for some reason it felt like he was choking, that his throat was closing up and he couldn’t utter a single sound.

The alarm clock rang.

“Please…” he finally managed to beg, but now to an empty room. He tried to forget the phantom pain of an old wound he thought had long since scarred over, forget her name, her face, her touch, and above all her warmth and her eyes. She was somewhere far, far away. He could only hope.

It was cold. It was time to go to work.

He got up, got dressed, and ate a breakfast of cold, soggy oats with a cup of muddy water with barely enough caffeine in it to justify the name “coffee”. He had the funeral of an innocent girl to attend.

Willow Street was an interesting place, very near to the center of town, where the houses were stacked as close together as possible without technically still being a single connected structure, each one trying to outshine its neighbors in terms of grandeur and “sophistication”. At least, that might have been the intention when the houses were brand new. By now, they had become quite run down and crumbling, as if the brick exteriors were just barely holding on to another. All it would seemingly take is one big bad wolf to come and blow it all down. Boarded-up windows, or those draped in ancient, dirty curtains, looked down on him as he drove past. The yards weren’t any better than the houses themselves, with dead flowers and long-since-abandoned landscaping projects surrounding faded political signs to the tune of “Love is Love” and “Hate Has No Home Here,” or various campaign posters which stood like the many charred pikes of vanquished armies, the distant reminders of some long-ago, now irrelevant conflict. The cramped little alleyways in between the walls accumulated impassable piles of trash or barely contained the vicious howling and barking of only half-domesticated dogs behind collapsing fencing.

Similarly, the church specified by Mrs. Morrison was easily identifiable, albeit a highly strange building full of contradictions. Architecturally, it seemed as though it couldn’t fully commit either to the brooding Gothic style, which perhaps harkened back far too closely to the rigidness of Catholic cathedrals, nor could it fully embrace the simplicity and blunt modesty of the little chapels erected by Puritan settlers. Even theologically, it confused him, specifically the little Gay and Trans Pride flags put in place beside the door. Not that he was against them or the people who identified with them or would discourage them from the faith, but that he simply couldn’t square his own fire-and-brimstone evangelical upbringing with this relatively newfound acceptance. From the Sunday services which he remembered attending with his parents, the church of that day would most likely call them sinners and Sodomites, condemning gay people to eternal suffering, much less openly celebrate them and invite them. 

After all, what could explain such a change? It isn’t as if some radical new information was uncovered; it was still the same old scripture, so why such a change? He didn’t want to think too deeply about it; he had done so once before in his life, and it only brought him turmoil and uncertainty. It was best to simply embrace the faith and let the word and compassion of the Lord guide him.

He parked the patrol car and stepped out. The days-old snow had now become a mushy gray sludge under his feet. He checked the scratched and scuffed face of his watch. The ceremony would begin shortly.

Swinging open one of the creaky doors and passing through the vestibule, he entered the nave, whose walls were painted a nauseous shade of greenish-beige. The coffin was already there, lying beside the altar, and many of the attendees were already there as well. It was a handful of the locals from around the block and those who knew the Morrisons personally. He recognized some of the faces, but he wished he didn’t. One woman was terribly familiar to him; he recalled he had booked her in one night when she was in high school for spray painting “ACAB” and “Defund the Police” onto the side of the station, done so carelessly that she didn’t even think to cover her face from the cameras. Now, of course, years had passed, and from what he heard, she now had children of her own, and all of a sudden, her demeanor changed. She glared at him from one of the pews as he passed, silently accusing him of not doing enough.

He sat down and slid towards the very end, leaning down and resting his forehead on the wooden back of the pew in front of him. It was noticeably warmer in the church, of course, than it was outside, but still not warm enough to actually feel comfortable or at ease. He closed his eyes for a moment, recollecting himself and his thoughts, and with a deep breath, composed himself for the service.

“We are gathered here today, on this bleak morning, to mourn the tragic loss of Elisa Morrison, a bright and promising young woman who by the actions of darkness had been taken from us before her time. And yet, she passes on now to the heavens, where she shall be in the embrace of our Lord and saviour, and where she also shall be reunited with her father.” The priest, an elderly but thin man, began. “It is in days such as these that I recall the words of Mathew who spoke, ‘Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.”

After the prayer was over, many of Elisa’s relatives and friends went up and made statements, recalling the moments of joy which Elisa had brought into their lives. Even her mother, who had managed to put herself together long enough to deliver a truly heart-rending speech recalling holding her daughter in her arms as a newborn for the first time, before falling to her knees and kissing the polished wood of the coffin, one last time.

He could barely hear most of the words, but he didn’t need to; he simply wept.

As the statements came to an end, it was time for the burial itself, and the pallbearers carefully lifted the coffin and carried it out through the door and towards the graveyard across the street. The procession followed suit, but Burt stayed. 

He had already done his part, paid his respects, and that was not the only reason he was here. He carefully watched all of the faces of the attendees, solemn and grim. Several of Elisa’s friends from school had come, but Julia still remained absent. As the procession exited, aside from himself and the priest, one more figure remained, Hunter Dugan. He rose from the pews where he was sitting closer to the front and approached the priest. The two had a brief interaction, which Burt could not overhear, but he saw the priest nod his head and lead the boy towards a small room in the back of the church.

A few minutes later, Hunter emerged, his eyes red from crying, still audibly sniffling. He quickened his pace and speedwalked out of the door, in a hurry to rejoin the funeral group, in the proccess casting a distrustful momentary glance at Burt. He got up and stepped over to the priest, who looked at him expectantly.

‘What did that young man just say to you?” Burt asked him directly, dropping all pretense.

“I’m afraid I cannot tell you, sir. I have made my vow, and I cannot betray his confession,” the priest responded calmly but sternly. Burt thought the answer over for a minute, weighing his options.

“I understand, and in that case, good day to you, and thank you for the service,” he said.

“I will pray for your success, officer.” the priest gave a slight bow of respect, and Burt nodded in return before walking out of the church.

He drove back over to the station. Tomorrow, there was going to be a “trial” held for Joseph Carter, and he had to make sure all of the evidence was ready to be presented in a clear and coherent manner. There was a small courtroom in the town’s municipal building, and there was a real judge who was going to be overseeing the proceedings and a real jury, although Burt doubted that those assembled would truly be Joseph’s peers. But much of the process and fanfare of the trial would, of course, be much different than the way it was done back in the days of the United States. Joseph would, of course, have no public defender assigned to him, and even if they had found someone, he was certain they would refuse to do so given the nature of the case. The man would have to represent himself for what he did. Lastly, the punishments doled out were different as well. Joseph already knew what was waiting for him. This was frontier justice.

“Hey, if you don’t got anything else going on right now, take your time, talk to the motherfucker, try and get him to confess or at least to talk.” Burt tasked Kody with the dirty work as he walked into the station. Something about the man terrified him, not the man himself physically, but rather the notion of who he was, what he was capable of. He would rather re-examine the bones downstairs rather than waste his time interrogating Joseph for a hypothetical confession he knew the man would never give.

“Yes, sir,” the young officer said, finishing up with some paperwork which he was shuffling around on his desk, and headed off to the jail cell.

Burt descended the stairs and turned on the light. It was just ribs and a spine, nothing else, nothing even left on the bones themselves to actually decay, although the disgusting smell of death still hung in the air. He wondered how long it would take to get it to air out. Based on the size alone, it appeared to be a large adult man. Furthermore, the sternum was absent entirely, potentially broken, and ripped out. There was no way of telling if this injury was what killed him or if this was done posthumously in order to butcher him. 

He couldn’t help but gag at the thought.

There wasn’t anything left that could possibly identify the victim, nothing that could tie these bones to a face and a name. He pored over them in detail, but the only things of note that he saw were the human teeth marks left on the ribs. Whoever the man was, he most likely had come with Joseph himself, as there hadn’t been any missing persons reported from the town, especially none matching these remains. As morbid as it was, the fact calmed Burt just a little bit, and he was ashamed that it did.

After going over the remains and taking measurements and pictures of the bite marks, he began to catalog and examine the rest of the equipment recovered from the camp. Some of it was already bagged and catalogued by Kody, including what was certainly the murder weapon: a bloody hatchet found lying on a nearby stump, although the blood on it wasn’t fresh and had already dried to a brown, rusty layer when they recovered it. He was thus occupied when he had heard a loud, earsplitting boom followed by a scream. Undoubtedly a gunshot.",1,1753053506.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

He wouldn’t say where he was from; however, he just mumbled “Not from around here” under his breath. Burt decided to focus his attention on him first, before he was slated to stand trial in front of the town “court”.

“Just for the record, can you tell me your name once again and where you’re from?” Burt asked, sitting down in front of the jail cell with a pen and paper.

“I already told you… My name is Joseph Carter, and it ain’t your business where I’m from, you wouldn’t know where it was even if I told you.” Joseph growled at him from under his messy, unkempt, dirty blonde hair, head lowered, looking down. “It don’t matter what I tell you, you still ain’t gonna let me go.”

“I’m not.” Burt agreed solemnly, “You still have to answer before the people of this town for what you did. For endangering their safety.”

“Yeah…” Joseph chuckled dryly, painfully. “And they're gonna kill me for it, you’re gonna kill me for it, so why bother.” Burt thought his words over carefully before continuing.

“There is another matter. Right now, we've just got you on attempted burglary and trespassing charges, but we’ve also got something else going on. Murder. If you’re not going to talk, then at least give me one good reason not to just pin it on you.” Burt spoke, putting his gambit into play. He could see a wave of fear briefly reflected in Joseph’s eyes, but his calm, deathly cocky demeanor soon returned.

“You ain’t gonna do that. I know the likes of you, cop,” he said. “Y’all got a serious hard-on for law and order, for appearances. I ain’t killed nobody, but hell, what’s my word mean to you anyway? Besides, whatcha gonna do when a few days, a week after you do me in, the killings start up again? Who you gon’ blame then?”

“Well, that all depends…” Burt said, prodding forward despite the prisoner’s rebuttal, “That’s only true if you really are innocent. What were you doing and where were you two days ago?”

“I was in the woods, in my tent, starving,” Joseph replied. “How you gonna corroborate that alibi?”

“And where is your camp?” Burt retorted, answering Joseph’s question with one of his own.

“In the foothills on the west side of town, right behind the abandoned house with the big ole bus parked outside. You know where that is?” Joseph replied with a surprising level of detail. “You gonna walk out there and see what I’ve been up to?”

“Yes on both accounts.” Burt nodded, getting up to leave. He knew that house quite well as he had passed by it frequently.

“How you know I don’t have a few buddies of mine there lying in wait there, ready to blast your thin blue line ass?” Joseph smiled sickly, his yellow-stained teeth on full display.

“In that case, I doubt you would have told me.” Burt fired back, but inwardly admitted that he didn’t know, and that he had no way of knowing until it was too late. Still, a job was a job. He got into the patrol car and headed off down the road.

He was headed off to the outskirts of the town, where the houses grew rarer and more sparse, and where rusted through old muscle cars, the pinnacle of Detroit engineering from a different age that just hovered on the brink of living memory, lay discarded as if some giant child had left his Hotwheels laying around and then never came back for them.

In the hills, the rusting spires of former coal mines loomed high like the steeples of abandoned cathedrals, waiting, longing, yearning to see once more their congregations return and to hear the hymns of picks and drills, extracting the black anthracite ichor of the land.

After some time, he finally arrived at his destination, the remains of a nice house, with its roof now partially caved in and its windows long since broken, with dead weeds and vines still clinging to the peeling away siding. In the driveway stood a bus, the same type used by schools and prisons, but this one seemed to be repainted gray at some point by hand. Perhaps at some point, the original inhabitants of the house wanted to remake it into a camper van. Whatever their intentions may have been, the hulking elephant-like beast would certainly never move again, with all of its tires flat. He parked the Ford Explorer beside it and carefully stepped out, peering out into the treeline just beyond the house.

By now, the sun had already begun to set, lighting up the sky in a wistful shade of reddish-yellow and casting long, deep shadows behind each tree. He drew his revolver and, holding it at the ready, advanced slowly, step after step, over the thick layer of snow carpeting the overgrown lawn. Moving around the side of the house, he fairly quickly spotted a small trail running through the woods, with footprints leading in and out several times, indicating that either Joseph or his potential accomplices had indeed been there recently.

Step after step. The snow crunched with each movement. The birds didn’t sing, and even the wind had stopped blowing. Everything was dead silent. Everything, the trees, the birds, the rocks, and whoever else was lurking in that small clearing he could see just up ahead were all waiting for him, watching his every step. Crunch. He tightened his grip on the gun, his finger gingerly resting on the trigger.

The clearing was empty save for a cheap, generic camping tent, partially camouflaged by a tarp hung loosely to one side. It was tattered by the elements, the flimsy aluminum poles bent under the weight of the snow overtop. The remains of a campfire could be seen close by, with the snow melted in a small radius around it. In the middle, remnants of some sort of carcass could be seen. All about, the snow was marked with countless footprints, maybe one person’s, maybe several. Cautiously, Burt approached, his gaze and attention torn between the bloody mess near the fire pit and scanning the treeline. His heart was beating so loudly in his chest, he could scarcely distinguish between his own heartbeat and the sound of crunching snow under someone else’s feet. He was scared not just of a hostile encounter but of the thought of any encounter, out here.

It was clearly the remains of a large animal, picked entirely clean, the cracked and broken ribs and spine being the only recognizable parts left. He hoped it was a deer. Cautiously, he stepped towards the tent. The front door was zipped shut, concealing whatever or potentially whoever still lay inside.

“Police!” he exclaimed, his voice sounding shaky and unconvincing. “If anyone is in there, identify yourselves and come out slowly, with your hands above your head!”

It was just a formality, after all, if anyone was there, they would have almost certainly heard him clumsily stomping through the snow a mile away, and would have had countless moments to shoot or attack him already if they so wanted to. At this reassuring thought, he relaxed slightly, but not enough to lower the barrel of his gun.

Peaking through the semi-transparent canopy of the tent, he could see a mess of various equipment scattered about inside, but thankfully, no people. Zipping open the door, he crouched down and took a closer look inside. A chill ran up his spine.

There were two sets of sleeping bags, two moldy and dirty inflatable mattresses, and two backpacks, but only one winter coat and only one set of boots.

He immediately stood up and spun around, swivelling his gun at the treeline, his mind reeling with the possible explanations as his body acted on pure instinct and reflexes. Now more than ever, the woods seemed so alien and hostile, the trees all watching him, and it seemed like momentarily, should he turn his back in any one direction, the trees there would begin to immediately inch their way forward towards him from behind, closing the loop tighter and tighter around him, suffocating him.

It was then that he looked again at the carcass lying on the now blackened charcoal and ash of the fire. Although, of course, he would have to have it tested and examined, he already knew in his heart of hearts that it was no deer.

He had radioed in to Kody for help, who was thankfully not busy, and together they combed the campsite, bagged up the remains of the unknown John Doe and the belongings from the tent, taking copious Polaroid photographs of everything beforehand.

Back at the station, Burt sat there, his face buried in his own hands, just breathing, in and out, trying to calm his racing heart that was desperately attempting to catch up to his mind, which was going a million miles an hour. Every inhale felt like an eternity, every exhale a slow loss. Again, and again. Why here, why now, why to him? He couldn’t bear to go down and examine the remains, much less face down the monster Joseph Carter to prove what was already obvious. Maybe it was fear, or simply exhaustion, he simply couldn’t bring himself to do it. At least he was already in custody. He didn’t even hear the ticking of the clock, much less Bill’s approaching footsteps.

“Hey man, you look like shit,” Bill said, standing over him and extending him a hand. “You up for a drink?”

“There’s so much to do…” Burt murmured in half-hearted protest.

“And that is what exactly? We did it, we caught the bastard, ain’t much else we can do except catalogue all the evidence and then present it before the judge on Monday. The facts speak for themselves. In the meantime, he isn’t going anywhere.” Bill said with a tone of voice that betrayed just how equally tired he was.

“Alright, I suppose it can’t hurt.” Burt sighed, getting up and putting on his coat. Still, he cast a quick, terrified look at the doors leading to the small jail and the basement, as if he could feel the man that was sitting there secreting and oozing his menace, his evil from in between the bars, letting it pool in the form of some black goo which will flow out and escape or reshape itself into some new horror. He shuddered. Maybe Ada Brady was right after all.

He and Bill made their way down to Dutch’s Bar, a couple of streets over. It was a nice, hole-in-the-wall place, where even though a no-smoking sign hung on the front door, which had been there for quite some time, your nostrils were still assaulted by the smell of smoke as soon as you swung open the doors. The windows were largely occupied by an air conditioner, which just barely chugged along. Along the edges of the ceiling, dimming neon lights cast the place in a colorful, interesting light, illuminating the walls, which were covered in old 80s movie posters, various sports memorabilia, and even a couple of model planes that hung above. The space was populated by several other patrons, most of whom Burt easily recognized as locals. Beer was a cheap and easy source of calories, cheaper than most other food these days, even watered down as it was. Besides, its main function was, of course, to numb the pain, numb the cold, like a pleasurable microdose of hypothermia.

He and Bill made their way over to the bar, each ordering a shot of some simple locally brewed whisky. While they were waiting, they both couldn’t help but overhear a conversation going on loudly beside them, where a few local men were questioning another man, a traveler who had evidently come from down south and was going to continue the trek northwards again tomorrow. Where he was coming from, and where he was going, they didn’t quite catch.

“How are things down south?” Asked one of the locals, “Buck” Richards, a surly, but generally friendly old timer who could’ve passed for a biker Santa Claus. “I gotta cousin out in Chambersburg, was wondering if you passed through there.”

“Yeah, I’m actually three days out of there,” said the stranger, clearing his throat. “They seem to be doing alright, everything is more or less in good shape, there’s just a lot of rumors going around.”

“Like what?” spoke up Guy Jennings, right beside him, a rowdy, frequent visitor to the bar here. “They’re always making bullshit up to cause a stir and to make themselves feel more important. The only thing really going on down there is those fucking Baltimore refugees mucking up the place.”

“I dunno…” the stranger shrugged. “They say there's a group of ‘merry men’ two dozen strong up in Michaux Forest. They launch raids once a week or so, stealing food, cattle, even some of the last working big rigs. I was told they stood up some of the local militia to come out and try to hunt those bastards down, but they just lay low in the woods, and it's impossible to find them in there.” Here, the stranger looked around, making sure he had the audience’s full attention before continuing, but now with a hushed tone. “There are even rumors going around that the Feds are going to try and take back Harrisburg. The locals have been seeing strange lights on and around Blue Ridge Summit. I think they’re finally going to show their faces. Hell, who knows, maybe they already took Waynesboro as we speak.”

“Fuck…” slurred Guy. “I thought those cocksuckers would have all eaten themselves alive in that concrete hole in the ground of theirs by now.”

“With language like that, shouldn’t you be somewhere else?” Bill couldn’t help but interject.

“What’s the matter, pig?” Guy turned, his face red, visibly fuming at the implication. “Did you get offended on behalf of your buddies?” Burt watched his movements carefully, his own hand already resting on the handle of his revolver, but for all his bluster, Guy thankfully knew better than to try some bullshit and kept both his hands above the bar wrapped tightly around his glass.

“I’m just saying, it's an awful lotta talk.” Bill continued with a devilish grin. Guy looked like he wanted to drop something devilish on Bill, a cornucopia of insults of various calibers just on the tip of his tongue, but noticing Burt’s hand on his gun, and old Dutch reaching with one hand under the bar, he decided against it.

“The only good bluebelly is a damn dead one.” Guy finally muttered to himself in a defeated manner, turning back to his drink.

“Did you really have to do that?” Burt asked his friend worriedly once the few tense moments had passed, and a slightly more relaxed atmosphere returned to the bar.

“You know me, I gotta get my kicks in somehow.” Bill offered a very tired smile. “Helps me let off some steam and get my mind off things. Besides, you know I got it way worse from them good old boys when I was growing up. I could almost see it on his face now, him reaching to call me a slur.”

“Not the only thing he was reaching for,” Burt interjected, “And you know it. No more corpses in the basement, god forbid it's you,” he said, and he could feel tears beginning to well up in his eyes, the whiskey already doing its work. Bill sat next to him in silence for a few moments, as Burt struggled not to lose his composure, flashes of all that he had seen the past two days jumping through his mind at lightning speed.

“You can’t let it get to you like that.” Bill finally spoke up, his voice quiet but deadly serious. “That’s what I learned from dealing with types like him my whole life.” He said, gesturing over his back at Guy, who was drunkenly stumbling out the door. “I know you, old buddy, I know how much you love your Norman Rockwell set to the tune of Johnny Cash, but that existed only for a brief few decades because of a very specific set of circumstances. Hell, it wasn’t even for everyone, not quite for folks like me, that's for sure. And yet, here you are, losing your head over the fact that the world’s just going back to the natural state of things.”

“An innocent girl is dead, and here you are, talking about that’s the way things are?” Burt asked, indignantly. “It’s our damn job to stop that from happening, and we failed, Bill, we failed…”

“And I’m telling you that really is the way things are. There’s always been darkness in this world. I know you’re religious, so it's the devil or demons for you, but for others, it could be evil spirits, djinn, or whatever have you. But really, it doesn’t care for your value judgments, it just is. It's old. It's as much a part of nature as the mountains. It's always been there in the minds of men and women, and always will be. Accept that.” Bill slowly philosophized, “And as for our jobs, well, we’re doing them, aren’t we? We caught the bastard, but you can’t bring back the dead, no matter how many tears you spill. We’re here to serve justice, and justice is only based on revenge.” 

The conversation moved on to other topics, and before they knew it, they had finished four shots each, and both were feeling it. Burt signaled to Dutch, who brought them the bill. They split the total, slapping down some of the new-style dollars. Dutch counted the money and gave a thumbs up to signal that it was all clear, leaving them free to go.

They sauntered out of the bar and onto the bridge crossing the little creek, where their paths split, with Burt heading off in one direction and Bill in another. Still, Burt lingered for a moment, looking down and listening to the running, pitch black waters.

“I wish we were young again, Bill.” Burt muttered, “Can’t even say I’m getting old, just feeling more and more tired with every passing day, like I’m carrying too many memories around on my back. I still can’t help but look back towards simpler, better days…”

“It’s all water under the bridge, man. It turned the waterwheel of the mill, it powered the factory, it served as the steam for the trains, but it doesn’t stop. It keeps flowing. It flowed away and took all the best years with it.” Bill replied solemnly, patting his friend across the back. “Get some rest, and then it's back to work again tomorrow…” he said, before turning and walking off into the night.

He didn’t remember how he went home, opened the door, or collapsed on his bed. The only thing he remembered was the kaleidoscope of images that swirled through his dreams like a whirlpool pulling down a ship into the dark, endless abyss. 

He dreamt of a girl he had once known, about their last night together, the summer before she went to college, and he would enlist. He had shamefully carried these memories of her, locked away deep in his subconsciousness, through years of a fruitless marriage, and now they had returned to haunt him. He remembered borrowing his father’s beloved square-body Chevy and taking her out for a date in it. They had gotten dinner, but afterwards had retired to a small, secluded little vista called Cedar Point overlooking the valley. All beneath them, the lights of the city sparkled and glimmered with all the joy and liveliness of a million multicolored Christmas lights, and all above them the stars twinkled with the promises of uncounted possibilities. 

He had laid out a couple of blankets in the truck’s bed, and they had lain there, their arms and legs intertwined around one another. She always wanted to be an astrophysicist, and she had even won a substantial scholarship for it at an out-of-state college. She lay there, beside him, and pointed out to him her favorite constellations and even the minuscule little dot that supposedly was the then-new ISS. He never saw it of course, nor did the actual stars themselves have any real value to him, but he believed her wholeheartedly when she pointed every little detail, because to him, the most important thing was the way her eyes gleamed and burned with the unquenchable fires of life, which burned with dreams of distant worlds and with such a brightness that they could outshine even the grandest supernovas. He remembered the rest of the night, he remembered her touch, her taste on his tongue, but above all, he remembered her warmth, radiating from every inch of her skin, emanating from those mesmerizing eyes, from somewhere even deeper within her soul. He wanted to scream, to yell through the dream then that he was going to go with her, that he didn’t need to be a cop or a soldier, that he was going to go learn some other trade, or do anything else, but that he will be with her, but for some reason it felt like he was choking, that his throat was closing up and he couldn’t utter a single sound.

The alarm clock rang.

“Please…” he finally managed to beg, but now to an empty room. He tried to forget the phantom pain of an old wound he thought had long since scarred over, forget her name, her face, her touch, and above all her warmth and her eyes. She was somewhere far, far away. He could only hope.

It was cold. It was time to go to work.

He got up, got dressed, and ate a breakfast of cold, soggy oats with a cup of muddy water with barely enough caffeine in it to justify the name “coffee”. He had the funeral of an innocent girl to attend.

Willow Street was an interesting place, very near to the center of town, where the houses were stacked as close together as possible without technically still being a single connected structure, each one trying to outshine its neighbors in terms of grandeur and “sophistication”. At least, that might have been the intention when the houses were brand new. By now, they had become quite run down and crumbling, as if the brick exteriors were just barely holding on to another. All it would seemingly take is one big bad wolf to come and blow it all down. Boarded-up windows, or those draped in ancient, dirty curtains, looked down on him as he drove past. The yards weren’t any better than the houses themselves, with dead flowers and long-since-abandoned landscaping projects surrounding faded political signs to the tune of “Love is Love” and “Hate Has No Home Here,” or various campaign posters which stood like the many charred pikes of vanquished armies, the distant reminders of some long-ago, now irrelevant conflict. The cramped little alleyways in between the walls accumulated impassable piles of trash or barely contained the vicious howling and barking of only half-domesticated dogs behind collapsing fencing.

Similarly, the church specified by Mrs. Morrison was easily identifiable, albeit a highly strange building full of contradictions. Architecturally, it seemed as though it couldn’t fully commit either to the brooding Gothic style, which perhaps harkened back far too closely to the rigidness of Catholic cathedrals, nor could it fully embrace the simplicity and blunt modesty of the little chapels erected by Puritan settlers. Even theologically, it confused him, specifically the little Gay and Trans Pride flags put in place beside the door. Not that he was against them or the people who identified with them or would discourage them from the faith, but that he simply couldn’t square his own fire-and-brimstone evangelical upbringing with this relatively newfound acceptance. From the Sunday services which he remembered attending with his parents, the church of that day would most likely call them sinners and Sodomites, condemning gay people to eternal suffering, much less openly celebrate them and invite them. 

After all, what could explain such a change? It isn’t as if some radical new information was uncovered; it was still the same old scripture, so why such a change? He didn’t want to think too deeply about it; he had done so once before in his life, and it only brought him turmoil and uncertainty. It was best to simply embrace the faith and let the word and compassion of the Lord guide him.

He parked the patrol car and stepped out. The days-old snow had now become a mushy gray sludge under his feet. He checked the scratched and scuffed face of his watch. The ceremony would begin shortly.

Swinging open one of the creaky doors and passing through the vestibule, he entered the nave, whose walls were painted a nauseous shade of greenish-beige. The coffin was already there, lying beside the altar, and many of the attendees were already there as well. It was a handful of the locals from around the block and those who knew the Morrisons personally. He recognized some of the faces, but he wished he didn’t. One woman was terribly familiar to him; he recalled he had booked her in one night when she was in high school for spray painting “ACAB” and “Defund the Police” onto the side of the station, done so carelessly that she didn’t even think to cover her face from the cameras. Now, of course, years had passed, and from what he heard, she now had children of her own, and all of a sudden, her demeanor changed. She glared at him from one of the pews as he passed, silently accusing him of not doing enough.

He sat down and slid towards the very end, leaning down and resting his forehead on the wooden back of the pew in front of him. It was noticeably warmer in the church, of course, than it was outside, but still not warm enough to actually feel comfortable or at ease. He closed his eyes for a moment, recollecting himself and his thoughts, and with a deep breath, composed himself for the service.

“We are gathered here today, on this bleak morning, to mourn the tragic loss of Elisa Morrison, a bright and promising young woman who by the actions of darkness had been taken from us before her time. And yet, she passes on now to the heavens, where she shall be in the embrace of our Lord and saviour, and where she also shall be reunited with her father.” The priest, an elderly but thin man, began. “It is in days such as these that I recall the words of Mathew who spoke, ‘Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.”

After the prayer was over, many of Elisa’s relatives and friends went up and made statements, recalling the moments of joy which Elisa had brought into their lives. Even her mother, who had managed to put herself together long enough to deliver a truly heart-rending speech recalling holding her daughter in her arms as a newborn for the first time, before falling to her knees and kissing the polished wood of the coffin, one last time.

He could barely hear most of the words, but he didn’t need to; he simply wept.

As the statements came to an end, it was time for the burial itself, and the pallbearers carefully lifted the coffin and carried it out through the door and towards the graveyard across the street. The procession followed suit, but Burt stayed. 

He had already done his part, paid his respects, and that was not the only reason he was here. He carefully watched all of the faces of the attendees, solemn and grim. Several of Elisa’s friends from school had come, but Julia still remained absent. As the procession exited, aside from himself and the priest, one more figure remained, Hunter Dugan. He rose from the pews where he was sitting closer to the front and approached the priest. The two had a brief interaction, which Burt could not overhear, but he saw the priest nod his head and lead the boy towards a small room in the back of the church.

A few minutes later, Hunter emerged, his eyes red from crying, still audibly sniffling. He quickened his pace and speedwalked out of the door, in a hurry to rejoin the funeral group, in the proccess casting a distrustful momentary glance at Burt. He got up and stepped over to the priest, who looked at him expectantly.

‘What did that young man just say to you?” Burt asked him directly, dropping all pretense.

“I’m afraid I cannot tell you, sir. I have made my vow, and I cannot betray his confession,” the priest responded calmly but sternly. Burt thought the answer over for a minute, weighing his options.

“I understand, and in that case, good day to you, and thank you for the service,” he said.

“I will pray for your success, officer.” the priest gave a slight bow of respect, and Burt nodded in return before walking out of the church.

He drove back over to the station. Tomorrow, there was going to be a “trial” held for Joseph Carter, and he had to make sure all of the evidence was ready to be presented in a clear and coherent manner. There was a small courtroom in the town’s municipal building, and there was a real judge who was going to be overseeing the proceedings and a real jury, although Burt doubted that those assembled would truly be Joseph’s peers. But much of the process and fanfare of the trial would, of course, be much different than the way it was done back in the days of the United States. Joseph would, of course, have no public defender assigned to him, and even if they had found someone, he was certain they would refuse to do so given the nature of the case. The man would have to represent himself for what he did. Lastly, the punishments doled out were different as well. Joseph already knew what was waiting for him. This was frontier justice.

“Hey, if you don’t got anything else going on right now, take your time, talk to the motherfucker, try and get him to confess or at least to talk.” Burt tasked Kody with the dirty work as he walked into the station. Something about the man terrified him, not the man himself physically, but rather the notion of who he was, what he was capable of. He would rather re-examine the bones downstairs rather than waste his time interrogating Joseph for a hypothetical confession he knew the man would never give.

“Yes, sir,” the young officer said, finishing up with some paperwork which he was shuffling around on his desk, and headed off to the jail cell.

Burt descended the stairs and turned on the light. It was just ribs and a spine, nothing else, nothing even left on the bones themselves to actually decay, although the disgusting smell of death still hung in the air. He wondered how long it would take to get it to air out. Based on the size alone, it appeared to be a large adult man. Furthermore, the sternum was absent entirely, potentially broken, and ripped out. There was no way of telling if this injury was what killed him or if this was done posthumously in order to butcher him. 

He couldn’t help but gag at the thought.

There wasn’t anything left that could possibly identify the victim, nothing that could tie these bones to a face and a name. He pored over them in detail, but the only things of note that he saw were the human teeth marks left on the ribs. Whoever the man was, he most likely had come with Joseph himself, as there hadn’t been any missing persons reported from the town, especially none matching these remains. As morbid as it was, the fact calmed Burt just a little bit, and he was ashamed that it did.

After going over the remains and taking measurements and pictures of the bite marks, he began to catalog and examine the rest of the equipment recovered from the camp. Some of it was already bagged and catalogued by Kody, including what was certainly the murder weapon: a bloody hatchet found lying on a nearby stump, although the blood on it wasn’t fresh and had already dried to a brown, rusty layer when they recovered it. He was thus occupied when he had heard a loud, earsplitting boom followed by a scream. Undoubtedly a gunshot.",4,1753053396.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1m534rt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m534rt,Making Room for Fantasy: the New Exhibits to Memento Mile,"Hey, fellow curators. 

Just like many of you, I’m also finding it a bit challenging to fit all the Fantasy exhibits into a non-exclusive museum. So I wanted to share how I’m trying to make it work and integrate the Fantasy theme into my current game and also open up the game to share ideas and make some collective intelligence 😃

So I chose Memento Mile as the host museum because I had a lot of lots that I hadn't used yet. I’ve probably unlocked around 40% of the DLC content (which, by the way, I’m really, really loving.) I started by using one of the lots to build a medieval town with a marketplace, a town square, and a forest area. That’s the vibe I’m going for and it’s what you’ll see in the pictures. Let me walk you through it.

Area 1 - Town Square

In the first area, there’s a small square with some orchards, storefronts, and market stands. that’s what the guests see first when they enter. There’s a gift shop, a map kiosk, a coffee stand, and a couple of exhibits. The vibe I’m aiming for is a cozy, autumn-themed medieval town. the kind of place where visitors can relax, gear up, and get ready for adventure.

Area 2 - Forest

From the town, guests head straight into the forest, where they’re greeted by the Stone Trolls (honestly, one of my favorite exhibits so far, with that clear Lord of the Rings.) As they go deeper into the forest, they’ll pass by (or stumble into) different exhibits: the Teeny Kettle Genie’s house (which they’ll need to enter through his garden)the abandoned Devilish Door, and even a cozy tavern where they can warm up with a decent meal… and check out the Three-Handed Greatsword on display.

Area 3 - Magical Deep Forest

As guests venture deeper into the forest, things start to feel a bit more… magical. The plants get weirder, some start whispering, and if you stand still long enough, you might spot creatures moving in the underbrush. I’m trying to blend in some of the Space Botanical exhibits here, and so far, I think they actually fit the vibe. Still a work in progress, though!",34,1753053386.0,TwoPointMuseum,6,0.98,False

I, on the other hand, was the budget spreadsheet guy. The one who could tell you how much I spent on coffee in June of 2022.

So naturally, when it came to dates, I usually picked up the tab. No biggie. I figured we were building something, and in relationships, sometimes one person handles more until it balances out.

One night, we ordered Thai food. $27.50 total. I paid. She offered to “split it,” and I said, “Nah, I got it.”

The next day… she Venmo’d me **$1.75** with the note:

At first, I laughed. Cute, right?

Then I realized she sent *nothing* for the actual meal. Just the **spring roll**. Like her financial contribution to our love life was strictly limited to deep-fried appetizers.

I stared at that $1.75 for a long time. I didn’t accept or reject it. Just let it sit there. Like my dignity.

In the end, it wasn’t about the money. It was about the fact that I might be dating someone who thinks spring rolls are a fair split in a four-year relationship.

I wish her well. I hope she’s still thriving. And I hope her next boyfriend really loves budgeting… because he’s gonna need it.",1,1753053237.0,relationship_family22,0,1.0,False
1m532pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1m532pw/my_doctor_has_no_idea/,"My doctor has ""no idea.""","Asking for help on an internet forum isn't always the wisest thing to do but I'm strapped for options at this point.

There's a TL;DR at the end, because I feel like the entire story is necessary. So much has been ruled out (including anxiety, though my psychologist has acknowledged that what's been going on has been making my anxiety worse) that whatever this is can't be figured out just by listing a bunch of vague, widespread symptoms.

I am 25F. For the past decade or so, I have dealt with fatigue, low appetite and occasionally nausea, chronic pain, weak joints, GERD, a high sensitivity to air quality, brain fog, painful and heavy periods, and intermittent orthostatic hypertension. I live a largely sedentary lifestyle due to this.

For the last 4 years I would occasionally experience sudden sleepiness after eating large meals.

For the past 2 years, these episodes of sleepiness came with a feeling of shortness of breath and a racing heart. If I layed down flat on the ground and drank water, they would go away within 10 minutes, and I would be fine to get back up and continue what I was doing.

August of last year, I started adderall, which did nothing and made my blood pressure weird, so I switched to ritalin, which finally started to help with my symptoms.

The beginning of May, I started physical therapy to try and improve my health. It was difficult, exhausting, and painful but I was sticking to it.

May 23rd, I had what I thought was a ""just ate sleepy"" episode, and layed down on the floor. It got worse. I was so dizzy I thought I was going to pass out. I started to feel air hunger like I was suffocating but I tried to keep my breathing slow. My legs, hands, and face went numb. I had trouble talking. My mom said I was stone cold and my extremities were pale. I couldn't stand. EMTs tried to get a glucose test but couldn't get any blood out of my finger. Ambulance came and carried me out on a stretcher. In the ambulance my entire body went numb and stiff. My chest felt like it was being crushed and it took all of my strength to push against it to breathe. EMT said my oxygen was ""great.""

In the ER, they did a bunch of tests (Chest CT, blood and urine) and found nothing, told me it was my anxiety, gave me a dose of Xanax and sent me home. 

It got worse. I couldn't sleep. Every time I started to doze off I'd wake up gasping for air. My sister sat by my bedside and watched my pulsometer which never dropped below 90 and shot up to 120 every time I woke up. My PCP put me on prazosin, buspirone, and omeprazole. I noticed no change except that my appetite was better- but it didn't matter because suddenly I couldn't swallow solid food. I couldn't eat anything for the next 3 days. I would choke whenever I tried. I dropped to 97 pounds. 

We went back to the ER. They did the same tests again, then an abdominal ultrasound. Found ""nothing,"" and sent me home.

I tried everything to manage my ""anxiety"" at home. I tried watching some of my favorite shows with my boyfriend, I tried grounding techniques and breathing exercises. I talked to my therapist on the phone as I tried everything she told me to do to ""calm down"" and nothing helped. I was in so much discomfort I described being on fire as preferable and considered hurting myself as a distraction.

I went back to the ER 5 times at the request of every doctor I spoke to. The fourth time, I had the doctor attending me call my psychologist so she could explain to him that this did not present like my anxiety has in the past and likely was not the cause, but this failed and they still sent me home. They used the fact that I came back multiple times as proof that it was anxiety.

I took my BP and it was shooting up and down, anywhere from 80s/50s to 150s/100s. As far as I could tell the meds were not addressing the issue. I was taken off the prazosin and put on 30mg propranolol twice a day which also didn't seem to be doing much. I was put on cyproheptadine and pantoprazole as well.

I requested being taken off the buspirone because it did seem to be making my anxiety worse and my anxiety improved but of course the rest of the symptoms were still present. I was put on clonazepam, which was the only thing that seemed to consistently help take the edge off. I tried to take it as sparingly as possible for when the symptoms were the worst.

Over the next 2 absolutely horrible months I saw many specialists. I took a sleep test and they said it was normal. I had an MRI of my brain and they said I had some small protein-filled cysts on my pituitary but that it was normal and not causing my symptoms. 

Apparently the ER found a huge kidney stone and didn't tell me, but my PCP saw it on the chart.

There were also other things they found and didn't tell me about that I'll put in the TLDR (currently we aren't doing anything about them cause they aren't causing problems)

My PCP made the ""working diagnosis"" that the kidney stone was causing autonomic nervous system dysfunction. It was a long shot but it was her best guess.

At the urologist, as we discussed the surgery that would be needed to remove it, she told me that she did not think it was causing my problems.

I saw a cardiologist and asked about pulmonary hypertension and vagus nerve damage, as others have suggested to me in the past. He just told me it can't be either of those things and added that my symptoms are too widespread for it to be a problem with my heart. 

I'm going to have an echo to make sure my heart is okay for the surgery so hopefully they will look and find something. I don't know. I'm kind of worried the bias towards it being my anxiety will cause them to miss a problem with my heart and then something bad will happen in surgery :') I do have to be opened up for it and I have no idea how I'm going to recover in the state I'm in.

Also important to mention that I did smoke weed before this (usually less than a grain of rice's worth at a time) but I stopped as soon as it started. I also stopped taking my ritalin and drinking anything that has caffeine in it.

If you did read all of this, thank you, I know it's a lot but I think we really need to look past the basics to actually identify what's going on. Regardless here's the tldr:

* primary symptoms: debilitating shortness of breath, blood pressure spikes and drops, difficulty swallowing, heart palpitations, coughing, sleep disturbances, fullbody pain centralized in chest and back, numbness in extremities, dizziness, fatigue, heightened anxiety.

* these symptoms started on May 23rd without any identifiable trigger besides that I was eating food.

* history of various disabling health issues such as asthma, fatigue, low appetite, chronic pain (back, legs, neck/shoulders) memory problems, dysmenorhhea, insomnia, anxiety/depression/ADHD.

* clear chest CT, abdominal ultrasound found 2 endometrial polyps. 2 Brain MRIs found minor cysts on pituitary. Fullbody CT found 2.1 cm kidney stone on the left side, otherwise clear. Many blood tests all clear. Urine clear aside from blood and crystals from the kidney stone.

* Medications I'm on: Albuterol, cyproheptadine, propranolol, clonazepam (sparingly), ondansetron, pantoprazole

* Smoked weed, took ritalin and drank coffee in the past but stopped all of this as soon as this started

1m532in,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1m532in/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_to_call_off_his/,AITA for telling my best friend to call off his wedding?,"Two years ago my best friend, let’s call him Andre, decided to get married to a girl, we’ll call her Laura, he was in love with. I had actually introduced her to my friends group and they ended up liking each other and dating for a couple of years. 

Their relationship was quite unstable, they were on and off and at times it was very hard to tell if they were still together, and the fact that they later were in a long distance relationship, didn’t help.

She’d often call me and complain about him, his family members, and how their background and status don’t match. To which I’d be surprised because why would you talk shit about my best friend? But I always told her to take some time and do what she preferred doing. I wasn’t giving any specific advice to her because I knew they’d be back together in no time and any advice give to her would just completely backfire at me.

Fast forward to when they are engaged: I was helping him to buy some of the wedding gifts for her and her family because she was living abroad and there were local things he wanted to bring for them. At a certain point Andre tells me: “you know, sometimes I wish I had cheated on her.” I still remember this statement so vividly because a part of me wanted to slap him but I also wanted to understand what made him say such an awful thing. I immediately ask him to sit for a coffee and explain why he would say something so ridiculous.

He tells me everything that she has put him through and that he cannot believe he was faithful to this woman because she didn’t deserve it(????!!!!). I get the feeling that perhaps he is just having cold feet before his wedding and try to tell him that maybe he is just overwhelmed and he should just sleep it off and forget about it. BUT he starts giving me a lot of information about how she has actively tried to sabotage his feelings and completely disregard his or his family’s wishes. He says that she told him that his apartment, for example, shows his class because her family would never even walk by the street where his home is and to think she would have to move there is making her super uncomfortable. He tell me more stories but they were all in line with the fact that Laura had a feeling she deserved better, as she came from a higher social class, and Andre had to deal with it and put up with this behaviour because he was marrying someone who was richer than him.

A lot of the information he gave me, for example the social class thing, were not completely new because she had mentioned them to me prior to that day, so I didn’t find it hard to believe him, but some of the things were just a little too complicated. 

Thing is though, no matter how many expectations she had, or how much of an brat she might have been to him, nothing justifies him stating that he wishes he had cheated on her. So, after carefully listening to him and his concerns, I tell him: “listen, I know you love her. I am not sure if this is your cold feet speaking, but I think that if you are thinking about cheating on your soon to be wife, something is wrong with that. Now, is there something you can do to fix how you feel? Because if this is how you feel, or have been feeling in awhile, the best thing to do is not marrying the person you want to cheat on. Because chances are that you will, eventually, cheat on her.”

He said that they have many complications and that distance never helped them but that he loves when he is with her and that problems never arise when they are in the same room. That’s when I tell Andre that he is an adult, and he is a very educated and mature person, so he can decide what’s best for him. I honestly had a lot to say but I zipped it because in the scenario where they were getting married, I didn’t want him to think that I never wanted then together. I didn’t want to cause any trouble.

He then leaves for the country where the bride resides and two days later Laura texts me, infuriated, because apparently I tried to manipulate him and ruin their relationship (?????) and that she is mad that I would try to sabotage their relationship. She says that she thought she could trust me but that I was a very bad friend to both parties. 

I’m just shocked when I read her texts because I cannot try to think of any reason why I would be the reason to sabotage their relationship? Yes, I told him to think about his decision to marry Laura, but that’s because he said he WOULD HAVE CHEATED ON HER??? Was I just supposed to stay silent?

I text him to ask what had happened and what he had told her to make her mad at me, but he says that it must’ve been some kind of miscommunication. I ask him to clear it up but he doesn’t seem to care. He stops texting me, proceeds to unfollow me, and completely disappears from my life. I tried to reach him out but he completely disregarded my concerns about our friendship. 

A few months later I happened to know through a friend that they indeed got married. Mind you, he was my best friend. And I can’t believe he got married and never even thought of telling me. While I was mourning a friendship, he couldn’t care less about what he was making me go through. But yeah, good to know I was pouring my energy to a friendship that was perhaps one sided all along.

Till this day I am trying to understand what is it that I did wrong. AITA for telling him not to marry her if he felt like cheating on her?",12,1753053220.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The following are essential features to consider when selecting gable table legs:

**Material:** The material of gable table legs directly impacts their durability, aesthetics, and suitability for different environments.

Solid wood, such as maple, oak, or walnut, offers natural beauty, strength, and the ability to be stained or painted to match any décor. Metal legs, typically made of steel or iron, provide a modern, industrial look and exceptional sturdiness. Hybrid options, combining wood and metal, offer a balance of aesthetics and strength. The choice of material depends on the desired style and the intended use of the table.

**Dimensions:** Accurate dimensions are crucial for ensuring the stability and visual appeal of the table.

Height determines the overall table height, which should be appropriate for its intended use (e.g., dining, working, or display). Leg thickness affects the table's stability and visual weight; thicker legs provide greater support and a more substantial appearance. Top plate dimensions, where the legs attach to the table top, must be compatible with the tabletop's thickness and material. Ensure that the leg dimensions are proportionate to the tabletop size to create a balanced and aesthetically pleasing design.

**Finish:** The finish of gable table legs enhances their appearance and protects them from wear and tear.

Common finishes include stains, paints, varnishes, and powder coatings. Stains accentuate the natural grain of wood, while paints offer a wide range of color options. Varnishes provide a protective layer against scratches and moisture. Powder coatings, typically used on metal legs, offer a durable, chip-resistant finish. The choice of finish should complement the table's overall design and provide adequate protection for the intended environment.

**Style & Design:** Gable table legs come in various styles and designs, ranging from simple and minimalist to ornate and decorative.

Consider the overall aesthetic of the table and choose legs that complement its style. Simple, straight-lined gable legs are suitable for modern or minimalist designs, while more elaborate, curved legs may be better suited for traditional or farmhouse-style tables. Pay attention to details such as the shape of the gable, the presence of decorative elements, and the overall proportions of the legs.

**Weight Capacity:** The weight capacity of gable table legs is a critical factor, especially for larger or heavier tables.

Ensure that the legs can safely support the weight of the tabletop and any items placed on it. Check the manufacturer's specifications for the maximum weight capacity of each leg. Consider the intended use of the table and choose legs that provide an adequate safety margin. For heavier tables, it may be necessary to use additional support structures, such as aprons or braces, to distribute the weight evenly.

**Adjustability:** Some gable table legs offer height adjustability, allowing for customization and leveling on uneven floors.

Adjustable legs typically feature threaded feet that can be screwed in or out to raise or lower the table height. This feature is particularly useful for dining tables or desks, where precise height adjustments are essential for comfort. Consider the range of adjustability and ensure that it meets your specific needs. Adjustable legs can also be helpful for accommodating future changes in flooring or furniture arrangements.

## Core Benefits

**Enhanced Stability:** Gable table legs provide excellent stability due to their angled design and sturdy construction. This ensures that the table remains steady and wobble-free, even when subjected to heavy loads or uneven surfaces. The angled shape of the legs distributes weight evenly, minimizing the risk of tipping or collapsing.

**Improved Aesthetics:** The distinctive gabled shape adds a touch of elegance and visual interest to any table. Whether you prefer a classic, traditional look or a more modern, minimalist design, gable table legs can enhance the overall aesthetic appeal of your furniture. The legs can be customized with various finishes and decorative elements to complement your personal style.

**Versatile Design Options:** Gable table legs are suitable for a wide range of table styles, from dining tables and desks to coffee tables and side tables. Their versatility makes them a popular choice for both DIY projects and professional furniture design. They can be paired with various tabletop materials, including wood, glass, and metal, to create unique and customized pieces.

**Easy Installation:** Most gable table legs are designed for easy installation, making them accessible to DIY enthusiasts of all skill levels. They typically come with pre-drilled holes and mounting hardware, allowing for quick and straightforward attachment to the tabletop. Even if you're not an experienced woodworker, you can easily install gable table legs and create a beautiful and functional table in no time.

**Long-Term Durability:** Constructed from high-quality materials such as solid wood or steel, gable table legs are built to last. They can withstand daily wear and tear, providing years of reliable support. The durable finishes protect the legs from scratches, moisture, and other environmental factors, ensuring that they maintain their appearance and functionality over time.

So I set to work cleaning all of that up again. Blood out of a stone is a nifty little saying for good reason.
And finally, after a hard days work I kick back and relax with a scented candle on to admire my cleaning skills. 
To which obi joins me, with a LIVE FROG in his mouth. 

Ps- frogs are not easy to catch. They are extremely fast and slippery. I am out of breath. ",7,1753052897.0,cats,0,0.9,False

The only thing that makes me unsure is dates. He hasn’t taken me on an official date yet. In my previous dating experiences I would go on a date about 2nd week in or something.

I even try to suggest “let’s do something this weekend”, or I’ll name a specific thing I want to do. He will say something along the lines of I’ll think about it but never folllows up. However he will call me every night like clockwork.

He has expressed to me that he wants a relationship, and he doesn’t believe in being a couple for too long without making plans like marriage etc moving in together.

I have constantly expressed that I like to do anything, even getting coffee together is my favorite date. We haven’t even done that. Also he has said he is a homebody but I get that but still need to date as a couple no?

Is he potentially using me?",1,1753052882.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False
