My friends are amazing, but I'm searching for a new kindred spirit to share this adventure with.**

**Lately, I've been reflecting on my goals and aspirations. I've dated casually, but it's never felt truly fulfilling. Watching my friends find their partners makes me hopeful yet a bit nervous about finding that special someone who truly understands me.

It would be incredible to meet someone who shares these interests or introduces me to new ones.**

**Has anyone else felt the weight of these thoughts? How did you overcome the fear of opening up to someone new? I'm looking for someone who I can connect with on a deeper level, someone who makes me feel valued and understood. Is that too much to hope for? Let's chat and see where our conversation takes us.**

I really wanted a little but of money so I tried my best to get my symptoms under control before I started working. For the most part I was actually able to get my flare up control and I started working. The first day was fine but the second day was just too hot and they had me doing tasks that required a lot of bending down and reaching up. This caused all my symptoms to flare again and I was bed ridden for days. I told them I cant work anymore but I just feel so sad. Im proud of myself for trying but it sucks not being able to do all these simple things that everyone else can do. My plan originally was to just ask if I could work once a week but even then I can‚Äôt control what state Im in on the days I have to work. Sometimes just a smallest can cause a flare up and I know I would either end up forcing myself to do things when I need to rest or I would just become an incredibly unreliable employee. The place seemed super nice and like they would help accommodate me to the best of their ability but my body is just so unpredictable. Uuggh.,2,1732118747.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

1gvsu6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1gvsu6j/ranting_cause_im_kinda_pissed/,Ranting cause I‚Äôm kinda pissed.,"I‚Äôm new to poly and it‚Äôs something my partner and I have talked about for months now. Decided to pull the trigger. Did the Feeld app for 3 weeks and nothing. Well, not entirely. I got one message from someone that wanted to have a 3some and another message that was spam. I‚Äôm in a conservative state, and with the area I live in I knew it would be slim pickens but I ran out of profiles within the first 2 weeks. I  was a bit frustrated so I decided to try OkCupid. I was one it for maybe 2 days and got a 13 likes, but of course it‚Äôs behind a paywall. I was skeptical at first but though what the hell, it‚Äôs obviously going better than Feeld so I paid for the premium. Boy do I feel dumb. All those likes were from other countries, now a few days later I haven‚Äôt received one like. Not from local or out of country. I know it‚Äôs going to take time. I love to fish, and you absolutely need patience when fishing. But damn I just feel so duped. They really got me. A part of me thinks maybe my profile is just ass which has caused me to edit it here and there. The other part thinks I was doomed from the start. I‚Äôm still gonna work through it and put the negative thoughts behind me. Just damn I guess..

EDIT: Here‚Äôs my summary/bio if anyone has any advice. 

Hello there. New to Poly/ENM, my partner and I are dating separately. I‚Äôm looking for someone to have cool conversations with, fun, laughs, and see where it goes from there. Texting? Dating? Random calls? It‚Äôs all about building a connection and the rest comes easy! I‚Äôm a ‚Äúgo with the flow‚Äù person and very easy going, pretty open to anything and everything. If there‚Äôs a question or something you‚Äôre curious about, just ask. I will not hesitate to answer. Honesty is the best policy and all that! I enjoy watching movies any chance I get and know a lot of random movie trivia. Definitely love horror movies. I‚Äôm pretty competitive, especially when it comes to board games. I‚Äôve been working out, not the best, but it‚Äôs been a journey. Music is probably my favorite thing in life. I‚Äôve played a few instruments over the years, but never really mastered any. You can put on any music and I‚Äôll enjoy it through and through. Although live music is the best. Internally I‚Äôm an introvert, and externally I‚Äôm an extrovert. I love to go out, hang with friends, fish, take a walk, anything that gets the heart racing. But I will always be down to stay home on a Friday night to watch a movie, play some games, or start a new book and finish it some other time. Ready to grab a drink or meet up for some coffee.

I also love lattes.  I tried making stove top ones moka pots but I always burned them and I don‚Äôt really like the taste of pour overs or French press, so I mostly stuck too matcha for an at home drink and lattes were a fun beverage I could get when out and about. My partners dad is a big coffee drinker (he has one of the original Vertuo machines) and he saw me use his machine a couple of times to make myself lattes when I was over. 

(Fast forward to August 2023)
I moved into my first apartment a few months later and as a birthday gift / congrats on the new apartment gift, they bought me a vertuo pop in aqua mint. I love this machine a lot and am very grateful! The shade of blue is another one of my favorite colors and it made me feel very loved to know that they noticed the handful of times I used it. It‚Äôs the perfect machine for my current lifestyle, especially because I mostly just drink lattes and other espresso based beverages. 

(Fast forward to march 2024)
I had this nightmare / stress dream about my vertuo in which my partner and his parents knew that there was a pink machine available but intentionally didn‚Äôt buy me it. It was a very strange dream but I remember waking up very upset that they knew about a pink option but chose not to get it, I then realized it was a dream and everything was fine lol. The pink vertuo then became a running joke with all of us, especially because there had been a limited edition one that sold out immediately that none of us knew about. 

Anyways, as I‚Äôm sure you all are aware of, Nespresso added pink to the permanent line up! This made us all laugh really hard, but regardless, as cute as the pink one is (and it would match all my other kitchen stuff!!!!) I love my little blue machine and I don‚Äôt need more than one.

1gvsrc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/fulbright/comments/1gvsrc8/advice_for_current_and_future_fulbright_etas/,Advice for Current and Future Fulbright ETAs,"The Fulbright ETA program works for me, and I am very grateful and feel honored to have been selected. When applying to ANY program, whether that be to graduate school or an educational grant such as a Fulbright ETA award, you need to do your homework and count the costs ahead of time. This subreddit and the Slack FB website are both great resources to help everyone do just that.  
  
I live quite well on my ETA stipend. An updated Soviet-era flat is my home. I live alone, go to a caf√© each morning for coffee and a biscotti, and eat out at a restaurant almost every evening. Rent and living expenses, including meals and daily taxi, run me less than $1K per month. Almost every weekend I travel by train, plane, or taxi to a new city within my chosen country. FB has paid for trips, meals, and hotels for professional development and FB-related events.

Although my placement city is very conservative (Islamic), I feel very safe here. I have made local friends and do a lot of traveling and city exploring with them. They have been eager to show me their country, and I have been just as eager to experience and learn as much as I can. My FB experience has been nothing short of amazing.

That being said, some of the Fulbrighters in my cohort are not having a great time. The negative aspects associated with living abroad consume their headspace. I hear all kinds of complaints about food, dust, cultural challenges, workload, loneliness, homesickness, and whatever. For a few, even the results of this past presidential election has put them into a major funk that they cannot seem to shake. It is easy to allow yourself to become fixated and consumed with what isn't perfect IF YOU ALLOW IT.

Also, if you're planning to do a Fulbright ETA for the prestige factor alone, you're doing it for the wrong reason. This is an ambassadorial service program as much as it is an education-based service program, and you will be connecting with all kinds of people: foreign students, university faculty, teachers, local citizenry, peers, and supervisors. Directly or indirectly, they all will be observing you. Your service to Fulbright is not about you and what Fulbright can do for you. It's about you giving of yourself and hopefully growing in the process. It's about the people with whom you will engage and interact. What you say and do matters to more people than just you. 

With regard to your Fulbright ETA placement, if you find that the obstacles and challenges before you are too great for you to find your happy place, it is probably best to pack it up and go home instead of shading the Fulbright program and spreading negativity. The Fulbright program is not perfect. The country/city to which you will be placed is not perfect. The people around you are not perfect. Keep this truism in the back of your mind: *you have people; you have problems*. Instead of being a cornucopia of negativity, try to be positive. It's a choice. Adapt and survive. Better yet, thrive. With a little planning and a positive attitude, Fulbright can be an amazing and worthwhile experience.",2,1732118328.0,fulbright,0,1.0,False

1gvsn5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterloo/comments/1gvsn5q/thoughts_on_flying_flair/,Thoughts on flying Flair ,"Our family of four took a last minute trip to Orlando. We were planning on taking Air Canada, but pulled up Flair as a point of comparison, it was like >2k cheaper when comparing air canada flights at reasonable times. We don't have a lot of experience on budget airlines but decided to give it a whirl. 

Notes:

1. The flair website wants you to buy more. Insurance, luggage packages, seat selection, etc. etc. You need to check out carefully in order to avoid having extra things thrown at you.
2. Not checking in online will cost you $. 
3. Not needing to drive to and from Pearson, let alone pay for parking at pearson was nice.
4. Flair charges for ""carry on"" items, a ""personal item"" is free. 
5. Flair has someone standing in the check in line actually making you put your possessions in the sized holders. They are not large. If your ""personal item"" doesn't fit in the box you're going to need to pay for the ""carry on"" tag. 
6. There is no fight for overhead space. Because Flair enforces their own policies there's *plenty* of room up there. 
7. The mentality to into this with is ""you want to fly cheap, flair doesn't think you've bought enough add-ons. [Fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRbe5dsyzaM)"". 
8. You do not clear US Customs at Kitcher-Waterloo Airport. You'll clear them in Orlando. 
9. Plane interior is used and beaten up. Actual seat comfort seemed comparable with Rouge though. I'm tall, if I wasn't able to steal my kid's leg room I would not have enjoyed this flight.
10. No in-seat entertainment stuff, it's a discount airline. In theory there's an app you can download and watch some stuff on your own device, it wasn't working on my flight. 
11. Customs when you return doesn't have a lot of wickets, but it's also only one plane of people. 
12. There's no first class lounges at Kitchener airport. There is a Stockyards coffee shop that makes decent breakfast sandwiches though. 
13. Flair doesn't have a lot of planes, or run a lot of routes. If an Air Canada plane breaks down in Orlando there's three other direct flights from Orlando to Toronto that day, plus lots of connecting options through other Canadian destinations. Flair flies Orlando to Kitchener twice a week. 

  
It wasn't very comfortable, but neither is sitting in traffic on the 401 waiting for one of my kids to need to pee. We'll consider them for our next trip. 

That said, discount airlines change or discontinue routes all the time. They also go under with some frequency. I probably wouldn't try to book something on Flair a year out and count on it happening.

i‚Äôm wondering if there could be any other reason for my battery draining other than it just being old. my dad is convinced that ‚Äúsomething is draining the battery‚Äù and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not starting every few days and requiring a charge, rather than the battery just being being three years old and due for a change. this morning my car started right up after it‚Äôs been drawing normal voltage the past week. i went to go get coffee and left my lights on for around 5 minutes. when i went to start my car, it barely cranked once and the dash started buzzing. now, i am CONVINCED i just need a new battery, but, in the case my dad could be right, what else could be causing this?

1gvsi2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1gvsi2t/my_personal_take_on_procrastination/,My Personal Take on Procrastination,"So I've been lurking for the past 3 months just trying to see what others are going through with trying to be productive and combat procrastination.

I wanted to give a personal take on the subject since I've actually been able to make some strides towards this mental battle and honestly hoping that I can shed some light or just a better perspective overall with trying to get through procrastinating and the insane amount of ADHD everyone seems to be going through.

Firstly, I'm a man of no actual importance I just analyze the hell out of everything and get creative with solutions that work for myself personally. This is mainly due to the fact that the school system failed me so I had to come up with crafty ways to keep myself on top of my game throughout my entire life because I've had absolutely no structure or disciplinary parenting.

Honestly, growing up and having a system from semi-understanding and stern parents, plus a strong school schedule is something that I think a lot of us take for granted and forget that we're truly blessed with. This is something I can't say because I've had absolutely none of it growing up, and I'm 23 now struggling to even find out what it is that I'm trying to do with my life and can't even pick a career path because my brain weens it out and gets shiny object syndrome at every turn.   
  
(SOS ""shiny object syndrome"" is pretty much where you see money in everywhere and everything and can't make a decision)

I've been on my adventure to try and find answers to my own procrastination for years and years. Every strategy, self help book, therapist, coffee, environment, has never worked lmao and it's pissed me off more times than I can count.

Thing is, I evaluated from what other people have done before that's worked for them, but have I ever taken a second to evaluate really what works for me on a personal level? Nope! Not until about a month ago where I took a step back and evaluated every core aspect about myself and dug deep into the traumatic roots of my own past to see what could have possibly been the issue.

Which I already said this before ""lazy school, lazy parents"". Also I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was about 12 years old and forgive me for saying this but it's definitely developed later on in my years. 

So, I analyzed myself throughout the course of a month, and every night I took notes on stuff that my brain did to get me away from doing things, and when it didn't, I can confidently say I now know where all my roots are and how to pull them out of the ground.

My brain puts things on top of each other, think about a never ending game of Jenga where the blocks just never fell but every 5 minutes I put a new block on top of the tower. I'd be doing something productive but then my brain finds an excuse to outpower that one thing that had significant importance with its own made up reasoning that this other thing is going to be more important than the thing I was already doing.

Please keep in mind I'm not wrong, I can't actually recall a time besides working a 9-5 that I've actually got something bigger for myself done.

If the thing I'm doing isn't in intervals of 5 to 10 minutes before my brain interrupts and needs stimulation for its own needs then that thing I was set to do that was important most likely isn't getting done at all. It's not like I'm going to get back to it, instead each thing that it stacks on top of each other is something different each time.

So yeah, that's my personal take on why I procrastinate, and it's a mental battle not just for me but for everyone going through something similar. 

My advice to you indefinitely is to see what the root cause is that's plaguing you on a personal level because everyone works differently. You are a different person than everyone else memory with your own story and different circumstances in your life story give you different problems that you probably don't even know about. since it's different there's a reason why most of the strategies don't work. Spark your own creativity because you have ADHD and it's a superpower.",1,1732117662.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

1gvshfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gvshfc/dissociation_man_by_nicholas_leonard/,Dissociation Man by Nicholas Leonard,"My name is Matthew Did, and I lost the ability to be worried about anything. Anything. Absolutely anything, especially myself. I‚Äôm not depressed. I actually quite enjoy life and I‚Äôm capable of finding enjoyment in being awake and conscious, but something happened the other day that made me realize I am without a fundamental human ingredient. I don‚Äôt know why I lost this or where it went, but I just don‚Äôt have it. I was the victim of a sextortion scam.¬†

**Something to know about Matthew Did!** the title of the groupchat on instagram was. The user, who I thought was some Australian woman, had made a group chat on Instagram with about fifty or so of my followers. Old high school classmates. A neighbor. I stopped checking to see the people in the group chat, blocked the culprit and left the group chat. Everything was there alright, damning evidence and all, a whole gallery of photos and videos that I did actually send to this supposed woman- and yet I drank my coffee nonchalantly while watching the sun rise outside my apartment window.¬†

Yeah, I got a little startled when I saw it, but this was the morning that I realized my reflexes were very ill. I didn‚Äôt tremble. I didn‚Äôt get sick to my stomach. I just drank my coffee and watched the sun nurse the beaten down infrastructure of Lynn, Massachusetts. The houses might‚Äôve been pretty once. Not many people sat on their porches anymore. I didn‚Äôt have a porch. I had a balcony that had a chicken-wire kind of flooring that I never went out on. No. I could see Lynn perfectly outside my window.¬†

I went into work that morning as if nothing had happened. I worked in the deli at Stop & Shop on Washington Street at the time. I wore something similar to a scientist‚Äôs white lab coat, even though I rarely got any stains on it. My hair was short but I still wore one of those plastic hairnets.¬†

I sliced thin flabs of turkey and roast beef for sweet old ladies who watched me as if I was doing the greatest thing in the world. Of course there was a good proportion of customers who eyed me down as if I was the scum of the Earth, but that never bothered me. *Something to know about Matthew Did,* I thought as thin folds fell one by one into my hand; meat on plastic. While those words whispered through my head beneath the sound of the radio-friendly playlist the store had on repeat, I wondered what the old ladies would have thought if they were in that group chat. I imagined if they would gasp.

My lack of worry perplexed me all throughout my shift. I checked my phone when I went on break, and no relatives or friends had sent me alarming text messages, so I figured that my lack of a reaction was some sort of premonition that meant that everything was going to be alright. But then my supervisor came into the breakroom while I was putting my phone away.¬†

Jerry Segnalazione was a chubby and middle aged man with a heart of gold. Some of my fondest memories of working at Stop & Shop were of him and I sitting in the breakroom. He would give me Kitkats sometimes while telling me about his and his son‚Äôs baseball card collection. I had no interest in sports but I gave him my attention. He would share funny stories of other grocery stores he worked at, but I had an inclination that I wasn‚Äôt going to be hearing any funny stories about vagrants smearing their shit on the restroom walls that morning.

‚ÄúJerry.‚Äù I greeted.

‚ÄúMatthew.‚Äù He sounded incredibly cautious. He languidly approached the table I was sitting at and studied my face as if I was an alien in a skinsuit.¬†

He pulled up a chair but didn‚Äôt sit down. He gulped and continued to speak. ‚ÄúI um got an interesting message this morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou did?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù He said, guiding his big body onto the seat as languidly as a boat coming into shore on rough seas. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna be the one to tell you this-‚Äù

‚ÄúI know what it is, Jerry.‚Äù¬†

He looked shocked. All he could do was blink.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he fidgeted in his seat, ‚Äúwhat the hell happened, Matthew?‚Äù He whispered. ‚ÄúWho- who else saw that? I‚Äôm sorry, dude.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything back. I just looked at the table and saw how smooth it was. There was nothing to say so I shrugged.

‚ÄúDo you know who else was in that group chat?‚Äù Jerry went. ‚ÄúI checked. Everybody here. The whole damn staff. The carriage boy had the biggest smirk on his face when he punched in this morning.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt care.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell, Matthew? You know HR is gonna be pulling you in later today, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

I raised my eyebrows, forging a reaction.¬†

Then disappointment came over Jerry‚Äôs face the way you close somebody‚Äôs eyes directly after they died. He struggled out of the chair. ‚ÄúI mean, I didn‚Äôt wanna see that.‚Äù He said without looking into my eyes.

I gulped. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, man.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my problem. Tell that to HR.‚Äù He said underneath his breath, and walked away.¬†

I sat there for the rest of my break wondering why I didn‚Äôt feel guilty, scared or disgusted. A virus had spread, wafting out of the shards of a spilt vial, and I was immune, standing unbothered in the fumes.¬†



That afternoon, after I got fired, I went and picked up a pack of cigarettes on my way home from work. I tried cigars before, hit my friend‚Äôs vape before, but never really took up smoking. I walked around Lynn, sucking on a cigarette like it was a lollipop. Feel something. Feel some grief. All I felt was an empty comfort; a ghostly c‚Äôest la vie.¬†

I passed by gas stations, old brick buildings infested with vines, past hispanic kids playing hopscotch, past some white-trash looking dude playing a guitar, and all I did was suck and suck down the smoke. I felt jittery and at ease, but that was it. I walked around smoking like that for an hour until I got thirsty, so I went back to my apartment and got myself a drink of water.¬†

Still no worried texts from family, just the cold shoulder from my now former co-workers.¬†



I lost my job obviously, and I did apply to others but the search for work fizzled out. I found it more important to walk the streets of Lynn in search of where my bad emotions went. Where my disgust was hiding. Where my self-pity had gone flying off to. Which alleyway my sense of embarrassment was lingering in. I walked past the plastic bags and litter on the street. I wandered down the gaps between buildings and houses like they were mazes too easy to solve. Of course I was smoking the whole time. I became more a part of the city than I had been when I was working at Stop & Shop.¬†

I didn‚Äôt care that I had lost these once uneasing emotions, but a part of me now realized they were important to have, so I kept looking. I walked around as if they were something tangible to find; a runaway cat that you didn‚Äôt like but felt a responsibility for having. I became jittery. I was hungry because I was eating less. I was still eating, yeah, but I wasn‚Äôt eating as healthily as before. I was just spending more of my savings on cigarettes than I was on food.¬†

Another thing, my money was dwindling because I didn‚Äôt have a job anymore. I didn‚Äôt have a new job because finding my sense of‚Ä¶ sense of what exactly? Well, finding whatever that was more important than having a job. A source of feeling, even if it was a negative feeling, seemed much more important than a source of income. I mulled the sextortion situation over in my mind throughout my Lynn excursions, and I still felt no embarrassment or disgust about it. It was whatever. I didn‚Äôt care.¬†

I stopped showering. I stopped brushing my teeth. I stopped changing the sheets on my bed. I cut my own hair because I couldn‚Äôt afford a barber, and I just didn‚Äôt like it getting in front of my eyes.¬†

*Something to know about Matthew Did,* I thought while meandering through Lynn.¬†

I would occasionally check the Stop & Shop parking lot to see if I had left my sense of‚Ä¶ sense of what‚Ä¶¬†

Anyways, I made it a habit of crossing through the Stop & Shop parking lot. Sometimes Jerry would see me and waddle over to me and give me a Kitkat. I think he felt sorry for me.¬†

While stomping behind the grocery store, lurking through the pines around it, I wondered what had exactly caused my eradication of negative emotions. Did seeing the creation of that group chat cause something nuclear and instant to go off in my brain? A shock so great that it made every other disheartening that it made every other disheartening thing of life seem unimportant. I don‚Äôt know.¬†

I think the carriage boy, the boy collecting shopping carts and bringing them back into the store, became scared of me. He would see me, try not to look at me and hurry back into the store. One time one of the other supervisors came out and asked me not to walk around the parking lot unless I was there to buy something. With a mouthful of yellow teeth, I apologized.¬†

So, I started sneaking around at night, looking, searching. One time I even snuck into the store and looked in the bathrooms. No. My old emotions weren‚Äôt in there. They found me shoveling through boxes of pasta down one aisle and threw me out of the store.¬†

Children who were playing outside or walking home from school became scared of me. I could see it in their eyes. *Something to know about Matthew Did.* I didn‚Äôt care. I wasn‚Äôt embarrassed. I wasn‚Äôt ashamed. I walked among them.¬†

Well, I lost the apartment. I wasn‚Äôt able to pay rent anymore. I started bumming and begging for cigarettes, but my breath and odor was a real repellent to people so I rarely ever got a butt from anybody. I still got Kitkats from Jerry. I asked about how his and his son‚Äôs baseball card collection was going but he said he had to get back into the store.¬†

I was becoming a goblin, and I didn‚Äôt care.¬†

One night in an alleyway I caught a rat and ate it. It was still squirming in my hands even after I had dislodged a chunk of its guts from out of its side.¬†

The rats do. I‚Äôm not hungry. I don‚Äôt care. *Something to know about Matthew Did.* Matthew did care. Matthew did not care.

I‚Äôm still in Lynn, bumming around. If you come down to the Stop & Shop on Washington Street in Lynn, Massachusetts, you might see me looking around. Please, don‚Äôt be startled by my appearance. It‚Äôs really nothing. Appearances aren‚Äôt everything after all. Maybe you could help me look.¬†

Anyways, I‚Äôm usually walking through the Stop & Shop parking around 10 before they close. Come. Come see me.¬†

**{A Holly Jolly Diwali by Sonya Lalli} CR, M/F, $4.99 on Amazon and Kobo, may be available on Libby, not on KU, Kobo Plus, Hoopla or Everand.**

>[GoodReads Blurb](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56637919-a-holly-jolly-diwali): Twenty-nine-year-old Niki Randhawa has always made practical decisions. Despite her love for music and art, she became an analyst for the stability. She's always stuck close to home, in case her family needed her. And she's always dated guys that seem good on paper, rather than the ones who give her butterflies. When she's laid off, Niki realizes that practical hasn't exactly paid off for her. So for the first time ever, she throws caution to the wind and books a last-minute flight for her friend Diya's wedding.  Niki arrives in India just in time to celebrate Diwali, the festival of lights, where she meets London musician Sameer Mukherji. Maybe it's the splendor of Mumbai or the magic of the holiday season, but Niki is immediately drawn to Sam. At the wedding, the champagne flows and their flirtatious banter makes it clear that the attraction is mutual.  When Niki and Sam join Diya, her husband and their friends on a group honeymoon, their connection grows deeper. Free-spirited Sam helps Niki get in touch with her passionate and creative side, and with her Indian roots. When she gets a new job offer back home, Niki must decide what she wants out of the next chapter of her life--to cling to the straight and narrow like always, or to take a leap of faith and live the kind of bold life the old Niki never would have dreamed of.

The dutiful daughter of a banking dynasty, she has always done what was expected of her until she falls for her best friend's divorced brother. Attorney turned political strategist Jordan Woolcott has always defined himself by his work. Now at a crossroads, Jordan's not sure who he is, other than a dad to his young son, Mason. It's a rewarding job, but being a single father is so much harder than he'd ever imagined. Vicki has a magical touch when it comes to Mason, and her heart goes out to the overwhelmed Jordan. As feelings grow tender, will an explosive political scandal end their dream of forever before it even begins?

**{Eight Dates by EM Lindsey} CR, MM, $4.99 on Amazon and on KU, not on Kobo or Kobo Plus, not on Hoopla, Everand or Libby.**

>[GoodReads Blurb:](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201926100-eight-dates) Ben Weiss is perfectly fine on his own, thank you very much. After his last failed relationship, he doesn‚Äôt need the drama. But his brother has decided to play matchmaker this year and has set him up with eight blind dates, one for each night of Chanukah. And with eight in a row, there has to be one decent guy in the lot‚Ä¶right? With Ben‚Äôs luck, apparently not. From a date that bites, to one rude to the server, to the guy who brought along his mom, every single one has been a nightmare. Ben‚Äôs ready to give up on love for good, adopt a cat, and call it a day. But there‚Äôs one bright light in Ben‚Äôs week he hasn‚Äôt expected in the form of Nova, the adorable, kind-hearted bartender who‚Äôs come to his rescue every time a date has gone wrong.

She desperately needs space to figure out who she is. Truman Belvedere has just had his heart crushed into a million pieces when he learned that his boyfriend of almost a year has a secret life that includes a husband and a daughter. Reeling from this discovery, all he wants is a place to lick his wounds far, far away from New Orleans. Enter Greta and Truman's mutual friend, Ramona, who facilitates a month-long house swap. Over the winter holidays, each of them will have a chance to try on a new life...and maybe fall in love with the perfect partner of their dreams.

>[GoodReads Blurb](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60547173-lunar-new-love):  Minh has a problem. They've accidentally told their grandmother they'd come with their partner for T·∫øt Holiday - Vietnamese Lunar New Year - this Saturday, and it's too late to take it back. Not only has Minh not been to a family gathering since their disastrous coming out three years ago, they also don't have a partner to show up with. The solution? A fake partner. And of all the people Minh knows, the perfect match turns out to be Cass Beauregard, the one member of their friend group they can't get along with. Cass has a goddamn problem. The day she dumped her cheating boyfriend, she challenged him to an eventual double date to show him just how fast she could find somebody else and how much she didn't need him. But now said double-date is on Sunday and Cass still doesn‚Äôt have a new partner. The solution? Minh Loisel-Tran and their own problem. When they ask her to fake date them for T√™t Holiday, Cass agrees on the one condition that they do the same for her the next day. Minh and Cass are polar opposites: one too soft and the other too brash. There is no way one weekend of fake dating is going to go well... or is there? Minh and Cass might not be as incompatible as they thought. Will this little deal be just a parenthesis in their usual disagreements, or could it lead to something more?

1gvs8zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1gvs8zw/first_timers_trip_report/,First Timers' Trip Report,"Hi, all. My wife and I just returned from our first trip to Paris (actually her second, but she was a kid first time around). Had an incredible experience. The city was everything we hoped for and more. This sub was helpful in our pre-trip planning, so I thought we'd share out impressions.

* Charles de Gaulle is much better than you've read. One experience is not reflective of broader trends, but we landed from the US just after 0900, and were in our pre-arranged car before 1100. On the trip home, we'd read getting through outbound customs can be a slog, so we arrived at CDG at 0715 for an 1145 flight. We were through security and customs before 0800. Seamless. There are a ton of bilingual service agents scattered around, and they are extremely helpful. If we had any complaint, it was getting stuffed onto a bus after landing instead of marching off a jetway, and the lack of food options in terminal 2E. But those issues are minor.
* The French were delightful. We did not have a single less-than-stellar encounter. If you're American, like us, make the effort; meet everyone with *bonjour* or *bonsois.* Use what words you have. Don't expect locals to accommodate you, even though they will. Be gracious. Be kind. Everyone we met was to us.
* Tipping - service industry workers are less intrusive and more professional than many in the US. There's a sense of, I don't know...pride in their work? We left two or three Euro at dinners. There are no POS screens asking if you'd like to leave 25% or 30% for your croissant. We loved that. You will wait a bit longer at cafes, because they care for more tables per server. But who cares? You're in Paris! Watch the world go by and sip your coffee when it comes.
* Scammers/pickpockets - There's so much buzz online about the prevalence of criminality. But having grown up in the bleak New York City of the 1990s, Paris feels no different than Times Square or the Brooklyn Bridge promenade of today. Don't engage any stranger who approaches you. Be alert. Don't look like a victim and you're less likely to become one. I have to think all the concerns expressed in blog posts and on YouTube videos are for people who've not traveled to a major city. Note - we didn't use the Metro, as we preferred to walk. So I can't speak to the underground situation.
* Do not overplan - My wife arranges all our itineraries, and she's extremely efficient. We hit the Eiffel Tower (shockingly impression up close), the Arc de Triomphe (brilliant), a Seine river tour (pleasant, but not a necessity), a day trip to Normandy/Omaha Beach (a must-do for history fans), and the Moulin Rouge show (which was all kinds of crazy). Not a single museum, as they all appeared chaotic. Our favorite moments were walking through the city, turning a corner and stumbling upon a historic building or a beautiful cafe or a trendy little shop. Paris demands exploration. And comfy shoes.
* The food - Spectacular. We didn't have a single bite that wasn't extraordinary. Wine is cheaper than in the States; we came away from even meal feeling we got a great value, and would've certainly paid more at home, even accounting for the exchange rate. Also, the all-in pricing is brilliant; taxes are built in.
* The G7 Taxi app - this never let us down. Licensed cabs are more regimented than Ubers, and can use bus lanes where rideshares cannot. The app is a bit glitchy, but we always got where we needed to be on time.

I could go on. The city is incredible. The people were, too. There are few places I'd want to return to again and again. Paris is one of them.",9,1732117005.0,ParisTravelGuide,2,1.0,False

Waking up in recovery was very hard-lots of pain. Went home and took an hour nap and was much better after that. This morning the gas pain in my shoulder is pretty bad and there‚Äôs some pain where my gallbladder used to be. Not anything really debilitating.

Anesthesia makes me nauseous so they pushed Zofran and gave me a scopolamine patch. This morning I‚Äôm having nausea so they called in Zofran. I know that will help. The patch has also really dried my mouth. Yuck.

Last night I ate a little chicken soup and tolerated it well. I had some coffee and tea this morning which also went fine. 

I‚Äôm trying to get up and move around. That seems to really help with the gas pain. Also took Gas X and Pepcid hoping that might help as well.

I am not having any pain at the incision sites.

Things I have for post op-heating pad, large ice pack. When I feel like eating again, I have chicken noodle soup, saltines, bananas. For drinks-water, ginger ale, mint tea.

Notes are your friend. Personally I've taken to keeping multiple thick spiral notebooks around tables/desks/coffee tables and just jotting down anything I'm thinking/discussing/doing at work. What always gets me to stop doing notes is getting overly focused on doing them ""right"", but I've started reminding myself that they're for my own reference, to remind me of what I was thinking at the time of writing it. Even if I'm not writing down ""new"" information (like I'm jotting down a note I THINK I'll remember/know later, which is often untrue but I can't convince myself of it in the moment), often times reading it again will remind me of more details that I forgot about. 

Some more examples of random notes coming in handy for my ADHD workday:

- Noting a question mid-meeting that wasn't worth interrupting for, but that I'd like the answer to. 

- Writing out the logic in a bugged feature with a diagram explaining how it's supposed to function (this especially comes in handy when working on something in multiple settings)

- Jotting down anything I verbally say I'll do, even if I'm so sure I'll do it right away (this just helps keep me relaxed because I can be confident I'm NOT missing anything, and can be more certain when I DIDN'T say I'd do something)

- Noting what coworkers are doing that may be relevant or generally work I'd like to keep track of. 

I tend to worry about organizing my notes and it's definitely something I struggle with, but at the moment just writing down the date at the top of the page is fine for me. Then I can reference the days I was likely doing something vs the pages around those days and I can usually find whatever note I'm looking for. ",3,1732116756.0,ADHD_Programmers,0,0.8,False

**Chapter 1**

**The Joker and the Fool**

Greetings, I am Special Agent Michelle Harris, and I work for a relatively unknown agency called the Department of Paranormal Investigation, or DPI for short. I explained the odd particulars regarding my agency in my investigative report, labeled [File #177: The Story of Emma Summers.](https://www.reddit.com/u/RingoCross99/s/dQZcFbLVoD) Also, a short summary of my background, education, and overall experience can be found there.

This is another one of those reports I felt compelled to complete for various reasons. All too often, cases like this get buried in the archives and are forever lost to the hands of time and indifference. I hope to bring at least a modicum of peace and justice to their memory. Solace and clarity are the only two things that seem to ease the weight that burdens my conscience.

In my earlier file, I delved into the innerworkings of my department when it comes to handling cases. I fear my prior, more informal explanation may have failed to shed sufficient light. I feel it is important to illuminate the reasons why I do these reports outside of their obvious cathartic nature. So please, bear with me. The terminology may be a bit disorienting. But I will do my utmost to keep my explanation terse.

First, I am assigned to the case by my immediate supervisor, who is called a field coordinator. Then my partner and I take some time to look over the files and determine a course of action.

We are assigned to a case for one of three reasons. Number 1: They are part of a project or experiment. Number 2: A resource specialist flagged a civilian occurrence as a PEP. And lastly: the case was directly assigned to us by the abstruse ‚ÄúBoard of Trustees.‚Äù

As a DPI agent it is my primary duty to identify if the case under investigation is paranormal in nature. If it is then it must be assigned a PLI, which is short for proper level of inquest.

There are two major codes: VPE and EOE. A PLI is accomplished by completing a ‚Äúfinal report‚Äù and attaching a file number if it is a VPE, or an all-important dossier number if it is an EOE.

These reports are completed by us if they are the latter and a source agent if they are the former. If a case is considered a high enough threat to national security, it is forwarded over to the Board of Trustees for further examination. The trustees will take a vote, and if it passes, the files are handed over directly to the White House. This is when our observational report is possibly turned into a military operation by OSS.

The EOE tag is needed for any report to be taken seriously by the higherups. It is so crucial that getting it wrong could lead to a permanent strike on an agent‚Äôs disciplinary record. If a case is indeed considered EOE, it is our job to understand the phenomenon behind the occurrence or disturbance. I do not want to overload my report with DPI jargon, so I‚Äôll end here.

The case in question, CR-File #184. Please, bear with me for another moment. I know I just promised not to cram my examination full of technical bits, but I need to explain why I do these reports specifically.

VPE Cases like #184 are not considered a priority. They are ‚Äúunofficial reports‚Äù in essence, meaning they are paranormal in nature, but not EOEs. Cases of this lesser magnitude are the most common according to the SOP. Usually, we hand over our initial report, called a CIR, or criminal investigative report, to a source agent, and they convert our CIR into a criminal report file, or CRF for short. These ‚Äúfinal reports‚Äù are given a three-digit file number and stored under the ‚Äúnonessential‚Äù category in our complete archival report folder, or CAR for short.

I must emphasize how rare it is for a special agent to complete their own final report. And for this reason, I am secretly ridiculed by my superiors for being too endearing. It doesn‚Äôt bother me. I made a promise to myself that I would never forget the human aspect of every case, no matter how dark. In many ways, it‚Äôs the only thing that brings me back whenever I feel astray.

I‚Äôve seen a lot in my short tenure at the department. Most of the things can be easily explained, rationalized, or compartmentalized away. But there are a few cases that have been difficult for me to slip neatly into a folder and lock away inside of my mental file cabinet.

What‚Äôs odd is that it‚Äôs always the nonessential cases I lose the most sleep over. It‚Äôs not like these cases stand out for their brutality or injustice, especially when compared to their EOE counterparts.

You‚Äôd think with a bachelor‚Äôs in psychology I could unpack my own emotions. Perhaps one day I‚Äôll sit down on my own proverbial couch and spend the evening psychoanalyzing myself instead of all these supernatural beings. Though, I doubt this wonderful idea will ever come to fruition. Considering, I barely have enough time to do anything meaningful outside of work. As you can imagine, a job like this demands the bulk of my attention.

Now to the case in question. CR-File #184. It all began with a man named John Lucas Henry. He had been suspected of killing his entire family in a fit of paranoid psychosis. Initial intel didn‚Äôt give us much to go on. He didn‚Äôt deny slaughtering his family. His reason was that the voice inside his head made him do it.

Ah. If I had a nickel for every time I heard that line, I‚Äôd have a jar full of them by now. Ok. Maybe not a jar, but you get the idea. Forgive my unabashed skepticism, but in my professional opinion, ‚Äúthe voices in my head made me do it‚Äù was the typical excuse suspects used when trying to avoid criminal responsibility.

It is true I work for an agency that investigates paranormal occurrences. Believe me the irony is not missed, nor the hint of injustice provided by my incredulity. The fact remains, no one in our department takes this criminal justification seriously. It always falls flat when scrutinized by any agent worth his or her badge.

Though the excuse may be banal and a bit cheeky, the psychology is fascinating. I suppose this would make sense coming from someone who is obsessed with the human mind and what makes us tick. For as long as I can remember, well before I chose to pursue a degree in psychology, and right after the situation with my sister, I often found myself pondering the merits of dualism and immaterialism.

My thesis explored the true meaning of consciousness as well as why so many of us view the brain and soul as separate experiences connected by one source‚Äîthe body. The last section of my conclusion paragraph went like this: ‚ÄúI am convinced that I possess a soul. And when I die, I will be judged for my sins unlike machine intelligence. Thus, I can say with supreme confidence that no matter how futuristic or evolved artificial intelligence becomes, it will never possess a soul. A machine is cold and objective. The human experience is warm and subjective. Take away our subjectivity and we lose our humanity. Make no mistake about it: AI is Intelligent, and it would be foolish to argue otherwise. Intelligence is a part of their designate, but AI is *not* sapient. This rare distinction belongs to the only surviving member of the human species, Homo sapiens.‚Äù

As you can imagine, the conclusion to my thesis was considered controversial in some psychological circles while simultaneously being lauded in certain theological circles. The notoriety is probably what put me on DPI‚Äôs radar when I think back, but who knows.

The reason my thesis caused a stir was because of the Astonishing Hypothesis, which was a book written by Dr. Francis Crick. In the book she argued many things. Too many to explain in my report. The crude-gist of her work states that we are in fact nothing but a bunch of neurons, and it is these very same neurons that create what we assume to be consciousness and subjective experience. This is of course a gross paraphrasing of her work, even still, much of what she says in her book has been backed up by cognitive psychology and neuroscience.

I am not writing this report to sway anyone‚Äôs ethics or further the debate between dualism and monism. I am merely divulging what motivated me to pursue my studies. In truth, I‚Äôve always had a passion for understanding the innerworkings of the mind. Speaking of which, the case in question, file #184, is an interesting one. What I thought to be a textbook example of severe dissociative identity disorder turned out to be something far more sinister.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our story begins at the Detroit Metro Airport on July 16, 2019. When we arrived, we were immediately hit with our first obstacle. Somehow there had been a mix-up with our seats. Instead of being assigned to business class, we had been assigned to economy.

I found this a bit irritating, but things happen. My partner, the always irritable Agent Adams, wasn‚Äôt having it. Seeing his reaction, I tried to calm him, even going so far as to offer him the window seat. He scoffed at my proposition, turned to the clerk, and informed her that we were government agents on duty.

The clerk shrugged, apologized profusely, and told my partner there was nothing she could do. She said it in as polite a tone as possible, which only irritated my partner even more. He hated it when people were being overly nice to him. Me trying to play mediator, I asked if she could book us first class seats for the following flight that just so happened to be in a few hours.

The compromise was enough to get him off her back. He turned his fury on HQ. First, dialing up our supervisor and laying into him pretty thick. This surprised me. For some reason I thought he was calling to inform him that we were going to be late due to a mix-up with our flight. Then after abruptly ending that call, he went after his next target. He dialed up the resource department and cursed their supervisor for assigning us to a case in rural Georgia in the middle of summer.

I remember sighing and telling myself to get mentally prepared for a long trip. Now that I think back on it, I remember how baffled I was by his odd conduct during our first few cases together. I was the agency‚Äôs first female graduate from the DPI Field Investigations Unit. As you can imagine, I had studied incredibly hard to earn my badge. I graduated with high marks and did everything by the book. It‚Äôs funny now, but at the time, working with Gary had been something of a cultural shock.

I had been assigned to work with him by the Board for reasons that are still unknown. Their decision caused something of a stir and is considered unprecedented. The story behind our first encounter is interesting to say the least. I‚Äôll elaborate one day, but for now, it‚Äôs safe to say, I was put into a situation that nearly killed me.

Ah. Those are some fond memories. I admit I‚Äôve learned quite a bit about the supernatural. A lot more than I would have if I was working with anyone else. One of the most important lessons he‚Äôs inadvertently taught me was to always judge a book by its cover. Strange, I know‚Äîit‚Äôs nothing he‚Äôs ever come out and said in one of his many, less than witty moments; it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve noticed. That‚Äôs all. I say this because out of the five years we‚Äôve worked together, I can count on one hand how many times I‚Äôve seen him fazed under pressure.

Our destination was the city of Butler. I have no clue why places like this were called ‚Äúcity.‚Äù It was located in one of the more rural areas of Georgia and was the ‚Äúcounty seat‚Äù for Taylor County. I already knew it was going to be a long drive. My partner was still cranky from the flight and told me that since I was the junior agent, it was my duty to chauffeur him around. Knowing the operations manual like the back of my hand, I insisted that his claim wasn‚Äôt true. When I said this, he shrugged and said he was still groggy from the sleeping pill he took during the flight.

Before I could argue, he hopped into the backseat, slipped on his sleeping mask, and stretched out with the travel pillow he always brought with him. In truth, I didn‚Äôt really mind. He had been a total baby thus far. I could use the peace and quiet to think.

Before he drifted off to sleep, I remember commenting how, ‚ÄúIf he somehow made it to Heaven, he would get booted for complaining that it was too sunny.‚Äù

He found my joke clever and replied with, ‚ÄúBah! Start driving already. And turn the AC on so I can get out of this hellish heat. Sending me out to the sticks in the dead of summer to chase ghosts! Wait until we get back to HQ, I‚Äôm going to file a giant grievance!‚Äù

I agreed with his assessment of the case and said as much, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised the resource department flagged it. I‚Äôm sure this will be a textbook nonparanormal.‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember, Michelle, don‚Äôt try to solve the case. We‚Äôre not detectives. You‚Äôll burn yourself out trying to be a hero. I don‚Äôt know how many times I have to say it. Our job is to give people enough rope to hang themselves. If you do that the case will solve itself.‚Äù

I thought about what he said during the drive. It didn‚Äôt make sense. But then again, the things he said hardly ever made sense. After dismissing his comment, as the ramblings of a miserable man, I listened to a self-help podcast for about thirty minutes. After that, I sank my teeth into a lengthy audio recording I made the other night, detailing everything we knew about the case.

For the most part, I did a lot of thinking. I thought about my career and if I should put it on hold to pursue my postgraduate. I doubted it. But then again you never know. I know one thing for sure. My job had been taking a toll on me. It's like they were waiting for me to finish my training. I was assigned to work with Agent Adams straight away and have been going nonstop ever since.

Another part of it was the work itself. The things I‚Äôve learned have stretched my moral fibers beyond imagination. It‚Äôs shocking to know who really runs the world, how they operate, and that there isn‚Äôt much we can do to stop them, other than create an ‚Äúobservation department,‚Äù as the vampires love to call us. I grew up in a very religious home. I‚Äôve always known God was real, even before my career. My faith was the only reason I went into psychology instead of psychiatry.

Another thing that bothered me was verifying the existence of God. Oh, and I don‚Äôt mean just any old God. I mean God in the biblical Christian context. That‚Äôs right. He exists in all of his glory and grandeur just as described. And yet... and yet he hardly intervenes... I, I can‚Äôt tell you how much this bothers me... \*sighs\*

The reason he leaves us to our own devices is because of what the angels call his ‚ÄúAlmighty Holy Decree on Freewill.‚Äù The whole ‚Äúfree will‚Äù versus ‚Äúdivine will‚Äù controversy or dispute, depending on which scholar or entity you ask, is crucial to the angelic schism, and eventually led to the Great Heavenly Rebellion.

I suppose you could say it was the first doctoral dispute. Amazingly, the issue of free will is still a hot topic within the Holy Order. The rebellion did little to change that. When I first learned this, I was so surprised it took me a few weeks to really digest the implications. I always believed that the biblical story pertaining to God and Satan was a neat little story about good and evil, but it‚Äôs a bit trickier than that.

Ahhh, the ‚ÄúHoly Order...‚Äù I‚Äôve mentioned the name a few times. Huh. Where would I even begin? I suppose with their mission. Nah. Too complicated... Put it this way: they‚Äôre the angelic governing and organizational body for all the angels stationed on Earth. There‚Äôs a lot more to it, but this is the short answer.

During the drive I also thought about my family. Based on divine doctrine, I believe my sister‚Äôs soul is one of the many unfortunate ones trapped in a place she was never meant to be. The idea of hell had become personal. A little piece of suffering I could call my own. God could be downright cruel sometimes. But rules are rules I suppose. Knowing this made me feel hopeless and sick to my stomach. The pain I had buried when we buried my sister was beginning to resurface. Just then my phone rang.

Speaking of family and inescapable sorrow, it was my father. With that in mind, I took a deep breath before finally deciding to answer:

‚ÄúHi, dad.‚Äù

‚ÄúHello, Ladybug.‚Äù

‚ÄúPah. I‚Äôm not twelve.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know... I know...‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd know if you answered my calls.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry. I‚Äôve been busy with work.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no excuse for not talking to your father for a whole year.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. That‚Äôs not why I called.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not in trouble, are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am. But there‚Äôs nothing you can do.‚Äù

‚ÄúTch. Does this have anything to do with your drinking?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what they say. You know doctors, always trying to play God.‚Äù

It took me a second to gather my thoughts. The thought of him... it was... it was too grim a thought. ‚ÄúAs soon as this case is over, I‚Äôll come visit you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMeh. You act like I‚Äôm dying. Your mother is the one you should be worried about.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, please. Not this.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen was the last time you talked to her?‚Äù

‚ÄúDad. Come on.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long is she going to walk around in that imaginary world of hers, pretending Ash is still alive? You know I... I didn‚Äôt want to leave her. You know that, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. Believe me, I. I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúHell. You‚Äôre the psychologist. You tell me what‚Äôs wrong with the bugger.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad. Please. I‚Äôm not a psychologist. And even if I were, now‚Äôs not the‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThen when is? Why‚Äôs it okay for everyone to drag my name through the mud for leaving the crazy hag, but it‚Äôs okay for her to drive our family apart! Ash was just as much my daughter as she was your mother‚Äôs. You were seventeen! You were there when it happened! You saw how she blamed me! Hell, she still blames me! You wouldn‚Äôt know because you got out of there and did right by yourself with college and now this cushy government gig.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, I understand. I know how‚Äî‚Äù

*‚ÄúNo!* No, you don‚Äôt know ‚Äòhow I feel!‚Äô So don‚Äôt bother with it. I‚Äôll tell you alright. Imagine living with someone who won‚Äôt let go of that kind of pain! I loved Ash just as much damnit! Look... Look, I‚Äôm sorry for leaving your mother, okay? I-I couldn‚Äôt keep living like that‚Äîbeing reminded of your sister day and night, thanks to her batty ways. She still makes her bed, you know. Washes the same tired, old school uniforms. Talks as if Ash is due home any morning now. Now you tell me, who wants to live like that? Huh? Gah. No wonder I turned to the bloody bottle.‚Äù

He stopped ranting and began sobbing like mad when the pain had finally breached his defenses. It was a guttural cry that was very difficult to listen to. I could feel my own eyes well up, but I had to stay strong. I had to for him and for my own sanity.

‚ÄúBloody hell. Sorry, Ladybug. I just wish everything could go back to normal.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too, dad.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou two were close, hey?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Very.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm at the pub.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, you really need to stop drinking.‚Äù

‚ÄúMother Mary...‚Äù he muttered under his breath. I could hear the empty shot glass rattle when he slammed it down on the table and demanded another round. He made a scene about it, using our call as an excuse. He drunkenly proclaimed to the whole bar that he had found his long-lost daughter before shamefully downing another shot.

‚ÄúDad. You really need to knock it off.‚Äù

‚ÄúEh. So, what do you think, doc?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù

‚ÄúAm I as screwy as your mother? I reckon you think I have just as many nuts and bolts rattling around as that old tinker,‚Äù he said before cackling.

‚ÄúI have to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry for my behavior.‚Äù

‚ÄúI understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúKeep making us proud.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoodbye, dad.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoodbye, Ladybug.‚Äù

I ended the call and sighed. I remember looking back to make sure Adams was still asleep. I don‚Äôt know why that was my first mind, I thought as I fought back the tears. I suppose it‚Äôs what I deserve. I had been avoiding my parents for a while now. For the longest I viewed their behavior as a distraction. I made a mental note to visit him and... and maybe even mother... After that, I pretty much blocked out the whole conversation and bravely carried on giving this investigation my full attention.

**Chapter 2**

**Southern Hospitality**

We arrived at the Taylor County Jail at approximately 0800 hours on the following day (July 17, 2019). It was a brand-new jailhouse that was located right across from the old one. Only reason I knew this was because I foolishly went there first, only to be met by a bunch of rusted yard equipment, inside of what was now a makeshift storehouse. Across the way was a set of railroad tracks that stretched endlessly in both directions.

Ah, the good old city of Butler. There wasn‚Äôt much to say about it other than it was just like any other small town. Quiet and quaint; the townsfolk were extremely nice but a little too nosey. I wanted to see the courthouse, but my partner frowned upon the idea. And so, we entered the jailhouse and made our way over to the clerk.

I informed him who we were, and that the sheriff was expecting us. He promptly called for him over the two-way. There was a fair bit of radio chatter between them. He apologized for the confusion and asked that we sit tight. Apparently, the atmosphere around town had been tense, but he promised that the sheriff was on his way.

Agent Adams scoffed at the comment before grumbling that he was going outside to vape. Before leaving, he made a snide remark about how annoying it was having to wait. He sneered when I informed him that perhaps this was karma, giving him a taste of his own medicine.

I remained inside and exchanged a fair bit of small talk with the young clerk. I learned a bit more about him and the case. From what I gathered, he loved his softball league, hated the fact that he came third in the annual chili cookoff, and thought all the fuss over Mr. Henry‚Äôs case was unwarranted. I agreed with his last sentiment and told him that the sheriff probably pulled a few strings to get the case handed over to the FBI.

I didn‚Äôt tell him this of course, but we receive a significant amount of our cases from the FBI and CIA. Especially the latter, so much so, we call them ‚Äúlegacy cases‚Äù because they‚Äôre partly to blame for my agency‚Äôs existence in the first place.

Being that this was a rural area, Mr. Henry‚Äôs behavior and alleged crimes had stirred up a hornet‚Äôs nest. These were good, honest townsfolk, who believed that God and hard work were the cure for everything. Nobody could wrap their head around the fact that it was one of their own and not some sleazy ne‚Äôer-do-well from the big city who had committed the ultimate act of evil.

My opinion of the case was that this was a classic example of ‚Äúthe devil made me do it.‚Äù Technically speaking the devil cannot make anyone do anything. There are a few technicalities, but suffice to say, we rarely investigate ‚Äúthe devil made me do it‚Äù crimes because of this. At the department we call these archetypal cases ‚Äúcrying wolf.‚Äù

The sheriff arrived before we could sink too deep into conversation. When I looked over, I saw him shaking Agent Adams‚Äô hand. He made a colorful comment about the weather as they made their way inside. His offhanded remark got a slight chuckle out of my partner.

He walked over and introduced himself as Sheriff Russell Giles Junior. When I asked what I should call him, he said, ‚ÄúEverybody calls me Russ.‚Äù

We chatted in the lobby for a while longer. This was due to us having to wait for his deputies to secure John Henry before he could be moved into the interrogation room. The sheriff offered to take us to see the Ward Edwards Museum later that day. In his words, it was the world‚Äôs largest outdoor museum. A claim which cannot be refuted since we failed to take him up on his offer. He also gave us a few pointers regarding places to eat. Apparently, the China Wok restaurant was all the rave, and Ms Betty‚Äôs Fried Chicken was one of a kind, especially the fries. He also told us more about the courthouse.

‚ÄúEveryone visits the courthouse,‚Äù the clerk threw in, which got a nod and chuckle out of the sheriff.

I told him we tried the local coffee shop, but it wasn‚Äôt open.

The clerk laughed and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never open.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù I inquired.

‚ÄúTheir boy‚Äôs sick,‚Äù he answered.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nonsense, Ernie. Now stop putting bad rumors on honest folk. Ain‚Äôt nothing wrong with their boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, boss,‚Äù he meekly replied.",0,1732116522.0,nosleep,1,0.5,False

I am LF a female friend to go on Dates with. It would typically be during the weekdays with the occasional weekend. Things like coffee and a walk in the park, cooking class, orchards, breweries, and plays. I need an emotional connection before I will get physical and not every time that we hang out will or must be physical. I am more than happy to hang out with you the person rather than the orifice. (That was supposed to be funny) Dates would be Dutch unless either party specifies, and I would prefer somewhere in between where we both live. 

If/When things get physical, I am a very giving partner. I tend to focus on my partner rather than myself. My pleasure is appreciated, but I get off on you getting off. I don't have a size preference in women, I love all types, but prefer thick girls, but that doesn't disqualify anyone. Again, Personality over Physical. 

I ask that you are A) Clean - both sexually and otherwise. Washes their pits and teeth! Lol you'd be surprised. B) Non-smoker - I'm allergic to chemicals in cigarettes and an epi-pen situation doesn't make for a good date. C) Between the ages of 26 and 55. Age divided by 2 plus 6 for starting age. Age divided by 2, plus your age for ceiling, thems the rules. Idk if you drink, so long as you aren't an alcoholic, and I am 420 friendly.

Ideal date after we've known each other for a while: we go out to dinner, have great conversation, and feel the vibe. We come back to mine or yours and I spend the next few hours wearing your thighs as ear muffs. (I LOVE giving oral.)

I get tested every quarter and expect the same if we aren't exclusive. I don't play without condoms. 

I can host as well.



Ok here's the other shoe, so to speak lol:

I am happily married for over 8yrs, together for 10yrs. She and I practice ENM and have been for 2yrs now. She and I play separately, she has her partners and I have mine. I only ever have one partner at a time. No particular reason just the way I do things. I just don't like to divide my attention too much. Yes, she knows that I'm on here and asking. Yes, you can ask her or meet her whenever you wish once we get to know each other better. No need to bother her if it isn't going to work out. My wife and I are emotionally monogamous, meaning that I will care for you deeply, but it shall be as a friend.

What do you get out of it?
A safe and sane partner, who doesn't pressure you and respects boundaries. I am very communicative both in and out of the bedroom. Someone who can and will explore things we're both into even if I haven't tried it before, like Ethiopian food - I wanna try it, but haven't had the opportunity. Someone who texts you back when you text, someone who actually gives a shit what happens in your day.
If you live close to me, then I offer the service of drive-by kisses, so that even if we can't hang out that day then at least I got to kiss you that day. (They are super fun!) I don't care about your sexual experience, if any, as I said I am very patient and willing to progress at your speed.

What if I find someone, while we are together?
We can end what we have or we can continue, so long as the other person knows. I won't be a side-piece! I will respect you and expect the same. I recognize that every person offers a different type of emotional energy and that no one person can or should be expected to meet that standard. To me that's unrealistic and unfair to them.

Best case scenario - I'd like something consistent, like a least a year or more (dating is exhausting); however, I am open to shorter scenarios.

Not interested in ONS.

CN has claimed he has always hadto! work this much and that we ""needed the money."" Are there times we needed the money? Sure. Has he/have we ""needed the money"" for 37 years straight? No. Aside from that, the man has been salaried for some time now, and he does not make an extra dime by working the 70+ hours a week he claims he hasto!

It's taken me a lot of time and therapy to get there, but I finally realize that his addiction to work is so he can avoid having a life. He works all the time and white-knights lonely, needy, vulnerable single moms at work so he can avoid romantic relationships and friendships.¬†

The only ""friendship"" he has is with his sister. For her, he will drop everything, text the day away, call her (though he claims to hate talking on the phone), go on weekly dinner dates with her until 2 am, plan vacations alone together, etc.¬†

I spent my whole marriage never telling anyone about his extreme level of absence, neglect, lack of touch, sex, and refusal to be a partner, ignoring my son, all while he obsessed over women at work and his sister. I really thought it was my fault and that I was expecting too much. But I now know I wasn't even expecting the bare minimum.¬†

I have realized a key thing during the last year: If he wanted to, he would.¬†

He COULD text me once during his 15-hour-long workdays. He COULD return a text. He COULD come home from work on time. He COULD come home by midnight after his dinner dates with his sister, instead of 2 am. He COULD touch me, have sex, sleep in the same bed, share a bank account, and more. He chooses not to.¬†

During the last week, I have even more proof that he makes time for things he wants, and I am to gratefully accept his scraps, if that.¬†

Last week, his former coworker who was fired for theft wanted to meet for coffee. CN was somehow able to drop everything in the middle of the workday and meet the guy for over three hours. CN constantly tells me how busy he is at work, how he has no time, he's behind, he can't possibly return a text, he never sees texts from me because he is so incredibly busy, etc.¬†

Then this week, at the last moment, he somehow has the ability to meet one of his coworkers for a 3-hour-long breakfast. I checked his location, and he's still there.¬†

I now know he'll make time for the things he wants. Hanging out with his sister all night, but then blaming me for the fact he had ""no time"" for the gym. Last-minute coffee/dinner meetings with coworkers. Time off to ""help"" his sister, but he looks aghast if I ask him to take a day off and give him half a year's notice.¬†

It's ridiculous. If they wanted to, they would. I'll remember that.¬†",3,1732116180.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

1gvrwmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gvrwmz/why_do_i_nap_2_hours_a_day/,Why do I nap 2 hours a day ,"Now I know, many people say just stay awake or drink coffee, but this issue has been going on for about 5 years and has not been that simple.  I am a 24M and have been having these issues since the age of 20.  I currently work as a homeless advocate and get home from work everyday at 5pm, eat and then feel an uncontrollable tiredness that causes me to go take a 1.5 to 2 hour nap.  I then proceed to wake up and then go to the gym (5 times a week), come back home, relax, drink tea and go to bed by 11:00pm.  

Background:  I am not diagnosed with any chronic health or physical health conditions, however I do have some mental health issues that cause me to take these medications. If knowing the doses and length I‚Äôve been taking them would help, let me know and I can provide that info‚Ä¶ Depakote (night), Ambien (night), Prozac (morning) and focalin (morning).  I also take a Zyrtec daily due to allergies, which I originally took in the morning but switched to the night to see if there was a difference and there was none.  These medications are all prescribed within the past year, so I can eliminate them as being the cause.  I also have gone to my primary who got bloodwork to check my thyroid and other endocrine factors and nothing showed up.  

I drink the recommended amount of water in a given day, maybe more due to my physical activity and maintain a healthy diet, with occasional cheating because I like pizza and such. I attend the gym 5 to 6 days a week depending on soreness and have for 5 years.  I am 5‚Äô9 and 186lbs and in good physical shape.  I also do not experience any other symptoms that make me lean one specific way regarding this issue.  My stress is limited from work and my life outside of work is relatively normal/stress free.  

As for sleeping at night, you can ascertain that I take ambien for sleep, and am able to sleep for 8 to 9 hours of good sleep.  I also do not snore, nor am restless in my sleep according to my partner of over a year 

My theories: 

Because this issue has been going on for so long, I myself have gathered theories about what the cause may be‚Ä¶

Vitamin Deficiency:  I have in the past taken vitamin B12 and D3 in the winter time to combat seasonal depression and it had limited affect on my sleeping habits.  I am not that well versed in the vitamin sphere, so maybe there is a deficiency I do not know of, but B and D are the two most common I see suggested for similar issues.  

Diet:  while my diet is good, I do eat low carbohydrates for my lunch meal prep, about a half cup of rice, 6 ounces of chicken and healthy amount of vegetables.  My thought with this is that my body is not getting the fuel it needs from carbs to function at a high consistent level.  However, I have experienced my body without any carbohydrates and experienced other symptoms that are not present at this time.  

Caffeine:  I am what someone might call a person who loves coffee. I drink between 2 to 3 cups of coffee a day, down from the days of 5 to 6 from 5 years ago.  I also consume a powdered pre workout drink before my workout, which is affected if I do not nap and seemingly does not work if I do not take that post work snoozer. 

Sunlight:  I live in upstate New York and am currently in an apartment with low natural light, but came from a residence of the past year that had a lot of natural light which did not affect this issue.

Medications:  Now despite not equaling the timeline of the issue, another cause of this issue may be related to my use of ambien, which I am looking to come off of in the new year.  My theory is that my ambien is putting me to sleep instead of my body naturally falling asleep and winding down and my naps are the opportunities in which my body naturally falls asleep instead of being medicated sleep.  

Waking up poorly:  my last theory revolves around waking up.  I have three alarms set for my day to begin throughout the work week: 700am, 730am and 745am.  I never am able to get up until the last despite wanting to get in the habit of waking up earlier. I have been recommended a sunlight alarm clock by my psychiatrist to naturally wake up to make the process smoother and increase my sunlight intake.  

I appreciate any and all advice or suggestions or solutions you may have.  This issue is not life threatening or a major condition that I know of, but instead is a long standing issue that I wish to get some headway on as I look to better myself as an individual.",1,1732116109.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I have always had a good relationship with my in-laws and in particular my sister in law. She was my bridesmaid and we have always been pretty close, meeting up for walks, hikes, coffee etc etc. She was the first person that actually knew we were TTC long before it became a problem, she knew maybe 3/4 months into our journey. During the first 3 years of TTC we spoke countless times about it and how it affected me and she had directly asked me before how I‚Äôve been coping etc. 
I always felt she was someone I could go to. She‚Äôs had a few difficult relationships and after coming out of a toxic relationship a couple of years ago (which involved the police etc and I supported her through this) decided to go travelling. In Jan 2024 she was leaving for 9/10 months of continuous travel and wouldn‚Äôt be home during this time. 
I was due to start my second round of IVF in January (cancelled cycle in August 2023 due to OHSS) and when I saw her over Christmas (before she left) she asked about it and made a comment that she would be thinking of me over the next couple of weeks. 
This second cycle was cancelled again due to over stimulation  (which was an extremely physically and emotionally challenging experience for me). I was in a really bad place for a couple of months and had taken time off work. When I returned to work in March/April time I was in a better place,  I sort of realised at that point I hadn‚Äôt heard from her at all, even though she knew I was starting another round days after she had left to go travelling. I genuinely brushed it off and put it down to a fast paced lifestyle travelling, time difference etc etc. However I started to feel hurt and annoyed when I realised that she was in daily contact with her mum and sister and realised contact back home wasn‚Äôt an issue. I started another cycle in April/May (got through it with embryos to freeze) and had a failed transfer in September. 
This year has been the most difficult and challenging year of my life and I‚Äôve just felt extremely hurt that someone who I had regular contact with throughout my TTC journey for the previous 2/3 years just never even text once even in a general capacity. I get that people could say I never reached out to her and I get that but, for the first 3/4 months of this year I feel I was at rock bottom and shut myself off, when I came around and realised there was no contact with her I was too far gone at that stage and was really annoyed. 
When she returned from her travels in October 2024 it was no later than 48hours being back home that she basically text me inviting me out to the cinema and a walk - as if attempting to pick up where we left off. I was shell shocked if I‚Äôm honest, I feel like I have been through the wars this past year and she wants to resume our routine as if Ive been fine all this time and nothings happened. I brushed it off and haven‚Äôt spoke much since. There‚Äôs been birthdays etc and it‚Äôs just been plain dry message exchanges. On top of it all, their other sister announced she was expecting twins a week after our failed transfer (his parents know our entire journey and was aware of this announcement coming) so as you can imagine, I am in a position where I just want to shut myself off from my husbands family. 

I just want honest opinions and advice because I feel like I‚Äôm falling into a massive pit of bitterness and negativity and for my husband‚Äôs sake I don‚Äôt want things to sour any further. 

Does anyone even have any book or podcast recommendations about managing resentment and bitterness during this journey ü©∑",1,1732116100.0,InfertilitySucks,4,1.0,False

To explain a bit before starting the story. If you are bothered by gay things i rather you not to read this. Yes i‚Äôm a trans male (no operation done yet), under testosterone since 3rd of june(5months and 17 days) For the purpose of the story i‚Äôm going to call my date, Nathan for anonyma and because it‚Äôs simple. He already dated trans guys i‚Äôm not the first one.

So the story begins when me and my ex broke up, it was a toxic relationship that lasted two whole years. He finally broke up with me but wanted to take me back and i said no. (Keep this in mind it will be extremly important.) After a few weeks, my mom told me to download a dating app because she said that‚Äôs how she met her current boyfriend. I don‚Äôt like dating app usually but it was the time to test it out. So i download the app, make my profil and look through a few profile. A few cute girls and handsome man but nothing more interesting. I got a few matches talking a bit but nothing came out great until i met Nathan. I saw Nathan‚Äôs profil but i thought he was straight because he didn't have any sexual prepference on his profil so i passed on it when a few days later. He sent me a match, i was suprised and accepted it. He match the small icon where i said ‚Äòyou will like me if you like : videos games, movie nights or music (mostly any types)'. He send a message saying ‚Äòhey, i love you hair handsome‚Äô. First of all i blushed hard and I was glad a man like him will be interested in a trans guy like me. So we started chatting together, smiling, flirting, he was rizzing me all the time before i could. Making cute comments and compliments. We talked a lot about everything and anything, he sended me a lot of memes since he is a shitposter which i clearly don‚Äôt mind. Then a few days later, we were on a late night call between 00:00 and 4:00 a.m. he told me where he was living but it didn‚Äôt match his current profil and this conversation begins.

Me : on your profil it says that you live in #### did you moved you to live un &&&&?

Nathan : no i‚Äôm just currently at my parents for the holydays but i will go back to #### tomorrow

Me : oh do you pass by the highway near ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨?

Nathan : yeah i do actually why?

Me : my city is a few exit away maybe like 45 minute after ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨ on the same highway

Nathan : really ? Maybe we could set something..

Me : oh i mean definitly.. wanna meet up at a bar in my city? For a coffee?

Nathan : yeah sure.. why not sounds great actually.. having a date with a cute guy

Then the conversation kept on and on with a lot of other subjects. So the day and the hour arrived, i lived maybe like five minutes away from the bar so i prepared myself and all making myself handsome, with a black trousers, DM boots turtleneck and a cardigan. It was my first date out of a relationship so i was so nervous and a bit sweaty at the moment. i arrived at the bar waiting on him i take out my stuff to smoke (yes i‚Äôm a smoker) and i start rollint myself a cigarette. He arrived a bit out of nowhere while i was doing my cigarrette and i saw a 6ft tall white male with a moustache really curly mid dark brown hair, he was a bit chubby but not problem with that and really beautiful hazel eyes who literally catch your breath. Nathan was damn handsome. So he seat with me and roll his cigarette and we smoke together and ordered a coffee and kept yapping laughing and he rizzed me a lot. The whole time my ex kept sending messages and calling me it was hell.

As the day goes by we decide to pay and go for a walk so we walk for a long time talking. Then arrives to the supposed end, i told him ‚Äòwhen do you go home?‚Äô He told me ‚Äòanytime‚Äô so we kept talking and by joking he said ‚Äòwhat if you come by my flat‚Äô. I look at him seriously and i said ‚Äòi have something plan but.. i can make an exception‚Äô. We both laughed and he go wait to his car while i go prepare my stuff, i was a bit scared i never really done that going to some stranger‚Äôs place after the first day but why not? So i arrived at his car, he ride the ride wasn‚Äôt much of a talk because he was concentrated on the road ‚Äòcause it was night time. So we arrived at his place and it was a bit of a mess but it‚Äôs nothing i didn‚Äôt mind it at all. I put my stuff next to the bed, then he goes take a shower because he was sweaty and all. I waited smoking at his window (he told me i could because he always do it.) i finish my cigarettes and sit on his bed waiting because i needed the bathroom to change myself too. He finally comes back, i take my stuffs and go changing myself in the bathroom then comme back. I go on the bed and we start listening to music then watching memes, after that we laungh an frenchtuber (a french NightMind like if ykyk). We watch peacefully and after like 30 minutes he kissed me, a nice kiss. Then we stopped and jept on the video, watching cuddlint snuggling really affectionate and all. Then just a bit ago we started kissing a clearly more intense one a bit like making out, he knew i didn‚Äôt wanted to have sex that day so we didn‚Äôt but we kissed a lot and we cuddle a lot, both of us didn‚Äôt sleept more than at least two hours.

The morning Nathan was sick for no particular reason he was vomiting and all, i was doing my bed cuddling him and trying to be with him. I was a bit uncomfortable because i couldn‚Äôt really do much on the moment. Nathan felt bad being sick because he wanted to have a nice day with me but he was in bed all the moment then in the bathroom vomiting. Then my ex harrassed me again, i told Nathan ‚Äòhey i‚Äôm sorry i‚Äôll just take the call to say to him leave me alone‚Äô. Nathan just nodded and i was i. The hallway arguing with my ex it was hell again, then he heard Nathan vomiting and he knew what was happening and again he yeld and argue with me. After all that we finished the call, i didn‚Äôt wanted to leave Nathan alone too long so i came back. He said ‚Äòi would definnatly make rice but i don‚Äôt have the energy‚Äô i said ‚Äòi can make some‚Äô he was against it at first but then accepted it. I‚Äôm not a bad cook but i‚Äôm not the bed i do good dishes mostly, but i undercooked the rice and it felt terrible and stupid, he ate a bit saying ‚Äòi can‚Äôt eat not because you cook it but because my stomach can‚Äôt take it‚Äô. i didn‚Äôt know if it was an excuse or not i didn‚Äôt push anything and i pack my stuff a few hours later to leave giving him a small kiss.

After that we both texted a bit by messages while i was going home but long replies because he was sleeping, vomiting and physically/mentally exhausted. It became a bit weird we texted for a few days after the date then one day he stopped texting, ghosting me leaving me on read. I tried to talk to him but always on seen so, when he was online i sended a message saying ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs the ick did i do something?‚Äô He said it was nothing i didn‚Äôt do anything wrong and he was just exhausted, he needed time to think about things and all. he told me he was sick all week.

Since then he didn‚Äôt send a text he left me on seen. i don't know what i did wrong in all i'm completly lost. does anyone can tell me what's wrong ? or maybe i'm just overthinking? it's been two weeks with no news and only my messages left on read. Should i propose to see each other again having another date ?

I am also a software developer, so my role consists of needing to stare at screens for hours on end. As you can see, I have spent some time trying to perfect my WFH setup. After many months and ¬£¬£¬£, I've finally made it look as 'Pinterest-y' as possible.

https://preview.redd.it/es7h3wt4q22e1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08e37977933a0f1e7a7b93b0e59bdb0cdeacda65

Problem is, I seem to hate working on the desk and ultimately at home now. I look for any chance I can get to not work from home and pop to a coffee shop or a co-working space. It's counterintuitive to the whole WFH narrative that I very much enjoy. The coffee shop I choose to use is completely encased in tall glass panes so I get 100% light and get to actually see the outdoors. The same goes for the co-working space - it's on the 10th floor of a high-rise office block so naturally get stunning views and more importantly, light.

I have put it down to the amount of light that comes into the room itself. The second image is an older picture of when I first started to get the room done. The image has been corrected to show you the amount of light that came in on average from July to August. Decrease the light by another 30% now and completely eliminate any 'warmness' and you get the picture. Every morning I walk in and it's incredibly grey and cold looking, despite all the decor etc. It makes sitting on the desk for 6+ hours miserable. It doesn't help that the room is north-facing (no sun), there is a huge tree that blocks about 80% of the view and light directly outside the house and to top it off, there is an apartment block three times the height of the house opposite the road which blocks a lot of of light coming from the skies (even when not sunny).

https://preview.redd.it/1il8q7e6q22e1.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2f987ee5956f19ddbb352bd98dd298727ebf507

I have tried adding warm light neon lights (like the one you see in the picture) above the window to 'emulate' sunlight but this is usually a miss. I turn on the main ceiling light but that just lacks the power to make any difference and it also feels odd to leave the light on all day. I am yet to try floor lamps that uplight but not sure if anyone can attest to that working?

Unfortunately, I am unable to move rooms as there is no adequate space to do so, not with my setup. It would mean I am downstairs in the living room and I live in a big family with 2 cats and a dog. I seldom focus in this room, downstairs would be a write off. I'm also not planning to move home until for at least 3 years yet, which would have been an ideal situation where I could pick and choose a place to stay that would suit the lighting needs. Aside from that, I guess what I am asking is how can I 'force' myself to sit on my desk and just work or at least enjoy working from my desk.

Open to all thoughts and suggestions here. Maybe it's a case of just getting on with it but hoping someone who's been or is in the same boat can share their workaround.

That said, I‚Äôve noticed that many places I‚Äôve visited tend to serve drinks that are very milk-heavy‚Äîlike a 12oz cup with just a single shot of espresso. Personally, I prefer something with a stronger coffee-to-milk ratio, and I‚Äôve been struggling to find a spot that matches my preferences.

Day 1 started at 9 AM with a man uninstalling my toilets and doors. By 10 AM, he *vanished*. No explanation, no heads-up‚Äîjust gone. At 11:30 AM, the install coordinator called to check in, and I explained the situation. They assured me he‚Äôd gone to grab something and would return soon.

By 3 PM, still no sign of him, so I called Service Pros. The coordinator said there was a miscommunication between them and the installer but promised everything has been sorted out and they will be back tomorrow. I told him they need to come back and reinstall at least one toilet. At 7 PM, a ""field supervisor"" showed up, reinstalled a toilet, and apologized. When I asked why the original guy couldn‚Äôt do that before leaving, he said he sent him to help a newer employee at another job.

The tools stayed in my garage overnight for the crew to use the next day.

Day 2 rolled around. At 11 AM, two different men arrived. I offered them coffee, and eventually even provided lunch and dinner. They then told me they‚Äôd been told it was only *one* bathroom to work on‚Äînot two. I said it's always been two and they got started regardless and said ""it's OK. No problem.""

Around 7:30 PM, as they were finishing up, I overheard them on the phone with the ""field supervisor."" They said they wouldn‚Äôt be installing the toilets or quarter molding because ""the job was flooring only."" After some back-and-forth, they reluctantly agreed to install one toilet, since they‚Äôd uninstalled it themselves earlier.

**Here‚Äôs where things took a wild turn.**

The two guys pulled me aside to confess: they weren‚Äôt regular employees. They‚Äôd found out about this job through **Facebook Marketplace**! They explained they were told it was a smaller project and had just learned they wouldn‚Äôt even be paid until *Friday*. Despite everything, they finished the floors, installed both toilets, and left.

I‚Äôm still in shock. Is this normal for Service Pros? Would Lowe‚Äôs knowingly allow their contractors to hire random people off the street with no vetting or background checks? No proper training, no accountability, and potential safety concerns for a homeowner.

The ""field supervisor"" is supposed to come by today to pick up his tools and fix a few minor details the two men left unfinished. But I‚Äôm left wondering: should I escalate this? Is it worth contacting Lowe's Corporate?

Has anyone else experienced something like this with Service Pros or Lowe‚Äôs? Any advice on how I should handle this situation would be greatly appreciated!",0,1732115809.0,Lowes,8,0.33,False

I ordered for the first time on 12th November, got my shipping number(XPO) on 15th November and by 17th November(Sunday) it is in my town.  
  
**19th November**

I just received my order. I didn't opened any, coz I am out of town and my friend picked it. Will see the order tomorrow  
As far my friend says, the package looks good and few packages looks like they are opened once

meanwhile  
Few Questions asked in the comments are:  
The category that I purchased - Computers, Office Equipment category  
The lot says MSRP - $11,053 and the seller has only 2 items listed with 1 review of 5 star. Lot costs me $375 and shipping costs - $458, shipping is costly than the lot :( coz it says it is 600Lbs

**20th November:**

I am really really happy to see the products that I received, the lot has 56 products and out of 56, only 2-3 boxes seems like not properly packed. Every item is perfectly packed. 10/10 for packing (coz it is way better than I expected)

I checked the items, though the electronics are ranged between 2017-2020 designs, they are working awesome.  
7xCPU's - 4GB RAM and 256GB SSD  
2xACER Chrome Book -> They have big bezels, which resembles old style laptops  
2xmonitors, 2xCoffee Maker, 1xToasterOven and 6 remote control cars(they are woowww, liked them and worked. This is the first product I tested right after checking the lot) and few other small items

I can't comment the seller name, but he is a private seller, with 1 review and I just bought with hope. Now need to think, how can I sell these stuff -\_-  
This is the first time I am into this and right after I came to know about liquidation I ordered on the same day. I came to know about liquidation at around 9:00AM and I purchased around 1:30PM",2,1732115782.0,Flipping,2,0.75,False

1gvrr0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1gvrr0m/tipping_wtf/,Tipping WTF,"
It‚Äôs wild how many tipping debates I‚Äôve seen over the past six months. Every day, someone‚Äôs venting about tipping culture. Sometimes, I‚Äôll jump in and try to explain things to people who don‚Äôt understand how tipping works in certain industries. But honestly, those chats usually end with me calling them out, and them telling me to ‚Äúgo look it up.‚Äù So, here‚Äôs my take‚Äîonce and for all.

I worked in restaurants for over a decade. I‚Äôve been a server, bartender, and manager at a full-service restaurant. I left after COVID because, frankly, people lost their minds, and no paycheck is worth the abuse we started getting.

Yes, tipping prompts are popping up everywhere these days. If you don‚Äôt want to tip when you grab a coffee or a snack, just hit ‚ÄúNo Tip‚Äù and move on. The cashier didn‚Äôt put that option there. It‚Äôs either the owner‚Äôs doing or something programmed into the card reader by the manufacturer. Honestly, in those cases, the tip probably doesn‚Äôt even go to the worker you‚Äôre trying to support. So, don‚Äôt stress about it. If the machine asks you for a tip at a gas station or convenience store, decline and keep it moving. It‚Äôs not a big deal.

Now, this changes when you sit down at a full-service restaurant. If you walk in already thinking about how much you‚Äôll tip, or worse, deciding your server has to ‚Äúearn it,‚Äù you‚Äôre setting yourself up for a bad time. You‚Äôre not going to enjoy your food, your company, or the experience because you‚Äôll be too busy judging everything the server does. Instead, try going in with a positive mindset. Smile, use your server‚Äôs name, and thank them. It‚Äôs not hard, and you‚Äôll probably get great service. If the service isn‚Äôt great, leave a fair tip anyway and either don‚Äôt come back or give them another shot.

Let‚Äôs talk about why tipping matters. Servers and bartenders aren‚Äôt all the same. Some are career professionals who genuinely love the work. Others are students or people working a second job to make ends meet. For example, in my state, the minimum wage is $13/hour for most workers, but servers only make $7/hour. Sure, some high-end restaurant servers can clear six figures, but your average suburban bar-and-grill server is lucky to make $35K a year. They rely on tips to survive.

And for anyone saying, ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt like it, they should get another job,‚Äù just stop. People choose their work for all kinds of reasons‚Äîflexibility, the people, or simply because they enjoy it. It‚Äôs not your place to judge.

On the flip side, the argument that restaurant owners should just pay more sounds great in theory, but it‚Äôs not that simple. Running a restaurant is ridiculously expensive, which is why most of them fail. If owners had to pay quality servers $30/hour, menu prices would skyrocket at least 75 percent. That $12 burger? It‚Äôd be $21. A $42 dinner for two would suddenly cost $75.25. Tipping 20% is still cheaper than that.

So here‚Äôs the deal: if you don‚Äôt want to tip, don‚Äôt go to a sit-down restaurant. Order takeout or cook at home. But if you‚Äôre going to sit down and be served, tipping is part of the deal. Servers deal with so much‚Äîmessy kids, rude customers, drunk idiots, and, for women especially, constant harassment. They do it all while juggling multiple tables and trying to make you happy.

Next time you go out, remember that your server is a person with a tough job. Be decent, tip fairly, and stop making it harder than it needs to be.

1gvropj,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1gvropj/am_i_in_the_wrong_here/,am i in the wrong here?,"late in the afternoon, my mom and I decided to go to a caf√© to eat since I've been craving their food for some time now. I got up to the counter and looked at their menu board on the countertop. i asked the staff if i can take their menu board to our table (since they have several menu boards available) and i don't want to hold the line while I'm still discussing our order and I want my mom to pick what she might like (and explain the food to her).


when I we decided our order. I went to the line, actually, there's no line. there was a group of 3 people hovering on the counter picking their order, the cashier was waiting for them to decided as well. so i waited for my turn patiently. They kept changing their minds, laughing, and joking around. mind you, they are professionals, wearing a uniform and logo of where they work. (i mean, there's nothing wrong with it, what started to tick me off is one of them kept backing up to me, knowing I'm in the back).

after they were done, they went to their table, obviously. 

when it was my turn, i was asking the cashier about a specific order about some of their non-coffee drinks since i can't tolerate coffee (you know some caf√© have fancy names for their drinks without descriptions and i kinda want to try it. conclusions, i regretted buying it. hehe. sorry). 

i took the opportunity to ask because no one is behind me. in short, I'm not making someone wait for their turn.

while the cashier was explaining the drinks to me, one lady from the group who ordered before me came up to the counter beside me and interrupted the cashier. she said, ""we want to add bla bla bla."" (Sorry, i couldn't remember what it was since i started to get irritated at this point).

the cashier looked at her but still explained the drinks to me and what was available, but this lady kept saying, ""we want to add bla bla bla."" 

she said it several times and even handed her cash to the cashier while IT WAS STILL MY TURN TO ORDER. my turn wasn't even done. it didn't sit right for me because first and foremost, the cashier is still taking my order; second, their added order will still be given at the same time with their earlier order, no need to rush. the caf√© isn't even busy or packed; last but not the least, they are professionals, so i expected them to act like one and have etiquettes (or am i just expecting too much?)

so i wrapped up my order, and the cashier repeated my order in case he missed something. when it was good, i paid for it. in that whole time, the lady was still standing beside me, handing her money still. 

am i in the wrong here to feel irritated? am i being petty?

I always turn to these celebrities when I'm starting to hit rock bottom,

Frank Sinatra
David Harbour 
Jim Carrey

And some more.

Reading and seeing them having/had their bipolar moments, that makes me feel bad for them and understanding they're might be in an episode, makes me feel ok in a way. Don't take me wrong, I'm sad for them to have to deal with bipolar disorder. I wish they didn't had to.

But hearing their crazy stories, when they haven't been perfect, makes me feel seen. I've had horrible episodes where I've been an awful person. I've done and said things I would never do. Seriously, I've said hideous things. Things that's unacceptable and unforgivable. Which makes me feel so much shame and regret. Actions that have hurt people's feelings and losing friends by it. Being rude to people who didn't deserve it. So many things I've decided to do, thats just not ok at all.

I hate bipolar disorder. I can't handle that I can get so extreme. Get crazy ideas and thoughts. Become someone who isn't me. So easily to start fights with anyone. Friends, family, and strangers. Losing jobs and can't finish studies. Found escape through alcohol (thankfully not currently. Stayed away from it. Only few times I've drank wine - with a friend and not alone). Economy is shit. Debt and reckless spending. I would have been more able to do things if I was more responsibl. Be able to meet friends and get a cup of coffee. Purchase more toys for my cat and new cat tree (dw, he always have food and clean litter box. He also have a lot of toys. He always goes first. I rather go hungry as long he has full tummy). 
I also wish I could meet someone, date and perhaps start a relationship. But I'm never stable enough to do so. Pretty much accepted that I might be single forever or for a very long time.

It's frustrating having to deal with bipolar disorder.

Excuse me for pouring out whats on my mind. The purpose of this post was to appreciate celebrities who have been open with having bipolar disorder. I guess I had to let these thoughts out. Maybe it didn't make any sense.

To end this post, I have a question.

Do you have a celebrity you can relate with who has bipolar disorder? Do you find comfort by doing so?

Their advice was that if I get a fine to ask for evidence. Will this work or will I just end up in more trouble?

1gvrimp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVFD/comments/1gvrimp/tips_for_thanksgiving_safety_social_media_posts/,Tips for Thanksgiving Safety Social Media Posts for Volunteer Fire Departments,"Most people are excited to celebrate Thanksgiving, but it's imperative to stay mindful of safety during this festive time. As a volunteer fire department, you play a key role in spreading awareness about fire hazards associated with cooking and outdoor festivities. Utilizing your social media platforms to share engaging safety tips can help protect your community and raise awareness about your department's vital services. In this post, we'll examine into effective strategies to enhance your Thanksgiving safety messaging and maximize its impact.

UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFETY MESSAGING
A clear and effective safety messaging strategy is crucial for promoting well-being during Thanksgiving. By sharing tips and guidelines, you help raise awareness about potential hazards associated with cooking, travel, and gatherings. Engaging content not only informs but also encourages your community to prioritize safety, ensuring everyone can enjoy their celebrations with peace of mind.

THE ROLE OF VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS
After a long history of dedicated service, volunteer fire departments play a vital role in fostering community safety. Your position as a trusted resource allows you to share important safety information related to fire hazards and emergency preparedness. By utilizing your social media platforms, you provide crucial guidance that keeps everyone informed and safe during festive gatherings.

COMMUNITY IMPACT OF SAFETY AWARENESS
Among the many benefits of promoting safety awareness is the fostering of a cohesive, prepared community. When you actively engage your neighbors in safety discussions, you're not just sharing valuable information; you're also empowering them to take action. This collective effort can significantly reduce the likelihood of accidents, ensuring that your community enjoys a joyful and secure Thanksgiving holiday.

Safety awareness campaigns can make a profound difference in your community's overall well-being. By emphasizing practices such as using cooking timers, checking smoke alarms, and keeping fire extinguishers accessible, you help individuals avoid potential dangers. During this festive season, it's important to prevent incidents like kitchen fires and ensure safe travel. Your proactive approach boosts community spirit and demonstrates that, with the right precautions, everyone can enjoy a meaningful and accident-free celebration.

CRAFTING EFFECTIVE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS
Some tips for crafting effective social media posts include using straightforward language, eye-catching visuals, and clear calls-to-action. By focusing on readability and audience engagement, you can effectively share important safety messages with your community. Utilize platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, ensuring your tone reflects both professionalism and approachability in every post.

KEY SAFETY TIPS TO HIGHLIGHT
An excellent approach is to emphasize vital safety tips for your community during Thanksgiving. Consider sharing the following safety tips:

 * Keep cooking areas unobstructed and clean
 * Never leave cooking food unattended
 * Use oven mitts to handle hot cookware
 * Check smoke alarms before gatherings

After providing these reminders, encourage your audience to share their safety tips in the comments.

ENGAGING VISUAL CONTENT
Alongside your written content, incorporating engaging visual content can significantly enhance the effectiveness of your social media posts. Images, infographics, or short videos can elucidate safety tips and attract the viewer's attention more than text alone.

Social media users tend to engage more with visual elements. Use bright colors, and clear graphics, and incorporate your fire department's branding to forge a connection with your audience. Including images of your firefighters in action, holiday safety demonstrations, or even fun community events can help humanize your department. Always aim to highlight the most important information, such as fire safety protocols and emergency contact numbers, ensuring your posts remain not only eye-catching but also informative and resourceful.

TIMING YOUR POSTS FOR MAXIMUM REACH
Any effective social media strategy hinges on understanding when your audience is most active. By aligning your posts with optimal engagement times, you can increase visibility and strengthen community relationships. For Thanksgiving safety posts, consider scheduling your content for early mornings or evenings when families are likely to be planning their holiday celebrations and checking social media for tips and information.

OPTIMAL POSTING TIMES
Your audience is most engaged during specific periods, typically late morning and early evening, particularly around the Thanksgiving holiday. Aim to post when users are likely to scroll through their feeds, either during their morning coffee or after their holiday dinner. This timing will help ensure your safety messages reach those who need them most.

* Language headaches: Real-time translation in 80+ languages.
* Workflow inefficiency: Automates the boring stuff so humans can do the strategic stuff.

**Target users?**  
E-commerce store owners, HR teams, marketers, content creators, and pretty much anyone tired of reinventing the wheel.

**Why me?**  
I‚Äôve been building APIs and platforms for over 20 years. This is 100% my brainchild. No co-founders, no rich dad, no backup plan‚Äîjust me, a keyboard, and way too much coffee.

When I fill it with water to the top of the sight glass and flip it on high, about half the time, it heats up as normal, and the other half of the time, it will heat up over an extremely long Period (about 30 mins), and if you listen to it, you can hear the element heating for about 15 seconds and then stopping for a minute before starting again.

Sometimes it never even comes to temperature, and I turn it off and use a different coffee brew method. I‚Äôve bypassed the fuse, but the machine does not have a pressurstat. I cleaned and re-attached all electrical contacts,  so I‚Äôm wondering what the problem might be. Bad switch? Bad element?

Of note, 2 weeks ago there was a session where the machine made a periodic ""thumping"" noise when heating up, but it stopped and worked normally after that for some time. On visual inspection from the fill hole, the element is is decent shape, with no scale or obvious deformities.

1gvrhqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1gvrhqq/through_hell_and_back/,Through hell and ‚Äò‚Äôback‚Äô‚Äô,"Hi im looking for a bit of ‚Äòadvice‚Äô and maybe some experience of others who went through something similar.

January-June: I was on agomelatine, doing pretty good, was working out, going to Uni, everything went pretty well but I started to ruminate again

July: Rumination kept going (although i was still doing pretty good and working out etc.) and I was afraid of having an episode so I switched to sertralin 25mg ( it‚Äôs my gold standard med)

Had a fucking terrible reaction, I know sertralin makes you a bit more anxious at the beginning but this shit was next level, could sleep and was waking up extremly anxious and stressed out. That went on for 2-3 weeks. After that I was afraid depression will get me so I increased to 50. Again same side effects but alles intense: but it left me with pure lethargy and I had no motivation. So I upped it to 75‚Ä¶ again side effects, anxiety agitation‚Ä¶and as this passed it left me with even less motivation. 
Going up to 100, anxiety went through the roof, I couldn‚Äôt handle it so I called my psychiatrist. 

üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è: no way, sertralin doesn‚Äôt do this‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the depression, you have a severe depression. We need to change the sertralin to escitalopram 20mg  as soon as possible. That‚Äôs when hell began: escitalopram fucked me up. Sleep was not an option, I was always tired yet anxious and energized. Had a crazy ear ringing‚Ä¶that went on for weeks until one day‚Ä¶ the anxiety lessened but I still could sleep, was all over the place, couldn‚Äôt focus on anything ( was driving my friends to the airport and missing every fucking direction of google Maps).  My psychiatrist told me: the sleep issue is the depression, I have to accept the deseasr and take time off ‚Ä¶ it will get better. But fuck it didn‚Äôt and I was pretty sure I could sleep due to escitalopram‚Ä¶ it felt like being overstimulated. So next thing: he gives me Opipramol which should calm me down. Plot twist .. it made me even more anxious and I could sleep at all. So he then gave me fucking Zoplicon which was sort of good for sleep (although only 5 hours and waking up 2-3 times per night). And he told me the anxiety is not from medication ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the depression and gave me lorazepam.

So I had enough‚Ä¶either I would take this shit and stop telling my self I‚Äôm not feeling depressed, the sleep problems and the anxiety feels like it‚Äôs med. induced. - or just say fuck it I trust my self I thing it‚Äôs the escitalopram. 

Ti traded pretty quickly and took sertralin again. 3-4 days later the anxiety was gone. But as I went up with sertralin I continued to loose my motivation. Now I‚Äôm at 100 and I don‚Äôt give a flying fuck. I don‚Äôt go to Uni, wake up stressed. Don‚Äôt feel particularly depressed but holy moly I don‚Äôt want anything in life üòÖ. Just doing nothing all day. Can‚Äôt drink coffee cause more then 1 will make me anxious. (Usually I drink 3-5)

So went  down to 75 and the initial side effects came back but in a really subtle way‚Ä¶ a bit of anxiety ‚Ä¶a bit of fatigue.

After all this my doc thinks I maybe have adhd. I‚Äôm going to get assessed as soon as possible but in the meantime he told me I could take bupropion 150mg  and add it to the 75mg. 

Again I got pretty anxious with the bupropion after 1 dose so I didn‚Äôt continue with it. It‚Äôs manageable anxiety but after all I went through I am jused burned out and it makes me spiral instantly. (Afraid of not getting my old self, having an Anxiety disorder, the depression is coming back and so on‚Ä¶) I can‚Äôt handle another adjustment period. 

Do you guys have any advice? You think I should continue the bupropion? How long does this last? Thanks!",1,1732115005.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

I remember picking it up and thinking, wow, this bug is a lot larger than a grasshopper. It was so unique! I couldn‚Äôt wait to show my mom, so I brought it home. She was there with her friend, having tea or coffee, and I proudly announced, ‚ÄúOh, look at this bug I got!‚Äù

I built this app called [Self Sport](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/self-sport-ai-for-gratitude/id6450458673) that's now in the app store for iPhone. 

I'm sharing it here today for three reasons:

1. I just this week found this community
2. Self Sport has changed my life for the better, and I want others to know about it
3. Reading the discussions here, it seems relevant

  
**Some background, if interested**

Initially, I built Self Sport with mental health & wellness in mind. There is ample research/evidence around the importance of 'high satisfaction in various life domains' (""role balance"") for a person's overall performance, happiness, adaptability to negative or challenging feedback and more. 

I'd struggled for *years* with anxiety and obsessive negative thoughts particularly around social situations -- speaking, sure, but even waiting in lines at one point. It got bad! I just had a lot of fear of anxiety and stress response. This was despite having good relationships and a good career and health. I'm also a man, and mental health is sort of stigmatized for men still, I found.

As I started to look into the role of my self-image instead of trying quick-cures for anxiety attacks, I got deep into how our identities, our actions towards those identities and our *variety* in life forms us. 

I realized that my life was a bit out of control. A routine I didn't influence much anymore, largely revolving around my social life, going out, and work. There was a lot *missing* if I was being deeply honest with the inner Clay, and I wasn't happy. I didn't want to be seen. 

Addressing life balance in a simple way, which busy people could adopt, became a project/mission of mine. I designed, built, and *banged-my-head-against-the-wall-hundreds-of-times* this myself. Glad it's out.

  
**What kind of person might use Self Sport**

People can use Self Sport throughout their day or as a daily timed practice. Personally, I mostly just post at the end of the day and do the 'wellness session' (see the features down further) in mornings. Whatever works.

* **Interested in life tracking:** I don't really think of Self Sport as a mental health app anymore. It's a life tracker. An activity tracker. A log of our days. 
* **That is simple to use:** If you would be interested in keeping a RECORD of your life, without longform journaling commitment, with some of the ease of a workout tracker, this might be good for you.
* **Believes in the Measured Self:** It's a bit stoic as a practice, life tracking. The app tags every logged activity to one of 12 major life categories. You can also combine them. Physical Health, Love Life, Family, Friends, Chores, Mind, Hobbies, Rest, Experiences, Education, Personal Goals, Work. This aligns loosely to Maslow's hierarchy. Of course the app shows your balance across these.
* **Would rather browse your own ""Feed"":** The app really orients around a running log of the actions in your life. It also recalls past actions in the home view, showing you what you did 30 days ago in detail. You can sort your history by life category, date, etc.

  
**The features that make the app**

* **Easy ""Post"" Button:** Very simple UI. Just hit the big green button and add a quick life post. 
* **Life Timeline:** Of course, all posts save as a browsable history.
* **Life Balance View:** Graph views of your balance across life categories. Weekly and All-Time.
* **Goals**: e.g. ""3 Physical Health activities per week"". Shows progress on home page.
* **Self Mind AI:** The app has an AI built in that lets users ask questions, get ideas, challenge, critique, and coach specifically around their life. Ask about specific life categories, get things like a 'personal summary' or 'personal newsletter', get feedback on whether or not you're making progress on your goals, much more here. It's all within the ""Self Mind"" room of the app, which is a chat-like interface with pre-defined prompt buttons. <-- Pro Feature
* **Daily Wellness Session Play-Back:** The app also creates (on demand) a daily session of 3 gratitude statements, 3 intentions and 3 affirmations based on your tracking and specified life goals. These are unique daily and can be played back as Audio in a specific voice. I like to do this on walks as a daily practice. <-- Pro Feature

**A final note about Pro/Free/Trials, etc.**

I've said a lot but wanted to touch on this too. The all is Free for posting life updates, getting the graph views, personal history/timeline, adding photos to posts, all that. The Pro version of Self Sport includes the AI things (Self Mind and the Daily Wellness Session) and the added ability to put videos in your posts. The AI stuff isn't cheap to run (yet) unfortunately -- and I'm a solo builder with no funding. 

Anyway, look, if you're really struggling and want to inquire about a complimentary 'friends and family' version with some extended free period for all features, reach out to me. 

There's also a trial period! 

  
Anyway all, thanks for reading and I hope you'll check this app out. 

Thanks,

The real magic of social media lies not in the number of followers a brand has but in the strength and engagement of its community. Building a loyal, active community takes effort, strategy, and a deep understanding of what people care about. It‚Äôs an art that, when mastered, can transform a brand from being just another name to becoming an essential part of its audience‚Äôs daily lives.

# Start with Listening, Not Posting

Too many brands dive headfirst into social media, flooding their pages with content without first understanding their audience. The foundation of any strong community starts with listening. What are people talking about? What do they care about? What problems are they trying to solve? By engaging in active listening, whether through comments, messages, or even observing trends, you can align your content with what your audience truly values.

When I was working on a gaming-focused social media campaign, for example, I didn‚Äôt just throw out random posts about the games we were promoting. Instead, I spent time understanding what the gaming community was passionate about‚Äîwhether it was behind-the-scenes content, gameplay tips, or discussions about upcoming features. This approach helped us build a strong rapport with the audience and made every post feel personal.

# Consistency is Key

One of the biggest mistakes brands make is inconsistency. Posting sporadically or disappearing for weeks creates a disconnect. Your community needs to know they can rely on you for regular updates, engaging content, and timely responses. A content calendar isn‚Äôt just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs your roadmap to keeping your audience engaged.

Consistency doesn‚Äôt mean being repetitive. It means showing up in ways that resonate. Some days, it‚Äôs a quick Instagram Reel that sparks laughter. Other days, it‚Äôs a thoughtful LinkedIn post sharing industry insights. Every piece of content should contribute to the bigger picture: building trust and fostering connection.

https://preview.redd.it/udp3198ui22e1.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6ccdd8736e56c05fbc10e179989afa3a94c6f7d

  


# Focus on Engagement, Not Just Likes

It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in chasing vanity metrics like likes and follower counts, but these numbers don‚Äôt necessarily reflect the health of your community. True engagement comments, shares, and meaningful conversations‚Äîis what shows your audience is invested in your brand.

One campaign I‚Äôm particularly proud of was for a local lifestyle brand. Instead of focusing on selling products outright, we created posts that sparked conversations. One memorable campaign asked followers to share their morning coffee routines, and the response was incredible. People shared photos, stories, and tagged their friends, all while interacting with the brand. The result? Not just an increase in sales, but a community that felt seen and valued.

# Create Content That Adds Value

Why should someone follow your brand? What are you offering them that they can‚Äôt get elsewhere? These are questions every brand needs to ask when creating content. Value can come in many forms: entertainment, education, inspiration, or a sense of belonging.

When I managed content for an esports community, I realized that players weren‚Äôt just looking for updates about tournaments‚Äîthey wanted to feel part of something bigger. So, we shared player highlights, behind-the-scenes looks at how events were organized, and even funny moments from matches. It wasn‚Äôt just about broadcasting information; it was about creating moments people wanted to engage with and share.

# Humanize Your Brand

People don‚Äôt connect with logos‚Äîthey connect with people. Show the human side of your brand through storytelling. Share the challenges and successes behind your business, introduce your team, and celebrate milestones with your audience.

During a campaign for a fragrance brand, we decided to showcase the artisans behind the products. Short videos captured their passion and craftsmanship, and the audience loved it. The content not only boosted engagement but also created a deeper emotional connection with the brand.

https://preview.redd.it/6vb67j33j22e1.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c718639d092e0a01e6b5cfd2fd4c16c7d65a285



# Leverage Trends Without Losing Identity

Jumping on trends can give your brand a quick boost, but it‚Äôs important to do so in a way that stays authentic to your identity. Audiences are quick to spot when brands are trying too hard to fit into trends that don‚Äôt align with their values.

For example, during a TikTok trend that revolved around transformation videos, we adapted it for a perfume campaign. Instead of following the trend exactly, we created a ‚Äúscent journey‚Äù transformation, showing how a fragrance can change the vibe of your day. It stayed true to the brand while tapping into a popular format.

https://preview.redd.it/c29ncmv4j22e1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=a698029340089278b4ed1d87581da2464ada965f



# Measure, Adjust, Repeat

Building a community is not a one-and-done effort. It requires constant monitoring and adjustment. Analytics tools like Meta Ads Manager and Google Analytics are invaluable for tracking what‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs not. But numbers alone won‚Äôt tell the full story combine data with direct feedback from your audience to fine-tune your approach.

For instance, after noticing a drop in engagement on a campaign, I reviewed the analytics and realized that our content wasn‚Äôt hitting the right posting times for our audience. A simple adjustment in scheduling brought the engagement back up. Being flexible and willing to adapt is key to long-term success.

# The Reward: A Loyal, Thriving Community

When done right, building a social media community isn‚Äôt just about marketing it‚Äôs about creating a space where people feel seen, heard, and connected. It‚Äôs about turning casual followers into advocates who genuinely care about your brand and what it stands for.

Every post, comment, and interaction is a step toward something bigger a thriving, loyal community that supports your brand and helps it grow organically. And that‚Äôs the real magic of social media.

1gvqyqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1gvqyqy/on_living_in_japan_and_the_small_intricacies_of/,"On living in Japan, and the small intricacies of the language as an intermediate learner","Heya, so this post is kinda based on another comment I made, so I thought might as well it can be cool to share my story with others as a post.

I've been studying Japanese alone for the past 4 years or so, and finally was able to fulfill a dream of mine and come to Japan on an exchange program through my Uni for a semester. I've been living here for about 2 and a half months now.

So, there's something that I've picked up in Japanese while staying here. I feel like it's something that you can see in separating a lot of the advanced learners of Japanese from the beginner ones, and that's the **""language mannerisms""**.

Of course vocab and grammar and all this stuff is important, but as you get more used to the language and gain confidence you also pick up the ""in between"" of the language. Which is something that I think I've picked up on and I'm excited about it.

These things can include Áõ∏Êßå like when someone is speaking like „ÅÜ„Çì„ÄÅ„ÅÜ„Çì to show you're following along, or using that kind of „Å∏„Åà„Äú for a surprise, etc.

I've noticed all this after talking to a friend and hearing her speak Japanese (she's currently like in Genki level). I haven't really heard beginners speaking actually since my environment is either my classes who have some pretty good Japanese speakers or just straight up talking to Japanese people. 

I guess it might be part in how as you get better in the language you more ""think in Japanese"" rather than translating, I guess?

Another thing that I've also noticed (and also something I'm working on) is that the better Japanese speakers have much more ""varied"" language, for example in using various sentence enders. (Like „ÅÆ„ÄÅ„Åï„ÄÅ„Åû„ÄÅ„Å™„Äú). Beginners seem to have a kinda *""sterile""* language straight out of a textbook but the more advanced people use a much better flowing language. It's much more fun when you do use these although in my case and it's something I'm working on and trying getting a better hang of when to use what. For example I feel like I over-use „ÅÆ at the end of my questions but a Japanese student I befriended yesterday said it's not really much of a problem and is just a personal choice.

In addition, I feel like as you get better, for many people your **accent** will also change to be more Japanese. I don't think I'm that good to really hear the small differences but *generally* I do hear a difference. For example when I hear my peers speak it does sound more similar to Japanese people Japanese, than when I hear beginners speaking which feels more like ""saying words in Japanese in our native language"" like the pronunciation is different.

All in all it just feels to me that when I'm speaking Japanese I kinda take into a ""persona"" which I think is more fluid.


Another thing that I've noticed, is that being already at a certain intermediate level of the language helps *a lot* in improving more.

For example I've also heard it from a friend who was here last year and it also seems now with my beginner friends, they do get better but they can't actually use all these opportunities like for example how I do.

Like I can hold a conversation in Japanese, even if I'll need sometimes for the person to explain himself more clearly or switch up the words for simpler ones, but I can at least understand a lot of what I'm hearing and that's how I improve. But they on the other hand can't really do that since they're not at that level yet.

So for example with their host families they have to speak English with a few Japanese words here and there. And talking to Japanese students who don't speak English at all is kinda out of reach for them.

It was very apparent yesterday when we toured an elementary school through the exchange program. These little guys don't speak a word of English after all. So if you knew some Japanese you could actually talk to them, if you didn't, you're shit out of luck.

The better you are when coming here, the also better you can get because you can have more quality opportunities.

So yeah, I'm just very excited to see me being able to improve and seeing my hard work pay off. Like I could sit at a coffee hour today of the dorms where the dorm mates gather to chat and stuff and I could understand most of the conversation of the Japanese students and also sometimes participate. Sometimes it's something you take for granted but then you take a step back and you're like ""holy shit I just held an entire conversation in Japanese"". It's nice feeling that I've gotten better and it's been only like 2-3 months? Since I've come here. I've expected it to take much longer since I've had practically no output experience at all, but now with my Japanese host family and Japanese new friend alongside the Japanese lessons and just generally living in Japan I can definitely see my improvement in the language. Of course I still get stuck a lot and forget words and all the deal, but it isn't that hard to speak anymore. When someone asks me something I can already shoot from the hip already a good response to strike up a conversation. It is pretty insane how much you can improve by actually living here. Even if I don't have the same amount of exposure as I'd hoped I still get quite a lot of it.",16,1732113599.0,LearnJapanese,3,0.9,False

But certain states have their own laws. I am trying to get a clear answer from someone if this rule applies to ILLINOIS.

I copied & pasted this from a document that the DOL of IL sent me when I was asking about this. But they could not directly answer my question that if the 80/20/30 law that was recently struck down affected this or not.

Here's what I found.

[Dual Jobs: When an employee is employed by one employer in both a tipped and a non-tipped
occupation, such as an employee employed both as a maintenance person and a waitperson, the tip credit
is available only for the hours spent by the employee in the tipped occupation. The FLSA permits an
employer to take the tip credit for some time that the tipped employee spends in duties related to the
tipped occupation, even though such duties are not by themselves directed toward producing tips. For
example, a waitperson who spends some time cleaning and setting tables, making coffee, and
occasionally washing dishes or glasses is considered to be engaged in a tipped occupation even though
these duties are not tip producing. However, where a tipped employee spends a substantial amount of
time (in excess of 20 percent in the workweek) performing related duties, no tip credit may be taken for
the time spent in such duties.]

I am not seeking legal advice. I am trying to find out if Illinois CURRENTLY follows this law (pasted above) or if the 80/20/30 law that was recently struck down affected this.

I am in a situation where the employer I work for has us doing 1-1.5hr of work before opening and 1-1.5hr after closing. Including deep cleaning duties that is expected to be done at the end of the work week when it's slow.
I just want to know what the current laws are on this in ILLINOIS.",1,1732113471.0,LaborLaw,0,1.0,False

What he didn't know was that his stepmother had loaded the gun. He shot his castmate, who didn't survive. I was able to find a newspaper article that confirmed the story.""
7. ""My grandparents ran a speakeasy during prohibition and bought liquor from Joe Kennedy. They always said he carried the best, straight from Ireland and Canada. They also ran the local black market during WWII. When a family was hosting soldiers, they made sure there was enough food for the family and soldiers. Local shopkeepers supported this. I miss my grandparents‚Ä¶""
8. ""Last Thanksgiving, my grandma just casually revealed that her twin brother (my great uncle who passed away around 20 years ago) got drunk one night, slept with his step-daughter, and got her pregnant. I had no inkling anything like this ever happened and wish I could take back not knowing.""
9. ""All my life, my grandmother always told us, her granddaughters, to never trust an older man. When she was dying of cancer, she finally told us why she always said that. During the depression, she had a young man she loved. However, the family desperately needed money. So my grandmother, in her early 20s, was forced by her family to marry a wealthy man who was in his 80s. My grandmother would not have an affair with the man she loved because if she got pregnant, everyone would know her husband was not the father. Unfortunately, she did become pregnant ‚Äî by her husband in his 80s. But everyone believed she had an affair with the man she loved.""
10. ""My maternal grandmother was kidnapped on horseback as a young adult by my grandfather with the help of a group of his friends and taken into the nearby mountains of their hometown for a couple of days until she agreed to marry him. The first time she told anyone was at a random family event, and everyone listening was shocked. They kept asking questions to get her to admit that that's what she wanted ‚Äî I guess to ease their discomfort. Ever since, anytime it's brought up, she always reaffirms how much this upsets her. Once, when my grandma and I were alone, she started talking about what happened to her.""
11. ""My uncle told me some wild history about my grandfather. At 16, he lied about his age and enlisted in WWI. During the war, he was hit by a grenade a year later at Vimy Ridge. He was left for dead as his abdominal wound was extensive, and it was assumed he would die. A young soldier from his town recognized him and carried him over his shoulder to the Red Cross station. He had a long road to recovery and eventually went back home.""
12. ""My grandfather was born and raised in Kentucky. In his early 20s, he moved to Chicago and got a job driving a truck from Chicago to Detroit and from Detroit to Windsor, Canada. When I was a teenager, I was looking through a box of photos and found a photo of my grandfather with a man I didn't know. When I asked him who it was, he wouldn't answer. My grandma grabbed it from me, tore it into pieces, and threw it in the trash. My grandfather said, 'All I did was drive a truck.' My mom laughed and said, 'Were you running whiskey for Al Capone?' My grandfather got up and went outside. When he came back, he sternly said again that all he did was drive a truck. That was the end of the discussion. From his reaction,  my mom and I believed he drove for the Mafia.""
13. ""Found out my father's crazy grandmother in Sicily had shot a man and put him in a freezer! I also found out my dad wasn't my biological father! I was glad!""
14. ""Ten-plus years ago, my mom casually mentioned to me one day that my grandfather (her dad) had murdered someone. This struck me as quite odd because my grandfather, whom I was never close to and rarely saw, was living a full, good life. She told me that he had been involved with some 'gangster' types in New York at the time and that he and another guy had 'taken care' of a guy by running him over.""
15. ""My grandmother had seven kids with her abusive husband. My grandfather ended up dying, supposedly of a heart attack, but I suspect it was drugs as he was in his early 30s. My grandma remarried and bore two more kids, only to leave that husband and take up with my grandfather's brother (her deceased husband's brother).""
16. ""I asked my uncle who exactly our aunt was to us because I never understood where she came from, but the family was always close. It turns out my grandfather was a womanizer who dated my grandmother's sister before he dated and married my grandmother. Apparently, at some point after being with my grandmother (not sure if they were married yet or not), he got her sister pregnant. This aunt was, in fact, both my dad's half-sister and cousin‚Ä¶ Jerry Springer would have loved my grandpa. He ended up leaving grandma and the three boys they had and never took care of any of those children (financially or paternally), including my aunt.""
17. [""My grandfather was very ill with an infection in his brain in his late 80s. My immediate family were all taking turns being with him in the hospital, anticipating these would be our last visits with him. He wasn't always lucid; he sort of floated in between his past and his present. One evening, I came to stay with him, and he began to address me as his lifelong best friend, which I thought was really endearing. He asked me/his friend to sit beside his bed, so I did.""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/aqibspeaks/what-type-of-best-friend-are-you)

I think it would have the opposite effect.  Many would be pissed that they had been required to do / believe those things for generations if they had not been necessary.  But deeper than that, doing stupid shit that makes you look odd, suffering for Jesus, is actually something that fosters belief in people.  Is there an inborn human instinct that God wants us to suffer or that denying pleasure pleases him?   I don‚Äôt know, but the more people sacrifice for the church, the more the church demands from them, the more they seem to feel like they are doing right and the more it fosters a sense of superiority.  I can‚Äôt think of a high demand religion that relaxed its standards and grew.  The Protestant denominations that did it declined drastically.  To be clear, I believe these changes are morally correct and should be made.

It tasted awful, had aroma similar to gasoline and even expensive whiskey taste made me gag.

I never considered myself as a person with a problem, I drank ""normal amount"" for people in my country. Drinking every weekend was pretty much expected here.

Once I started to tell people that no, I stopped drinking and I won't drink with them some were surprised and tried to convince me anyway. I stood my ground. They asked what kind of problem made me stop, expecting some story about a crash out. I just told them I don't enjoy it. I didn't want to tell them the gassiness I've had or other gastrointestinal issues, I knew they'd try to brush it off even though they have them too.

They didn't understand. I know you do understand though.

Every single person acts like an asshole when they're drunk. Every. Single. One. Only now I noticed, I'm ashamed that I behaved like that. I really think some people don't want to stop drinking because when you do, you need to confront that thought. The cringiest shit I did was on alcohol, but that's everybody's experience. Some just never remember that.

So yeah, I'm staying off it because of that. Because why wait for your problems to become worse? The faster I address that the more experience I will have with saying that I won't drink with somebody. After some time just everybody knows that for a fact and it gets easier.

Right now I've replaced alcohol when going out by just grabbing coffee or tea. Sometimes I get coconut water if I want to get fancy. For things like steaks, I get tonic water as something bitter to cleanse my pallet - works the same way as alcohol for that! If they have San Pellegrino, that's what I usually order.

I don't miss it. I'm almost never thinking about getting alcohol. I addressed my anxiety with therapy and meds, now it's way better - I don't need to dull it to be able to socialize anymore. Right now I'm way more of a social butterfly than ever before!

I ask server what theire ice cream dessert actually is and if I can swap ice cream flavors. Like I am not making sure if ice cream dessert consists of ice cream and dessert but like what ice cream it is, are there any froots and if I can modify my order. For some reason this question was enough to create some sort of awkwardness. It's not like I am asking if fried shrimp rice was fried by a shrimp.

- Had some health issues, talking with doctor via phone. I said that I fainted twice in a short period of time. After few more questions she asked me if I was conscious when I fainted. I asked her two times if that's what she really ment, when she said yes, I replied that it doesn't makes sense to me - apparently this is an example of bad communication from my end and I should have interpreted it in a way that the doctor is actually asking me if I recall the thing actually happening and she actually was suggesting that I might had memory loss.

- I've dropped out of uni by choice when I was younger. I was studying electrical engineering and it was like a torture to me so switched to CS. Today I saw some local infographics that recently there are more offers in EE than for CS majors. So I said look, even tho I would not be happy about it but I can swap in the future if that would be needed. My so said that it could have been worse/harder if I stayed in EE all that time without remote work which I have currently - this was supposed to be to cheer me up. like I understand the intention and meaning of what she said but I completely don't understand the point of her saying such hypothetical even if it's true - it's does not make sense to me in the context and became a stupid reason for argue.

- When I talk with my partner, during the conversation she can say something like ""someone have an opinion of something"" without saying if she shares the belief as well. So I start engaging in the topic and it turns out that it's not the case (she does not share the same opinion in what she said) and instead of considering the context - I should have asked, because that's how it is during the small talk.

There are multiple other cases like that and it drives me insane.

I feel like there is a difference in mentality where I supposed to interpret information in favor of person I am talking to even if it's really weird and even if it's said by professional. I just think that if the topic is not straightforward and someting is not clear - other person need to somewhat engage in a topic to be better understood (in order to continue the conversation) when there seems to be some sort of obvious doublespeak. Like do you mean what you are saying or are you trying to suggest something? Also if service worker feels awkward/embarrassed if I asked pretty much normal question because I pay money for the service - it's automatically my fault for not getting social clues or something.

Does it sounds like I am on the spectrum, am I just socially awkward or being gaslited? It does not happen often, like once a week or in a two weeks and it becomes some sort of conversation point that there is something wrong we me where I just think that I am being assertive. I have no friends so I can't ask anyone's opinion irl",0,1732112092.0,AutisticAdults,4,0.5,False
