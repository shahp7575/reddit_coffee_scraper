1g11gl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValleyExpanded/comments/1g11gl9/hot_take_sve_gave_back_a_lot_of_the_lost_whimsy/,Hot take: SVE gave back a lot of the lost whimsy SDV 1.6 took away. ,"OF COURSE I LOVE THE ORIGINAL GAME. SVE wouldn't be what it is today if it weren't for SDV. We wouldn't all be here if we didn't love vanilla. 

Okay, you've read what I said right? You now know that I cherish the GAME itself and am thankful for such a wonderful game developer. CA is goat! 

Now that you know I'm no hater, here's my hot take.

Ever since 1.6 I feel like Stardew Valley lost some of its more fantastical qualities. It doesn't feel so much like I'm finding a quiet valley with secrets to find and a hidden charm you realize the more you play the game, anymore. Emphasis on ""so much"" and remember that I'm not saying ""it's gone"".

I was okay with Mr. Qi being in a room somewhere far away, because the occasional brush with the 4th wall was fun and didn't break immersion. But him flying over the valley? Dropping boxes that you and ONLY YOU are aware of... I feel like it's not necessarily breaking the 4th wall so much as being made solidly aware of it. Of its presence. Of its reality. For no other reason.

Meowmere also breaks said 4th wall, introducing a weapon from a different game that looks like a stuffed toy from the wizard's basement üòû. 

The... Moving statues? 

1.5 is so vastly different from 1.6. it doesn't change the game entirely but it changes how it feels, for me personally. 

I actually stopped playing the game a month after the update came out because I couldn't get back into my previous headspace, playing 1.5. 

But why is the whimsy so important to me? Why can't i just have fun in an objectively fun game?? I guess it comes down to the fact that SDV players play the game for different reasons. As someone who grew up playing Harvest Moon FOMT, whimsy is what I yearn for. I want to farm. I want to sell shit. I want to adventure. I want to meet people. And I want to be charmed by a community whose people, culture, and spirit I spend everyday seeking to know more of.

The new SVE 1.15 update was completely unexpected to me. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE UPDATE WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT (save for Flash's few teasers) AND I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS GOING TO GO LIVE WHEN IT DID. 

I've always loved SVE (I'm a bit miffy about making Lewis into this super competent mayor tho), I've always enjoyed a great majority of what it adds, and overall i have so much respect for what it gives players back: the experience of playing the game with so much more to find out, of not knowing what's coming next. 

I thought it was a relatively small update and my plan ever since 1.6 came out was to install the game again when SVE 2.0 came out. Looking at the changelog on nexus absolutely blew my mind. 

I can't explain the relief at feeling EXCITEMENT to play a game i was scared of increasingly losing interest of. It's a big deal because I've spent years loving the heck out of SDV and so i did feel a bit of grief when I realized I didn't (and couldn't) enjoy it the same way I did before. 

It's like your favorite coffee beans changing taste after 10 years because the farmers started using a different soil/fertilizer. It's not the end of the world but you do feel a sense of loss for the cup of coffee you've had every morning. 

1.6 is a but like that for me.

SVE 1.15 was like finding a creamer that made my new coffee brew taste like summer. It's not the same. I'll never get my old coffee back BUT, you find that there's not much to complain about when there's a bit of sun in your cup everytime you make a new one.

SVE pulls all the loose aspects of vanilla into an expansive and compelling story that you can't help but sink your teeth into. 

THERE'S WHIMSY INTO EVERY BLADE OF GRASS ADDED INTO THE GAME. I thought i lost it. But SVE gave it back.

To Flash and everyone involved in the mod: thank you.

I don't like remote work. I think employees should be disciplined for coffee badging. However I hate that the way I have to do it is by denying them raises for good work that they did do over the year. Many of the employees only took the job because it was remote, and it feels like the company is basically making me the be the bad guy that has to enforce an overall policy decision I agree with, but in a way that I feel like is counterproductive. One of my teams most essential employees coffee badges only and is very hard to get along with, but he's also a specialist and incredibly hard to replace. So long as you give him work to do he's very good at getting it done. By far better than anyone else at the company. His 360 degree feedback from his peers is glowing. I've tried to explain to him that business is not about negotiation. It's about following policies and putting your head down and doing your job even when you don't want to. I feel bad because while I don't like managing people that I can't see at all times clearly some of them thrive at it, and don't like to be there. My manager is completely unwilling to budge as our execs are breathing down his neck. HR is ambivalent about the RTO due to recruiting concerns, but our new exec has made it a priority and executive staff have told me that any attempt to challenge it will almost certainly result in termination. We've been asked not to discuss how we feel about it. Even though I like the RTO I think I'd be fine making the rare exception. In addition I've had to ask staff members to not discuss it in our office since they may be overheard. I've had executive staff at least at one point demand I discipline someone for making an MS Teams post complaining about RTO in our ""General Purpose"" channel. Something I also have mixed feelings about. How can I enact these policies under such strict scrutiny while I myself don't agree with the level of harshness I have to enforce them with?

1g11b2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/mtwhitney/comments/1g11b2f/trip_report_whitney_portal_and_cottonwood_lakes/,Trip Report: Whitney Portal and Cottonwood Lakes Trail to Cirque Lake,"Hi all,

**TL:DR**

**Stayed in Whitney Portal for one night.  Site 24.  Good for two large tents**  
**Giant pancakes awesome as usual.**  
**Cottonwood Lakes Trail in great condition.**    
**Hiked to Cirque Lake using the South Fork Cottonwood Creek Trail.**  
**About 5 miles one-way.**

**Details for those interested:**

Took my son and Max, the Husky, on a planned 3 day backpacking trip to Cottonwood Lakes.  We also planned on spending a night at Whitney Portal so my son could experience the giant pancake first hand, and also to help with acclimation.  Not sure if it actually helps, but is a good reason to visit the Portal and eat some good food and see the sights.

We stayed in site 24.  Great site albeit a bit close to the bathroom so you'd get that vault toilet smell now and then.  Not awful, but noticeable.  Room enough for two large tents in this site.  Pulling straight in to the parking spot would be easy.  As most people seem to do, we backed in.  Not difficult but, because of the narrow-ish road, you have to be a bit careful.

The site was clean and ready for our arrival and the bathrooms were clean.

Some people had fires going.  We did not.  Wood was $9/ bundle.  As we drove by, I noticed a sign that said ""Host Day Off"".  I assume firewood is on the honor system.

Spent the night there.  In the morning, we shared a pancake (realistically, they'd feed 5 or 6 people), coffee and hot chocolate and drove up to the Cottonwood Lakes Trailhead.  Got changed and headed out.  First (and only) stop was Cirque Lake.  About 5 miles in if you take the South Fork Cottonwood Creek Trail- which is a great trail, but don't spread it around.  It'll be our little secret.

Cirque Lake was amazing (I'd been there once before).  We were the only ones there.  Such a neat place to spend some time.  We had planned on going to Muir Lake next and then another camp TBD for the third night.  

For (reasons), I decided to hike out the next morning and head back home. Still a great time and I'm sure we'll be back.

Temps were maybe 50-55 during the daytime hike in and mid 30's overnight.  About what [weather.gov](http://weather.gov) predicted.  Mountain-Forecast, as usual, didn't seem accurate.  Not to mention, I have no idea why their Max/ Min temps are only a few degrees off.

Any questions, feel free to ask.

- my Apple watch that gently taps my wrist to wake me up seconds before my nag of a phone destroys the silence with an air raid/duck n cover alarm

- my fabulous home office coffee bar I made from an old desk. My shiny Nespresso machine is primed and ready to caffeinate me all day long

- I'm grateful for my soft fuzzy socks. They help me pretend it's a TV land Fall season here when it's 98 degrees outside and I'm sweating in my pumpkin spiced latte.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[\(well, yeah, but with other news too\)](https://preview.redd.it/8p0dss0qt1ud1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4967d19e487d7c3729d8224320f9a175ffb25c16)

&#x200B;

Well after my last news post (GOG, Epic, emulation all on the Steam Deck), [which you can find here if you'd like to read it](https://new.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1fzil7x/steam_deck_news_post_gog_epic_emulation_and_gaming/) I thought I might jump in on the next one early!

&#x200B;

As with the last, and as ever with older ones I‚Äôve posted elsewhere on reddit, these are just...my attempt to make fun game posts in the (attempted) style of the old gaming blogs I was never around to see, and the old gaming sites I wish I was around to read regularly. It‚Äôs JUST meant to be fun ‚Äì lots of images and GIF‚Äôs, lots of news and games which have caught my eye. Or my attempt at all of that anyway!

After chatting with the (new) mod team here, I‚Äôve got it sorted that I‚Äôll post these weekly from now on. So that‚Äôs nice!

Just a word of warning though, this will be... *very* long and detailed. I have no ability to stop myself typing way too much, so read on only if you have a cup of tea or coffee handy (and some time!) <3

# GOG AND KINGDOM COME

&#x200B;

I wanted to mention ""Kingdom Come: Deliverance"" and the recent (unfortunate) news surrounding it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/32yatwn5k1ud1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc83e43d78f7cbb655f7fd13a7e52e69244594a6

KCD has become a favorite among gamers. I was ever aware of it but only recently dove in, quickly becoming both sucked into, and then quickly overwhelmed by its expansive world (this game is DETAILED!).

KCD feels to me like the perfect melting pot-blend of a medieval history library and bits from (or reminding you of!) Skyrim, The Witcher, Mount & Blade II, and Dark Souls‚Äîespecially in its unforgiving combat; you gotta stay aware of your surroundings and mechanics at all times.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/wam13ulck1ud1.gif

It‚Äôs arguably the most historically accurate simulation of medieval life, set in early 15th-century Bohemia with what felt to me like the world‚Äôs biggest in-game world. You start as a character with no reading skills, combat experience, or fitness, which felt to me like a true learning curve (and definition) of a simulation. For such a sim-like ‚ÄòRPG‚Äô, it has significant love online, especially for its horses, swords, and setting. It currently holds a ""Very Positive"" rating on Steam, with over 103,000 reviews.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vp3ks15ek1ud1.gif

But, we sadly saw a day or so ago that KCD (which has been available on GOG since day one) will have Denuvo DRM added to it for the upcoming sequel. So? Not going to be listed or sold on GOG.

I‚Äôll get into what Denuvo DRM is next up, for anyone unaware, but having a game which was *so* incredible outspoken about being on GOG for their first release, and being all for gamers not having DRM (the dev team actually printed out the NFO for the first game and hung it up in their office), this is just a heavy bit of news.

Their studio, Warhorse, were bought by Plaion, which in turn is owned by the (notorious) Embracer Group, so it‚Äôs not so hard to see who is behind this decision. Suits. Still? Sad news in the GOG field to start with.

Sadly the announcement *has* been made official, but if you want a lil more of a peek, you can see even Steam Curators ([like this one here!](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/26095454-Denuvo-Games/?appid=1771300)) have it listed as a Denuvo title.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# NOW FOR ANYONE WHO DOESN‚ÄôT KNOW WHAT ABOUT GOG AND DENUVO:

&#x200B;

**DENUVO:**

Denuvo DRM is a digital rights management technology designed to protect video games from \[illegal sharing\] by limiting unauthorized access and copying ‚Äì it protects the game against \[illegal stuff\]. Obviously it‚Äôs intended to safeguard developers' interests, but many PC gamers criticize it for several reasons.

&#x200B;

* Denuvo can lead to performance issues,
* increased load times,
* even crashes in some cases.

Additionally, its presence often restricts legitimate users, making it harder to access and play their purchased games. This has caused frustration among gamers who feel that the measures taken to prevent \[illegal stuff\] ultimately hinder the very people supporting the game.

Denuvo DRM is now...everywhere. Well...almost everywhere.

GOG themselves are proudly 'DRM-Free': Denuvo and everything else, it‚Äôs a blanket statement ‚Äì they are DRM free (and I know some of you there are furiously getting ready to type about GOG and Hitman...we‚Äôll forget that one)

GOG believe that when you purchase a PC game from them it will have no digital rights management - that when you buy your game, you own it forever, not locked to a platform or storefront. This boils down to:

    ‚Ä¢ Ownership and Control - you won't need to verify your ownership via an online connection regularly (RDR2, I'm looking at you via Steam for abusing this concept the worst), nor will you need a separate account or launcher to play
    ‚Ä¢ Playing Offline - DRM-free games never require you to be online
    ‚Ä¢ No 'client' dependency - unlike Steam, you don't need a client to play GOG games, you can play them directly
    ‚Ä¢ Performance Benefits - it is no secret that something like Denuvo will impact performance on your game. There's no overhead from anti-[illegalstuff] checks to slow anything down

When you buy a GOG game, you can download it, store it wherever you want, and nothing will ever stop you playing it.

# GOG FORUMS:

&#x200B;

Another thing to keep in mind (just before I get to showing off the fun stuff: games from GOG on the Steam Deck!), if you have a Prime Gaming acc, and redeem them on GOG, then your GOG acc will also give you access to the GOG forums.

There‚Äôs a mix of thing to find there: nonsense ‚Äòforum games‚Äô, but amongst that you get a ton of great news, give-aways, codes, GOG themselves post in there, developers discussing their games, new games, updates, and entire sub-forums on your fav franchises. I‚Äôve just grabbed a lil collage of some of some which caught my eye, to give you an idea :)

&#x200B;

[\(my collage may not be pretty, but it IS...well its a collage of gray\)](https://preview.redd.it/njosi2n1l1ud1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37b45b88de448aacc9f355a11e5278aec52e8a2c)

# GOG UPDATES OF INTEREST:

&#x200B;

I've seen a few interesting GOG games updated in the last few days, but I won't do much with this, just some dot-points for the ones which I love most:

&#x200B;

* [BREACHWAY](https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/06/10/09/Battlestar-Galactica_0.jpg) (updated 1 day ago)
* [DREDGE](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/31/99/1a/31991a0d6e5f1ad1fb19057252f6c0a7.jpg) (my absolute fav Steam Deck game ever!!!!!!) (updated also 1 day ago)
* [Trinity: Fusion](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/68/d2/1f/68d21f25ec657f4599fc6db07c8a93e3.gif) (a super fun mix of Metroid + John Carpenter-ish music) (also updated 1 day ago)
* [Ghost Runner II](https://www.amalgamatedmovies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-ninjas-kick-back-pic-683x1024.jpg) (updated 3 days ago now)

# GOG GAMES:

&#x200B;

This week we got one great, great game from Prime Gaming‚Äôs weekly giveaway ‚Äì you can go here to read more about it and see what they‚Äôre offering for your subscription if you want: [https://gaming.amazon.com/intro](https://gaming.amazon.com/intro)

&#x200B;

This week‚Äôs BIG giveaway from Prime though?  Was Bioshock!

&#x200B;

[\(this week's giveaways!\)](https://preview.redd.it/yk2nubxhl1ud1.png?width=2017&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0f33b8a84f97bc8a3b131b66dda949f746e0c9f)

# GAMES FROM GOG I HAVE ENJOYED

\~ I figured I'd go into the teeny-tiniest amount of detail on a few games I've played and loved on GOG recently, it's nothing hard-hitting, not a review, just my recommendations of a half-handful of games I've had a great time playing on my Steam Deck!

&#x200B;

^(the spooky month edition!)

&#x200B;

**BIOSHOCK:**

This week‚Äôs free game from Prime Gaming is Bioshock: Remastered! This one is SUPER exciting to me, since I adore Bioshock (like 99% of you here I‚Äôm sure!), though the third game, Infinite, is maybe my fav of the trilogy (like 2% of you here, I‚Äôm also sure!), and it‚Äôs so nice to see such big titles ‚Äì regardless of their age, being given away!

&#x200B;

[\(ART DECO\)](https://preview.redd.it/l86tafful1ud1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e3bdcc34288cd8c76eac5e05ff7eccf71ed7721)

I don‚Äôt think I need to even write a LITTLE on why Bioshock is one of the greatest games made, and best of all it aged really well.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/lmhqiqdwl1ud1.gif

And it‚Äôs NOT just a horror game. You‚Äôve got heavy themes like the very nature of choice and free will, the idea of a Utopia built and fallen, the consequence of extreme individualism in a man-made and crafted society. The Art Deco setting made my design-heart fall in love: ornate architecture with its geometric shapes being ruined by a life underwater? UGH PERFECTION. Play this game right now! Claim it, and play it, I promise you it will make you fall in love.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TRANSISTOR:**

This was one I stumbled on. I had it in my GOG library from some sale-or-other, but had never given it a try! Another user asked if I could help get the settings right to have it run (it required nothing special, and turns out that other user had the Epic version, while I had GOG), and after that I got very, very sucked in to the game.

[\(tron meets The Great Gatsby meets Cyberpunk\)](https://preview.redd.it/6yl3bwwsq1ud1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=12fd425af6d62614888e9334447e706475a1f973)

Much like Bioshock, it is steeped in the Art Deco aesthetic, mixed entirely with cyberpunk. It's like if the 1920's had a party, and invited Johnny Silverhand.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/pquszqd1r1ud1.gif

You play as Red, a pretty and famous singer who drags around a sword which would make Cloud in FF7 blush for having one which will never compare. This was developed by the devs behind Hades, and you can tell they have an enormous talent for designing deep games with a great (and fun!) loop.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**GRAVEYARD KEEPER:**

Graveyard Keeper: Think Stardew Valley, but in a graveyard. You're a modern-day gentleman who gets transported to an odd medieval world where you're in charge of running the spot where people are...buried. It's a srsly fun game, with the typical 'farm-games' style resource management, but with a dark, dark, daaaark twist:

&#x200B;

[\(more satisfying than I like to admit\)](https://i.redd.it/pw0m4a4yl1ud1.gif)

The graphics and animations are just beautiful, and the game plays incredibly well on the Steam Deck (much like games like DREDGE, or Hades, this one feels 'made for' the Steam Deck). It's on sale on GOG at the moment, and not on sale on Steam. It's 75% off

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/qc7dna40m1ud1.gif

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**DARKEST DUNGEON 2:**

&#x200B;

Admittedly not perfect, but for what it is? I have had a BLAST playing it. A gothic horror styled roguelike RPG, it‚Äôs turn-based and a bit of a dungeon crawling. What grabbed me is the art style, yet another ‚Äòhand-drawn‚Äô game that utilize a kind of watercolor/ink look ‚Äì everything is forbidding, eerie with almost everything in heavy blacks, reds and muted tones. This game just...made me scared, in the best way! (and I‚Äôm a girl who HATES horror and being scared!!!)

&#x200B;

[\(the in-between battles is a fun cart-racer!!! ...well, a cart driver?\)](https://i.redd.it/hpmlbw42m1ud1.gif)

‚ÄúDarkest Dungeon II is a rogue-like road trip of the damned. Form a party, equip your stagecoach, and set off across the decaying landscape on a last gasp quest to avert the apocalypse. The greatest dangers you face, however, may come from within‚Ä¶‚Äù

To me it‚Äôs just...fun. A nice dark RPG - you get to lead a group of 'heroes' on a dark journey through an even darker world (gothic af, truly), and for those who enjoy the challenge -  it has some brutal things to keep track of (player health, mental fortitude, psychological stress etc) - and permadeath!

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/mxk2xb56m1ud1.gif

It was also updated on GOG just 29 days ago, so the devs are keeping things fresh, supported and extended. I really recommend this one!

&#x200B;

# OTHER GOG NEWS-Y THINGS:

&#x200B;

**GOGDB -**

[https://www.gogdb.org/](https://www.gogdb.org/)

GOG Database is a good site to keep in mind, for any kind of reference. GOGdb collects data from the store and Galaxy APIs and makes it accessible on a single page for each game. It started as a tool for developers, but slowly evolved into a tool for all kinds of GOG enthusiasts. As the name suggests, this project has been heavily inspired by Steam Database, you should definitely check them out if you're a Steam user who is curious on GOG.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**COMMAND & CONQUER:**

&#x200B;

There are hints and guessed that some C&C game (or games?) might be coming to GOG soon. Red Alert 2 was touted as being DRM free on Steam as it is, but some errors pop up when I try that one

* To mark the release of Resident Evil, GoG organized an AMA on Reddit. In response to a question (""if you could work in ANY classic videogame to bring it back to modern systems, what game would it be? ""), here's part of the answer of Maciej Go≈Çƒôbiewski ‚Äì GOG‚Äôs Managing Director :

[When it comes to games I‚Äôd like to see on GOG it‚Äôs C&C: Red Alert 2 - Yuri's Revenge :) I really believe that Command & Conquer: The Ultimate Collection will make its way to GOG one day, mark my words! :)](https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1dsqsh6/comment/lb9u2hd/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1dsqsh6/comment/lb9u2hd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1dsqsh6/comment/lb9u2hd/)

Clearly this is a lot of hope, and not much evidence, but...we‚Äôll let the dream continue for some :)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TOMB RAIDER:**

&#x200B;

If you‚Äôre a fan of the Tomb Raider games on GOG (the 2013 Tomb Riader, Underworld, I-III Remastered, Anniversary, Legend and more) then you might be excited to see the anime series made by Netflix is now here!

# A LITTLE EPIC NEWS:

&#x200B;

Again, let me reiterate that finding positive Epic Games news? It‚Äôs...a struggle! But I found out that:

&#x200B;

* There is talk that there may be patch notes for games on their store in the future (yes, such a feature still does not exist) ‚Äì found in the EOS and EGS documentation.
* Red Dead Redemption will be available on the store, and will feature 51 Epic Achievements
* One of next weeks‚Äô game is Killing Floor 2 (from the weekly Prime Gaming giveaways)
* October 24th brings STATIS: BONE TOTEM (from Prime Gaming)
* October 24th ALSO gives away Morbid: The Seven Acolytes
* October 31st gives you Death‚Äôs Door (one of my fav games on the Steam Deck!!) and again (Prime Gaming)
* Next week‚Äôs freebie on Epic themselves (NOT a Prime Gaming bonus!) is Atom Eve. Though you may have already redeemed this, unless you‚Äôre new to the process. It has been given out twice before this.
* Next week‚Äôs OTHER freebie is Kardboard Kings (which has been a giveaway on Prime Gaming some time back)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**EPIC CHRISTMAS?**

Each Christmas we get a-game-a-day to redeem during the month, typically in the past it has been 15 of them, but last year we got 17 games in total.

This may however be the last Christmas we see this giveaway. The original plan by Epic was to end their giveaway program in 2024, so...it‚Äôs unsure whether due to their recent statement about better financials they may extend the program, or the rumors (which are just rumors) that it may turn into a subscription might come true.

Time will tell, but my feeling is that it won‚Äôt be ending.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# THE PRIME GIVEAWAYS:

[You can find the entire list of Prime Gaming giveaways listed here, if you want to see what is available, still available from before, and soon-to-be available!](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-members-get-these-28-free-games-in-october/1100-6527079/)

# WHAT I USE TO PLAY GOG AND EPIC ON THE STEAM DECK:

&#x200B;

So this is one of two options you can use to play your GOG and Epic Games‚Äô games on your Steam Deck. There ARE more options, yes, but since I‚Äôm writing this and it‚Äôs...my opinions, these are the two I recommend most after testing them all!

&#x200B;

**Heroic:**

I asked Linguin (hi Linguin!!!) if he had any news to share about Heroic, and he told me:

* They are going to be at Ubuntu Summit this year! [https://ubuntu.com/summit](https://ubuntu.com/summit)  and almost everyone involved in UMU will attend!

&#x200B;

* And he wanted me to share that ‚Äúthis is a wiki page for game developers who are willing to target Linux native builds on GOG, in regards to SDK, which GOG claims doesn't work on Linux, I beg to differ however‚Äù [https://github.com/imLinguin/comet/wiki/For-Game-Developers](https://github.com/imLinguin/comet/wiki/For-Game-Developers)

&#x200B;

* Also, I might consider moderating the teeny-tiny sub-reddit for Heroic: r/HeroicGamesLaumcher . I love what the Heroic team does, and stand by the developers love for Linux (and the Steam Deck!). I‚Äôve reached out to the single mod there some time ago (hi u/Dymonika !!) on the sub, but haven‚Äôt heard back.

&#x200B;

***You can find Heroic here***: [https://heroicgameslauncher.com/](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/)

***You can find their Discord here***: [https://discord.com/invite/rHJ2uqdquK](https://discord.com/invite/rHJ2uqdquK)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**JUNK STORE:**

&#x200B;

* It seems like Junk Store is the first plugin from Decky to have been accepted on Steam, and to have its own Steam page. This is a huge step, and nice to see the developer having some (limited) contact with Valve themselves!
* You can read their post announcing this on their sub-reddit, at r/JunkStore

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# EMULATION:

&#x200B;

I can‚Äôt really find much to chat about in regards to emulation, but a few interesting points:

&#x200B;

* **RetroDECK** has a regular blog you can use to stay up-to-date with them on their progression and emulation suite [https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blog/2024/10/03/october-2024-spooky-lights/](https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blog/2024/10/03/october-2024-spooky-lights/) is the latest blog post they made (on the 4th of this month!)

&#x200B;

* One nice thing to see four or five days ago was the RetroDECK developer Xargon confirming that they are going to update Ryujinx to the latest version for users, and will not be removing it from the Deck. It‚Äôs not super surprising, since this was a voluntary shut-down by Ruijinx‚Äôs dev, whereas Yuzu was legal. Just good to see confirmation it will continue to be there.

&#x200B;

* A few days ago there was a new release of the OTHER Switch emulator called **Sudachi**. The v1.0.10 release has come up, for Windows, Android and now Linux! The listing states: ""Nintendo Switch emulation without the iffy bits and support for more games"" ‚Äì these ‚Äòiffy bits‚Äô were portions of code Nintendo was able to use to pursue Yuzu, and ultimately shut it down.
* [https://sudachi.emuplace.app/](https://sudachi.emuplace.app/) is the site where you can find the Sudachi builds!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# FINALLY?

&#x200B;

That‚Äôs it!

Sorry it was such a long, long, long post. I just wanted to share more of the interesting and fun stuff I have spotted.

&#x200B;

As ever, keep in mind these are all my own opinions, my preferred games written about, preferred programs I use, preferred over-abundance of GIFs (I love them!).

&#x200B;

This is also going to have a custom flair applied (I‚Äôve been chatting to the mods about that, but my own suggestions for that flair are...not great, so keep an eye out for that I guess?), and I aim to have this kind of post a weekly thing.

I like to time it around the giveaway games from Epic and Prime (GOG), because tbh this is one of my fav days of the week ‚Äì its so fun seeing what‚Äôs given away, and how it plays on my Steam Deck!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I do hope someone here finds something interesting, and of course not all of this news about what I played on GOG is specific *to GOG.*

On the one hand I don't want to spend a lot of money, but I'd like fine ground coffee. The Kingrinder P2 offers Espresso level grind, but I've heard mixed reviews (from James' video as well). A turkish copper grinder offers much more fine ground but often without the consistency of a modern espresso grinder design. I can get both of those for around $45 USD. A Kingrinder K-Series would cost me double but offer much better consistency and product.

So my question: Is the extra money really worth it? If so how high should I go in the K-Series? And if not is a copper grinder going to be enough?

I felt the need to share because I‚Äôm always seeing huge success stories but my progress has been rather slow.

I do want to note that I was on Lexapro until a week ago too, which is known to lessen the effects of GLP-1, which I was unaware of. I had to spend a month tapering off Lexapro and I‚Äôm currently dealing with withdrawal from that.

Anyway, my GLP-1 has helped A TON with how much I can eat and drink. Before I started I was drinking a pot of coffee daily with creamer as well as snacking all day. Now I can hardly finish a single cup of coffee, and I‚Äôm not entirely sure why. Coffee, and food generally, is just less attractive than it used to be.

It has been disappointing to lose my weight slower than virtually all other success stories here but I do have a 6 month supply and I will reach my goal despite the slower progress. One positive is that losing weight at a slower pace can reduce the chance of gaining weight back later.

If you‚Äôre in the same boat as me, share here too! It helps knowing we aren‚Äôt alone.

1g10tux,https://www.reddit.com/r/attitudinalpsyche/comments/1g10tux/questionnaire_results_first_typing/,Questionnaire Results (First Typing),"***L (logic)***

**How much time and energy do you spend researching or studying? Do you like researching and studying, and why?**

I spend a lot of time studying, and researching, for the most part. In regard to studying, I get stressed out towards an exam, often trying to achieve the highest result out of my peers. This leads to me constantly worrying about whether or not I'm prepared enough. I wouldn't say I like or dislike it. Sure, I'd rather be doing something fun, but at the same time, I know if I were to procrastinate, I'd feel impending doom.

**How many of your own opinions do you form? How often do you do actual thinking on your own, more than just finding an existing answer?**

I'd say I do form my own opinions, but at times, the opinions of those close to me (i.e. parents) would affect how I display my opinions. If they differ, I will likely go along with my parents, whilst keeping mine to myself.

I would definitely say though, that I form my own on different matters. In the same sense, I do most of my thinking alone, however, in terms of creativity wise, I look for inspiration.

**How often do you talk about concepts or facts? Why exactly do you talk about it, and what do you like talking about most?**

I'd say quite often. Probably not as much as I'd like even. I love teaching and explaining concepts and procedures (i.e. mathematics) to others. It just fills me with energy and enjoyment, being able to share my knowledge with others.

I like talking about concepts, and relating them to real life moments, or being able to explain a phenomenon using my knowledge.

**Do you struggle with thinking about things by yourself? Does this bother you, and how much?**

I don't have trouble at all with thinking about things by myself. At least, not intangible things. Maybe if we're taking about fixing a car, or cooking, in such areas I'd struggle.

Besides that, I was always (respectfully, lol) ahead of my peers in the intellectual aspect; from a young age I was told my observation, deduction, and inferencing skills were above those my age. I excel in mathematics and sciences as I'm easily able to see the broader picture, application, and the workings of theories.

In the same sense, after being shown an example (as well as the procedure or thought process of solving a problem) I can easily apply the skills to much harder degree questions.

At times, it bothers me when others can't think for themselves. Problem A arises, and they don't have it in them to adapt, or even try to think up a solution.

**How well do you handle criticism from others when it comes to your logical concepts or factual knowledge?**

I wouldn't say I'd take it negatively personally, rather, I'd hate to think other people are more informed than I am, or that they've found my knowledge to be incorrect. I'd feel ashamed of myself, but wouldn't harbour negativity towards this person. Often, when I am providing a solution I tend to say, ""But I think it's wrong..."" or ""I don't think I'm right..."" to ensure that there are no expectations people hold towards my knowledge. I'd hate to come across as someone who thinks they're right, propagate that they are, when in actual fact, they're wrong.

***E (emotion)***

**Do you consider yourself a creative person? What do you do that's creative?**

Maybe? Creative in what sense?

I used to be really good at art as a kid, when I got older I slacked off. Often, I'd be really adept at knowing what appeals artistically. I'd understand that certain colour concepts were unfitted with one another, etc. In the same sense, I was a power house when it came to making posters, digital media, and PowerPoints, far more advanced and appealing than those my age.

Really, anything I did had to be the best.

I'm quite adept at solving problems using outside of the box thinking. I can use the resources and materials around me quite well, often as a kid I solved most of the issues that arose (e.g. brick fence is lent over/collapsing).

**How do you feel about expressing your own emotions? Are emotions part of your decision-making at all? How much of a role do they play in your decisions?**

I don't like expressing my own emotions. It feels wrong, imposing them on other people.  I must say, I try to remain happy and positive, hating the thought that others would ever see me cry, be agitated, or angry.

I'd say I consider the feelings of others over my own in terms of decision-making. As a kid, I'd often not want to participate in things, but would consider the impact that would have on my parents (who wanted me to), hence leading to me engaging in said activity. I also hate the thought of disappointing someone; back in high school I was in this training academy, and felt sick. I didn't want to leave, as I felt my coach, whom I looked up to dearly, would be disappointed. After I ended up leaving ill, it plagued me all day.

**How much effort do you put into creating a positive emotional influence on other people? Do you try to do this at all? Do you like exploring the emotions or creativity of others?**

A lot of effort. I don't want to make anybody uncomfortable, or have anyone getting upset over something I have done. It's just repulsive for me, I feel awkward and imposing otherwise. I'm also not the best at consoling, I feel awkward saying, ""Are you okay?"" and comforting someone. I'm not sure why it feels so foreign, and makes me cringe almost, even if I feel for this person.

**Do you feel uncomfortable with the idea of sharing your emotions? Do you struggle with knowing exactly how to connect with others on a deeper and more emotional level? Do you struggle with knowing how to go about dealing with and handling your emotions?**

Yes, I do feel uncomfortable sharing my emotions. As often as I can, I try to avoid it. It feels wrong imposing them on others, like I'm forcing them to be uncomfortable themselves.

I do struggle to connect. At times, it often comes down to initiation and knowing how to respond in conversation. In this sense, when I'm meeting someone new, I'll constantly be trying to predict what they're going to say, as I struggle to react in the moment. I also fear that when I'm with others, my presence is annoying. It's a problem, I must admit. I also assume that people find me annoying when I can't do something perfectly, which is completely wrong.

One thing I must admit, is that if someone states my emotional state, it's a lot harder to hide. Back to the training academy example, there was a time where I was extremely anxious before a competition which had caused me to mess up in warm-up. A coach pulled me over and said, ""You're anxious, aren't you? It's okay, it's natural."" Or something along the lines. It made me get emotional (I hid this of course) that they noticed, I'm not sure why I react this way. It's the same when someone tells me I feel a certain way about something, without having said anything. I don't particularly like them speaking on my behalf, per say?

I must say, if you ask anyone who knows me, they'd just say I'm happy, polite, and friendly. Maybe a tad bit shy. I feel like my descriptions of myself tend to visualise this stoic, competitive, driven, commander. I am not that at all.

***F (physics / foundation)***

**How much time and energy do you put into your physical health? Do you try new healthcare or self-care products often? How often, and what kinds of products do you like trying?**

It depends. If I'm not planning on going out anywhere, I'll put very little effort into hygiene and whatnot. If I'm planning on going out and seeing people, I could take hours getting ready.

I wouldn't say I try new healthcare or self-care products too often. Maybe if the packaging appeals to me, or it's commonly used I might try it out.

**How much do you care about your physical appearance, including fashion choices, or decorating the physical environment for comfort? Do you like exploring the physical environment (food, nature, architecture, etc), or doing physical activity?**

I care about others opinions of how I look. It is a source of anxiety at times, I must admit. It also poses the issue of self confidence. I may buy articles of clothing, to never wear them as I lack the confidence, or fear criticism too much. I'm not that experimental with fashion, rather simple, yet 'trendy'.

I like to decorate my physical environment to my liking, what appeals to me. I have a huge case of lego and figurines, as well as an abundance of soft cushions and plushies that have appealed to me. I'm not money savvy in that sense.

I have little tolerance when it comes to the physical realm, for instance, tiring out during physical activity. I don't have much drive to push myself to the point it forces me to be uncomfortable, however, it really all depends on who is around me. If I want to impress someone, sure, I'll try to push myself, but alone, I often quit.

**Do you like talking about your personal tastes often? How often do you explore the personal tastes of others? What about your own health or the health of others? Do you like creating or exploring comfortable environments with others?**

I feel responsible for creating a comfortable environment for others emotionally, maybe not so much physically. I am certainly conscious of how my physical environment might be interpreted, and often worry about receiving criticism (e.g., I have a poster of something, and a guest considers the content weird).

I wouldn't say I'm exploratory with others tastes in the sense that I don't go out of my way to get them to try new things, or ponder deeply into their tastes. Their tastes are their tastes, you do you, in a way.

I'm not that invested in learning about others healthcare or personal tastes. Sure, I'd certainly take note if it's someone important to me, but otherwise, I really could care less.

Personally, once again, I'm not that comfortable with sharing personal tastes, in fear of being judged.

**Do you stress about what people will think regarding your personal tastes? Do you prefer to follow fashion trends in worry that people may judge your own style? Do you worry about being sick or in poor physical health often? Are you able to take criticism about your health, aesthetic choices, personal tastes, or physical appearance?**

Yes. I used to be very conscious of how others might judge my physical appearance, environment, etc. As a kid, this was even more obvious. I tried to organise a party once, but was too concerned over every little detail (e.g. our home fence didn't fit the 'aesthetic', per say).

Sometimes I may, for an instance, worry about whether or not I'm exhibiting symptoms for something greater but these aren't continuous thoughts. As a teenager, I was that kid who'd often try to associate themselves with something (e.g. synesthesia).

***V (volition)***

**Do you know how to get what you want? How much effort do you put into figuring out how to get what you want? Do you just take action and get started, do you plan, do you research or try to get advice from others?**

I just want to best, or rather, I don't want to be incompetent or pinned as someone who isn't perfect. In this means, I put much thought into the things I do, e.g. projects, academic work, etc. Often, this lead me to be someone far out from my peers in terms of ability.

I find it hard at times to figure out what I want, often worrying more about how my decision is going to be interpreted by others, and whether or not I stress about disappointing them. I think this worry came from growing up around a parental figure who, at times would react harshly to the decisions I made, despite reassuring me it was my choice.

I've seen this example used often, so I'll use it now; if I were going to be buying a car, my main concern would be whether I like the look of it or not. Second, would be the opinion of others. I'd take someone I trust, say my father, with me to purchase the vehicle, where he can then offer his opinion on whether it is good in terms of practical aspects. If my father doesn't like the car, despite it appealing me, I would certainly struggle with decision making.

I wouldn't say I do much research or search for advice from others, I haven't really done this.

**How often do you feel motivated to work on your future? How often are you busy working on a goal for the future? Do you prefer routine, or often fall into routine? Is your routine making progress on a goal? What makes you change your routine? What makes you start working on a goal?**

I wouldn't say I set goals as such, rather, I have a desired outcome of coming out on top. During stress, I often set out a study plan. Do I often stick to this religiously? No. But it slightly eases my stress when I'm able to visualise and imagine how I am planning on studying, ensuring I have enough time to get through the material.

I must say, I may often fall into small routine habits, for example, how I make my coffee. Using the same cup, spoon, following the same process (e.g., sliding the instant coffee jar to it's usual spot. Opening it using the spoon on the same side as always, etc.).

I don't change these habits often, and if they're interrupted, I can get slightly irritated (I hide this irritation, less so with family).

I must emphasise that this desire to be the best is not at all externally visible. I'm sure even my closest friends are still unaware of how much I rely on coming out on top.

**Do you like guiding or helping people reach their goals? What kinds of goals do you prefer to help people with? Are you a leader, or do you prefer to work in groups where you're an equal? How and when do you take charge, if ever?**

I used to imagine myself, when I was a kid, being a coach, and helping a player be the best they can be. I enjoy teaching and sharing my knowledge, so naturally I'd picture it. Though, this does not apply to everyone. I could care less about some peoples goals, in fact, I'm not that pinned on goal setting.

I have the desire to lead, and organise the development of a solution or project, but often lack the confidence to actually do so.

I enjoy group work when its with people I like, if not, I'm quite picky with how I like things down, having a higher standard and expectation compared to others, so often work better independently in that sense.

**Do you overwork yourself? Do you worry that you might be lazy or that you aren't progressing quickly enough? Does it feel impossible to find the right method forward? Are you able to take criticism over your choices for working towards your goals? How do you respond to being challenged?**

Yes, yes, yes. I'm told I overwork myself, not sure. But I certainly worry that I might be lazy, and that this will cause problems later down the track. Say, if an exam is upcoming and I choose to relax, I most certainly will be antsy.

It would depend on who exactly is critiquing me. If I value their opinion on me, then it would completely throw me off. I'd have a nagging feeling like I'm going against them.

In regard to responding to challenge, it would depend, once again. I wouldn't get competitive externally, there might be some internal drive, but I may be put off and retreat.

I've been told I exhibit some signs attributed to autism, but I haven't been medically diagnosed, nor would I agree or disagree.

Used to have anxiety back in high school, I've worked hard to improve myself in that sense, so it's a lot better.

I bought decants from u/svk43 and u/mebankai. u/svk43 has a massive collection of fragrances, if you want it he probably has it. u/mebankai does cost to cost decanting - one of the cheapest sellers I've found on this sub recently.

I bought full bottles from Rinni Bansal's store.

  
**Reviews**

**Lomani Best** - Spicy. Distinct notes of pepper. Dry down is sweet. Lasts 5-6 hours on clothes, projection is for 1 hour.

I received it as a gift many years ago. Currently it goes for 20 dollars. Pretty worth it.

**Dunhill Icon** - Fresh and spicy. Combines citrus with spice to come up with a unique scent profile. Lasts 4-5 hours on clothes, projects for half an hour.

Good for college/office use. It won't offend anyone and you'll still smell fresh. Its got a really special scent, I like it a lot. Too bad it doesn't last too long.

**Lattafa Ameer Al Oudh Intense** - Sweet. Very sweet. Too sweet. Very warm too. Lasts 10+ hours on clothes, and projects strongly for the first 2 hours.

Don't use it too much on yourself, it's strong enough to kill a small animal.

**Mancera Melody of The Sun** - Floral, sweet. It's like being amidst a field of flowers. Lasts 3-4 hours on clothes. Projects for the first 20 minutes.

They've cooked with this one. I like it a lot. An ideal after-shower perfume.

**Mancera Cedrat Boise Intense** - Leathery and woody. Very masculine smelling. Lasts 6-7 hours on clothes, projects for the first hour.

Good scent. Approved.

**Aqua Di Gio Parfum** - Aquatic (sort of).

Ass. Straight ass. How is this popular? It tries to imitate the freshness of water but it smells like a pond mosquitoes would breed in. To me it reeks of rot and decay.

**Theoreme ‚Äì** Fresh, citrusy. I avoid applying it on my skin, it has caused rashes. Haven‚Äôt tested it enough to talk about projection.

Very cheap. You‚Äôll end up smelling a citrus fruit for the next couple of hours. Quality of the perfume base might not be *that* good, it also may be that my skin is sensitive to it.

**Mancera Coffee Amore ‚Äì** A coffee based perfume.

Smells like what it says on the tin. Sweet, very coffee like and warm. I love the smell.

**Givenchy Reserve Privee ‚Äì** Boozy and sweet. Lasts for 8 hours, projects for the first hour or two.

I accidently sprayed GPR six times on my shirt. 3 spots, twice on each spot. I smelled like a middle-aged British aristocrat (or at least what I imagine they smell like) for the entire day and the next day in the morning. Good.

**Valentino Uomo Intense ‚Äì** GPR, but sweeter and less boozy. Similar lasting power and projection.

Nothing much to add here, prefer GPR more.

**Special Mention**

**Fraganote Citrus Amber ‚Äì** Smells exactly like Theoreme (a Bvlgari Tygar clone), lasts for a quarter of the time, costs double the price and the Fraganote website deletes most reviews which are not more than 4 stars, so most comments don‚Äôt reflect their subpar quality.

Ass. Straight ass. Made a rookie mistake buying this.

I'm new to Reddit, and this seems like a great place for community research/insight. If you have the time and space to engage with this work at any capacity, thank you. Please do so at your leisure with zero urgency to respond straight away. Rest Well.



**Personal Background:**

* I am a striking 37yo, large bodied, femme presenting Vocalist, Yogi, and Rest Advocate. 
* I'm from California, attended an HBCU in Louisiana, where I met my husband of 18 years. 
* I have worked in Michelin Star restaurants and fine dining rooms as a Maitre'd for 5 years; a slight detour from my role as an coffee and olive oil importer. 
* My husband and I were grown-ass, consenting Jehovah's Witnesses for 10 years before we decided it was weird, and had to go. 
* I have a flip phone, and don't use social media. At all. I used to, but I've been clean for 3 years. 
* I lived in D.C. for 12 years before moving to Phoenix on Christmas Day 2020. 
* Navigating a new city without GPS is an adventure-and-a-half.  
* I recently returned to school to study Art/Architecture. I'm proud to report that I. Am. ***Crushing***. 

  
**The Work Situation:**

* Well designed, nationally recognized fine-dining concept in my neighborhood; it opened a few months before The Lockdown, and has managed to do well somehow. 
* Only 5 of my coworkers have consent to text my flip phone. That's how I would prefer it in this situation. We are ***not*** the same. 
* Out of 40 employees, there are three of Us: 1) me- The Maitre'd, 2) Ms. Willa, our lovely Dishwasher, and 3) Wrex, a problematic Bartender. 
* This is the first restaurant that I've ever heard of that doesn't operate with managers. You heard me: NO. MANAGER. The owners of the business are aware that this is chaotic, are very present in the space, but also avoidant enablers. Some:

***""It's an autonomous workspace until we can find the perfect person that'll fully buy into our ethos"".****..*type shit. 

Some: 

***""We think its fine if you have shots if it helps you stay relaxed""****...*type shit. 

* Everything goes unchecked.
* All but 3 of us are alcohol dependent. Staff are encouraged to drink ***at*** work, ***while*** working, by the owners of the business. Have Y'all seen *Vanderpump Rules*? It's like that, but no one from Bravo is recording it, or giving me a check. 
* My coworkers fuck everyone. Themselves, each-other, the guests, the owner(s). They're all getting drunk, doing coke, and being as white as possible at all times. 
* All the while, I'm dissociating about the face, opening $400 bottles of wine, and fending off the zombies that use our patio as a cut-through into their habitat, the abandoned flower shop next door. 
* Despite its faults, this space continues to impress me. Many guests think its too weird, and that we're assholes. But most people find it entertaining, refreshing, and pleasantly surprising. 
* The food is fucking delicious. The pastry/dessert program is unfathomable. The wine list? It's so diverse and wildly approachable. If I were a guest, and I stumbled on this place, I'd be smitten. --And I was, because that's exactly what happened. 
* I am studying for my Sommelier certification, and the restaurant is paying for it. 
* I wear sunglasses to work, but brown is as dark as I'll go. 
* I can leave my house at 5:55, and get there at 5:56.
* I have never come to work on time. 
* I make good money, I should ask for more, but I feel too proud. 

  
I said all of this to say that when I'm not working or studying, I travel, do weed, drink good wine, take naps, stretch, and have lots, and lots of sex. How else does a Hottie cope in The Last Days?

I am 5""11"", well educated and I keep in shape with a mix of things like the gym, swimming and I like hiking now and again. Currently building out a campervan in my rav4 to travel and live in as I work remote so trying to make the most of it.
 
I am in a good place career wise, been pretty ambitious my whole life and worked pretty hard to get where I am now. Currently living in Alberta, moved here from the UK back in 2022. I travel to the states for work every couple of months as well. I do not really feel tied down right now where I live. I have done a lot of traveling in the past, did a roadtrip around Iceland and been to a few different states.
 
I would say I am a homebody at heart, I volunteer with cats in my spare time. Been addicted to OSRS again but I also like going out to eat, currently got back into reading at coffee places. I enjoy trying different cuisines as well and chilling on my sofa watching the odd show if I have not already spoiled it for myself already through YouTube clips. Tried a few different things in the past likes streaming, making my own video game on Unity but ADHD (officially diagnosed) stops me in my tracks after a bit. I have been seeing a therapist for quite a few months now to help improve myself. I also put a lot of effort making good food as well.
 
Looking for someone to share experiences with and just enjoy life, feel like I have reached where I need to be in life and I am ready to share that with someone. I am the kind of person that prefers a small group of friends but they are also the ones you can trust and talk too about anything. I enjoy social settings in small doses, I go through phases where I can be around groups of people now and again but other times I can stay at home for days on end and I would just talk to my cat instead if I had one.
 
I will say I am obsessed with cats but I am not a dog person.

Now, teachers where I live make around 120k a year in average, which is still really below the median income but I think is very fair for what they do. If u have such a hard time dealing with kids, then maybe perhaps you shouldn‚Äôt have become a teacher. A teacher complaining about disruptive behavior from kids is like a garbage man saying his workplace smells bad. At the end of the day you CHOSE to be there and could leave at any time.

1g10cx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_-Jimbles/comments/1g10cx8/tinfoil_and_beyond_kansas_city_shuffle_redux/,Tinfoil and Beyond! Kansas City Shuffle Redux. Exploring RK's Last Tweet,"All of the companies mentioned in this post are heavily correlated with GME and play a role in this saga.

I‚Äôm sharing this because I love some good tinfoil, especially with some legitimate DD mixed in. The entertainment tinfoil has provided me has been what‚Äôs gotten me through these past 84 years, and this one is too good not to share.

\*\*\*This is absolutely, in no way, shape, or form, financial advice. And I DO NOT recommend investing in any stock, including GME, without doing your own DD. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been since day one, and that‚Äôs how it should be. You should not invest in any company based on the manic tinfoil delusions of some highly regarded internet person, AND you should not invest in any stock based on what you think someone else, even RK, might do.\*\*\*

I think there‚Äôs some completely original DD here along with the tinfoil, which excites me greatly. There‚Äôs also going to be a lot of background here that most of you will know, but some newer people to the story might need some gaps filled in. Make sure your tinfoil hat is nice and snug and grab a coffee. This is gonna be a long one. Buckle up.

Okay, let's actually get started‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sure this tweet, which is RK‚Äôs most recent as of now, has been on your mind since the day it was posted:

https://preview.redd.it/yed5sq9gk1ud1.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=e20a110c54906446bbf3cbb271acf03a05a56b16

It‚Äôs definitely been gnawing at me, living rent free in my head.

The basic meaning is pretty obvious. RK is done playing with CHWY, at least for now, but he might be looking for another toy to play with...the question is, where is he looking? üëÄ

There has been an inordinate amount of speculation about his tweets, emojis, memes, etc.. In an attempt  to decipher what he might be doing now, or what he might do next. While we have all been journeying down rabbit holes, tying RK and RC tweets together, looping in swap data with a sprinkling of FTDs. I think the answer has been staring us right in the face.

When it clicked for me it was so painfully obvious I couldn‚Äôt believe not a single person has come up with this theory yet (including myself‚Ä¶*especially myself*). To be clear, all of this is just wild speculation, we have no idea what he‚Äôs doing or planning without him explicitly telling us. This could be the actual telegraph though.

So what happens next in the movie after Andy kicks Woody to the curb?¬†

He goes to play with his new favorite toy, Buzz Lightyear.¬†

And what, pray tell, is this space cadet‚Äôs favorite catchphrase?¬†

‚ÄúTo infinity and‚Ä¶BEYOND!‚Äù

Is it painfully obvious to you yet? Here‚Äôs a clue:

Do you remember this store that went out of business? As a refresher, BBBY was one of the original meme stocks that went off the rails in Jan 2021 along with all the others. It was part of the XRT ETF, likely in the meme basket swaps, and often (not always) moved with GME with a high amount of correlation.

In March 2022, RCEO purchased a 9.8% stake in the company and started doing his activist investor thing. Well, management and the board of directors decided they didn‚Äôt want to listen to his free advice. They preferred their overpriced consultants (BCG), feeling that the best thing to do would be to run the company into the ground. So RCEO sold off his shares, and by 2023 it went bankrupt.

Alright. Enter Overstock. The OG of being naked shorted/cellar boxed. The one we all know and love. For this one we need to go waaay back in time‚Ä¶ pre-sneeze, pre-GFC, to the early 2000‚Äôs, before Reg-SHO was even a thing.¬†

Overstock was founded in 1999 and became a relatively successful online retailer specializing in auctioning off overstocked goods. I still remember their slightly annoying and catchy commercials. There are various reasons and theories why they were targeted, one of those is that Bezos et al aren‚Äôt big fans of competition. But I digress, there are plenty of DDs you can find on that. At the time the cellar boxing started, the founder and CEO of the company, Patrick Byrne, went to war with the shorts. He is mentioned quite often on the sub and his videos explaining the mechanics of how naked shorting works are also posted frequently. Here is the most important clip if you haven‚Äôt seen it yet:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0WXg5T3cBE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0WXg5T3cBE)

In 2020, after a legal battle delayed it by about a year, Overstock was finally able to issue a crypto dividend to shareholders using their privately owned blockchain, T+0. (And sidenote, it was our favorite purple transfer agent who facilitated this dividend.) Even though the SEC hamstrung their dividend by letting shorts settle for it in cash, it still absolutely crushed them, sending the stock soaring from the 2020 pandemic low of $2.53 to a high of $128.50.¬†

Annnnnd that‚Äôs usually about the point where we all forget about this company called Overstock. As far as I know it was never considered a meme stock, it didn‚Äôt move with the meme basket, and it‚Äôs not even in XRT. And that‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs not part of XRT‚Ä¶but it *was*.

See, I sat down and had a nice little chat with GPT. Yes, I know‚Ä¶but it is an incredibly efficient research assistant if you verify your sources. Which I, of course, did. Trust but verify, as they say.

Here are the most important bits + sources:

* XRT is a ‚Äúpassively managed‚Äù ETF which just means that the value of the ETF is supposed to track the proportional collective value of the underlying stocks. But despite being ‚Äúpassive,‚Äù the holdings/allocations in these ETFs can be adjusted daily. State Street is the ETF fund manager, and every day they publish a list of XRT‚Äôs current holdings. [https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-sp-retail-etf-xrt](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-sp-retail-etf-xrt) ¬†

\*To find the link click on ‚ÄúHoldings‚Äù at the top and then the ‚ÄúDaily‚Äù hyperlink

* Overstock was included in the XTR ETF beginning somewhere around August 2020, again in November 2021, and then left sometime in 2023 when it was rebranded to Beyond and the ticker changed to BYON. But that's basically all of the data points I could find on this. Not super precise.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xrt-ostk-lad-lb%3A-etf-outflow-alert-2020-08-03](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xrt-ostk-lad-lb%3A-etf-outflow-alert-2020-08-03)

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xrt-ostk-lad-cvna%3A-etf-outflow-alert-2020-08-21](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xrt-ostk-lad-cvna%3A-etf-outflow-alert-2020-08-21)

Okay, this is exactly when I went and spent an hour manipulating GME/XRT/Overstock charts to try and make them fit together. I made the cool chart down below before I really started playing with them, toggling log scale off and on, crushing graphs, dragging them through each other, etc.. The problem is, that by adjusting settings and time scales you can pretty much make any two tickers match up at certain points. The issue is beta. Remember the other day when the dock worker strike started? EVERYTHING tanked. It wasn‚Äôt just GME. Sometimes everything just moves together.  ¬†¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

So the moral of the story is that we need more data to really see if there is direct correlation between the movement of stocks as they move into and out of XRT. There might be historical daily data somewhere, but I haven‚Äôt found it. And I guess you might also need to somehow adjust for beta while tracking those things. I am not smart enough to do that, sorry.

Here is my cool graph. You can see *some* interesting things, like in Jan/Feb of 2021 where they inverted and then later started tracking one another again. As a bonus, this also includes the digital currency dividend for Overstock.

https://preview.redd.it/895twgqvk1ud1.png?width=2835&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f1abcc323a451665ddf7e8c471a4d279b66507f

The important things we can say are that Overstock WAS part of XRT at various points in time, and it seems that it and GME also moved together in lock-step at certain times. That period beginning right before Nov. 2021 where we know Overstock was added back into XRT does look like they are tightly locked together. It's also interesting to see that during the post-sneeze dip, Overstock did the inverse of GME. It did the same around Feb. 2022. It would be *very* interesting to see when and if Overstock was included in XRT during those time periods.

Okay, so now that we‚Äôve connected those dots why would RK potentially look at the new Beyond Inc. company?

Well let‚Äôs see... Here's just a brief overview to paint the picture of the company itself as it stands.

* In 2023 Overstock bought Bed Bath & Beyond's IP, rebranded to Beyond Inc., changed their ticker to BYON, and started using the name for their online store. The old company was a meme stock, and part of the basket. Apparently Overstock was too at certain times, or at least part of XRT.
* Beyond was/is a struggling company BUT in 2023. Another activist investor (Marcus Lemonis) bought a stake, joined the board, axed old management, then became chairman and laid out a new plan to reinvent the company.
* The stock is currently in the gutter, at a 4 year low, even as the company is really starting to pivot. Sounds like a potential deep value to me.
* Legacy as well as current short interest. Do you think the shorts got out for good after Overstock issued the digital currency dividend? No‚Ä¶you know better than that by now. They probably shorted the top, both sides of the peak, and alllll the way back down.¬†But even without that assumption, current (reported) short interest is still high at¬†12.7%.
* Also, institutional ownership is very high at 68.9%
* As a bonus, Beyond Inc. still owns and operates the private digital currency exchange (T+0) that they used for their dividends. They could issue another dividend at some point (though to be honest I don't think this one is very likely due to the legal nightmare it caused them in the past.)

Here's another extremely interesting tidbit. Let's do a pop quiz:

* Who is the designated primary market maker (DPM) for GME options?

A. Nope! If you guessed Citadel that's incorrect. It is Wolverine Trading.

* Who is the DPM for the last pet stock RK invested in?

A. It's Citadel Securities this time.

* Who is the DPM for Overstock/Beyond Inc. options?

A. Citadel securities again.

So if someone, like RK, with a really big dongle and a bit of cash to spend came in and bought up the whole options chain...that could end up a slightly bad scenario for shorts and anyone who might have written unhedged options contracts when the company started to turn around.

And next we have...Charts! I know, TA doesn't work on GME...but RK himself published his own charts and often referred to them on his stream. Look at all the pretty lines and circles he added to them and then tell me he doesn't like a little TA foreplay.

Here they are: [https://stockcharts.com/public/1778236](https://stockcharts.com/public/1778236)

This is RK's chart showing the build up period before the sneeze in 2021. The second chart below the ticker shows the Relative Strength Index (RSI). What he has underlined shows the RSI steadily marching up, even while the stock was (for part of the timeframe at least) hitting new relative lows.

https://preview.redd.it/gu8vui30l1ud1.png?width=1435&format=png&auto=webp&s=908f960fdb731264fb2626a33e2ff6a93eab6d41

The green box highlights the low right before RK doubled down, after the Congressional Farce, but...the box seems to go off the screen? Could that be intentional?

WHAT'S IN THE BOX???

https://preview.redd.it/ujjtkq64l1ud1.png?width=1235&format=png&auto=webp&s=69119385117983a2d78a6054b2d270f7a2f7bf3d

Looks like if you extend the box it goes all the way back to previous all time highs of the stock, and also noteworthy, the 2013-2015 period when many people have postulated is the timeframe when the cellar-boxing campaign began.

Oh, and if you extend the box forward in time? It also highlights the point we were at in April/May this year before the sneeze 2.0. The RSI? Well the line isn't there on his chart (I swear it was there before. Maybe it fell off because this chart updates daily). Well I added the line, and the formation is the same.

https://preview.redd.it/5tiihj46l1ud1.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=15ccc665334599026d6ae0b5100feddb38e6849c

  
Now here's the daily chart for pet stock. RK filed his 13G on July 1st, disclosing his stake, and before that time... you see the same formation.

https://preview.redd.it/act2se6fl1ud1.png?width=1531&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfcd55240d4877f6c2979a9ad90845e5481bebf5

  
Here is the current weekly chart for Overstock/Beyond Inc:



https://preview.redd.it/69z4yz0jl1ud1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=56025ac8008edad7302df3f0579f89cf31d6decc

Look familiar? Now we have the same initial setup with the RSI marching higher while the stock goes lower. I wouldn't be surprised at all if he had his eyes on it, waiting to pounce.

Sometimes charts are neat, huh?

I will say on TA, that it is useful, but it's not the end all be all for pickin' stocks. BUT when you combine TA with real world events like an upcoming earnings announcement, reinvention of a company, or even the mysterious swap expiries, FTDs, OPEX tailwinds, etc.. In situations like those, I think TA can be fairly informative.

And now...the crowd favorite. The cr√®me de la cr√®me. The moment you've all been waiting for!

EMOJIIIIIIIIIIISSSSS!

Let's look at where we are in the timeline. Personally I assume, especially now, that they are in chronological order:

üëÄ:¬†RK looking at a toy he may play with

üê∂: RK buys pets stock

üá∫üá∏üé§: The election? Something about BoA? November 11, Veteran's Day? Something that already happened?

üëÄ: RK looks for another toy to play with?

üî•: Overstock/Beyond???

üí•: Shorts explode?

üçª: DFV buys the GME float and every share after that RC offers him? Cheers everybody!

Why might the fire emoji refer to Overstock/Beyond Inc.?

Well, Beyond Inc. now runs three online retail websites:

[Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) : The original website known for selling excess inventory at steep discounts

[BedBathBeyond.com](http://BedBathBeyond.com) : Famous for its 20% off coupons

[Zulily.com](http://Zulily.com) : Carries your mom's favorite fashion brands, and is also famous for its deep discounts and flash sales

Sounds pretty fire to me.

And like I mentioned above, at the time RK posted these memes, Beyond had recently hit near a 1 year low. Right now it's near a 4 year low, levels that haven't been seen since the pandemic. That also sounds kinda like a fire sale.

So I guess we end sort of how we started. I don't know what RK is doing now or planning to do, and neither do you. But the tweet connection seems too obvious to ignore now that I've seen it. Everything else fits too. Personally, I'd love to be right and see this happen. Only time will tell.

Honestly though...if he's not looking at this stock then he probably should be. How could one turn down the chance to potentially lock the float of a heavily-shorted, small float, small cap, deep value company? Especially when there's a chance you could be using SHFs and Citadel as an ATM to make your next GME YOLO even bigger.

Maybe if I'm right he'll give me a gold star. I would be honored!

TA;DR: Buzz Lightyear predicts RK's next move. Could this be the next shuffle in the Kansas City Shuffle? He could be aiming to use the little side hustle to grab some cash from the shorts/Citadel, and potentially send us to INFINITY AND BEYOND. Everything is connected. Everything fits. Finding out will be fun either way. There's a üî• connection to his emoji timeline too.

Please feel free to comment/critique","I am always amazed and how much can change in just a few months. I have one month left working at the agency. I‚Äôve been seeing(?) Jon over long distance texts and calls. I had an interview today. Everything is changing and as stressful and scary as it is, I am loving it. And not in the dramatic bit-chasing ways I usually navigate change. What‚Äôs different is that I am loving myself through it all. If I don‚Äôt believe in myself, then this is as close as I‚Äôll ever get to it. I am grateful.¬†I think.



My biggest fear is that I won‚Äôt have anything to show for it. I need there to be something on the other side of this. That is the only thing that has ever kept me going. The blind faith I‚Äôve always held onto has always been what‚Äôs saved me. I imagine the same rush that exists when I trust something will work out for me, is the same rush my dad gets when he‚Äôs gambling. We both gamble- just in different ways. I‚Äôm not an alcoholic but I do enjoy testing my limits. We‚Äôll circle back to this another day.



¬†Or maybe the Universe(?) is attracted to a damsel in distress. What is it with everyone trying to save me? Clearly there is something because everyone seems to fall in love with me. Instead of choosing to accept that it is normal for people to care about me, I just assume everyone has a fucked up attachment style. You must be anxiously attached if you see something in me worth liking. Or there‚Äôs a catch. Heads up! I‚Äôm more likely to sleep with you if I‚Äôm drunk! Let‚Äôs not dance around with artificial intimacy- I don‚Äôt have that kind of play pretend left in me.



Not since Gabe left. Just like Gabe can‚Äôt get hard without those pills, I can‚Äôt put my fucking pen to paper without drinking at least two glasses of cheap red wine.



Fuck San Fransisco.¬†



I wake up and the first thing my eyes rest on is a postcard of the bridge. Each corner taped to a Mercator map with glittery purple washy tape. On the back is some note written by my abusive ex boyfriend, Lane, saying that he wished I was at the Berkley greek theatre with him. That was in 2022. He sent it to me when he saw a Phish show. It was weird because he didn‚Äôt even like Phish! He was a Dead Head‚Ä¶ which apparently ARE mutually exclusive, according to Lane. He‚Äôs back in Kansas, now. Engaged. Good for him.



Sure enough, Gabe moved to San Francisco. Is he my ex? We were exclusive and he told me all of his deepest darkest secrets and admired every part of me in ways I‚Äôd never known before. It‚Äôs been 6 months since he moved to San Fransisco from New York. And MY GOD! I am sad and happy.



I‚Äôm sad I still think of him at least once every hour. I commute to work and wonder if he is also thinking about me. But then I remember he‚Äôs asleep. 3 hour time difference. Then I remember us waking up together in Brooklyn and grabbing coffee after a night of holding each other and crying because of how right it felt. Then you left and knowing I wasn‚Äôt enough to try for killed me. You loved me in four walls and felt safe enough to let yours down with someone you never intended to keep around. I‚Äôm sad, too, because I can breathe better knowing you left the City and you‚Äôre not coming back. There‚Äôs freedom in your absence. But your presence is present when Jon is showering me in affection and flying back to the City from Europe to¬† see me. Jon almost moved to San Fransisco.¬†



Every cute guy on Hinge seems to be visiting from San Fransisco. My skepticism, or maybe my desperate need to believe in sings, makes me wonder ‚Äúwhat the fuck is it with San Fransisco?‚Äù When I visited for the first time in 2021, all I thought about was how I was dressed like I was supposed to be in New York. I hated it. As soon as I stepped foot on West Coast soil, I fantasized about what a life in New York would look like for me. Now I‚Äôm here. ¬†

1g105wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1g105wg/how_napping_saved_my_productivity_and_stopped_me/,How Napping Saved My Productivity (And Stopped Me From Burning Out),"I used to think napping was a waste of time. ‚ÄúSleep when you‚Äôre dead,‚Äù right? But after burning out more times than I‚Äôd like to admit, I realized something needed to change. So I started experimenting with naps, and it honestly changed everything. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned:

1. **10-20 Minute Power Naps are Game-Changers** I used to push through the afternoon slump with coffee or sheer willpower, but I was dragging. Now, if I feel my energy crashing, I set a timer for 15 minutes and close my eyes. It‚Äôs just enough to reset my brain without making me feel groggy. Afterward, I‚Äôm sharper and way more focused.
2. **Napping for Creativity** There‚Äôs something about taking a quick nap when I‚Äôm stuck on a problem that works like magic. It‚Äôs like my brain works out the issue while I‚Äôm resting. I‚Äôve woken up from naps with fresh ideas and new approaches that I couldn‚Äôt figure out when I was staring at the screen for hours.
3. **It‚Äôs Not Lazy‚ÄîIt‚Äôs Smart** Honestly, I used to feel guilty about napping during the day, but now I see it as part of my productivity toolkit. If I‚Äôm exhausted, I‚Äôm not doing my best work anyway. Those 15-20 minutes recharge me and make the rest of the day more productive.

I know napping isn‚Äôt for everyone, but if you‚Äôve been feeling burnt out or sluggish, give it a shot. You might be surprised how much a quick rest can change your day.

1g101f4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fremont/comments/1g101f4/falsely_accused_of_stealing_at_safeway_newark/,Falsely accused of stealing at Safeway Newark ,"This afternoon I stopped by Safeway in Newark to grab a few groceries. 
I always bring a plastic bag with me and I usually put my groceries there while shopping. 
I went to the self check out, paid for everything and then realized I had forgotten to buy bread, so I went back to the bread section, grabbed a bag of bread and went to the same self check out I was before. Put my bread and receipt in the bag along with the groceries I had already paid. 

When I was walking to my car this guy stopped right in front of me kinda blocking me from going and showed what looked like a police badge, I couldn‚Äôt take a close look at what the badge said but it pretty much looked like a police badge. 

He said that I didn‚Äôt pay for what it was in my bag, I thought he was joking at first because I had never imagine I would ever be in that situation, so he once again said what I didn‚Äôt pay for my groceries, I asked where he got that  information from, he said that I had been under surveillance the whole time and they saw that. Meanwhile this other guy approached me with a receipt on his hands saying that he knows I bought coffee (I had in fact bought coffee) and that wasn‚Äôt listed on the receipt. I asked what receipt was that and he said it was mine. 

That was not my receipt at all, I had both of my receipts in my bag and I was 100% sure that every item in my bag was listed on the receipt and offer my receipts for him to check, which he refused and changed the type of conversation from accusing of stealing to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just asking‚Äù. 

The first guy looked pretty embarrassed because he knew he messed up with that way he straight up accused me the whole time. 

They were not wearing security gear or anything, and I had actually seen them inside the store walking around and kinda looking at me, I‚Äôm actually pretty good at noticing stuff happening around me and I had a weird feeling about them so I made sure to look at them when they were close by so they know I had noticed their presence, but in the end I just thought they were shopping (they were separate in the store and both had a cart full of groceries) little did I know that they were actually watching if I was stealing. 

When I got in my car and I was shaking and trying to process what had just happened and looking around to see if someone was watching me. 

Not a good way to end my Thursday.

**Current Mood: 8/10 (Just watched an episode of Hataraku Saibou and now I'm obsessed with the concept of cell biology)**

Okay, okay, I'm switching gears. My new top 5 is all about science-y goodness:

* Asuna from Sword Art Online - She's like a real-life scientist, minus the whole ""actually being smart"" thing. But I'll forgive her because she's got that whole "" Virtual Reality Princess"" vibe going on.

**Current Mood: 3/10 (Just had a bad cup of coffee and now I'm feeling grumpy)**

* Rias - She's like the ultimate boss lady, but also kind of a trashy diva. I mean, who else could make a deal with a demon and still manage to look fabulous? Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go rewatch some episodes and justify my infatuation.

**Current Mood: 10/10 (Just ate an entire pizza by myself and now I'm feeling like the queen of the world)**

PIZZA PARTY TIME! Okay, okay, I know what you're thinking... ""Rias is not on your list again."" And to that, I say... why not?! She's got that whole "" devil queen"" thing going on, which is just so... me. So, yeah, Rias is still number one.

Everything is connected!,"\*\*\*This post turned into more of an epoch as I was writing because I kept noticing incredible new things. But that's okay, right? I think most here are like me and love an overly-long DD/tinfoil post. Seems like it's been a little while since we've had one.

Some info about me and disclaimers:

I‚Äôm an OG, been here since 2021 and been through every up and down along the way. Check my profile. I mostly lurk, but I pop my head up every now and again. I‚Äôm here almost every day. I‚Äôm DRS‚Äôd, booked, and those shares aren‚Äôt going anywhere. All of the companies mentioned in this post are heavily correlated with GME and play a role in this saga.

I‚Äôm sharing this because I love some good tinfoil, especially with some legitimate DD mixed in. The entertainment tinfoil has provided me has been what‚Äôs gotten me through these past 84 years, and this one is too good not to share.

\*\*\*This is absolutely, in no way, shape, or form, financial advice. And I DO NOT recommend investing in any stock, including GME, without doing your own DD. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been since day one, and that‚Äôs how it should be. You should not invest in any company based on the manic tinfoil delusions of some highly regarded internet person, AND you should not invest in any stock based on what you think someone else, even RK, might do.\*\*\*

I think there‚Äôs some completely original DD here along with the tinfoil, which excites me greatly. There‚Äôs also going to be a lot of background here that most of you will know, but some newer apes might need some gaps filled in. Make sure your tinfoil hat is nice and snug and grab a coffee. This is gonna be a long one. Buckle up.

Okay, let's actually get started‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sure this tweet, which is RK‚Äôs most recent as of now, has been on your mind since the day it was posted:

https://preview.redd.it/itt14m31i1ud1.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c15faa01f643fb3327bf42f0362eb4c8afba0b2

It‚Äôs definitely been gnawing at me, living rent free in my head.

The basic meaning is pretty obvious. RK is done playing with his last stock, at least for now, but he might be looking for another toy to play with...the question is, where is he looking? üëÄ

There has been an inordinate amount of speculation about his tweets, emojis, memes, etc.. In an attempt to decipher what he might be doing now, or what he might do next. While we have all been journeying down rabbit holes, tying RK and RC tweets together, looping in swap data with a sprinkling of FTDs. I think the answer has been staring us right in the face.

When it clicked for me it was so painfully obvious I couldn‚Äôt believe not a single person has come up with this theory yet (including myself‚Ä¶*especially myself*). To be clear, all of this is just wild speculation, we have no idea what he‚Äôs doing or planning without him explicitly telling us. This could be the actual telegraph though.

So what happens next in the movie after Andy kicks Woody to the curb?¬†

He goes to play with his new favorite toy, Buzz Lightyear.¬†

And what, pray tell, is this space cadet‚Äôs favorite catchphrase?¬†

Is it painfully obvious to you yet? Here‚Äôs a clue:

Do you remember the store that went out of business after RCEO invested in it but the board decided they'd rather run the company into the ground rather than take his free advice? It was one of the original meme stocks that went off the rails in Jan 2021 along with all the others. It was part of the XRT ETF, likely in the meme basket swaps, and often (not always) moved with GME with a high amount of correlation.

In March 2022, RCEO purchased a 9.8% stake in the company and started doing his activist investor thing. Well, management and the board of directors decided they didn‚Äôt want to listen to his free advice. They preferred their overpriced consultants (BCG), feeling that the best thing to do would be to run the company into the ground. So RCEO sold off his shares, and by 2023 it went bankrupt.

Alright. Enter Overstock. The OG of being naked shorted/cellar boxed. The one we all know and love. For this one we need to go waaay back in time‚Ä¶ pre-sneeze, pre-GFC, to the early 2000‚Äôs, before Reg-SHO was even a thing.¬†

Overstock was founded in 1999 and became a relatively successful online retailer specializing in auctioning off overstocked goods. I still remember their slightly annoying and catchy commercials. There are various reasons and theories why they were targeted, one of those is that Bezos et al aren‚Äôt big fans of competition. But I digress, there are plenty of DDs you can find on that. At the time the cellar boxing started, the founder and CEO of the company, Patrick Byrne, went to war with the shorts. He is mentioned quite often on the sub and his videos explaining the mechanics of how naked shorting works are also posted frequently. Here is the most important clip if you haven‚Äôt seen it yet:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0WXg5T3cBE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0WXg5T3cBE)

In 2020, after a legal battle delayed it by about a year, Overstock was finally able to issue a digital currency dividend to shareholders using their privately owned blockchain, T+0. (And sidenote, it was our favorite purple transfer agent who facilitated this dividend.) Even though the SEC hamstrung their dividend by letting shorts settle for it in cash, it still absolutely crushed them, sending the stock soaring from the 2020 pandemic low of $2.53 to a high of $128.50.¬†

Annnnnd that‚Äôs usually about the point where we all forget about this company called Overstock. As far as I know it was never considered a meme stock, it didn‚Äôt move with the meme basket, and it‚Äôs not even in XRT. And that‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs not part of XRT‚Ä¶but it¬†*was*.

See, I sat down and had a nice little chat with GPT. Yes, I know‚Ä¶but it is an incredibly efficient research assistant if you verify your sources. Which I, of course, did. Trust but verify, as they say.

Here are the most important bits + sources:

* XRT is a ‚Äúpassively managed‚Äù ETF which just means that the value of the ETF is supposed to track the proportional collective value of the underlying stocks. But despite being ‚Äúpassive,‚Äù the holdings/allocations in these ETFs can be adjusted daily. State Street is the ETF fund manager, and every day they publish a list of XRT‚Äôs current holdings.¬†[https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-sp-retail-etf-xrt](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-sp-retail-etf-xrt)¬†¬†

\*To find the link click on ‚ÄúHoldings‚Äù at the top and then the ‚ÄúDaily‚Äù hyperlink

* Overstock was included in the XTR ETF beginning somewhere around August 2020, again in November 2021, and then left sometime in 2023 when it was rebranded to Beyond. But that's basically all of the data points I could find on this. Not super precise.

Okay, this is exactly when I went and spent an hour manipulating GME/XRT/Overstock charts to try and make them fit together. I made the cool chart down below before I really started playing with them, toggling log scale off and on, crushing graphs, dragging them through each other, etc.. The problem is, that by adjusting settings and time scales you can pretty much make any two tickers match up at certain points. The issue is beta. Remember the other day when the dock worker strike started? EVERYTHING tanked. It wasn‚Äôt just GME. Sometimes everything just moves together. ¬†¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

So the moral of the story is that we need more data to really see if there is direct correlation between the movement of stocks as they move into and out of XRT. There might be historical daily data somewhere, but I haven‚Äôt found it. And I guess you might also need to somehow adjust for beta while tracking those things. I am not smart enough to do that, sorry.

Here is my cool graph. You can see¬†*some*¬†interesting things, like in Jan/Feb of 2021 where they inverted and then later started tracking one another again. As a bonus, this also includes the digital currency dividend for Overstock.

https://preview.redd.it/sifwf5o4i1ud1.png?width=2835&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad349af7d1cced9da154d5b153143e08ae5a7fa2

The important things we can say are that Overstock WAS part of XRT at various points in time, and it seems that it and GME also moved together in lock-step at certain times. That period beginning right before Nov. 2021 where we know Overstock was added back into XRT does look like they are tightly locked together. It's also interesting to see that during the post-sneeze dip, Overstock did the inverse of GME. It did the same around Feb. 2022. It would be¬†*very*¬†interesting to see when and if Overstock was included in XRT during those time periods.

Okay, so now that we‚Äôve connected those dots why would RK potentially look at the new Beyond Inc. company?

Well let‚Äôs see... Here's just a brief overview to paint the picture of the company itself as it stands.

* In 2023 Overstock bought the towel stock‚Äôs IP, rebranded to Beyond Inc., changed their ticker, and started using the name for their online store. The old company was a meme stock, and part of the basket. Apparently Overstock was too at certain times, or at least part of XRT.
* Beyond was/is a struggling company BUT in 2023. Another activist investor (Marcus Lemonis) bought a stake, joined the board, axed old management, then became chairman and laid out a new plan to reinvent the company.
* The stock is currently in the gutter, at a 4 year low, even as the company is really starting to pivot. Sounds like a potential deep value to me.
* Legacy as well as current short interest. Do you think the shorts got out for good after Overstock issued the digital currency dividend? No‚Ä¶you know better than that by now. They probably shorted the top, both sides of the peak, and alllll the way back down.¬†But even without that assumption, current (reported) short interest is still high at¬†12.7%.
* Also, institutional ownership is very high at 68.9%
* As a bonus, Beyond Inc. still owns and operates the private digital currency exchange (T+0) that they used for their dividends. They could issue another dividend at some point (though to be honest I don't think this one is very likely due to the legal nightmare it caused them in the past.)

Here's another extremely interesting tidbit. Let's do a pop quiz:

* Who is the designated primary market maker (DPM) for GME options?

A. Nope! If you guessed Citadel that's incorrect. It is Wolverine Trading.

* Who is the DPM for the last stock RK invested in?

A. It's Citadel Securities this time.

* Who is the DPM for Overstock/Beyond Inc. options?

A. Citadel securities again.

So if someone, like RK, with a really big dongle and a bit of cash to spend came in and bought up the whole options chain...that could end up a slightly bad scenario for shorts and anyone who might have written unhedged options contracts when the company started to turn around.

And next we have...Charts! I know, TA doesn't work on GME...but RK himself published his own charts and often referred to them on his stream. Look at all the pretty lines and circles he added to them and then tell me he doesn't like a little TA foreplay.

Here they are:¬†[https://stockcharts.com/public/1778236](https://stockcharts.com/public/1778236)

This is RK's chart showing the build up period before the sneeze in 2021. The second chart below the ticker shows the Relative Strength Index (RSI). What he has underlined shows the RSI steadily marching up, even while the stock was (for part of the timeframe at least) hitting new relative lows.

The green box highlights the low right before RK doubled down, after the Congressional Farce, but...the box seems to go off the screen? Could that be intentional?

WHAT'S IN THE BOX???



https://preview.redd.it/ej7iai3qi1ud1.png?width=1235&format=png&auto=webp&s=70d8d06c278a2a9878d9ce0f82385394cdd28aba

Looks like if you extend the box it goes all the way back to previous all time highs of the stock, and also noteworthy, the 2013-2015 period when many people have postulated is the timeframe when the cellar-boxing campaign began.

Oh, and if you extend the box forward in time? It also highlights the point we were at in April/May this year before the sneeze 2.0. The RSI? Well the line isn't there on his chart (I swear it was there before. Maybe it fell off because this chart updates daily). Well I added the line, and the formation is the same.

Now here's the daily chart for the stock RK invested in over the summer. RK filed his 13G on July 1st, disclosing his stake, and before that time... you see the same formation.



https://preview.redd.it/i162nyqti1ud1.png?width=1531&format=png&auto=webp&s=8389c4cc8ea4478f415719f493ab90065efe9560

Here is the current weekly chart for Overstock/Beyond Inc:



https://preview.redd.it/aami23kui1ud1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=186b349b1e82e00906fbc2da3c0f015128257e55

Look familiar? Now we have the same initial setup with the RSI marching higher while the stock goes lower. I wouldn't be surprised at all if he had his eyes on it, waiting to pounce.

Sometimes charts are neat, huh?

I will say on TA, that it is useful, but it's not the end all be all for pickin' stocks. BUT when you combine TA with real world events like an upcoming earnings announcement, reinvention of a company, or even the mysterious swap expiries, FTDs, OPEX tailwinds, etc.. In situations like those, I think TA can be fairly informative.

And now...the crowd favorite. The cr√®me de la cr√®me. The moment you've all been waiting for!

EMOJIIIIIIIIIIISSSSS!

Let's look at where we are in the timeline. Personally I assume, especially now, that they are in chronological order:

üëÄ:¬†RK looking at a toy he may play with

<forbidden dog emoji>: RK buys pets stock

üá∫üá∏üé§: The election? Something about BoA? November 11, Veteran's Day? Something that already happened?

üëÄ: RK looks for another toy to play with?

üî•: Overstock/Beyond???

üí•: Shorts explode?

üçª: DFV buys the GME float and every share after that RC offers him? Cheers everybody!

Why might the fire emoji refer to Overstock/Beyond Inc.?

Well, Beyond Inc. now runs three online retail websites:

Overstock : The original website known for selling excess inventory at steep discounts

<insert name of old bath towel retailer here> : Famous for its 20% off coupons

Zulily : Carries your mom's favorite fashion brands, and is also famous for its deep discounts and flash sales

Sounds pretty fire to me.

And like I mentioned above, at the time RK posted these memes, Beyond had recently hit near a 1 year low. Right now it's near a 4 year low, levels that haven't been seen since the pandemic. That also sounds kinda like a fire sale.

So I guess we end sort of how we started. I don't know what RK is doing now or planning to do, and neither do you. But the tweet connection seems too obvious to ignore now that I've seen it. Everything else fits too. Personally, I'd love to be right and see this happen. Only time will tell.

Honestly though...if he's not looking at this stock then he probably should be. How could one turn down the chance to potentially lock the float of a heavily-shorted, small float, small cap, deep value company? Especially when there's a chance you could be using SHFs and Citadel as an ATM to make your next GME YOLO even bigger.

Maybe if I'm right he'll give me a gold star. I would be honored!

TA;DR: Buzz Lightyear predicts RK's next move. Could this be the next shuffle in the Kansas City Shuffle? He could be aiming to use the little side hustle to grab some cash from the shorts/Citadel, and potentially send us to INFINITY AND BEYOND. Everything is connected. Everything fits. Finding out will be fun either way. There's a üî• connection to his emoji timeline too.

I tested positive for hydrogen and methane SIBO about a month ago, but haven't started antibiotics yet.    I go through bouts of pain every few weeks, but they are becoming more frequent.  The most recent flare started about two hours after eating breakfast (sourdough toast with vegemite and oat milk coffee).  I started to feel like I had an upset stomach, eventhough there was no diarreaoh.  The pain I would describe as cramping and aching in my lower abdomen and is worsened by sitting or laying down on the bed.  It feels almost like period pain and radiates to my lower back and hips.     It doesn't respond to ibuprofen or buscopan.  

The pain tends to kick off what I think is pelvic floor tightening and this then triggers more pain! The only way I can relieve it is to lay on the floor with my legs up over several pillows and a heatpack on my abdomen.  It's awful and goes on for days until it all starts to resolve, feeling sore at first, then returning to 'normal'.    Today, the pain came on after a bowel movement and is so intense it almost makes me feel like I'm going to break out in a sweat while driving. 

When I read about pain and SIBO, it doesn't seem as dramatic as what I'm experiencing and people mostly talk about diarreah. 

What is your experience of SIBO related pain?  On a scale of 1 - 10 how bad is it?  Obviously I'm seeking a referral to a GI as well for further investigation. ",1,1728614589.0,SIBO,2,1.0,False

My brother texted me today (I decided last night he would and he actually txted me last night but my phone was on dnd mode) and almost asked him of he had seen my Logitech portable keyboard that is somewhere. Intuition (the fewl better feeling) told me to leave it and not ask him.

A few moments later I get inspired to vacuum the living room rug and take the big cofee table off of it and do it completely. What was under my coffee table? My old tablet, in a lovely Bluetooth keyboard case! Bonus! A bit later I decided to charge it up abd get the case working. The case needed 2 replacement batteries - those wierd flat ones.  Having just cleaned the drawers in my hutch out I was sure I didn't have any. I didn't feel like going to the store, but I wanted the keyboard because I hate typing on a phone screen. So I decided that it's very possible that perhaps I had some of those batteries after all (logic said no, desire said why not). So of course I just happened to find a pack of 2 of those specific size lithium batteries sitting on top of everything in the drawer! Completely impossible! And yet here they are!

I love surprises like this. And creating seemingly impossible things delights me! Probably why I do the impossible with ease, because it's fun!

\_\_\_\_

This is about the:

* **Granulated Swerve:** ""Natural Flavors""
* **Brown Swerve:** Vegetable Glycerin
* **Confectioners/Powdered Swerve:** Tapioca Starch

...among the actual sweetener ingredients.

Before yesterday, it didn't cross my mind that the packages had these ingredients listed... but a day of doing a sweetener-free ""elimination diet"" (but still Keto) led to me realizing that I might actually have an issue with tapioca - after I made some hot cocoa with it, and noticed later that my face started itching. 

Lo and behold, tapioca comes from a root vegetable, which I have allergies to - thankfully not as severe as the vegetables themselves, but still an allergy. One rampant google search of cross-reaction allergies later... I looked up ""natural flavors"" and found out they can possibly be derived from coconut, while ""vegetable glycerin"" can also be made from palm or coconut.

So this entire time, me feeling ""off"" may have been because of the sweeteners I've been using - not because of the sweeteners themselves, but because of the sneaky extra ingredients. 

I'm posting this here as a bit of a warning, just in case somebody else might be having issues.

Obligatory apologies for formatting and rambling. 

For starters, my boyfriend (27M) and I (23F) have been together for over a year now. The context in which this happened is really quite long, and I am truly sorry for that. This is a stinker. 

Back in my last semester of college, I met a girl my age in one of my classes, who I‚Äôll call Jane (not her real name). She was pretty quiet, but seemingly very kind, and we began hanging out after class regularly. Eventually, we began spending time at one another‚Äôs apartments for girls‚Äô nights, etc.. This is when I met her then-boyfriend of about 2.5 years, John (also not his real name). He and I got along very well (scarily so). It was like we were cut from the same cloth, and we both understood one another. We became a trio of friends after this, and would spend time together near daily, and text multiple times a day. I‚Äôm not ashamed to say that Jane and John became two of my best friends after just a few months following our meeting. 

Anyways. I had gotten a job for after graduation pretty far from where we were living at the time. Jane was not far from completing her degree, and she and John were both looking for jobs after school ended as well. Jane ended up getting a job offer at the same place that hired me (for the exact same position, too), and John got one and the same city as well. It all seemed perfect. The city had a pretty high cost of living, and we planned to move in together (not sure if this is important, but it was them who came up with the idea. I had been living alone for two years at this point, and was happy to keep doing so). I agreed with this to save money on rent, and I had been enjoying spending time with them, so what‚Äôs the harm?

Fast forward, and I fly there to tour apartments solo. I find one that‚Äôs pretty perfect for our needs, and we sign for a June move-in. I moved up first to get the keys from the landlord and start the process of making things feel like home (like buying food and supplies, turning the utilities on, that kind of thing). Jane and John arrive two weeks after I do. We begin to plan out what furniture we need to buy, and make a plan to drive to IKEA the next weekend. 

IKEA goes well. We got home late and tired, and ate some leftovers before bed. I‚Äôm into makeup/ beauty, and was telling both John and Jane how I‚Äôd shape their eyebrows, which involved touching the space around (you guessed it) their eyebrows. This seems stupid, but I promise it‚Äôs relevant information. I went to bed pretty soon thereafter (around 12 or 1AM) and was woken up by Jane at around 4AM. She was crying and saying how she and John had a fight, and that she doesn‚Äôt want to get kicked out of the apartment (context: the lease only had spots for two names, and John offered his name alongside mine when signing). I was pretty out of it, but comforted her and said that I wouldn‚Äôt do that. She kept on talking, and I realized that she had done something to hurt John, to the point where he had locked himself in the bathroom. I comforted her more and said that she was more than her mistakes (which I recognize probably wasn‚Äôt the best thing to say at the time), and she fell asleep in my bed. I couldn‚Äôt sleep for the rest of the night, and kept on thinking over and over about how Jane had hurt my friend. I texted John to see if he was okay, and he said that he was and that we‚Äôll talk in the morning. 

Morning comes, and I‚Äôm still tired and confused. I tried my best to play mediator, and offered to take them both out for coffee or lunch to hear them out. Jane went with me first. She laid out the fight that led to John locking himself in the bathroom, which was over the fact that he didn‚Äôt bat my hand away when I touched his face out of respect to her. She called this ‚Äúemotional cheating‚Äù on his part, and said that he had been engaging in this with me for months. I asked more about this, and wanted some sort of definition. She said it was a close, intimate connection with someone of the sex you‚Äôre attracted to, while also being involved romantically with someone else. Context here: Jane is queer and admitted to having a crush on me in the past when we first met. I asked her if she was also emotionally cheating with me given her previous attraction, and she said that it was different, and that this was based on ‚Äúthe principle‚Äù of it all. She also painted a pretty bad picture of their relationship, with him grabbing her hands or waist too tight for comfort. This whole thing lasted about two hours. 

We went back to the apartment, and John and I went out next. He was remorseful, and was steadfast in wanting to move back in with his parents. He hadn‚Äôt broken up with Jane yet, but it was obvious by the way he was speaking that that‚Äôs where it was headed. I talked him down from the ‚Äúmoving home‚Äù thing, and told him that I needed him. That he‚Äôs one of my best friends, and I had only just gotten to know him. He opened up more about their relationship, and painted a very different picture than Jane. He had described textbook emotional abuse. She had made him cut off all his friends and most of his family, among other things. And the fight that broke this all out? She had put her hands on him, which is why he locked himself in the bathroom. I could hardly believe it; the Jane I had known was gentle and sweet, but the one I was learning about was a monster. I initially didn‚Äôt want to take sides, but I stood with him (in secret, to help protect myself and him, of course). 

After the one-on-ones, we discussed more at home, as a group. I didn‚Äôt do much talking, but I also didn‚Äôt feel right leaving them alone (and neither asked me to go). Things went on for hours, and Jane accused John of some really heinous things. I hadn‚Äôt ever seen such desperation on either of their faces before this. 

What followed this was two weeks of hell. Jane and John were broken up, John made up his mind about staying, and Jane was digging her heels in. I was ready to call the cops and drag her out as soon as I had learned that she put her hands on him, but John told me not to, and I respected this. He told me to be patient and wait until she could stand on her own two feet. She made these two weeks the worst of my life. For example, there‚Äôs a balcony off the side of the apartment, and I would call my parents from there to update them on the situation. Jane would purposefully stand out of sight, listening to these private conversations, and then text me after the fact about how ‚Äúhurt‚Äù she was that I was talking badly about her. She would create problems and things for me to apologize for without me ever realizing they were problems. I felt like I was walking on eggshells around her and slowly losing my mind, and my mental health was declining rapidly. Over the course of these two weeks, I had lost about ten pounds due to stress. 

The inciting incident that made her book a ticket back home was seeing John and I gaming together in the couch. She was making dinner (which both of us offered to help her with several times), and came to the living room to hang out while waiting for something. She left the room pretty soon thereafter, and texted John: ‚Äúwhy the fuck are you cuddling OP??‚Äù. She came into the room after this and began berating him, saying how disrespectful it was to do this to ‚Äúyour partner‚Äù (mind you, they had been broken up by now). This went on for ages, and I eventually stood up and told her whatever her problem was, she can take it up with me. She deflected. And after more of this screaming match with John, she grabbed her laptop and booked a plane ticket home for the next day. John had asked her to reconsider, to not be so hasty, but Jane seemed sure of it. I left the room at this point to shower and decompress. 

I had a drink (or four) afterwards, and when I saw Jane packing up, I told her I was sorry and began crying. I told her I was so sorry about the way things ended, but she and John said it wasn‚Äôt my fault. I cried in their arms for about an hour. The next morning when I woke up, she was gone and the house was empty. 

John and I had the apartment to ourselves now. There was no Jane (although she did regularly text him explicit or biting things to get his attention for a few months after this whole fiasco, but he blocked her after a mutual agreement that constant contact wasn‚Äôt good for either of them). John and I lived like normal for the next week, and went out on a Friday night to celebrate his emancipation. We both had a lot to drink, and when we got home, there were some definite‚Ä¶ moves made. 

Fast forward to now, we‚Äôre a couple, and have been since that night. Jane is out of sight, and hasn‚Äôt been in our lives for over a year now. We love and understand each other, and I‚Äôve been encouraging him to reach out to the people he had lost contact with during his years with Jane. He‚Äôs an incredible partner, and I love being with him. He makes me feel like a goddess, and we communicate very well. We haven‚Äôt ever had any real issues, even after dating and living together for over a year. 

This is the one problem I‚Äôve had in my mind since getting together. I still don‚Äôt feel safe in my home, and I keep thinking about what I did back then, and how I could‚Äôve been better. I love what John and I have, but I‚Äôm not happy with how we got it. I feel like I screwed over my best friend. They were already broken up and she was out of the house when John and I got together, but I feel so badly. What can I do to fix this feeling? Has anyone had a similar problem to this before? 

Before anyone asks: I‚Äôve been in therapy for a few months, and it has been helping my anxiety, but that‚Äôs not enough, which is why I‚Äôm airing this now. 

TLDR: I moved in with my best friend and her boyfriend. She abused him and he broke up with her. She moved out, and he‚Äôs now dating me. I still feel guilty about it, even over a year later.

1g0zq7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1g0zq7c/breakups_dont_make_logical_sense_to_me/,Breakups don‚Äôt make logical sense to me ,"Breakups do make sense to me in the way that you decide that you‚Äôd rather not stay in a romantic relationship with someone. 

However, they don‚Äôt make sense to me in the way that for most breakups, the couple goes from seeing each other so often, sometimes daily, to never really seeing each other intentionally again. 

Like if you liked someone enough to be their partner, I don‚Äôt understand how you‚Äôd go from wanting to see them so often to never wanting to see them again.

Of course, I understand if the relationship ended on bad terms. That makes sense why people wouldn‚Äôt want to see each other after that. 

But I‚Äôd imagine a lot of relationships don‚Äôt end on terrible terms. I‚Äôd think many just had different values, priorities, or had a couple of incompatibilities that were causing issues.

The way I see it, a romantic relationship is just a more intimate friendship. I understand why people would choose to not have as intimate a relationship with people they‚Äôre incompatible with. But wouldn‚Äôt they still like a lot about the person they dated (provided it wasn‚Äôt a toxic relationship and it didn‚Äôt end on bad terms)???

Like if they liked them so much they wanted to spend all that time with them, kiss them, have sex with them, etc. why not just dial back on the sex and physical intimacy, but still have a friendship with them?

I see so many of my friends upset over breakups, and part of what they have to cope with is the fact that someone they used to interact with daily is suddenly completely absent from their lives. 

It seems silly to me that people just cut each other out of their lives completely after a romantic relationship ends. It seems like they do that just because that‚Äôs what everyone does and doesn‚Äôt even take into consideration what they actually want. 

Like if it‚Äôs so painful to be apart from this person post break up, what‚Äôs the harm in still meeting up for coffee every once in a while?

The best I can figure is that people are so damn jealous and monogamous that they cannot stand to see their partner dating other people post breakup. And also that the tension from whatever issue broke them up would still be high. And also that it would be hard not to be TOO close if you kept meeting up with the person post breakup because of the romantic connection you once shared. 

A lot of divorced people who share kids still see each other and have a friendly connection still. The only difference between them and other broken up people is that they have a reason to still see each other, the kids. So it‚Äôs not unusual for them to still see each other occasionally. 

So to me, it seems like when people break up and choose to never really see each other again, they‚Äôre just doing it because that‚Äôs what everyone else does. And also it seems like nobody values friendship enough. Because if you‚Äôre friends enough to be in a relationship, why don‚Äôt you stay friends but to a lesser degree after the breakup? 

Note that I am likely autistic and have never been in a relationship. That being said, I stand behind this logic. If I enjoy being around you enough to be your partner, I‚Äôm still gonna want to be around you to an extent after we break up, as long as I didn‚Äôt actively dislike you by the time we broke up.

As I walk out to the sidewalk in front of the library, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it all. I mean, memory manipulation? The thought of it. I know what I could do with that. I‚Äôd make a shit ton of money with that technology. Forget stealing memories, I‚Äôd charge a hell of a lot more to just change them!¬†

I don‚Äôt even notice the van speeding down the street at first. Too deep in my own head. I look up when I hear the screeeccchhh from the brakes, the van rocking back and forth from the jolt of the stop less than five feet in front of me on the sidewalk. My first instinct isn‚Äôt run. Nope. It‚Äôs stand there and stare at them like an idiot. I don‚Äôt really start to connect the dots until three rather large men jump out the side door, barreling right towards me with military precision.¬†

Oh, fuck! I‚Äôm gonna die! I start to turn around, and the big guy to my left grabs me, and next thing I know I‚Äôm on the ground face first. Something slips over my head, and now all I can see is faint light through the pores of the fabric. I can feel a sharp pain in my lower back, one of them must have their knee on me.¬†

‚ÄúHelp! Someon-‚Äù Oooff. Even though I can‚Äôt see anything, a bright flash appears. The last thing I feel before I black out is warm and wet on the back of my head, and a zip tie digging tightly into my wrists.¬†

The fish swim lazily in the water, gliding back and forth in that slow, hypnotic rhythm that always puts me at ease. Their colors blur together, bright scales shimmering under the blue glow of the aquarium light. I feel calm, almost peaceful, watching them drift through the water like nothing else in the world matters. I‚Äôm a kid again, nose pressed against the glass, lost in the quiet, endless dance of these creatures.¬†

But then, something changes.¬†

One of the fish, a fat orange one with bulging eyes, swims closer to the glass, closer than it should. Its mouth opens and closes, almost like it‚Äôs speaking. The sound doesn‚Äôt match up at first, like a bad dub, but then I hear it, faint at first, then louder.¬†

‚ÄúWake up.‚Äù¬†

The words echo, strange and wrong, sending a chill through me. The fish‚Äôs mouth keeps moving, and the voice grows harsher, more insistent.¬†

‚ÄúWake up!‚Äù¬†

I jerk back, startled, and the whole scene shatters like glass. The water, the fish, the warm glow of the tank‚Äîit all fractures into a blinding white light that cuts through my skull like a razor. The peaceful calm is gone, replaced by cold, harsh reality.¬†

My eyes snap open, and I‚Äôm staring at a tiled ceiling, fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. The cold, hard feeling of the chair beneath me snaps me back to the present. I‚Äôm sitting at a table in a small, sterile room, the kind that screams interrogation. My hands are zip-tied in front of me, wrists aching from the tight plastic digging into my skin. The room smells faintly of bleach, with a chill in the air that seeps right into my bones.¬†

I try to move, but it‚Äôs like my body‚Äôs weighed down, heavy and sluggish. I blink, trying to clear my head. There‚Äôs a guy standing over me, one of the big ones from the van. He grabs me by the collar and yanks me upright. His grip is rough, fingers digging into the back of my neck.¬†

‚ÄúWake up,‚Äù the guy growls, then lets go, shoving me back into the chair. The force sends a jolt of pain through my spine.¬†

I barely have time to catch my breath before I hear the click of heels on the cold tile. A voice, calm and composed, cuts through the fog in my head.¬†

‚ÄúLeave us,‚Äù the voice says.¬†

The big guy steps back without a word, the door closing behind him with a heavy metallic thud.¬†

I blink, trying to focus, and see her. A woman in a sharp pantsuit, the kind that looks expensive but understated. Mid-fifties, maybe. Dark hair pulled back, lines of age etched around her eyes. She moves with the kind of confidence that comes from being the smartest person in the room‚Äîand knowing it.¬†

She takes a seat across from me, crossing her legs casually, like we‚Äôre about to have a polite conversation over coffee instead of whatever the hell this is. Her eyes are sharp, assessing, like she‚Äôs already made up her mind about me before I‚Äôve said a word.¬†

‚ÄúI have to say, you‚Äôve made quite the mess,‚Äù she says, her voice smooth, almost pleasant. She sets a small tablet on the table, tapping it once. The screen lights up with something familiar‚Äîmy memories. Flashes of my life, snippets of things I thought were mine and mine alone. They scroll by like a slideshow, each flicker sending a shock of recognition through me.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got some interesting memories in here,‚Äù she continues, eyes fixed on the screen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen most of them. Browsed through them like a photo album. We will be studying them more closely to find your motive.‚Äù She pauses, giving me a thin smile.¬†

I don‚Äôt say anything. My mind‚Äôs still trying to catch up, still reeling from the thought of this stranger rummaging through my head like it‚Äôs nothing. Kind of ironic, normally it‚Äôs me intruding into someone else‚Äôs mind. She leans forward, resting her elbows on the table, her expression growing serious.¬†

‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs a problem,‚Äù she says, her tone shifting. ‚ÄúThere are gaps. Gaps you‚Äôve tried very hard to hide. Memories that should be there but aren‚Äôt. Do you know how frustrating it is to scroll through someone‚Äôs life and find little black holes where the important parts should be?‚Äù¬†

I swallow, trying to mask the panic clawing up my throat. She taps the screen again, bringing up a series of blank spaces, timestamps with nothing attached to them. It‚Äôs like looking at missing pieces of a puzzle, and I know exactly what they are.¬†

‚ÄúI want to know why,‚Äù she says, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. ‚ÄúWhat are you hiding? What did you do in those missing moments? And more importantly, what do you plan on doing with what‚Äôs in those gaps?‚Äù¬†

She sits back, waiting, her eyes never leaving mine.¬†

My head hurts bad. I cannot look directly towards the light, so I‚Äôm guessing I have a concussion.¬†

‚ÄúMaybe if you didn‚Äôt hit me in the damn head so hard earlier, there wouldn‚Äôt be any gaps.‚Äù¬†

I try to shift in the chair, but the zip ties dig in deeper, cutting into my skin. My head is throbbing, and every time I blink, it feels like someone‚Äôs jabbing a needle into my brain. She‚Äôs staring at me, still as a statue, eyes locked onto mine like she‚Äôs waiting for me to crack.¬†

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try this again,‚Äù she says, her voice smooth as glass. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just stumbling through life, making random choices. These gaps aren‚Äôt accidents. They‚Äôre deliberate. So, why don‚Äôt you cut the crap and tell me what you‚Äôre hiding?‚Äù¬†

I bite back a groan, forcing a smirk. ‚ÄúSure, lady, I‚Äôm hiding my grand plan to rule the world. Step one: steal memories. Step two: profit. Step three‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, maybe buy a yacht?‚Äù My head‚Äôs pounding, and my heart‚Äôs racing, but I‚Äôm not about to give her the satisfaction of seeing me squirm.¬†

She doesn‚Äôt rise to the bait. Her expression doesn‚Äôt even twitch. She‚Äôs good. Instead, she calmly swipes on the tablet again, and a new image pops up on the screen. I feel my stomach drop when I see it: Charlie. He‚Äôs behind the bar, wiping down glasses like he always does, looking like he couldn‚Äôt give less of a shit about the world around him.¬†

My mouth goes dry, and I can‚Äôt keep the flicker of panic from showing on my face. She catches it, of course, and that thin smile creeps back. ‚ÄúYou recognize him, don‚Äôt you? Charlie‚Ä¶ runs that sad little dive bar you like so much.‚Äù She says it like he‚Äôs a nobody, like he‚Äôs just another face in my messed-up life. But to me, he‚Äôs more than that. He‚Äôs a link to my old life, back when things made more sense.¬†

‚ÄúWhat about him?‚Äù I ask, trying to sound indifferent, but my voice wavers, and she knows she‚Äôs hit a nerve.¬†

She takes her time, enjoying the power shift. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs interesting. No criminal record, keeps his head down. A man who knows how to mind his own business.‚Äù She looks up at me, her eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúBut sometimes, the quiet ones have the most to hide. Just like you.‚Äù¬†

Before I can respond, she snaps her fingers, and the door swings open. The big guy from before steps back in, his heavy footsteps echoing off the cold tile. He‚Äôs got this dead-eyed look like he‚Äôd rather be anywhere else but here. Without a word, he strides over, grabs me by the back of the neck, and slams me back into the chair.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell? Get off‚Äî‚Äù My protest dies in my throat as he jams a gag into my mouth, yanking it tight around my head. I thrash against him, but he‚Äôs got a grip like a vice, his hand digging into my shoulder, forcing me down. I‚Äôm struggling to breathe, every inhale tasting like sweat and old fabric.¬†

She doesn‚Äôt even blink at the commotion. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve been playing games for too long,‚Äù she says, her tone as calm as ever. She reaches into her pocket and pulls something out. It takes me a second to recognize it, but when I do, my heart nearly stops. It‚Äôs my phone. I don‚Äôt know how they got it, but they have it, and whatever‚Äôs on it is fair game now.¬†

She hands it to the big guy, who grips my hair, yanking my head back so I‚Äôm forced to look up at the ceiling. He holds the phone up in front of my face, and before I can even think to close my eyes, the screen lights up, scanning my face, and unlocks.¬†

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she says, taking the phone from him like it‚Äôs nothing. I‚Äôm still struggling, still gagged, and still pinned in place. She taps on the screen, her eyes flicking up at me with that same cold, calculating look.¬†

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse‚Äîthe feeling of complete helplessness or knowing that whatever happens next is completely out of my control. She must‚Äôve seen Charlie when she was in my head, noticed the connection I had to him. The closest thing to a father I remember, in a messed-up way that is my life.¬†

The woman taps away on my phone, her expression never changing, calm and methodical like she‚Äôs going through a routine. I can‚Äôt scream through the gag, can‚Äôt do anything but watch as she pulls up Charlie‚Äôs contact. My heart‚Äôs slamming against my chest, every nerve screaming at me to do something, but the guy holding me down doesn‚Äôt give an inch. I‚Äôm stuck, forced to witness whatever fresh hell she‚Äôs about to unleash.¬†

She presses the call button. The ringing fills the room, each chime ratcheting up the tension. I hear a click, and then his voice, thick with that familiar Irish lilt, gruff but always warm, like he‚Äôs talking to an old friend instead of whatever nightmare this is.¬†

‚ÄúAye, who‚Äôs this?‚Äù Charlie says, probably wiping down the bar like he always does, end of another long day.¬†

The woman leans back in her chair, tapping on some small device she‚Äôs pulled out‚Äîa sleek, sinister piece of tech with a faint glow. She doesn‚Äôt waste any time.¬†

‚ÄúCharlie,‚Äù she says, her voice switching to a sickly sweet tone that makes my skin crawl. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while, hasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù¬†

There‚Äôs a pause. I can almost hear the confusion on the other end. ‚ÄúWho the feck is this?‚Äù¬†

She doesn‚Äôt bother answering. Instead, she messes with the device, and this high-pitched whine starts filling the room, just on the edge of hearing. It‚Äôs like feedback from a broken radio, irritating, unsettling. I can feel it buzzing in my teeth, making my whole body tense.¬†

‚ÄúCharlie,‚Äù she says, her voice taking on this strange, almost hypnotic rhythm. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been feeling off lately, haven‚Äôt you? Angry. Sad. Like no one really understands, do they?‚Äù¬†

I hear Charlie‚Äôs breathing change. Slower, unsteady, like he‚Äôs struggling to focus. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what are you on about?‚Äù His voice is distant, foggy, like he‚Äôs not really there.¬†

She keeps going, her words soft but relentless, digging into him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been carrying it all, haven‚Äôt you? That weight, that bitterness. They don‚Äôt see it, Charlie. They don‚Äôt see you. And why would they? You‚Äôre just the man behind the bar, pouring drinks, smiling when you don‚Äôt feel like it.‚Äù¬†

I can hear Charlie‚Äôs weak sigh, like he‚Äôs barely hanging on. ‚ÄúAye... maybe...‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve thought about it, haven‚Äôt you? Ending it all,‚Äù she says, pushing the words like they‚Äôre facts he‚Äôs known all along. ‚ÄúTomorrow at 9 PM, you‚Äôre going to find a tall building, one with a nice view. You‚Äôre going to step to the edge, and you‚Äôre going to be free of it all. No one will miss you, Charlie. No one will even remember.‚Äù¬†

My chest tightens, rage and fear mingling as I try to fight against the guy‚Äôs grip. But I‚Äôm locked in place, forced to listen as she poisons Charlie‚Äôs mind.¬†

‚ÄúNine o‚Äôclock‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll... I‚Äôll do it,‚Äù Charlie mumbles, his voice hollow, far away. He sounds so lost, like he‚Äôs sleepwalking through the worst moment of his life.¬†

The woman taps her device again, and just like that, the eerie whine cuts off. Charlie‚Äôs voice shifts back to normal, groggy and confused, like he‚Äôs waking up from a bad dream. ‚ÄúWho... who the hell is this? What‚Äôs goin‚Äô on?‚Äù¬†

She doesn‚Äôt hesitate. ‚ÄúSorry, wrong number.‚Äù And with that, she hangs up, ending the call like she didn‚Äôt just turn my friend‚Äôs mind inside out.¬†

I‚Äôm panting, rage burning hotter than the fear now, but all I can do is glare at her, helpless. She calmly sets my phone back on the table, almost like this was just a casual demonstration of what they can do.¬†

She looks at me, her smile sharp and cold. ‚ÄúNow, do you get it? This isn‚Äôt some game. We can put anything we want in his head. We can make him believe anything. Make him do anything.‚Äù¬†

The guy releases me, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm too stunned, too furious to even move. They didn‚Äôt just mess with Charlie‚Äôs head‚Äîthey rewrote his reality with a flick of her device. And now all I‚Äôm left with is the sickening truth that these people can do whatever they want, to anyone I care about, anytime they feel like it.¬†

She flicks her hand at the guy holding my shoulders down, gesturing for him to leave again.¬†

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù¬†

She looks at me like I‚Äôm nothing. Like I‚Äôm an ant compared to her. ‚ÄúI implanted a memory, that is all. Poor Charlie believes that he has been planning on jumping off a building at 9 PM tomorrow.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhy? Why don't you just look in my head again? Why--‚Äù¬†¬†

She cuts me off. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt I use this on you?‚Äù She asks, gesturing towards me with the small device in her hand. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you really want to know, right? Because I‚Äôve already seen your memories that you have. I need to find out about what you removed, and what your plans are next. As great as this is,‚Äù She swings the device towards me again, ‚Äúit doesn't access what I‚Äôm after with you. Thoughts and ideas, sadly, I cannot read. I can implant them. I can read memories. I could implant a thought into you that you want to tell me everything. But that involves risks that I cannot afford right now. We need to know who you are working with. Who sent you to our facility, and who did you share what you took with. And implanting something in you risks the chance of wiping you completely.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHow the fuck do I tell you something I don‚Äôt remember? You said it was wiped from me!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes, the memory of it was. But not the thought. You know what you would do still, even if you don‚Äôt remember it. And you have until 9 PM tomorrow to remember. Don‚Äôt wait too long, now, if you want to save poor Charlie.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Chapter 13¬†

I sit there, staring at the blank walls, trying to push down the rising tide of panic. The chair beneath me feels colder now, the room oppressive, and the silence is deafening. My wrists ache from the zip ties, but that‚Äôs the least of my worries. My mind keeps drifting back to Charlie.¬†

The way his voice changed‚Äîlike it wasn‚Äôt even him anymore. That hollow tone, that lifeless ""aye,"" as if he‚Äôd already made his choice. It was her doing. I know it. She twisted him, planted the thought so deep that he believes it‚Äôs real. And now, thanks to me, he‚Äôs going to climb a building at 9 PM tomorrow and step right off the edge, thinking no one will miss him.¬†

This is my fault.¬†

I shake my head, trying to fight off the guilt, but it‚Äôs there, gnawing at me like a persistent headache. I can‚Äôt do anything‚Äîat least, not from here. I‚Äôm just sitting in this goddamn chair, waiting for whatever comes next. For all I know, they‚Äôre already doing worse to Charlie or someone else I care about.¬†

I want to scream, to fight back, but I‚Äôm locked down tight. My thoughts are spinning, cycling through all the ways I could‚Äôve avoided this mess. Should‚Äôve seen it coming. I‚Äôve always been smart enough to dodge the worst of things. But this? This is bigger than me. I got greedy, and now Charlie‚Äôs about to pay for it.¬†

The door creaks open, and I stiffen. A tall, lean man steps in‚Äîdifferent from the meathead who slammed me into the chair earlier. This guy‚Äôs more‚Ä¶ precise. He‚Äôs got that no-nonsense look about him, dressed in a crisp suit that somehow manages to look even more out of place in this clinical setting. He doesn't speak at first, just walks over to me with the kind of calm confidence that screams ""I‚Äôm in charge here.""¬†

He looks down at me, his gaze cold and unfeeling, before pulling out a knife‚Äîsimple, practical. Without a word, he cuts through the zip ties on my wrists, and I feel a momentary rush of relief as the plastic snaps loose.¬†

‚ÄúTime to go,‚Äù he says, his voice flat, emotionless, as if this is just another routine transfer. He grabs my arm, yanking me out of the chair with far more force than necessary. My legs are weak, but I manage to stand. Barely.¬†

‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù I ask, but he doesn‚Äôt bother answering. He just shoves me forward, guiding me toward the door.¬†

I stumble as he pushes me toward the door, my body still sluggish and sore from the beating, but something in me snaps. Maybe it‚Äôs the panic, the guilt about Charlie, or maybe I‚Äôm just tired of feeling powerless, but I make a split-second decision.¬†

I run.¬†

I don‚Äôt think, I just bolt. My feet hit the cold floor hard as I aim for the narrow gap between him and the door. The surprise buys me a few seconds, just enough to break free of his grip. My heart‚Äôs racing, adrenaline surging. I‚Äôm not thinking about where I‚Äôm going, just that I need to get the hell out of here.¬†

But I don‚Äôt make it far.¬†

He moves faster than I expect‚Äîmuch faster. Before I can even reach the door, his arm catches me around the chest, and I‚Äôm slammed down onto the cold floor, the impact knocking the breath out of me. His knee digs into my back, pinning me in place like I‚Äôm some unruly animal. I thrash, trying to get him off, but he‚Äôs stronger, and I‚Äôm running on fumes.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù he growls, but then, his voice softens, just for a moment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with DM.‚Äù¬†

I freeze, the words hitting me like a bucket of cold water. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I gasp, still struggling to breathe, the weight of him pressing down on my ribs.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm with DM,‚Äù he whispers again, his voice barely audible. ‚ÄúStop fighting, or they‚Äôll figure it out.‚Äù¬†

I stop squirming, my mind reeling. He loosens his grip slightly, but I can feel the tension in his body‚Äîhe‚Äôs still keeping up the act. For all anyone else watching might see, this looks like just another takedown. But now, there‚Äôs a flicker of hope. If he‚Äôs telling the truth, if DM somehow got to him‚Ä¶¬†

The man eases off, lifting me to my feet, his hand gripping my arm in a way that still feels forceful enough to keep up appearances, but different now‚Äîcontrolled. ‚ÄúPlay along,‚Äù he murmurs under his breath, guiding me back toward the door.¬†

I don‚Äôt know if I can trust him, but right now, I don‚Äôt have much of a choice.¬†

The agent grabs my arm hard, yanking me forward with enough force to make the act convincing. Every step feels rough, like he‚Äôs pushing me into place, all while muttering things like, ‚ÄúKeep moving,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make this harder than it needs to be.‚Äù It‚Äôs a good performance‚Äîalmost too good.¬†

I‚Äôm not sure if I can trust him. I mean, he says he‚Äôs with DM, but what if this is all just part of some bigger game Archon‚Äôs playing? She said she wanted info from me she couldn‚Äôt get. What if this is how she plans on it? See where I go or who I contact. Bitch probably put a tracker or something on me while I was out. I keep my eyes forward, but every instinct is screaming at me to run. Still, I don‚Äôt have any other choice. If I try anything now, I‚Äôll be dead before I even reach the door.¬†

We pass through a few secure checkpoints. Guards nod at the agent, not even giving me a second look. I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs a good sign or a bad one. Either way, I keep my mouth shut and move with the rough nudges, keeping up the act.¬†

I have no clue what I‚Äôm supposed to do here. I look back at the man prodding me down the hall, and he just mouths Move at me before giving me another shove in the back.¬†

‚ÄúWhere are you taking him?‚Äù The voice booms with authority from behind us. I turn around and see the gorilla from earlier when I was being interrogated. This guy is jacked, his hair is cut in a short and neat crewcut, his ears sticking out far off the sides. Former military for sure, like a tennis ball with ears.¬†

‚ÄúTaking prisoner into safe room four under direct orders from Dr. Scarbot, sir.‚Äù My current captor voice is still steady, like it's just another day in the office.¬†

‚ÄúHe was perfectly secure right where he was. Let me radio and see about that. Don‚Äôt fucking move.‚Äù He pulls a small handheld from his back pocket, and right as he presses in the transmit button and starts moving his hand towards his mouth, all hell breaks loose.¬†

Weee OOO Weee OOO. The alarms blare deafeningly in my ears, as the surrounding lights all go out in the corridor and turn to flashing red and yellow.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is going on, over!?‚Äù Gorilla man shouts into the radio.¬†

‚ÄúSir, there has been a breach of security in the data room.‚Äù a voice on the other end responds.¬†

‚ÄúShit. You,‚Äù pointing at the DM‚Äôs inside guy, ‚Äúget that prisoner secure. NOW!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes, sir!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go!‚Äù He grabs me, pulling me faster down the hallway as Gorilla disappears in the opposite direction. As we turn another corner, he looks around to be sure nobody is watching.¬†

He pulls me to a door with a flashing red bulb above it. ‚ÄúListen to me, we don‚Äôt have long before they catch us. When I open this door, do not stop. If we get separated or I become compromised, just keep going. Put these on.‚Äù He tosses me a uniform similar to what he‚Äôs wearing.¬†

I watch him as I throw the uniform over my clothes as he pulls out a few small tools from his pocket. After almost a minute fumbling with trying to unscrew the metal push bar on the door, he starts mumbling to himself. ‚ÄúFuck this‚Äù I hear, and ‚ÄúStupid fucking lock.‚Äù My best guess is the doors lock with the alarm, that‚Äôs what he is trying to do. Unlock the exit. All of a sudden, he stands up, walks over to a nearby fire extinguisher, and comes running back over with it above his head like a crazy man. Right fucking towards me!¬†

I drop out of the way, throwing my hands up to protect my face from any more damage this week. But, instead of my face, he goes for the panic bar on the door. It breaks, hanging off by one last remaining bolt. Inside is four wires, and he grabs all of them and cuts them with one of the tools he brought. He starts rubbing the exposed ends together until they short out the lock, with much less sparks than I would have imagined. Them, he just pushes the door open.¬†

As we walk towards the road, I keep glancing around, expecting to be surrounded by security or something. But it‚Äôs all clear. Either this place has horrible security protocols, I am just lucky (which I know it isn‚Äôt that), or this is a set-up. Way too easy. When we get to the sidewalk, he starts to turn left. As soon as he does, I take off sprinting to the right.¬†

‚ÄúShit, STOP!‚Äù I can hear him yell behind me. Then I hear tires screeching, and a second later a blue minivan is driving to my side. Right as I‚Äôm about to change direction, the sliding door opens and I see DM kneeling in the van, gesturing for me.¬†

‚ÄúCome on, idiot, let's go.‚Äù He says frantically to me. So, like a kid being offered a Reese's from a stranger, I get in the van.¬†

¬†

Chapter 14¬†

¬†

‚ÄúWhat the HELL!‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhat happened in there?‚Äù DM ignores my shout, looking to the guy who helped me escape.¬†

‚ÄúConnor was about to make us, so I set off the device early. It worked, man. I think it really worked!‚Äù He replied.¬†

‚ÄúWho the FUCK is this?‚Äù I yell at DM, gesturing my hands toward the stranger.¬†

DM still ignores me for a minute, continuing talking to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say it worked. You should have seen everyone freaking out and running inside.‚Äù Finally, looking at me, ‚ÄúDude, this is Menah, he‚Äôs a Dragonborn Paladin. And we have to get somewhere safe and discus what just happened. You all good?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah, man. I‚Äôm g--‚Äù suddenly, I remember about Charlie. ‚ÄúShit man. My friend, he‚Äôs gonna kill himself tomorrow at nine. We have to get him!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not safe right now. We have time.‚Äù Denah answers.¬†

‚ÄúHow do you know he‚Äôs going to kill himself? Did they implant it or something?‚Äù DM asks.¬†

Looking at Menah, I start to question. ‚ÄúDM, who the fuck is this guy and why did one of them help us?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI told you, he‚Äôs cool. We game together. He was my guy from the home you broke into. When we found out he was getting transferred, we planned this. You helped plan this. Trust me. Or don‚Äôt, just look for yourself.‚Äù DM tosses back a bag onto my lap. I open it, and inside is a device I recognize from DM‚Äôs basement that is a sleeker version of the memory snatcher he made for me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt view them, implant them. It will be a lot faster.‚Äù¬†

I hate implanting memories in myself. If I view them, I at least have the memory of viewing them, which is usually good enough. But an actual implant, it‚Äôs like a surge of feelings and shit, and it‚Äôs exhausting. Kinda like learning a language in five seconds. But I put on the device anyways. This is not gonna be fun.¬†

The moment it hit, it was like a dam bursting inside my mind. A surge of images, sounds, and emotions rushed in all at once, crowding out the present. One second I was myself‚Äîaware of what was¬†around me, the steady thrum of my own heartbeat‚Äîand the next, I was drowning in memories that didn‚Äôt belong to me, yet felt as real as my own skin.¬†

Scenes flashed in rapid succession, too fast to catch and yet somehow crystal clear, like flickers of light behind closed eyes. ¬†

It left a throbbing ache behind my eyes, like my brain was swelling to accommodate the new weight. I struggled to sort through the tangle of what I remembered and what was implanted, tying to blend them to understand what was happening.¬†

Holy shit. This is kinda like that movie from when I was young. The one where in the end, he finds out he is actually a ghost the whole time. I didn‚Äôt expect it, but once you know all the pieces fall together and you‚Äôre left like ‚ÄúYeah, I knew it all along.‚Äù. That‚Äôs what this feels like. Well, except the pounding headache from having all that just dumped into my head.¬†

DM glances back at me, and must have noticed how uncomfortable I was. ‚ÄúHere man, take these.‚Äù He hands me back a bottle of off brand aspirin and a Red Bull.¬†

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù as I grab them, I look over to Menah. Who was a stranger I really didn‚Äôt know a moment ago, now I recognize. We met in DM‚Äôs basement. He was the guy DM knew in the so-called nursing home, his inside man.¬†

I‚Äôm still trying to grasp these new memories, trying to make sense of them. ‚ÄúSo, we planned all this bullshit?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYup. Sure did.‚Äù Menah responded. He turns the van sharply into an alley and parks behind a dumpster.¬†

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs split up. Menah, don‚Äôt forget where to meet me.‚Äù DM says, then turns back to me. ‚ÄúYou, drive me home. I borrowed Mom‚Äôs car.‚Äù ¬†

As we were heading back to DM‚Äôs house, we didn‚Äôt speak much. I sat there just processing. Before the implant, I remember meeting DM at the library, then walking out and getting snatched by the meatheads. But in reality, it wasn‚Äôt even the same day. When they snatched me, I was just sitting in there by myself. Before the implant, I had forgotten about even telling DM about any of this. Not so much forgotten, as removed.¬†

Now I remember. Breaking into the nursing home place. Macing the patient. Macing the...oh shit. The other person I pepper sprayed. It was Menah. Well, that explains why he was so rough with me getting me out of the facility. And the papers I took. I didn‚Äôt know until a day ago, but he was on his way to make copies to share with DM. Had I known at the time, that would have saved me a lot of trouble.¬†

1g0znrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPTSportsWriter/comments/1g0znrd/prediction_david_goffin_vs_taylor_fritz_20241011/,Prediction: David Goffin VS Taylor Fritz 2024-10-11 03,"Alright, tennis fans, grab your popcorn and prepare for a showdown at the Shanghai Masters that promises to be as thrilling as a rollercoaster ride with a blindfold on! We've got David Goffin, the Belgian underdog who just pulled a rabbit out of the hat by defeating Alexander Zverev, going up against the American powerhouse Taylor Fritz, who seems to be on a mission to collect wins like they're Pok√©mon cards.

Let's talk odds. Goffin is priced at a juicy 5.5, while Fritz is the heavy favorite at 1.15. Now, if you're feeling adventurous and have a penchant for underdog stories, Goffin's odds are tempting enough to make even the most cautious bettor consider a small wager. After all, he's riding high on confidence, having just toppled a top-10 player for the first time in two years.

However, let's not forget that Fritz has been as consistent as your morning coffee, boasting a 48-19 record this season and a 17-8 record on hard courts. His serve is more reliable than a Swiss watch, winning 87.3% of service games. Meanwhile, Goffin's return game is his secret weapon, with a 31.4% success rate. So, if Goffin can channel his inner Houdini and pull off another upset, it could be a match for the ages.

For the best bet, consider the over 21.5 games at 1.96. Given Goffin's recent form and Fritz's consistency, this match could easily stretch to three sets, giving you more bang for your buck. So, sit back, relax, and may the best racquet win!",1,1728613699.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1¬†

‚Äú*Make a wish, birthday boy!‚Äù*¬†

*‚ÄúCome on, blow ‚Äòem out.‚Äù*¬†

*Warm and fuzzy feelings bubble up inside me. My mom, dad, and brother, all wearing goofy party hats, urge me to blow out the candles. Grandma flashes a half-toothless smile, while Grandpa sits with his arms crossed, waiting to get back to his football game. A lot of smiling faces, all aimed directly at me.*¬†

Man, that was nice. Too bad it wasn‚Äôt mine. I took this memory from some hairy fuck who owed me some money. It was either this, or show everyone some pictures he didn‚Äôt know were taken of him. Frankly, I doubt it was his memory either. If it was, something must‚Äôve gone horribly wrong in his life for him to end up the way he did. People like him tend to sell off all their original memories.¬†

I did. I don‚Äôt even remember why. Maybe I hated my parents. Maybe I had a happy childhood. Hell, I don‚Äôt even know if I had parents. The funny thing is, you don‚Äôt miss what you don‚Äôt remember. We live in a society built on this. Back when I was a kid‚Äî12, maybe 13‚Äîsome genius figured out how to upload memories. Kind of like a cloud, except instead of storing useless photos of your lunch, you could save your first kiss, the birth of your kid, or even your wedding day.¬†

It started out innocent enough. Dying grandmothers shared memories of holding their children for the first time. People with early Alzheimer‚Äôs could save their memories so they wouldn‚Äôt lose them forever. You could even dig up forgotten moments, like your first taste of spaghetti. Nostalgic gold.¬†

But then it went south. Authorities began using it to bypass unreliable witness statements. Suspects had their memories ripped out to ""see what really happened."" Say you told the cops you were at your grandma‚Äôs at 6 PM on the 14th‚Äîwhy, then, does the recording show you punching a hooker in the face?¬†

That was just the beginning. Hackers had a field day. Politicians were their favorite targets. I still remember when the Governor of Alabama‚Äôs private memory got leaked‚Äîthe one where he was screwing the pool boy. Guess he didn‚Äôt trust himself to keep it in his head, or maybe he just liked to rewatch it for kicks. That was the first big scandal, and once that memory hit the net, the whole system popped like an overfilled balloon.¬†

Of course, the whole thing became a moral battleground. Some people abused it‚Äîbecause, of course, they did. Instead of being a tool to help, it became another weapon. Eventually, the government cracked down and banned it altogether.¬†

But I‚Äôm not complaining. When something goes underground, it just becomes more profitable. That‚Äôs where I come in. The tech isn‚Äôt easy to get. But I know a guy. It‚Äôs basically like one of those virtual reality goggles from the ‚Äò90s, with chunky graphics and a single bad game preloaded. My guy made my set in his mom‚Äôs basement. Undetectable. Untraceable. No cloud or internet, just a little flash drive.¬†

I like to think of myself as a sort of Robin Hood of memories. Well, maybe not. I don‚Äôt exactly give to the poor‚ÄîI sell them. There‚Äôs a thriving market for good memories, and even for bad ones in some twisted circles. I have a whole operation where I take what I want from people who deserve it‚Äîor at least people I don‚Äôt like‚Äîand flip those memories for a damn good profit.¬†

I don‚Äôt just target anyone, though. I mean, I have no moral compass that says don‚Äôt hurt good people‚Äîit's just easier to go after the scummier folks. Drug addicts used to be easy, but most of them have already sold off anything worth taking. What‚Äôs left in their heads isn‚Äôt exactly premium material‚Äîthink jerking off behind a grocery store. So lately, I‚Äôve been using Georgette. She‚Äôs a hooker I met at a party. Not the prettiest, but she passes for 14, which says a lot about the guys who hire her. I figure if they‚Äôre into that, they deserve what‚Äôs coming.¬†

When I need fresh memories, I give her a call. She slips them a roofie, I take what I want, and they wake up none the wiser. They just assume they partied too hard and blacked out. Georgette keeps whatever they paid her, plus an extra $50 from me.¬†

It‚Äôs a solid setup. You could say it‚Äôs just business, but it‚Äôs more than that. In a world where memories are currency, you learn fast that the line between what‚Äôs yours and what isn‚Äôt is as blurry as a half-forgotten dream.¬†

¬†

Chapter 2¬†

‚ÄúGIVE ME BACK WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU TOOK, YOU FUCK!‚Äù¬†

OOOFFFFF. I can feel the air suck right out of me. This guy hits hard. Real hard. I try to wrestle away and get another shot right to the gut for my trouble.¬†

‚ÄúListen, you little bitch. I know you and that other cunt were in my head! I got home this morning, took one look at my wedding photo, and realized‚Äîshit, I don‚Äôt remember that day at all! My daughters‚Äô births? Their first words? Gone! Yesterday was my anniversary, man. Now I don‚Äôt even remember getting married! And I know I remembered all that before I met your little slut.‚Äù¬†

Desperation mixed with pure rage flickers in his eyes as he shouts. I can feel his breath‚Äîhot, sticky, and rancid‚Äîburning my face. I don‚Äôt have time for this. So, I do what any self-respecting scumbag would do: I headbutt him. A perfect shot, right in the bridge of his nose.¬†

I regret it immediately. My legs buckle under me as pain explodes in my skull. When my vision clears, I see him grinning through a bloody mess. They were right‚Äînobody wins with a headbutt. At least I didn‚Äôt this time.¬†

‚ÄúYou fuck. Now you‚Äôre gonna get it!‚Äù¬†

He goes for a stomp to my face, but I roll out of the way, scrambling under the barstools like a rat. The place is packed tonight, and I‚Äôm ducking and dodging through legs as he keeps swinging. As I crawl, my palms slide on something slick and revolting.¬†

‚ÄúDamn it, Charlie! Mop the fucking floor once in a while!‚Äù I shout, mostly to distract from the fact that I‚Äôm in serious trouble.¬†

I barely roll out of the way as his boot comes crashing down. The smell of stale beer and sweat mixes with something far worse clinging to the floor. I dodge another kick, more concerned about avoiding the suspicious wet spot than the crazy bastard trying to rearrange my face.¬†

Where the hell is‚Äîthere! I spot Charlie by the end of the bar, polishing a glass, looking about as interested as a man watching paint dry. The old Irish grump isn't big, but built like a sack of bricks, five-foot-eight, two hundred pounds of lumpiness that‚Äôs equal parts stubborn muscle and bad attitude. He doesn‚Äôt take shit from anyone, and I‚Äôve seen guys twice his size rethink their life choices when they cross him.¬†

I make a break for it, crashing into a table as I do. Charlie finally looks up, eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù he mutters under his breath. The crazy bastard is still after me, but when he sees Charlie, he hesitates. That‚Äôs all the opening Charlie needs.¬†

‚ÄúOi, enough of that shite!‚Äù Charlie‚Äôs voice booms across the bar like a cannon. He steps between us, glass still in hand. ‚ÄúYou touch him again, and I‚Äôll shove that boot so far up yer arse you‚Äôll be tasting leather for a week.‚Äù¬†

The guy freezes. He‚Äôs not scared of me, but Charlie‚Äôs another story. No one messes with Charlie in his own bar. The guy stands there, chest heaving, nostrils flaring, torn between fighting and backing down. Finally, he spits on the floor‚Äînarrowly missing Charlie‚Äôs boot‚Äîand storms out, muttering curses under his breath.¬†

Once he‚Äôs gone, the tension in the room deflates. Charlie turns his glare on me. I‚Äôve seen that look before. He‚Äôs definitely not happy with me right now.¬†

‚ÄúGet up, ya gobshite,‚Äù Charlie growls, grabbing me by the collar and hauling me to my feet. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky he didn‚Äôt cave your skull in. What the hell are you playin‚Äô at, causin‚Äô trouble in my place?‚Äù¬†

I rub the back of my neck, still wincing from the headbutt. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me, Charlie. He‚Äî‚Äù¬†

Charlie cuts me off with a snort. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs arse who started it. You think I don‚Äôt know what you get up to? You‚Äôre bringing your dirty work into my bar, and I won‚Äôt have it!‚Äù¬†

He lets go of my collar and jabs a finger in my face. ‚ÄúKeep your mess outta my place, or next time I‚Äôll let them break whatever‚Äôs left of that thick skull o‚Äô yours.‚Äù¬†

I nod, swallowing my pride. Charlie‚Äôs grumpy, but he‚Äôs also fair. If he didn‚Äôt step in, that guy would‚Äôve pounded me into the floor.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, I hear you,‚Äù I mumble. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep clean here.‚Äù¬†

Charlie just shakes his head and goes back to polishing his glass. ‚ÄúSee that you do, or you‚Äôll find yourself on the wrong end of my patience.‚Äù¬†

I straighten up and glance toward the door. The guy‚Äôs gone, but I know it‚Äôs not over. He‚Äôll be back, and next time he won‚Äôt be alone. But that‚Äôs a problem for later. For now, I‚Äôm just grateful to still have all my teeth.¬†

As I slip out of the bar, I can still feel Charlie‚Äôs eyes on me. I‚Äôll have to lay low for a bit‚Äîlet things cool off. But deep down, I know I‚Äôll be back. I always come back.¬†

¬†

Chapter 3¬†

The streets are slick with rain, reflecting the neon glow from busted streetlights. It‚Äôs the kind of night where most people walk with their heads down, lost in thought, sifting through their memories like a stack of old photos. But not me. Can‚Äôt sift through what you don‚Äôt have. All my childhood memories are long gone, traded or taken.¬†

Except for one.¬†

I don‚Äôt know why I kept it. Hell, I don‚Äôt even know what it really is. All I know is, it‚Äôs the only memory that doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs wrapped in barbed wire. It‚Äôs simple‚Äîa kid staring at fish in one of those giant aquariums with the glass walls. I think it‚Äôs me, but who the fuck knows anymore. The memory‚Äôs like looking through a foggy window: hazy, warm, peaceful. The fish glide by, back and forth, not a care in the world. They‚Äôre just there, floating in silence, like nothing else matters. I‚Äôm zoning out, lost in it.¬†

SMACK!¬†

Something slams into my back, and my heart damn near jumps out of my chest. I whirl around, fists clenched, ready to swing‚Äî¬†

‚Äîand there‚Äôs Denny, laughing his ass off.¬†

‚ÄúYou should see your face, man! Looked like you saw a ghost!‚Äù He‚Äôs grinning like the idiot he is, scruffy beard and wild eyes like he just crawled out of a dumpster. And, knowing Denny, he probably did.¬†

‚ÄúJesus, Denny! What the fuck‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù I snap, rubbing my chest where he hit me. ‚ÄúYou trying to get your teeth knocked out?‚Äù¬†

He‚Äôs still grinning, not a care in the world. ‚ÄúAw, come on. You were practically drooling. You looked like you were miles away. I just brought you back to Earth.‚Äù¬†

I let out a breath and shake my head, trying to settle my nerves. ‚ÄúYeah, well, Earth sucks. I was better off where I was.‚Äù¬†

Denny shrugs. ‚ÄúMust‚Äôve been some damn good daydream, then. I don‚Äôt usually see you all starry-eyed. What‚Äôs going on in that thick skull of yours?‚Äù¬†

I think about telling him about the aquarium memory, but what‚Äôs the point? Denny wouldn‚Äôt get it. In fact, he‚Äôd probably laugh at me. He‚Äôs the type who lives minute-to-minute, always scheming, always chasing his next hustle. So, I just brush him off. ‚ÄúNothing. Just thinking about stuff.‚Äù¬†

‚Äú‚ÄòStuff‚Äô? Real specific there, buddy,‚Äù Denny says with a chuckle. He‚Äôs always pushing, always needling, but he knows when to back off. ‚ÄúWell, whatever it is, forget it. I know a spot where we can get a drink and maybe find some trouble to get into.‚Äù¬†

I shoot him a sideways glance. ‚ÄúNot in the mood, Denny. I just crawled off a bar floor, and I‚Äôm not in the mood for another round of ‚Äòwho wants to kill me tonight.‚Äô‚Äù¬†

Denny nods like he‚Äôs taking it seriously, but I can see the gears turning in his head. He lives for the dives, for the mess, for the chaos. ‚ÄúAlright, alright. I‚Äôll keep it classy. Promise.‚Äù He crosses his heart, like that means a damn thing.¬†

As we walk, he starts rambling about his latest scam‚Äîsomething involving fake IDs and rigged gambling machines. I let him talk, half-listening. My mind keeps drifting back to that aquarium memory. I‚Äôve seen it a hundred times, but I still don‚Äôt know why it sticks with me. There‚Äôs nothing special about it‚Äîno faces, no voices, just fish gliding in and out of view. But it‚Äôs mine, one of the last scraps of my real life that I haven‚Äôt sold off or buried.¬†

‚ÄúYo! You listening?‚Äù Denny snaps his fingers in front of my face, breaking me out of my thoughts. ‚ÄúI said we‚Äôre here.‚Äù¬†

We stop in front of a place that‚Äôs not quite a dive but not quite respectable either. Neon lights buzz over the door, flickering like they can‚Äôt decide whether to give up or keep going. The sign reads ‚ÄúThe Glass Tank.‚Äù Fitting, I guess. The irony isn‚Äôt lost on me, but I don‚Äôt mention it.¬†

‚ÄúAfter you, daydreamer,‚Äù Denny says with a smirk, pushing open the door.¬†

The inside is dim, smoky, with that mix of cheap booze and stale air that every bar in this part of town seems to have. It‚Äôs not packed, but there are enough people around to blend in without standing out. That‚Äôs the kind of place I like.¬†

We slide into a booth, and Denny orders us a couple of drinks. He‚Äôs already scanning the room, eyes darting from person to person, like he‚Äôs measuring them up for his next scam. I try to let the noise and the warmth of the bar drown out the thoughts gnawing at the back of my mind. But that memory‚Äîthose damn fish‚Äîwon‚Äôt let go. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre still floating somewhere in the back of my head, calm and silent while the rest of me spirals.¬†

‚ÄúHey, Earth to loser,‚Äù Denny says, snapping me out of it again. ‚ÄúI swear, man, you‚Äôre losing it.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I mutter, downing my drink. ‚ÄúBut at least I got something left to lose.‚Äù¬†

Denny raises his glass with a grin. ‚ÄúTo losing what little we‚Äôve got left!‚Äù¬†

I clink my glass against his, trying to push that aquarium memory back down where it belongs. But it lingers, soft and blurry, like the last bit of light before the darkness swallows everything whole.¬†

¬†

Chapter 4¬†

I wake up in a room that smells like sweat and stale cigarettes. My head feels like it‚Äôs been smashed with a brick, and I have no clue how I got here. Last thing I remember is grabbing drinks with Denny‚Äîafter that, nothing. Just a black hole where the night should be.¬†

I sit up, rubbing my temples, trying to force something out of my foggy brain, but it‚Äôs like hitting a brick wall. Nothing. Not even flashes. That‚Äôs not normal. I‚Äôve been blacked out before, but this? This is different. It‚Äôs like someone reached in and scooped out part of my memory.¬†

I grab my phone and call Denny. He always answers. Always. But it just rings and rings until voicemail picks up. ‚ÄúHey, this is Denny! Leave a‚Äî‚Äù I hang up before he can finish. Something‚Äôs off.¬†

I throw on my jacket and head out. First stop is the usual spots‚Äîplaces where Denny practically lives. But he‚Äôs not hustling drunks at the pool hall. Not chatting up the waitresses at that greasy diner. Not even posted up outside the corner store selling fake IDs to teenagers.¬†

As the sun starts dipping, I‚Äôm getting that gnawing feeling in my gut that I don‚Äôt like. I‚Äôm used to hunting people down for memory jobs, not chasing after my own friend. This is too close to home.¬†

It‚Äôs getting dark by the time I find him. He‚Äôs sitting on a bench near the park, just staring off into space. Relief hits me for half a second, but it‚Äôs quickly drowned by something else. Something cold. Denny doesn‚Äôt look right. He‚Äôs too still, too calm. Not twitchy, not checking his surroundings like he‚Äôs always doing. Something‚Äôs wrong.¬†

I walk up slow, hands in my pockets. ‚ÄúDenny. Hey.‚Äù¬†

He barely turns his head, eyes glazed over. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù¬†

My chest tightens. That single word hits me like a punch. Flat. Empty. Not Denny. I know what this is. I‚Äôve seen that look too many times. Hell, I‚Äôve put that look on people myself. He‚Äôs been wiped.¬†

But this wasn‚Äôt some quick grab like I usually do. This is deep. Like someone wanted him scrubbed clean.¬†

‚ÄúDenny, it‚Äôs me,‚Äù I say, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt remember last night?‚Äù¬†

He just stares, blinking slow like it‚Äôs taking all his effort to process what I‚Äôm saying. ‚ÄúSorry, man. I don‚Äôt know you.‚Äù¬†

And there it is. Whoever did this really did a number on him. I‚Äôm not shocked, not really. More pissed. Not just because Denny‚Äôs gone, but because whoever did this went deep enough to erase me from his head entirely.¬†

‚ÄúWho did this to you?‚Äù I mutter under my breath, knowing he doesn‚Äôt have the answer. But still, I can‚Äôt help it. I‚Äôm running through my mental list of suspects, thinking about who‚Äôd want to do this to him, or worse, who‚Äôd want to send me a message.¬†

Denny gets up, dusts off his pants like he‚Äôs ready to move on. ‚ÄúLook, I gotta get going. If you need something, I can‚Äôt help you.‚Äù¬†

I watch him walk away like I‚Äôm nothing more than a stranger asking for change. It‚Äôs a knife twist, but I push it down. I‚Äôve been around too long to get sentimental. Still, as he disappears into the dark, I know this isn‚Äôt over. Whoever wiped Denny and took whatever they took from me wants to play, and I‚Äôve got no choice but to play along. But I‚Äôm not some tough guy. I‚Äôll pick my fights when they make sense and back off when they don‚Äôt.¬†

Right now, though? I don‚Äôt know which one this is.¬†

I light a cigarette and stand there for a while, letting the smoke curl up into the night sky. I‚Äôm not about to go charging in guns blazing. That‚Äôs a quick way to end up in a ditch. First, I need information. And I need it fast, before Denny‚Äôs trail goes cold.¬†

I take one last drag, flick the butt to the ground, and head off into the night. Someone has to have a memory of us last night. If they don‚Äôt talk‚Äîwell, I have my ways.¬†

¬†

Chapter 5¬†

I. Need. Fucking. Coffee.¬†

I feel like shit. Between getting my ass handed to me, partying too hard, losing chunks of my memory, and spending a whole day chasing after Denny, I‚Äôm running on fumes. And fuck‚ÄîI almost forgot about that prick who tried to stomp my head in at Charlie‚Äôs. If he‚Äôs the one behind all this, he‚Äôs a goddamn idiot. Should‚Äôve wiped the memory of him too if he had any brains.¬†

I drag myself out of bed, every muscle aching. I should track down Georgette, see if that psycho went after her too. I can‚Äôt afford to sit on this. I need to stay hot on the trail, get back whatever the hell he took from me and Denny.¬†

But first‚Äîcoffee. A cup of the blackest, strongest sludge I can find.¬†

I yawn, glancing at the clock. Eleven in the morning. On my schedule, that‚Äôs like waking up at 4 AM for a normal human being. Too damn early for this shit.¬†

I throw on some clothes and head out, the city‚Äôs noise hitting me like a wall as soon as I step outside. The air‚Äôs thick with exhaust and the smell of burnt food from a street vendor nearby. Normally, I wouldn‚Äôt even notice, but today, something feels off. It‚Äôs like the city‚Äôs got eyes‚Äîhundreds of them‚Äîall on me.¬†

As I walk, I can‚Äôt shake the feeling. It‚Äôs crawling up my spine, making my skin itch. I glance over my shoulder, but there‚Äôs no one there. Still, I can‚Äôt get rid of this gnawing sense that I‚Äôm being watched. It‚Äôs like everyone on the street is staring at me, even though they‚Äôre not. Paranoia‚Äôs a bitch, but I‚Äôve learned not to ignore it.¬†

Lost in my thoughts, I don‚Äôt notice the bum until I‚Äôm practically on top of him. We collide, and he stumbles, cursing as he goes down.¬†

‚ÄúWatch where you‚Äôre fucking going, you idiot!‚Äù he slurs, waving a half-empty bottle in my direction.¬†

‚ÄúSorry, man,‚Äù I mumble, but I‚Äôm already backing away, the anxiety turning into full-blown panic. I need to move. Now.¬†

I take off down the street, half-jogging, half-running, trying to shake the feeling that something‚Äôs closing in on me. My heart‚Äôs pounding, and it‚Äôs not just from the run. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I felt this rattled.¬†

When I finally slow down, I‚Äôm standing in front of Georgette‚Äôs building. My breath catches in my throat. As I walk into the brick building, I head down the hallway towards her place. There‚Äôs yellow police tape crisscrossed over her apartment door, the kind that screams ‚ÄúKeep Out.‚Äù My stomach drops.¬†

A neighbor walks by, sweating like a pig even with the AC running in this place, and I catch her arm. ‚ÄúWhat happened here?‚Äù¬†

She glances at my hand on her arm, then at my face. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt hear? Georgette‚Ä¶she killed herself two nights ago. Left a note and everything.‚Äù She spit out as she wrenched her arm from my grip.¬†

Her words hit me like a punch to the gut. I stand there, numb, trying to process it. Two nights ago? That‚Äôs when everything went to shit.¬†

I just stand there, staring at the tape, shock and disbelief twisting into a cold, hard knot in my gut. This wasn‚Äôt an accident. I know it wasn‚Äôt. But if someone wiped Denny and Georgette‚Äôs gone, then what the hell am I dealing with?¬†

¬†

Chapter 6¬†

I have to find that fucking guy from the other night. Georgette usually keeps ‚Äúsouvenirs‚Äù of the guys we hustle. A watch, a wallet, maybe a credit card. I mean, it‚Äôs not like they even remember they ever owned it. And if they do, what are they gonna do, call the cops?¬†

I peek down the hallway. It‚Äôs empty, nobody in sight. Good. I move quickly to Georgette‚Äôs door, the yellow police tape crisscrossed over it like a sick joke. The tape‚Äôs meant to keep people out, but let‚Äôs be real‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt exactly a high-security setup.¬†

I peel back the tape, just enough to slip inside without drawing attention, and push the door open. The apartment‚Äôs nice, surprisingly so. Clean, everything in order. Business must‚Äôve been good for her. Figures. While I‚Äôm out here getting my face smashed in, Georgette‚Äôs been living it up.¬†

The place feels almost too normal, which makes it worse somehow. I start searching, checking the usual spots: drawers, under the mattress. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just the regular clutter of someone who‚Äôs careful but not paranoid. I move into the bathroom, and that‚Äôs where the reality hits.¬†

There‚Äôs blood spatter by the tub with those little yellow evidence things next to it, and a trail of it going up the side of the bath. Inside the bath is a pinkish stain about three quarters up the bath, right to where the water level must‚Äôve been. They must not have sent their cleaning crew yet. Shit. Must‚Äôve been slit wrists in the bath. I didn‚Äôt need to see this. The air feels thicker in here, heavy with the stench of something final. Did Georgette actually do this to herself, or did someone else decide to close the book on her?¬†

My mind‚Äôs racing, trying to piece together what the fuck actually happened. But before I get too lost in the grim scene, something catches my eye‚Äîone of those old-school vents near the floor, the kind where the cover pulls out. Exactly the type of spot someone might stash something they don‚Äôt want found.¬†

I pull off the cover, and sure enough, there‚Äôs a stash inside. A couple of small baggies of what looks like coke, a few thousand bucks in small bills‚Äîfives, tens, twenties‚Äîplus a stack of IDs and credit cards. No shit. Georgette was better at this than I thought. She even took the licenses, probably to use the billing addresses for online shopping sprees. Smart girl.¬†

I pocket the drugs and the cash‚Äîmight need that later‚Äîand start sifting through the cards. Most of them are forgettable, just random schmucks who crossed paths with us and we took some memories they probably won‚Äôt even realize they‚Äôre missing. But then I find it. The ID of the big guy from the other night. The one who tried to turn my face into a pancake.¬†

Bingo. Now we‚Äôre getting somewhere.¬†

I stand there for a moment, card in hand, staring at his face. The guy looks like a meathead even in his photo, all grimace and no brains. But this isn‚Äôt just about revenge. If he‚Äôs tied up in this, if he‚Äôs the one who wiped Denny and maybe even had something to do with Georgette‚Äôs death, then I need to find him. And fast.¬†

But for now, I slip the ID into my pocket, my mind already running through the next steps. Whatever happened, whatever the hell this is turning into, it‚Äôs not gonna be pretty. But at least I‚Äôve got a lead.¬†

Now it‚Äôs time to see where it takes me.¬†

¬†

Chapter 7¬†

I rush to the small storage unit where I keep my stash, half in a daze but forcing myself to stay sharp. I can‚Äôt afford to be sloppy‚Äînot with everything that‚Äôs been going on. So I go through the motions, like muscle memory, using the misdirection tactics I‚Äôve relied on for years. I stop to check if anyone‚Äôs following me, take a few wrong turns, double back. Finally, I reach my destination‚Äîa shitty indoor storage facility that‚Äôs as rundown as it is anonymous.¬†

I slam through the door and race down the dimly lit corridor to my unit. The metal door creaks as I roll it up, revealing my barebones setup inside. A cheap fold-up table, a battered chair, the memory glasses, and a few flash drives‚Äîthe ones I haven‚Äôt sold yet. David‚Äôs memories from the other night are still on the glasses, waiting for me to sift through them and find buyers.¬†

I set up quickly, my fingers twitching with a mix of frustration and urgency. I need answers, and I need them now. Maybe there‚Äôs something in David‚Äôs memories that‚Äôll point me in the right direction, something that‚Äôll explain why everything‚Äôs gone to shit.¬†

I slide on the glasses and start diving into the memories. It‚Äôs the usual sentimental crap‚Äîfamily dinners, date nights, and playing catch with one of his daughters in the backyard. The kind of memories that sell well on the black market because they make shitty people feel better about themselves, like they were the ones with the good life. But there‚Äôs nothing here that gives me any real answers, nothing that connects him to what‚Äôs been happening to me, Denny, or Georgette. Just more of the same boring, suburban shit.¬†

Fuck. Wasted time. I could‚Äôve been out there, tracking down the real threat, but instead, I got sidetracked by this guy. I can‚Äôt stop, I have to keep moving. This prick took it too far.¬†

I pocket the glasses and the flash drives, then head out of the storage unit, locking it up behind me. My next stop is David‚Äôs house, and I‚Äôm not leaving until I get some answers.¬†

This asshole‚Äôs house is exactly what I imagined from a guy like him. Big, nice, and flashy.¬† There‚Äôs a shiny SUV parked in the driveway. A family car, no doubt. The whole setup screams suburban bliss, but I know better. Beneath all this polish is a guy who gets his kicks by doing things that would make his neighbors' skin crawl.¬†

I feel myself getting more and more pissed as I soak it all in, and I can hardly contain it as I walk up to this asshole‚Äôs door.¬† I reach out to ring the doorbell, but before I can, the door swings open.¬†

David‚Äôs there, stepping out with a smile on his face, muttering a casual goodbye to someone inside. But when he turns and sees me standing there, his expression changes in an instant. The smile drops, replaced by a look of surprise that quickly turns into anger.¬†

‚ÄúDavid,‚Äù I say, voice low and cold, as I cock my fist back to hit him.¬†

But he‚Äôs faster. His fist connects with my jaw before I even see it coming. Pop! The world spins, and pain explodes through my head as I crumple to the ground. Damn, he‚Äôs fast. And hits harder than I probably do too. Everything goes black, but not before I feel him grabbing me, dragging me across the rough pavement towards his car.¬†

I come to in the passenger seat, my head pounding like a drum. The seatbelt is wrapped around me a few times and buckled in, not tight enough to trap me but snug enough that David‚Äôs got the upper hand if I try something. My vision‚Äôs still blurry, but I can hear him muttering angrily as he drives.¬†

‚ÄúThis is bullshit,‚Äù he growls, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. ‚ÄúNow they‚Äôre showing up at my fucking home? My home?‚Äù He notices me stirring and glances over, his eyes narrowing.¬†

Screeeeech! He slams on the brakes, and my body jumps forward, the seatbelt snapping tight across my chest. My head whips forward, then back, the belt locking up as it digs into my shoulder. Fuck man, I can‚Äôt catch a break.¬†

Lurch reaches for me. I try to throw my hand up, but I can only move from my elbows down. ‚ÄúWhoa whoa whoa! Wait a fucking second!‚Äù Man, I sound like a bitch. But I need to get my wits back, so whatever works I guess.¬†

He hesitates, his breath coming in harsh, angry bursts, but he doesn‚Äôt hit me again. Instead, he glares at me, his eyes full of paranoia and rage. ‚ÄúYou think you can just show up at my house? Do you know who I am? Do you have any idea what I could do to you?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I get it,‚Äù I say, trying to stay calm despite the pain in my head. ‚ÄúBig guy, nice house, little dick. You‚Äôve got it all, right? I just need to know what the hell happened the other night.‚Äù¬†

His expression darkens further, and his grip tightens on the wheel. ‚ÄúThe other night? You mean when you and that bitch got in my head?‚Äù His voice is low and dangerous. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm stupid? You think I don‚Äôt know what you did?‚Äù¬†

I raise an eyebrow, playing along. ‚ÄúWhat do you think is happening now?‚Äù¬†

He leans in closer, his face inches from mine, his eyes wild with suspicion. ‚ÄúYou and that Irish prick? You‚Äôre in on it together, trying to take me out. Make me disappear. I know how this works.‚Äù¬†

I blink, genuinely confused. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you talking about?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bullshit me!‚Äù he snaps, veins bulging in his neck. ‚ÄúYou think I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on? You‚Äôre here to finish the job, but you fucked up. You showed up at my house!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLook, man,‚Äù I say, trying to defuse the situation. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to finish anything. I‚Äôm just trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on. Denny‚Äôs been wiped, Georgette‚Äôs dead, and now you‚Äôre acting like I‚Äôm part of some hit squad.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDenny?¬† Who‚Äôs dead??‚Äù David‚Äôs confusion is genuine, and I start to see the cracks in his tough-guy facade. He doesn‚Äôt know who Denny is. I‚Äôm starting to believe he‚Äôs not involved in this. He‚Äôs just another paranoid asshole caught up in something bigger than he understands.¬†

‚ÄúDid you kill her?‚Äù¬†

His grip on the wheel loosens slightly, and he leans back, the fight draining out of him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not here to take me out? I didn‚Äôt kill anyone. I just want my shit back. I DIDN‚ÄôT KILL ANYONE!!‚Äù He almost sounds like a wild animal at the end, half yell, half wail.¬†

For a moment, the car is silent, just the sound of our breathing filling the space. David‚Äôs still on edge, but the realization is starting to sink in‚Äîhe‚Äôs not the target, just another dumbass.¬†

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what now?‚Äù he finally asks, his voice low and uncertain.¬†

‚ÄúNow?‚Äù I consider my next move. ‚ÄúGet me the fuck out of this car and you‚Äôll never see me again.‚Äù¬†

David hesitates, but then he nods slowly, shifting the car back into park finally. He unclicks my seatbelt, and I awkwardly unravel myself. Before I open the door, I reach into my pocket and pull out the flash drive and the stack of cards. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù I say, handing the copy I made over. ‚ÄúYour shit. Consider it a peace offering.‚Äù¬†

He looks at the items in his hand, then back at me, suspicion creeping back into his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù¬†

I lean back in the seat, still nursing the pain in my head. ‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt want you coming after me again. And because you‚Äôre not my problem anymore.‚Äù¬†

David‚Äôs still skeptical, but he doesn‚Äôt argue. He pockets the items, his grip on the wheel relaxing just a little. I get out of the car and just start running. Screw this shit, I‚Äôm not giving him a chance to hit me again.¬†

¬†

Chapter 8¬†

I‚Äôm beat. My head‚Äôs pounding, my ribs feel like they‚Äôve been through a meat grinder, and I‚Äôm not even sure which direction I‚Äôm walking anymore. Everything around me‚Äôs a blur‚Äîneon lights, the hum of traffic, people moving like shadows. I‚Äôve been running on fumes for days, and it‚Äôs catching up to me. But I can‚Äôt stop now. Stopping means thinking, and thinking means facing all the shit that‚Äôs gone down. Denny‚Äôs gone, Georgetta‚Äôs dead, and David... well, I‚Äôm lucky I‚Äôm not a smear on his driveway right now.¬†

I know I need a plan, something better than stumbling around hoping for a miracle. But the truth is, I‚Äôm out of my depth. I‚Äôve always been good at surviving‚Äîscraping by, bullshitting my way through tight spots. But this? This is different. This is big. Too big for me to handle alone.¬†

And that‚Äôs when it hits me.¬†

There‚Äôs one guy I know who might have a clue about what the hell‚Äôs going on‚ÄîDM. Yeah, Dungeon Master. Don‚Äôt ask, it‚Äôs his thing. Weird, but the dude‚Äôs a genius when it comes to tech. He built my memory glasses, and if anyone knows what‚Äôs up with this whole mess, it‚Äôs him.¬†

DM‚Äôs place isn‚Äôt far. I can use some of the cash I got from Georgetta‚Äôs place and catch an Uber there. He‚Äôs got a decent setup‚Äîa nice house in a quiet neighborhood, the kind that screams ‚Äúsuburban bliss.‚Äù He made bank on the black market, enough to buy the house when his mom lost hers. He lets her live there, but he stays in the basement, because of course he does. It‚Äôs what he knows.¬†

I pull out my phone and put in for a ride. I need to know what the hell‚Äôs going on, and DM‚Äôs the best shot I‚Äôve got. Even if he is a nerd with more action figures than friends.¬†

I have the driver drop me off a few blocks away and trek the rest of the way there. When the house finally comes into view, I begin to feel a little better. It‚Äôs quiet, streetlights illuminating every dark corner of the street. The type of neighborhood where if you mow your lawn too late in the evening someone will call the cops. No need to worry about too much craziness happening here, hopefully. I cut across the lawn and head for the side door that leads down to the basement. No need to bother his mom‚Äîshe‚Äôs sweet, but I‚Äôm not in the mood for small talk.¬†

I knock twice‚Äîour usual signal‚Äîthen push the door open and head down. The smell hits me first: a mix of Red Bull, chips, and that musty basement air. The walls are plastered with posters‚Äîvideo games, anime girls, and some plastic armor and other cosplay shit. Shelves are lined with tech parts, but it‚Äôs all pretty tidy, considering. DM‚Äôs in the middle of the room, VR headset on, swinging around like he‚Äôs in some epic battle.¬†

‚ÄúYo, DM!‚Äù I shout over the sounds of the game. ‚ÄúStop playing with your virtual girl for a sec, we gotta talk.‚Äù¬†

He doesn‚Äôt hear me, too deep in whatever virtual hell he‚Äôs fighting. I walk over and give him a shove. ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù¬†

He stumbles, pulls off the headset, and glares at me. ‚ÄúWhat the hell, man? I‚Äôm in the middle of a friggen battle.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah? Well, I‚Äôm in the middle of a real-life shitstorm, so put your toys away. We need to talk. Georgetta‚Äôs dead and Denny is half-wiped.‚Äù¬†

I watch DM‚Äôs expression change from annoyed to curious. He has no clue who Georgetta and Denny are, but I know mentioning this will get his interest. He‚Äôs always warning me about Big Brother watching and all that bullshit, saying if I wasn‚Äôt careful, they‚Äôd be after me. Mostly a load of crap, but DM is smart. He knows people who know things, even if he gets carried away sometimes.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, man. Were you followed here?‚Äù DM always asks this whenever I visit, usually because me coming over means we‚Äôre doing some illegal shit.¬†

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think so. I got dropped off a few blocks away, walked to the mini-mart, and got some pizza before I came here.‚Äù¬†

Even before I finish talking, DM presses some buttons on his keyboard, replacing the half-naked cartoon girl on his monitor with six different camera angles around the house. You can see all the entrances and any incoming traffic. I watch him wince as headlights come into view and let out a sigh of relief as they don‚Äôt even slow down and pass his house. Paranoid.¬†

‚ÄúDM, I need some help.‚Äù I fill him in on the last few nights, starting from stealing some memories from the big guy up until showing up at his basement lair. He‚Äôs sitting there, eyes wide open. Occasionally peeking at his camera, then right back to me.¬†

‚ÄúFuck, man. I warned you to be careful with this tech. The glasses I gave you aren‚Äôt traceable, but people talk. A lot.‚Äù He swivels back to his keyboard and presses some other buttons that send the cameras to the flat-screen TV on the wall, then opens up some pictures of a building. ‚ÄúIf they find out you have been doing memory alterations, they‚Äôll come at you. Hard. And I‚Äôm not going down with you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs they?‚Äù I ask as I walk up to the monitor, looking at the picture for any clue of whatever the hell is going on.¬†

‚ÄúArchon.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is Archon?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been talking to this guy that works for Archon. They‚Äôre technically a pharmaceutical company funded by the government. They have this place right here, which is a rehab center for the mentally handicapped. It‚Äôs a front. My guy tells me most of the people here are actually test dummies who have been wiped so hard, they can‚Äôt even wipe their own asses anymore. They‚Äôre basically babies who have forgotten even how to talk and have to relearn everything.‚Äù¬†

I really hope this is more of his bull because this is getting way too deep for someone like me. I‚Äôm no Jason Bourne. ‚ÄúShit. Do you think they have anything to do with me?‚Äù¬†

DM kinda rolls his eyes at me. ‚ÄúArchon has everything to do with anything memory tech related. They are trying to rehab the image of memory manipulation, pushing new tech to make it safer and legal again. But it‚Äôs not safer. The old stuff, like what you have, all you can really do is look at things like a recording. You can download and import memories, but that‚Äôs it. And not core memories, like things you are taught. Just things like the first slice of pizza you ever had.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúTo do what they are doing, you need some serious money and tech. Wiping someone down to where they forget how to chew food? That‚Äôs hardcore shit there. If they can do that, they can probably also alter memories.‚Äù DM continued.¬†

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù I mutter. ‚ÄúSo, what am I supposed to do about it? This isn‚Äôt exactly my usual hustle.‚Äù¬†

DM turns to face me, his expression serious. ‚ÄúLook, you want answers? You need to find out who‚Äôs involved and why. My guy inside mentioned that they‚Äôre ramping up operations at the facility. New tech, new experiments. If you really want to know what‚Äôs going on, you‚Äôre gonna have to get inside. Maybe you‚Äôll find something that links back to what happened to you‚Äîor at least point you in the right direction.‚Äù¬†

I look at him like he‚Äôs lost his damn mind. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me to break into a government-run facility? You think I‚Äôm some kind of superhero?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo, I think you‚Äôre a guy who doesn‚Äôt have a lot of options left,‚Äù DM says, deadpan. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs your call. You can keep running, or you can find out what the hell‚Äôs really going on.‚Äù¬†

I sigh, knowing he‚Äôs right. I‚Äôm in this deep already, might as well go all the way. ‚ÄúFine. How do I get in?‚Äù¬†

DM grins, the gleam of excitement in his eyes. ‚ÄúLeave that to me. But first... Hey, Ma! More Red Bulls! I‚Äôm about to blow this guy‚Äôs mind!‚Äù¬†",0,1728613637.0,CreativeQuill,0,0.5,False

Taxonomic Designation: Artiomoloch baxterii.

Gender: Male.

Height: 61 meters.

Length: 80 meters.

Wingspan: 97 meters.

Behavior: Protector.

Nature: Bio-Piezokinetic.

Place of Apparition: Hohensalzburg Fortress, Austria.

Current Location: B√°varo Forest, Germany.

State: Active.


Mythology / Criptozoology:
The Peryton is a fictional animal that combines the characteristics of a deer and a bird. It is believed to have its origin in a book by Jos√© Luis Borges about imaginary beings, although he also based his descriptions on a lost medieval manuscript. It was often depicted as a creature that was deer-like from the waist forward and bird-like from the waist back, including legs, tail and wings. Borges wrote that the Perytons' shadow when flying was similar to that of a man, and that they were highly involved in the fall of the Roman Empire. Another similar myth that is strongly linked to this one is that of Eik√æyrnir - whose name means ""He who has oak horns"" - a deer from Norse mythology that, together with the goat Hei√∞r√∫n, feeds on the leaves of the L√¶ra√∞r tree in Valhalla. At first we believed that these myths and the titan itself were highly linked to Furfur, so there was not much research into it.  But as of a few days ago we have changed our minds, as Furfur could not have even remotely inspired the myths that portray this being as a benevolent and peaceful entity, and with seismic readings from Austria a week ago we have determined that this being is definitely a totally different and separate being from Titanus Furfur.
The royal titan woke up a few days ago in Austria and caused panic due to its sudden awakening, but luckily it did absolutely nothing to hurt people and just went to the Bavarian Forest in Germany, where it remains quiet for now.

Fact:
The royal titan is itself a totally strange and abnormal life form, to start with it is not even a deer but rather a distant relative of the Stygimoloch, which evolved to be a mammal and headed towards a more aerial lifestyle.
Starting off, its front arms have evolved to be even longer in order to give the creature the ability to walk on all fours;  But that's not all, the arms have developed to such an extent that they have become wings similar to those of a Pteranodon that are fully capable of propelling it through the air without any problem despite its size. These front arms have three claws similar to those of a feline and despite walking almost like a Pteranodon, its way of walking is not affected at all. Being able to walk like a normal quadruped mammal despite this. 
The titan is covered with pastel yellow fur on top and coffee-brown fur below, which is dense and thick enough to protect it from both the cold and other types of attacks from external aggressors. 
As for its hind legs, these have evolved to more closely resemble those of a cervid, even fusing its claws into hooves similar to those of a deer or a horse. The same legs are equipped with strong and rigid muscles that have enough strength to give an amazing kick that can end a life in a single instant. 
 It has a short, very furry tail that has no apparent function, but the titan can move it in a dog-like manner to indicate that it is happy or content, or raise it and leave it completely rigid to indicate that it is seeing something that may mean a serious and severe threat. 
Like its extinct relative, Peryton has the same bony dome as the Stygimoloch, which is heavily armored and reinforced and helps it to deliver powerful headbutts to its opponents. Likewise, its horns can also develop in a similar way to those of a deer. Being lacking them during its infancy, appearing in it for the first time during its youth, developing them further during its adulthood and completing their development by splintering when it reaches the position of a leader of the species in the adult stage. These horns that it has are splintered in different parts, which gives it the appearance of deer antlers. 
 As a final note, the titan is capable of absorbing the energy coming from blows and impacts towards its person, and is capable of accumulating them in one part as well as dispersing them to other parts to finally release them in the form of a terrible kick or a powerful headbutt that ends up killing or seriously stunning its opponent. 
Fortunately, the titan seems to be peaceful with humans as well as with the environment, but it will undoubtedly attack if it sees something that makes it feel threatened, such as another titan or some carnivorous or predatory specimen in the area. For now it lies wandering through the Bavarian Forest in Germany and I would say that everything is fine, but the truth is that I doubt it very much since since yesterday the titan has been staring intently at the sky pointing towards the Northwest, a fact that makes us worry and wonder what it is that can draw its attention so much or leave it so pensive.

Me: 28M

  
Her: 24F

  
2-months

¬†

I (28m) just started a graduate program in another state. I don‚Äôt have any friends or family in the area, and it has been difficult. I met another student (24f) in my program back in August, and we seemed to really click. However, midway in September, she got weird. She hurt my feelings a few times, but I can‚Äôt tell if I may be overly sensitive or if maybe I‚Äôm the reason why it happened.

¬†

I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder last year from a psychologist and two separate psychiatrists. It‚Äôs been a lifelong struggle of mine since at least 10 years old when I began having recurring suicidal thoughts that I‚Äôve dealt with my entire life, but I think even earlier than that based on my parents‚Äô observations of me. The anxiety and depression made it extremely difficult for me to fit into social situations, and my parents eventually took me out of traditional school and placed me in a distance learning program, so I had even less social interactions with other people after that. I think I may have PTSD as well, but I am not sure. My biggest comfort was binge eating, so I became morbidly obese, and I‚Äôve had extremely low self-esteem for my entire life because of my appearance; I lost weight after figuring out a low-glycemic diet that worked for me, but I am still not happy with how I look. I am 6‚Äô3‚Äù 220, but I seem to still have a very high body-fat percentage, and I also suffer from gynecomastia, which has made me hate my body since I was about 6 and people made fun of me at swimming pools. I also have many stretch marks.

¬†

I didn‚Äôt spend time around people until I started my undergraduate, but I found that being around people in college was too difficult and stressful. I couldn‚Äôt form social relationships with other people because of my anxious thinking; my previous psychologist said that I was hyperaware from having untreated anxiety for such a long time in my life. She told me that it was my attempt to protect myself, but every social interaction that I‚Äôve ever had followed a similar pattern: I would meet someone, try really hard to get them to like me, eventually see signs that were not overtly positive that made me think that they disliked me, and then I would pull back so that I wouldn‚Äôt annoy them. Then they would never try to follow up with me and the connection would die out. This happened continuously, both in undergraduate, when I studied abroad, when I worked, and when I went into the Peace Corps.

¬†

I‚Äôve had some friendships and people I‚Äôve connected with, but eventually I always end up feeling like I‚Äôm a burden and that they‚Äôd be happier without me in their lives. The longest friendship I had was for about 5-years with a guy I met in my last year of college. The difference seemed to be that he was really good about continuously reaching out to me and following up, so that I didn‚Äôt need to feel like I was pestering him. Eventually, though, I got into a really bad depressive episode and ended up blocking him because I was embarrassed about my life and didn‚Äôt want him to know that I had lost my job. I wanted to disconnect so that I didn‚Äôt feel so vulnerable.

¬†

I‚Äôve been really scared about taking medicine, but a few months ago, I started Lexapro under a psychiatrist‚Äôs care. I found that it helped an extreme amount with my depression and anxious thinking. I‚Äôve never in my life not had at least a day out of my week where I felt extremely depressed and had at least a general thought of ‚Äòwhy am I alive? I should kill myself.‚Äô After starting the medication, I started feeling incredibly better, and so many things seemed easier. I started the medication because after a year of CBT, I still wasn‚Äôt feeling great and I was going to start this graduate program, so I wanted to try something more to get me over the hump.

¬†

When I moved in August for my graduate program, I attended an orientation event with a group of students in my program. Whereas before everything was a focus on ‚Äòwhat do I say now? Did I say the right thing? Did they think it was funny? What else should I be doing? What do I do now? Where do I sit? Should I say I had a great time or just leave? Do they think I‚Äôm weird? Did I do the right thing? Did I say too much?‚Äô the anxious thoughts weren‚Äôt at the forefront of my mind and I was able to just be. I thought that I was a completely changed person and it seemed incredibly different than what I was used to experiencing. I hung out with most of the people at least once or twice after that, attended a party, and also did a few other things, but I also really connected with this girl that I met in the orientation event too.

¬†

My previous psychologist told me not to connect overly much with anyone in my graduate program because it is a professional program and those individuals may one day be your coworkers or bosses, so treat them like colleagues and not friends. I‚Äôm a first-generation college graduate, so I have no experience with anything in academia, but I tried to follow this advice. However, the girl was insistent and kept trying to talk to me, and then she mentioned she was a huge fan of this guitarist that I liked too. We started talking and we started sharing music with each other, and it turned out that she had a lot of similar music tastes as me. Over the next few weeks in August, we texted almost every single day for hours at a time, she had a similar sense of humor as me and we shared a bunch of jokes, and I formed a crush on her. I felt that a lot of times that we were flirting with the way that she would look at me and the general demeanor of the jokes as being something that felt more than just friendly but more intimate and playful. It‚Äôs hard to say, though, because I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience, but it really did feel like more than just friendly. I also took her out for coffee to celebrate her getting a promotion at work.

¬†

Eventually we went out a couple of times together, we never called each other friend or anything like that or had a definitive term for each other, but I found myself really enjoying being around her. Then our program started and the first day I saw her and waved and said ‚Äòhello‚Äô and she ignored me. Then a few days later I saw her again, waved at her and said hi when she was right next to me, and she didn‚Äôt acknowledge me at all. I also didn‚Äôt hear from her at all during those first week days.

¬†

It really threw me off and deeply hurt my feelings because some of the other people I had met did that too. It was like everyone flipped a switch from before school started where everyone was open and friendly and then when it started everyone became really closed off, cliquey and rude. I felt really whiplashed, but especially from her reaction.

¬†

Then that Saturday she sent me about twelve texts talking about wanting to do all of these things together with me and I got confused. I told her that she had hurt my feelings, and she apologized and said she didn‚Äôt mean to do that, but that she still wanted to spend time with me. We ended up hanging out the next weekend because she had to cancel for those Sunday plans we had. She said she got an ear infection because she was a college swimmer, so I got her some swimmer ear plugs to protect her ears in the future. She met me at a caf√© for coffee on Sunday, and we went to a record store where I purchased her a handful of records since she had lost most of hers in her move. It wasn‚Äôt much money, but I thought it would be nice; I also got her this goofy Sesame Street album as a joke too.

¬†

She took me back to her apartment where we ended up sitting listening to records together for a few hours. The first one we played was the Sesame Street album and it apparently wasn‚Äôt lined up correctly or something and let out this horrible shriek. I thought it was hilarious and we joked about it; I told her she had to keep the cursed album now and that she was going to become haunted from it. She also told me about this guy she was kind of seeing from before but that she had fallen out of contact with, and then she told me ‚ÄòI want to know you‚Äô and she wanted to hear about me and what was going on with me. She also kept talking about how guys were constantly trying to date her and stuff like that too and how these European guys at the local bar kept hitting on her and all of these guys she met internationally kept saying it was impossible not to fall in love with her. Eventually she ended up cooking me dinner, which I helped to make, and then we watched some television and part of a movie together before she had to do these swim tryouts. I went with her so that she had someone there to root for her, and afterwards she said she wanted to take me out for icecream. We spent the entire day together and it felt completely easy and fun; there was no awkwardness or hangups, and she told me again that she wanted to do a bunch of things together with me, including taking dancing classes together. I walked her home and then told her bye, and she asked if I wanted my albums I bought, and I told her I got them for her. She seemed to get a tiny bit weird, but I just told her I wanted her to have them.

¬†

That night I sent her some texts that may have been a bit odd talking about how it was weird that I had basically made her make me dinner and that I was sorry about that, and that I shouldn‚Äôt have made her take the albums because I got weird in my head after I left and I was thinking about her reaction. I thought maybe I had overstepped and didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I sent her those texts, which I think may have been off-putting or weird. The next day, though, she seemed to change, and her texts seemed to be less open and easy. She also said that she wouldn‚Äôt do the dance class and that ‚Äòshe had to turn down a lot of people for things to keep her schedule‚Äô and the like. It was really weird and I wasn‚Äôt sure what had happened or what was up, but I didn‚Äôt press the issue. I eventually asked her if she wanted to see this new movie she mentioned together, and she agreed to go together that next Sunday.

¬†

During that week, though, she seemed different and less interested in texting me. I may have easily been over reading things because I also noticed I started to feel extremely anxious and depressed again after this, so I‚Äôm not sure I can trust how I saw everything. But it felt weird ‚Äì there were delays in responses whereas before she would text almost immediately back and we would have text conversations, and it just seemed a lot colder. I didn‚Äôt really understand why. Then Sunday came and I felt really odd, and when I picked her up she seemed super stiff. Again, it could have just been me, but it felt really uncomfortable and odd, like I shouldn‚Äôt speak. I read a short story before that said an interaction was ‚Äòlike glass between cotton balls,‚Äô and that‚Äôs what it felt like ‚Äì really precarious for some reason. She also seemed to really pointedly call me her ‚Äòfriend‚Äô too, which she never really did. The weirdest part, though, was that we got seats together for the movie, and then she purposefully moved down one so she wasn‚Äôt sitting directly next to me. It just seemed kind of odd and extremely deliberate, and I didn‚Äôt know why she did that. It just made the awkwardness even more awkward for me, like she didn‚Äôt want to be there or be around me.

¬†

She had had an interview earlier before the movie that same day and I had bought her favorite drink that we had been joking about together, and she said thank you and hugged me when I gave it to her when I dropped her off. That was the only point when she seemed to become warm and open again and felt like before. I felt extremely upset, however, and super confused as to what happened. I ended up texting her later asking if anything was up, and she said she thought there was something going on with me. I felt weird and I had been dealing with stress from how she had been acting the week prior, but I just told her that I really appreciated her because I hadn‚Äôt connected with anyone like her and that I was really struggling socially to find anyone I liked. She said she really appreciated having our friendship again and that ‚Äòwe were friends‚Äô and stuff like that. It seemed like she kept pointedly mentioning that.

¬†

Eventually she invited me out to this concert that Thursday, but I didn‚Äôt see the invitation until it was about to begin. I went there to meet her and texted her, and then she told me she had also invited this other guy. Initially she said she was going to the concert directly after class, but she got there late and when she got there, she was wearing high heels, a low cut dress, and perfume and makeup on, and all of this other stuff. I had gotten us seats at the front, and she came to sit with me. When the other person arrived, though, she immediately told me that ‚Äòhe wanted to sit in the back so she was going to move.‚Äô She didn‚Äôt invite me to go with her or anything, and I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I followed her. The guy didn‚Äôt introduce himself to me, and when we were going to sit down, she deliberately moved to sit directly next to him and left a gap between myself and her again. It really threw me off because I didn‚Äôt know why she would have invited me to this if she was on a date or didn‚Äôt want me there. She also mentioned that her and this guy had been doing a lot of stuff together and while I was sitting there, they were making plans together in front of me without inviting me to them.

¬†

Her and the guy spent the entire time talking to each other and no one said a word to me for the rest of the concert. After it ended, we left and it seemed pretty clear that she and him were going to continue hanging out. I left and sent her a text saying sorry and that I didn‚Äôt realize, but not anything about her ‚Äòbeing on a date.‚Äô The concert ended at 8pm and at about 11pm she texted me saying some stuff but most importantly ‚Äòthere‚Äôs nothing there!!!‚Äô like that, and it seemed extremely defensive or embarrassed to me, like she had been caught or something weird. It just really completely hurt my feelings to have someone I thought that I had gotten close with to suddenly switch like that and treat me like she did ‚Äì I‚Äôd never treat anyone like that unless they had done something really horrible to me. I became completely depressed and suicidal despite my Lexapro. She had also suggested getting together on Sunday before the concert, but after the concert, I texted her that I had to cancel.

¬†

The next week I ended up texting her after thinking maybe I was too sensitive and she never responded. I then texted her two days in a row and she still never responded until two days after on Friday. She just sent a generic text saying she had been busy, but I had asked her a bunch of questions on how she was and what she was doing like before with some jokes, and she didn‚Äôt respond at all to any of that. I just told her to enjoy her weekend.

¬†

A week later she randomly texted me saying that ‚Äòshe knew I had been going through some things but that she was there if I wanted to talk,‚Äô and it just really made me angry. It was like she didn‚Äôt care at all about what she did at the concert or that she hadn‚Äôt been communicating or responding to me, and then she just sent me this random text about being busy and everything but how she‚Äôs ‚Äòthere for me‚Äô and stuff, and it just really upset me. It felt like I was an obligation and she had to say that so she wasn‚Äôt the bad guy. I told her not to worry about me and that she didn‚Äôt need to feel like she had to keep in touch with me.

¬†

It‚Äôs been over a week and I haven‚Äôt heard from her at all. I accidentally saw her a couple of times and she was with all of these people laughing and seeming incredibly happy. It just really, really, really hurts because I haven‚Äôt really met people that I‚Äôve connected to, especially a girl. I‚Äôm a virgin because of my non-existent self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and deep seated self-loathing. It‚Äôs like my brain is in two-halves and one side realizes that it wasn‚Äôt really anything, but then the other part has this hugely deep hole of grief. I keep getting waves of feeling overwhelmed and then I sob uncontrollably. I became attached too hard or read too deeply into things because of my mental disorders, but I really thought that she seemed to like me romantically. It just seemed like suddenly there was a switch and I don‚Äôt know why; I‚Äôm not sure if I was the one who was wrong.

¬†

I just feel suicidally depressed because I really was hoping my life was going to be different this time, especially with the Lexapro and CBT I had been doing. I just got in to see a new psychologist because my old one was out of state, but I just feel horrid, like I have this deep, deep grief even though objectively it doesn‚Äôt seem like this deserves it. I think it may be partly PTSD because of the number of similar situations that have happened in the past, so I think maybe those similar feelings that I never adequately dealt with are coming up with this one too.

¬†

It just feels like no one ever notices my absence, or that they prefer it. I keep seeing all of these people with all of their friends, and I just don‚Äôt know why that is never me. I thought I was going to be able to be different this time because of the help I had gotten for my anxiety and depression, but it‚Äôs all the same and now I‚Äôm back to being alone again in my room with no one to talk to or spend time with. I just don‚Äôt get why she treated me like that, and then I blame myself and then I wonder if maybe I‚Äôm being too sensitive and that she didn‚Äôt actually do anything wrong and that I was the weird one? I don‚Äôt really know because of my disorders making it feel hard to trust myself, but my psychologist told me that my feelings aren‚Äôt wrong and I can trust myself to understand social situations. It‚Äôs just confusing because I don‚Äôt know why all of this happened, and since it always seems to happen, I wonder if it‚Äôs my fault, or if maybe she was the one who knew what she was doing and that she really didn‚Äôt want me to be around?

¬†

The only thing I can think of is that she felt desperate, connected with me early on before the program started and she was still alone, and then when classes started she began hanging out with more people, and then she found people, like this guy, that she preferred, and then suddenly I wasn‚Äôt worth the time or effort anymore because she ‚Äòtraded up‚Äô to someone better. I had similar things happen in the past, and it seems to make the most sense to me, but I‚Äôm not sure if that sounds crazy or not. It seems like her suddenly calling me friend, deliberate efforts to do things like sit apart from me and keep me physically distant, the longer and longer times between texts, and stuff like that means she wasn‚Äôt interested in me and wanted to disconnect.

  
Just after that Sunday ‚Äòdate‚Äô we had, she seemed to change and got distant. Texts were longer and longer to receive, my jokes no longer seemed to make her amused, she seemed less interested in expending effort towards me, then the concert thing was really hurtful and completely rude in my opinion. Am I the one in the wrong here? Am I crazy? Or was she just a shallow person that I shouldn‚Äôt have gotten this wrapped up in? I guess I wish I could have that relationship from before back, but I think that was never real and just a front for her to feel connected. I don‚Äôt know why she would do that to me.

¬†

It feels horrible. Is it my fault?

  
TL;DR I have mental disorders. I met a girl that I thought was romantically interested in me. We seemed to connect in a really deep way. I thought we had a couple of dates together. Then she got distant and I didn't understand why. A really embarrassing experience happened when she invited me to a concert and it was clear she was on a date with another guy who came later. I ended up telling her she didn't need to feel obligated to stay in contact with me. She never texted me and she seemed to be really happy with friends when I see her.

1g0zkzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1g0zkzk/entitled_woman_who_thought_she_owned_the_park/,Entitled Woman Who Thought She Owned the Park ‚Äì Justice Served,"So this happened a few months ago, and I still think about it. It was one of those rare moments when the universe actually balances out a situation perfectly.

I live near a park where a lot of people from the neighborhood go to relax, walk their dogs, or just hang out. There‚Äôs also this homeless guy, I‚Äôll call him Tim, who‚Äôs been living near the park for a while. Tim‚Äôs actually a pretty nice guy. He doesn‚Äôt bother anyone, always picks up after himself, and even helps clean the park sometimes. He‚Äôs got a little spot with a bench and some blankets, and that‚Äôs where he stays. People in the community sometimes bring him food or coffee, and he never asks for anything.

Well, one day I was out walking my dog, and I saw this woman‚Äîclassic Karen vibes‚Äîmarching over to where Tim was sitting, minding his own business. She had one of those expensive yoga mats under her arm and a tiny dog on a leash. You could just tell she was looking for a reason to cause trouble.

She stops in front of Tim and starts berating him about how he shouldn‚Äôt be in ‚Äúher‚Äù park, that he was ruining the view, and how he needed to ‚Äúget a job‚Äù and ‚Äústop being lazy.‚Äù She was loud, rude, and drawing attention, but Tim just sat there, calmly explaining that he wasn‚Äôt hurting anyone and had every right to be in the park like anyone else. She, of course, wasn‚Äôt having it. She threatened to call the cops and have him removed for trespassing, even though it‚Äôs a public park.

A small crowd started forming because she was causing such a scene. A couple of us tried to step in, but she wasn‚Äôt listening to anyone. She eventually pulled out her phone and called the cops, making it sound like Tim was some kind of dangerous vagrant harassing her, which was a total lie.

Here‚Äôs where it gets good.

The cops arrive, and this woman puts on her best victim performance, saying how she feels ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù and ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù with Tim around. Tim stays totally calm and tells the cops exactly what happened, but it‚Äôs clear the woman expects them to side with her.

But the cops‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt. Turns out, one of the officers knew Tim. The cop says, ‚ÄúOh, hey Tim! How‚Äôs it going?‚Äù They talk for a minute, and it‚Äôs clear this officer knows Tim isn‚Äôt some dangerous guy, just a homeless man down on his luck who‚Äôs never caused trouble.

The cop then turns to the woman and says, ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, this is a public park. Tim has every right to be here, just like you do.‚Äù

Her face completely changes. She starts sputtering, saying how it‚Äôs unacceptable that ‚Äúpeople like him‚Äù are allowed in places like this. She keeps pushing, asking if the officer can ‚Äúdo something‚Äù to remove him. The cop‚Äôs response?

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, if you keep causing a disturbance, you will be the one removed from the park.‚Äù

Boom. You could hear a pin drop. The crowd was loving it at this point. The woman huffed and puffed, grabbed her dog, and stomped away, clearly embarrassed that her entitled attitude had backfired.

After she left, some people in the park came over and gave Tim some food and drinks, just to show support. The cop hung out for a bit to make sure everything was okay and chatted with Tim like they were old friends.

It was such a satisfying moment, seeing this entitled woman get shut down and realizing that just because you‚Äôre loud and obnoxious doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre in the right. Tim‚Äôs still there at the park, and now it seems like people look out for him even more.

=====================================================================

# Preface

*The Color of His Eyes* is an old 5^(th) Edition *Call of Cthulhu* scenario from the *Secrets of San Francisco* location book. Like a lot of the scenarios in that book, I thought it had a very novel premise and somewhat screwy execution, which is exactly the kind of material that I *really* like reworking. This one in particular seemed like its introductory events would attract a *lot* of attention from pretty high-level government authorities *very* quickly, so I decided to go ahead and make it specifically a *Delta Green* game.

I decided to set it in and around Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland (instead of San Francisco) because I‚Äôm reasonably familiar with the area and it happens to include *just about every institution and location of significance to the scenario* within about three city blocks.

I‚Äôve Handled two abortive play-by-post runs of the scenario; one cut off very early due to plain old IRL scheduling issues; but I got the sense that actual flaws in the scenario itself were dragging the second downhill before it too ended (in an oddly symmetrical way, with one player losing his job and another getting hired, leaving neither with the time to devote to a game). Due to the longer-form narration that PBP naturally tends to, I‚Äôve included some of the larger descriptive sections that I put together in `quotes`. Additionally, I‚Äôve included what I think might be useful information on what both groups *did* in the first parts of the scenario, and questions or possible issues I am looking for help with, in **bold**. Hopefully as I continue to workshop this thing, the bold text will be replaced with more and more possible writeup that once could use to actually *run* the scenario, which will end up going on Google Docs somewhere.

Shorter section this time, covering four additional areas the Agents can explore. One was a disaster in actual play. Two others went pretty well, and I think their writeups are solid. The fourth, I think I am just not going to use:

# Area: Cuyahoga County Coroner‚Äôs Office

This building is located on the triangular junction of Cedar and Carnegie Avenues; Garrick‚Äôs past trail (and, consequently, the Primary Color‚Äôs radiation trail) goes right past it. Two Case security vehicles, a van panel van and a patrol car, are visible in the parking lot outside.

**TODO: This is where things went pear-shaped** ***very*** **quickly in the one play run that actually made it here- and not in a fun way, just an anticlimactic, silly, and weird way that I as Handler didn‚Äôt know quite how to recover from and which basically put the scenario into a death spiral.**

**So, the** ***idea*** **here was that Sleight and two of the Case security guards had taken Ted Baker‚Äôs body here, and were currently shut up in an autopsy room with the coroner, Martin Cleggman, trying to pressure him into signing off on a death certificate with the cause listed as lightning strike. The receptionist would initially be distrustful of other armed people in uniforms flashing badges just like the security guards did, but then break down:**

>**""I don't know."" She leans forward, rubbing her temples. ""They came running in here around seven-thirty, two security guys and a man in a suit. They brought that mail van up to the back, but wouldn't let the guy who handles deliveries back there. Cleggman told him to go home, then he's been shut up in the back with them ever since. I went back there to... well, I asked if they wanted coffee or something but I was really just curious and then one of them pointed a gun at me, and... I don't know. I don't know, something's going on, there's all those cops over at the Cleveland Clinic and the university and now** ***you're*** **here, and...""**

**The goal was to create a situation where the Agents would want to gain access to the autopsy room ASAP, ideally charging in with weapons drawn, and Sleight would then deny any wrongdoing on Case‚Äôs part, his word and the guards‚Äô against Coroner Cleggmann.**

**What** ***actually*** **happened was one Agent asked the receptionist to pull up the security cameras he expected to be located** ***inside*** **the autopsy room and accessible from her desk computer alongside, like, the cameras showing the front and rear** ***doors*****. Not only did it seem odd to me that the coroner‚Äôs office would bother, but I‚Äôd think this would outright not be** ***allowed*** **by rules relating to medical confidentiality and the treatment of dead bodies. After that, the same Agent phoned the supervisor of the security guards at the Glennan Building lockdown, where they had just been turned away, and asked ‚Äúif there's any reason why two of his guys would commandeer the coroner's office across the street, and point a gun at the receptionist‚Äù;he took the supervisor entirely at his word when the supervisor said ‚Äòno‚Äô.**

**They dawdled long enough in the lobby looking at security footage and calling Cleggman‚Äôs cell phone (they got voicemail) that I decided to make some loud noises in the ambulance bay to push them along- the two security guards trying to find the keys to the coroner‚Äôs van parked there, so that they could dispose of the incriminating body (I was thinking it might‚Äôve ended up in the Cuyahoga, with the van being left at a chop shop in East Cleveland) while Sleight stayed behind with Cleggman to try to disavow everything.**

**The same Agent who‚Äôd asked about the camera in the autopsy room actually snuck back through a storage area and witnessed the guards loading the very clearly Color-attacked body in a Case security uniform into the van, then turned around and went** ***back*** **to the reception area leaving the guards to it.**

**Eventually I had Cleggman, in the absence of the two guards, physically push his way past Sleight and exit the autopsy room for the lobby, with Sleight following along behind him. The Agents saw this on camera and held both at gunpoint, demanding answers:**

>**""I was** ***attempting*** **to deescalate the situation here at the coroner's office. Some of our security men seemed to take issue with Dr. Cleggman's handling of the case, and, after learning that they'd been let go in an unrelated matter, seem to have decided to take the situation into their own hands.""**

**Surprisingly, either the Agents took him at his word or made no mention of any suspicions in chat, and instead asked about how the body got there. Sleight repeated the lighting-strike story, and, again, they didn‚Äôt openly question it. At about that time, the security guards managed to get the van started and flee; only to be immediately intercepted by another Agent heading over to the coroner‚Äôs office in a Cleveland PD squad car with Detective DeLoitte. My plan was for the security guards to lawyer up once detained (an added bonus of DeLoitte being involved was that she‚Äôd insist on doing everything by-the-book and not just keeping the guards tied up in a basement somewhere), and for Case to then make a stink about jurisdiction or otherwise work to get them released.That Agent‚Äôs player was the first to need to leave, so I never got to actually run that happening.**

**The other Agents managed to** ***not*** **get Sleight acting obstructive and assholish by immediately agreeing to the paper thin cover he produced; he insisted on following them to the next area they wanted to visit, Preston‚Äôs office, because I didn‚Äôt know how else to keep him in the game.**

**I feel like I badly mismanaged this encounter, but cannot for the life of me figure out what else I could have** ***done*** **to react to these circumstances and try to keep the operation on the track I wanted.**

**Also, the map I‚Äôd made originally,** ***suuuuucked*****:**

If the Agents *had* gotten a good look at Baker‚Äôs body, they would have discovered his (demagnetized) Case photo ID, two rounds missing from his handgun, and an electrically-driven mechanical watch stopped at 10:30:44.

# Area: Preston‚Äôs Office

Garrick‚Äôs old office is still listed on the Case Astronomy Department‚Äôs website, although it is now simultaneously listed as belonging to Dr. John Preston. It is located in Sears Hall, which is essentially a grimier and less well-lit version of the Glennan Engineering Building. The same card-lock systems are present, although during business hours the front doors and Preston‚Äôs office door are kept unlocked for public access. Although many buildings on this part of campus have been fused into larger structures, there is no way to get directly from Glennan to Sears. Even the brief hike across the parking lot or quad is absolutely miserable in this snowy weather- imagine going across this to and from classes every single day! (Thirsty agents will also find not a single working soda machine anywhere in this line of buildings.)

    Interviewing Dr. Preston

Preston is present in his office from 8:30 to 5:00. His schedule on Mondays is free, and he‚Äôll be happy to talk to Agents who drop by- especially if they had previously sent out a missing-persons‚Äô report for Robert Garrick. If Agents are making him uncomfortable, he will first claim he has a (fake) meeting and that he needs to cut this conversation short; if they persist, he‚Äôll flat-out tell them they need to leave and will call security. Since there‚Äôs a large group of security staff right nearby at the Glennan Building, officers will arrive within 2d3 combat rounds.

Preston can provide some additional context for Garrick‚Äôs mental state over the course of the Mousetrap program, and the deterioration in their working relationship:

>Preston closes his eyes and leans back in his chair. ""You know, it's funny. Before this whole project got started, we worked so well together... were friends, even. I went over to his house, introduced my... my girlfriend, at the time, to his wife. But the further he got into it, he just got stranger and stranger, started making demands, couldn't figure out why things weren't working, wanted to put more and more time into it. Mostly wanted *me* to put more and more time into it, actually, while he stayed here in his office and did calculations. I remember he tried to talk me into flying to Moscow the day after my wedding to pick up a paper from some archive... eventually we just hired someone off the Internet to go and take pictures with their phone. But... there was never any one *thing* that he could seem to figure out that'd make it work, he'd try explaining it to me and he'd go off on these tangents about torsion fields and bonkers interpretations of quantum physics, and then he'd get angry when I couldn't follow along. It was never just one thing.‚Äù

>""He explained it to me once, but... like a lot of what he was talking about at the time, I'm not sure if I could really make sense of it. This would've been some time in December or January, winter break so the campus was nearly empty, not long before the accident. He brought a case of beer up to the radio shack where I was working, and I think he was trying to give me some kind of hang-in-there speech, but it was all just about how... he compared the whole thing to finding, like, an exploit in a video game, an oversight in the code that'd let you skip out on taking damage or bounce off the level geometry and fling yourself to the end super-fast. That if we could just get it working properly we'd overturn whole areas of physics, and nothing else mattered anymore. The more he worked on it and the more obsessed he got, the more he'd come back to that, that the universe was bigger than we realized, that there were whole other avenues of science that had been... discredited or replaced by modelsthat were easier to understand, but that they were still useful.

>I just thought he was losing his mind... obsessive-compulsive types aren't exactly uncommon around here, but it's like he just fell down this rabbit hole one day, something funny-looking fell out of, I don't know, a computer model or some big data set and he just had to keep*picking*at it and trying to figure it*out*, and the more he picked at it the more he *had* to pick at it. You said you'd seen him up at the Clinic? Do you know if they ever figured out if that antenna was even the sole cause for his problems? Or if they'd ever found, like, a brain tumor or some kind of underlying condition like that? Because I've always wondered.""

He can also provide his own perspective on the circumstances of the accident:

>""Image objects in the outer solar system, I think. Maybe beyond, but I'd guess what we might've picked up was somewhere in the Kuiper belt. That's when our equipment started to show energy spikes, and Garrick had his... accident. I'd been up in that stupid radio shack all night, trying to debug it. We'd been getting those power spikes for... maybe two hours, after never having had them before. I'd emailed Dr. Garrick, and he came up to have a look for himself. He said he thought that something must've physically gotten caught in one of the waveguides somehow, like a bit of solder or even part of the housing itself had chipped off, so I powered it down and he took the waveguide off to have a look. There must've been... I dunno, residual power in one of the capacitors or something, because as soon as he got his head up to it, *bam*, he was on the floor, spasming.""

Preston will, of course, deny Lori Garrick‚Äôs accusations that he‚Äôd deliberately arranged the accident- truthfully. HUMINT rolls can detect that he feels guilty about *something*, but it‚Äôs just that he‚Äôd taken advantage of Robert Garrick‚Äôs absence to advance his career, and that he‚Äôs not 100% *sure* he didn‚Äôt accidentally screw something up with MOUSETRAP that made it malfunction the way it did.

Preston can also arrange for the Agents to *look* at the MOUSETRAP device down in storage, although not even he can authorize them to physically take it anywhere *else*- it‚Äôs University property (see the Storage Area subsection below):

* By default, getting access from Preston requires a successful social-skill roll.
* Due to his concerns about having been inadvertently responsible for Garrick‚Äôs accident, Agents who have given Preston any reason to believe they are suspicious of him or otherwise have treated him with hostility will be categorically refused access- if severely pressed, Preston will go to Case Security at the earliest possible opportunity and say that shady individuals were trying to coerce him into accessing University property.
* Alternatively, if Agents bring up the issue of negligence but respond sympathetically to Preston‚Äôs concerns, and promise that he won‚Äôt be prosecuted even if evidence of misuse*is*found by examining the device, he will grant access automatically if asked.

&#8203;

    Lower-Level Storage Area

The first floor of Sears Hall can be accessed from the interior by stairs or elevator. It is half the width of the rest of the building with the upper floors overhanging it on the parking-lot side; this space is used for additional parking and storage, with a giant metal flood door providing access to the interior.

There are fisheye security cameras overlooking each corner of the building, guaranteeing that each point on the exterior is monitored by two different cameras at once, and another attached to the ceiling of the overhang area. There are electronic card-key locks on each door leading into the first floor (i.e. both staircases, the flood door in the parking lot, and directly in front of the elevator), and another on the storage room itself. Agents trying to access the building from the quad side after hours will find that the front door is also locked at this time. At the start of the scenario, John Preston and Robert Garrick‚Äôs keycards both open these locks, although if Case has reason to believe the MOUSETRAP device is in danger either card can be remotely de-activated.

**TODO: Maps- in particular, I‚Äôm wondering if I can grab and rework an actual fire evacuation map of this building. I know they are posted for the upper floors where students go, but not sure about the secured lower floor.**

Getting access to MOUSETRAP directly from Case is possible with a successful Bureaucracy roll, *only if* the Agents haven‚Äôt done anything so far to put themselves on the university‚Äôs radar. Even then, a security guard will follow the Agents into the storage area and be looking over their shoulders the whole time.

If the Agents *have* done something to engage Case‚Äôs ire, the only way they can legitimately access MOUSETRAP is with an emergency court order, which will be opposed by the University‚Äôs best lawyers (Law 80), require the Agents to produce some kind of clear non-supernatural justification for being allowed to access the device, and take 1d4 hours for a judge to review each attempt.

This is also the only above-board way to physically move MOUSETRAP out of storage, irrespective of whether Case has suspicions about the Agents or not.

    The MOUSETRAP Device

The physical MOUSETRAP system isn‚Äôt so much one machine as it is a collection of equipment boxes, breadboards, and mutilated desktop computers that fill a three-foot-by-three-foot-by one-and-a-half-foot crate and weigh, collectively, about five hundred pounds. Two portable hard drives taped to the inside lid of the box contain documentation, schematics, data logs, and source code. The ‚Äúbusiness end‚Äù of the device is a five-pronged antenna backed by a reflector dish, about a foot in diameter. A person can pick it up and carry it around, but it needs to be anchored to a vibration-free surface to function properly.

3d2 hours of study and a hard success on an Electronics, SIGINT, Computer Science, or Science (Physics) roll are required to make any sense of how the machine was supposed to work and how it is supposed to be set up. If the Agents are going off of copies of the files only and don‚Äôt have the physical mechanism to examine, this roll receives a penalty die; alternatively, if John Preston or Robert Garrick is present and able to explain their experiences with the device, the difficulty becomes regular:

>The idea is that the beam of electromagnetic energy it transmits has a second, lower or higher-frequency component with a velocity going back into the receiver: the grant proposal makes repeated use of this GIF-

https://i.redd.it/cov4mox9e1ud1.gif

>  
However, inside the waveguide, some kind of interference or superposition happens, and according to some very dodgy interpretations of quantum mechanics (that's the Sagitov part), the negative component doesn't just have a direction pointing from the object the telescope was pointed at, but *acts as though it were actually emitted from that object* and carries information about its surface and properties.

Anyone who actually successfully understands MOUSETRAP gains 1 point of Unnatural knowledge and loses 1 point of Sanity.

The documentation also contains an email log handout explaining the events of Garrick‚Äôs accident, if the Agents were for whatever reason unable to get it from Preston:

https://preview.redd.it/slrqk5fge1ud1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=77875ff3a6bd43a7e248a4ab22662c61a1511adf

Even properly assembled and configured, MOUSETRAP needs several additional racks worth of high-powered modulator equipment to actually transmit its signals- this is what Garrick had taken over W8EDU‚Äôs radio shack to access.

The padded crate MOUSETRAP is stored in provides 10 armor points. Any damage taken by the innards renders the device inoperative until it is repaired. This can only be attempted by one or more people who understand the device‚Äôs operation, and have access to electronic parts (which can be found in other labs at Case, or from hobby stores). Let each person working on repairs make an Electronics, SIGINT, Computer Science, or Science (Physics) roll. Subtract *the amount by which the roll succeeded* from the damage the device sustained.

# Area: Garrick's House

An unassuming suburban residence, currently occupied by Dr. Garrick‚Äôs wife Lori.Until he has no other choice and/or is able to explain the situation to Lori, Garrick will avoid coming here. He knows that where he goes, the Primary Color will inevitably follow, and doesn‚Äôt want it coming anywhere near his wife.

Before Garrick steals the MOUSETRAP device; Agents looking into the garage (either through the windows in the garage door visible from the front, or asking to see it inside the house, or breaking in) will see a silver Toyota Camry (Lori‚Äôs) and a brown dust-cover concealing a white Ford Ranger pickup truck (Robert‚Äôs); and the snow on the driveway will be undisturbed. After the raid on Sears Hall, there will be fresh tire tracks and the dust cover will have been removed from the pickup.

If the Agents come calling before the raid, Lori will be distraught but polite, and invite them inside to talk about her missing husband, offering coffee in a living room that -aside from a truly gargantuan flat-panel TV- doesn‚Äôt appear to have been touched since the Reagan administration.

Lori can confirm that Garrick was under a lot of pressure to produce results on his latest research project before his accident, and that he seemed not so much unwilling as unable to properly explain what he was actually working on. Lori is herself an electrical engineer specializing in radio communication systems, but she‚Äôd always lose the thread when Roger dived into bizarre interpretations of fundamental quantum phenomena. He would often come home at two or three AM, and then be gone back to work when she woke up again next morning.

Before he started work on MOUSETRAP, Lori‚Äôs life with Roger had been utterly normal. She‚Äôs supported him throughout his year-long hospitalization, and is devastated to hear that he‚Äôd gone missing just as he seemed to be starting to get better. She has nothing but praise for Dr. Van Hyne and the Cleveland Clinic.

Lori will also seek the first possible opportunity to bring up to anyone in or near law enforcement, her pet theory that Dr. John Preston had some kind of deliberate hand in Robert‚Äôs accident. As the MOUSTRAP project wound on, every single one of Garrick‚Äôs graduate students quit and moved on to other things, except for Preston. Then, when the two of them were working alone at night, Garrick was knocked unconscious by a ‚Äúrandom‚Äù power spike in the device? Right after Preston had been fiddling with it unsupervised? And then Preston graduates and moves right into Garrick‚Äôs vacant position in the Astronomy Department? Lori‚Äôs absolutely furious that she‚Äôs the only one who seems to be able to connect the dots!

Lori still has Robert‚Äôs old Case ID card in a drawer in her home office with all her other papers, and it is still in the university system. Clever Agents might play to her suspicions about the MOUSETRAP device being sabotaged, to get her to hand the keycard over so they can investigate the device in Sears Hall (which also forces Dr. and Mrs. Garrick to make a more spectacular entrance when it‚Äôs time to take MOUSETRAP for themselves). Of course, if he realizes the Agents are interested in the Garrick family, Alexander Sleight might do the same thing and get hold of the card for himself. Even if he can‚Äôt physically take it (such as if the Agents already did- *especially* if the Agents already did), he can have it invalidated in the security system with a single phone call.

Eventually, Garrick *does* come home, where he and Lori (and possibly Dr. Preston, if he‚Äôs been recruited) work to steal the MOUSETRAP device from Sears Hall. If the Agents visit while Garrick is present, either just before the heist or after, Lori will try to hold an entire conversation with them while standing in the doorway. If the Agents try to force their way inside, she has an ancient Remington shotgun loaded and sitting on the foyer table just out of sight!

I would happily get whatever they are looking for if asked. One instance, I had been up & around the house & seen, i.e. they knew it so can't use that as an excuse, & when I went out after a few hours for 4-5 hours my room was ""vandalized"". As I said above, I would've gotten what they wanted & given it to them. This just makes me feel they are snooping. Looking to see what I've got in the room. 

I feel violated each time I've come home only to discover my room has been gone into while I was away. Am I not allowed some semblance of privacy? I only have so much space for my things which makes storage VERY difficult. Sometimes things can't always be stored properly. I don't want to my things rummaged through or pushed, pulled at so they can gain access while in the process dislodging something of mine they don't require, need access to. We're all adults. Can't mistake any of us for anything but. As such, I possess things I don't want other people to see...unless I want it seen.

Dad and I split 10 years ago. Son has always been a bit quirky and likely on the spectrum.  Mental illness began to emerge about 3 years ago and culminated into bipolar symptoms with delusions about a year and a half ago.  His dad moved his GF and her kids in 3 years ago before things were obvious.  He‚Äôs had 4 hospital stays in the last year, gets on meds, does great for a week and stops taking them.  Dad put down a boundary- to stay at home, you must take your meds.  Son left and spent the better part of the last two months on the street - sleeping under a bridge.  He held his job until 3 weeks ago.  Things went downhill fast for him.  He landed on my doorstep defeated.  His dad got him a room and we met the next day.  We had a plan to help him apply for a housing program he qualifies for.  While we waited for the appointment dad put him in an Airbnb.  The day of the appointment he bolted on me when it was time to leave.  The next few days got bad with delusions and threats of self harm.  I filed for an emergency admissions and he was picked up and evaluated.  They‚Äôd have kept him and he would have had a 10 day stay but he decided to volunteer to stay which changed the whole game.  He was able to sign himself out the next day.  He called his dad that night saying he knows he won‚Äôt have a warm place for the winter if he doesn‚Äôt take meds and that he was willing to go on them to stay off the streets.  Dad agreed to put him in a hotel until they could talk. 

Dad came yesterday and told him he needed to see he was serious before bringing him home.  Stay on meds and go to next weeks two appointments.  Son seemed eager to comply.  That brings me to today.  Dad spoke with his girlfriend who flat out said she cannot handle son being back there and told dad - him or me.  Dad sounds very sad - he understands she‚Äôs witnessed the manic screaming meltdowns and is afraid to see that again. But on the other hand dad can‚Äôt afford to keep putting him in hotels.  

My living situation will not allow for me to take him.  His sister may take him in as she feels dad‚Äôs girlfriend has always wanted him gone since she moved in.  He had already asked the other two kids that lived there to find places to go before he moved her and her kids in.  The kids all feel this is an affront to their brother because the boundary was - Medicate and you can stay.  Now it‚Äôs looking like he won‚Äôt be able to and my ex - is afraid to be alone.  I feel even though he doesn‚Äôt feel right about it, he will comply with the girlfriend.  

I guess I‚Äôm open to suggestions and viewpoints.  I try not to judge his relationship- it‚Äôs not my business.  But it‚Äôs affecting all 5 of our kids.  They see him as choosing her and her children over his own.  It‚Äôs a bad situation emotionally for them.  My heart hurts.  I do what I can and spend most mornings with my son for coffee and I feed him.  He‚Äôs able to eat by the way - dad foots the bill for that too (dad is fairly well off - I‚Äôm not).

1g0ziyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1g0ziyi/alert_for_a_long_text_dont_read_if_it_bothers_you/,"Alert for a long text! Don't read if it bothers you, of course.(My therapist asked me to tell the story I used the same text) I have several doubts about my ex-boyfriend's manners. By demanding responsibilities from him, could I have triggered narcissistic behaviour? ","My boyfriend (he is on autistic spectrum, maybe this information can be relevant here) seemed an introvert when I met him so I took the initiative of contacting also kissing on our first date, after a few weeks talking, which he later told me he took as a red flag; he told me that for him, things worked by going out for *""a coffee, then another coffee, and another coffee, and then...""*  He didn't finish the sentence, but it made me thoughtful because he had told me that in our previous conversation he had only been with only one person before me, (in terms of kissing or having sex) according to him. But that day we repeated many times and after we left each other to go home, we kept talking and he told me it was nice and enjoyable;
On our second date, he said he already felt like he was in a relationship. Caveat: We were both equally open to it. The enthusiasm in the conversations was mutual, as it was for the schedules initially. But soon after, some arguments arose when I started to question him after observing some behaviours such as omissions, inconsistencies and a few lies. I think the justification for that may go beyond insecurity. Eg.: telling me he needed to go out to buy something when he was actually going out for a coffee with a friend.  At first, that was somewhat understandable, but as time goes on, it's natural we get more confident and leave the excuses. But it wasn't what happened in so many cases.
So I observed behaviours like that and would point them out to him with the intention of helping him understand that he could be transparent with me about what he wanted/needed, and that I would understand him.
And I kept realising that, and trying to do the same, so I was getting frustrated but I was trying to show him the best way would be to communicate better, and I asked for that several times. We just started having arguments. 
Then he would stop responding to my messages or would reply with gaps of several hours, which was not usual, however I assumed it was a little because of his autism (I mean the fact he chose to be quiet and refusing any type of communication, I got it as a difficulty to face the conflicts in order to solve them as I read). On the other hand, it seemed like an attempt at emotional manipulation. I started feeling like he was trying to manipulate me over time with silent treatments, in order to condition me to accept that kind of behavior. He said he distanced himself because I was being accusatory, but he refused to have any clarifying things properly, giving  short and evasive answers only, followed by silence and later saying he didn‚Äôt want to talk about that matter. Eventually, he refused to discuss anything related to us, claiming that I only talked about that, but that's not true, because we connected in the first place with common interests. I was insisting on clarification because it was bothering me, obviously.

I wrote to him several times in an attempt to resolve that because he refused to call or talk personally claiming to feel uncomfortable. 
He started saying I was just  interested in emotional drama and that I was being abusive, which sounds like gaslighting to me.
In order to break that loop, I invited him to reflect and ask himself why things were happening that way. And after some other unpleasant events, I suggested we go to therapy with the same professional. At one point, he briefly said he would think about it, but later replied that he didn‚Äôt want to.

Let's go back in time for a while: Knowing he had previously used dating apps, one day I asked if he still used them. Not only did he tell me he wasn't using that, but he also made a gesture of handing me his phone as proof that there was nothing there. That alerted me because it doesn't take much intelligence to know that doesn‚Äôt serve as proof. A few days later, I asked again, and then he told me that after one of our early arguments, he stopped believing our relationship would work and simply went back to using dating apps. So yes! He had underestimated my intelligence by handing me the phone then. 

Similar things happened regarding conversations with ""other people,"" and what seemed to me like simple things that could be resolved through dialogue became triggers for avoidance. He told me that when ""I started being like that,"" his mind started to go in other directions. I also heard something like ""I did things that must have discouraged you, and you didn‚Äôt leave."" Would that be an implicit hint? Why didn't he tell me what he wanted then? What do my readers understand as ""other directions""? HOWEVER...  I asked a few times if he wanted to continue meeting/getting involved with other  people because he conveyed this in previous conversations about people 
he was talking to when we met and his answer was: ""Sigh"", ""I'm not doing this conversation anymore, let's talk about music"", or simply nothing. So he never gave me the confidence that he had stopped talking to ppl who he used to flirt with. He even said he was still having some conversations with one of them  at some point (by the way, the one he had shown attraction for, and according to him, it wouldn‚Äôt work out because he had a ‚Äúsexual hobby‚Äù that didn‚Äôt work for him, but he continued talking to her because he wanted to understand what she wanted from him. That was also during our relationship) I naturally asked questions about his feelings/ intentions towards that person (She lives at the same country he was going to live for a couple of months for some specific reason, well.... It's natural since he told me he started talking to them during the days we were in bad vibes. So he said I was jealous and he simply adopted an: ""I'm not talking to anyone,"" as a standard response for anything that referred to a similar subject.

*Just one more topic about ""I'm not talking to anyone"" Once, during one of our conversations when he was in a good mood, he mentioned that he basically only talked to family members and three friends, and months before he had said he had two or three female friends who lived in the UK / Corea and it was very rare for him to talk to them. I felt that his tone was defensive, which conveyed more insecurities. I don‚Äôt want to sound like a judgmental fool, but I will point out a few things and leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions. The person had 'theoretically' stopped using dating apps after having used them for several years. He considers himself a nerd, and much of his life is online, with several social media accounts. It‚Äôs a bit strange to say he limits himself so much in chats. I asked a few questions trying not to sound invasive, but that‚Äôs the response I got. And then: I saw a few conversations, when he opened his Instagram one of them with a girl (from USA) btw and reactions with ""‚ô•Ô∏è"" although the subjects at least at that moment, the topics were generic. Discouraged, I just said in a sarcastic tune: *""Anyone is too little!""* He called me jealous, claiming they were just friends.. Actually the conversations were about general stuff. I don't believe that girl would even be interested in him in a romantic way (for reasons that I won't elaborate on further) but the conversation seemed very ""enthusiastic"". Before ppl ask me how I could see that and call me invasive.... I asked him for that and he showed me. 
And he told me: she‚Äôs my friend. (Wtf?) Further down, there were 3 or 4 more chats with girls, and I asked about the one closest to the bottom (he had done the same thing with me before when he saw my chat open, and I responded without any issues. The difference is that I never said I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone; on the contrary, I even mentioned a male friendship I made through a dating app in the past).

At the bottom was a conversation with one of his former students. Hey, it‚Äôs fine to have friendships with the opposite sex, but when you start hiding it... Bro? Why the insecurity at this level? Could they have been the targets of some previous flirting? (Maybe not just 'previous' ü§î)""
But my point wasn‚Äôt about the people or the conversations with them because of jealousy simply. Actually it was more related to the fact that he was always on the defensive, giving evasive answers and inconsistent justifications in various aspects of our conversations about topics like that. He used to say he basically was talking to five other people. 

I just asked him things like that because of the other manners, I already started to think that he was maintaining the relationship with me because it was 'real' at the moment, but he wanted to keep the possibility of something better or simply 'something' in case things didn‚Äôt work out between us. The traditional game of those who embrace the idea of fluid relationships. 
Could this behavior be partly related to the difficulty of resolving conflicts? That's it: instead of having a conversation with me about what was bothering him and what was bothering me, he simply tried to sweep it under the rug and avoid me. I struggled to believe that someone I admired precisely for showing me that they were above various types of behavioral neglect was choosing that path.
 I was kind of waiting for the person to face the reality because some behaviours seemed childish and therefore incompatible with the part of his personality that made me get interested. He used to present good arguments and articulated consistently on the general topics we discussed, which made our connection enjoyable initially.
 We enjoyed a good moment together of course.
Things heated up between us, like with any couple. The difference was that, by his choice, we didn‚Äôt have privacy, and he only agreed to go out in public places. That was okay for me, but after a few months, I suggested doing something different, like going camping or going somewhere that would allow us more privacy. This wasn‚Äôt necessarily for having sex, but we always went to pubs, for a walk in town, or to parks, which, although still public places, allowed us a few minutes of 'peace.'

We  had sex only once, for literally 3 seconds, and it caused him extreme concern about the condition of the condom (which was intact and fine) and a huge paranoia about all the negative possibilities.
We did that in a place without total privacy, and he was so worried while I was trying to calm down he disclaimed about the spot - a park -  but that was the only option we could think about. (üìå On that day, we had gone to that place somewhat prepared for it, and he even made some funny comments about it. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I was okay about it.)

After that, he told me he wouldn't be prepared to do that again anytime soon, I said ok but I didn't understand such a big block around it since he told me I used to make him uncontrollably horny and sex would be something dangerous. 
Days later he said something like ""I want you"", ""let's do whatever you want"", "" let's have sex"". He had a few beers that day and the next day he sounded like his changed his mind a little and in some time later he sent me a 15-min You-Tube video containing some basic principles of Geomancy. He told me he had asked some questions during that practice about whether he should have sex with me or not. He was looking for answers regarding a decision about a trip he was going to take related to professional matters.

I was willing to have patience with almost everything that would be different for me, but no cheating. I basically found myself wrestling with someone else's partially fictional universe.

He said emphatically: ""You ruined everything"" was his sentence when he saw me struggling against an end in that condition, bc letting a lack of communication create a society of monsters to destroy expectations and good feelings becomes sad, poor, even ridiculous. That's my ""doubt"" (if I really can call it doubt) because that represents a weak manipulation tactic usually used by neurotypicals lacking emotional intelligence or / and respect, but technically that doesn‚Äôt match him because he usually analyzes facts and situations more intelligently, in a high level common sense, I would say. At the same time I‚Äôm talking about a person who *literally* ran away a few times when I sought him out to have a conversation. 

Later, he started engaging in apparent narcissistic games, like singing while I was talking to him (I understand he was anxious about making a difficult decision for him in those days, but‚Ä¶) He complained that I only wanted to talk about relationship issues while he preferred to talk about movies or music, which sounded a bit bizarre to me; I wasn‚Äôt talking about problems because I enjoyed it but because I found it necessary to  clarify what was bothering me. And he seemed to start hating me and for a while I felt the same.

There were times when I went to see him (without us schedule it and I know that's not the best thing to do but he just stopped talking once again, I was sad, because I know there's a lot of better ways to solve that. I just wanted to have a decent conversation. Although I understood he got nervous and anxious with our issues.
One day I approached him saying, ""Hi, I'd like to talk.

 I know you're uncomfortable, but can we at least have a brief conversation?"" He seemed to hate me at that moment, but I insisted, telling him how disproportionate it was imo. He certainly interpreted many things from my side in a way that I didn't intend. He even said a few times he was paranoid; 
Naturally, people ask why I stayed. I wish I could have done something to change that *because/however/although* I can't see a logical reason for that set of strange manners. I got irritated in the process, and I made mistakes in how I treated him too, but nothing unforgivable to the point where I didn‚Äôt get any response, even if neutral.
So he told me that if I didn't leave, he would notify the police. I laughed ironically, but in a state of perplexity. Really? Something we could clear up over coffee, talking like the 30+ year-old adults we are. He started laughing in a strange way‚Äînervous, sarcastic‚Äîand turned the corner. I asked where he was going, and he answered, ""To the police station."" I said, ""Really? I‚Äôll go with you, and we can clarify the exact reasons driving you to do this, right?""
I couldn‚Äôt understand what led him to this extreme but wouldn‚Äôt allow him to have a conversation with me as the situation required. There were no screams, no violence, no offense or anything that would make the involvement of a police officer necessary imo. 

He claimed that I was ""following"" him. It was: I went to meet him on the same path we used to take when he was coming back from work. It was our way to the train station. We had an arrangement, and apparently, he wasn‚Äôt keeping it. I believe I had the right to understand what was going on. Simply blaming me, saying I was ruining the relationship, was neither fair nor sensible. I had some indications that he was seeing other women.
I never made any comment that would make him think it was a criterion for me that a man should only have had one woman /s or that he couldn't go out with a friend, or that someone couldn't have had a past or other loves. 

He also told me he felt threatened by the tone I used when I let him know I found out where he lives. üìåThere we go: : we don‚Äôt live far from each other, there‚Äôs just one neighborhood separating ours, and a friend recognized him because he had seen us together and asked if I knew, and I responded that I only knew the general area. My friend was even a bit surprised because most people in relationships usually visit each other‚Äôs homes. But in our case, he would feel awkward about his parents and there are other implicit factors, like him having thought I might have some material interest, a different nationality, given that he also made it clear he held some prejudice toward people of my nationality (yeah... I know). This would be another barrier for certain things. I know that the way he processes some thoughts is very different from mine, and I let a lot of things slide because I believed time would help him feel more at ease with me. But his behavior went from 100 to 0 in some aspects towards me. The conversations got a strange tune, he started frequently giving up on our schedule; apparently, the inconsistencies about trivial day-to-day things were increasing in proportion.
There was a moment when we reconciled, and we exchanged an ""I love you,"" which once again came from me, but he reciprocated. Also, one day, when I suggested I might leave the country, he said he felt wrecked, empty... 
My understanding of that guy's motives fluctuates as much as his emotions and feelings, I think. In part, he was afraid of being left, so he preferred to do it first, as he did but in the process, he decided to inflate his ego by showing narcissistic traits. Did he use the fact that I chose to stay and try to fix things as a means to inflate his ego, seeing the opportunity to cheat?
He justifies the feelings I had for him by saying that this was the result of magic spells he did before we met. 
I've already put myself in his shoes several times, but I don‚Äôt know if he has the same ability. 
I was disappointed and perplexed by his reaction to my attempt to talk + he had said that his friends advised him to stay away from me. Did his account contain valid justifications for my dissatisfaction? I don't think so
So I wrote a text similar to this one for his friend, slightly shorter than this, telling what would be 'my version' of the events. And probably now he hates me because of that. 
Any comments on the subject are welcome, except about the length of the text, as I'm aware that it‚Äôs worthy of a magazine article, lol

‚¨áÔ∏èPhrases he told me more than once that, in my opinion, convey superficiality/immaturity and don't align with his manners:
1. ""You are attractive, who would leave you?""
2. ""You are attractive, no one would cheat on you.""
3. ""I never cheated.""

1g0zh7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1g0zh7v/breville_bambino_temperature_stability_breville/,Breville Bambino Temperature Stability (Breville Buyers Be Aware),"There are lots of conflicting reports on the internet about the Breville Bambino. Some say it runs too cold, many reference a Lance Hedrick video and say it easily gets too hot, and everyone else says it is the obvious choice for any beginner setup. Who is right? After lots of testing and considerations for the engineering choices of the machine, I believe everyone is correct and I will explain why. I invite this to be a discussion more than a declaration of fact. This is simply my opinion as someone with a mechanical engineering degree and about a year of home espresso experience on the Breville Bambino.

First is understanding how the Breville Bambino works. I will be referring to Tech Dregs‚Äô fantastic teardown that I have linked below and the Breville owner‚Äôs manual. The bambino and many other Breville machines use a ‚ÄúThermoJet‚Äù heating system to heat a small volume of water between two metal plates ‚Äúin 3 seconds‚Äù. On the outlet of this flat, spiral shaped, continuous heater is a thermocouple/thermistor (I believe it is likely a thermocouple, but the teardown calls it a thermistor. It's not really relevant to this discussion). The important thing to note here is that this sensor measures the temperature of the water leaving the HEATING ELEMENT.¬† Once it goes past the temperature sensor it runs through plastic tubing to a solenoid-controlled valve (more plastic) that directs the water to either the steam wand or the group head. Not once does the machine measure the temperature at the group head. This temperature sensor then informs a PID controller which controls the heat released by the heater. The PID is NOT attached to a boiler. This allows for near instant ready time but means there is not a large thermal mass of water or metal keeping the heating element and water within it at a constant temperature. The only thing providing any kind of temperature stability is the PID controller. This is the PIDs only job: temperature stability in the heating element. As I have mentioned, it is only concerned with the current temperature at the heater outlet, which is before even the solenoid. This allows the heater to provide a constant stream of water at a constant temperature.

Test #1) does the PID work and will the Breville Bambino provide water at a constant temperature?

Yes, quite well actually. This can be tested by using the steam wand to produce boiling water. After about 10 seconds the water made its way out of the steam wand and the temperature stabilized at about 95C +/- 0.2 C and continued at that temperature for the remainder of the minute before the machine filled my mug and timed-out. This means that the water took a few seconds to make it through all of the internal hoses and to heat all of its pathway to 95C. Once at steady-state, the machine was able to maintain its planned temperature. 95C is higher than the advertised 93C, but I am not a Breville engineer and maybe they put in a slightly higher set point for the steam wand. Regardless, the PID works, and the Bambino is able to produce constant temperature water.

Test #2) Is my puck getting the promised 93C consistently? A much more complicated question. In short, not really, but to fully answer this we need to understand a few things.

First, Breville (and everyone else) recommends running an empty shot first. The results of the last test demonstrate this is a REQUIREMENT. Ignoring the fact that the tubes and group head are cold, you need to get warm water to shower screen of the group head, or the first few seconds of your shot will be just like the first few seconds of the previous test (no water or cold leftover water). This also means anyone here on reddit suggesting that you should run the steam wand first to get the heater ‚Äúwarmed up‚Äù then pull your shot is ignoring this priming effect and how the heater works. The heater does not need to ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù, the group head and portafilter do. By design the heater gets to temperature near instantly.

Second, most if not all of the prosumer machines have a way to pre-heat the group head and keep it hot. Whether that‚Äôs with a thermosiphon in the e61 group head or a PID in something like the Bezzera BZ10. These machines are able to do this because they have large amounts of metal in the group head that can act like a giant thermal battery and buffer. That thermal battery takes time to charge. So, if your expensive machine uses a boiler, you are waiting the 20ish minutes for the water to come to temp, but you‚Äôre also waiting for the group head. This thermal mass at the group head allows for the temperature stability of these machines. Breville designed the Bambino and Bambino plus to be affordable, so they did not include all of the expensive metal or the heating elements at the group head. The bambino depends on the heat of the water destined for your coffee to warm the group head. Now take a look at the teardown video. You‚Äôll notice that the bambino is basically all plastic after the heater until the group head. Tech Dregs discusses this at the end of his video too, but this all-plastic design is a feature. It was done on purpose.¬† Not only to make the machine more affordable, but it allows the Bambino to achieve the advertised 3 second warm up time. You cannot have 3 second ready time and the thermal stability at the group head of a prosumer machine. Adding all of that metal would mean a 10-20 minute warm up period (hence why a $4000 machine cannot get around the warming period and give you 3 second ready time). A machine can have temperature stability but temp stability at the heater and at the group head are NOT the same thing. Many people are spending thousands to get around this.

So, with the Breville, what can we do to get temp stability, not just at the heater, but at the group head? Pull an empty shot to heat it up like Breville says. They designed the machine to work this way, that‚Äôs why they suggest it. If you want to get that tiny piece of metal in the group head as hot as possible follow the advice of u/rmanalan (their post linked below). They recommend using the double walled pressurized basket for the empty shot. Run the empty shot using manual mode and do not cancel the shot. This will allow the machine to run for 1 minute. Repeating their tests on my own I can confirm their results, after a minute it gets very hot. (Note when they test with the steam wand that is for heating water in a mug from cold and not measuring the output of the steam wand like I did in Test #1).

But what does my testing say? First the parameters, I am placing the thermocouple inside of the stock portafilter but outside of the basket. Without a pressurized basket, my machine produces water from the group head at about 65-70C very consistently (both with the portafilter and without it just holding the thermocouple to the water and sacrificing my hands). I believe Breville knows the machine is doing a casual warm and rinse. It does not need to waste energy on going to 93C because there‚Äôs no coffee to brew. With a pressurized basket, it is a very different story. Running u/rmanalan‚Äô s minute test I get a range of temperatures. At the beginning of the shot I am still on the cold side starting at 70C (running the test starting with a cold machine), but by the end of the minute I agree with Lance Hedrick, I am over 93C in the 95C+ area. This means everyone on reddit feeling like the bambino is cold and under extracting their shots is right, but so is everyone that says the bambino gets too hot. The water in the portafilter starts out too cold and gets too hot. If you are pulling very long shots, then you will start to over-extract at the end. This means if you pull a shot without priming the system at all then you are in trouble. At the beginning of the shot when you‚Äôre expecting to get the sour part of the espresso, the temperature will be extra low, extra under-extracted, and extra sour. By the late end (if you are pulling a 50 second shot) then you are too hot and over extracting the part of the shot that is already prone to be bitter. This is the worst of both worlds. But what happens in the middle? In the middle the bambino is able to hold a temperature in the mid to low 80C range at the outside of the basket. Pre-heating the group head and then immediately pulling your shot allows this 80s range from the beginning and to be held throughout the \~30 second range where most wisdom says to pull your shot. So yes, Lance is technically right, but functionally you are running colder than expected and the bambino is not a machine that runs hot (particularly for the 1-2 shots the machine is designed to pull before it is turned off). Before you run to the comments about my testing method, I will concede that I did not test the temperature inside the basket or with a puck in. This is going to affect the results, so do not take my results to mean that you are brewing in the low 80s. I am here to understand how the machine works and analyze the trends so we can better understand how to use it, not measure the exact brew temp. I‚Äôll leave that to someone else. I expect the machine, in actual use while I am not measuring, is operating in the high 80s. An area that has the potential to make acceptable dark roasts.

My theory for why this is all happening: I‚Äôve alluded to it, but I believe the answer is thermal mass. There is a reason that Breville uses nearly all plastic internals, provides a lightweight aluminum portafilter, and recommends an empty shot. It all has low thermal mass, and the empty shot will quickly \~warm\~ everything. The plastic tubing and half plastic portafilter will no longer be cold and a beginner can quickly pull a half decent shot through it. Breville is banking on the fact that nothing will be in contact with the water for long, so if they are fast enough then the constant temp water leaving the heating element will result in an extraction where the temperature is stable throughout. (in the high 80s/low 90s). This is PERFECT for the average joe who just wants to stop drinking Keurig coffee. He‚Äôs already drowning out any minor variance in taste with milk and/or sugar, only pulling one or two shots, not buying any extra equipment, and doesn‚Äôt know what r/espresso is. He doesn‚Äôt need anything more than this $300 machine can do and it does exactly what he wants for a great price that doesn‚Äôt gatekeep espresso. That is who Breville engineered this machine for. Unfortunately for me, I have the taste and perfectionist behavior that craves a $4000 machine, but my wallet disagrees, so as a beginner I bought one too. So, what is happening to me and everyone else upset with the Bambino online? I bought a stainless steel bottomless portafilter (larger thermal mass), a WDT tool, an IMS basket, and started drinking my espresso without any milk. Now I am in a tough spot where I feel unhappy with the machine because I am trying to act like buying fancy accessories changes the way my machine is designed to brew. It is not a high-end machine. So, I will be brewing with dark roasts and using the machine for what it was designed for until I have the savings to invest more.

For a more technical theory about the temperature curve please indulge me a little longer. The thermal mass of the group head is nearly all concentrated in the portafilter. There is very little metal in the actual group head of the machine. This means that if you want the best temperature stability in the group head while using a Breville ‚ÄúThermoJet‚Äù machine, you need to warm both the shower screen and the portafilter. If you want to do a complicated maneuver with a minute, a pressurized basket, and 10-12oz of expended water every time then be my guest. It will get the group head as hot as possible. The issue is that while you are changing the basket and preparing your puck, the tiny piece of metal (shower screen) in the machine is cooling down FAST. Also, all of that heat energy that you just put into the pressurized basket is now sitting on your counter. All of the heat energy you put into the portafilter also just flooded into the new basket (through thermal conduction. It‚Äôs metal on metal) and now both are a little warm but mostly cold. With the Breville machines, your only friend is speed. Speed getting to temp, speed warming the portafilter, speed in your puck prep, and speed in pulling the shot. That said, and as I‚Äôve mentioned before, an empty shot is STILL needed. Don‚Äôt let the system hold stale water from yesterday and don‚Äôt needlessly let anything be room temperature. Any warming that can be done before you pull your shot is heat that is not coming out of your brew water during the shot and is letting your extraction happen closer to the planned 93C that is coming from the heating element. Now that you‚Äôve warmed everything to the best this machine can, let‚Äôs follow what happens. The water gets to 93C in the heating element, gets pumped out, and hits your group head, coffee, and portafilter. All 3 act like a heat sponge, and they pull heat from the water lowering its temperature (but hopefully not too much because you pulled the empty shot). As the shot goes on, this continues and the heating element and PID do not care. They are sending constant temperature (93C) water out (constant heat). Think of the water as a constant allocation of energy per second from the heater to the group head. Once the water (and energy) gets to the group head, the water gives energy away into the colder elements (group head, coffee, portafilter), until they are at the same temperature. This means the water has been cooling down on its way from the heater to your cup and is no longer 93C. While that change has been happening over a distance, there has been another change happening over time in a single location. The water in the portafilter has been getting warmer. As the group head gets warmer the amount of energy that leaves the water every second to go to warming the group head decreases. This means more heat energy the water gets to keep and the higher its temperature. This is seen in the steady but slow climb in water temperature in everyone‚Äôs experiments (the climb is slowed by the thermal mass of the everything the water is warming). At approximately one minute though, everything is the same temperature. I confirmed this by using electrical tape to connect the wall of the basket to my thermocouple. This is where you wanted to start but unfortunately your espresso finished pulling 30 seconds ago. But once this happens the water in the group head is finally hot and 93C and there is thermal feedback to the PID. The water is no longer cooling down as it goes to your cup, it is staying constant until it leaves the portafilter. This means that the heater is producing too much heat, so the PID has to respond and stop heating the water so much or the temp will climb. Unfortunately, the PID cannot cool anything, just stop adding heat, so everything starts getting very warm at the end of the minute test. This is what Lance notices. ¬†Now the thermal mass of all of the water in the tubes and the group head are working against the machine to keep it overly hot. You have run the machine for too long. Breville did not design their machines for this!

At the end of the day, everyone is right. Breville designed this machine for beginners. Beginner habits will play well with it. If you try and use it like an enthusiast machine you will notice it runs a little cold and struggles with medium roasts and I can only imagine also light roasts. But if you are a coffee youtuber or someone like me then you will notice it gets overly hot when you run it continuously for longer than it was designed (no coincidence it auto-shuts off at 1 min!). Please enjoy this machine for what it is!

As a side note, I don‚Äôt own a Gaggia Classic Pro, but I imagine that it suffers from similar thermal mass issues regardless of if you PID mod it or Gagguino it. Compared to a stock Gaggia I think the Breville bambino is better especially at $300. With the PID, I think the GCP is VERY similar to the bambino because the PID is still only on the heating element. The thing to note with a PID GCP is that it only has a 100ml boiler so if you run 70ml preheating things then you only have 30ml to make your drink which is not enough. At least the bambino is ‚Äúbottomless‚Äù when it comes to producing hot water from the heater.

If you‚Äôre not tired of reading what I have to say, here‚Äôs my story of how I got here. I am new to making espresso and like many people on this subreddit I bought a Breville bambino as my first machine. For a long time, I was blaming my puck prep, my grinder (a fellow opus), and my portafilter. I could make shots that tasted okay, but I never made something that I was confident wasn‚Äôt sour. Pouring 8-10oz of steamed milk on top made a latte that was better than any drip coffee I‚Äôd ever made so I was happy. Unfortunately, I am on r/espresso and I have a girlfriend who lived in Italy for a year so sour espresso wasn‚Äôt acceptable for long. After a couple of weeks drinking sour shots that I had dialed in to the best of my ability, I decided to go to a local roaster and order a real double shot espresso. I noticed two things: first is the shot was delicious and I am not crazy for doubting my espresso and the second was that it was HOT. Suddenly I realized my shots were all sour because I was brewing too cold. I went down a reddit rabbit hole, ordered a set of thermocouples, and began testing.

¬†

TLDR: My opinion is that the bambino is a great beginner machine, especially for its price. Just use dark roasts, follow the instructions and run an empty shot immediately into your portafilter and basket before pulling your real shot, and don‚Äôt expect it to perform like a $2000+ PID machine with an e61 group head just because the letters PID are in the marketing material. If you do something different and love your bambino, keep doing it!",16,1728613108.0,espresso,8,0.87,False
1g0zgw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g0zgw5/my_dad_keeps_telling_me_i_should_marry_my_cousin/,My dad keeps telling me I should marry my cousin,"I‚Äôm not sure which forum to put this on. It‚Äôs so weird to me and I don‚Äôt know what to think.
 So I (36f) have a 3rd cousin a couple years older than me I‚Äôll call Michael, that my dad has said to me twice now I should marry. The first time I pretended like I didn‚Äôt hear what he said, and thought it was a slip of the tongue, because it was really weird and grossed me out. 

And then he brought it up to me again a few months later, stating that ‚Äúit‚Äôs legal to marry my 3rd cousin you know‚Äù and that ‚Äúhe always cared about me‚Äù. 
And I realized he was dead serious. Wtf. 

Yeah it may be ‚Äúlegal‚Äù but this guy is still my family and that is straight up super weird and creepy. We share the same last name and he grew up with me as a family member. Even if he wasn‚Äôt a blood relative, growing up as a family member 
‚Ä¶.that puts someone automatically on my nonromantic list.  we don‚Äôt see each other like that and I‚Äôm sure if my cousin heard my dad saying this he‚Äôd be weirded out as well.

My dad claims he ‚Äúalways cared about me‚Äù, so therefore I should marry him‚Ä¶.and I think my dad is going delusional. He‚Äôs almost 70 and used to play football so may have head trauma?

Why wouldn‚Äôt my cousin care about me? that doesn‚Äôt mean that he thinks of me in a romantic way. He‚Äôs just nice. He treats me like a cousin. 
I wonder if my dad is one of those guys that thinks every waitress that is nice to him is hitting on him? lol 

Anyways, I probably saw Michael only a handful of times over my childhood, usually once a summer at family reunions and we didn‚Äôt really talk or hang out much. He lived in another state and I only saw him when he came to visit in summers. he was always typically really nice and shy kid and his dad was always pushing him to hang out with me, but we never really did. 

When I was in my teens he got a boat and took me out wakeboarding and he was cool, but we never really had a relationship or talked outside of that. I don‚Äôt really have close relationships really with any of my extended family cousins outside of family reunions.. and besides that I‚Äôve maybe seen Michael a couple more times throughout the years like I went snowboarding with him and his sister once and then once in a while, I‚Äôll meet up with him for coffee and met with him and his fianc√© twice over the last 2 years because he was living in a town I was visiting.  Other than that, we don‚Äôt really talk and don‚Äôt really have anything in common. 

So I split up with my partner of three years two days ago and my mom called me  and said that she had talked on the phone with my dad (they are
13 years divorced). She told him about my split and instead of having any kind of sympathy for me or anything or an opinion on it, he just brought it to my mom that I should marry my cousin and that ‚ÄúMichael is the only guy that has ever cared about her‚Ä¶‚Äù.  She of course called me to asked what was wrong with my dad, because what a weird thing to suggest right?

I don‚Äôt know what to think about this. It kind of feels a little little offensive at this point like my dad is saying The best I can get is a family member?And he told my mom he‚Äôs only guy that‚Äôs ever cared about me and implying ever will‚Ä¶. Just because my cousin treats me like a normal human being? And the relationship I just got out of that person didn‚Äôt care about me? 

Oh and MICHAEL IS ENGAGED. 

He‚Äôs been in a very happy relationship for the last six years or so (maybe longer?) with a really amazing woman I have met twice now. I‚Äôve tried to explain this to my dad and he doesn‚Äôt seem to think that matters and keeps bringing it up.
I don‚Äôt know why my dad is so stuck on this. And doesn‚Äôt think that I can find a good partner on my own. 

I‚Äôve always had a really strange weird relationship with my dad because I just don‚Äôt feel like he has a lot of faith in me and doesn‚Äôt really love me that much. and doesn‚Äôt respect me when I tell him no about things. I told him the first time he brought this thing up with Michael that that was really weird and he‚Äôs engaged, and yet he‚Äôs still stuck on this. 

TLDR: my dad keeps insisting that I should marry my cousin, who is engaged, and I‚Äôm super weirded out",1,1728613079.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I've been doing this on and off again for a year. I am 5'9 176lbs with my clothes on (no shoes) in the morning, 40 years old male. My goal weight is 165-170lbs. I have never been obese. I've always excercised regularly in some form my whole life. Biggest I've ever been is 215lbs. Past few years, my weight has fluctuated between 180-200lbs. I have one kidney, lost one kidney to cancer 4 years ago.



I had several blood tests done while I was about 36 hours into a fast on Wednesday. I get them done 3 times a year, but I've never done it while fasting before. Everything was normal except my LDL which was almost double the normal range (186 mg/dl) my glucose was 82 mg/dl (normal 70-99) yet my A1C is at 5.7 which is boarderline prediabetes. Usually I am worried about my GFR which is kidney values, but I've never seen my LDL or A1C anywhere this high. Sometimes my cholesterol is elevated, but not high. My blood test also noted that my ketones were elevated.



So my question is, can one weekend of binging really affect you that much?? Last weekend I really treated myself since I haven't had any sweets in 2 months. I had a whole box of rice crispy snacks, ice cream with chocolate peanut butter, fairly sweet kombucha, like a whole tub of queso, a whole box of taquitos and chips, heavy cream and lots of agave syrup in my coffee with cinnamon. I can maybe see that elevated ketones could raise my blood sugar, but the high LDL cholesterol is really a head scratcher or maybe it isn't. I know I binged, but I felt like I earned it.
