I continued to drink my one cup of coffee a day thinking it did no harm and realised way later when I quit it for a week how it was actually impacting me!

Of course there could be a number of reasons as to why you could experience certain symptoms which applies to me too but as soon as I quit dairy and caffeine, continued my iron supplements I noticed a massive increase in energy. Apparently dairy and caffeine limit iron absorption. I was shocked to see my ferritin levels drop from 145 ug/L to 19ug/L in 5 months. I was blacking out from simple movements, out breath from putting my hair up in a pony tail etc. Now have more energy.

Don’t get me wrong I still feel tired and want naps but at least I can actually wake up on time for work in the morning and focus more. 

I’ve swapped my morning coffee with a homemade herbal and spice tea with raw honey ACV ginger turmeric lime and cloves. 

I also eat fruit first thing in the morning to help me cleanse my digestive tract and help me go to the toilet more (constipation who?) so far I’ve been going 3-5 times a day since implementing these changes!

Apparently coffee increases heartburn too which I did not know about! 

This is a note to any mother suffering, to look for small changes you can make to help ease symptoms. Get your blood work done and don’t just rely on your doctor or midwife for recommendations do external research and experiment with what works best for you.

1hfmhfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1hfmhfq/inlaws_kissed_baby_and_trashed_the_house_and_left/,In-laws kissed baby and trashed the house and left ,"My in-laws came to see our baby for the first time. They immediately kissed the baby on the cheek and were offended when I protested. My husband was in another room when this happened so I was left to speak up myself. They were pissed I told them not to kiss my baby and quickly handed him back to me giving me a disgusted look. 

There was about 10 people. They used up plenty of plates, cups, spoons that were left in the living room and filling up my sink. Chips bags and napkins were all over the coffee table. My husband and I more tired than ever running on no sleep had to clean up after they left instead of resting. Every time they come over for dinner they'd always help clean up but this time they left the mess because they thought I insulted them. 

We had no village show up for us when I gave birth. It's been one disappointment after another and we quickly learned no one was showing up to help. But at least don't show up to trash my house just to ""see"" the baby. I'm really sad because my mother isn't around and I haven't felt anyone show up with joy and want to celebrate with me the birth. It's just been so disappointing. 

I'm just venting because I've really been struggling since they came questioning myself because I know they'd never let go of the fact that I asked them not to kiss the baby. Culturally it's unheard of for someone to say this. To them it was a big insult. I asked nicely and apologized profusely that I was sorry I'm asking this but it's flu season and I want to protect the baby. 

Editing to add: these are not my husband's parents I'm referring to. They are sister and brother in law and distant relatives of my husband. 

It's also flu season and half his family is struggling with the flu. His sister showed up with her very sick toddler who had a bad cough and was coughin on everyone and everything. Her husband walked in after taking a smoke outside smelling heavy of cigarettes and filled up the living room with his smell. Overall it was an extremely disappointing gathering and I made the choice to protect my baby over anyone's feelings. 

Another edit: baby is 12 week pp and this gathering we were reluctant to have but agreed on as long as no one showed up sick and no kissing which wasnt respected ",3,1734365275.0,beyondthebump,0,1.0,False

1hfmex8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OutrageousSpread8706/comments/1hfmex8/update_kids_left_and_wife_immediately_tried/,UPDATE - Kids left and wife immediately tried something,"
Hi guys. Kids left yesterday for the Europe. My mother came last monday. VERY TOUGH 7 days are behind me. As I said multiple times, my mother is the only person I trust 100% in my life but she is probably the only one from my family and inner circle of friends that supports reconciliation fully. I knew that so her behaviour these 6 days didn't shock me. She always says she will support whatever decision I make but if I ask her, I should forgive my wife. I asked her would she forgive my father in the same scenario and she said she would. So whatever.

Anyway, when she arrived kids and I went to pick her up at the airport. She asked me few times in the car about my wife in our language so the kids can't understand. I told her what I told her so many times before the flight: ""Don't make any type of scene, don't cry and for the love of God don't push me to talk with her!""
Everytime she said she will not do anything of that. We arrived, wife was waiting for us in front of the gates, on the street. We didn't even leave the car and my mother was already a mess. She left the car and my wife hugged her and they are both sobbing like 2 lunatics on the street. Luckily they entered the house very soon. My mother immediately started with the questions in my language (wife understands a lot but talks 50-60%): ""why did you do it S? What were you thinking? Look at you! You lost so much weight you are like a pencil now. You broke my heart also....etc."" My wife was crying, apologizing and was looking at the floor. 

I took kids in the room and told them to turn on PS5. Told my older son to keep an eye on my daughter and that I will arrive in 5 minutes. I went downstairs and I told my mother that I hate what she did right now. She didn't respect one fucking thing I told her. We literally just entered the house, kids were around them and she immediately started with her shitshow... Wife was still crying and I told her to stop with fucking crying for once and clean herself. Things were okay later that day. Kids are crazy about my mother and were really happy to see her after so many months.

I told Melody to tell me anything between mother and wife in the next days when I am at work. Daughter didn't go in the kindergarten whole week to be with them. My wife works from home but still she is not 7 hours straight on PC. Melody told me my mother and wife would only speak in my language so she didn't understand them. But she said that she heard my mother sometimes speaking very loud and in her opinion angry to my wife and that my wife was visibly upset. When I was at home things were cool. Mother apologized to me about the 1st day because of her reaction when she saw my wife. What I saw was that them were cooking dinners, drinking coffees and going out with all the kids. My older son accepted to go out with my wife if my mother was there. We spent time like we are one happy family!!!!! 

In saturday my mother talked with me alone for good 90 minutes. She was emotional and she told me she can finally understand now how I am feeling. She said she will not tell me what to do, she will not criticise me about anything and I am free to do whatever I want. According to my mother, her opinion about my wife didn't change. Yes, she did the worst thing possible but she is the same person and she still has all the good things inside her that she had when she met her the 1st time. She can see she can't be more remorseful than she is now but she just can't understand why she did that. She asked her so many times and they talked about AP and my wife was swearing on kids and family that she never had any feelings for AP and is disgusted by him, she loves me, she is only attracted to me...etc. All the shit she said so many times. My mother asked her ""then why did you do it?"" And then she said that in IC she realized she took me for granted and wanted attention and validation that she was getting when she was single and younger. Something clicked that night in her head when she saw AP and rest is history. This is something new from her at least. At the end my mother told me she was so proud on me when I finished the college, moved to Asia because of work, did XYZ things but that all of that together is not even close how much proud she is right now. I really needed this. You know, a lot of people around me think I am good. They all tell me I have everything (Melody, not problems with the money, Sung, good job, kids love me) so I should move on easily. People just don't understand how shitty situation this is until this become your reality.

Sung is really not happy about everything that is going on because I am really honest and open with her so I told her everything about my mother and wife. She hates that my mother has sympathy for my wife. I hate it also honestly but it is what it is. I know if any of my sons would be in this situation I would not say a word to their cheating wives ever again. Yesterday when kids and mother left I spent the rest of the day with her but I returned late in the night back home. My wife was on the couch awake and I honestly expected that she will start with some shit because I took kids and mother on the airport and then I wrote her message that they are in the plane and I didn't come home for 12 hours after that. She sent me messages asking where am I after few hours. I told her it's none of her business but she said she was just worried and apologized. Anyway she went to sleep after me and didn't say a thing. Well today she did. 

After I came home from the work she immediately told me she wants to talk. I didn't want to but then she said that she just wants this one talk and after that she will not ask me for any talk as long as we are alone. So I said OK. She started with some crappy intro like asking me how am I, is everything ok with my job...blah, blah..so I told her to cut the crap and start with the serious things. She said A LOT of things so I probably forgot a lot of stuff and probably most of the things I will write are not in the exact order and obviously I am not quoting every sentence she said correctly so this will be very likely one huge word salad. She thanked me again for the chance I gave her. She is also thankful for not serving her yet. Then she said she will say it all because kids are not here and she is not scared of my reaction. She thinks I am seeing someone but she thinks maybe I have sex with escorts and not with someone I spend time with. My daily behaviour tells her that. I didn't ask what does she mean by this but now I regret for not asking her because I am really curious what can she see...I told her she is free to think whatever she wants and I will not explain what I do in my life to her. Then she said if this is true what she thinks she can't do a lot of things about that except to pray daily that any type of relationship I have with someone stops as soon as possible. 

And then surprise. She asked me to give her a real chance. After asking her what does she mean by that she said she wants to sign some paper/agreement where I can't divorce her before 2026. So I would give her more than 1 year of time to repair our marriage. We can be friends, FWB, partners...anything just to keep her around me. She will take any crumbs of love and wait for me to forgive her but it hurts her to see me being with someone else but she can't say anything because she destroyed our marriage. She still doesn't understand why she did all of this but in IC she realized she always wanted attention when she was younger and she definitely took me for granted like what she said to my mother. It was nothing wrong with me (no shit Sherlock!) and we were so long together and she didn't appreciate everything I do daily because she took me for granted. She lost her head and went from one mistake to another. She said she felt like she was on drugs when they made a plans for the first meeting and AP was a copy of me when she met me. Cocky, direct and mysterious. He was very interesting, made her laugh, they started to talk daily when I was at work and she forgot on all boundaries and it was harmless fun for her. 

She didn't have any plans to have sex with AP at 1st meeting but she wasn't thinking normal and she gave up on his first move when they met in the bar near his condo and first sex happened. For the 2nd sex they had she justified things in her head by picking all the shit I did wrong in our marriage + attention was nice. She can explain everything but can't explain why she was thinking like this and her therapist is trying to help her understand her own thoughts. Apparently she could always see attention I would receive from the women. From my female colleagues on the working events she attended with me or at the work, from the unknown girls in the restaurants, bars, birthday parties...or either from her friends because they would always say the best things about my look, career and about me being a great father and husband and that she is the luckiest woman ever and that I am amazing catch. This sometimes made her feel she is not good enough and this would hit her self-esteem. She said she felt good receiving attention from good looking younger guy and this boosted her self-esteem and she didn't sacrifice attention and validation she was getting from good looking young guy for me. In her eyes she was again hot from all the attention he gave her.

Idk what to say about this to be honest. Sometimes I feel like she is mentally ill. Every time after the sex she would ran away because she knew what she did is horrible but attention after 1st time was still nice and she was shocked about everything so she didn't even think normal. After 2nd time attention was not worth it anymore and knew she is not even slightly attracted to AP and he makes her sick. She swears on kids, herself, parents, God (she is very religious...irony, right?) that she never had any feelings for him and that she didn't like sex at all and she said even polygraph confirmed that. 3rd and the final 4th time they had sex she did it because she was scared he might tell me when she refused to meet him. She knows it was huge mistake but she was complete idiot and he had huge advantage over her because she was scared of losing me and the kids. It was short and she would leave minute after.

In her defense messages she sent to her ex POS friend are basically about this. She said AP would always have comments ""I think your husband has a nice voice. I wanna hear it"", ""I might ask your husband for threesome""...AP told me she refused to meet him a lot of times and would always ran away after the sex but he never told me anything about this. To be honest, I believe her because this doesn't repair image of her at all in my eyes and she knows it. According to her when she ended everything with AP she didn't care anymore. She was ready that AP might tell me but she didn't want anything with him anymore because she realized what she did and was disgusted by herself but she truly believed he will never tell me. And she didn't plan to tell me, at least not before kids become grown people and she had plans to go in IC week before Dday. She finished her proposal by saying that she will work, sign postnup, keep going to IC, she will do everyhing she promised in ""her changes"" till the rest of her life and she will show me until 2026. that she really loves me and she thinks I still love her but I am very hurt so I am probably seeking NSA sex with other girls. If I still want to divorce her in 2026. she will accept my decision and she will respect everything. She just wants 50-50 custody and will try everything to stay in Asia.

Ofc, I rejected it. I told her it's the biggest insult possible of all the things she said when she brought the idea of us being FWB. I was very rude when I explained her why I don't want to touch her. I don't want to come near her lips, belly, ass, tits, vagina....nowhere near where AP was doing his ""magic"". She started to cry and said she misses me and intimacy with me. I told her we won't have sex and I don't care what she wants and misses. Then I explained her why I didn't serve her for one more time. It doesn't have anything with my feelings. Yes, I do love her still but I also hate her. I told her 2025. will be the last year of our marriage. She broke down when I said this and started to ask me what can she do for me to at least keep her near me and kids for one more year. I told her there is nothing she can do. If she wants my forgiveness she can have it. ""Here, I forgive you!"" But I will never forget and I can't live like that. I told her that her biggest hope is that I survive in some type of car accident and I lose my memory. 

Everything I said didn't help. Her conclusion is that she will fight till the end and she will not lose the hope. She will work every day as hardest as she can on herself so I can notice she is the same woman I met 11.5 years ago. Even if I divorce her she will still work on herself and wait for me and is not interested in anyone else. Then she said that 4th kid would connect us again or fresh start somewhere else where she would still follow ""her changes"". I stopped conversation because it was too much for me but to be honest I wasn't angry or furious. I was just feeling bad. Is that true sadness? Am I just tired? Is that indifference? Love? I have no idea. Therapist told me to write every single detail in these 9 days so we will talk after Christmas about all of this so I vent here right now. She made a dinner but I didn't eat it and she wanted to throw everything in the garbage. I had pizza and was on the couch while she was watching me from the table in the dining room. She went to sleep immediately after that very early and now I am writing this. Tomorrow I will be with Sung most of the day, probably will sleep at her place. 

I have to tell you one more thing. I know all of you will say I am paranoid or insane. I have a key for my bedroom. And I lock it daily since wife returned home when I leave the house. But few times I noticed some things were not in the exact spot I left. At first I thought I am insane but then I started to think my wife maybe enters my/her ex bedroom. We had one more key for the bedroom but we lost it long time ago. Actually I lost it somewhere in the house. So now I think she maybe found it. Last night when I arrived from Sung I saw my working papers being on the right side of the table. I am left handed and I always keep any type of papers on the left side of the working table. I have some type of OCD about these things. Maybe I left it there, idk, but probability is 5%. When kids were still here I noticed one time that something was weird with my walk-in closet. Like someone was searching for something. It was messy a little bit and when I left the house it was all good.

I saw that couple of hours after I arrived home so maybe my kids were searching for something but I doubt it. I know Melody wasn't because she left earlier and she is the only one that puts clothes in my closet. Also one time I saw my office chair has been left on the weird angle. Ok, I am not sure about this because I really don't remember on what angle I left my chair that day but almost every time I put it close to the table when I am done with the work. Tomorrow and every day from now on before I leave the house I will take pictures of every detail in my room and home office. Exact spot where my papers are, pencils, mouse, keyboard, perfumes, clothes...etc. If I see something on the different angle or spot then we will have huuuuuuuuge problem. So we will see, maybe I am just paranoid but I have a weird feeling. 

When kids return I have crazy 8 days. Christmas eve, Christmas, son's birthday, 4 days after daughter's birthday, NYE, New Year...My friend who is engaged to Sung's best friend told me they will make a Christmas dinner and he expects me to come with kids, MIL and wife but I really doubt I will come because that is one huge disaster in the making with me, wife, MIL, Sung and kids at the same table. Also few other friends of mine that doesn't like my wife after the affair will be there... I am crazy but not crazy enough to put myself in this kind of position.

I wish you all Merry Christmas and enjoy in the holidays with your families and friends. Have a great time!

I nod and say under my breath, and this, oh yeah. Ice cream. Chocolate we drank. Kayaks. Ice cream in Bologna. Bathtub. Orange. Seagulls. Flying by plane. Great sex. Molehills. Coffee. Working on a construction site, panels, moving slabs. Cakes, aquapark, billiards in the green. Croatia. Axe. Borrowing a Fabia when the Seat died.  
  
I also think of the difficult ones. When you weren't there. Holidays. There were... a lot of them. And the hard way. You even distanced yourself from WhatsApp messages. About months on the construction site. About the court, and fear. About ideas for bankruptcy. Those weren't my moments. Those were - only yours. A fight in which I couldn't help you because you rejected my help. Or I couldn't.  
  
There really were fewer and fewer of those good moments. I looked - was it me who created them after all? Together. Together, happy that I had someone to share them with? You really didn't want them? You're not allowed to play? You really didn't want to?... My towel is thrown.  
  
There was more and more anger and hurt, though. Doing things to spite you - or ""favors"" like, I'll move away and make space for you, maybe you'll come when you're pushed away. That maybe your anxious part is being activated, the one that was so strong with Cezary, thanks to which you felt so in love with him...  
My anxious part, maybe more and more secure, still wants a close relationship. You're still an important part of my world - and there's not much left next to your place. It's just that your place is empty.  
  
And my place? In your world, it's somewhere far, far away.  
  
You don't even know how sad I am. You don't even know how many times I've repeated this.  
  
But really, I only see hope for good moments, not for a good life. We've been struggling for almost two years. Two years now, and you don't know that you have to spend the holidays and your sister's birthday with me, and I can't say it any differently. If you don't understand that we have common plans, and you see your plans and mine as independent, then I don't even know what to say. I didn't even agree to your ideas. And nothing.  
  
And you said we don't have common plans for the future... How can we have them if you don't keep them?  
  
And now I stare like a helpless calf at your WhatsApp account and write to you and delete dozens of messages.  
  
What would have to happen? Is there any point in writing this? I made such a list when G was leaving. There's no point. If something, anything, starts happening, I'll start writing it. For today, I should bury you and pretend you never existed.  
  
I'm so sorry that I couldn't help you. I'm so sorry that I couldn't change you with my closeness. I'm so sorry that instead of coming and trusting me, you started running away. I'm so sorry that I wasn't able to set boundaries like a man earlier and say what I wanted calmly, only with nerves - I'm just learning. I am so sorry that you have been organizing and organizing your time so much that you have nothing to do with me. That in your head you value it so low. I am so sorry that you are fighting for survival. I am so sorry that even though I was by your side, you did not find support in me to survive – and if you did, it was cynical. I guess that kills warm feelings? I am so sorry that you said goodbye so easily – but does that only confirm that what I did was right?  
  
When you wrote that I am helpless in seeing your world, it is not like that. I understand it, I just do not believe in it. As for helplessness, yes – I could not tell you that it is not true, these fears. I could not convince you that time together is valuable – so I had to start spending it with others. Yes, it is a failure.

So far, I’ve noticed cortisone shot completely throws my BG out of whack - higher fasting levels, random spikes, spikes even with usually safe foods, exercising won’t bring down my BG like it normally would. 

I also noticed when I had really bad carb filled meal on Thanksgiving, my BG was out of whack for 2 days - although not as bad as cortisone shot. 

Today, I had work problems. Had to start work early, so I skipped breakfast and my usual morning exercise. Drank 2 extra cups of black coffee (instead of my usual 1 cup), and was kinda stressed out. I woke up with BG at 108. Since then my BG has been, 146, 124, 134 - all on empty stomach (except black coffee). Finally sitting down to eat something and go for a walk after, so hopefully my BG gets back to behaving normally.

**Long time no see!**
Sorry I haven't made a review in awhile! 

Let's jump right into this! 

Vireo Health made their own version of an ice cream cake strain cart! Select previously had them and I've done reviews on it but this is vireo's health version!!

It's super fresh for one! The date on the packaging says **Nov 20th 2024**, so less than a month ago if you are reading this on December 13th! 

It tastes like it too! 

**Upon exhale**:
Super bright berry flavors with a nice undertone of coffee! I really, really loved it! Vireo's carts taste just like flower! All their fresh select brand ones do!!
I felt an instant sense of releif and calm. My eyes got super low right away. It feels like ice cream cake for sure. 


**Effects:**
Slight focus behind the eyes. Stoney. Amazing calming effect, relax effects. My body keeps unwinding and feeling nice. I'm getting more and more sedated but not completely sleepy. If I hit this a couple more times, it **probably would though**.

**Update on effects after an hour:**
Yeah, this gets *heavy*! If you do plan to hit it multiple times, be prepared for a couch lock effect! It gets really heavy behind the eyes too! It does have a hybrid vibe cuz it's very psychedelic-ly and euphoric but ice cream cake is crossed with wedding cake and it **shows/feels like it.**   

It's definitely one of their stronger vapes!! I really liked it and use it during the day sometimes if I really want to vibe out and just chill. 

I love ice cream cake. I love it in flower and in carts. It's one of the strains for me that if I see it on the market, I gotta cop it, no matter what brand it is. 

**Taste** 8/10
**Effects** 10/10
**Overall rating**
9/10

I honestly *might* like curaleafs/selects version better but it's a very close tie!!!! This stuff is loud. I'm pretty stoned off 2 hits. I might hit it more and change my mind on that one! It's a nice dreamy, calm, Stoney high. Indica-doninant hybrid vibe. It's listed as a hybrid on the packaging as well. I would agree. You can use this just before bed or if you want to activate a hard-core chill mode in your day. Loosens up muscles even. Nice body high effects. 

I dig it so much.

1hfm21o,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1hfm21o/10_years_of_slavery_ch20/,10 Years of Slavery - Ch.20,"We kept lying on the bed. I was between her legs, my head was resting on her thigh. My face was covered in her juices. My dick was already limp inside the condom. We kept our silence and enjoyed the moment. You would expect a feeling of regret after having an orgasm, but it definitely wasn't what I felt. At least until later.

After a while, we heard guest bedroom's door opening. It was Kyle. He went to the living room and turned the TV on. We were able to hear distant sounds of a late-night shitty advertisement. Ellie reached to her phone and started texting. I was still between her thighs, resting my cheecks on her soft thighs. I was unable to see who she's texting, but I knew that it was Kyle. I watched her beautiful face under the dim light of her phone, she had a naughty smile on her lips.

""He is filthy..."" Said she, and turned her phone towards me to read. Ellie was the first one to text:

""You awake? Is everything OK?""

""Yep just couldn't sleep. Mind if I watch some TV?""

""Not at all. Enjoy!""

""Is he sleeping???""

""Yep...""

""Then you can join me too if you fancy""

""To watch TV?""

""To have fun.""

""You're so indecent... he can wake up""

""Then you can send him to get more ice cream???""

I read the texts with a deep hatred. I was pissed for his audacity, but Ellie wasn't thinking the same:

""Isn't it so funny that he thinks he's being smart and sneaky?""

""Will you go? Please don't.""

She ignored me and kept texting.

""Please Ellie, you've punished me enough already today.""

She then knitted her pretty brows and turned her eyes to me:

""Punish? Was I punishing you? I'm not doing anything to you. It's not about you. How selfish you are boy?""

""I'm sorry I didn't mean that...""

""I know what you meant. But right now I'm not trying to humiliate you or whatever. I'm just horny as fuck and there's only one dick I can ride in this house now. Right?""

""Yes, you're right."" I said with a defeat. She gently pushed my head aside, put on her underwear, and silently left the room. Soon, the TV's sound turned on a little. It took me long to stop pitying myself and fall asleep.

I don't know when she returned, but she was sleeping next to me when I woke up. I checked guest bedroom, and Kyle was still there sleeping half-naked. While waiting them to wake up, I tidied up the living room. They woke up towards noon, and we had a breakfast together. I was cooking for the guy who thinks he's fucking my girlfriend behind my back. He was overly polite, and stayed silent the entire time. Almost avoiding me I'd say. He wanted to leave before breakfast but Ellie insisted. I knew that she was making me to endure this suffering as long as possible.

Once he left, she told me that he was baffled how clueless I was. She ensured him that I was just too drunk and sleeping like a log. But luckily she didn't go into detail on what they did last night. And I never insisted.

I never get to read them again but they started texting occassionally after that night. A week later, Ellie told me that Kyle will be coming over to work on a class project that evening. Knowing what that means, I asked if she wants me out. But to my suprise, she wanted me to stay and prepare a dinner.

""So, aren't you gonna...""

""Fuck? Yeah of course I am gonna fuck him. Did you really think that I'm planning to do a fucking school work?""

I wasn't sure how it'd happen while I'm also at home but I didn't want to hear her plans at the moment, so I didn't ask anything. Instead, I started cooking for them; my girlfriend and her ""secret"" lover while she was getting prepared.

Kyle arrived a couple hours later. Ellie had an oversized white t-shirt without a bra and sweat shorts. Her nipples weren't bulging this time, but her legs and feet naked again, which was definitely a turn-on for me. And probably for Kyle too. We had dinner together before they start. Soon after, Ellie told me that they'll start studying and if I can clean up the table for them. While I was doing what I'm told, they moved to the sofa and didn't bothered to help me. It was an awkward moment as they were just hanging around while I am basically serving them. I was also odd that Kyle was acting quite comfortable. Ellie again had her legs on the sofa, extended towards Kyle. I knew that she was doing it on purpose, somehow knowing that it makes me extra jealous. They started chatting about the school gossip but I didn't care to listen. I couldn't stand them being casual.

Soon, I made myself scarce and left them alone to suffer in silence in our room. At some point I tried to listen, but couldn't hear any sound. After an hour or so, I heard Ellie calling for my name. They were sitting on the table. Kyle was facing towards the wall and scribbling something on paper, so I couldn't see his expression. But Ellie was quite cheerful. She asked me to make them coffee. Once I brought their coffee and about to leave the room, she asked for one more thing with a giggle:

""Pinky can you also bring me my socks? Your lovers are getting cold..."" She looked at me with her most daring look again, with a smile on the corner of her lips. I heard Kyle chuckling. Without a word, I left the room and returned with a pair of warm socks.

""Thanks babe, put them on please."" She had her legs crossed, and without moving from her chair she raised her leg towards me. She was playing with my mind again. I thought that this was the punishment I was asking about the other day. I had no other chance than getting on my knees and endure the humiliation in front of Kyle. I felt that familiar burning sensation on my face. Again, without a word I got on my knees in front of her and started putting on her socks. Inevitably, I was aroused for being close to her feet, on my knees in front of her. It's hard to admit, but I felt that having someone else, someone she's about to fuck on the room was making it even more provocating.

""You're a quite useful boyfriend."" Said Kyle shamelessly.

""Yeah I guess I am..."" I murmured.

""Don't pick on him, he's just being lovely."" She replied.

""Aren't you gonna kiss your girlfriends goodbye before tucking them in?"" Kyle was getting bolder.

""Come here!"" Ellie said to my suprise, and reached towards me. And, she kissed me on my lips. It was a brief moment, but it was lovely. I felt honored for being defended. It was a lovely moment for me indeed. Couldn't hide my happiness, I said that I'll be in my room if they need anything and left the room again. But I didn't get called again until they're done studying. I tried to be very silent to hear any voices, but I only heard very silent mutterings.

When I heard my name being called, I rushed. They were still sitting on the table. Ellie was looking mischievous while she told me that Kyle will be staying in our place again, and if I can bring something for him to change and make up his bed. So, this is how it'll happen, I said to myself while leaving the room. When I was making up the guest bed, Kyle went to toilet to change. Soon, we were in our room alone with Ellie, supposedly going to sleep. When we closed the door, she let out an audible lough and let herself on the bed again. It was my call to start kissing her feet. So I assumed my position.

""Take off my socks first babe. I want to feel your lips. By the way I was cold for real, hope you didn't mind that?"" She said. I didn't reply, but taking off her socks and kissing her feet must've shown her that I didn't mind indeed. She was in a very good mood. While I was kissing her feet obediently she finally told me the reason why they were so silent:

""That was so fun. Do you want to listen?"" She asked as if I had a choice. I replied with a kiss on her toes. She continued:

""He was super confused, and expecting something to happen for sure but didn't know how to start while you're around. So I told him that I'll silently give him a handjob until we're done studying, and only if he can hold himself then I'll send you out and fuck him. He was excited but he raised the challenge, he was going to fuck me in any position he wants if I can't make him cum. He was very confident so I took the challenge and he immediately unzipped and popped his cock out. At some point he complained my hands being so cold, that's when I asked you to bring us coffee. I warmed my hands on the mug. So I stroked him casually while we pretend studying. You know, as I used to do for you, slowly. I was using mostly my fingertips to play with the head of his cock. And I admit that I really wanted to suck him at some point but deal is deal so I only used my hands. Then he wanted to distract himself I guess and asked me about you and howcome I'm so clueless and submissive around her. I told him that I love you, and that's true, but I also like fooling around and there's no harm unless you learn about it. Also I told him that you are just a very sweet boy and don't care about what people think, and instead just try to keep me happy. Now thinking it was quite strange as I was just jerking him off while saying this. But you know that it's true. Well, mostly true. Anyways. After a while he gave up and laid back on the chair, and let me finish him. He came all over his t-shirt. And that's why I asked you to bring something for him to wear. I loved how he desperately tried to hide that wetness on her shirt. Do you think that I'm sick for enjoying this so much?""

She moved her feet slowly to reveal my face underneath, and looked at my eyes. That was a genuine question. So I had to reply:

""It's definitely unusual for many people, but you're not one of them and that what makes you special babe.""

""I'll take that. Thanks pinky you're so sweet.""

""But then he lost the bet?""

""Seems so haha, he was super upset after the orgasm for losing. I'm still gonna fuck him but he doesn't know that. But in any position I want. Which is another thing I enjoy maybe too much.""

She then parted her legs, giving me the signal to go down on her. I obediently followed her command. Before I start, she told me to be gentle. She was only looking to get properly wet before going to Kyle's room. I started with small kisses, then sucked her clit slowly, licked her vagina. All very gentle, while she was stroking my hair. After about ten minutes, she pulled my hair lightly. She was pretty much ready for a real dick. Which is something I don't have. Before getting up, she looked at my eyes:

""You look upset. What's the problem? I want you to be happy too Pinky. Don't forget our deal, OK? You should crave to satisfy my needs. You cannot be upset when I fuck someone else. You should be delighted instead. I thought we're already over this?""

""I know Ellie, but it's so hard when you do it in the next room. And with him...""

""You're being ridiculous now. I never understand how your mind works. But I don't care."" After a brief pause, she continued:

""You know what? I actually care. Here's the deal. I want to fuck him, and you want me not to, right?""

""No I don't me...""

""Cut the bullshit and be honest. Am I right?"" She interrupted me assertively. Her eyes were locked on mine, demanding for an answer. I chose to be honest:

""Yes.""

""OK then, If you really want that, I won't. But I know that you're such a good slave and you want the best for your owner. So, I also guess that you'll start begging me to go and fuck him. Like you did before. Am I right?"" She still had that decisive tone on her voice. I knew that she was dead serious. I had nowhere to hide. I started kissing her already wet pussy:

""I am sorry Ellie. I beg you to go and fuck him. Let him slide in your pussy and fuck it good. Please baby, don't let him stop until you orgasm, and cover him with your wetness. Let him cum inside you. Make him suck your tits while jumping on his cock. Let him pound you so good that your pussy hurts. I will wait for you in our bed, and lick you until you're soothed. Please baby, I beg you....""

She was enjoying that so much that I realised that she's close to the orgasm. I was super horny at that point as well, but with an unexpected willpower, I stopped myself:

""I don't want to ruin your orgasm with my tongue, my princess. Please go and get what you deserve. I'll wait for your return.""

Ellie's face brightened up for my dedication:

""You're getting better and better... go and pick lingerie for me. Let me see your best taste.""

I left my spot between her thighs immediately, and went onto her wardrobe. I picked a matching black lace bra and knickers for her -the ones I loved to see on her pure skin. She got up, and let me dress her for the man I despise. I slid the think laced knickers on her legs, hardly keeping myself from burying my face between her thighs. Her wetness was already making the garment soaked. Then I put the bra on. She left the room only wearing her underwear, and I heard her knocking the guest bedroom.",1,1734364159.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

Don’t know if this is a silly question but I noticed whenever a mom Instagram show their living room, the coffee table is always missing (sometimes a play pen instead). I have a round marble coffee table that we love but it seems like the perfect height for the LO to bump his head on. Luckily it’s quite heavy so he won’t be able to grab it and it’ll topple over him but don’t know if it’s something that we should still keep around.

Does everyone just get rid of theirs once their LO is at the crawling/cruising age?

From her vantage point, she could clearly hear their conversation; and what she witnessed was both shocking and disappointing. The writers, reflecting on their recent success with the first three seasons, began to discuss season four and if they should make any script changes to accommodate one of the cast member's schedule. It soon became apparent that the entire show, even Fromville itself, is complete fiction. The writers have been making it all up all along, sometimes over coffee and blueberry waffles. At the peak of the conversation, the reporter overheard discussion of turning the entire cast into bananas and shooting them motionless on a table for the rest of the show. The idea was quickly dismissed by the majority of the group but seemed to gain traction later. This is a developing story. We will focus on reports from police officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops.",0,1734363959.0,FromSeries,6,0.18,False

i've been reading through different posts and theres all in one machines to people buying a separate grinder and all and it's got me very confused.

Also, i would say we both don't drink just a regular dark espresso but usually lates / cappuccinos.

But it's my fault. I promised myself I would spend some shop time every week. I promised. First of all, I'm a better person to be around when I spend a little time in my church. This is my meditation. This alone time with my favorite person. Me. (If only that were true.) But I need this time for me and I need it for him. My armor needs to grow and evolve. It needs to surprise everyone and at the same time be that thing everyone can count on. It's all my metaphors.

After designs for his suits were leaked on the Internet and a 15-year-old named Riri Williams built her own suit of armor, Tony Stark realized he needed to put his nose to the grindstone and build a state-of-the-art multipurpose suit to blow away the competition. Using designs that incorporated millions of individual scales, Tony created the [Model Prime armor](https://imgur.com/a/htFIRoL) to act as a kind of Swiss army knife. The scales could move around on the surface of the armor to change shapes, fulfilling any kind of specialized function that Iron Man could need in an extremely lightweight, collapsible package.

Tony would wear this armor during the formation of an All New, All Different roster of the Avengers and during his conflict with Captain Marvel in the second superhuman Civil War. After waking up from his coma following a fight with Captain Marvel at the Capitol building, he'd move onto an updated version of his old Extremis armor.

**Notes**

During *Infamous Iron Man*, Victor von Doom stole the technology from the Model 51 and heavily modified it in order to become a better superhero than Tony Stark. [Feats from this version of the suit can be found here](https://redd.it/8tf8b2).

1hflx1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hflx1x/m24_gf_f22_gets_jealous_easy_help/,(M24) Gf (F22) gets jealous easy. Help?,"I (M24) have been with my GF (F22) for almost little more than a year. In this time we found a deep connection (or so I think) and for the most part see eye to eye on most things. I’m a very committed man, raised Christian and have been through many break ups and I went through therapy due to these break ups and wouldn’t wish the mental torture I went through even on my worst enemy.

Except her jealousy. 

Now my GF is a bit ditsy, she often doesn’t understand obvious jokes or sarcasm and often takes everything said by anyone seriously, assuming she was ever checked into the conversation in the first place.

At first it started with my instagram reel recommendations as I follow a lot of Fitness pages a lot of those OF fitness reels tend to pop up on there, she will say, “What are you looking at?” And I respond, “Someone who has a little to much self confidence.” And mind you I skip all these reels as I find them annoying and gross. She retorts, “Uh huh sure.” 
Like I already skipped it, I give a back handed and mildly rude comment about it and I’m some how still I’m “looking”

I brushed it off cause sure they are literally selling their bodies. Fast forward to a time we were at the gym and she was watching the anime “Demon slayer.” And one of the characters has 3 wives and she shows my like “all three of them are his wives.” Where sarcastically I respond, “damn kinda jealous.” Then she gets upset at me for genuinely thinking I would stop her for 3 animated drawings of women. Which at this point I was already having a bad day and go to the gym as my safe space and she wanted to tag with me I thought it would make it better (wrong). We talked about it when we got home and albeit I was a little assertive because she was jealous of drawings, she promised me she would work on it and for the most part she has. Other than continuing to make comments about instagram reels.

About a year goes by and we end up at a restaurant where my roommate worked because I like to mess with them. The bartender working that night looked very very familiar to me and it bugged me that I couldn’t remember if I actually did. This didn’t take away from me talking to my GF who was there but I couldn’t help that feeling of dejavu whenever the bartender walked by often muttering how much it bugs me. But to my GF I was staring at her and because the bartender is much bigger than my GF she said something like it’s because she has boobs from what I can remember. I tried to remain calm and tell her it’s nothing just that she looks familiar and anyone in my spot would do the exact same as me. But because she isn’t like that I’m wrong and there is something wrong with what I’m doing. At this point I already told her jealousy is gross and unattractive as it makes me feel like she has no faith in our relationship or me as she constantly thinks I’ll leave her for another woman. Often when we argue she defaults to self deprecation saying how she’s not enough, and I’m just gonna leave and etc etc. when I have always said that no matter what I chose her and I constantly show that to her as even in public I’m touchy and try to be the best boyfriend I can be.

Nothing happens for about a couple months. At this point we have moved in as I believed we hashed out at least the biggest issues we had. But the last couple days we went to Starbucks and I am kind to people who work food service as I’ve been there and I like to make other peoples day a bit better even if it’s a simple “how are you doing today?” But to my GF it sounds like I’m “Flirting” with whomever is on the intercom. And especially yesturday the woman who made my coffee messed up and gave me a free size up and I expressed how appreciative I was that she didn’t charge me but again my GF accused me of Flirting with her despite the woman being around the age of my mom or older and not that attractive to me. Told her again what her jealousy does to me and asked her if I ever gave her a reason not to trust me and all she could think to say is, “I trust you I don’t trust them.” And I ask her “then what’s the problem? If you trust me to come back to you there should be no issue.”
“What if she gave you her number.”
“I’ll throw it away?”
“You’d take it in front of me?”
“I doubt anyone would try that, especially if they’re working.”
“Well I kinda look like a dude right now, sooo.”
“If they thought that chances are they’d put in the receipt or my cup so I’d just throw it away later. When I’m done.”
“Whatever…”

I told her after that she needs to stop this jealousy BS. I told her I’m not just gonna stop being nice, so if people think I’m flirting it’s not my problem and I’m not gonna entertain anything if they flirt with me. I feel really grossed out whenever she does this and it feels like she’s trying to control who I talk to and how I talk to them. She often sends me instagram reels that are captioned “how my GF expect me to do XYZ to other women.” And it’s often a clip of some dude being rude.

I hate jealousy as I used to be this way but I never once told my SO she shouldn’t talk to other guys but I did make aware it makes me uncomfortable as I’ve been cheated on a couple times. But my current SO is not them and I often meditate my way through these thoughts but when I am dealing with her jealousy it grosses me out, upsets me, and makes me feel like I’m choking. Idk how to proceed with her, I wanna slam the hammer down and tell her that if it continues it’ll be a problem but she often mentally shuts down whenever we have an argument especially if she starts it.

TL;DR GF gets jealous whenever I even look at another woman and It makes me regret her moving in with me.

1hfluur,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hfluur/weight_loss_fatigue_lumps/,"Weight loss, fatigue, lumps","20 Female Asian 158cm 57kg to 53kg

I was depressed for a while and I didn't really go outside and had only one meal a day, less than 2 meals which I usually had. Had this lifestyle for about 3 months and in October alone I lost 4 kilograms. Weight loss is visible in my face, arms, chest, and legs. I started to have strong fatigue around this time and I feel tired even though I sleep 12 hours a day. Drinking coffee doesn't help either.

I began to notice my right shoulder and neck getting stiff and around November 20th I found a visible hard unmovable painless lump on my right neck. I went to the doctor after a week and was prescribed Nsaids. Had them for 3 days and the lump didn't go away. Instead, it spread to 3-4 other clustered lumps below that were painful when I press it. 

I then went to another hospital, and had ultrasound of my neck. The doctor told me the inflated lumps didn't look 'bad', but the size being over 3cm was unusual, saying it could be Kikuchi's disease and I got blood tested. Also had fine needle biopsy on one of the newly inflated lumps twice. I was prescribed oral steroids and I took 20mg a day for a week until the test result arrived. The biopsy results showed reactive lymphadenopathy type 2. It wasn't kikuchi.

I stopped taking meds after the test result so in conclusion I took Nsaids for 3days, and steroids for a week. Now it's been a week since I stopped taking meds. The initial lump that used to be hard unmovable and painless  seems to be gone or be much smaller as I can't find it. The newer lumps that appeared in a cluster are still there, but way smaller than before and painless. It seems like the lumps were nothing serious. 

But my family and I are worried it could be sign of cancer as I am experiencing constant fatigue and weight loss. I trust the doctor but the test results are not 100% right too. I know I had ate less calories during time of weight loss, but I used to experience similar depression before but I didn't lost weight at all before. All my life I have never experienced such sudden weight loss, especially in my arms, butt, and legs. It usually was my face and belly that got skinnier before when I lost weight. 

My appetite recovered in November and I didn't see such weight changes in number but still feel like my legs and arms are getting skinnier. I would love to hear your advice on getting further tested for cancer, especially lymphoma. I only have these three symptoms of lymphoma and I haven't experienced any other symptoms such as sweating at night or strong fever. Thank you for reading!",1,1734363624.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

And if I should make more can you give e me a suggestion, I was thinking saying it was all a dream but she did really get kidnapped, not sure though.
Story:
The Window
	The air in the room felt stale and hot when I started to walk to my room to go to bed around 10:30. On my way to bed, I walked to the window for a nice, chilly breeze to help me sleep. Opening the window always created a shrill creak that raised the hairs on the back of my neck, shrill and sharp like nails on a chalkboard. It always creeped me out, but the cool air was worth it. I checked around the house making sure no one was there. I laid down on my bed trying to make myself comfortable before turning the lamp off. It was 10:52 when I looked over to the clock drifting off. 
	I had not been asleep long when I awoke with a startle; my skin crawling with the sensation that someone or something was there. I turned on my lights as quickly as possible to see what made me wake up. At first, the lights were blinding, making it hard to see but my eyes slowly started to adjust. I looked around to see nothing but the nearby clock, the glowing digits reading 12:33. My window was still wide open. I did not remember opening it that far, but maybe it was just my imagination. I was tired, after all. Still tired and thinking about work in the morning, I decided to go back to sleep, leaving the light on just in case something was there. 
	It was around 12:45 when I closed my eyes again thinking maybe finally, I can get some good sleep. I was quickly reawakened by another noise - the window slamming shut. My eyes shot open in time to see a face in the window, gaunt and smiling. I jumped back in shock, rubbing my eyes, but when I reopened them, no one was there. Disturbed and uneasy, I got up to check around the house. “Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks on me and making me hear and see things” I think to myself.
	I go to check the kitchen thinking it may be the fridge that is making the unknown noise because I have had trouble with it waking me up in the past. I walk into the hallway, checking behind me as I go, but I see nothing. It was very dark and the only light illuminating the hallway was my bedroom. I ran to the light switch in the living room. But again, just like the hallway, there is nothing. I walk to the kitchen and turn on the light, feeling less paranoid now. I checked the fridge but from the looks of it everything was fine, so I decided to just head to my room since my mind must surely be playing tricks on me. I head back to my room, turning the lights off as I go. I lay down in my bed and the sheer lack of sleep makes me pass out finally around 2:34.                                      
	Unfortunately, my dreams were just as unnerving. I dreamt that I was in my house, a picture-perfect replica in every detail. From the ceiling fan to the scratch on my wall from the desk I moved into not too long ago, to even the stain on my carpet from my friend who spilled soy sauce when we were eating together 2 days ago, everything was normal... except for my bedroom window that was missing. Before I could wonder why that was, I heard a loud scream from the direction of the living room. I jumped up from my bed to run toward the noise, but instead the floor crumbled underneath my weight, causing me to fall through. 
	All I could see was darkness, a kind of darkness that made my skin crawl and my body shake uncontrollably. The only thing I could see was the weird face I had seen before in my window staring down at me. His smile grew wider and wider till it seemed that his face would split in two, then his mouth opened, surging down at me. 
	I woke up screaming. It took several moments for me to calm my racing heart, to realize it had been a dream. The clock nearby read 7:28. I tried to follow my morning routine, heading straight for the shower. However, I could not shake that persistent feeling of being watched. I fixed myself some coffee. Instead of heading to work early like I always do, I felt compelled to watch the news today. Perhaps it was a result of my paranoid, stressful night. I grabbed the remote and switched on the TV. The morning news rolled, and just as I finally began to feel calm again, my heart stopped short. The very same face that I had seen in the window was staring at me in a mugshot, plastered with the headline “Look Out For This Escaped Inmate.” 
	My body immediately grew cold, my skin crawling. I quickly looked around where I was sitting, irrationally fearing that he would be right behind me. Since he was not there, I turned back and continued to listen. The newscaster goes on about how this man has been breaking into homes to kidnap kids and is sometimes even known for kidnapping adults and no one has found his victims.
	For a few minutes, I hesitated. Should I call for help? Everything seemed fine now, it was just my imagination, but I still could not forget what I thought I saw, and that ominous feeling I had. With bolstered resolve, I called 911 and quickly explained what I had experienced. The dispatcher told me to find a safe space to stay while she sent an officer to do a search, even if only for my peace of mind. She stayed on the call as I headed back toward my bathroom, ready to lock myself inside and wait. 
	It was at that moment I felt a hard object hit the back of my head, and my vision faded black.

Both were released and have got negative reviews and bombed at the box office.

Both subverted expectations. Joker FaD didn't progress the Jokers story just explored Arthur's psyche more and ended on a very sad note, and didn't give the fans what they wanted

Similarly with TP:FWWM, fans expected the cliff hanger of Cooper to be resolved and more answers given.  Instead they got a prequel about Laura Palmer and the tone was darker and leant heavily into abuse, addiction and trauma, rather than the coffee and pie familiarity of the series the fans carved. Which lead to the negative reviews 

But with FWWM, years later is lauded as a masterpiece, and one of the best films about aforementioned subjects, and is an incredible film, but a very hard watch.

Personally, Joker FaD deals with some heavy subject matters and I think the films pulls them off incredibly and effectively.

Perhaps with time it will be seen as a bold film where the filmmakers did what they wanted and explored topics not usually seen in mainstream comic book films

As I write this, another similarities is that Laura sort of Hallucinates the people from  Black Lodge, which could be seen as a way of her coping with the abuse. Arthur dreaming he's doing musical numbers to cope with him being in jail could be similar  (idk I just thought of that)",3,1734363158.0,Joker_FolieaDeux,0,1.0,False

He’s dressed in a plain black hoodie and with a North Face puffer over it, his face showing a mix of amusement and determination. The camera closes in as he begins to speak.**

***Webster: ""****Oh hey, Mark.* *Sorry, sorry, but hey, so Mark, you sat on a log, wearing a Tom Brady jersey like that means anything to a guy from me, and spilled every insecure thought you've ever had about me. I get it. You're here at the tippy top of MWE, the destroyer of dreams, the man who tears down houses. Congratulations, Mark. You’re officially a walking, talking cliché. All that smoke and mirrors just to tell me what? That you’re mad? That I’m not good enough? That I’m a fraud? I’ve heard this all before, and you’re not even creative with it.""*

***Webster:*** *""*Y*ou talk about my losses, my setbacks, and my struggles like they’re supposed to shame me. But here’s the thing, Mark: my losses? They made me. Every time I’ve fallen, I’ve gotten back up stronger. You? You hell, you can't even get the job done in any of your matches, and you probably won't admit it, but that just eats you up, huh? And that’s the difference between us. I don’t tear people down to stay on top. I rise above them. You’re not a champion, Mark. You’re a squatter sitting on top of a mountain of ashes, pretending it’s a throne.""*

***Webster:*** *""You want to talk about family, culture, and roots? That’s rich; I could talk about your little Waterline jerk parade, but let me not go that far. You claim you built the culture, but all you’ve done is poison it. You’re not inspiring anyone, Mark. You’re just another insecure gatekeeper afraid someone’s coming to take your spot. Spoiler alert: that someone is me. And let’s talk about your war stories. Great. You’ve been to battle. But you barely got by; hell, you even drew on the last night of the Netherlands tour. You’ve never faced someone like me. I’m not just here for a fight, Mark. I’m here to end your reign of terror. You think I’m just another guy on your hit list? Think again. I’m the guy who’s going to rewrite the narrative you’ve been clinging to.*

***Webster:*** *""This Total Invasion title? That belt was a symbol of everything I’ve fought for, everything I’ve earned. And soon enough, Mark, your world championship will be another symbol. Not of your dominance, but of your downfall. So keep talking, keep smirking, keep all that fake disrespect, and keep pretending you’re untouchable. Because when that bell rings, it’s not about words or narratives. It’s about who has the guts to get the job done. And Mark? That’s me. I’ll see you in the ring, champ. And when it’s over, when your legacy is lying in pieces, and look, this may come back to bite me in the ass when we get to Japan, but Mark, I want you to remember this moment. Remember how I told you exactly what was going to happen? And remember that you brought it all on yourself.""*

* **Coffee walks** ☕
* **Dinner outings to explore new cuisines** 🍣🍝🍛

A little about us:

* We both enjoy board games and video games 🎮.  I’m into crafting (crocheting, embroidering, painting, and pottery) and also love yoga and mental relaxation experiences like sound baths and singing bowls 🧘‍♀️. My boyfriend is a great cook, loves gaming, and has a knack for tech. 
* I’m a non-Dutch speaker, and my boyfriend is Dutch, so we’re happy to hang out in English or Dutch. 
* We’re childfree and live with our adorable cat 🐾. 
* We’d describe ourselves as fun and easygoing but also enjoy downtime to recharge. 
* We both love exploring different cuisines (Japanese, Indian, Italian, and more!) and are always up for new culinary adventures.  We’d love to travel around the Netherlands to discover hidden gems and cool experiences.

I don’t pay rent/mortgage, car is owned by parents and no plans to get another one, don’t pay much in bills apart from occasional groceries and regular fuel. I have a big HECS debt.

I do eat out but I’m confused about the whole ‘meal for 1 person only doesn’t count’ thing for the meal card- is this true? Would be helpful if my coffees could count to this but doesn’t seem like it.

Can I package personal scrubs as well? Or general clothes…?

Embarrassment, rejection, making mistakes, all the usual suspects, those I can recall in vivid detail, whether I want to or not. 
Happy memories, however, I struggle to feel. I just made my end of year recap, editing together all the videos of my travels this year, and I find myself watching it over and over again, grieving like it's footage of a friend who passed away. 


It's weird, but I feel that those moments of peace and joy that I find on sitting on a mountain or drinking coffee in a beautiful place are fleeting and temporary, only existing in the present that now becomes the past. I don't feel connected to the me that experienced those lovely things; she's gone.


It's like, despite living in an incredibly comfortable lifestyle- I eat every day, I sleep in a dry, climate controlled space- the daily experience of being an even remotely creative and sensitive person is inherently uncomfortable. This makes it so easy to sidestep into recalling unpleasant feelings, and difficult to displace the focus towards gratitude. 


I've tried gratitude Journaling as a practice to help with this, but it quickly becomes redundant and superficial.

Since I was a youngster, everyone has been telling me I have freak toes. They're long, and I can basically hold a cup of coffee with them. Is that something people would be interested in? Not the cup holding per se, but I think the ability to wrap them firmly around any object and hold is kind of interesting in my opinion. 

Anyone here who has experience with similar content? Is that something people would want to see and pay for?

When I interviened my husband threw me onto the coffee table and I landed on the floor. His father in a prominent retired lawyer in our city. I know from being there that his father has called my husband’s previous employer threatening him. He has used his father’s occupation for some time to scare me into compliance. My husband came back to our residence the day after he assaulted me and told me that he was going to have me arrested. He was high out of his mind. He has previous issues with drug addiction. His sister has severe psychiatric issues. She is a horrible person to top that. He sat in front of me and called his sister told her that I threatened her, which is not my normal behavior. He completely fabricated a story that I threatened her, I heard her say that she didn’t know what to do and my husband said with a grin on his face, “Call dad”. His father used his legal powers and sent three police officers to my home. They demanded that the three of us separate and they questioned each of us. I could not believe that my father in law would do this to me. My sister and I had the same story, the truth. The police made my husband leave and I knew I would be leaving. I am a wreck at this point. I have PTSD. I don’t think three cops would have shown up gunning for me if he his lawyer father had not called 911. I am not able to find a job.

I'm on the hunt for a fragrance that replicates the intense, rich aroma you experience right when you step into a coffee roastery, especially that strong, smoky scent near the roasters.

1hfldpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HerOneBag/comments/1hfldpd/5_days_in_london_in_december_and_some_lessons/,5 days in London in December- and some lessons learned,"Thanks to years of travelling by motorcycle one bagging shouldn't be too difficult for me but over the years I've crept into the realm of over packing just because I could.  I returned to some old tricks and thanks to some new ones learned here had a successful 1 bag trip and still managed to overpack!

What I packed (and comments):

2 long sleeve merino t's,  one in cream and one in black- basically lived in the black one

2 uniqlo heattech long sleeves one in grey and one in black- these were actually too hot, the weather was mild and the one day I wore the black one as a layer I ended up stripping out of it.

Tank top and Felina lounge pants for sleeping 

Cole Haan packable trench coat with removable lining- this has been the perfect coat even down to freezing temps.

Uniqlo packable down liner (doubles as a jacket)- plus it has pockets, I threw this on several times when I was running out and didn't want to wear the trench coat.  I could have gotten by without it but I was glad that I had it.

Cole Haan waterproof leather ankle boots, skechers slip ons- A last minute purchase and a lifesaver.  The boots are truly waterproof and comfortable for walking all day.  The skechers are primarily used as slippers or times when my feet need a break and I have walked all day in them without issue.

undies and socks 

Kipling crossbody- I can keep a death grip on this at all times plus I can throw it in the wash when I get home.

Large Baggu- I carry this everywhere.  Perfect size, sturdy and easy to carry.

umbrella- this was always tucked in the side slip pocket of my Kipling just in case.

Le Sport Sack packable duffle- to those that suggested locking the zippers, you are lifesavers.  I did stuff this bag for the trip home and one of the (plastic) zipper tabs broke off.  Since I had twist ties and a ribbon I was able to tie the zippers closed and the bag survived the trip through checked luggage land intact.  Thankfully the zippers themselves are sturdier than the tabs.

Spider trousers with zipped pockets- the perfect substitute for when I didn't want to wear jeans.

Toiletries- I packed single use packettes for anything that I could and tossed them when I left.

Thermos of coffee- this is my indulgence for long flights and red eyes.  I have a small Zojirushi that you can pour from without having to unscrew the whole top.  I bring it to the airport empty and get a latte post security to fill it with.  When breakfast is served on the plane I have delicious coffee at the perfect temperature for me.  It just makes me feel more human when I land. 

One the plane I wore jeans, a cotton long sleeve T, cashmere hoodie and a pair of leather Dunks.  The hoodie was used for layering the entire trip, the Dunks were my main shoes for the airports and when the weather was dry.  Also my large wool/silk scarf which doubles as a blanket and will even work as an extra layer when draped under my jacket.

I got really lucky with the weather, it was mild and I only had one day of rain.  I walked pretty much everywhere, kept dry and warm and had no issues or incidents.  If I was being picky I'd say that I could have skipped the two heattech tops and the packable down but they were still good to have, just in case of cold or spills.  I would have missed them if I had needed them!

My husband swore he didn’t want another dog, but three months later we were at the shelter.

My husband loved a hopeless case. The one dog he set his eyes on was the one I didn’t want. I couldn’t explain it, just a feeling.

He was a lab mix. Five or six. He had lost a lot of hair due to some skin condition and had milky eyes from cataracts; almost blind. The people at the shelter said he had been wandering by the creek just outside of town. 

He looked sad. His tail never wagged. There was a small window on the wall in the shelter and he wouldn’t take his eyes off of it.

My husband named him Louis.

We kept him inside. We wouldn’t let him outside unless he was on a leash and when he did go outside, he would always stare in the same direction, down at the hollow behind our house. Lots of birds and squirrels in there; we just thought he heard them. He never fought us on the leash.

Louis stayed by the back door all the time. We could pet him, but he wouldn’t stop looking out the back sliding glass door.

He was blind, but I swear he was looking at something. His mouth was always closed. He never panted. I never saw him clean himself.

He would only eat if his bowl was next to the door, but even then, between each dip into his bowl, he would look back through the window.

My husband felt some raised skin on his back, and parted the hair. A scar. My husband said it looked like writing.

He took his beard trimmer and shaved a patch of hair away from the scar tissue. There was a brand that had been burned into his skin. A weird design, like words from some kind of old that wrapped around an eye. The numbers 396 underneath it.

I wanted to take the dog back. Louis gave me the creeps, but my husband was insistent that we keep him. The dog just needed time, he said. He’d clearly been abused. He needed love.

We argued about it one night in front of Louis. I wanted him gone, but somehow my husband sweet talked me out of it. That damn dog pulled his attention away from the window and just stared at me. He stared at me through the whole argument. When it was done, he turned his attention back to the door.

Two weeks. After every day by that damn glass door staring down at the hollow, he turned away. But the dog began watching us. He still stayed by the door, but he never took his eyes off of us. Even when my husband would pet the thing, it would just stare at him with those white eyes. His eyes weren’t just following the sounds we made, I watched them move with us. My husband thought I was nuts.

When I would come down to make coffee in the morning and turn on the lights, Louis was already staring at me. I’d swear he hadn’t moved all night.

Two nights ago, Louis turned his attention back to the door. He started howling and he just wouldn’t stop.

Last night I went out with some friends. I needed a break and some quiet.

Around nine, my ring camera went off. A tall skinny man limped up to our back door and kicked it in. A long ragged black coat and a dirty frayed strip of cloth was tied around his head, covering his eyes.

I called my husband.

Nothing.

I called the cops.

Three minutes later, I saw the man amble out the back door. Louis was happily walking in front of him wagging his tail, leading the sallow man out into the dark. Louis’s muzzle was bloody.

We live a ways out of town, so it took the cops twenty minutes to get there. I had been driving back, going out of my mind, dialing my husband's number over and over. I pulled into our driveway just after the cops. We found my husband’s body in the kitchen.

His legs were broken and his throat had been torn to shreds. Bloody footprints and paw prints were all over the linoleum floor. There was something drawn on the wall next to the back door.

It was the same symbol that had been branded into Louis’s skin, but without the numbers underneath.

The police found tracks all the way down to the hollow, but then they just stopped. They’ve been searching for the last few hours with dogs.

4th date advice and questions. 

Me M35 her F 37

Both have kids both divorced 

We have been in three dates, each have seemed to have gone well. Conversations are easy, we’ve gotten onto deep topics and learned a lot about each other. But physically nothing has moved even remotely. We hug. Beginning and end of each date. But during the date there’s no physical items happening. I do not expect sex, or even a kiss although I would love one. I’ve tried to gently touch the elbow, small to back etc. I don’t feel like I’m getting a return gesture or anything lol. 

Between dates she’s very sparse on communication although she does initiate something. Every few days (I do as well). So she’s trying to some extents. I actually really kind of like that she’s not just endlessly blowing up my phone. 

Our dates so far have been :

Coffee. 2 hours

Mini road trip with lunch and exploring a city 6 hours

Late night hang out at her house 7 hours


After being invited to her home I really expected it to progress but she set a clear boundary of no sex. So I respected it and didn’t push for anything nor did I want to be weird, this was still an incredibly fun date. Lots of good convo and we played some games and what not.  After this date I was really confused. Getting mixed feelings. But she proceeded to text me a thank you for driving over snd staying so late and we swapped schedule info and planned the next date which is coming up. 

This one’s at my house. I’m going to make dinner and I have a ginger bread kit I thought would be fun for us to do but due to obligation this meetup will be quick ish so only a few hours. 

So for my question lol. Is this normal? She financially doesn’t need anything from me, meaning she is not after free dinners or something dumb like that. She has a crazy busy schedule and is making time for me, which I read as a positive. But something just feels off I guess. And I don’t know what it is. 

Second question, should I press the physical side. Once again I won’t push sex boundaries, but a kiss, more of anything? From the ladies in here what would you want me to do in this scenario? I’m not a beginner here by any means but I’m not an expert who gets tons and tons of ladies and does this all the time. I typically prefer short term -long term relationships and I will not do one night stands. 

Hope this makes sense. Any help appreciated. ",1,1734362109.0,datingoverthirty,3,1.0,False

[King Nobuyoshi Godwin: World Beyond Words](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/king-nobuyoshi-godwin-world-beyond-words/) at **5 Points Gallery**

His combined sensory experiences manifest in the scattered numbers that fill his paintings, intricately woven into the imagery, allowing him to convey emotions and ideas beyond verbal expression. For King, art is a space of renewal, where creation transcends language, offering a glimpse into his world beyond words.

This little journey has been about chasing little dreams. sometimes it feels like whats really wrong with some thoughts, together here while having this conversation this already feels like home. 

May be its a nomad’s words , sleeping where we end up chasing experiences just like a kite in the sky, recently some one had asked, if you don’t have kids what would you do when you get old. But is it really selfless love if we are expecting something in return ? Would love to hear your thoughts on this :) 

But we have a little dream to provide for as many struggling lives as possible may be thats the big dream..

Like we said there are only a few who can see both sides and appreciate all thoughts and choices , why not share it with the person who stand strong no matter what.

I got off an overnight shift and had been up for too long. I had coffee so I didn’t feel tired but judging by this, clearly I was not thinking right AT ALL

I basically was thinking an intersection with lights was a 4-way stop intersection and started pulling out into the intersection. It was just for half a second but by the time I caught myself, my front end was too far into the intersection to just stop. I believed that I didn’t have enough time to stop, put in reverse and then gun it backwards, so I just gassed it forward and crossed the road.

There was no accident, just one vehicle honking at me and they probably braked, I’m assuming. Once I was able to pull over, I went back on foot just to make sure there was no accident or anything like that.

As a boss I like to give gift cards. Starbucks, Target, Amazon. I write a little note in a card about how much I appreciate what they've done this year and throw the gift card in there. I always feel bad if they act like they have to get me something so I try to spin it as ""This is a token of my appreciation for all of your hard work"" rather than ""Here is your Christmas gift"" -- this year I have two employees and one is in another city so I gifted the local one a card to a coffee shop I know he likes and the remote employee is getting Target.

The police…. Yeah definitely not your friends or he go to people if you have a problem you’re seriously inviting a way bigger problem calling them … but hey I believed the adults that fed me that garbage and it all went so wrong for me because I refused to lie and that made them pissed just realizing huh maybe all those other times people in my life did something to me maybe my skin color had something to do with it why were my teachers so mean to the point of throwing my backpack across the classroom dumping everything out on the floor because two kids were using these sticks as sword fighting so once they dropped them on the ground I put one back where it was and asked the teacher what this is which apparently warrants them saying oh you just like to go through peoples stuff without asking huh we’re you stealing something too? How’d you like it if I went through your stuff. Q backpack dumping throwing… that was 7th grade there were others before that just from kids alone but my dumbass thought maybe they were just having a bad day idk why my teacher did that I guess I shouldn’t have touched anything even tho I was putting it back for her was fun crying Infront of the class that day and being laughed at… not until high school with the racist neighbors who were so open with their hatred for me called cops cause that Fucken adopted boy is justalways causing problems and I think he has a gun well I was into airsoft with everyone else.. they could have taken the extra 3 minutes to walk the proper way instead of back n forth through my backyard god forbid I shoot some bb’s they never saw the guns just the bb’s on the ground and just lied saying I was shooting at them I& the lovely cops who told me they could throw me off the stairs and arrest me and oooo they can tell they’re gonna be seeing a lot of me in the future…. Wasn’t until then I learned racism isn’t gone everyone’s just doing it behind my back and I was too stupid to see it wasn’t a coincidence…. That sent me spiraling 🌀 needed to find myself went backpacking hopefully a car would run me over I really didn’t want to come home I hated myself by that point I was fat always compared to my cousins god what a disappointment I always was and so stupid cause it seemed like everyone else just got things a bit faster than I did.. have always talked to girls with the notion that I can only bentheir friend even if I had a crush on them cause I heard what people would say so fat he has stretch marks on his arms ew no one told me mulatto skin was like prone to that meanwhile the fatter white kids never got them so guess t shirts are out but I lost 50lbs prior to backpacking just from hard work sand lettuce n mustard burritos so yeah I have no chance with any girl so don’t even consider that…. I guess thst helped lster in life after I ended my backpacking trip doing something dumb but I broke my back badly and my shoulder the top of it was rippped off from the muscle my back never healed right because well my bed was horrible from me being fat cuz I used food to comfort myself and my only escape was playing StarCraft, Warcraft, Diablo 2 but only barely because my computer was so shut but I didn’t complain just never realized how unfair thst makes everything my only friends were people on the games I never got along with guys cause I’d get picked on my cousin was cool till his friends would also come over and hahanso funny calling me nigger even my cuz was saying it… people seem to not understand why I am the way ii am …. The fuck is he so depressed for? I wouldn’t be if it was my choice idk I just did not enjoy my life wonder why raised by a single mother who’d say shit like where did I go so wrong with you I tried my best as if I was blaming her for something no mom you did the best you could by 4th grade I was just unhappy but like why did yal have to compare me with others I know I’m not as good as everyone else thanks for pointing it out to me I wouldn’t be me if I could…. Let’s just skip college where I met friends it was a lot better then all other schooling but even there I couldn’t get it right but also I was lucky to be walking after breaking my back the way I did i was always in pain sometimes so bad I’d just have to lay on the floor didn’t matter where I was but also I’m a drug addict cause sometimes I take pain medication welll none of you broke yourself like I did … yeshnsure but still you do drugs and that’s not right…. It was awesome when I hear one of my best friends say let’s not invite sen hes a downer and complains about pain too much (that was when I learned to stfu no one wants to hear about pain, okay….

Well I fuck up I missed my sons birth because I was having like a panic attack trying to pack my bag and make sure I had everything I needed but I had time I remember how long it took my friends baby to come ..l I miss it by like 5 minutes…. Why did I have to be me goodnight hated myself fuck I had one fucking job I was already accused of abandoning her during pregnancy causes I couldn’t be there for her like I should have been nope i was trying to make sure I could be a good father and support my kid by getting the goddamn hardest job I could have gotten a week before the birth she breaks up with me claiming I don’t care everything is f going wrong and now I just missed my sons birth … by thst much time why is life so fucking hard why do I always get it wrong life seems to work for others I grew up with n shit but never me a day late n a dollar short … i drop the fucking bag I packed with stuff for her for me snacks to take pics like I did before all I knew was I’m such a fucking loser I’m done with this shit it’s time to die…. I walked for hours but there’s no fuckingnbridge to jump to make sure I’d die a car wasn’t so assured.. look I’m done writing for now it’s just gets worse from here on out and I’m at rock bottom now and just want the world to leave me alone. Everything I loved is gone. And I’m alone and everyone hates me. Cool I hate me way more than even my mom could think I was such a disappointment… I did make her proud though for a while after smashing my moms heart into dust by becoming a felon because I had an accident and again cops are not your friends they just want to fuck you I think they tried to kill me it was a car accident…. I shoulda taken it to trial but they threatened me with 10;years see by then I was a cutter .. the pain took my mind off how much I hated myself I’m glad the scar mostly faded I wonder if I have pics it was this gnarly scar from inner elbow all the way down to wrist but I fucked that up too, only fucking thing I’m good at is not dying and I hate it. I should have died in the train accident. Why couldn’t I have died then…. Why not the car crash then and fucking missing my artery fucking hell I took a medical class I shouldn’t have Fucken that up…. 
You want to know why I don’t want to live? You have no idea the shit I’ve been through… I hate people but I really don’t I love the good ones but no one can change me not wanting to die… why am I here now? Fuck you know how many times I’ve saved my moms life? I love her, she did okay but sometimes she’s the most ungrateful can’t understand anything and I still think she’s lying to me… she never Fucken wanted me shensays I was planned bullshit no you fucked up you ran from California to here because you got knocked up by a black dude..so yeah I’m just thenfuckup that takes care of the house does computer shit laundry I used to cook when I was still a fathers and had a renewed sense on life … now I just garden clean and keeep her dumbass from dying despite her being totally sure she’d be fine without me..l. Yeah right… I do so much more than I get credit for I’m like a housewife who’s not valued for anything all I do is vacuum apparently…. Fuck me right?

I tried to follow James Hoffman’s basic recipe instruction, and it tasted pretty good. I used whole beans and ground them just before brewing, however I don’t have a dedicated coffee grinder. I have been using the small blender unit that came with my hand/stick blender, I assumed it would work just like the cheap Krupps coffee blenders, and seems to do a reasonable job. Of course, the only control you have over grind level is timing and looking at the coffee as it is ground. Is it really worth investing in a dedicated grinder? I was considering one of the KINgrinders, maybe the P2 or something like that. I’d really appreciate your opinions. ",2,1734360450.0,AeroPress,5,1.0,False

Instead of improving things as expected, all my V60 brews are tasting weaker and have less depth of flavour, along with higher acidity.

I've tried grinding finer, but that leads to unpleasant bitterness. My brew time is as expected, 2:30-3:00 for 15g coffee 250g water on a V60, so I don't think grind size is the issue.

I've tried both the recommended dosage (1 stick for 2L of water) and half (1 stick for 4L of water). It makes a difference but neither tastes particularly good.

I've tried multiple beans for reputable roasters (Assembly, Volcano in London), all get similar results.

My grinder is Niche Zero, which I'm aware is not optimal for pourover but surely can't be the reason why the coffee tastes arguably worse with Third Wave Water vs filtered tap. I’m not seeing excessive fines in the finished coffee bed.

We recently got our first espresso machine, a DeLonghi Dedica, and we're super excited to dive into the world of home espresso. My husband is especially eager to experiment and improve our coffee setup.

Here are some details about us:

* **Location:** Spain
* **Preferred drink types:** I’m more into espressos, but my husband loves lattes and occasionally flat whites.
* **Drink frequency:** We usually make 2-4 coffees a day (between the two of us).
* **Space:** Our coffee station isn’t very big, and we already have a good grinder.

I’d love to surprise him with an upgrade or accessory for Christmas. Any recommendations for must-have gear to pair with the Dedica? We're open to anything that can help us make better espresso, froth milk, or just improve the overall experience.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions! 😊",1,1734360392.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

My husband swore he didn’t want another dog, but three months later we were at the shelter.

My husband loved a hopeless case. The one dog he set his eyes on was the one I didn’t want. I couldn’t explain it, just a feeling.

He was a lab mix. Five or six. He had lost a lot of hair due to some skin condition and had milky eyes from cataracts; almost blind. The people at the shelter said he had been wandering by the creek just outside of town. 

He looked sad. His tail never wagged. There was a small window on the wall in the shelter and he wouldn’t take his eyes off of it.

My husband named him Louis.

We kept him inside. We wouldn’t let him outside unless he was on a leash. Louis stayed by the back door all the time. We could pet him, but he wouldn’t stop looking out the back sliding glass door.

He was blind, but I swear he was looking at something. His mouth was always closed. He never panted. I never saw him clean himself.

He would only eat if his bowl was next to the door, but even then, between each dip into his bowl, he would look back through the window.

My husband felt some raised skin on his back, and parted the hair. A scar. My husband said it looked like writing.

He took his beard trimmer and shaved a patch of hair away from the scar tissue. There was a brand that had been burned into his skin. A weird design with the numbers 396 underneath it.

I wanted to take the dog back. Louis gave me the creeps, but my husband was insistent that we keep him. The dog just needed time, he said. He needed love.

Two weeks. Everyday by that damn glass door. But the dog began watching us. Even when my husband would pet the thing, it would just stare at him with those white eyes. When I would come down to make coffee in the morning and turn on the lights, Louis was already staring at me. I’d swear he hadn’t moved all night.

Two nights ago, Louis started howling and he just wouldn’t stop.

Last night I went out with some friends. I needed a break and some quiet.

Around nine, my ring camera went off. A tall skinny man limped up to our back door and kicked it in. A long ragged black coat and a dirty frayed strip of cloth was tied around his head, covering his eyes.

I called my husband.

Nothing.

I called the cops.

Three minutes later, I saw the man amble out the back door. Louis was happily walking in front of him wagging his tail, leading the sallow man out into the dark. Louis’s muzzle was bloody.

My husband’s body was found in the kitchen.

His legs were broken and his throat had been torn to shreds.

I wanted to take the dog back. Louis gave me the creeps, but my husband was insistent that we keep him. The dog just needed time, he said. He’d clearly been abused. He needed love.

We argued about it one night in front of Louis. I wanted him gone, but somehow my husband sweet talked me out of it. That damn dog pulled his attention away from the window and just stared at me. He stared at me through the whole argument. When it was done, he turned his attention back to the door.

Two weeks. After every day by that damn glass door staring down at the hollow, he turned away. But the dog began watching us. He still stayed by the door, but he never took his eyes off of us. Even when my husband would pet the thing, it would just stare at him with those white eyes. His eyes weren’t just following the sounds we made, I watched them move with us. My husband thought I was nuts.

Three minutes later, I saw the man amble out the back door. Louis was happily walking in front of him wagging his tail, leading the sallow man out into the dark. Louis’s muzzle was bloody.

We live a ways out of town, so it took the cops twenty minutes to get there. I had been driving back, going out of my mind, dialing my husband's number over and over. I pulled into our driveway just after the cops. We found my husband’s body in the kitchen.

His legs were broken and his throat had been torn to shreds. Bloody footprints and paw prints were all over the linoleum floor. There was something drawn on the wall next to the back door.

It was the same symbol that had been branded into Louis’s skin, but without the numbers underneath.

The police found tracks all the way down to the hollow, but then they just stopped. They’ve been searching for the last few hours with dogs.

Nothing.

Sometimes I feel like if I act tired or do something differently from my routine, my partner is secretly concerned I’m drinking, when I’m not. Like, I mentioned how I might take a nap today and then I had coffee and he acted all confused and asked if I was okay.

1hfkgg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoDicey/comments/1hfkgg2/best_bitcoin_casinos_ive_actually_played/,Best Bitcoin Casinos I've Actually Played,"Been testing a bunch of Bitcoin casinos lately (perks of being a former dev - I get to ""research"" slots for a living lol). After dropping way too much BTC across different platforms, thought I'd share my actual experiences, not just some copy-paste review garbage.

Cloudbet's been my main spot lately. Been around since 2013 which is like ancient in crypto years. Their game selection is actually insane - we're talking everything from my old Pragmatic stuff to NetEnt classics. What really got me though was their withdrawal speed. Hit a nice win on Book of Dead last week, and the BTC was in my wallet faster than I could finish my coffee.

Thunderpick's another solid one I've been grinding. Their crypto integration is smooth as butter - none of that clunky conversion stuff some sites do. Plus they've got this sweet esports betting section (yeah, I might've lost some ETH betting on CS matches... don't judge). One thing that sets them apart is their mobile setup - actually works properly on phone, which is rare for crypto casinos.

Jackbit's been surprisingly good too, despite being newer. Their game selection rivals the big boys - saw a bunch of games I helped develop back in the day. Only annoying thing is they advertise as ""no KYC"" but still ask for docs on bigger withdrawals. But hey, at least their support team isn't completely useless when you need them.

Pro tip from someone who's been burned before - always check the licenses. Like, Cloudbet and Thunderpick have actual Curacao licenses (yeah I know, not Malta, but still better than nothing). And ALWAYS test the withdrawal system with a small amount first. Can't tell you how many times I've seen people dump big money in before checking if they can actually get it out.

For you technical nerds out there (like myself), pay attention to the blockchain fees too. Some places cover them, others don't. And watch those internal wallet conversions - some casinos do weird stuff with exchange rates that can eat into your profits...

work really affects my depressive symptoms. a lot of the time it’s been hard to get myself up before/after my shift and do important personal things like cleaning. i find myself crocheting a lot at home— it’s my only hobby that hasn’t been swallowed up by my depression and self doubt. but it allows me to stagnate. my social anxiety is constantly pretty high, because 90% of my jobs have heavily involved customer service. almost everything on my experience level in my area is customer service.

i’ve applied to probably close to 50 jobs this year. i’m on my 4th job of the year. i started off the year with one i had been at for a year, but after last christmas, i couldn’t take it anymore. i relapsed sh because of that job. i went to a coffee shop which ended up being shitty, and got a seasonal job after a few months. the owner royally fucked me over in terms of taxes, but is “promising” to help me pay them.

so now i’m at my 4th job of the year, at another restaurant where i’m constantly interacting with people, not getting full time, getting less hours. it could be worse; i actually just rejected a job that was way worse. i feel like a failure for not finding something better, though. i know this system is broken, it’s not meant to sustain people like me. but i can’t help but think i’m a failure for not putting up with the shit that other people put up with, for not finding something i can save more money with. i feel like a failure for not calling more companies back, asking them to review my resume again. i’m trying to move closer to my boyfriend within the next 6 months. i was only going to stay at this new job until then, so i can have some pay stubs and a bit more saved, but it’s going to make my resume so much worse than it already is. i need to get out of my situation right now, but how can i even save for a house of our own when im spending 60% of my paycheck on rent? how can i get a better paying job when we’re living together so it’s not all on his shoulders?

i just wanna lay down and do nothing. i have barely any energy. i don’t want to go to the second shift at my new job later. my sh urges are off the charts. i don’t have therapy until wednesday. everything is so hard rn. thank you for reading.",3,1734359154.0,BPD,1,1.0,False

Looks like we have a reversal in place on the 4hr chart.. fingers crossed we get some good volume to give us a really good push. Volume has been pretty weak over the weekend.

MACD is rounding to bottom.. the red bars have not turned light red yet to indicate a bottom on the rounding of the bottom. I believe it's close. Likely we get some positive momentum that turns us up.

STOCHASTIC RSI has bounced off the bottom of oversold. The current 4hr candle stick is green so with a bit more push it should complete the crossover and give us a buy signal. Currently xrp is in oversold territory need it to cross over the 20 spot for a good confirmation of the reversal. Currently 10.97 and 10.32 are the indicator line positions.. nearly crossed over upside but not quite.

DAILY CHART summary still stands from yesterday. We are oversold on daily too and once the upside kicks in we should have several days of upwards momentum and send the stochastic rsi to overbought.

Overall... it looks like we have reversed off a bottom while I slept. I think we will get some more bullish momentum thanks to BTC giving us a new high.

2.55 is still our ceiling resistance.. gotta break it.

1hfk3lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/petlongevity/comments/1hfk3lg/foods_that_are_toxic_or_harmful_to_dogs/,Foods that are toxic or harmful to dogs,"Here’s a list of foods that are harmful or toxic to dogs, along with brief explanations of why they should be avoided:

**1. Chocolate**

Contains theobromine and caffeine, which are toxic to dogs and can cause vomiting, diarrhea, rapid heart rate, seizures, and even death. Dark chocolate is particularly dangerous. After one too many expensive trips to the vet, I no longer keep it in the house.

**2. Grapes and Raisins**

Can cause kidney failure in dogs, even in small amounts.

**3. Onions and Garlic**

Contain compounds that can damage red blood cells, leading to anemia.

**4. Xylitol (Artificial Sweetener)**

Found in sugar-free gum, candies, and baked goods; causes a rapid insulin release, leading to hypoglycemia and liver failure. BEWARE, EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! Not all foods have warnings for this ingredient so beware any diet or ""low carb"" baked goods or treats.

**5. Alcohol**

Even small amounts can cause vomiting, diarrhea, breathing issues, coma, or death.

**6. Avocado**

Contains persin, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea, though toxicity is generally mild for dogs.

**7. Macadamia Nuts**

Can cause weakness, vomiting, tremors, and hyperthermia.

**8. Caffeine (Coffee, Tea, Energy Drinks)**

Contains methylxanthines, which are toxic and can cause restlessness, rapid breathing, and heart issues.

**9. Raw Yeast Dough**

Expands in the stomach and can cause bloating, pain, and potential stomach rupture. Yeast also produces alcohol during fermentation.

10. Cooked Bones

Can splinter and cause choking or damage to the digestive tract.

**11. Fatty or Fried Foods**

Can lead to pancreatitis, which causes severe abdominal pain and digestive issues.

**12. Raw Eggs, Meat, or Fish**

May contain bacteria like Salmonella or E. coli, and raw fish can cause a deficiency in thiamine, leading to neurological issues.

**13. Salt (in excess)**

Too much salt can cause sodium ion poisoning, leading to vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, or seizures.

**14. Dairy Products**

Many dogs are lactose intolerant and may experience digestive upset.

**15. Citrus Fruits**

High amounts can cause stomach upset, and citrus oils can be toxic.

**16. Nutmeg**

Contains myristicin, which can cause tremors, seizures, and nervous system issues.

**17. Mushrooms**

Certain wild mushrooms are highly toxic and can cause severe reactions, including organ failure.

**18. Cherries**

The pits, stems, and leaves contain cyanide, which is toxic to dogs.

**19. Apple Seeds**

Also contain cyanide and should be avoided, though the flesh of the apple is safe.

**20. Corn on the Cob**

While corn itself is fine, the cob can cause choking or intestinal blockages.

**21. Foods that can be a choke hazard**

Also, beware foods that can easily become a choke hazard. For example, marshmallows, large pieces of meat that your dog might try to swallow in a single bite, gristly or chewy cuts of meat, like chicken hearts. 

**22. Nonfoods like toy stuffing.**

**23. Peanut butter**

Dogs are very sensitive to the mycotoxins that can be present in small amounts.

If you're ever unsure about a specific food, consult your veterinarian before offering it to your dog.
