1l7zoit,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/1l7zoit/31f_making_space_for_new_friendships/,[31/F] Making space for new friendships,"Hello!

I've previously posted in another pen pal sub and got a fair amount of email exchanges at first. Eventually, the numbers have narrowed down. I realized that while it was good while it lasted, what I'm truly seeking are potential long-term friendships‚ÄîI've had some falling out with my old friends and I wish to make a new one sprout. I'm posting here in the hopes of having newfound pals!

While I'm an introverted person, I'm intentional when making friends. Quality over quantity anytime. With that said, I am embracing long emails veiled with photos, memes, or anything you want to talk about. We can share points of view, rant about something and anything, and celebrate even the smallest and most personal of events. I'll send you a birthday greeting (hopefully also a greeting card to your mailbox in the future), probably check on your siblings or parents or pets as if they know me‚ÄîI'll be that friend who's there for you!

But before all of that...who am I?

I'm an Asian female from the Philippines. I currently sport a pixie haircut because the weather in my country is terribly hot and humid. Reading books is one of my hobbies (although it's an off and on thing), but I also delve into CD collection. I love music and I'll likely ask you what genre you're currently into. Coffee? Hell yeah. I drink one every day. I love learning about culture and society, as well as philosophy (I'm trying but I'm still a noob). Also, I love dogs and cats, but I can't adopt pets at the moment because of my apartment's terms. I dreamed of being a writer or a lawyer, but I kept these dreams only dreams. I'm not yet sure if I'll be back to my former profession, teaching, or if I'd try social work. I'm also in a committed relationship and my boyfriend introduced me to several video games (we're currently playing Baldur's Gate 3). 

Sadly, I can only do email exchanges at the moment. We can discuss how frequent our conversations could be, but I reply pretty quickly (since I also try to get out of my head and I enjoy talking in emails). I would just like to request that in case you don't feel like continuing to write with me anymore, please send me an email and do let me know. It would be sad but I'd prefer that over ghosting.

I welcome all genders, as long as you feel you can commit to making a friendship grow. Age does not matter for me, as long as you're in legal age and do not lie about it. I'd like to reiterate that I'm in a committed relationship, so I'm not the person to be sought romantic connections with.

Please message me if you think we'd be good friends :) See you and *maraming salamat* (thank you very much)!",1,1749564532.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

1l7zmgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1l7zmgw/when_a_mug_is_the_hero_of_the_story/,When a mug is the hero of the story,"I have been waiting 20 years to tell this story. Yours are the first eyeballs to read it. Not even my best friend knows. By way of background: I am the nicest, politest, most ordinary-looking person you will ever meet. I am also a Scorpio (not by choice), and this will factor into the story.

In the mid-aughts, I worked as a paralegal at a law firm. I had a case involving a male plaintiff who was fired after getting caught having sex on the job. The plot twist: it was he and his boyfriend. For purposes of this story, I‚Äôll call him Greedy. So he sued our client, the employer, claiming wrongful termination based on his sexual orientation. In reality, he was fired for documented, repeated job performance issues, and this event was the final straw for the employer.

The case proceeded to a voluntary (not court-ordered) mediation, which took place in our all-glass-walled conference room. During the proceedings, my boss called me to come to the conference room. He met me outside of the room and told me this.

Greedy was willing to settle for X amount of money‚Ä¶and a mug. During the mediation, he told my boss that he has a personal practice of suing all of his employers for sexual orientation discrimination, and with those employers, he did the same thing: settled for money and a mug. But the mug had to be from the employer‚Äôs law firm, preferably with the firm‚Äôs name on it. They were his souvenirs, his trophies.

My boss happened to be gay, so he was particularly grossed out by this request. I happen to be a lifelong ally - I have gay, trans and NB family members - so I too was gritting my teeth. My boss asked me very gently to bring this plaintiff a cup of coffee in one of our logo mugs. 

So I went to the kitchen, pulled a clean mug out of the cabinet, filled it with coffee and then just stood and stared at it. I thought about this new information that the plaintiff has a pattern and practice of suing employers over bogus claims of sexual orientation discrimination just because he can. I thought of all the hours I‚Äôd worked on his case, knowing full well the client did not remotely discriminate against him, and here we were, giving him money and a mug like the prior employers did. I thought of all the people out in the world being mistreated or fired for their sexual orientation and how they are suffering, and most can‚Äôt afford an attorney. I took 5 minutes to stew about it internally, reminded myself that I‚Äôm A Professional, sighed, and walked from the kitchen to the conference room holding the mug and its coffee. En route, I passed by the ladies room. I stopped and realized I had to pee. 

Then it clicked.

Dear readers, I did it.

I went into the ladies room, made sure it was empty, poured the coffee into the sink, went into a stall, peed a little into the mug, peed the rest into the toilet, washed my hands, exited, walked back to the kitchen, filled the mug with coffee again, and slowly walked it over to the conference room. I went in and placed the mug on a coaster in front of Greedy.

‚ÄúLet me know if the coffee‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I said to him sweetly. Greedy sipped it and approved. My boss thanked me and I gave him a big, wide, Cheshire cat smile. I quietly left, walked back to the ladies room, did a little happy dance, returned to my professional demeanor, went back to my office and starting drafting the settlement agreement. 

That‚Äôs the story. Let the downvoting fiesta begin! Even though I really did it. And now it‚Äôs off my chest.

Did I comply maliciously with Greedy‚Äôs mug request in order to get the case resolved? Sure did. üí¶",2,1749564380.0,MaliciousCompliance,0,0.63,False

1l7zl1u,https://i.redd.it/nhkfzwzmw36f1.jpeg,Review #3: Dalmore Luminary No. 2,"**Distillery:** The Dalmore

**Age Statement:** 16 years

**ABV:** 48.6%

**Cask type:** Ex-bourbon, finished in Apostoles sherry and Tawny port, with a small amount of peated malt

**Color:** [0.6 or 0.7 (old gold)](https://maltrunners.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cil8ins.jpeg)

**Price:** $300

After quite a while collecting whisky, I‚Äôve started to appreciate that different bottles fill different niches in a collection. Some are staples, drams you can have on any given day‚Äìan Ardbeg 10 for peaty whisky fans, for instance‚Äìwhile others are under-the-radar, ‚Äúif you know, you know‚Äù picks‚Äìlike a Gordon & MacPhail Speymalt Macallan. Finally, some bottles are worthy bar centerpieces, notable for their display value as much as the quality of the juice inside.

Dalmore‚Äôs Luminary series probably slots into that final category. This line of three annual releases, concluding this year with the Luminary No. 3, honors architects or creatives, while also showcasing a unique element in Dalmore‚Äôs vast and varied stocks. The Luminary No. 2‚Äôs inspiration was architect Melodie Leung, who designed the box and thus gets her very winsome portrait on the inside panel. And the unique twist of Luminary No. 2, released last year, is that it features some peated Dalmore, a rarity from this distillery.

Anyways, I doubt anyone would argue that the bottle doesn‚Äôt look great, but how does it taste?

**Nose:** This is not your daddy‚Äôs Dalmore, folks. Although there‚Äôs only a bit of peat in the mix, it definitely shapes and savors up this whisky‚Äôs scent profile. My first impression was burnt cookie bottoms and a hint of heathery peat. Over time, the nose got sweeter and fruitier, turning toward apricots, vanilla, rum raisin ice cream, and that familiar Dalmore orange.

**Palate:** The most notable feature of my first sip was the velvet-like texture, mouthcoating without feeling waxy. The nose was more complex and interesting than the palate, which is pleasant but not earth-shattering: some sherry spice, rum raisins, and stewed fruit or orange marmalade. Once again, the peat emerged as an earthy, sooty element late in the game.

**Finish:** Peated whiskies tend to have a great finish, and this one was no exception. The finish fused that unusual peat, which leaned toward an earthier, coffee flavor, with tangerines, cloves, and spearmint. Started strong, finished strong.¬†

**Conclusion:** I was between a 6 and a 7 on this one, but rounded up because it is always fascinating to try a distillery‚Äôs first modern foray into peated whisky. Around seven or eight years ago, Balvenie did something similar when they released their 14-year-old Peat Week (since renamed the Week of Peat), and I also jumped on that bottle, albeit at a much more reasonable $100. Ah, to be back in the price environment of the 2010s. I‚Äôm glad I tried this Dalmore but, to be honest, it is tough to figure out who is the perfect audience or target buyer. It‚Äôs not truly for Islay whisky fans or peatheads because the peat is very light, as light as in an Oban. And it may be a strange detour for someone who‚Äôs an ardent fan of Dalmore‚Äôs orange-and-coffee, liqueur-like flavor profile. Overall, especially given its price, this really seems more like a collectible item for the whisky fan who‚Äôs tried a lot and is on the hunt for novelty.

I have to go to work for only 5 hours, and I'm scared I'll have to go again (it's a small bathroom in the middle of everything, so don't want to use that for number 2 if at all possible, but I also don't want to make weird noises the rest of the shift).

I think I need to go like 4 times a day.  I could hold it, but it's hard and it makes a lot of noise. 

I thought maybe I was just overeating, but I severely cut back, like half the calories I used to have, and I think it's actually gotten worse.  

Do some people just have a schedule like that, or is this a sign something's wrong?  I do have 28 ounces of coffee a day, so that might be a factor.  But that's what I used to do back when I only went twice a day, too.

The place was full, no other spots. The barista asked him to move, but he refused, saying he got there first, which wasn‚Äôt true.

I noticed he had a fancy briefcase and planner open, looked like he was prepping for a meeting. Then I overheard him on the phone talking about a client meeting downtown soon.

So I used the caf√©‚Äôs app,  they let regulars reserve tables. I reserved my own table (the one he was using) for 15 minutes later, knowing he‚Äôd have to leave.

Sure enough, the barista told him he had to move. He packed up and left, grumbling about disrespectful kids.

I got my table back, finished my work, and even got a free pastry from the barista who was lowkey amused.",2,1749563907.0,EntitledPeople,0,0.6,False

Somente depois de chegar √† minha casa fui observar que o prazo de validade finda em 23/07/25, eis o motivo do desconto. Eu pretendia usar somente quando estivesse com pouca disposi√ß√£o, mas agora vou ter que consumir com maior frequ√™ncia. E se passar da validade eu n√£o vejo problema em usar at√© agosto, um m√™s depois do prazo de validade determinado pelo fabricante, no m√°ximo o efeito vai ser menor do que o esperado.

Comprei tamb√©m um sach√™ de Ultra Coffe por R$ 6,59 e ontem chegou uma embalagem de suplementos de cafe√≠na da Dux, que comprei na Amazon.

O melhor custo benef√≠cio parece ser a cafe√≠na da Dux, em c√°psulas. Cada c√°psula tem 200 mg de cafe√≠na e custou cerca de R$ 1 cada. Em segundo lugar, o Pr√© Treino da Max Titaniun, que cont√©m 150 mg de cafe√≠na, 2 g de beta alanina, entre outras coisas, e custou cerca de R$ 1,40 por dose ( 36 por√ß√µes ao total). Por √∫ltimo, o ultra Cofee tem apenas 100 mg de cafe√≠na, 800mg de Taurina e tem uma dose √∫nica, que custou R$ 6,59.

Voc√™s fazem uso de pr√© treino ou acham que isso faz parte da ‚Äúgourmetiza√ß√£o da muscula√ß√£o‚Äù ?

1l7zdzg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7zdzg,Day 17/60- Birthday edit,"Howdy, Labutis, Selam, Heisann folkens, whichever flavor you fancy, take your pick!  
  
Just wanted to drop a little b-day update (it was yesterday actually, but who's counting when you're leveling up in life?). As of this glorious morning, I‚Äôm sitting at¬†107.5kg/237lbs, down from ¬†120kg/264.6lbs. Progress illustrations included ‚Äì in both scales for my dear fellow fasters.  
  
Coming to my routine, I've almost strictly stuck with my plan, except for adding a tiny bit of sugar for my black coffee every now and then, which I believe has a negligible effect. I drink green tea as well, but with no sugar. I'm taking my supplements every day without skipping. Some of them are very thick so I almost feel choking if I were to swallow more than one in time haha! Walking has become my bestie. I‚Äôve noticed that for every solid hour I hit the pavement, I earn myself a 100g weight loss bonus after my standard hour-long walk. Not bad, right? I don‚Äôt really¬†do¬†sedentary days‚Äìunless it‚Äôs storming or I‚Äôm sick, you won‚Äôt catch me glued to the couch, so I don't know how much I could've lost if I didn't move. I‚Äôm healthy, I‚Äôve got legs, and I‚Äôm using them.

I‚Äôm fully aware‚Äìthis isn‚Äôt the finish line. I‚Äôm not even halfway there. I don‚Äôt count this as an improvement until I crush that¬†100kg/220lb¬†wall (not the end goal, just a major checkpoint). I've touched it before, and I know that final 10kg/22lbs is going to be a beast. But hey, Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day, and neither is a new body.

When I started this journey, I remember thinking:¬†""Dear God, how on earth will these days pass?*""*¬†But guess what? They do. One day at a time. And every morning, I wake up a little closer. In my language, we say¬†*‚Äú*to drink the hemlock poison*‚Äù*. It means enduring the tough stuff now for a better tomorrow. It‚Äôs sacrifice. It‚Äôs commitment. And yes, it kinda sucks sometimes. But it‚Äôs worth it.

I‚Äôm not naive‚ÄìI know the real challenge is the post-fast phase. I‚Äôve got a few strategies lined up, but if you‚Äôve been down this road and lived to tell the tale,¬†drop me a comment or a message. I‚Äôd seriously appreciate your insights as I sketch out my roadmap.

My 30s are calling ‚Äì and I‚Äôm showing up with a new body, a sharper mind, and a fired-up soul.  
I‚Äôm coming big in passion and small in waistline.

1l7zdv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1l7zdv9/my_wife_hates_my_family_but_expects_me_to_love/,My Wife Hates my Family but expects me to love her family,"My wife and I got married two months ago.  
There was never a major problem between us. We've never argued.  
The only problem we had in our history was the parents.

Not to go into too much detail now:  
My mother is very self-confident and dominant and likes to speak plainly. Sometimes too direct.  
Her mother is a dainty little mouse. Very quiet, very reserved but talks a lot.  
The fathers have always got along well so far and have always ironed out any inconsistencies between the mothers.

When we were engaged, my mother-in-law never wanted to let my wife get too close to us.  
While I went there several times with an open heart and really tried to have a deep connection with my parents-in-law (which I succeeded in doing), my wife was always very reserved towards my parents.  
She never liked to come unaccompanied at first, be it her parents or her little sister.  
They always said she was shy and needed time, which my parents respected.  


My parents are generally very relaxed when it comes to things like that. Without really making demands.  
Then the day came when our mothers had a fight.  
My mother in law is trying to set the tone in the marriage process subliminally and insulting my mother passive aggresively and my mother then shouted at her on the phone and tried to put her in her place.  
My mother-in-law then collapsed next to my wife, which sparked off a huge argument.  
My mother was then declared the enemy.  
Her mother, who was very hurt, cried and said she didn't want to have anything more to do with my mother.

**After the shit hit the fan, my wife also decided to turn her back on my mother.**  
No messages, no phone calls, nothing.  
Before that it was already very lean, but after that it was completely dead.

I understood your frustration and took my mother to task.  
Even if she has valid points to lash out, she always has to control her emotions.  
Ive told her things like:  
""They're very sensitive""  
""You're destroying my marriage""  
""Why don't you think of me""

I really took sides with my Parents in Law/Wife in this.

My father and me tried to settle things out at first by going to their house allone.  
We apologized on behalf of my mother and went to my parents-in-law together to straighten things out.

My father, who is 10 years older than all the parents in the story, swallowed his pride and apologized to them in name of my mother who they did not want to attend at first.

After a few weeks, as the weddings approached, there was a talk.  
**They all spoke out and my mother remarked that there can always be differences between the parents, but as children in this marriage you don't have to make the parents' problems your own.**

After this story, things calmed down a bit and the mothers and my wife had contact from time to time. But it was kept to a minimum.  
My wife still never really tried to bond with my mother, this time with the excuse that the story had left scars.

**Now to my father:**  
My father generally always said yes to everything.  
He made everything possible for us.  
She wanted a gold set, which was more expensive than he could afford.  
Nevertheless, he said yes to 8500‚Ç¨ instead of 6000‚Ç¨.  
She wanted the expensive invitation cards for 400‚Ç¨ instead of 200‚Ç¨ - he said yes.  
He paid ‚Ç¨15,000 for the wedding hall rent and ‚Ç¨15,000 for the furniture of our first apartement.  
He also paid the rent of 3000‚Ç¨ for 3 months before we moved in.

Now the wedding was coming up and everything seemed to be going well.  
Traditionally, money is given to the bride and groom at this wedding.  
My father had promised us not to take this money.  
  
Normally the parents go to weddings for years and gift money to groom and bride.  
For example 100‚Ç¨ for the son of one of their cousins, 200‚Ç¨ for their newphew and so on.  
  
The money comes back when one of your children gets married.  
Parents then deduct the hall rent from the money and give the rest to the children.  
USUALLY.

Nevertheless, my father said to me, ‚ÄúMy son keep the money, I'll pay for it‚Äù  
The wedding was fine and dandy and then we went on our honeymoon.  
I was very happy about that moment because I thought there would be no more friction.  
Wedding planning is generally always stressful and after the wedding you just meet up for coffee here and there.  
  
After the honeymoon  we sat together with the parents for the first time in a long time and there was no friction.  
I was very surprised by this.  
Meanwhile, everything seemed to be getting better then the shock:

The part where the money is given to us on it was filmed, of course.  
My father got the wedding DVD and gave it to me.  
At home, I noticed that ‚Ç¨3000 was missing and so did my wife.  
I was angry and so was she.  
I was rather disappointed that my father kept it from me and my wife was simply mad because she thought we were entitled to the money.  
I said that my father had paid more than enough.   
Fuck the 3000‚Ç¨ euro. It was about the principle.  
My father-in-law, who was given the money after the wedding to put it aside till we come back, asked my father himself several times why something was missing and my father never spoke openly.  
That was apparently his biggest mistake.

After my father-in-law found out about the missing money, he confronted my father on the phone and they had a huge argument.  
My father said I paid everything and you're stressing about ‚Ç¨3000.  
Father-in-law says you should have told me.  
Both of them are getting worked up and blaming each other. I did this and I did that.  
My father-in-law says you didn't even get my daughter bridal shoes.  
That triggered my father so hard that he said we'd talk in person next time.

I then invited both fathers to my wife's and my apartment in the hope of solving the problem.  
So they both came and my father had a notepad with him.  
He says "" I'm not going to be told that I didn't even get bridal shoes. You're going to listen to everything"" and then listed all the costs.  
In the end it was around ‚Ç¨70-80,000.  
He then said, aren't you ashamed to ask about 3000‚Ç¨?  
Aren't you ashamed to come to me with some bridal shoes?

He then approached my wife and said, ""My son got you something for ‚Ç¨500 for your birthday. You only got him a T-shirt.  
Then she cried.

My father was very hurt at that moment and also got louder.  
He then got up and left.

After my father in law left, my wife started crying and screaming ""i will never let your father again in my house and i dont will go to them""  
Now to the main problem:

2 weeks have passed since then.  
My parents still say we would like to love her but she won't let us.  
She deletes us directly from her life when something doesn't fit.  
We have done so much for you both.  
  
My wife expects me to be cold to my father and to keep in good contact with your parents.  
I, on the other hand, am in favor of peace and tell her: ""Baby, as long as there is no peace, it will always be chaotic. You shouldn't always boycott my family every time there's a conflict.  
She sees it differently and has no empathy for me in this situation.  
Of course, her mother pushes her a bit and keeps saying ""well then you don't have any parents-in-law anymore, be happy""  
**It should be noted that she was always oppressed by her own mother-in-law back then.**



End of the story, my wife doesn't want to have anything to do with my side anymore and it's eating me up to show up alone everywhere, but now she hopes that I will have close contact with her parents again.I said that I think it's unfair and that she has everything she wants and I don't and she says:  
""your father was disrespectful""  
""he has become louder""  
""that was our money""

I say but he paid so much for us and he was just hurt.  
She says ""never mind, it's the principle"".

This beef between the families kills me and so does her lack of empathy.

As soon as my father calls me, she gets in a bad mood.

‚ÄúShe says I should make him feel that he's done the wrong thing‚Äù  
Now I ask myself the question, so that I feel a little more understanding, whether I should also boycott her parents?  
Just so she realizes what it's like?  
Her parents have always been good to me, even though I think her mother is a mastermind in many things.  
I just have the feeling that I won't get anywhere else because of her stubbornness.

I would never turn my back on your parents in such matters just for her sake.  
I have the feeling that she doesn't give a shit about my feelings.

## Key Features Analysis

The best coffee maker water filters offer a combination of effective filtration, user-friendly design, and long-lasting performance.

**Filtration Technology:** The effectiveness of a water filter hinges on its filtration technology. Look for filters that utilize activated carbon, as this material is highly effective at removing chlorine, odors, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from water. Some filters also incorporate ion-exchange resins to further reduce mineral content and improve water softness.

the activated carbon filtration process involves water passing through a bed of carbon granules.These granules have a vast surface area that attracts and traps impurities through adsorption. ion-exchange resins, on the other hand, swap undesirable ions (like calcium and magnesium) with more desirable ones (like sodium or hydrogen), softening the water and preventing mineral buildup in your coffee maker.

**Filter Material:** The quality of the filter material directly affects its lifespan and performance. High-quality activated carbon filters are typically made from coconut shells or other natural sources, offering superior filtration compared to cheaper alternatives. The housing of the filter should also be made from food-grade, BPA-free plastic to ensure the water remains safe and uncontaminated.Choosing a filter with a durable and well-constructed housing prevents leaks and ensures the filter remains intact throughout its lifespan. The use of food-grade, BPA-free plastic guarantees that no harmful chemicals leach into the water during the filtration process, preserving the purity of your coffee.

**Filter Lifespan:** Knowing the filter's lifespan is crucial for budgeting and maintenance. Most coffee maker water filters are designed to last for approximately 60 days or 60 brewing cycles, depending on the brand and model. Some filters may offer a longer lifespan, but it's essential to replace them regularly to maintain optimal water quality and prevent the buildup of bacteria.

Regularly replacing your water filter ensures that it effectively removes impurities from your water, preventing scale buildup in your coffee maker and maintaining the optimal flavor of your coffee.Ignoring the filter's lifespan can led to reduced filtration performance and perhaps effect the lifespan of your coffee maker.

**Compatibility:** Ensure the water filter is compatible with your specific coffee maker model. While some filters are designed as worldwide replacements, others are specifically made for certain brands or models. Check the product specifications or consult your coffee maker's user manual to confirm compatibility before purchasing a filter.

Using a filter that is not designed for your coffee maker can lead to improper fit, reduced filtration efficiency, or even damage to your machine. Always verify compatibility to ensure seamless integration and optimal performance.

**Installation and Replacement:** A user-friendly design makes filter installation and replacement rapid and easy.Look for filters that are simple to insert and remove without requiring special tools or complicated procedures.Some filters feature a push-and-lock mechanism for added convenience and security.A simple installation process minimizes downtime and allows you to quickly replace the filter without any hassle. A secure locking mechanism ensures the filter stays firmly in place during brewing, preventing leaks and maintaining consistent filtration.

## core Benefits

Using a coffee maker water filter provides several key benefits that enhance your coffee experience.

**Improved Coffee taste:** By removing chlorine, minerals, and other impurities from your water, a water filter significantly improves the taste of your coffee. You'll notice a cleaner, smoother, and more flavorful cup with enhanced aroma and a more balanced taste profile.

Hard water can result in bitter coffee. A water filter removes impurities that compromise the taste of coffee, letting the nuanced flavor profile shine through.

**Extended Coffee Maker Lifespan:** Filtered water prevents mineral buildup and scale formation in your coffee maker, extending its lifespan and reducing the need for frequent cleaning. Scale buildup can clog the water lines and heating elements, leading to reduced performance and potential damage.

Using filtered water reduces the likelihood of scale formation, protecting the internal components of your coffee maker and ensuring it operates efficiently for longer. Reducing the frequency of descaling maintenance translates to time and cost savings.

**Healthier Coffee Consumption:** Filtering water removes harmful contaminants, ensuring you consume a healthier cup of coffee. Chlorine, heavy metals, and other chemicals can have adverse health effects, so using a water filter provides peace of mind.

by removing potentially harmful substances from your water, a water filter contributes to a healthier lifestyle by delivering purer coffee.**Consistent Coffee Quality:** Water quality can vary depending on your location and source. Using a water filter ensures consistent water quality and, therefore, consistent coffee quality irrespective of where you are, leading to a reliable and enjoyable brewing experience every time.Seasonal and regional variations in water quality can affect how coffee is brewed, but with a quality filter, the taste will be consistent.

## FAQs Section

**Are coffee maker water filters universal, or do I need a specific type for my machine?**

Most coffee maker water filters are designed to last for approximately 60 days or 60 brewing cycles, depending on the brand and model. Regularly replacing your filter ensures optimal water quality, prevents scale buildup, and maintains the flavor of your coffee.

**Can I reuse a coffee maker water filter?**
No, coffee maker water filters are not designed for reuse. once the filter has reached its lifespan, it becomes less effective at removing impurities and may even harbor bacteria. Reusing a filter can compromise the quality of your coffee and potentially damage your coffee maker.

**What are the benefits of using filtered water in my coffee maker?**
Using filtered water in your coffee maker offers several benefits, including improved coffee taste, extended coffee maker lifespan, healthier coffee consumption, and consistent coffee quality. Filtered water removes chlorine,minerals,and other impurities that can negatively impact the flavor of your coffee and contribute to scale buildup in your machine.

But coffee? It has a rich and fascinating story that deserves its own spotlight‚Äîespecially now, as India witnesses a brewing revolution in its coffee culture.

 A Colonial Beginning

Coffee first made its way into India in the 17th century, with the legendary tale of Baba Budan smuggling seven beans from Yemen and planting them in the hills of Chikkamagaluru, Karnataka. During the British colonial period, coffee plantations expanded across South India‚Äîparticularly in Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu‚Äîlaying the foundation for a deeply rooted coffee tradition.

The South Indian Filter Coffee Legacy

For decades, coffee has been an integral part of daily life in South Indian households. The aromatic blend of chicory-laced coffee, brewed in a traditional steel filter and served in a dabara-tumbler, is more than just a beverage‚Äîit's a ritual. This style of coffee continues to be a cultural emblem of southern hospitality and identity.

 Urban Coffee Culture on the Rise

Fast forward to the 21st century, and we're seeing a major shift. Coffee is no longer just about tradition; it‚Äôs becoming synonymous with urban cool. Indian metros like Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, and Hyderabad are witnessing a surge in:

Artisanal coffee brands

Specialty cafes with single-origin beans

Third-wave coffee culture, emphasizing quality, brewing techniques, and traceability

Whether it‚Äôs a Chemex in a minimalist caf√© or a pour-over at home, young Indians are developing a genuine appreciation for the craft behind the cup.

 Local Beans, Global Impact

India‚Äôs coffee-growing regions‚Äîlike Chikkamagaluru, Coorg, Araku Valley, and Wayanad‚Äîare now getting recognition for producing high-quality Arabica and Robusta beans. Local roasters and farmers‚Äô cooperatives are focusing on sustainability and traceability, making Indian coffee competitive on the global stage.",1,1749563689.0,india_tourism,1,1.0,False

1l7zc8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/1l7zc8l/show_us_what_youre_building/,Show us what you're building,"Hi everyone,

We wanted to introduce something we‚Äôve been building:¬†NextUp Games, a new space for discovering and following indie games.

The idea came from a problem we kept running into: it‚Äôs surprisingly hard to keep track of all the amazing indie games being made. We‚Äôd find something exciting, but staying up to date meant jumping between Steam pages, Twitter threads, Instagram posts, and buried devlogs. Even the best projects were easy to lose.

So we built something simple: a clean, focused platform where indie games are easier to discover, follow, and support, whether they‚Äôre just getting started, gearing up for release, or already out and looking for more players.

Right now, we‚Äôre in a pre-launch phase, gathering 100 submissions ahead of our public release on¬†**July 1**. Submissions made before then are completely free. After July 1, we‚Äôre planning to introduce a **one-time $10 fee**¬†for new game submissions. This small fee helps cover moderation, reduce spam, and keep the platform sustainable. Server bills and coffee aren‚Äôt free, sadly.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

You submit your game. We review it to make sure it meets a basic standard of quality and intent. If it‚Äôs approved, you‚Äôll pick a date for your spotlight on our homepage. That helps you grow your followers, reach new players, and build momentum over time.

This isn‚Äôt just about a quick spotlight or replacing existing platforms like Steam or¬†[itch.io](http://itch.io/). We‚Äôre working to solve the problem of great games getting buried beneath the constant stream of games being released. That means resurfacing projects intentionally, highlighting progress, and helping games stay visible beyond day one.

We have ideas for future features like Q&As with featured developers, articles, beta tester discovery, and other tools designed to support both indie creators and the people who care about their work.

If that sounds like something you want to be part of, we‚Äôd love to feature your game.

Thanks!

I mean, I‚Äôm not diagnosed or anything, but sometimes I suspect I was or am on the autism spectrum, especially during childhood and my teenage years.

As an adult, in my mid-twenties, I worked in a coffee shop, and years later I realized people were amazed by my energy.
They used to love coming in and having a chat with me.
I didn‚Äôt realize it at the time, but I was being so neurodivergent when I talked.
Talking about the universe, the meaning of life, real deep conversations because honestly, that was all I had in mind.
I even had some existential crises at work. Years later, some friends told me, ‚ÄúI loved your questions about life. That was the best part of working with you.‚Äù
Little did they know I was being dead serious and would think about those questions for months.

I masked a lot, so I used to copy people.
Even now, if I‚Äôm with a group of friends from another state who have a different accent, there I go, mimicking their accent when I talk back to them.
Not on purpose. It‚Äôs just a shift in my mind that happens naturally. But since I‚Äôve become more self-aware, I‚Äôve started noticing it.

Also, one reason people might love my energy is because I‚Äôm literally a mirror and I‚Äôm so good at knowing how to fit in.
No, that doesn‚Äôt make me happy because the price I‚Äôm paying is the cost of being who I really am.

I believe that behind my mask sits what feels like an older version of me, someone quite anhedonic, but not really.
I do have emotions, but deep down I‚Äôm just a serious guy with a very specific sense of humor.
I have this belief that the real version of me would make people kind of afraid and that it would push them away.
And now I know that I was once that version of myself.
I forgive him.
What happened is that the shell of me cracked.

I‚Äôm slowly letting that self come out.
I already quit my job because after a certain point, I couldn‚Äôt stand the number of people coming to the caf√© for a chat or just to see me.
And I think that was a good thing because it gave me a lot of insight into what I‚Äôm talking about now.

With so many people coming in, I realized after a while that that wasn‚Äôt really me. I was performing the whole time.
People liked a version of me that wasn‚Äôt actually me.
That became especially clear when I started burning out.
Some days I‚Äôd have a queue of 50 people, at least 20 of them regulars, each one bringing their own energy and vibe, and I had to switch my vibe constantly to match theirs.
That wore me out.

I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôd love to be that lovely guy I once was.
Ingenuous, naive, smiley, innocent, with no boundaries.
I feel like back then I was a spark of joy spreading love, and that‚Äôs why people liked me so much.

But the truth is, I thought I had to be that way in order for people to like me.

Now, I‚Äôm unmasking.
And looking back at my life, I believe a therapist could easily say I was on the autism spectrum.
And maybe sometimes I suspected that other people could perceive it even if they didn‚Äôt know exactly what it was.

I‚Äôve always had this feeling like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm different. I walk differently, my conversations are different, the look in my eyes is different.‚Äù

In the end, I know I‚Äôm different, even from who I used to be.
So even I acknowledge how different I was.

And that‚Äôs okay.
Part of me actually feels happy about that.
Part of me likes being different.
Part of me knows we‚Äôre all different from each other.

I guess I just wanted to put that somewhere.
So if you read this far, thank you.

As I was dying, my whole messed-up twenty-six years flashed through my brain like some twisted highlight reel. 

When I was seven, I first laid eyes on Declan Frost. One look at that tall kid with his whatever-don't-care attitude, and I was totally hooked.

By fifteen? Complete stalker status. Following him around like some obsessed fan while he acted like I was basically invisible. 

Then when I turned eighteen, everything went to he//ll. Declan's family lost it all overnight. His parents‚ÄîGod, they couldn't handle being broke and humiliated‚Äîjumped off their building together. Golden boy Declan suddenly had debt collectors breathing down his neck and not a penny to his name.

I tracked him down mixing drinks at this sketchy bar downtown. Those same hands that used to play at fancy concerts were now pouring shots for drunk businessmen. That night, I made my move: ""I'll pay off everything you owe, but you're mine now."" We signed the papers right there between shifts.

Fast forward to twenty-two, and Declan had clawed his way back. Total rags-to-riches comeback, landing him on Forbes with all the other billionaires. Then he met her‚ÄîOlivia Reed, some broke intern with ""principles"" and a ""good heart"" or whatever.

Suddenly he's throwing money at me to get out of our deal. First ten times what I paid, then more, then way more. Every time, I shut him down with the same line: ""You promised forever. Not giving you a single second back.""

At twenty-five, Olivia finally gave up and left the country. Her plane supposedly crashed somewhere over the Pacific. They even never found her body.

Declan completely lost it. He went after my family's companies like a man possessed, tearing everything down brick by brick. Soon enough, my parents ended up just like his‚Äîchoosing to jump rather than face what was coming.

At twenty-six, after a year of Declan's relentless psychological tor//ture, my body finally gave up.

As the snow piled over me and everything started fading to black, I saw her‚ÄîOlivia freaking Reed, back from the dead‚Äîthrowing herself into Declan's arms like some romance movie reunion scene.

""Declan!"" She was sobbing all over his expensive coat. ""I'm alive! Someone pulled me from the crash... I've been trying to find you for so long!""

It felt like the longest nightmare ever‚Äîjust pure suffering and total hopelessness... the kind that drags on forever.

But then... my eyes snapped open.

Wait. I wasn't dead.

I was back. 

Now, I had another chance.

Declan's assistant stood in front of me, his face totally blank as he pushed a black credit card across the table.

""Miss Hawthorne,"" he said like a robot, ""third time's the charm, right? I'm here again about Mr. Frost wanting out of your little arrangement. He's offering five billion dollars this time. Just let him go, and all that money is yours...""

His droning voice snapped me out of my brain fog. I shivered hard, remembering that creepy mechanical voice right before everything went black.

I was back three years?

The assistant finished his script and saw me staring into space. He was already gearing up for another ""he//ll no"" from me when he leaned in to grab his stuff. I caught his wrist.

""I'll take it.""

His eyes bugged out. ""Wait‚Äîyou're actually saying yes? You're letting Mr. Frost off the hook?""

Without missing a beat, I scribbled my signature and pocketed the card.

After kicking him out, my hands wouldn't stop shaking. 

Tears came to my eyes as I called my parents in a panic.

""Mom, Dad, drop everything and apply for those overseas residency papers now. Move every penny offshore. We need to get out of here and never look back.""

Dead silence on the line. ""Nora, sweetie, what's going on?""

How do you explain time travel to your parents? You don't. ""I had this super messed-up nightmare where staying here got us all killed. We lost literally everything.""

They tried talking me down, but I kept pushing until I broke down crying. My parents had always been pushovers when it came to me, so they caved.

I'd barely hung up and wiped my face when Declan freaking Frost barged through the door. Seeing my puffy eyes, his face went stone cold.

""Still won't sign, huh? Look, I screwed up by trying to break our deal, but five billion dollars? Come on. What more could you possibly want?""

I froze. Guess his little messenger boy hadn't updated him. I tried to tell him, but Declan cut me off.

""Whatever‚Äîwe're going to the hospital. Now."" He grabbed my arm and hauled me out the door.

We tore through traffic and screeched to a stop at the ER entrance. Declan dragged me toward some surgical ward where I caught a doctor's urgent voice.

‚ÄúMr. Frost, Miss Reed's renal transplant is ready to go.‚Äù

And that's when it dawned on me that in my past life, my car crashed, my renal system was destroyed, and in that nightmare, Declan didn't show up once.

So why drag me here? This has nothing to do with me.

And then it hit me, ‚ÄúWait, did you bring me here to force me to give my renal organs to Olivia?‚Äù

Declan gave me a cold look. ""Not you. Me. Me.

‚ÄúYou're going to give her the kid//ney?‚Äù My jaw dropped.

He looked at the thin figure through the surgery window."" Olivia's renal was destroyed in a car accident. I'm a match for her.""

Even though I'd already decided to bail on this whole situation, hearing Declan would literally give up an organ for her felt like a knife to the gut.

""You really love her that much?"" The words just slipped out.

""Yeah,"" he didn't even hesitate. ""That's exactly why you're here‚Äîso I can keep an eye on you. No way am I letting you pull some psycho stunt when she's this vulnerable!""

With that charming goodbye, he told his goons to babysit me, changed into one of those paper gowns, and disappeared behind the surgical doors. The red light blinked on.

I sat there like a zombie, my heart feeling like it was being squeezed in a vise.

Two nurses walked by, arms linked like besties, gossiping loud enough for the whole floor to hear.

""Can you believe that guy? Giving up his actual kid//ney for the woman he loves. Like, who even does that anymore?""

I just listened, my lips twisting into this sad little smile that didn't reach my eyes.

Talk about a reality check, right?

Those two were meant for each other. 

And this time around, I needed to go find my own life.

The surgery wrapped up without a hitch.

When the light over the operating room clicked off, I tried to bolt, but the security meathead grabbed my arm.

""Boss said you're not going anywhere till he wakes up.""

So there I sat, trapped like a rat. The minutes dragged on until my stomach cramped up out of freaking nowhere.

I doubled over, sweat pouring down my face like I'd just run a marathon. My stupid gastritis was back with a vengeance. My lips were so dry they were cracking as I looked up at the guard.

""Look, I'm dying here,"" I gasped. ""Could you just grab me some stomach meds? Or even just a cup of hot water? Please?""

The guard stared at me like I was trying to pull a prison break. Guy had the emotional range of a doorknob.

""No can do, Miss Hawthorne. You could be on fire and we still wouldn't leave. Boss's orders.""

So he'd let me suffer for precious Olivia? Awesome.

Every word felt like someone sitting on my ch//est. The pain got so bad I straight-up collapsed onto the floor, biting my lip till I tasted blood as everything went fuzzy...

I came to with my face pressed against the cold floor tiles.

The guard noticed me stirring and announced like he was reading off a grocery list, ""Boss is awake now. You can go beg him to let you leave.""

My whole body felt like I'd been hit by a truck. My clothes were soaked through with sweat, making me shiver like crazy.

I somehow peeled myself off the floor and zombie-walked to Declan's room. That's when I heard Olivia's sugary voice oozing through the door.

""Declan, why do you look awful? You're totally wiped out. Hey‚Äîdid you find out who gave me the kidn//ey? I want to thank them in person. I mean, without them, I'd probably be dead right now.""

Declan froze mid-spoonful before quickly playing it cool.

He blew on the porridge and fed it to her like she was made of glass, his voice all soft and gooey. ""It's nothing. I just look like death because I was freaking out while you were under the knife. The donor..."" He hesitated. ""They didn't make it. I'll thank their family for you. Don't stress‚ÄîI've got everything covered.""

Olivia practically melted, throwing herself at him like a lovesick teenager.

She must've nailed his surgical spot because Declan went white as a sheet, but he didn't make a sound and just kept feeding her like nothing happened.

Olivia didn't notice a thing and stayed all cuddled up against him, getting teary-eyed. ""Oh wait, didn't your security guy just say Nora collapsed from her stomach thing? Shouldn't you check if she's okay?""

The second my name left Olivia's lips, Declan's face went dark. ""She's faking it for attention. Just ignore her.""

Standing outside the window like some creepy stalker, I felt this hollow ache spread through my heart.

In whatever messed-up thing Declan and I had, I'd gone all in, while he'd rather jump off a cliff than be with me.

But with Olivia? She didn't have to lift a finger. Declan would come running, handing over everything‚Äîeven parts of his actual body.

He loved her enough to give her his own kid//ney but wouldn't tell her‚Äîjust so she wouldn't feel bad or whatever.

And that's when it really sank in just how huge the gap is between being someone's everything and being... whatever I was to him.

They had no clue I was eavesdropping.

Olivia took a few more bites before pushing the bowl away. ""This porridge tastes like cardboard. Remember that little hole-in-the-wall outside our college? I used to eat there every morning. God, I miss that place.""

Seeing her all nostalgic, Declan dropped everything and grabbed his keys. ""I'll go get you some.""

""Don't be ridiculous! Send one of your minions for something that small!""

Declan shook his head, tucking her in like a child. ""Anything that matters to you‚Äîthe places you hung out, the food you scarfed down, the stuff you've seen‚ÄîI want to experience it all myself. Hang tight. Back in a flash.""

As he pushed the door open, he slammed right into me.

The smile on his face disappeared so fast it was like someone had hit a switch, replaced with that cold, you're-garbage expression I knew way too well.

""What are you doing here? Looking to mess with Olivia again?""

Watching his face morph so completely, my hands started shaking.

I su//cked in a breath. ""Just wanted to say I'm done causing drama with Olivia. You can chill.""

Declan never bought anything I said, and this time was no different.

""If you really want me to chill, then rip up our contract. Let me go!""

With that, he brushed past me like I was invisible, never hearing what I whispered after him.

""Declan, I already did... let you go.""

When I got home, I wolfed down a sandwich and started packing.

Most of the stuff was mine. Declan barely owned anything, and half of what he did have I'd bought for him anyway.

Jackets, makeup, perfume, coffee mugs, toothbrushes...

I didn't keep a single thing. I tossed it all‚Äîthe secret photos I'd snapped of him over the years, those embarrassing love letters I wrote as a teenager, every last bit of it‚Äîstraight into the garbage.

The day I finally purged every trace of what I'd stupidly called ""home,"" Declan decided to show up.

He walked in and immediately got that ""something's off"" look. After scanning the room, he frowned. ""Where's all my stuff?""

""Trashed it,"" I said point-blank.

Declan gave me that dismissive side-eye he'd perfected, his expression hardening. ""I disappear for a few days and you go full psycho?""

""I only tossed the stuff I paid for. Didn't touch your precious junk. Besides, you barely used any of it.""

Hearing that, Declan jumped to his favorite conclusion‚Äîthat I was complaining about him breaking our agreement by staying away.

His eyebrows did that angry thing, voice going glacier-cold. ""How many times do I have to say it? I'm done with that stupid contract. I don't want to be stuck with you forever. Just sign the freaking papers already.""

This center was meant to be ""specialized devs, than can create code way faster than do-it-all kind of devs, for cheaper, on an offshore country"".

The reality was, like in all consulting companies, very different (except for the ""for cheaper..."" part, that was true).

The team consisted of a truckload of recent graduates or university students that were given a 2-3 week course on a technology, plus a couple team leaders and probably around one overworked senior dev per team.

Oh, and a PMO/QA department. PMO means, for those who don't know, Project Management Office. The PMO had to make sure that those plans for a coffee machine ended up with a coffee machine being delivered instead of a coffee mug. Or that if the customer asked for a Porsche 911, it ends with a car, not a bike with a Porsche 911 sticker on the side (examples that everyone can understand, the company actually dealt with software).

I was part that PMO/QA department. When I say part it means me and another experienced guy handled everything PMO, and a QA senior and a QA junior handled all the testing plans of all the teams. So 4 people to do PMO and QA for around 80-100 devs, split between 14-16 teams.

To make things BETTER (worse) the top brass decided to certify the dev center with ISO practices, which meant that PMO work grew quite a bit and we had to be on top of everything much much more since we needed to have everything perfect for the appraisal.

The head of the dev center was ELJEFE. He was a spanish villanous lad who had a knack for firing, underpaying people and generally cutting expenses to the minimum.

He decided that a HR department was too much for the company, so he scrapped the dev center's one and had one IN ANOTHER COUNTRY handle everything, he scrapped aptitude and attitude tests and he conducted interviews himself. That's why the devs were the most random collection of... let's just say... curious human beings available for cheap in the market (including the narcolepsy albino goth metal guy, the former bodyguard, the guy that did parkour during the weekends and wasn't able to use his hands to type on a keyboard every monday, and so many more characters that would render The Office as a pretty normal workplace environment)

ELJEFE calls me and the other PMO guy and says ""listen, the quality of requirements coming to the dev center is really lacking. ISO will fail us if they see what we accept. Draft a standard template and a guide on how requirements should be sent to us and I will forward it to all our customers. From now on, every single requirement that enters the center has to be evaluated and can be rejected if they don't met standards""

What ELJEFE doesn't remember, is that we're developing an internal app for the whole company, and requirements are being sent, via email, on a word document that has nconnected phrases and thoughts, directly from the CEO and CTO of the whole multinational company, that the dev team has to make sense of. So I say ""Everything? are you sure? Because...""

Before I can even muster another word, ELJEFE burst into flames and says ""Am I speaking chinese or what? Everything is everything! Do your effing job and don't bother me with this anymore!""

""Roger that"" and we left, sent a quick meeting notes email to ELJEFE, drafted the template and guide according to ISO requirements, sent it to ELJEFE and carried on with our work.

Next week, update on requirements directly from the CTO. I don't even bother opening the document, I hit reply and copy paste the established message ""Requisite rejected. Not compliant with established standards.""

Literally 30 seconds after replying, the telephone rings: ""THIS IS CTO, WHO GAVE YOU POWER TO REJECT A REQUISITE FROM ME? DON'T YOU KNOW WHO I AM""

Me: ""Hi CTO, yes, I know who you are, ELJEFE told us that we have to reject every single thing that's not ISO compliant, no matter where it comes from. I have the notes from the meeting, I tried to tell him that we were doing things slightly different on your project, he said that EVERYTHING had to be done by the book, so I have to reject your request, I can forward you the template you have to complete again if you want...""

Not even answering, CTO finishes the call and I can hear ELJEFE's phone ringing. All I could hear from our desk is ELJEFE saying ""yes... yes... no, I understand... but... I know... yes... please no... won't happen again... I will tell them... yes... sorry about that... thank you"".

And ELJEFE comes out of the office, white as a ghost, slowly walks towards our desk and says ""guys, the internal app project is excluded from the ISO scope, so we don't have to be strict with it.""

Oklahoma lawmakers didn‚Äôt think we deserved to know their plans as session ended, and they did a lot
---------

- Date: June 9, 2025
- In: The Journal Record & Oklahoma Voice
- By: Janelle Stecklein

Oklahoma‚Äôs lawmakers are supposed to be accountable to the people who elected them, but our legislators conveniently forgot that last month in their frenetic scramble to reach the finish line.

Lawmakers spent the final night of the annual legislative session chugging cups of coffee and scarfing down pizza as they cast dozens upon dozens of consequential votes while most of their constituents slept.

When Oklahomans awoke the morning of May 30, they suddenly found themselves with nearly four dozen new laws ramrodded through the Legislature in the dead of night. Meanwhile, the head of a state agency woke up unemployed after legislators suddenly decided to fire her just before the stroke of midnight.

It‚Äôs not necessarily problematic that lawmakers cast votes at night: That happens many years because they procrastinate or are otherwise disorganized. What was extremely concerning this time was that they entered ‚Äî and exited ‚Äî the penultimate day without a full public agenda posted.

If their sparse public agenda was to be believed, the state House of Representatives and Senate had no plans to take up any veto overrides or even the state‚Äôs mental health commissioner.

The reality was starkly different.

It turns out our elected officials, who we pay to operate in the public, strode into session, secretly planning to override Gov. Kevin Sittt‚Äôs vetoes on a wide range of topics ranging from mammogram screenings to food truck fire safety to investigations of missing and murdered Indigenous women.

But they apparently didn‚Äôt think the public was entitled to know those plans. It wasn‚Äôt until they actually started voting that the public got an inkling that something was afoot.
How is that good governing? Do our lawmakers think they know so much better than their constituents that they don‚Äôt believe the people they represent should be able to weigh in on significant issues? Or is it just that they think the only voices that matter are the lobbyists gathered around the chamber television screens watching the shenanigans play out in real time?

Is it any wonder that Stitt posted a video on social media frustrated with all the last-minute maneuvering and telling voters to watch closely?

Because make no mistake, these were consequential votes. A successful override of the governor‚Äôs veto meant these measures became law.

And there were some great veto overrides like increasing women‚Äôs access to mammogram screenings and focusing resources to help tackle the state‚Äôs Missing Murdered and Indigenous People crisis.

But there were some headscratchers. One such veto override saw lawmakers waste nearly five hours deadlocked on a strange bill that changed the leadership requirements to become the Oklahoma National Guard‚Äôs top leader. Stitt said later it creates a new pension system, will cost taxpayers a lot of money and that lawmakers didn‚Äôt know what they were voting on.

The Legislature decided Allie Friesen, the mental health commissioner, needed to go with all the chaos surrounding her agency‚Äôs budgetary disarray, cut and canceled contracts and the need for tens of millions of dollars just to make payroll. Lawmakers were so disillusioned with her leadership in the final days that they essentially stripped her of her power to directly implement a landmark mental health settlement that involves providing competency restoration services for indigent defendants.

Stitt, who opposed the firing, said Friesen disturbed ‚Äúthe status quo and questioned long held practices at the agency.‚Äù He also criticized Sen. Paul Rosino, R-Oklahoma City, and Rep. Josh West, R-Grove, who ran the measure, questioning what they stand to gain, what they were trying to keep covered up, if they have conflicts of interest, and if Rosino was ‚Äútrying to help his wife avoid responsibility for her role in the finance department there.‚Äù

Rosino admitted during questioning on the Senate floor that his wife works as a part-time employee at the agency. She was apparently working there even while her husband was helping lead investigatory hearings into the agency‚Äôs operations and sought Friesen‚Äôs firing. Stitt later apologized for bringing Rosino‚Äôs wife into the conversation.

We‚Äôve entrusted our lawmakers with an enormous amount of power.

They‚Äôre pretty much the only governmental entity in the entire state that is not subject to the Open Meeting and Open Records Act. Even the Governor‚Äôs Office has to comply with both laws.

That means legislators basically do whatever they want, when they want and how they want. The public can‚Äôt look at their correspondence to determine what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes that could influence their decision-making
Given lawmakers‚Äô secretive behavior, I think it begs the question, do they continue to deserve this level of trust? Lawmakers, how would you answer this question?

Got some polish from my Writing Group friends (shout-out to the inestimable Wriste and Tasz) and looking now for readability. This isn't going to commercial spaces, so I'm not looking for ""would you enjoy reading this over your morning coffee,"" but rather a pretty simple ""did the story hold together, did it deliver the emotional punch I was looking for, did any parts sag,"" etc. It's a complete ""flash"" piece, which means it has to tell a full story, with some amount of character development, in under 800 words, it needs to have momentum, a strong opening and finish, no saggy middle bits, no wasted words, and it needs to deliver an emotional punch.

1l7yqnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1l7yqnf/wifi_disconnects/,Wifi disconnects,")Hello

Thanks in advance.

So from time to time my pc disconnects from wifi. There's no cause I can ascertain, so I can't replicate it. Read a bunch but not sure what the next trouble shooting step is apart from replacing my wifi card.

I'll first know it's happening because a website won't load or a video will stop buffering. Shortly, after that wifi in the toolbar will stopping showing connection strength and switch to the not connected symbol (the wireframe globe?)

After that, my primary home network will show but no other ssid show. My computer also won't reconnect. Disabling and reenabling the wifi in network setting is my go to ""fix"". A full restart will get it working as well.

During the disconnect, the wifi card shows in device manager and is working fine (at least as far as windows 11 is concerned)Connection is otherwise good. Get full strength the wifi router is almost directly below where the computer is, but it used to happen in a different room as well. No other device ever lose thei connection like this.

I have  
TP-Link Archer T4E Dual-Band Wireless AC1200 PCI-E Adapter  
Router is an Archer c6  
Drivers are 2024.10.143.0 (most recent according to [Download for Archer T4E | TP-Link United Kingdom](https://www.tp-link.com/uk/support/download/archer-t4e/)

The only troubleshooting suggestion I managed to find is to change power management in device manager so that the computer is not allowed to turn the device off, which I have done.

Rest of my pc is

1. CoolerMaster MasterBox Q300L Micro-ATX Case - Black Window
2. Asus Prime H310M-K Intel H310 DDR4 Coffee Lake Micro ATX Motherboard
3. I7-8700K 3.7Ghz Turbo Quad Core Coffee Lake CPU Processor - LGA 1151""
4. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti
5. Adata XPG Spectrix D60G 16GB (2 x 8GB) 3000Mhz DDR4 RGB

I (30M) and my gf (28F) have a issue. We are going on vacation on the 20th of this month to Spain where she is from and we will be staying with het parents like we have done before in the past multiple times. Earlier this year I got diagnosed with testicular cancer and I had to get chemo, i‚Äôm done with the chemo now for a little over 2 weeks and my gf is really looking forward to the vacation for some alone time for us and offcourse to see her family again. It was and still is a stressfull and difficult time for us cause we don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm cancerfree till the 9th of July. While it has been stressfull for us it has also been very stressfull for my mother (56F) and she is on the edge of being overstrained so we said why don‚Äôt you come with us to Spain? We are gonna do our own thing, which my mom is totally fine with cause that‚Äôs what she wants to but then she isn‚Äôt alone and we can still do things together. The next day my gf says to me she is not really comfortable with it cause she wants to be alone with me and her family, and while I understand her we have already offered it to my mother. Now we have said it to my mother and she was really dissapointed and had to cry cause my gf made her feel like she was to much which I also understand cause my gf didn‚Äôt use the right words imo. Now there is a wedge between them and i‚Äôm in the middle and I feel terrible cause I told my gf I didn‚Äôt like it how she said it and the whole reason behind it and she became very mad, didn‚Äôt listen to a word I had to say so I went away and came back later cause I don‚Äôt like yelling and want to talk normally. Her reasoning for not wanting my mother with us is cause she is afraid I will be to much with my mom and not with her and her family but I will not do that, I‚Äôm on vacation with my gf visiting her family but yes, offcourse when my mother is in the same town for a week I will go see her and drink coffee with her multiple times that week but my gf finds that weird and I‚Äôm just very irritated at this whole siuation cause it‚Äôs so dumb.

I can't drive 1 mile without it dinging or beeping.     Now, the back-up camera is ""detecting"" an object and not permitting me to continue reversing without grinding the brakes.

Page 1. Beware the lava.

There is no need to hide anything. It smells like a crime if you know what I‚Äôm talking about. Everybody knows that there are some miscreants. And in general, if you obey the law and watch yourself, you‚Äôll never contact that side of life.

Well, maybe the situation with magic is a bit more subtle. A tiny little bit.

I saw the guy this evening on my way home after another fruitless meeting. One more day of tailing the mystery/city legend. I was lost in thought, so I didn‚Äôt notice anything strange before too late. In the narrow side street, cutting my way home, I saw‚Ä¶ somebody? It was a shape of a human near the brick wall. Like an old coat hanging from the drainpipe, or a drunker with a weak bladder ‚Äì nothing attractive or intriguing. I slowed down just to discern what was it, exactly, and only then I noticed the strange part in the dim dusk light: a hand, stretching from the coat-like shadow and kind of beating a rhythm on the bricks. I saw the hand only: no shoulder or head on top of it, no legs. You can say that in moments like this people should feel scared or even panic, or at least say something like ‚ÄúWhat a hell?‚Äù but I just froze on my feet. This rhythm affected me in some unfathomable way. For a second I remembered a moment from the deep past, such deep so I didn‚Äôt even realize that I still remember it. I was standing on the shining golden floor, and yet the floor was far away from me, like a chasm away. I swayed and fell down ‚Äì

‚Äì both in the memory and for real. Raised my head, trying to shake the illusion/memory away. No strange figure near the wall. No rhythm, nothing. Only chills running through my body. And my heart pounding heavily in the chest. I hit an elbow, it pained quite a bit, I tried to stand up ‚Äì and realized that it was far more difficult than I expected. Old cracked concrete in this side street was slightly melting, as if trying to suck me in. So I shouted with terror and fumbled on my feet, and dragged myself away with all the might the late-coming panic gave me, and ran like a madman.

Quite an embarrassing experience it was, I should say. At least nobody tried to call the police. I didn‚Äôt want to spend a night explaining what I saw and that I wasn‚Äôt under substances.

So I calmed down, slowed my gait, and reconsidered what just happened. A) I was looking for a *magi* through this useless fun-boy‚Äôs forum. B) I saw a real one on my way home ‚Äì or maybe I caught a hallucination because of overexertion over the last weeks. C) I should figure out how to‚Ä¶ do something about it.

After all, I have no choice.

I paused before entering our flat. Breathe in, breathe out. No real reasons to break the routine. Any additional stress may worsen his condition. So just keep it together, alright? I‚Äôm coming in.

‚Äì Is it you, Alex?

My father. Look at him: always trying to look like nothing can bother this guy.

It never suited him, really. Mother used to say that even when they just met he had this look of a weather-beaten roamer, though he never roamed anything but his commute. I bet he practiced this look by the mirror.

Now he‚Äôs wearing the old ironed white shirt and jeans shorts. Clothes look few sizes too big for him. There is not much he can do by himself except ironing one shirt each morning and walking slowly around the apartment. It‚Äôs way too easy to get tired if you have that stage of inoperable sarcoma.

He‚Äôs sitting in a creaking chair and reading a paper. He didn‚Äôt read it when I opened the door. He took it from his knees just now ‚Äì to look like a dignified man, spending his evening with a good read.

‚Äì I‚Äôll make a coffee, pa.

‚Äì I was just about to make it myself. But if you do, add a drop of‚Ä¶

‚Äì No way, and don‚Äôt you even ask me, please.

He grunts, and I hear the quiet sound of a paper lowering back to its place.

I‚Äôm sitting in the kitchen waiting for the kettle to boil, my fingers on the temples.

Father has a month, maybe two, they say. Everybody thinks I am crazy running around the streets and looking for illusionists and charlatans while I could just spend these days with him.

But I found it. Sort of. It‚Äôs a shadow of a hint, at the very least. So, what should I do now?

The kettle clicked, I‚Äôve got Dad‚Äôs favorite mug and poured boiling water into it.

‚Äì Da-a-ad! A lost hunter is running around the forest and screaming ‚ÄúHelp, I‚Äôm lost!‚Äù.

‚Äì Why?

‚Äì No matter! So he hears something in the bushes nearby and comes closer, and then sees a bear standing out of this bush. And bear‚Äôs asking: ‚ÄúWhy are you shouting around, human?‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúI-I was hoping that help can hear me‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúWell, I heard you ‚Äì said the bear ‚Äì Did it help?‚Äù

‚Äì It‚Äôs an old one, - father chuckles, almost lying in the chair.

‚Äì I know. Just popped up in my mind.

The coffee‚Äôs in front of him, steaming. Now, Dad will wait for it to get to the right temperature ‚Äì four to five minutes. He likes these little waiting periods. They give him a purpose, however miniscule it may be.

I sit nearby, warming up my palms, still shaking subtly after the side street experience. The cup feels too hot in my hands, so I put it on the table and stare in the window. For a while, we both say nothing. Play-pretend part of the day, before I‚Äôll need to check that he took all the drugs, and then we‚Äôll check the blood pressure and body temperature, and I‚Äôll ask about his pain, and he‚Äôll lie that he feels alright. Then I‚Äôll do as many chores as I can before crashing to sleep. I have too many thoughts to fit them into this moment. That‚Äôs okay. The only reality I‚Äôve got.

‚Äì I know this song; - he brakes the silence.

‚Äì I beg your pardon?

He tries and fails to tap a vaguely familiar melody with his knuckles. Then tries to hum it. I‚Äôm still clueless. Finally, he waves at me in irritation:

‚Äì The one you were just tapping out. ‚ÄúThe Crossroads‚Äù? Pretty sure that‚Äôs the name. Linda used to love it. Before you were born, she‚Ä¶

He continues, but I‚Äôm not listening anymore. I watch my palm on the table very attentively. Given the lackluster light in the kitchen, it shouldn‚Äôt produce such a deep black shadow. And the pinky finger of said shadow moves, leaving quickly vanishing traces on the surface: the first one I‚Äôm able to discern looks like an ‚Äúe‚Äù. Then ‚Äút‚Äù. ‚Äúb‚Äù. ‚Äúa‚Äù.

‚Äì ‚Ä¶so I was just pretending I like it, too, though in reality‚Ä¶ are you listening? Alex?

‚Äúc‚Äù. ‚Äúk‚Äù.

I jump to my feet, not really sure if it happens for real or if I‚Äôm going to wake up in a few seconds.

‚Äì I forgot something. Be back soon.

The shadow lingers on the surface a couple of seconds longer than a well-behaved shadow should. Luckily, Dad didn‚Äôt notice.

‚Äì ‚ÄòKay, son. You know where to find me.

He might have said something else, but I‚Äôd put the boots on, grabbed my jacket, and shut the door closed beating a couple of world records.

Thinking back, I should have said that I love him, no matter the hurry. But that's the thing with mad hopes. They make you numb to the obvious. The streetlights outside were slightly too yellow as if the air itself was luminous. I can remember it so well now, but I didn‚Äôt pay attention then. And if by some (other) miracle I‚Äôd find out what was going to happen, I doubt even then it would stop me. Knowing ain‚Äôt believing, and I wouldn‚Äôt ever believe in such a crazy tale.

I find the spot easily. No shadowy figures, no quicksand-concrete.

‚Äì I‚Äôm here! You said to get back, didn‚Äôt you?

The thing is, I have no idea what to do next. All I have is a bunch of ‚Äúwitness reports‚Äù on the Internet and even less reliable rumors. Magi can answer requests. Sincere requests, but only under a number of conditions. The list of possible conditions is so long that you can make a phone book out of it; no one knows the real ones.

I try to hum the song I don‚Äôt really remember. The rhythm that I‚Äôve heard just twice. Cold sweat on my fingers, I touch the brick wall and tap it out. How did that shadow look? I face the wall, hump my shoulders. Close my eyes, trying to concentrate. It‚Äôs not gonna work, is it?

The moment I turn to go back home I see two very big brick-made arms protruding from behind me. They encircle me and pull in. I can hear my ribs crackle. I try to scream, but I have no time, nor air to do it.

Things would be oh so simpler if I died there.

Page 2. One star.

If you know that‚Äôs something new is going to happen in your life ‚Äì you will try to imagine it. It‚Äôs only natural. Who is this new coworker that will start tomorrow? Is this fancy restaurant really that good? Can I say I changed my mind and won‚Äôt jump with a parachute?

The thing is, imagination is a very bad prophet.

I struggled; it didn‚Äôt help at all. While I was pulled through the wall, one of the brick arms covered my chest and neck, and the second one ‚Äì the abdomen. It was extremely painful for a brief moment. I didn‚Äôt fully process the pain; it should have broken some evolutionary barrier inside my brain, the one that mercifully prevents your senses from firing signals when the trauma is too big for you to survive.

Then my spine broke, too, and I lost all and every tactile input from the body. I‚Äôd like to say it all was surreal, but it wasn‚Äôt.

Still, I prefer to conceptualize the following events as a fidget of my imagination. Just a nightmare.

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre going to buy groceries, and it gets slightly out of control. You end up with a bunch of bags, all too heavy to carry, but you‚Äôre stubborn and try anyway. You manage to get out of the shop, and then walk as fast as possible to your car. But bags rip apart right in the middle of the distance, and everything falls down on the grass.

It's the best metaphor I can come up with without being too descriptive. My head moved through the wall relatively intact. My body became a bloody mess of dismantled parts that fell down with the most sickening meaty splash I‚Äôve ever heard.

Trying to process all of this logically creates too many questions I don‚Äôt want to ask, so it‚Äôs reasonable to just describe what was happening from my point of view instead. That‚Äôs the interesting part.

My point of view was removed from my head; it was like being just a disembodied observation point about four meters higher than my head. The head was also stuck in the air, quite high over the ground. Merciful, too: this way I wasn‚Äôt able to focus on the pile of‚Ä¶ the other things downside.

Try to look right in front of you and then describe what‚Äôs in the periphery. If objects around are familiar, that‚Äôs easy. But your eyes will still do these small reflex movements ‚Äì saccades ‚Äì trying to focus on the things you‚Äôre not looking at. You can‚Äôt completely stop them. But well, my newly-obtained status of disembodied observation point didn‚Äôt provide me with saccades, so the picture I saw wasn‚Äôt very detailed.

My head was fixed in the air over a meadow. It was morning, judging by the lights. Bright green grass, a lot of flowers. The widening stain of blood was vanishing gradually. I think I heard a very quiet hum of insects. It was getting closer, converging.

The perspective shifted suddenly as if somebody cut out a useless part of the broadcast.

I was still following my head, but now it was carried by a stream of water, so pure that it was almost invisible. Only blinks of light and little distortions betrayed the nature of the flow. It should have been like that for quite a while already; no blood trace behind the head. Trying as I could not to look at it, my attention was still pinned down. My ‚Äúcamera‚Äù had no eyelids to close. Thinking back, the strangest part is how calm my consciousness was at that moment. The feelings and reactions we have are very much dictated by the bodily functions: hormones, blood pressure, neurotransmitters. I didn‚Äôt have any at that moment, I suppose. That should have been the reason.

And yet, I felt like my mind tried its best to shutter itself to pieces. Really strange, as if the non-reality of these events was hidden inside a glass ball, and someone pressed on it with all his might ‚Äì in vain ‚Äì to crash it.

I was looking at my head, as it swam down the creek; its mouth opened and closed, producing the same repeating sound: ‚Äúagr-, agr-, agr-‚Äú. At times, water covered it completely, and the sound stopped. I liked these stretches more.

The creek gradually turned into the marsh, covered with water lilies and big purple flowers on meaty leaves. The plants were so lush that my head was visible only at moments. The flow of water got slower, the steady stream turned into a chaotic series of lazy vortexes. Finally, my head stuck upon a tiny islet, the mouth now full of leaves and seaweed. Out of my view, a woman came to shore and grabbed the head out of the water.

She was slim, silver-haired, and young. Maybe in her twenties. At no point I was able to look at her face directly. Average height, white jeans, gray shirt, tiny silver jacket, one that‚Äôs impossible to button up. She turned my head around, as if checking something, then carefully removed the weeds out of the mouth and listened. The same spasmodic movements, the same meaningless syllable. She nodded in conformation and moved away. The perspective changed again.

It was very dark now, but not like during the night. The darkness you can observe inside a large empty building with no sources of light. And despite that, everything around was clearly visible. The closest comparison I can come up with is a theatre stage.

The clear-water marsh was stretching all around, as far as I could judge from my position. My position changed slightly, too; ‚ÄúI‚Äù was higher in the air, and moved around the scene very slowly.

The woman from before was right there, now in a stylish yet very practical coat that reminded me of a doctor‚Äôs attire for some reason. Maybe because of huge pockets on both sides; the woman hid her hands inside them. I think it was cold, though I have no way to say for sure. In front of her stood a strange construction: a few metal rings of almost identical radius ‚Äì about two meters ‚Äì imbued into each other at different angles. Pretty much a centrifuge-like attraction I visited once as a teenager; the rings moved smoothly, each at its own plane and speed. In the center of this thing was‚Ä¶ me?

The head was definitely mine. It didn‚Äôt move anymore, thankfully. Other body parts were at their proper places. But they consisted of grass, weed, earth, and rocks. And strangely yellowish threads of cobweb that were tying all the other stuff together. ‚ÄúMy‚Äù hands and legs reminded a poorly-made scarecrow, but closer to the neck assortment of elements was becoming indistinguishable from a normal human body. ‚ÄúI‚Äù even had my usual clothes, at least partially.

The woman raised her head and looked straight into my ‚Äúcamera‚Äù, her face still not in focus.

‚Äì It will take a while.

I didn‚Äôt mind it much. Want to resurrect me as a mud golem? Well, beats being a flying piece of nothingness, I‚Äôd say.

The pressure to shutter my own mind went away. Mad hopes and their side-effects. To distract myself from the not so pleasant observation at least a little, I thought about her voice. Melodic, with a cutting tint of irony to it. Tired. Like that one overburdened manager at your workplace who always ends up solving a crisis because nobody else can.

Otherwise, she looked extremely normal. Such a hair color cannot be natural, I believe, but who‚Äôll judge a lady for wanting to look fancier? Please do your miracles, magi, I have so much questions and just one request. But before that, I‚Äôd really like to properly exist again, and then maybe we can talk.

For an hour or so, not much happened.

I flew in circles, unable to switch my focus from the slowly materializing ‚Äì stabilizing? Recreated? ‚Äì body in the center of the machine. The woman occasionally made a few steps, all the while looking attentively at the work-in-progress. As the body was getting closer and closer to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, the cobweb became dimmer until its shine went out.

The rings of the machine slowly stopped. I was too high above, and it was dark, but I almost sure I saw ripples over the metal. Countless tiny dots moving chaotically. I think they were spiders.

Next time the woman spoke, she didn‚Äôt raise her eyes on me.

‚Äì You owe me one for this.

Whatever, lady. You know I can‚Äôt answer. If I were you, I‚Äôd wait until this grass-made corpse of mine could receive my flying soul, and then we can start the discussion.

The darkness got thicker. Whatever luminosity this place had, it was getting weaker now. At the edges of my view things began to hide into obscurity.

She took a few minutes to inspect the end-result. Slapped ‚Äúmy‚Äù hands, body and legs with both her palms. Checked pockets on the body; pulled out and inspected my keys, phone, wallet. A lighter. A receipt from the pharmacy. Nothing really caught her interest. Then he pulled ‚Äúmy‚Äù hair with such intensity that whole body shook.

Finally, she made a content sigh. Then stepped back, fumbled around with her left hand and pulled down. My ‚Äúcamera‚Äù suddenly came to an uncomfortably close distance to her neck. She was very pale indeed, a shade away from pure albino. I tried and failed to notice any other distinctive feature.

The perspective shifted the last time.

I inhaled so intensely that my lungs hurt, and then I cried and screamed, and then cried and screamed some more. Then somebody slapped me on my face.

I‚Äôve always been ‚Äúscrunchy‚Äù but never full blown crunchy. Ever since becoming pregnant, I‚Äôve realized how many things I was using were toxic and I want to start a more crunchy lifestyle before baby comes. Would love some advice! 

Some crunchy things I do now: 
1. Follow a Westin A Price diet prioritizing organic nutrient dense food. Most of my diet is farmer‚Äôs market produce, full fat dairy, and beef/fish. 
2. Have all natural laundry detergent and surface cleaner. 
3. Replaced morning coffee with adrenal cocktails and matcha. 
4. Regularly exercise. I work at a gym so it used to be high intensity, but since my pregnancy started I‚Äôm now focused on low impact swimming/walking. I‚Äôm also a certified yoga instructor! 
5. Supplement magnesium and vitamin D, but I‚Äôve switched to a prenatal since conception. 
6. Planning a non medicated birth, but I‚Äôm too scared to go anywhere other than my hospital. Been trying to listen to podcasts that help empower me! 

Some things I need advice that I‚Äôm working on: 
1. Fragrance! I have multiple pets and I‚Äôm so worried about smelling musty, but I can‚Äôt switch to essential oils because it could harm my cat. 
2. Self care products. I‚Äôm rather frugal and don‚Äôt want to break the bank on all natural products. But I‚Äôm worried my shampoo/make up/skincare is toxic. My deodorant is Native which is better, but not the best. 
3. Sweets. My sweet tooth has been off the chart since becoming pregnant. I used to have processed sugar occasionally before but it was never a problem until now. Specifically baked goods and candy are my vice. 
4. General toxins. We filter our water with a simple Brita. Some things, like floor cleaner, I struggle to replace with a crunchy alternative out of fear of damaging our floors (we rent). Most of my clothing is polyester since again, i thrift and can‚Äôt afford to waste a bunch of money.
5. Baby registry. I‚Äôm from a Midwest traditional family who might not be willing to drop a bunch on wooden Montessori toys and would rather shower me with a multitude of plastic nonsense. What are your tips for my registry?

I haven't told you this, but I‚Äôve been carrying the shape of you in the broken puzzle pieces of my heart since long before I had a name or face to attach them to.

Not the fantasy of you. Not an idea of you. Just...you.

The real you.

The woman who second-guesses herself. Who carries the weight of the world, even when she doesn‚Äôt have to. Who gives endlessly, not out of obligation, but because she truly wants to. Who doesn‚Äôt realize how beautiful and strong she is, because somewhere along the way, someone told her she was ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù

But the truth is, you‚Äôre exactly what you need to be.

Through everything in my life, the heartbreaks, the loss, the laughter and the healing, I‚Äôve been learning how to love in a way that doesn‚Äôt shy away. A kind of love that doesn‚Äôt flinch. That doesn‚Äôt try to fix what isn‚Äôt broken. That stands firm. That holds space. That stays. And I‚Äôve reached a point in my life where I know this for certain: I don‚Äôt want to love halfway. I want the silences. The storms. The raw honesty. The emotional intensity. I want you. Unfiltered.

I want the ordinary days. The morning coffee, you in the sunlight, half-smiling, hair a mess but beautiful. The quiet on the couch as we talk about our day. The adventures both large and small. The new memories. The laughter we both didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd ever find again.

But I also want the heavy moments. The days when you feel like too much. Because to me you never will be. The days when the world takes more than it gives. Because to me, you‚Äôll always be just the right amount to want. I want to hold you tight when you can‚Äôt hold yourself together. To be the arms you fall into when the day breaks you down. To be your comfort, because you are also mine. To know your cracks not so that I can fix them but so that I can learn the places that the light gets in.

This isn‚Äôt about rushing. I'm not telling you I love you. Not yet. But I can see that being a future for the two of us. I'm just simply telling you the truth of where I am right now: I‚Äôve made space for someone who happens to be exactly like you. And the more I get to know you‚Ä¶the more pieces of you I find that feel like they fit the missing puzzle pieces of me broken off through the years of life and loss.

So don‚Äôt worry about being perfect. To me, you already are. Don‚Äôt worry about saying the right thing. I just want you to be you. And if you ever feel that quiet pull, that little voice that wonders: ‚ÄúCould it be that he really sees me? Could he really handle all of my emotional intensity?‚Äù I hope you know the answer.

Yes.

I do.

I can.

And I‚Äôm here.

1l7y9v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l7y9v9/i_dont_understand_why_i_cant_get_a_girlfriend_and/,I don't understand why I can't get a girlfriend and I feel like I'm falling behind.,"I'm a 23 year old guy. I'm tall, fit, I have a beard, I'm on my last year of studies, I have a nice job, I'm funny, I'm outgoing, I play sports, I do interesting stuff, I read, etc. I am however also bald so I see how that may be a hindrance.

If I meet a girl in a group setting, I can turn on the charm and I can land a date, but only if she's with me long enough to see my personality. When I'm out in a club, a bar, a coffee shop, anything like that, I can't even get a number. Whenever I do get a date, it doesn't work out because we live 200 miles apart or something like that.

I feel like I'm confident, however it is a bit of a hit to my ego when I'm out with my two friends and they get approached by girls pretty much every time. I wouldn't say I'm jealous, I love those guys, I'm happy for them. However, why not me, lol. I don't look particularly worse than either of them. I don't know if I'm missing some sort of natural charisma or whatever when I have my mouth closed.

I'm a horrible texter, but I'm really in my element in an environment where I get to talk. I rely a lot on my humor which only works through my tone and gestures. I'm great at telling stories, I'm great at getting along with anybody, making conversation around a table and just being the life of the party. 

I might sound like an arrogant asshole when I say I'm a total catch, but I don't care because I know it's true. I admit I am picky. However, I still don't get why it won't work out for me. I might be too burdened by it, but I truly feel like that's the only thing I'm missing in my life and it's something I'm truly craving and can't shake off. My friends like to tell me that ""it'll happen when you least expect it"" and I just hate hearing that because it isn't comforting at all. It most often comes from those that have been in relationships since they were 15.

I feel like the biggest reason for my frustration is the peer pressure. I'm at an age where a big chunk of my friends are moving in together, getting engaged, getting married. We were hanging out last weekend and one couple talked about the renovations in the apartment they're about to move into, another talked about a trip they took, a third one talked about their anniversary and what they're going to do. Meanwhile I'm here, stagnant and falling behind.

While I'm not lonely because I do have close friends and all that, I feel lonely because I don't have anyone I can share my struggles with without feeling embarrassed or anyone who can hug and comfort me when it's rough.

I truly don't understand what the issue is. To be clear, I do not blame women for my failures. They owe me nothing.

Feel free to ask any questions if you want me to elaborate on something more and then give to me like it is. Give me some advice to, if nothing else, help me make peace with the fact that nothing's going on.",1,1749560847.0,Advice,15,0.67,False

1l7y788,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1l7y788/explore_evenflo_pivot_suite_travel_system_review/,Explore Evenflo Pivot Suite Travel System Review Is It Worth the Hype?,"The Evenflo 54012455AZ Pivot Suite Travel System is a remarkable offering for parents seeking versatility and functionality in a stroller and car seat combination. Testing this product over a few weeks has given me plenty of opportunities to evaluate every feature it offers and also some areas where it could see improvement. This modular stroller system with its LiteMax Infant Car Seat and anti-rebound bar impressed me in many ways, offering a balance of smart design, ease of use, and safety for infants and toddlers alike.

**Ease of Use and Multimode Functionality**  
The pivoting versatility of this travel system really stands out. For instance, I found switching between the six modes of use, including infant car seat mode, lay-flat carriage mode, and toddler seat mode, incredibly intuitive. Each mode can be adjusted to either parent-facing or forward-facing, which came in handy when I wanted to keep my baby engaged or allow them to explore the surroundings. No tools are necessary for these switches; just a simple flip with the built-in seat swap adapter, and you're ready to go. Watching my niece seamlessly transition from car to stroller in the LiteMax Infant Car Seat without hassle was a major plus for family outings.  

[Check Evenflo 54012455AZ price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b0bljdgdwj/)

**Built for Comfort and Safety**  
The LiteMax Infant Car Seat is lightweight and pairs harmoniously with the stroller via the included adapter. While using it, I felt reassured knowing the base boasts an anti-rebound bar that helps absorb and dissipate crash forces, providing superior safety. The unit meets or exceeds federal safety standards, and it‚Äôs rollover-tested and side-impact tested, which only adds to its credibility. The spacious toddler seat accommodates a child up to 45 inches tall and up to 55 pounds, meaning it will grow with your baby for years. Whether I was navigating uneven paths or smoothly rolling over park trails, the rear suspension and cruiser tires offered excellent stability and comfort.  

**Storage Solutions and Accessories**  
I have to say, the large storage basket was a lifesaver! It easily fit a diaper bag, snacks, toys, and extra clothes. I loaded up the stroller on multiple busy errands around town, and the basket capacity didn‚Äôt disappoint. The included cup holder also feels like a thoughtful addition, though I occasionally wished for an extra one for my coffee. If you want to add more functionality, additional accessories like the Rider Board or Child Snack Tray are available for purchase, offering even more personalization for your needs.  

**Merits**  
- Modular design offers six versatile modes of use.  
- Lightweight car seat with excellent safety features, including an anti-rebound bar.  
- Rear suspension and cruiser tires ensure a smooth ride.  
- Generously sized storage basket with easy access.  
- Easy transitions between carriage, toddler seat, and car seat modes.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- It feels a bit heavy at 38 pounds when folding or lifting into the car.  
- The single cup holder might not meet all parents' needs.  
- Some might find the fabric choices limited, as the current option is Dunloe Black.  

**Competitive Options**  
In comparison to other travel systems in the market, for example, the Graco Modes Travel System, the Evenflo model surpasses in terms of flexibility. Graco‚Äôs system offers similar features but lacks the no-tools-required modular transformations found in the Evenflo system. On the other hand, the Baby Jogger City Mini GT2, while offering better off-road capabilities, doesn‚Äôt quite match the all-in-one functionality or storage solutions of this product. For parents who prioritize safety, the Evenflo car seat‚Äôs anti-rebound bar does give it an edge over many competitors that don‚Äôt include this feature.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Looking at the value proposition, this system strikes a solid price-to-quality ratio for the versatile features it offers. Busy parents will appreciate the multi-functionality, safety standards, and thoughtful design, which simpler systems often lack. Whether it‚Äôs for newborns or toddlers, this travel system accommodates different needs without breaking the bank, making it a smart investment over time.

I found the white (Yin Zhen silver needle) and oolong (Four Seasons Red) to be too subtle, yellow too vegetal, not a fan at all of the shou pu'erh i got. My favourite was the black (Dian Hong Ai Lao), I loved the red berry note in the smell of the dry leaves but found the taste to be a bit Yorkshire tea with the fruitiness being way in the background.

  
So - I am looking for a tea with really bold fruit-driven aroma, if that exists. As a point of comparison, my favourite types of coffee are super light roast funky tropical things.

He seems hella self-aware about it and he even says ""it depends on the person"". This tells me this is behavior he displays selectively, and I guess maybe I didnt do it for him as a personality? He says once he really trusts he lets loose and people would be amazed at how different he is. He is 31, had one gf way back in time and since then not a single interaction with a woman, dating was not even in the picture for him. Focusing on uni, career, status etc. He said he wants to try and form connections with women, develop a bond and have them give him advice, kind of like that feminine motherly figure. Tbh I was feeling he was very behind in basic communication skills or empathy. It seemed like those things never occurred for him and he was trying to learn it all now. I tried to be empathetic, understanding, help him open up, be there, and even though we had some moments of vulnerability and connection, the whole thing between us felt doomed af beyond repair.

I was sensing he liked me or at the very least grew to have some affinity towards me, somewhere between friendship and something more, but perhaps never enough to do anything about it. It's fine, I was enjoying even the fact that i had him in my life. He would make witty jokes, tease me, but never make any sort of advance. He would give compliments about ideas or things but never directed towards me as a woman to make it obvious he's taking interest in me. He would turn any of my hints or clues into jokes, laugh and brush it off.

As time was passing my feelings began intensifying, to the point of putting me on chokehold. I was  tormented with the intensity of what I felt and the overthinking on what to do about it was paralysing me. From nonsense friendly interactions to checking my phone whether he texted, fantasizing about him, thinking of spending more time together... But i also knew that all this may not mean shit to him... that I could just be a texting buddy for when he's bored and nothing more. Or that even if he did feel something, he is so blocked that it's impossible he would do anything to progress things. Feelings are very unexplored territory for him, he told me he doesnt do cute stuff. I could have the patience for someone i genuinely care for if i knew they needed more time to connect. Œíut if they genuinely dont have it in them???? It's beyond repair...

I decided to withdraw and pull my energy back cuz i felt so strongly about someone whom I genuinely didnt know how they felt... it started becoming a burden. He would say once in a blue moon that he appreciates my presence in his life and that he feels lucky to have me but wouldn't really see or acknowledge my feelings (or his own). He gets particularly sentimental only about specific topics that would strike a nerve, but other than that an impossible shell to break. I felt like being on a talent show and him being on the judging board and looking at me with the most stoic, straight, expressionless face. Nothing moves him or impresses him. Almost felt like he hates me deep down and he's just tolerating me. Tbh being a woman, I do receive attention from men, and whether genuine or not, they all treat me very kindly and warmly in their approach. To put it simply I receive attention that's effortless, getting offers for hangouts, dates, activities... he's the only person ive encountered who is this cold and insensitive. It seems abnormal to me, and tbh, not worth it of giving him the time of day. And even if they did feel the same, it's so complicated and unlikely that it would lead to anything... My enthusiasm, warmth, softness and companionship was probably not well-received... it was probably viewed as annoyance and irritation for him... suffocating him by doing too much. I never reached out again, and he just simply let it die out. No effort to reach out, check on me, ask if something's wrong... Zero interest. It baffles me. Casual, unbothered. 2-3 weeks of not talking and today he removed me from socials, unfriended, unfollowed.

We made plans earlier in May to go on a trip and spend time together during the summer (he suggested it) telling me if I ever come by his city pastries and coffee are his treat. Do you think he's a desensitised psycho or just removed me to regain control over his feelings? (assuming it affected him/meant something to begin with). Isn't it a bit crazy ""punishing"" someone because they wont accept your breadcrumbs? What drives me mad is that he implied he can be great if he chooses to, or jokingly saying ""depends"" who he gives hell to upon interaction... I cant help but think he just didnt like me enough. Im sure he must have had some minimum level of warmth or emotion for his ex, but didnt have it in him to try with me? I am very saddened by all this, but it's probably for the better i walked away and that it didnt lead anywhere.

07.06.2025, 17:00 Uhr

Dass Kaffee in Ma√üen gesundheitliche Vorteile bietet, ist kein Geheimnis. So soll das Getr√§nk bei regelm√§√üigem Konsum nicht nur das Risiko f√ºr Herz -Kreislauf-Erkrankungen senken, sondern auch Typ2-Diabetes vorbeugen k√∂nnen. Einer neuen Studie der Harvard Universit√§t in den USA zufolge soll regelm√§√üiger Kaffeegenuss bei Frauen zudem zu gesundem Altern ohne Demenz, Diabetes oder Krebs beitragen, wie unter anderem ‚ÄûBild.de‚Äú berichtet. Demnach w√ºrden bis zu 2,5 Tassen Kaffee pro Tag beim Erreichen eines Alters von 70+ ohne Ged√§chtnis- und Mobilit√§tsproblemen bei Frauen unterst√ºtzen.

F√ºr die Studie zog Studienleiterin Dr. Sara Mahdavi von der Harvard Universit√§t von 47.000 Frauen heran, die seit 1984 in regelm√§√üigen Abst√§nden Angaben zu ihrer Gesundheit, dem Lebensstil und der Ern√§hrung gemacht haben.

Ein bis zweieinhalb Tassen pro Tag f√∂rdern die Gesundheit

Jede Tasse Kaffee pro Tag steigert laut der Studie die Wahrscheinlichkeit, im Alter fit und geistig gesund zu bleiben um f√ºnf Prozent. Die empfohlene Maximalmenge von 2,5 Tassen pro Tag verbesserte dar√ºber hinaus allgemeine gesundheitliche Aspekte um zwei bis f√ºnf Prozent.

Bis 2016 erf√ºllten von den insgesamt 47.000 Frauen 3.700 alle Kriterien f√ºr ein gesundes Altern. Diese nahmen im Alter zwischen 45 und 60 Jahren 315 mg Koffein am Tag zu sich, was ungef√§hr drei Tassen Kaffee am Tag entspricht. Sie haben dabei rund 80 Prozent ihrer Koffeineinnahme √ºber Kaffee gedeckt.

Auf das Koffein im Kaffee kommt es an

Koffein aus anderen Getr√§nken wie Cola oder Energy Drinks hat dagegen keinen positiven Effekt auf gesundes Altern. Im Gegenteil: Bei einem Glas t√§glich davon sinkt die allgemeine Wahrscheinlichkeit f√ºr gesundes Altern um 19 Prozent. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, alle Kriterien f√ºr gesundes Altern zu erf√ºllen, also weder an Ged√§chtnis- noch an Mobilit√§tsproblemen oder an psychischen Problemen zu leiden, sank sogar um 25 Prozent.

Auch der Konsum von entkoffeiniertem Kaffee oder Tee k√∂nne keine √§hnlichen Auswirkungen f√ºr gesundes Altern erzielen wie Kaffee. ‚ÄûBild.de‚Äú zitiert die Studienleitern Dr. Mahdavi dazu: ‚ÄûDie Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass koffeinhaltiger Kaffee - im Gegensatz zu Tee oder entkoffeiniertem Kaffee - einzigartig den Alterungsprozess unterst√ºtzen kann, sodass geistige und k√∂rperliche Funktionen erhalten bleiben.‚Äú

## Key Features Analysis

The best rustic sofa tables combine durability, functionality, and aesthetic appeal. Let's examine the key features that contribute to a high-quality rustic sofa table.

**Material Quality:** The material used in construction is paramount to the durability and overall look of a rustic sofa table. Solid wood, such as reclaimed barn wood or distressed pine, is a popular choice. Though, high-quality wood veneers or engineered wood with realistic wood grain finishes can also provide a similar aesthetic at a more affordable price point. Metal accents, such as wrought iron or brushed steel, often complement the wood, adding to the rustic charm and structural integrity. The sturdiness and resistance to wear and tear depend heavily on the quality of these materials.

A rustic sofa table should be constructed from materials that not only look good but are also built to last. Reclaimed wood, as a notable example, offers a unique character and story, while solid pine provides a robust and reliable framework. Nonetheless of the specific materials used, the overall construction should be solid and well-crafted to withstand daily use.**storage Options:** Manny rustic sofa tables offer built-in storage solutions, adding to their functionality.These can include drawers for storing remote controls, magazines, or other small items; open shelves for displaying books or decorative objects; or even cabinets for concealing larger items. The type and amount of storage will depend on the specific design and intended use of the table.A well-designed storage solution can definitely help keep your living room clutter-free and organized.Consider the storage needs of your living space when selecting a rustic sofa table. do you need a place to store frequently used items, or are you primarily looking for display space? Some tables may offer a combination of both, allowing you to customize the storage to suit your needs.

**Dimensions and Size:** The size of the sofa table is a crucial factor to consider, as it needs to fit comfortably behind or beside your sofa without overwhelming the space. Measure the length of your sofa and the available space around it to determine the appropriate dimensions for the table.

## FAQs Section

**What are the best materials for a durable rustic sofa table?**

Solid wood, such as reclaimed barn wood, pine, or oak, is an excellent choice for a durable rustic sofa table. These materials are known for their strength, durability, and resistance to wear and tear. High-quality wood veneers or engineered wood with realistic wood grain finishes can also be a good option, offering a similar aesthetic at a more affordable price point. Metal accents, such as wrought iron or brushed steel, can further enhance the durability and stability of the table.

**How do I choose the right size sofa table for my living room?**

Measure the length of your sofa and the available space behind it to determine the appropriate length for the sofa table. The height of the table should be approximately the same as the back of your sofa or slightly lower. This will ensure a cohesive and balanced look in your living room. Also, consider the depth of the table to ensure it doesn't protrude too far into the room.

**How do I care for a rustic sofa table to keep it looking its best?**

Regularly dust the table with a soft,dry cloth to remove dirt and debris. For deeper cleaning, use a mild soap and water solution, and be sure to dry the table thoroughly afterward. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the finish. For wood tables, consider applying a wood polish or conditioner periodically to keep the wood moisturized and prevent cracking.

**Can I use a rustic sofa table in a modern or contemporary living room?**

Yes, a rustic sofa table can be a great addition to a modern or contemporary living room, adding a touch of warmth and character to the space. Though, it's significant to choose a table that complements the overall aesthetic of the room. Look for a rustic sofa table with clean lines and a minimalist design to avoid overwhelming the space. You can also incorporate other rustic elements into the room, such as throw pillows or artwork, to create a cohesive and balanced look.

1l7xwf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1l7xwf5/to_the_australian_dad_wearing_a_trucker_hat/,To the Australian dad wearing a trucker hat,"We shared a few days in the waiting room of a child psychology clinic. I‚Äôm the American dad who was always working on his laptop computer. I thought about telling you this in person, while we waited for our appointments, or leaving an anonymous note for the receptionist to pass along to you. But I chickened out. Too weird, I thought.

So here‚Äôs a totally-non-weird anonymous post on reddit. If anyone reading this thinks they know the Australian dad with a trucker hat, OR ANYONE ELSE THAT YOU THINK SHOULD HEAR THIS, please send it along.

I spent about twenty-two years raising two neurotypical kids. That‚Äôs twenty-two years of thinking I was a good dad. Not just a good dad, I thought, but above average. Sometimes I let myself think that I might even be a great dad. Now I know better.

For starters, I now know that I didn‚Äôt actually *raise* those two children at all. Typical kids basically raise themselves. I was *present* for much of the process. I provided the food and roof and car seats and ballet lessons and pediatrician co-pays and all the other raw materials and resources a kid needs to grow in our world. I didn‚Äôt screw up too badly, too many times. But the credit for making the journey to adulthood goes to the kids. Not me.

The reason I know better now is that I‚Äôm a dad again. This time to a kid who has special needs. A kid with difficult behavior problems, and with severe language and cognitive impairment. This kid will not raise herself. I have to be more than just *present*. I have to do *more* than supply the stability and raw materials.

I suppose this is obvious ‚Äì kids with more needs require more effort. But its the next part that, to me, is not obvious at all.¬† The kid doesn‚Äôt just need more ballet lessons and food and financial stability. The kid needs ‚Äì well, I don‚Äôt know. And its my job to know. Why don‚Äôt I know this yet? I did this twice already! The difficult truth is that I‚Äôm *not* a great dad. I never was. I didn‚Äôt learn whatever I was supposed to learn with the first two kids, and I don‚Äôt have a knack for this.

I‚Äôm in good company, though, because, in my opinion, most of us men with children are not masters at fatherhood. Our typical kids grow whether we want them to or not, in whatever direction they choose to go, barely influenced at all, it seems, by the direction we point them towards on the horizon of adulthood.

We all think we‚Äôre above average because most kids are typical kids (that‚Äôs what typical means, right? The thing that occurs most often) so we hardly ever encounter anyone who‚Äôs *had* to get good at parenting. We‚Äôre all like the high-school athlete who is competitive at the county level and thinks he‚Äôs world class.

But we can‚Äôt all be above average! Just look at the definition of average: it‚Äôs the line that half of us fall below. And for the half of dads who are above average, by however you choose to measure it, most of them just barely squeak past the median by a few inches. Dad-wise, most of us have never left the village for the big city. We have no idea what world-class fatherhood even looks like.

It looks like the guy I saw in the waiting room. The guy from Australia with the trucker hat. It looks like unlimited patience and love. It looks like knowing exactly what to do in the midst of a child‚Äôs struggle to deal with whatever horrible misfiring was happening in his young brain. It looks like someone who quietly ‚Äì without complaint or fanfare ‚Äì *deals* with any situation he finds in front of him. And who deals with his own limitations by breaking through to new levels of patience and understanding, again and again.

As I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôm picturing the Australian guy with the trucker hat finding this post. I hope it‚Äôs not too weird! I also hope you‚Äôre not mentally composing a rebuttal. Anyone can be a great parent, you might be thinking, in the waiting room of clinic of expert doctors. A place where everyone understands what you‚Äôre going through. A place where the staff can rush out and assist with melt-downs and tantrums.

If you‚Äôre an actual human being, you must have had moments you‚Äôre not proud of, when there were no experts around. Or anyone else to help you. When you had no idea what to do. When your patience lapsed and your frustration took over. We‚Äôve all had those bad moments. Yours are no worse than mine or anyone else‚Äôs. You are the sum of your best moments. Your worst don‚Äôt factor into it.

It will be Father‚Äôs Day soon. Around the world, millions of fathers will get ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Best Dad‚Äù coffee mugs and T-shirts and ties. I hope that someone gives you a ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Best Dad‚Äù coffee mug or tie because, in your case, that message is literally true. World‚Äôs. Best. Dad.",4,1749559804.0,GuyCry,1,1.0,False

He seems hella self-aware about it and he even says ""it depends on the person"". This tells me this is behavior he displays selectively, and I guess maybe I didnt do it for him as a personality? He says once he really trusts he lets loose and people would be amazed at how different he is. He is 31, had one gf way back in time and since then not a single interaction with a woman, dating was not even in the picture for him. Focusing on uni, career, status etc. He said he wants to try and form connections with women, develop a bond and have them give him advice, kind of like that feminine motherly figure. Tbh I was feeling he was very behind in basic communication skills or empathy. It seemed like those things never occurred for him and he was trying to learn it all now. I tried to be empathetic, understanding, help him open up, be there, and even though we had some moments of vulnerability and connection, the whole thing between us felt doomed af beyond repair.

I was sensing he liked me or at the very least grew to have some affinity towards me, somewhere between friendship and something more, but perhaps never enough to do anything about it. It's fine, I was enjoying even the fact that i had him in my life. He would make witty jokes, tease me, but never make any sort of advance. He would give compliments about ideas or things but never directed towards me as a woman to make it obvious he's taking interest in me. He would turn any of my hints or clues into jokes, laugh and brush it off.

As time was passing my feelings began intensifying, to the point of putting me on chokehold. I was  tormented with the intensity of what I felt and the overthinking on what to do about it was paralysing me. From nonsense friendly interactions to checking my phone whether he texted, fantasizing about him, thinking of spending more time together... But i also knew that all this may not mean shit to him... that I could just be a texting buddy for when he's bored and nothing more. Or that even if he did feel something, he is so blocked that it's impossible he would do anything to progress things. Feelings are very unexplored territory for him, he told me he doesnt do cute stuff. I could have the patience for someone i genuinely care for if i knew they needed more time to connect. Œíut if they genuinely dont have it in them???? It's beyond repair...

I decided to withdraw and pull my energy back cuz i felt so strongly about someone whom I genuinely didnt know how they felt... it started becoming a burden. He would say once in a blue moon that he appreciates my presence in his life and that he feels lucky to have me but wouldn't really see or acknowledge my feelings (or his own). He gets particularly sentimental only about specific topics that would strike a nerve, but other than that an impossible shell to break. I felt like being on a talent show and him being on the judging board and looking at me with the most stoic, straight, expressionless face. Nothing moves him or impresses him. Almost felt like he hates me deep down and he's just tolerating me. Tbh being a woman, I do receive attention from men, and whether genuine or not, they all treat me very kindly and warmly in their approach. To put it simply I receive attention that's effortless, getting offers for hangouts, dates, activities... he's the only person ive encountered who is this cold and insensitive. It seems abnormal to me, and tbh, not worth it of giving him the time of day. And even if they did feel the same, it's so complicated and unlikely that it would lead to anything... My enthusiasm, warmth, softness and companionship was probably not well-received... it was probably viewed as annoyance and irritation for him... suffocating him by doing too much. I never reached out again, and he just simply let it die out. No effort to reach out, check on me, ask if something's wrong... Zero interest. It baffles me. Casual, unbothered. 2-3 weeks of not talking and today he removed me from socials, unfriended, unfollowed.

We made plans earlier in May to go on a trip and spend time together during the summer (he suggested it) telling me if I ever come by his city pastries and coffee are his treat. Do you think he's a desensitised psycho or just removed me to regain control over his feelings? (assuming it affected him/meant something to begin with). Isn't it a bit crazy ""punishing"" someone because they wont accept your breadcrumbs? What drives me mad is that he implied he can be great if he chooses to, or jokingly saying ""depends"" who he gives hell to upon interaction... I cant help but think he just didnt like me enough. Im sure he must have had some minimum level of warmth or emotion for his ex, but didnt have it in him to try with me? I am very saddened by all this, but it's probably for the better i walked away and that it didnt lead anywhere.

I live in a very soft water area - its basically filtered water straight out of my taps (25ppm last time I checked).

As such I only deep clean my coffee machines every 4-6 months.  

Today I ran my usual deep clean which involves putting coffee machine cleaner in the water tank, running it, let it stand for 5-10 mins, run again then rinse several times usually about 2 full tanks of fresh.

After I have done this I always check the water coming out of the machines and my other 2 machines were fine but my aldi ambiano is throwing out weird black flecks from the steam wand only.  The group head is clear.  
Anyone got any ideas?

But today, weeks after my last cup of nespresso, it was absolutely gross, bitter, somehow dry, utterly undrinkable (for me). Took a few sips and poured it down the drain. The utterly gross taste lingered in my mouth until i went home and made another coffee.

Is it over? Am I doomed to forever use go cups with my own coffee in the office? I guess so, lol. Might need to stash a second stealth espresso setup somewhere in the office.",14,1749559498.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

five months later, we finally met when i had to visit university for some documentation. he was posted in his hometown now. when he noticed i was there, he immediately asked to meet. i always thought we would meet somewhere casually and have a great time. but he only talked about hookup. i wasn't staying alone and asked him if we could meet over coffee cause that's what i wanted. and he agreed. the meeting was nice. 

anyways after our meeting, i went back. but it was only silence from him even though we had snapchat streaks going. i don't know why but i realized i had deep feelings for him. waited for his response for two week. still nothing. i finally texted him myself. and he said he was eagerly waiting to meet again.

i visited again a few weeks later. he again asked for a place for hookup. which i didn't have. then he made plans to meet over coffee and disappeared. but when he saw my streak of going back, he was crying in dms about how badly he wanted to meet. he said he was missing me and what not. 

i visited again. and then same conversation about hookup. made plans himself for taking me out. i waited and again he disappeared. i had the worst panic attack of my life. i finally decided to remove him cause pain was just unbearable. and silence was eating me alive.

i removed him from everything. he tried approaching again after a whole month but i didn't respond. 6-7 month later, he approached again. i hoped he would say something. he didn't and i just protected myself from confrontation or maybe i still had feeling and i simply kept contact on whatsapp. 

this year in feb, he was in my hometown for work. he approached a month earlier how he was coming and wanted to meet. and he confirmed thrice in between before meeting. we finally slept for the first time. and then he disappeared again for a whole month. this time it was even more painful. i blocked him everywhere. he tried approaching again on insta and i just sent a long message on how he had hurt me and blocked him.

i don't know why i can not let go of the attachment. i keep thinking maybe i was impatient or asking for too much. or maybe existing in his orbit would have helped. but nothing seems to console me. and i have only been second guessing my decision to block him. and i even cringe at the message i sent, thinking he probably laughed it off.",2,1749559451.0,ghosting,6,1.0,False

Took her out to restaurants, we wanted to introduce her to the variety of food we have! No, no sushi, no Thai food, no Chinese, because Italian food is the best! We went out for Italian 3 days in a row! She complained about pasta, about cheese, anything is just not as good as in ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Italy

She came, and the first thing she said was, your house smell bad (fish sauce), and she proceeded to ignore my dish and asked my husband to take her out for some lasagna!

I was so mad and did not mince words, I told her how arrogant and obnoxious to think Italian food are the best, told her Italian are not the best, and we would not take her out for any Italian meals, she could go shopping for herself, cooked it, and enjoyed alone, sorry but the ingredients would not be‚Ä¶.as good as in‚Ä¶..

I decided to withdraw and pull my energy back cuz i felt so strongly about someone whom I genuinely didnt know how they felt... it started becoming a burden. He would say once in a blue moon that he appreciates my presence in his life and that he feels lucky to have me but wouldn't really see or acknowledge my feelings (or his own). He gets particularly sentimental only about specific topics that would strike a nerve, but other than that an impossible shell to break. I felt like being on a talent show and him being on the judging board and looking at me with the most stoic, straight, expressionless face. Nothing moves him or impresses him. Almost felt like he hates me deep down and he's just tolerating me. Tbh being a woman, I do receive attention from men, and whether genuine or not, they all treat me very kindly and warmly in their approach. To put it simply I receive attention that's effortless, getting offers for hangouts, dates, activities... he's the only person ive encountered who is this cold and insensitive. It seems abnormal to me, and tbh, not worth it of giving him the time of day. And even if they did feel the same, it's so complicated and unlikely that it would lead to anything... My enthusiasm, warmth, softness and companionship was probably not well-received... it was probably viewed as annoyance and irritation for him... suffocating him by doing too much. I never reached out again, and he just simply let it die out. No effort to reach out, check on me, ask if something's wrong... Zero interest. It baffles me. Casual, unbothered. 2-3 weeks of not talking and today he removed me from socials, unfriended, unfollowed.

We made plans earlier in May to go on a trip and spend time together during the summer (he suggested it) telling me if I ever come by his city pastries and coffee are his treat. Do you think he's a desensitised psycho or just removed me to regain control over his feelings? (assuming it affected him/meant something to begin with). Isn't it a bit crazy ""punishing"" someone because they wont accept your breadcrumbs? What drives me mad is that he implied he can be great if he chooses to, or jokingly saying ""depends"" who he gives hell to upon interaction... I cant help but think he just didnt like me enough. Im sure he must have had some minimum level of warmth or emotion for his ex, but didnt have it in him to try with me? I am very saddened by all this, but it's probably for the better i walked away and that it didnt lead anywhere.

Or something more serious?,"About 2 days ago I noticed some chest tightness from breathing and thought it was from vaping (I already quit once and Im quitting again) and I told myself it would be gone soon since Im in the middle of my quitting progress

Then Im starting to notice that it wasn't just from breathing, but also swallowing, and it is so noticeable when I'm drinking water

It's like the feeling of when you bit a big chunk of food without chewing it well then swallowing

It's getting really uncomfortable now since it's not going away 

I will also add that I also experience the typical acid reflux (stomach ache and burping a lot)

Im not even sure if this is what heartburn feels like. And I consistently feel the tightness. I feel it on my sternum. No tightness on my lungs. Also no sharp pain or anything like that. Just tightness and discomfort.

Im planning to go to the doctor soon but Im stuck in the middle of deadlines, and I'm also unsure of how I would describe this

I also couldn't think of what caused this and when it actually started but I do remember a few things:

*Nasal spray (might have used too much?)
*swallowing vitamins two/three at a time
*double shot coffee (not everyday)
*eating too much food (I weigh normal)

1l7xorc,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1l7xorc/morning_meditation/,Morning Meditation,"I woke up this morning feeling unsettled. Anxious, a dull ache in my stomach. I turned my face sideways on the pillow, cradling my arms around myself, trying to stretch out. Trying to stop the growing feeling of unease building.

My husband was next to me, face turned up to the sky like a vampire. Snoring. *Sawing logs* I thought, remembering a description I've heard for snoring before. I could see his heart beating through his skin. I felt a sudden need to hug him, to pull him towards me with my right arm. Feeling something as I did, whatever I was holding onto in my chest and my lungs, like a liquid release.

I closed my eyes, the dream that woke me up swirling around still in pieces. *I died* I suddenly remembered. The pull of leaving my body, seeing it on the ground. A hallway of white, moving through it. Talking, but it was more like thinking thoughts that I knew were not my own. I laid on my stomach for a while, just letting it all settle. Trying to pull and hold onto what I was remembering, what I was dreaming.

By the time I sat up, swung my legs off the bed and started walking towards the bathroom, it was gone.

We divided and conquered in the morning with the girls like we always do. Like every morning, I kissed their little faces, their eyelashes impossibly long. Trying to wake them both up, gently. It was still really early. We always had to get them up so early. During the school year, everything was rushed. I used to wonder what it was doing to all of us, the adrenaline coursing, trying to just get in the car and go. Needing to be on time all four of us, in different places. Our lives connected but separate.

We brushed their teeth, changed them into clean clothes. Carried them downstairs and into the car.

Matteo kissed me after I kissed and hugged both girls in their car seats. A quick peck on the lips. The sun was starting to rise in the sky to the east and south over his shoulder. We hugged then too, feeling the gentle light start to warm us both. Knowing that the day that was unfolding was going to get hot, harsh. *We're not able to hold onto anything* I thought, even the gentle morning sun. *We never get to just feel* I thought, sadly. An image in my head as Matteo's arms held me, of the two of us, drinking coffee and watching the water on a swing on the back deck. Life unfolding as we watched and let it instead of jumping into the current and swimming for our lives through it. We're in this together even though it's felt so lonely sometimes. Both of us, feeling the weight of responsibility like we felt gravity. There and not more than we can handle, but ceaseless. Cloying. Like a heavy blanket that was welcome until all at once you feel too hot. Smothered. Parenting like driving a car and never being able to take your eyes off the road even if sometimes you coast. Yard work. House work. Building a business. Together and separate.

He let go of me and walked to the driver's side, pulling it open and settling in. I realized I had my arms wrapped around myself as I watched them drive away, thinking about the fluctuations of time and life. The things that were so important ten years ago not even being a distant memory. More like the memories you have when you're busy working on something and something bubbles up into your mind. Adjacent to your thoughts. Related somehow, maybe through the current scent around, something someone said. Not really mattering anymore. Like they happened to someone else, somewhere else.

The girls were arguing with each other as the car rolled down the driveway. I could hear it ""Mine, that's mine!"" pulling a stuffed animal back and forth. I loved them both like breathing. Ceaseless and painful sometimes. Always wondering if I'm doing, saying, being the right thing. They are a part of me now, maybe they always were. There, attached to my body, unseen, unheard, unable to be felt. But there. *My babies*.

I walked through the backyard, knowing that I had work to start. Coffee to drink. People and things to respond to. *I'm so tired* I thought, noticing the beach house in the back needed so much work. Wondering if I could take off for a couple of days and do it myself. I love home projects, even when I don't always do the best job. *I try my freaking best,* I think. Wondering what kind of courage it takes to actually stop caring about what other people think. Wondering if I want to fix things up and make them beautiful for myself, or for someone else.

The lake churned and turned, small beautiful ripples. I found a spot and stared at it, the waves dancing, everywhere. *How and when does it become still* I wondered, this body of water that I've watched my whole life. Changing in color, reach, movement, but still, always the lake. Never changing in definition at least in my lifetime. Birds in the distance and above my head. I wondered if they noticed me or if I was just there to them. Part of the background, as they searched for food as they soared. *Do they have fun* I wondered. It looked like fun, soaring and screaming. Over the beautiful water, other birds flying next to them. *Do they feel as free as they look from the ground*? Maybe they were trapped in their own thoughts too. The constant, interrupting jangle. *I wonder what it's like to stop wondering* I thought.

There was a piece of driftwood in front of me, white and sun bleached. Remembering sitting on this exact log a few years ago after my dad passed away. Watching the birds and thinking he was one of them after a while. Thinking if he could be or do anything it would probably be that. Somewhere, remembering the feeling of flapping my own wings, the wind over and through them. I closed my eyes then and just sat for a long time. Knowing somewhere, somehow what it was like to ride the wind. Feeling a freedom I've only gotten as a kid when I would run over the rocks next to beach, sprinting, jumping from one to the next with solid, sure feet. The thought that I wouldn't land never even crossed my mind. My heart pumping, beating in my chest, my body moving in one solid, fluid motion.

I don't remember the last time I moved like that.

Eventually I sat on the log in the same spot I did those years before, wondering if the waves had taken it out at one point and brought it back in. Not remembering seeing it last year on the beach those times when we'd all sat down there, making smores next to a fire.

Still feeling shaky, unsettled. I inhaled to the count of four, then held it. *One, two, three, four* beating, repeating. I exhaled out of my nose, closing my eyes. Just letting myself be.",1,1749559198.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

1l7xmyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1l7xmyj/aio_over_my_sons_birthday_going_unacknowledged/,AIO over my son's birthday going unacknowledged?,"So I'm part of a baby group, one of those that you get matched up based on due dates and do pregnancy classes together, then it's over to you to maintain a relationship with each other.

There are 7 mums in this group, including me. One left it very shortly after all our babies were born (but still lurks in the chat where we share photos, which is a different uncomfortable story), meaning 6 of us, including me, plus our husbands. We've stayed pretty close as a group, doing weekly coffee afternoons throughout everyone's mat leave.

I'm close friends with 2 in the group and only see the others at parties, but we've all seen each other recently as all our babies are turning 1 now, so we've all been having the first birthday parties.

My son is the youngest in the group, it's his birthday today and the next youngest was 10 days ago. He was meant to have his party with all the babies in this group this Saturday just gone, but we've had to delay for a few weeks due to a potential chickenpox outbreak amongst the group (there was an older baby guest at one of the other babies birthdays that came out in the pox afterwards, but we were away on holiday so didn't make that party). My point is that they know his birthday is around now due to them all being invited to the party and us all voting on a new date last week for July etc.

I made a point of putting all of their baby's birthdays in my phone calendar last year after my son was born, in the hopes we'd all still be talking a year later. Well here we are and out of the other 5 babies, I've been the first one to birthday message in the chat for 4 of them - my friend got there first by about half an hour for one. So far today, nothing's been said for my son. Not that I'm tracking, but all the other birthday messages were sent before 8 am, as is the way with mothers of young babies.

Out of all the friends that I had before I had my son, I'm the only one with a kid, so I'm not expecting messages from most of the people in my life. My family have messaged, and one of my old friends has, but no one else has and like that's fine. I'm not expecting my kid to be the center of their Tuesday. But my BABY group where the literal point of our meeting was because we were all having babies at the same time? I'm kind of disappointed that he's not getting the same love everyone else got.

I know I'm obviously just the one that's been the most organised with their calendar, that my messages have reminded everyone else and they jumped on board and it's nothing personal, but friend 1 said during a playdate a few weeks ago ""oh it's baby X's birthday next week"", so I know she keeps track, and friend 2 was the one who beat me to the punch with the message before. So I kind of thought one of them at least would start the message ball rolling?

I also know that we're all in the thick of it with our babies and work and stuff, and if I didn't have the calendar reminders set up, I would have remembered precisely 1 of their birthdays and only because it's shared with an old friend of mine. So I'm really not taking anything personally and I totally understand everyone's got their thing going on, I'm just feeling a bit left out I guess?

Obviously my son hasn't got a clue, but on my end I've kept him alive earthside for a full year and I'm now also one year postpartum. Like I'm remembering ""this time last year my waters broke, this time last year my contractions started, this time last year I held him for the first time"" etc. If you've had a baby, you know the first birthday is as much a memorial for your labour as it is a celebration for your child. My labour was untraumatic medically, but it's still a poignant moment and a physiological trauma regardless that's meaningful, y'know? And all of us mamas in the group get that and the birthday messages we've been sending have been as much an acknowledgement of that side of things as it is a happy birthday to the baby.

So yeah, idk. I'm feeling a bit blue at the radio silence, but don't want to put anything in the group as it'll seem passive aggressive... But then everyone else shared their birthday moments because they were in response to the messages, and now I can't share my son's because no one's messaged? Or can I put photos in the chat without it coming across passive aggressive? I feel like it'll seem aggy no matter what I do. I was raised big on etiquette which is part of my disappointment over this all, but is also crippling me sharing my son's birthday joy with the ONLY group of people I have who get it (again, child free friends only outside of this group of mum friends).

If nothing else, I thought I'd be able to share some birthday joy with friend 1 and 2, but again, I feel like I can't message them without it making them feel bad for forgetting? Or coming across like I'm trying to do that? And I really don't want anyone to feel bad, I'm not THAT upset, just feeling a bit lonely I guess. I just want to share my only kid's first birthday with my friends is all.

So am I overreacting because no one in the group has remembered my son's first birthday? Please be gentle, my son is not a sleeper and I'm still only getting about 3-4 broken hours of sleep a night. The emotional dysregulation is real.

TIA x

Sorry ETA: I should have said, I quietly mentioned my disappointment to one of my childfree friends and they sort of implied I shouldn't feel ANY kind of way about it because everyone's busy with their own lives. Which, I know, but I still feel something over it y'know? I've got a great cupcake moment where my son is so, so joyful and I want to share it with my parent friends but can't, y'know?

Update for anyone interested:

Thank you for those of you who were kind and gentle even if you thought I was over-reacting, I really appreciate you being respectful to a tired and emotional stranger on the internet ‚ù§Ô∏è

I took the advice of many and shared the cupcake joy photos with the group chat and everyone's now flooding in with the birthday messages and love. In an ideal world, he'd have been remembered but the MOST important thing is that my husband and I get to share our joy and happiness and overwhelming love for our son on this very special day with our parent group who get it ü•∞

Seriously thank you to those who encouraged me to send the photos, if I'd been left to my own devices I would have seen that as way too passive aggressive to do and the day probably would have passed without acknowledgement. It doesn't seem like anyone's taken anything badly AND we get to acknowledge my son's birthday, which is the best of all worlds so thank you again, kind redditors ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,1749559054.0,AmIOverreacting,13,0.73,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best Polo sweatpants of 2025 boast a range of features designed to enhance comfort,performance,and style. Understanding these features is crucial for selecting a pair that meets your specific needs and preferences.

**Material Composition:**

The material composition substantially impacts the comfort and durability of sweatpants. Most polo sweatpants are made from a blend of cotton and polyester. The cotton provides softness and breathability, while the polyester adds durability and helps maintain the garment's shape. High-quality blends often feature a higher cotton content (e.g., 80% cotton, 20% polyester) for enhanced comfort. Some premium options may incorporate materials like French Terry for added plushness or performance fabrics with moisture-wicking properties. The specific composition is usually outlined on the garment's label and should be considered based on your intended use.

**Waistband and Drawstring:**

The waistband and drawstring are key components for ensuring a secure and comfortable fit. Polo sweatpants typically feature an elastic waistband, which provides flexibility and ease of movement. The drawstring allows for adjustability, ensuring a snug fit around the waist. High-quality drawstrings are often made from durable materials and feature reinforced eyelets to prevent fraying or tearing. Some premium models may incorporate a wider waistband for added support and comfort, preventing digging or rolling during wear.

**Pockets and Storage:**

Pockets are essential for practicality, providing convenient storage for small items like phones, keys, or wallets. Polo sweatpants generally feature side seam pockets, which are integrated into the side seams of the pants. Some models may also include a back pocket, usually on the right side. Deeper pockets are appreciated for their ability to securely hold larger items. High-quality pockets are frequently enough reinforced at the stress points to prevent tearing or stretching.

**Leg Style and Cuff:**

the leg style and cuff design contribute to the overall look and feel of the sweatpants. Polo sweatpants are available in various leg styles, including straight leg, tapered leg, and jogger styles. Straight-leg styles offer a classic, relaxed fit, while tapered leg styles provide a more modern, streamlined silhouette. Jogger styles feature elastic cuffs at the ankles, creating a sporty and secure fit.High-quality cuffs are typically made from ribbed fabric that provides stretch and maintains its shape over time.

**Embroidered Logo Detail:**

The embroidered Polo logo is a signature detail that adds a touch of brand recognition and visual appeal. The logo is usually located on the left thigh, typically near the pocket.

1l7xkpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuillandPen/comments/1l7xkpt/the_sway_of_a_park/,The Sway of a Park,"# The Sway of a Park

A squirrel darted down the thick trunk of an old oak, its sharp claws tapping against the bark as it spiraled in pursuit of a sibling. The two twisted and bounded across branches, leaping from limb to limb in their chaotic ballet. Though alert and attuned to motion, the squirrel, like most of its kind, was cursed with poor eyesight. It sensed the world more than it saw it. So it did not notice the rising steel skeletons and cranes encroaching on its arboreal playground, nor did it understand the vibrations in the earth or the distant groans of machines.

To the squirrel, the ground was still soft with grass, the branches still ripe with acorns. It was safe. So it continued to play.

In those early years, the park was a curiosity ‚Äî a preserved oasis in the center of ambition. The building sprouted around it like a castle wall growing from the soil, tier upon tier of concrete, glass, and ambition. At the heart of the complex, untouched by construction crews save for a few carefully paved paths, the park remained green. It was the private domain of the building's original owner ‚Äî a man of deep pockets and simple pleasures. He had the grass mowed in neat waves and retained a ring of native trees around a koi pond to keep the sun off his bald scalp. Gardeners were paid well to make the place look as if no hand had ever touched it.

The squirrels adapted. They nested in the tall trees that still stood like veterans of a forgotten battle, growing accustomed to the hum of elevators and the faint scent of imported coffee drifting from executive windows. They were watched from afar by suits behind tinted glass, who sometimes paused mid-conference call to observe a fuzzy tail dart across a branch.

When the man passed, the building changed hands. His children, pragmatic and less romantic, eyed the park not as a sanctuary, but as potential. To maintain appearances and create a tax shelter, they opened it as a private garden for residents. Paths of crushed pebble were laid down. Benches were installed. The squirrels, ever adaptive, watched from the treetops as humans began to walk and jog among their roots. Some of them ‚Äî especially the smaller ones ‚Äî brought food: crumbs, crusts, bits of fruit. The squirrels grew bolder. One learned to sit on a bench‚Äôs backrest, pawing the air until it was fed. Others followed.

The park flourished. The owners had discovered that green spaces sold apartments. They planted more trees, hardy ones with wide canopies. The squirrel population doubled and then tripled. Pigeons came and left. Cats roamed briefly, then disappeared. The squirrels stayed.

They shared their world with butterflies ‚Äî creatures of dizzying grace and inscrutable intent. Monarchs visited in migration waves, orange banners on whispering wings. The squirrels didn‚Äôt bother with them. They were too unpredictable. Too light.

Time, that patient vandal, wore down the luster of the high-rise. The economy shifted. The rich moved out, lured by newer buildings and views less boxed in. The children sold the property to a holding company that specialized in low-rent housing. Maintenance slipped. Paint chipped. Elevators stalled. The grass in the park grew tall, then wild. Trash collected in corners. Pebbled paths cracked and vanished beneath thistle and creeping vines. One tree was felled by lightning and left where it fell. The park was no longer advertised. Tenants were warned not to enter it at night.

The squirrels did not mind.

Without the humans, the park returned to a different kind of order. The weeds were tall but bore seeds. The trash bags were a buffet. Birds nested in the holes of trees that no one trimmed. The butterfly numbers dipped, driven away by fumes and the absence of milkweed, but the squirrels endured. The sway of the park shifted. It was no longer a manicured centerpiece. It was a refuge from humans, from noise, from light.

Children peered at it from rusted balconies. Sometimes they threw rocks, but even that grew rare.

Then, one day, the machines came again.

The building was sold once more, this time to a private investment firm with a vision. And a budget. Renovation crews arrived like ants ‚Äî purposeful, tireless, unsettling. Walls were resurfaced. Elevators replaced. Apartments gutted and modernized. The old maintenance man who had kept the boilers limping was replaced with a team wearing matching polos. The tenants changed, too. Slowly, at first. Then, in a rush.

And once again, eyes turned toward the park.

The groundskeepers were careful. Some trees were trimmed, others replaced with younger, ornamental varieties. The grass was cut and then reseeded. Benches returned, modern and metal. Trails were widened and lined with smooth stones. A playground rose in one corner with blue slides and a plastic seesaw shaped like a frog.

And in the center, they planted milkweed.

They hadn‚Äôt meant to call back the Monarchs. It was simply a nod to eco-friendliness, a bullet point on a brochure. But the butterflies returned anyway, like a forgotten debt come due. They flitted above the flowerbeds, drifting past strollers and yoga mats.

The squirrel bounded from the oak. It knew this place. It knew this spot, beneath this branch, was where food could be found. Its nose twitched at the familiar scent of roasted peanuts in a paper cup. It did not see the child giggling from the sandbox, or the older couple on the bench smiling and pointing.

It only understood that it was safe; that the breeze through the trees was gentle and that the air smelled sweet with blooms and bark.

Nearby, a butterfly landed on a flower.

Then another.

Then a dozen more.

The park was alive in a way that defied history, neither the manicured showpiece of the rich nor the neglected jungle of the poor. It was something in between. Something organic. Something that remembered all the versions of itself and still swayed forward.

A dog barked. A child laughed. A squirrel skittered toward a half-eaten granola bar.

Take, for instance, the time my aunt and I were invited to a Sunday morning pancake breakfast at the home of some mutual friends. We rode over together and arrived at what turned out to be the fanciest pancake breakfast I‚Äôve ever attended‚Äîbefore or since.

We were ushered through a lovely home into a formal dining room, where a massive oak pedestal table commanded the center of the space, draped in a snowy white tablecloth. The table was set with beautiful china, polished silverware, and gleaming glassware. A colorful bouquet in a crystal vase completed the look. It was the kind of setup that told me in no uncertain terms that this was not going to be your average pancake breakfast shindig.

After some polite mingling, breakfast was announced: not just pancakes, but a full spread of sumptuous morning delights. Eggs, fruit, baked goods, breakfast meats‚Äîbasically, everything an elegant breakfast party needs short of a string quartet.

We took our seats, coffee was poured, orange juice glasses were filled, and serving plates and platters were passed around.

That‚Äôs when the table decided to make a break for it.

I can only guess that the table's casters must have been recently oiled. The table shot out across the room like a car from the starting line at the Indy 500.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a suitable o-ring for a Zacconi boiler cap hinges on several key features. These features directly impact the o-ring's performance, lifespan, and its capability to withstand the specific demands of an espresso machine.

**Material Composition:** The material of the o-ring determines its heat resistance, chemical compatibility, and overall durability. Silicone, Viton (FKM), and EPDM are common choices, each offering distinct advantages. Silicone provides excellent flexibility and good heat resistance, typically up to 400¬∞F (200¬∞C), suitable for many espresso machine applications. Viton offers superior resistance to chemicals, oils, and high temperatures, generally up to 450¬∞F (232¬∞C), making it a premium option for demanding environments. EPDM is known for its excellent water resistance and is a cost-effective choice, even though it may not be as resistant to high temperatures or oils as Viton.**Durometer (Hardness):** Durometer measures the hardness of the o-ring, typically rated on the Shore A scale. A lower durometer indicates a softer, more pliable o-ring, while a higher durometer signifies a harder, more rigid o-ring. For Zacconi boiler caps, a durometer between 60 and 70 Shore A is usually ideal. This range provides a good balance between sealing capability and ease of installation, allowing the o-ring to compress effectively without being overly difficult to fit.

**Inner Diameter (ID) and Cross-Section (CS):** Accurate dimensions are critical for a proper seal. The inner diameter (ID) must precisely match the diameter of the surface the o-ring is sealing against, while the cross-section (CS) dictates how much the o-ring compresses to create the seal. For Zacconi boiler caps, specific ID and CS measurements are required to ensure a snug and leak-proof fit. Incorrect dimensions can lead to leaks or difficulty in securing the boiler cap. Ensure to consult your Zacconi's documentation or measure the existing o-ring with a precise caliper.

**Temperature Range:** The o-ring must withstand the high temperatures generated within the espresso machine's boiler. Look for o-rings rated for continuous operation at temperatures exceeding the typical operating range of your Zacconi. Silicone o-rings generally handle temperatures up to 400¬∞F (200¬∞C), while Viton o-rings can withstand temperatures up to 450¬∞F (232¬∞C) or even higher in specialized formulations. Choosing an o-ring with a sufficient temperature rating is crucial for preventing premature degradation and failure.

**Chemical Resistance:** Espresso machines use various cleaning solutions and descalers that can potentially degrade o-rings over time. Opt for o-rings made from materials resistant to these chemicals. Viton o-rings are excellent in this regard, offering superior resistance to acids, bases, and oils commonly found in espresso machine maintenance products. Silicone and EPDM o-rings exhibit varying degrees of resistance, so it's essential to check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure compatibility with your cleaning regimen.Key features to keep in mind:

* Correct Material: Viton, Silicone, or EPDM
* Precise Dimensions: Accurate inner Diameter (ID) and Cross-Section (CS)
* Appropriate Durometer: 60-70 Shore A is generally ideal
* High-Temperature Resistance: must withstand boiler temperatures
* Chemical Compatibility: Resistant to cleaning solutions

## Core Benefits

Selecting the right o-ring for your Zacconi boiler cap provides numerous benefits, ensuring the longevity and optimal performance of your cherished espresso machine.

**Leak Prevention:** A properly sized and appropriately materialed o-ring creates a tight, leak-proof seal, preventing water or steam from escaping the boiler. This is crucial for maintaining consistent pressure within the boiler, which directly impacts the quality and consistency of your espresso shots. Leaks can lead to pressure loss, resulting in weak or inconsistent brews. An optimal o-ring ensures the boiler cap sits securely and seals effectively,guaranteeing consistent pressure levels for perfect espresso every time.

**Extended Machine Lifespan:** Using a high-quality o-ring protects the boiler and surrounding components from corrosion and damage caused by leaks. Water and steam escaping from a faulty seal can corrode metal parts over time, leading to costly repairs or even irreversible damage to the machine.Investing in a durable, chemically resistant o-ring helps prevent these problems, substantially extending the lifespan of your Zacconi espresso machine.

**Improved Espresso Quality:** Consistent boiler pressure, achieved through a secure and leak-proof seal, is essential for extracting the full flavor and aroma from your coffee grounds. Pressure fluctuations caused by leaks can negatively affect the brewing process, leading to under-extraction or over-extraction, both of which compromise the taste and quality of your espresso. by maintaining stable pressure, the correct o-ring ensures that your espresso is consistently rich, flavorful, and perfectly balanced.**Reduced Maintenance Frequency:** A high-quality o-ring, especially one made from durable materials like Viton, is less likely to degrade or fail prematurely. This translates to fewer replacements and less frequent maintenance, saving you time and money in the long run. Choosing a reliable o-ring minimizes the risk of unexpected leaks and pressure drops, allowing you to enjoy your Zacconi espresso machine without constant worry about maintenance.

Viton (FKM) o-rings are generally the best choice for their superior performance and durability in espresso machine applications, while silicone o-rings offer a viable alternative at a lower cost. Ensure the o-ring's dimensions precisely match the specifications for your Zacconi model to guarantee a leak-proof seal.

the Viton o-ring represents a worthwhile investment for users seeking long-term reliability and consistent espresso quality. While slightly more expensive than other options, its superior heat and chemical resistance, and extended lifespan make it the optimal choice for maintaining your Zacconi lever espresso machine. By making an informed decision, you can ensure your Zacconi continues to produce delicious espresso for years to come.

I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of working professionals in Bangalore tend to invest in apartments, while land, especially in the right locations.. is quietly appreciating and offering long-term benefits.

I‚Äôve been in the real estate industry for over 10 years now, currently working as a Manager with a reputed developer in Bangalore. My family has also been involved in small-scale real estate development in South Bangalore for over a decade ‚Äî buying land, building residential units, and selling them.

Here‚Äôs a quick example:  
We recently sold a 4000 sq ft building (land + construction) for ‚Çπ1.8 Cr (\~‚Çπ4,500/sft). The buyer has put it up for rent and earns ‚Çπ80k‚Äì‚Çπ1L per month. And what‚Äôs interesting ‚Äî the land value in this area has been increasing at around 10% annually.

I‚Äôve come across a few promising land parcels in South Bangalore with strong future potential ‚Äî and I‚Äôm happy to help anyone who‚Äôs looking to explore land investment, self-construction, or even custom-designed homes.  
If you're someone who‚Äôs thinking long-term or simply curious, feel free to DM me. I‚Äôm always up for a meaningful real estate discussion over a coffee.

Would love to hear your thoughts ‚Äî is land really that underrated these days?

1l7xbjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1l7xbjy/the_developed_light_roast/,The Developed Light Roast,"Background: OK, I am a professional coffee roaster and have been for about two years. I work for a small local coffee shop that has been in business for around 10 years. We purchase high-quality green beans and use a Diedrich 25kg capacity roaster. I also use artisan software for data tracking. 

I consider my roasting philosophy to be third wave, as in I appreciate the subtle complexities found in lighter roasts (ie. floral, fruity accents).  I roast dark as well because we offer a variety for customers of course. I basically use Scott Rao‚Äôs method of a steady declining RoR = good tasting cup. 

However I am finding that when I roast light (drop the beans right into FC), that I am missing some complexities. It feels like it hits and then drops off instantly in flavor (if that makes sense). If I go further, I start to lose those light attributes though, and it gets too roasty IMO. 

Thoughts on how to keep it light whilst also developing  even more flavor? 

Sidenote: I have found also that plateauing in the middle of the roast doesn‚Äôt give me what I‚Äôm looking for, and tends to taste baked in the cup. 

Thanks in advance! Happy roasting everyone. ",6,1749558111.0,roasting,8,0.88,False

I‚Äôd had a late-ish meeting and left my home office (god this feels like first world problems with that leading statement) to go to my lounge room and I walked into the room crying, but as I remember it, I was viewing myself walking into the room crying. I was devastated. I thought a somewhat demotion meant I was a shit human, mother, partner, employee‚Ä¶essentially a drain on humanity. Since then in 2022. I‚Äôve been different. About 16 months later, I thought my job and manager was the problem. I went into a secondment with a higher position. More pressure, no staff, brand new manager (in a position I applied for out of desperation). I was so lucky. I failed. Not only that, I failed on what feels a grand scale (in my mind).  I couldn‚Äôt seem to process what my manager was saying to me, I thought I was going crazy, to the point I got an MRI at the start of the secondment.

Flash to 3 months later and I feel like every day I‚Äôm waking up with a new set of issues. Not sleeping, chronic over thinking, given a literally impossible task in my new role. A 4 yo girl starting kindergarten. Fighting w partner over parenting technique. I broke. I tried limply to stand up for myself with my manager who in one meeting started a one note shared note with documented complaints about me. I confronted him thinking I was being performance managed. I broke again, in front of him, HR and a support person. I would walk down 10 flights of stairs so no one would see me crying‚Ä¶

If been seeing doctors for 3-5years. Saying how tired i was (many tests ensued, including that I might have PMDD, the closest diagnosis I‚Äôd receive) and in one instance, sent a nasty email to my sister (who I don‚Äôt talk to anymore, and I maintain what I said was justified from my view).  My mask has dropped.

I can‚Äôt hold it in anymore. Before the issue with HR, my nights with my you g daughter (4), devolved in to yelling and an uncontrollable rage. My mental health is spiralling. I never laid a hand on her, which I am grateful for, but my concern lingers that the damage is done..

A week later, I am out of the shower and crying on the couch. I am high strung and sad. I am so sad. I‚Äôve failed as a mother. My daughter is the best thing I‚Äôve done in my life. I call lifeline and then admit I‚Äôm not ok and take myself to ED, a 40 min drive away. My daughter wouldn‚Äôt get in the car with her dad so I took her. With the iPad and headphones, in a backseat child‚Äôs chair. My fingers were gripping the steering wheel so tight and I kept on repeating hope: hold on, pain ends - something I learned from a counsellor after trying to get end my life in 2017:18. After around 600 hours of leave (I am so so so lucky my work has paid, unlimited sick leave), I‚Äôm semi functional, but no where near my prior self. My work has been incredibly gentle with me. Even my bosses, bosses boss took me for a coffee and said it wasn‚Äôt me, it was my last manager - incredibly validating but i still not like who I was. I find myself stimming. Having irrational outbursts. Pms is like something I‚Äôve never experienced. Last week, I had two horrendous days and I‚Äôm not even in the office‚Ä¶ my stress tolerance is in the minus. To the point, I was at work and laughing heaps, I had this weird numbness in the back of my neck (which I think has happened before but I don‚Äôt know when). It‚Äôs like my neck muscles farigued, TMS? 

If you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you. 

I am hoping someone else in this space might have had some or any experience with this? 

My grandfather was an alcoholic, my mum drank a lot. My dad, I am convinced is autistic (ex-engineer, energy). I am trying to find patterns and a solution and it is driving me crazy.

I'm tall, fit, I have a beard, I'm on my last year of studies, I have a nice job, I'm funny, I'm outgoing, I play sports, I do interesting stuff, I read, etc. I am however also bald so I see how that may be a hindrance.

If I meet a girl in a group setting, I can turn on the charm and I can land a date, but only if she's with me long enough to see my personality. When I'm out in a club, a bar, a coffee shop, anything like that, I can't even get a number. Whenever I do get a date, it doesn't work out because we live 200 miles apart or something like that.

I feel like I'm confident, however it is a bit of a hit to my ego when I'm out with my two friends and they get approached by girls pretty much every time. I wouldn't say I'm jealous, I love those guys, I'm happy for them. However, why not me, lol. I don't look particularly worse than either of them. I don't know if I'm missing some sort of natural charisma or whatever when I have my mouth closed.

I'm a horrible texter, but I'm really in my element in an environment where I get to talk. I rely a lot on my humor which only works through my tone and gestures. I'm great at telling stories, I'm great at getting along with anybody, making conversation around a table and just being the life of the party. 

I might sound like an arrogant asshole when I say I'm a total catch, but I don't care because I know it's true. I admit I am picky. However, I still don't get why it won't work out for me. I might be too burdened by it, but I truly feel like that's the only thing I'm missing in my life and it's something I'm truly craving and can't shake off. My friends like to tell me that ""it'll happen when you least expect it"" and I just hate hearing that because it isn't comforting at all. It most often comes from those that have been in relationships since they were 15.

I feel like the biggest reason for my frustration is the peer pressure. I'm at an age where a big chunk of my friends are moving in together, getting engaged, getting married. We were hanging out last weekend and one couple talked about the renovations in the apartment they're about to move into, another talked about a trip they took, a third one talked about their anniversary and what they're going to do. Meanwhile I'm here, stagnant and falling behind.

While I'm not lonely because I do have close friends and all that, I feel lonely because I don't have anyone I can share my struggles with without feeling embarrassed or anyone who can hug and comfort me when it's rough.

I truly don't understand what the issue is. To be clear, I do not blame women for my failures. They owe me nothing.

Feel free to ask any questions if you want me to elaborate on something more and then give to me like it is. Give me some advice to, if nothing else, help me make peace with the fact that nothing's going on.",1,1749557994.0,dating_advice,20,0.6,False

**OOP Posted to** r/relationships

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8zw3r6/my_22f_childhood_boyfriend_22m_contacted_me_again/) **July 18, 2018**

All through elementary school I had a mutual crush on the same boy ‚ÄúTad‚Äù. We were ‚Äúboyfriend and girlfriend‚Äù and went to school dances together, partnered up for activities, etc. Tad eventually moved before middle school and we lost touch.

A few weeks ago, I got a Facebook friend request and it was Tad. He later sent me a message saying hello, and that he‚Äôd been looking through some old yearbooks and thought of me. We chatted in a friendly, catching up way for a while, and agreed to meet up for coffee. We did, had a nice conversation, and he seemed normal enough. I really didn‚Äôt get any weird vibes during these interactions. It just seemed like catching up with a childhood friend, talking about old classmates, etc.

However, after coffee Tad texted me and said, ‚ÄúI gotta ask you something. Do you think we could be a cute couple now like we were as kids‚Äù. I responded that I had just gotten out of a relationship and wasn‚Äôt looking for anything right now. I told him that in any case, we‚Äôd need to get to know each other again as adults, since our prior ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù was a childish crush/friendship. He seemed a little offended by this and said his feelings had never changed, and he had looked for me for years.

I know I‚Äôm not ready to jump right into a relationship, but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs even worth getting to know this guy again/giving him a chance or if I should just cut contact. The friends I‚Äôve told think it‚Äôs a bit creepy, and that‚Äôs my intuition, as well. He seems think we had an actual dating relationship as children and be confused as to why I don‚Äôt immediately want to date him. Any thoughts on how to handle this?

TL;DR: Guy I ‚Äúdated‚Äù in elementary school contacted me again and wants a relationship. He seemed confused when I told him we‚Äôd have to get to know each other as adults and said he searched for me for years. Creepy, or should I give him a chance and try to at least get to know him again?

**enrichmentonly**

>You kinda had a first date with him. Was there chemistry? Were you attracted to him? Did you have common interests?

>The most positive things you say about him in your post is that he seemed ""normal enough"" and that you ""didn't get weird vibes"". That's not like a huge endorsement.

>It doesn't sound like this is somebody you WANT to date.

**Meloetta**

>>I agree. It sounded like there was no spark when they met up, no connection beyond ""distant friend"". While no one should expect to be in love with their SO immediately, they should expect some kind of ""I'd really like to see him again"", even if it's just as a friend.

>>Someone else has mentioned the societal push to downplay intuition, and I'd like to add to that the societal push to ""give every guy a chance"". Not every guy is for you, even if they're perfectly nice. There's a special kind of connection that needs to be felt by both parties to be successful, not just ""he's nice enough"".

1l7x8uj,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1l7x8uj/the_hall_pass_dilema/,"The ""Hall Pass"" dilema","Seeking advice.
So, I'm 50 (m) and been with my partner (44, f) for about 5 years. Over the past 2 to 3 years there's been a noticeable decline in her sex-drive (due to side effects of medications - antidepressants, etc - as well as her self confidence and health limitations (weight etc). I have tried speaking with her about it a number of times, and tried to offer moral support, asking if she would attend counselling with me, and seek a best way forward.
Since the decline started, she has offered me a ""hall pass"", for me to ""scratch my itch with someone else"" whenever I need to. To date, I haven't taken the offer of a Hall pass, despite it being over 6 months since we were last intimate, and 7 months since the last time before that, and again roughly 6 months the time before. During one conversation where she offered the Hall pass, I said that if she really wanted me to use the Pass, that maybe she should find the other person (so it's setup by her, rather than me seeking someone).
For the past few years I've had a single (F) friend slightly older than myself, and so far we've been in a platonic friendship, nothing more than a hug and peck on the cheek, the same as my partnerssister has done many times. My partner has not yet met my friend, but my partner has occasionally suggested that I ""hang out"" with my friend, and says she has no objections to me having this friend.
Over the past year, there have been a couple of occasions where I'm unsure if my friend was just being friendly, or whether they were testing the waters or subversively flirting with me.
On one occasion, she asked me over to help with some minor handyman type tasks, we agreed on a time for me to arrive. When I arrived, I knocked on the door, and she answered about 2 minutes later, wearing (apparently) only a towel, as she was ""just in the shower"". She quickly showed me around her place, then went to get dressed (but left the bedroom door ajar - I didn't pursue or see anything). She returned fully dressed and showed me some of her artwork hanging in her home, as well as showing some of her framed ""glamour"" style photos of her in lingerie (no nudity, nothing revealing) from about 5 or 10 years ago. I helped out with the handyman tasks she asked for, and returned home.
On another occasion, I was helping her move furniture, she asked me to be there ""for coffee and a chat"" 15 minutes prior to her other friends arriving to help. I arrived at the agreed time, we had coffee and started talking, but her friends arrived early. Some of the furniture she asked me to move, were drawers from her dressing table, with her clean bras and underwear sitting folded neatly on top of the pile in the drawer. I said and did nothing regarding this occasion, and when the furniture was finished being moved, I returned home.
Then today she was discussing with me about what costumes we were planning on wearing to an upcoming fancy-dress event we're attending (she's coming with her teenage son, who I know, and I'm bringing my partner, and it's the first time my partner will meet my friend, whom she's heard about for a while).
During discussion with my friend about her costume, she very openly stated that she still doesn't know what underwear she'll wear under the costume, and started talking about how she might wear one of her older bras (from when her bust was less full), to ""make them sit up more"", or maybe buying a new bra, for the same effect. She mentioned her wanting to accentuate her bust, a couple of times in a short period of time. I jokingly said that owing to the time period of the fancy dress, that underwear was probably optional, but that if she did wear something to accentuate her bust (which I'm only guessing, is perfectly fine, she's just concerned about the effect of gravity and age), it would certainly get guys attention.

I feel like she (my friend) might be dropping hints or testing my response, but I'm also not sure if she's just open with what she talks about, and is comfortable talking with me and being in my company.
I feel that my partner is openly encouraging me to have this friendship, as it gives her some quiet time and gives me opportunity to have a friend (who isn't a member of extended family, or a workmate).

Do I talk to my friend, and let her know about the Hall pass situation? What are the chances that my partner will tell her, or suggest it?

You can always tell when she is spinning and not totally honest when she does these things .  Mouth dropping .. almost ready to cry . 

Her full on return to Preacher Ashley which likely got her in the mess she is running from to begin with ‚Ä¶ is back ‚Ä¶ with the cross necklace not seen in Europe but back to the God world salad.  Huh . 

We know way too much about the Petrones now  ,  it may actually be good for the MOD to pin the known information at the top of this snark for reference !  We seem to add people daily so this that could serve as a way to catch up !!! üçø

My thought on this whole thing is that they were shamed in some way and are running . I think she also is bored by her life , never happy in the slow and steady , and needed a new project . 

They came into money one way or another. Which pushed this all along . I do not think they are normally flush with money . Aside from her clothing purchases and cheap hotel trips they seem cash poor . They even seemed cash poor and cheap in Europe aside from Ashley‚Äôs purchases . 

What has become clear to me is she really is a B to atleast her kids .. so likely others . Her comment to G2 about bikes being destroyed , Q to untangled the Merc aprons and then how bitchy she sounded when G1 asked if they were tipping Friday . 

I can snark , laugh around , but she is showing her true colors and obviously treats her kids like servants to her.  

I am very curious on the church thing .  I can see without help from family how they got the TN ‚Äú land‚Äù . And soon all that will be public records . 

I think they will be miserable in TN .. the LBK house and Merc will not sell and they will be hit by more storms.  

She will be painting crap in TN black by this time next month .. ‚Äúfinding Joy in the in between ‚Äú of waiting for construction to begin.., which likely never will if Merc and or LBK house doesn‚Äôt sell for a big profit .  

They will do family walks around their 11 acres and come back covered in ticks and mosquito bites . They will stare at a big green pool ., unless they saved money to fix that first . 

They will leave kids and go to Franklin and Nashville for the night .. and fly to Miami on the regular . 

You won‚Äôt see an animal on their ‚Äú farm‚Äú any time soon . 

She will have Loriann there painting and stenciling like a crazy lady . 

We have seen this all before . 

Pack up your Uhaul Ashley with all your personal crap and the kids one box each . 

Drag their butts to small town TN .. and tell us how great it is .  

Hopefully you are bringing your big family living table for all your organic meals , family time and making granola . 

Bye bye dream of kids living at the beach , hanging out with friends at Merc after ‚Äúschool‚Äù , riding a bikes for coffee . Walking down the street for a drink .  Prancing on the beach in bikinis .. BYE BYE

See ya pretty great life .. we are running for the hills because mom and dad couldn‚Äôt keep their private stuff private ! 

Things about to get real ..

I‚Äôve lived both sides of this soul - sucking saga:  
**As a job seeker?**¬†Spent¬†*weeks*¬†bleeding into resumes, only to get radio silence after those ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled about your application!‚Äù emails. You pour your soul into bullet points, and it feels like tossing a love letter into a black hole.  
**As a recruiter?**¬†Drowned in 500+ CVs that all blur together‚Äîlike reading the same grocery list, but for ‚Äúsynergy‚Äù and ‚Äúthought leadership.‚Äù Trying to spot ‚Äúculture fit‚Äù in a PDF? Might as well guess a stranger‚Äôs personality from their Netflix history.  
So I built¬†**SwipeHire**‚Äînot because I‚Äôm some genius, but because I was¬†*tired of watching good people get lost in the noise*. Let‚Äôs break down why this might actually fix things (and why I‚Äôm spilling this here, where the internet tells it like it is).

# The Problem: Hiring Is a Robot - Run Dating App (And Nobody Signed Up For That)

Resumes don‚Äôt tell stories‚Äîthey‚Äôre just keyword - stuffed resumes in disguise. Recruiters skim, candidates ghost, and ‚Äúculture fit‚Äù becomes a buzzword for ‚Äúpeople who talk like me.‚Äù It‚Äôs dehumanizing. We deserve better.

# The SwipeHire Fix: Let‚Äôs Bring Back the ‚ÄúHuman‚Äù in ‚ÄúHuman Resources‚Äù

Forget lifeless bullet points‚Äî**we‚Äôre putting people back at the center**:  


* **For job seekers**: Ditch the resume. Record a 30 - second video instead. Show your¬†*vibe*‚Äîthe quirks, the passion, the ‚Äúwhy you do what you do.‚Äù No more hiding behind jargon; let your personality¬†*breathe*.
* **For recruiters**: Swipe through video profiles like you‚Äôre scrolling for coffee dates (but, you know, for jobs). See how someone¬†*communicates*, how they think on their feet, whether they‚Äôd actually vibe with your team‚Äî**before**¬†you dig into their work history.

And the AI? It‚Äôs not here to judge‚Äîit‚Äôs here to¬†*help*:  


* Job seekers get AI script tips (e.g., ‚ÄúAdd that story about the time you fixed a crisis‚Äîrecruiters eat that up‚Äù).
* Recruiters get match scores that factor in¬†*culture fit*¬†and skills‚Äîno more keyword bingo.

Oh, and ghosting? We‚Äôre nuking that. If you get rejected, the AI sends personalized feedback (e.g., ‚ÄúYour video was fire, but highlight X skill for these roles‚Äù). No more guessing why you got the silent treatment.

# Why I‚Äôm Sharing This on Reddit (Not LinkedIn, Where People Pretend to Be Perfect)

This isn‚Äôt a shiny ‚Äúproduct launch.‚Äù This is me, a regular person, saying:¬†*‚ÄúI built something messy, and I need your help to fix it.‚Äù*  
Reddit‚Äôs the only place I trust for raw, unfiltered truth. So:  


* **Want to beta test?**¬†DM me. We‚Äôre small, we‚Äôre scrappy, and we‚Äôll hook you up.
* **Got feedback?**¬†Spill it. I‚Äôve already messed up plenty (like when people hated recording videos, so we added AI avatars for shy folks‚Ä¶ or when ‚Äútoo many filters‚Äù made the app feel like a spreadsheet).

Let‚Äôs be real about the numbers, too:  


* Beta user spreaded over 5 continents (job seekers + recruiters)
* $0 revenue (we‚Äôre pre - revenue, testing pricing‚Äîno ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù paywalls here)

# Let‚Äôs Talk‚ÄîNo Corporate BS Allowed

1l7x6rj,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1l7x6rj/tifu_by_turning_a_routine_extraction_into_a_full/,TIFU by turning a routine extraction into a full on dental disaster,"So, I‚Äôm a dentist, and I‚Äôve been yanking teeth for over a decade, but yesterday, I turned a simple third molar extraction into a scene straight out of a horror flick. Buckle up, because I‚Äôm still spiraling, and I need to get this off my chest before I lose it in the op next week. It started innocently enough. Patient comes in, female, ASA 1, late-20s, nervous but chill, here for a lower left 8 that‚Äôs been giving them grief. Radiograph shows it‚Äôs mesioangular, partially impacted, nothing I haven‚Äôt seen a million times. I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄúEasy peasy, in and out in 20 minutes, maybe I‚Äôll even grab a coffee after.‚Äù Spoiler: I did not get that coffee.

I numb them up with a good ol‚Äô IANB, throw in some buccal infiltration for kicks, and we‚Äôre vibing. Patient‚Äôs got their noise canceling headphones on, blasting some lo-fi beats, and I‚Äôm in the zone, elevator in hand, ready to luxate this bad boy. The tooth‚Äôs cooperative at first slight mobility, no drama. Then, I swear on my loupes, this molar decides it‚Äôs auditioning for The Exorcist.

I‚Äôm working the periosteal elevator, trying to get some purchase, when the damn thing fractures. Not just a little crack oh no, this tooth explodes into what I can only describe as coronal confetti. I‚Äôm staring at a pulpal mess, and the patient‚Äôs still bobbing their head to their playlist, oblivious. I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúOkay, stay calm, just section it and move on.‚Äù So, I grab the high-speed, diamond bur spinning like my anxiety, and start troughing around the roots. That‚Äôs when I realize the distal root is practically shaking hands with the inferior alveolar nerve. Great. Just great. I‚Äôm sweating through my nitrile gloves at this point, and my assistant (bless her), she‚Äôs new and hands me a rongeur like it‚Äôs a peace offering. I‚Äôm trying to finesse the fragments out, but the buccal plate decides it‚Äôs done with life and just‚Ä¶ crumbles. Now I‚Äôve got a bone window that looks like I took a jackhammer to it, and I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm one wrong move from a paresthesia lawsuit. The patient‚Äôs still chilling, thank God for articaine, but I‚Äôm mentally writing my resignation letter.

Here‚Äôs where it gets unhinged. I‚Äôm fishing for the last root tip, and my suction slips because of course it does, and I accidentally yeet a chunk of amalgam from an adjacent 7 into the patient‚Äôs throat. They gag, I panic, and my assistant screams, ‚ÄúIS THAT A TOOTH?!‚Äù No, Karen, it‚Äôs not a tooth, it‚Äôs a rogue filling, and now I‚Äôm wondering if I need to call ENT or just pray they cough it up later. I‚Äôm yelling, ‚ÄúSpit! Spit!‚Äù like a deranged cheerleader, and they finally hawk it into the spittoon. Crisis averted. Kinda. By some miracle, I get the root out, patch up the socket with some collagen sponge, and throw in a couple of resorbable sutures. The patient‚Äôs none the wiser, thinks it went ‚Äúfine,‚Äù and I‚Äôm standing there with a fake smile, my scrubs soaked like I ran a marathon. I send them off with post-op instructions and a Vicodin script, praying they don‚Äôt notice their jaw feels like a construction site.

Now I‚Äôm home, sipping whiskey out of a coffee mug, wondering if I should‚Äôve gone to optometry school instead. My assistant keeps texting me memes about ‚Äúdentist life,‚Äù and I‚Äôm questioning every life choice that led me to this moment. Did I mention the patient left a 5-star Yelp review? Said I was ‚Äúsuper chill.‚Äù I‚Äôm not chill. I‚Äôm a walking OSHA violation.

And to top it all off, this morning I get a text from the patient asking if it‚Äôs normal to find a tiny piece of ‚Äúshiny stuff‚Äù in their cereal. I‚Äôm 99% sure it‚Äôs just their granola, but now I‚Äôm paranoid it‚Äôs another chunk of amalgam staging a jailbreak. Send me to dental purgatory, I‚Äôm ready.

TL;DR: F‚Äôd up a routine wisdom tooth extraction, turned it into a buccal bone massacre, yeeted an amalgam into the patient‚Äôs throat, and somehow got away with it. Send help (or whiskey).",32,1749557725.0,tifu,39,0.73,False
