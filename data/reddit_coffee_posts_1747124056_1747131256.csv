She was about to experience the surreal reality of paying nearly USD100 (RM435) for what would typically cost less than USD15 (RM65) back in Malaysia.

“I’m literally going crazy with these prices,” she tells her viewers, staring in disbelief at the USD95.25 bill (approximately RM414) for what Malaysians consider everyday comfort food: curry chicken rice, char kway teow (stir-fried noodles), chicken rice, vegetables, and the quintessential Malaysian teh tarik.

The price disparity doesn’t stop at Malaysian cuisine.

During her California adventure, she documented the startling cost of basic breakfast items—two eggs set her back USD12.50 (RM54.35), while a modest breakfast spread of turkey bacon, avocado tartine, smoked salmon omelette, and coffee drinks demands USD61.20 (RM266.09) after the mandatory 18% tip.",1,1747130975.0,malaysia,0,1.0,False

He’s the network admin, but honestly, I just thought he was some weird IT goblin who only comes upstairs for coffee and to glare at us when the WiFi is slow. He’s always muttering about “firewalls” and “patches” and “uptime,” but to me, it just sounds like Dungeons & Dragons spells tbh.

Anyway, Greg’s always on this ancient-looking weird Linux machine with no gui, typing away in a black window with green text like he’s in The Matrix for some reasons. He’s got this beard that looks like it’s seen some things, and he wears the same “I void warranties” t-shirt every day. I once asked him what he actually does, and he just said, “I keep the lights on.” Whatever, Gandalf.

One day, Greg luckily left his lair to go to some “critical maintenance window” meeting. I was bored, and his computer was just sitting there, unlocked, humming away. I thought, “Why is he still using this stupid and useless Linux stuff? Windows 11 is so much easier. He could just click things instead of typing all day.” So, I grabbed my trusty Windows 11 USB and went to work.

First problem: his computer wouldn’t even boot from USB. I had to Google how to get into the BIOS, and it was all in some weird font. After like 20 minutes, I finally got it to boot. Installing Windows 11 was a breeze—took like 10 minutes. I even set up the best browser for him, Edge, as the default browser for him. You’re welcome, Greg.

He came back from his meeting, saw the Windows login screen, and just… stopped. He stared at it like he’d just seen his dog get run over. “What… what the hell! have you done to my computer!!??” he yelled. I grinned. “Upgraded you, bro! No more weird Linux stuff. Now you can just use the Start menu. You’re welcome.”

He didn’t say anything. He just sat down, started clicking around, and then his face went pale. “Where are my SSH keys? Where’s my terminal? Where’s… oh god, the scripts…” He started typing random things into the search bar. “Where’s my VPN client? My monitoring tools? My firewall config, WHERE'S EVERYTHING?!!!”

I shrugged. “Dude, just use PowerShell. It’s like Terminal, but blue. And you can use Microsoft Store now!”

He just stared at me, then sprinted out of the basement. I figured he was going to get a coffee or something. Five minutes later, the office WiFi died. Then the printers stopped working. Then the phones. Then the website. People started coming out of their offices, looking confused. The CEO came out, yelling, “Why can’t I access my email?!”

Greg came back, looking like he’d aged ten years in ten minutes. “I can’t access the servers. I can’t push updates. I can’t even log in to the firewall. Everything is locked down. My credentials were on that machine. My scripts. My configs. EVERYTHING.”

I tried to help. “Just use Remote Desktop, bro. Windows has that built in.” He looked at me like I’d just suggested he fix the servers with a hammer.

The next hour was chaos. The entire company ground to a halt. People were yelling, the CEO was threatening to call “the cloud,” and Greg was frantically trying to recover his files from some backup he’d hidden in a server rack. I just sat there, sipping my coffee, wondering why everyone was so upset. I mean, Windows 11 has dark mode now. What’s the problem?

By the end of the day, Greg had managed to get most things running again, but he wouldn’t even look at me. He just muttered something about “never trusting surface dwellers” and went back to his basement.

Now, every time I walk by the server room, I hear the locks click shut. I think Greg put up a sign that says “No Windows Allowed.” The CEO banned me from touching any computer that isn’t mine. I still don’t get what the big deal was :-/🤷. Windows is better, right?

Next week, I’m going to show Greg how to use Cortana. Maybe that’ll cheer him up :) . ",0,1747130944.0,linuxsucks,0,0.5,False

# Chapter 1

Harper

I watch as my mother lays sprawled out on the patchwork sofa drunk again. It is the story of my life, she has one arm hanging down to the ground and a practically empty bottle of booze, Vodka I think, I can't see the label hugged to her chest. Funny how she can manage to clutch on to a bottle of booze and nothing else. Her breathing is low, I wonder if it will be her last breath, do I care? I should but my mother has been a drunk ever since I can remember and a junkie, not the heroin kind no she likes cocaine and her boyfriends that come and go are her suppliers. I swear she only hooks up with low life deadbeats for her next fix. But yes, I would care, because you know what she is my mother, and she is the only mother I've got.



I want to shake her and wake her up, maybe if she'd managed to stay clean my father wouldn't have left when I was just a kid, five years of age to be precise. It still hurts. I remember him holding me tightly to him and kissing me, telling me how much he loved me, how precious I was to him and how often he would see me. Which he did, I mean sure he works away a lot, he is in finance and travels with his business so nowadays I don't get to see him all that much but he has always been and still is a good dad.



My phone buzzes in my denim cut off shorts. I take it out of my back pocket. Where are you, thought we were meeting up now. We've got an assignment to hand in tomorrow.



I bite my lip, shit I totally forgot what the time was. Instead of keeping track of it I have been reading in my bedroom and writing in my journal at times. Laying out all my hurt, anger and pain about my situation. I text Dylan back, he's my ex-boyfriend. We dated for five years in High School and in college. We have managed to remain friends which is a good thing because right now I have nobody else. I have a couple of girlfriends, but I wouldn't say we're that close, not like Dylan and I. He became my best friend; I had liked him ever since my mom moved us here to Lincoln in the small suburb that is now home. His folks lived across the street, but now it's just his father. His hot, sexy father I have to say. That man could melt your panties right off.



I'm not going to lie; I have had some serious dreams about his daddy. I daren't tell anyone because you know he's my ex's daddy and all of that, and he is much older. Of course he would be, Dylan told me he was just seventeen when Dylan was born so that would make him thirty-seven to my twenty years of age. Anyway, I need to message Dylan back and get my shit together. We have a study date. I don't want to be stuck in a hell hole like this forever.



He is majoring in Politics, and I am studying business and finance, I want to take after my own father and work in a large corporation and travel the world and get out of dodge. I want the big house, the fancy car, I want to buy as much make-up, shoes and clothes as I want, not be in hand-me-downs forever. Kids used to poke fun at me at school, seriously I hated being at school.



If it wasn't for Dylan always being there for me, I probably would have just skipped class all the time. But he was there for me, and I am grateful to him for that.



Sure, I am on my way. Sorry I got waylaid.



Your mother again?



Yeah, something like that. She is out stone cold on the sofa, total waste of fucking space.



Hey, that's your mom all said and done, don't speak about her like that. She needs help, Harper.



How can I help a woman who doesn't want to help herself?



We can figure something out.



Yeah, we've been trying that for the last God knows how many years, it's exhausting, it is mentally draining, and you know what, I just don't think I can take it no more.



Come on over, my dad is here, he's making his famous lasagna.



That buoys my spirits up some, the thought of watching Levy cooking and perving over him makes me warm down there and sends a rush of heat through my entire body. Shit, I need to get control of this, if Dylan even suspects I've got the hots for his daddy he will ditch me hotter than hot coals.



On my way. See you soon.



My mom calls out for me, I ignore her then feel like a complete loser myself so go grab a blanket from the chair near the sofa she is laying on and drape it over her.



""I have to go, Mommy, I've got study with Dylan.""



""Okay, Baby. See you later."" She drifts off again and I stare down at her tiny, frail body not even sure when it was, she ate last.



""Try to eat something, Mommy."" I bend down and kiss the top of her head. I know she can't hear me, she's out cold again. I move the bottle from her arm and leave it on the coffee table beside the sofa, that is strewn with cigarettes, an over full ashtray, an empty bottle of Brandy and an old note still rolled up from her doing lines last night. I shake my head. Help, how on earth can I get her help. We don't have money, my father won't help her anymore, she's been in rehab several times over the years costing him a pretty dollar and for nothing. As soon as she is back out, she's back on everything.



My bag is on the floor by the front door that needs painting, I sling it over my shoulder and close the front door quietly behind me. At least I can check Levy out, that's something that will cheer me up. I am dying to tell my favorite girlfriend, Summer all about him but I know she'll tell me I am gross for fancying an older man. I shrug my shoulders, who cares what they think. I don't give a flying fuck.



Outside it's already cool now that we are in Fall, the trees have turned color and displaying their brightness of reds, oranges, yellows and russets. Fall is my all-time favorite time of the year, the air is crisp and it's such a welcome break from all the damn heat and humidity of the summer.



Dylan only lives across the road so it's no shakes to walk across and be there in a couple of minutes. The door is open, I never need to knock, his father has always made me welcome and his mother. Only, his mother isn't alive anymore. She died two years ago of cancer, it started in her breast but by the time they found it, well it had spread too far inside her body eating at her. It was a tragic time for them and honestly, I am not sure that Dylan and his daddy, Levy have recovered. How do you recover from something like that?



I can smell something delicious coming from the small kitchen at the back of the house. I know I ought to go upstairs straight to Dylan's room where we always study but I can't resist going into the kitchen where I know Levy will be.



He stands there at the cooker and takes my breath away. His curly, dark hair is tied into a man-bun, his tight black T-shirt fits him perfectly and outlines his tight body, his biceps are on display and fuck me, he is as hot as sin. I want to trail my fingers up his arms, touch the ink on his forearms that continue up and under the sleeves of his T-shirt. The familiar sensation of wetness is between my legs, my breath hitches. He glances up and looks at me, and winks. My legs almost go to jelly and buckle, fuck I want this man like I've never wanted any other man before. Not even Dylan. Sure, the sex was good with Dylan but I bet Levy knows exactly how to satisfy a girl.



""How you doing, Sunflower?"" He asks, making me swoon for him. I love it when he calls me Sunflower. He said once that I am like the brightness of that flower representing summer and all things bright, on a dark and grey, miserable day.



""Er, yeah, I'm fine Mr Hudson.""



He cocks an eyebrow, fuck my panties are getting wetter, I am practically drooling at the way his tight black jeans hug his ass, I want to run my hands over it and then explore what he has tucked in the front.



""Levy. You call me Levy, Sunflower. Not Mr Hudson.""



I walk into the kitchen, wait what am I doing? I want to stand near him, I want to inhale him, he's like a hypnotic drug and I can't stop myself. He turns placing the wooden spoon down on the dish by the side of the hob. I can feel his eyes on my body as he looks from my eyes to my lips, down to my chest, his green, sultry eyes taking me in like a long, cold drink of lemonade. Quickly as if he realizes what he is doing, he turns away and coughs.



""Dylan is upstairs,"" he tells me his voice gruff. There is only one reason it's that way, because I am betting the sight of me in my tiny shorts even though it's cooler outside and my tight, white button down is making him have a reaction to me that he wished he didn't have.



# Chapter 2



Levy



I know it's hot in the kitchen where I'm cooking but more to the point it's Harper, that girl is all woman but there's a problem she is just twenty years of age. Being anywhere near her is killing me that and she's my boy's ex-girlfriend. Fucked up, right? You bet it is.



I'm old enough to be her dad, okay so being thirty-eight isn't like ancient but I had Dylan when his mother and I were just kids ourselves at eighteen. We had an accident, but hell let me tell you, Dylan was the best accident in the world. We loved him like no tomorrow, he was our entire universe, and he still is mine.



It hasn't been easy. When Lilly died three years ago, it was hard to watch her suffer whilst the cancer ate away at her and I became the only parent to Dylan. To be honest, I had to be the main parent ever since Lilly first became sick. I stir the food.



""So, Levy how's it going?"" Harper asks me, is she standing too close to me? I like the way my name sounds as she says it, like silk. I wonder even though I shouldn't how it would sound coming from her lips if I had my cock inside her. Fuck I need to stop thinking about Harper like that. She's just a kid in my eyes even though she's twenty and by rights a woman now. I wish I didn't feel like this but Man that girl has all grown up.



She's no longer the kid with braces and glasses who'd come over and play with Dylan when they were eleven going on thirty, the little girl who'd fall off his skateboard and need a plaster on her knee. No way, this girl is all grown up with long, lean legs from all the running she does, her waist is small, I reckon I could span my hands around it easily and that long blonde hair of hers, hangs down her back like a waterfall. I try to focus on the food I'm cooking instead of her butt in those skimpy shorts she is wearing. Do you reckon she knows what she's doing to me.



""It's going well, Sunflower. Don't you want to go hang with Dylan?"" I have to get rid of her, I'm bursting in my pants right now and hugging as close to the hob and counter as much as I can without burning myself. There is no way I can let her see she's causing me to have an erection which is killing me in my jeans.



""Sure, I'll go up and see him in a bit, I kinda like talking to you, Levy."" Damn I could easily crush my lips on hers and press her up against my groin. The heat is getting to me, I can't tell if it's the hot food cooking away on the hob or her close proximity to me right now.



She moves closer to me, she smells of jasmine, it fills my nostrils. I want to move towards her and reach my hands around her waist and kiss her with such a force it takes me by surprise. Instantly, I feel guilty. I shouldn't feel like this about Harper. Of all people not her but she is difficult to resist. I place the wooden spoon down that I've been stirring the food with and move back slightly. She comes closer. Her corn blue eyes are wide and innocent looking. I don't even want to wonder if she is still a virgin or not, God help me I don't want to think about if Dylan and Harper have had sex.



""Maybe you should go up now, Harper."" I growl at her more fiercely thank I perhaps should have done. She looks surprised, her eyebrows raise then she cocks her head. I watch as she runs her tongue across her bottom lip and feel my cock twitch in my pants.



""Hey, you're here."" Dylan says as he comes bowling into the kitchen. ""Wondered where the hell you got to. You said you'd be here in a few minutes. Hey Dad when will dinner be ready, I'm starving?"" The kid is always starving, I swear he has hollow legs. He's lean like a basketball player.



""Not long. Say, why don't you kids go on up and study and I'll give you a shout in around thirty minutes or so.""



""I'm not a kid anymore."" Harper tells me and places a hand on her hip that she juts out. Fuck me, she's going to undo me any minute now.



""You're always going to be kids to me."" I tell her gruffly.



""Yeah, Dad we're like twenty now, news flash coming in. We. Are. Not. Kids."" Dylan swats me playfully on the arm. ""C'mon Harper we've got work to do and you're slacking. Is your mom okay?"" He always worries about Harper's mom. It's no secret the woman has issues and is a drunk, we've tried to help by being there for her and for Harper, but she just can't let the drinking go. I've cooked more dinners for Harper over the years and Lilly too when she was alive, than Harper's own mother.



""She's fine. You know how it is. Hanging on to the damn bottle on the sofa.""



""You can take her some dinner over later, Sunflower."" My voice is softer this time. I'd do anything to make Harper's life better. Literally anything. The girl is special, she's always full of sunshine and roses, nothing gets her down and when Lilly died, she was there for Dylan and I. Always making sure we were good to go and cooking for us when we couldn't face doing it.



""I'll grab us some water, Dylan go on up, I'll be right behind you."" She tells my son then looks at me and winks. God fucking help me, she's going to be the death of me.



Dylan takes himself out of the kitchen and heads back up the stairs. Harper comes and stands by my side at the kitchen sink. My arms are folded across my chest, my ankles crossed as I lean against the counter. She brushes her arm against mine, electric pulses through my entire body like a shock. It's been a very long time since any kind of touch has done that to me. She leans across me to grab a glass from the cupboard by my head, her breast brushes against my bicep.



""Just letting you know, Levy that I'm all woman now Levy.""



# Chapter 3



Harper



It sure was fun watching Levy suffer like that. He's a man, I know he's tempted and best of all he's an older man, a man with experience. All girls like that, right? A man who'll know exactly what to do, not like boys. I love his broad shoulders and those sexy, black tattoos he has running up his arms, let me tell you he is such a turn on. I wonder how big his dick is and cannot wait to get home later tonight to play with my vibrator thinking about Levy fucking me.



""Earth calling, Harper. Where's your head at?"" Dylan asks as he turns to look at me coming through his bedroom. It's painted in sky blue with a double bed on the right, his writing and study desk on the left wall and he still has his dinosaurs on display from when he was a kid. Some things will never change.



""Oh, nowhere."" I tell him as I flop myself down on the bed, dumping my bag with my books in it on the floor.



""I know that look, is it a boy? Tell me, are you seeing someone new.""



""Hell no. Are you seeing a girl?"" It doesn't fuss me if he does, we dated for five years and it was good, you know we were best friends growing up and it just seemed natural that we became boyfriend and girlfriend so if he is seeing another girl, I say good for him. Dylan deserves to be happy especially having gone through what he went through when his mother died. My heart was ripped apart for him, but he's doing much better now and has been to counselling and is dealing with the grief. Thankfully he never turned to drink or used drugs like some kids I know.



""Nah, I need to focus on my studies, Harp. Too much riding on it. I want to do well and get myself a good job.""



""Your daddy does well, can't you go into business with him?"" His father owns a chain of motorcycle stores across the country, he's no billionaire but he has a lot of money. I can't lie it's another reason he turns me on because he is a self-made man, and he rides a bike. I'd sure as hell love to get on the back of it and go for a ride with him, fuck I'd like to ride Levy that's for sure. I go dreamy again, wondering about his touch on me, how his fingers would feel inside my pussy. I squeeze my thighs together.



Dylan looks at me weirdly. ""What you looking at me like that for?"" I ask him.



""You look fucking goofy is why, Harp. Who you thinking about? I know it's a guy, spill already."" Shit, I can't let him know I'm having wet dreams about his daddy, fuck that'd really harm our friendship and since Dylan is like my best friend in the entire world, I can't risk him ever finding out.



""Ah, you know just day dreaming, Dylan. So, tell me, are you going to Lacey's party tomorrow night? I hear there will be a live band playing. I'm so excited to finally go to a party all this studying is giving me a headache.""



""I wasn't going to but you know, I think we both need a break. Let's do it."" We high five and I love to see him smile, he's going to be alright I can feel it.



""What shall I wear? Thinking maybe my torn black denims, a rock T-shirt with my bright pink bra underneath and some chains around my neck."" He raises his eyebrows and chuckles.



""You trying to look like my dad?""



""What? Does your dad wear a bright pink bra now?"" I chuckle. Dylan throws a cushion at me.



""No, the whole black outfit thing.""



Oops maybe I'm giving myself away a bit too obviously. ""I just fancy a change is all.""



""Well, whatever you do, don't go dying your hair. It's so pretty all that blonde color and natural.""



""I'd never dye my hair; I love it too much.""



""Yeah, it's real Blake Lively on you."" He turns and starts opening one of his assignment books. ""You should start dating again, Harp. You know I'll always love you, right? Just I've noticed you haven't been out with anyone since we split in the summer.""



Oh, hell. How do I tell him that's because I don't want a boy anymore, I want his daddy and his daddy alone. I can't stop thinking about Levy and I know that I started thinking differently about Levy over the summer. Maybe it's all the changes my body has been going through lately, my hormones or maybe I'm just growing up.



""Yeah, maybe."" I shrug my shoulders, and let my hair fall slightly over my face as I can feel myself blushing.



We study peacefully next to each other, cramped on his study table, just like we've always done. Dylan has a playlist on, it's mostly grunge because that is what he's into. Me I like all sorts of music, currently I'm into Taylor Swift but Dylan can't stand her. We have had many an argument over Miss Swift let me tell you. He always gives in though and lets me listen to her, so yeah, today I'll let him play his grunge music.



His dad calls up to announce dinner is ready. I close my study book quicker than a bat out of hell, causing Dylan to glance up at me then bolt downstairs like lightning. ""Hey, wait for me."" He calls after me.



Levy's muscles flex as he places the heavy dish of food in the middle of the table, I want to run my fingers up his arms and squeeze his bicep. ""Take a seat young lady."" Oo, I like it when he calls me lady. Dylan throws himself in a chair next to me and his daddy takes the chair the other side of me. As Dylan stretches over for the serving spoon, I take the opportunity to move my chair closer to Levy, without Dylan noticing.



I can feel the heat coming from his body as I allow my thigh to brush up against his. Levy drops the bottle of beer that was about to hit his lips. He starts coughing. I slap him on the back. ""Are you okay, Levy?"" My voice all sweet as sugar and candy.



""Yeah, yeah just went down the wrong way is all."" He recovers himself and picks the bottle of beer up. Dylan hands him a cloth he retrieved from the sink behind us.



""Here you go, Dad. I'll get you a fresh beer.""



""Thanks, Son."" Levy glares at me, his dark eyes are brooding. I slide my hand under the table and squeeze his thigh. He grabs my hand, my pulse is racing at the intensity of the heat and the scorching feeling from his large, calloused hand on mine. Dylan is chatting away completely oblivious to what is going on under the table.



Levy almost hurts my hand as he squeezes it and removes it from his own thigh and places it on my thigh. ""Stop it."" He hisses in my ear, his warm breath sending tingles up and down my spine.



Not fucking likely I think to myself. I want this man and if it's the last thing I do I will have Levy one way or another.",1,1747130936.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

We all have different opinions on various aspects of values and trading and that's perfectly okay as long as discussions surrounding it stays civil and respectful. It's not okay to attack, harass, and spread misinformation about users just because they have their own views and experiences. 

We've come across so many posts posting arguments among one another that have had to be dealt with. Not only is it harsh and unnecessary, it also breaks the rules of our subreddit, such as, **Rule 8- No Exposing Users** and **Rule 11- Be a Decent Human Being**. The same thing goes for the comments under these posts or similar ones discussing the topic. 

We don't tear down or favor certain values and have no official stance on Adopt Me values, and this ban is **not** a reflection on the team's view on the topic of 'HTT Pets'. As the moderators of r/AdoptMeRBX, it is our responsibility to ensure the friendliness and safety of this community.

We sincerely hope that when this ban is lifted, we can all be more respectful and mature. If you won't be able to handle or respond appropriately to disagreements, please use the 'Hide Post' feature on Reddit. It will benefit us all and save a lot of time for both, the moderators and the users involved. We will still be moderating this heavily after the ban is lifted to avoid this from happening again.

1kli5ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1kli5ww/needing_none_antipsych_med_suggestions_that_are/,"Needing none anti-psych med suggestions, that are as strong as Seroquel","Hi all,
So I've been dealing with insomnia for what feels like forever! Haven't had a sleep study so far, but feel confident it's due to complex PTSD, having hypervigilance that won't let me sleep, even when I'm exhausted. Seroquol has been helping me get some sleep, but after a while it starts causing me restless legs. I've been put on sifrol to help it, but eventually the RLS breaks through and I have to go up a dose of Sifrol. I can only go up a dose about 4 times, think Max dose is 4.5mg. 

So I really need a med I can take that will be sedating enough to get me to sleep and stay asleep. 
(I'm from Australia btw)

Need ones that don't have antihistamines as they will cause me restless legs 🤔😔.
The idea I've had and talked to my psychiatrist about, is to cycle between meds for sleep so I don't get a tolerance (hopefully, 😬my tolerance is already pretty high to things). I want to use Seroquol still, as it's often reliable for me to get some sleep. So just needing to find something else I could use for a month or 2 and switch back and forward with the Seroquel.

* I also take 7.5mg Zopiclone, which I believe at this point doesn't do much, as I've been taking nightly last few years. 

* I take 25 to 50mg baclofen. I take a 50mg if I'm having a hard night.

* I take Temazapam 10mg about once or twice a week on average. On more difficult nights, especially due to being triggered from therapy.
I'm doing 2 hour EMDR sessions weekly, with nerofeedback at the end. The temaz doesn't always do very much to help, but grateful to be trusted with the option. 

* I also have a self medicating issue with alcohol. I drink through the night to help me get to sleep. I don't drink to black out, only to calm and sleep. But I have a high tolerance as this has been a long term thing. I monitor how much I have and try to have as less as I can. Only to the point I need it.
I don't have any stimulants, don't drink coffee. Have a daily camomile tea 

*I occasionally have a melatonin tab, I don't know if it always does much, but take them on nights I'm doing well. They have helped in the past but they quickly stop working.

Most recently I've tried low dose Avanza, no help.
Clonidine (even tho I don't have adhd) it didn't help sadly.
Next tried Dora medication (belsomra suvorexant). Had for 12 days, it wasn't helping, I had fun with sleep paralysis and hallucinations, but I was coping with that, the last few days on it I was feeling my insomnia worsening. So decided to stop. It's also expensive med, so there is that too.

I've tried all the therapies, some a few times. It's been a long journey and it's complex. I want to work on sleep hygiene with the cycle of meds. But it's tricky for many reasons.
Trying to get sun when I wake up.
Been looking at sleep hub, want to look into their program some more, as they claim to be able to help get you back to normal sleep. Not holding my breath on that tho.

I've been able to do sleep hygiene in the past and it still didn't work for me. My ptsd can be so random, it once caused me to have a racing heart every time I was falling to sleep, that would wake me up. Thought my heart was playing up, as I wasn't aware of being in extra fear state for any reason. Had a 24 hour ecg, and was clear of issues, so they said it was most likely panic. It was there for varying degrees for about 2 months then just stopped. But in general, sleep is a issue and it scares me to not get it, I don't want to drink more and I need to be able to function to work on my healing.
Really appreciate any suggestions and empathy, insomnia is such a sucky illness, really feel for everyone struggling with it 🌸✌ ",1,1747130780.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

# 1 - Evie

Joy has gone AWOL. We think she’s going after Evie. – Isiah



Zydeco, the enforcer for the Baton Rouge Cajuns, got the message when they stopped for gas in the early afternoon. He called Gator, his club president, who had received the same message. Walking away from his men, he listened to the few details that the other man had.



He, like most of the other men with him, wore his hair pulled back in a ponytail. While he was on the phone, his fingers ran through it in frustration. After hanging up and shoving his phone back into his pocket, he turned to the four other men with him. Pulling his hair back into a ponytail, he looked over at his friends and brothers.



They all wore jeans and thick soled motorcycle boots. Most of them wore dark t-shirts under their leather cuts. Santa wore his typical bright red shirt. On the back of the club cut was a golden outline of the state of Louisiana filled with the state flag. The blue background with a pelican, her wings partially spread, as she looks down at her three hatchlings.



“Cajuns, piss if you need to. Call your ladies. We’re going up north to Evie.” Zydeco said as he punched in the address that Gator texted to him separately. He didn’t need to give any more details, they all received the same mass text from the club president. “I’ve got lead, we leave in five.”



Evie was the widow of Zydeco’s nephew, Cade. Their other partner, and her legal husband, Daniel, and Cade had both been killed while in the line of duty just under four years ago.



Daniel’s mother, Joy, held Evie responsible for her son’s death. While still grieving her loss, and fighting deep depression, Evie had to get a restraining order against her former mother-in-law. Last year, Evie moved away from the town that held so many memories of her husbands to Massachusetts to start over.



Halfway across the country did not seem far enough if Joy had broken her house arrest for violating the restraining order earlier in the year when Evie’s new men brought her home for a weekend. Now it appeared that Joy had disappeared to drive from Austin, Texas all the way up to Ridgeview, Massachusetts.



Almost exactly five minutes later, they pulled out onto interstate 20 in Tallulah, Louisianna. From the northeastern corner of their state, they headed back out, going eastward this time. GPS estimated the travel time at nearly twenty-two hours. They stopped again just after midnight, about halfway to their destination.



“Do we need to take a break? Everyone good to go through the night?” Zydeco asked.



“That’s our girl.” Darkness said. “We’re good.”



The other men agreed, and they continued through the night. Around five they stopped at an all-night McDonald’s. The meal was quick and the coffee plenty.



Near midday, about an hour outside of Ridgeview, they stopped for gas and more caffeine. Zydeco called his brother-in-law. He was angry when he ended the call.



“Cajuns!” he called as he mounted his bike. “Our girl’s been shot. Let’s go.”



Making good time it was less than an hour later when they parked with a large group of bikes and walked towards the emergency room doors.



“Priest, got your dog collar?” Zydeco asked.



“I got my creds.” He confirmed just before they entered the hospital. With the door closing behind them, Priest pulled out his wallet and found the card showing that he was a chaplain with a well-known veteran’s organization.



The two men walked up to the window for the clerk. As they worked on getting Priest in the back with Evie, the other three sat down. Darkness sat next to the heavily tattooed man who looked completely lost.



Darkness was a tall man at a little over six feet. He had broad shoulders and corded muscles covering his body. Like his father before him, he had been scouted by the NFL. Unlike his father, he did not pursue it.



Swampthang, a young brunette, leaned into Santa and quietly asked “You think she remembers how to have sex with just one man?”



He spoke quietly and in creole. But Darkness heard the man sitting across from him and gave them both a warning glare.



“If you want to die, go ask one of her men.” Stroking his long white beard, Santa replied with a small laugh and Darkness nodded.



“They’re letting Priest back. That dog collar of his comes in handy sometimes.” Zydeco said in English as he sat down across from Darkness. “Anybody know where The Thief is?”



Darkness shook his head as he grinned at his adopted father. It was an old argument that all the Cajuns knew.



Zydeco's sister left Louisianna when she married Roscoe a little over three decades ago. During that time, he had worked his way through the ranks and was now the president of the Austin chapter of the Texas Renegades. Ever since, he had called Roscoe \*The Thief\*. He even had a nameplate with it. He swore that one day he would get it on Roscoe’s cut, even though the Texas charter did not use road names. They all simply answered to the name \*Renegade\*.



The others continued to talk for a while, Darkness ignored them. He was watching the doors wanting to see the Renegades come through the glass doors. Or Priest come in from the back.



He was not many years older than Evie and saw her as the little sister that he needed to protect. Even more so after the incident that suddenly took her men from her. But from what little Eves and her brother had said, she was now in a much better place.



And she had two new men. Presumably, the two men next to him that looked like they were losing their world.



Soon enough the Renegades walked in. Dixie went straight to the two men sitting in the cramped chairs next to Darkness. They wrapped her up between them and held on to their woman’s mother.



She was a tiny woman, especially compared to her own three men. And even more so compared to her daughter’s two men. The five feet three woman disappeared between the two muscled men. One was built like a tank and the other covered in tattoos.



Isiah, one of Dixie's three husbands, went to talk to the clerk and she buzzed him back. A moment later, Priest came back and said that she was on some good meds.



“Kept asking the cop if she could use his handcuffs.” Priest grinned. “She’s definitely your child, Dixie.”



Laughing, Dixie declared that at least one of her daughters took after her. After her daughter’s men released her, the tiny woman moved to the large dark man. He stood and lifted her up in a strong hug.



“She'll be okay.” Dixie whispered as he held her close.



Four years ago, when he was overseas with the Navy, he filed for emergency leave and flew home for his adopted sister. He didn’t care that they had to lie to the government and the Navy. His Little Eves needed him, and he would be there.



A few years later, her brother, Law, had been stationed in Maine. Darkness had only been a few hours away. When Isiah brought a very depressed Evie to stay with her brother, he called their old friend. They took turns staying with her and keeping her safe until she was through the darkness that the two men knew well.



The two presidents spoke and then Roscoe and his wife sent most of the Renegades to the local clubhouse. Zydeco ordered all his men to go also, they had all been up for over twenty-four hours.



Pulling into the large compound for a converted hotel with tan colored bricks and black trim around the windows and doors, Darkness was surprised by the size and, for the lack of other words, amenities. There was a sign pointing to the pool, a multi-story parking garage and what looked like a gun range at the back of the property.



But the real surprise for him would come once he was inside.



Sensing the protective spirits, Darkness closed his eyes and listened.



“You good?” Zydeco asked and his adoptive son nodded.



“The spirits are worried.” Darkness said looking at the man who raised him.



“Good spirits? Or…”



“Do you know Coon? Or Sinner?”



Zydeco shook his head. “No, but they call this Sinner’s Shack.”



Nodding, Darkness grinned. “Yeah, says it’s his.”

1kli529,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyWebsite/comments/1kli529/midjourney_builds_websites_the_shocking_truth/,Midjourney Builds Websites?! The SHOCKING Truth...,"Can Midjourney Design Websites? A Comprehensive Guide
-----------------------------------------------------

Many people hope AI tools like Midjourney can just build a whole website with one click. I must tell you, this is not the case right now, and it causes some sad faces. I am a person who studies **Midjourney**. This tool is an **AI art generator**. It makes very interesting pictures. The big question many ask is: can **Midjourney design websites** all by itself? The answer to this is not a simple yes or no. Midjourney cannot write the computer language, the code, that makes a website work. But, the pictures it creates are truly changing **web design workflows**. These images are becoming very important. This article will explain everything. I will show how Midjourney can be a helper for web design. We will look at what it cannot do. Also, I want to think about what this means for the **future of web design**. You will learn much about this topic.

I. Understanding Midjourney's Capabilities: Image Generation, Not Code
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You are likely asking, ""So, can Midjourney actually *design* a website?"" Let us look very carefully at this question. It is important to understand what this AI tool does best. The answer helps us use it in the correct way.

### A. Midjourney's Focus: Generating Visual Assets

Midjourney has one main job. That job is to make pictures. This AI is built to create art from words you give it. We call these pictures **visual assets**. It does not think about how a website menu should work. Instead, it thinks about how a picture should look. Its strength is in making new images, styles, and visual ideas. If you need a picture of a futuristic city, Midjourney can try to make it. If you want an image of a happy dog, it can generate that. This is its core work: creating visual things.

### B. Limitations: Inability to Produce Functional Code

This is a very, very important point. Midjourney cannot make functional code. It does not write HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. These are the languages that build a real, working **Midjourney website**. So, you cannot ask Midjourney to ""make me a website that sells shoes"" and get a full online store. It will give you pictures, maybe of a shoe store design, but not the store itself. This is a big limit. The AI makes the ""look,"" not the ""engine"" of the website. Understanding this stops much confusion.

### C. Examples of Visual Assets Midjourney Excels At

What kind of pictures is Midjourney good at making for websites? It can make many helpful **website visual assets**. For example, it can create beautiful **illustrations**. These can be for blog posts or for explaining a service. Midjourney is also good at making unique **backgrounds**. These backgrounds can make a website feel special. It can also design small **UI elements**. Think about ideas for buttons, or icons, or maybe a special kind of border. It gives you the visual idea. A human designer then needs to make it real and functional. It can give inspiration for logos too.

II. How Midjourney Enhances the Web Design Process: A Workflow Revolution
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even though Midjourney does not write code, it can still help a lot. It can change and improve the **web design process**. I see it as a new tool in the designer's box. This tool can make some parts of the job faster and more creative. It is a way to explore new **design ideas** quickly.

### A. Generating Mockups and Prototypes

Designers often need to show clients what a website might look like. Midjourney can help make early pictures of web pages. These are called **website mockups** or visual prototypes. Imagine you want to design a homepage for a new coffee shop. You can tell Midjourney: ""Homepage for a cozy coffee shop, warm colors, hand-drawn style, with space for a big picture."" The AI will give you some images. These images are not a full design. But, they are quick **visual representations**. They help everyone see the idea. This can save much time in the early stages.

### B. Creating Unique and Eye-Catching Hero Images and Banners

The top part of a website is often a big image or banner. We call this a **hero image**. It is very important because it is the first thing people see. Midjourney can create very unique and eye-catching **hero images**. Because Midjourney can make almost any style, these images can be very artistic or very specific to the brand. This helps a website stand out. A good hero image invites people to look more. **AI image generation for web** is strong here.

### C. Designing Custom Illustrations and Graphics for Websites

Sometimes, a website needs special drawings or graphics. Stock photos can be boring. **Custom illustrations** make a website feel more personal and unique. Midjourney can be a great help in creating these. A designer can guide Midjourney with prompts to get a certain style of art. This art can then be used across the website. It helps build a consistent visual identity. These graphics add personality.

### D. Improving UI/UX Design through Visual Exploration

Good **UI/UX design** means making the website easy and pleasant to use. Midjourney can help in the exploration phase of this. Designers can quickly generate many different visual styles for buttons, cards, or even whole screen layouts. They might ask for ""a dashboard UI for a fitness app, dark mode, neon accents."" Seeing many options can spark new ideas. It helps to iterate on **design ideas** much faster than drawing everything by hand or building it in a design tool from zero. This rapid visual exploration can lead to better user experiences because more possibilities are considered. It helps in finding a good visual language for the user interface.

III. Practical Examples and Case Studies: Midjourney in Action
--------------------------------------------------------------

It is good to talk about what Midjourney can do. It is even better to see some real examples. Let us look at how people are using **Midjourney images** in actual web design work. These examples show its true use.

### A. Showcasing Website Designs Inspired by Midjourney Images

I have seen many designers share their work. They start with an image from Midjourney. This image gives them an idea for the mood, the colors, or the layout of a website. For instance, a designer might generate a beautiful abstract landscape. Then, they use those colors and shapes to design a real website's front page. The **Midjourney website** itself isn't built by the AI, but its soul comes from the AI's picture. The AI provides the spark. The human provides the skill to build the **website visual** into a full design in tools like **Figma**.

### B. Examples of Prompts Used to Create Website Visuals

How do you tell Midjourney what to make? You use ""prompts."" These are word commands. Here are some simple prompt ideas I might use:

- ""Landing page design, e-commerce, minimalist, soft pastel colors, product showcase --ar 16:9"" (The `--ar 16:9` tells it the shape of the picture).
- ""Hero image for a travel blog, vibrant sunset over mountains, adventurous feel, detailed.""
- ""Set of icons for a mobile banking app, flat design, blue and green, simple and clear.""
- ""User interface for a music player, retro style, dark theme, cassette tapes --style raw.""  
    These prompts give Midjourney a starting point. **Designers using Midjourney** learn to write good prompts to get useful pictures. It is a skill.

### C. Case Studies: Designers Using Midjourney to Speed Up Their Workflow

Some design agencies and freelance designers are now using Midjourney every day. I read a story about a designer. She said she can make mood boards for clients much faster. Before, she spent hours finding pictures. Now, she uses Midjourney to create specific images that match the client's ideas. This speeds up her **workflow**. Another case study showed a team. They used Midjourney to quickly create many different visual concepts for a new brand. The client could see many options early. This saved weeks of work. This shows **AI design tools** can make work more efficient.

IV. Overcoming Midjourney's Limitations: Combining AI with Traditional Tools
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Midjourney is a helpful tool, but it has limits. We know it cannot code. It cannot understand user experience deeply. So, we must be smart. We need to combine its strengths with other tools and human skills. This is how we get the best results for **AI web design**.

### A. Using Midjourney Images in Combination with Web Design Software (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD)

This is the most common way to use Midjourney. A designer creates an inspiring image or element with Midjourney. Then, they take that image. They import it into a proper web design tool like **Figma** or **Adobe XD**. In these tools, the designer can use the Midjourney image as a background. Or, they can use it as inspiration for a color palette. They can cut parts of the image to use as assets. The real design work, like making layouts and interactive elements, happens in these software programs. Midjourney gives the art; Figma gives the structure.

### B. Leveraging AI-Powered Code Generators to Complement Midjourney Designs

Midjourney makes pictures. What if you want to turn that picture into some code? There are other new AI tools. Some are called **AI-powered code generators**. Some of these tools can look at a picture of a website design. Then, they try to write basic HTML and CSS code for it. This technology is still developing. It is not perfect. But, it can be a starting point. A designer could use a Midjourney image to create a visual. Then, they might use an AI code generator to get some starter code. A human developer must then check and improve this code a lot.

### C. The Importance of Human Oversight

This is very important. AI can help, but it cannot replace the human designer or developer fully, especially for complex tasks. A person must always check the work. **Human oversight** is needed to make sure the website design is good. Is it easy for people to use (usability)? Does it meet the client's goals? Does it work on all devices? Is the design consistent? AI might make a beautiful picture. But a human designer understands people and their needs. We need to ensure **design consistency and usability**, which AI alone cannot guarantee.

V. The Future of Web Design: AI Integration and the Rise of Visual-First Approaches
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What will web design look like in the future? I think **AI in web design** will become much more common. We are seeing a move towards tools that focus on visuals first. Midjourney is one part of this big change. The **future of web development AI** is exciting.

### A. Predictions for AI's Role in Web Design Over the Next 5 Years

In the next five years, I believe AI tools will become even better. They might help with more parts of web design. Perhaps AI will get very good at suggesting layouts based on content. Maybe AI can help check for accessibility problems automatically. I expect much tighter **AI integration** into the tools designers already use. The process could become faster. Repetitive tasks might be done by AI. This would free up designers to focus on creativity and strategy.

### B. The Potential for More Advanced AI Tools That Generate Both Visuals and Code

Right now, Midjourney makes visuals. Other tools try to make code. What if one tool could do both well? This is a big dream for some. It is possible we will see AI tools in the future that can understand a design idea and generate both beautiful visuals and good, clean code. This would be a big step. The line between creating a picture and building a website could become very blurry. These **generative AI for websites** could change many things. But this is likely still many years away for complex sites.

### C. The Importance of Human Creativity and Artistic Direction in an AI-Driven World

Even if AI becomes very powerful, human beings will still be very important. **Human creativity** is unique. Our ability to understand feelings, culture, and complex problems is something AI does not have in the same way. Artistic direction from humans will guide these AI tools. We will tell the AI what kind of feeling the website should have. We will make the big decisions. AI can be a very smart brush, but the human is the artist. The human touch, empathy, and strategic thinking will always be needed.

VI. Ethical Considerations and Best Practices When Using AI in Web Design
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we use powerful new tools like **AI in web design**, we must also think about doing it in a good and fair way. There are some important ethical points. We need to have best practices to guide us. This ensures we use **AI design tools** responsibly.

### A. Copyright and Ownership of AI-Generated Images

This is a tricky area. Who owns the pictures that Midjourney makes? Do you own it because you wrote the prompt? Does Midjourney own it? Or does no one own it? The laws about **copyright** for **AI-generated images** are still being made and are different in different countries. It is very important to understand the terms of service of the AI tool you are using. For commercial projects, this is a big concern. You need to know if you can legally use the image for a client's website. This is something I am always careful about.

### B. Avoiding Bias in AI-Generated Designs

AI models like Midjourney learn from huge amounts of data from the internet. If this data contains biases (for example, showing only certain types of people in certain roles), then the AI might also create **biased designs**. For example, if you ask for a picture of a ""doctor,"" will it always show a man? We must be careful. We need to check the AI's output for any unfair bias. We should try to guide the AI to create inclusive designs that represent everyone fairly. Actively working against **AI bias** is our job.

### C. Transparency with Clients Regarding AI Usage

If you are a designer using Midjourney or other AI tools to help create a website for a client, it is good practice to be open about it. **Transparency with clients** is important. Let them know how AI is helping in the process. Explain the benefits, like speed or more creative options. Also, be honest about any limitations or copyright matters. This builds trust. Most clients will appreciate knowing about the tools you use to give them the best work. Hiding it can cause problems later.

Conclusion
----------

So, we have explored much about Midjourney and websites. I want to summarize the main points. Midjourney cannot, by itself, *design* and build a complete, working website. It does not write the necessary code. That is a very clear point.

However, Midjourney is a very powerful tool for creating **visual assets**. These assets can greatly help and speed up the **web design process**. It can make wonderful **illustrations**, **hero images**, and give ideas for **website mockups**. It helps designers explore creativity in new ways. The future of **AI web design** will surely involve even more **AI integration**. The lines between making pictures and making websites might get closer. Perhaps one day, **generative AI for websites** will do even more.

I want to encourage you. Try using Midjourney. See what it can do for your own web design ideas or projects. Explore its potential. It is a tool that can open up new ways of thinking about visuals on the web. The **future of web design** is an interesting path, and AI tools like Midjourney are an important part of that journey.

Normani Parker

Lazily, i rolled out of the warm and cozy bed when I heard the sound of the marvelous alarm clock.

Note the sarcasm.

I slam my hand on my stupid alarm, yelling for me to go to school. I feel so lazy today. Who am I kidding? I feel lazy literally every day. I curled into a ball and went under the sheets, pressing my head on my comfortable pillow.

While letting out a disapproving groaned, l lifted myself up from the bed. After tying up my room, I dragged myself to the bathroom, slamming the door I turned on the shower, waited for it to get to the right temperature before taking off my pgs and hoping to shower, and ended up shaving my legs. Twenty minutes later, I came out with wet hair and a smile like vanilla.

I chose a blue jumpsuit that reached my mid-thigh and had a bow at the waist because I wanted to stand out. I applied a moisturizer to my face, then a little bit of eyeliner, making my blue eyes pop out, and also applied my strawberry lipgloss. I tied my medium blond hair into a ponytail, bringing out a little bit of hair on both sides of my face. I put on my black flats and walked out of my room to the kitchen to make a cup of coffee, adding two scoops of French caramel cream and two spoons of sugar.

Yummy.

I went back to the room to get my phone and a black bag with the coffee in it. I checked the time and saw that it was already 9:00 a.m. and my class starts by 10. I drank my coffee in a hurry, grabbing an apple and eating it . I didn't bother knocking on Stephanie's room because I knew she would be in school since she had an early class this morning.

I took my car keys from the counter as I stepped out of the house. I opened the car and quickly climbed in, putting my seatbelt on, then I started my car. I turned on my radio, turning the volume up as I heard my favorite Ariana Grande song, ""position,"" playing. Pulling out of my driveway, I started to head toward the direction of the university.

I found a perfect place to park. I quickly got down from the car as I brought out my phone to check the time, only to find out it was almost 10. I put my phone back in my bag before rushing into the school to get to my first class of the day.

♧♧♧

""Hey girl, how was class today?"" Steph asked as I stepped into our apartment. We have been best friends for ever and now we attend the same college. I am really grateful to Steph and her family. After my parents' death in a car crash when I was sixteen, Steph's parents took me in and treated me like a daughter. I don't know where I would be without them. They are like my second family.

""Mrs. Williams can be so freaking annoying. I don't know why she picks on me every time. "" I complained, plopping down on the couch beside her as I rested my back on the seat.

"" She's still a bitch to you. "" She asked, getting a nod from me. "" She seriously needs to get laid. I doubt her husband is doing a good job at it if she always comes in cranky,"" Steph replied. I scrunched up my face, not surprised at her response at all. "" Speaking of getting laid, it's Friday. Let's go clubbing. ""

""Nope, I have got an assignment to do and clubbing isn't just my scene,"" I said .

"" Come on, it will be fun, I promise,"" she begged, "" and you seriously need to let off some steam.""

""No, I don't.""

"" Please please please."" I turned to look at her as she gave me her best puppy eyes, knowing very well that I couldn't resist it.

""Fine,"" I sighed, earning a squeal from her.

""Great!, We'll leave by 7 "", we both stood up together, going into our various rooms.

I went into the bathroom to take a quick shower, washing off the day's stress. I toweled off and looked at the time; it was already 6:00. I was hoping to have a good nap before going out with Steph. I took my time blow-drying my hair.

After blow-drying my hair, I walked into the closet just to find out I had nothing to wear. I don't really go clubbing, so all I had were sweatpants, jeans, and cardigans. I started contemplating if I should go or not, but a knock at the door brought me out of my thoughts.

Stephanie walked into my room with two dresses on her hands, and they left me with nothing to imagine about.

"" Steph, where are we really going to?"" I asked out of curiosity.

""Okay, you caught me. There's this exclusive club for famous, rich, and powerful people, and I happened to score two passes,"" she replied excitedly.

"" Steph, I don't think this is a good idea. We are talking about a club that requires passes. "" I tell her I'm not really up for it.

""Don't worry, nothing bad will happen,"" she assured her, ""now come sit and let me get you ready.""

What have I gotten myself into?

After an hour of getting primed and plucked by Steph, she handed me a black short dress and heels that no doubt I would have trouble walking on. I put all my essentials in a tiny bag she gave me, and I must say she really outdid herself; I looked breathtakingly beautiful.

"" Are you sure that is me and not someone else?"" I asked, stunned as I stared at my reflection in the mirror.

"" It is you, Mani. I just enhance the beautiful features you have naturally."" She says back to me, ""Now let's go; we don't want to be late."" She grabs my hand and drags me out of my room towards the main door.

(M20),"We met at a party about a week and a half ago, I had gone up to him first and asked to kiss and we kissed about 9 more times before I asked for his number.
He agreed and we started talking and planned a date for last Thursday, we met up for coffee had a lot of really good conversations and we decided on going back to mine and ended up making out before he had to go home to help his parents.
We’ve been talking pretty regularly (everyday) since then however he has a problem where he can sometimes take hours to respond to my texts but will respond to my snaps or instagram reels while leaving me on delivered. 
He would also leave me on delivered but respond to my tit pics I’d send via Snapchat which kind of threw me off but hey it’s whatever.
I had asked if he was busy this upcoming weekend since I’m off Saturday and work the morning shift Friday so if he wanted to have a date and spend the night I’d be available, he said he’d love to and will let me know if he has any plans. 
Yesterday we had a long talk about how sometimes talking stages can be overwhelming for him and how he needs space and time and i expressed that I understand and if he’s overwhelmed and needs to cancel a date just let me know and I’ll understand, he also expressed that it takes a while for him to consider seeing people seriously and I’m not at that point yet. I expressed I want to take things slow and get to know him before jumping into anything and we both agreed on that. 
Here’s where it’s confusing, I had to go home to visit my mom for Mother’s Day and would be in his area (he lives an hour away from my college) and asked if he wanted to meet up and get coffee, he agreed and said he’d love to and let me know if he has any plans, that was Saturday night, he didn’t update me about it and so I presumed it was still on and got him flowers while shopping today and I texted him around 4 asking how his day way, I got no response and decided to double text at 9pm asking if he still wanted to get coffee this morning, he didn’t respond until almost 11 apologizing saying he had a friend over and that’s why he didn’t respond but couldn’t get coffee due to watching his brother for his parents, I asked if he still wanted to go on our date Friday and he didn’t respond (and still hasn’t) but responded on snap to the tit pics I sent prior to him canceling and he called me “perfect”, and so I sent him a snap of the flowers I got for him and said “since couldn’t give them to you I’d figured you’d still like to see them” and he just said “ awww those are beautiful”, and still hasn’t responded to my text about out date.

Now one Company reached out and asked nicely if we got an idea or can help and i came up with the fix (just turn it back on doesnt matter how registry/gpo/intune pick your favorite tool) and the matter didnt even make it to the Ticket/change request and was resolved within the hour. Here comes Company B with a total of 3 arrogant young IT-Support workers now accusing us for 3 weeks and counting that we did turn that setting off on purpose. The issue has been brought up by them every single week in our weekly meeting and they havent even tried any fix yet and they dont even know it was the update (24H2 classic at this point). Its important to mention that they have full rights to make those configuration changes for their Company themself on all Devices/Users without Sysadmin Action needed at all. The question is since they are constantly full Guns blazing at accusing instead of asking how long would you keep them in the dark before just fixing it.

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the **pack** house, balancing a tray of **breakfast** plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday–my eighteenth–the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack **was** riddled with hardships and misery. 

“Do you phn on making me wait all morning. Auren!” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room. 

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty–three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty–seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the amwual mating ball about a **year** ago. 

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the **Luna soon**. She carried herself **like** it, with a **sharp** tongue and a sharper glare. 

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.” 

“It’s coming, Maris–I stopped myself, flinching, “I’ll get it right away.” 

Her lips **curved** into **a** cruel sneer. “See **that** you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me 

The other **maids**, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, **a** sycophant, that me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning” 

“Right.” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this **pack** already. You should be grateful **she** even lets **you serve** her.” 

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes\*\*,\*\* of course.” 

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my **tracks**. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna **Maris** to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn’t a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna. 

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about **how they** all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. **Usually** everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me. 

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, **gray** eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine! 

“It’s just another **day,”** I whispered to myself. “**Keep** your head down, and it’ll be **fine.”** 

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest. 

**After** delivering the late and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I **related** to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with **a** hint of musk. My pulse **quickened**. My heart thundered. 

The words **of** my wolf, **Siena**, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and **terrifying**. The mouthwatering scent tugged **at** me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the **hall**. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out **everything** else around me. It was so strong and Intoxicating that I couldn’t think of **anything** else. **All** my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it. 

“That’s **our** mate! Siena **said** enthusiastically. “Go **fast**. I want my mute.’ 

The scent grew stronger **as** I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd. searching for the source. And then **I** saw hum… 

Alpha **Bram** Thome.

1klhuq7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1klhuq7,What's my next Jinhao?,"I've been gradually growing my Jinhao sub-collection like a lot of you who can't help but get sucked in by the great value they offer. 

The checkered one is the x750. That was the first one I bought and it is not without its flaws. The size 7 nib writes two broad from my liking and very annoyingly the cap does not post without flying off eventually. It is a pretty wet writer which I do like and there is a nice bit of spring in the clip. 

Next I bought the Shark. I love this pen it is so much fun and great value all day long for the couple of Euros I paid for it. The fine nib that I got writes more like a medium in my opinion which is not a bad thing for me. You could easily pick up several of these in different colors or even just to give away. 

Lastly I have the Jinhao 82 with a fine nib in so-called transparent coffee color. I know this pen is meant to ape a sailor pro gear which I have never had the pleasure of trying. I was surprised how stubby this pen is, it's the same size as a Kaweco sport so very much in the pocket pen category. The nib writes beautifully though - probably the best nib of the three pens. It's soft and I really like writing with it. I was hoping for the body to be finished in a better quality material though. This one feels the cheapest to me and the coffee is more like a speckly see through orange.

So my big question is ... What other Jinhaos am I sleeping on? I think I'll try an X159 next, are there any others that are must haves?",1,1747129514.0,fountainpens,1,0.67,False

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

""In the Court of the Philosopher Queen""
*By Elena Marin, for Art//Tact Magazine

What does it mean to be a queen when your kingdom has crumbled? Jemima Stackridge— Professor , philosopher, and avant-garde performance artist—offers a haunting and radiant answer in her latest immersive work, The Palace of Queen Jemima.

Set within the decaying grandeur of an abandoned country house, the performance invited a small audience to step into the remnants of a monarchy dissolved not by violence, but by neglect—its Queen left barefoot, hungry, and wrapped in memory. It was not a play, nor an installation, but something deeper: an encounter with a living philosophy.

I arrived unsure, and left transformed. What began in quiet observation soon became an act of participation, as Jemima—inhabiting her 'Queen Jemima' persona with breathtaking commitment—drew us into her collapsing realm. One by one, audience members knelt, offered words, gifts, questions. She met each gesture with regal grace and razor-sharp insight. It felt less like theatre, more like a communion.

We wandered through her 'palace', pausing where the dust was thickest, where the silence pressed. As afternoon light slanted through broken windows, we listened to her speak of abandonment, attention, and authority—not as abstract ideas, but as lived truths. By nightfall, the house itself seemed to breathe with the intensity of the shared experience.

Then, just as the darkness settled and reality began to waver, Jemima rose. ""It is time,"" she said softly, ""for the Queen to return to her bedroom."" With that, she led us—her loyal, bewildered court—back across the threshold of the Jemimaverse. We emerged not with answers, but with coffee and cake.

There, in the dimly lit hallway, a member of her support crew placed a tiara upon her head and wrapped her in a thick wool shawl. The moment was subtle but electric. The Queen was no longer exiled—she was restored, revealed anew as the University’s ‘Philosopher Queen’. It was closure, yes, but also coronation.

Rarely have I witnessed such a profound merging of performance, philosophy, and humanity. Jemima Stackridge has not only created a world—we were lucky enough to be invited to dwell inside it, if only for one unforgettable winter afternoon.

I think it's especially relevant now with all the talk around AI, UBI, and digital nomads. 

Here's my description for the event: 

""[Bertrand Russell’s 1932 essay](https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/) makes three bold claims:  
1. Most people could work less and still do fine if productivity gains were shared.  
2. Leisure, not constant work, is the well-spring of culture, science, and happiness.  
3. The prevailing “virtue of hard work” is a social myth that helps keep power and wealth in the same hands.

Are these claims, written almost 100 years ago, still relevant today?

Let’s get together, have a coffee, and talk about how Russell's ideas connect to the rise of AI, the four-day week, digital nomads, and what work could look like in the future.

You can read the essay [here.](https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/) You can read it in one seating, it's not very long.""",3,1747128981.0,Bangkok,2,1.0,False
1klhpxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/1klhpxy/in_celebration_of_the_podcast/,In celebration of the podcast,"Hey Atrioc fans,

You probably know the famous inside joke in the Atroic community where Atroic is a “Coffee Cow” supposedly stating the he is a cow for coffee. This of course, is the pinnacle of comedy, and will be the magnum opus of humanity throughout its entire history on this planet. However, I would like you all to consider a new joke to make about Atrioc. Perchance.

Here is my idea for a joke: Atrioc is a “Lemonade Lizard”. The joke here is that it’s saying that Atrioc really likes lemonade, and in fact, is a “lizard"" for it.

Now, I don’t know Atrioc’s actual opinions about lemonade, but nevertheless, it could be funny to bring it up on stream. We can consider two outcomes of this joke:

1. Atrioc is not a fan of the “Lemonade Lizard” joke

If Atrioc does not like the joke, he will tell chat statements such as “no chat I am not a lemonade lizard” and “no, please, not again” which will hopefully trigger his Nam flashbacks. By telling his chat that he doesn’t like the joke, the chat will not follow his directions and keep repeating the “lemonade lizard” joke to annoy him, generating more content.

2. Atrioc is a fan of the “lemonade lizard” joke

If Atrioc does like the joke, he will play into the bit, repeatedly calling himself the “lemonade lizard”. Chat will also play into the bit, such as like they did with “the smoothie king”.

I believe this joke has a lot of potential. Think of the things we could have by using this joke. We can have a “LemonadeLizard” emote, leeches can use this joke in their videos, and Ludwig has a new thing to call Atrioc now! The #1 thing that we should do is repeat this joke nonstop for 1 Lemonade Lizardillion years. I think doing that will be extremely beneficial to the Atrioc community. Perchance.

I hope you all consider this, and decide what’s better for all of us.",4,1747128949.0,atrioc,0,1.0,False

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the **pack** house, balancing a tray of **breakfast** plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday–my eighteenth–the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack **was** riddled with hardships and misery. 

“Do you phn on making me wait all morning. Auren!” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room. 

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty–three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty–seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the amwual mating ball about a **year** ago. 

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the **Luna soon**. She carried herself **like** it, with a **sharp** tongue and a sharper glare. 

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.” 

“It’s coming, Maris–I stopped myself, flinching, “I’ll get it right away.” 

Her lips **curved** into **a** cruel sneer. “See **that** you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me 

The other **maids**, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, **a** sycophant, that me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning” 

“Right.” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this **pack** already. You should be grateful **she** even lets **you serve** her.” 

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes**,** of course.” 

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my **tracks**. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna **Maris** to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn’t a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna. 

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about **how they** all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. **Usually** everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me. 

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, **gray** eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine! 

“It’s just another **day,”** I whispered to myself. “**Keep** your head down, and it’ll be **fine.”** 

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest. 

**After** delivering the late and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I **related** to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with **a** hint of musk. My pulse **quickened**. My heart thundered. 

The words **of** my wolf, **Siena**, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and **terrifying**. The mouthwatering scent tugged **at** me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the **hall**. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out **everything** else around me. It was so strong and Intoxicating that I couldn’t think of **anything** else. **All** my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it. 

“That’s **our** mate! Siena **said** enthusiastically. “Go **fast**. I want my mute.’ 

The scent grew stronger **as** I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd. searching for the source. And then **I** saw hum… 

Alpha **Bram** Thome. 

**I** couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. **Shock** mingled with awe. The **world** around me failed as irresistible desire rippled through me. A **deep** sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul 

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration **as** he **demonstrated** a fighting move. The sunlight caught **the sweat** on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly. 

My breath hitched **as** our eyes met. Hope swelled in my cheat when I saw recognition in **his** eyes. This was it. My mate. **My Alphs**. He **was** going in pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him. ",1,1747128727.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

Kinks : Cheating, Homewrecking, Degradation, Cuckold and more!

Story :
I’d been married a few months, still getting used to the whole “good wife” bullshit, when we headed to my cousin sister’s destination wedding in Jaipur. She’s my Uncle’s daughter, my Dad’s younger brother, and that man had always been trouble. He was the cool uncle, lean, rugged, with that cocky grin and a vibe that screamed how adventurous he was..We’d always had this flirty thing going, harmless winks and teasing comments, but nothing serious. I’d catch him eyeing my ass in sarees, and I’d laugh it off, tossing my hair, thinking it was just fun. 

**Until the Haldi night!**

The booze flowed hard, whiskey, cocktails, the works, and everyone was smashed. The music was loud, the air thick with turmeric and lust, and I was tipsy, swaying in my lehenga, when I caught him staring again. This time, he didn’t look away. Late that night, after the chaos died down, we ended up alone near the poolside bar, laughing about dumb shit. Then he grabbed my wrist, pulled me into the shadows, and growled, “You’ve been fucking with me too long..you’re such a tease..” I didn’t even blink, just smirked and pressed my tits against him, whispering “oh ya? Do something about it!”

We stumbled into a spare room, ripping at each other like animals. He yanked my blouse off, sucking my nipples hard while I clawed at his kurta, freeing his cock. He was thick, throbbing, and I was dripping for it. He shoved me onto the bed, flipped my lehenga up, and rammed into me, no mercy, no foreplay, just raw, nasty fucking. I moaned like a whore, legs spread wide, begging him to go harder. “You’re such a slut!” he grunted, slapping my ass, pounding me till the bed creaked. I came screaming, and he unloaded inside me, both of us panting, sweaty, and fucked out. 

Afterward, we stumbled back to reality, him to his wife, me to my husband, swearing it was a one-time thing, a dirty secret we’d bury.

Yeah, right! The rest of that wedding turned into our personal fuck fest. While my cousin was off getting married, we were sneaking into bathrooms, stairwells, anywhere we could. The night of her suhagraat, while she was upstairs with her new groom, I was in a hotel room two floors up, bent over a table, moaning “Ahh Uncle..fuck me!” as he railed me from behind. He gripped my hips, snarling “I’m addicted to this slutty little cunt now, your aunt’s got nothing on you….” I laughed, pushing back on him, telling him to pound me like the filthy bitch I was. We fucked till dawn, him choking me, me riding him, both of us high on the taboo rush.

The wedding ended, but the craving didn’t. Back home, we couldn’t stop. We’d meet up for “coffee dates” that were just excuses to fuck in his car, or “work trips” where I’d blow him in a cheap motel while he groaned about leaving his wife. Mini vacations became our thing, Goa, Lonavala, anywhere far from prying eyes. He’d tie me up, spank me raw, fuck my ass while telling me I was his perfect little whore. One night, balls-deep in me, he growled, “Let’s run off, somewhere no one knows us. I’ll wanna make you my wife..” I laughed, cumming on his cock, teasing, “You’d ditch her for this me?” He just smirked and fucked me harder, like he meant it.

We built a double life, me playing the doting newlywed, him the dutiful husband, but behind closed doors, we were animals. Hotel rooms, backseats, even his office once, I’d show up in a saree with no panties, and he’d bend me over his desk, telling me I was his real bride. The thrill of almost getting caught made it hotter. My husband started asking why I was “distant” his wife noticed his late nights, but we didn’t care. Until it all crashed down.

One day, my husband followed me to a “date.” Saw me climb into Uncle’s car, saw us kissing like horny teenagers. All hell broke loose, screaming fights, parents dragged in, his wife throwing plates, my Mom crying about “shame.” They found out everything, the trips, the sex, the way he’d call me his “wife” while fucking me senseless. Divorce papers flew, families split, and the gossip spread like wildfire.

What happens next is entirely up to us. We can build the story as we like and move forward at our own pace.

So, yes, this is intended to be a long-term, detailed character-driven play. Please share your thoughts and ideas if you enjoyed the story!",1,1747128679.0,actressfantasyRP,1,1.0,False

We have quite an erratic relationship, our main problem is that everything turns into an argument. He takes me saying that something he does eg when he drinks all my orange juice and doesnt tell me or replace it it annoys me and could he please buy more, as an attack of his character and goes into defence mode and gets angry/ upset. It’s always trivial things but things I should be able to express my feelings on to a 33 year old man. I went in to hospital to get surgery (non emergency) 2 days ago and they told me I was pregnant so I decided it would be best to postpone it until I’d made a decision on what to do with. I told my bf i couldnt get the surgery but didn’t want to talk about why just yet. He woke up in a terrible mood and lashed out at me literally just asking if he could make me a coffee while he was downstairs and asked me to leave his house. I broke down in tears and said that I was pregnant. He accused me of saying that to get an upper hand and ro make him get me a coffee. He said i had intentionally gotten mysekf pregnant to manipulate him and that he knew I wasn’t on birth control. I was, I was taking my pill on time every day but of course it’s not 100% accurate. He said I’d lied and trapped him and now I have to deal with the consequences. He told me to leave. I just stood there in shock and he got up and pushed me out his door (not forcefully he just led me by my shoulders) and then he locked the door behind me. I went home and he texted me and basically said hes sorry for kicking me out but it’s tough love and that if he didn’t I will assume he will do everything for me. I know keeping this baby is probably not a great idea but I just don’t know if I can get rid of it. It’s 3.5 months and basically a fully formed baby at this point and I just don’t know what to do.

im not sure if im bothered by the weight gain as much as the fact that i need so much food now?? before i quit, i would not eat before like 5pm. id get up, smoke 5 cigs, chug 5 coffees, take my adhd medication and that was it. break throughout the day = smoke. cant focus? smoke. tired? smoke. sad? smoke. celebrate? smoke. food? meh. ambivalent. didnt really need it. 

now i wake up and i need food. i have a break at work? food because my body needs it. celebrate something? food. cant focus? food because my blood sugar is low. 

and i know its good, i look a lot healthier and have A LOT more energy (like, its insane actually), but i dont like it. i dont like that im gaining weight and i dont like how inconvenient it is to have to eat, and a part of me looks at my friends that still smoke and thinks it would be so easy to just have a cigarette and avoid getting hungry to avoid eating. 

i dont have any other temptations to go back to cigs except the appetite control part of nicotine. and not in an eating disorder way, more in a ""thatsnmy old routine, and i miss it dearly because its comfortable and complacent and its hard to do new things all of the time (taking care of my body)"". i already eat healthy and work out, (ironically) health behaviours matter a lot to me. but yeah, idk. the temptation of smoking again just to avoid dealing with body signals (including tiredness, lack of focus, etc) is huge.

So I don't get the hate - is it from people who don't charge it until it's too late, or just blindly repeat what some ""influencer"" told them.

Anyways, and long story short, over a period of 10 years or so, I was onto my 2nd Magic Mouse, and wondered if I could save the mouse by repairing, and save me some money in the process  (*ngl, it's not as if they're cheap*).",2,1747128248.0,mac,0,1.0,False

1klhjll,https://www.reddit.com/r/backgammon/comments/1klhjll/tips_for_motivation_disillusionment_burnout/,Tips for motivation / disillusionment / burnout,"(Yes, this is r/backgammon, not r/therapy, I know...)

I started playing backgammon casually at home about two years ago. I really enjoyed the game and wanted to learn more and play it better. I bought a few books, read and enjoyed them, felt I was improving, and I joined my local club and played in a few local/regional tournaments. I play regularly online (BG Galaxy mostly) and I'm definitely not part of the 'dice are rigged' crowd.

Now, though, two years down the line, I am really struggling with motivation. I think part of this is because I didn't play many competitive sports/games as a kid but excelled in academics, so I focused on that (which came more naturally to me) and as a result I have a bit of an impatient streak if I'm not constantly improving at something. I tried to pick up golf a few years ago but I don't have the temper for it.

I'm a middling player - my average PR online is about 11. I'm not expecting to set the world on fire, but my tournament experiences and, recently, my online experiences, have been really negative. In all of the tournaments I've played I pay a significant amount of money to turn up and lose most or all of my games (in my very first tournament, I played 13 and won 2; in my second one I played 11 and won 3, two of which were in a consolation for players who lost their first three Swiss-format games and so didn't get to play the full five games).

I know you don't pay to win, but it always feels stupid walking away from a tournament (on one of my two days off a week) really tired, down a load of money and having spent hours watching games I thought I'd won slip through my fingers. It's not like I'm whining about luck either: knowing about cognitive biases, I specifically point out to myself games or rolls in/on which I'm lucky to try to negate my natural tendency to focus on bad luck.

The weird thing is I come home after a tournament and I haven't enjoyed myself. Now this is getting to me online - I'm in a really bad run at the minute (I've won 11 of my last 60 7-point games online - my overall win rate is about 49%) and I just can't seem to get out of it, and I'm really sick of it. I'm not playing particularly poorly and I feel I am improving, but it just feels like the game is against me - which I obviously can't control, given the significant role luck plays in this game. 

This morning, as I do most days, I played a few 7-point games with a coffee and settled down for what has become unfortunately common (3 7-0 losses in which I played with PRs of 6.14 (vs 9.11), 10.49 (vs 16.44) and 13.01 (vs 18.27). This morning's losses were particularly painful for some reason; it just doesn't seem to end and I think it's overwhelming me. I'm just desperate to have some good luck (or at least some not-bad luck) and to win some games.

I think this is poisoning my enjoyment of the game; I was supposed to play in a local tournament on Saturday, but I woke up that morning and decided I didn't feel like it. I like the people from my local club and I used to enjoy spending time with them, but I've come to associate the game with the negative experiences I've had, and I just didn't feel up to attending. I don't know if I'm overly attached to having to win to enjoy the game, or if it's something else. It just makes me sad that something I used to enjoy now makes me feel bad and I'm avoiding it.

Does anyone have any tips for getting out of a funk, relaxing a bit, enjoying the game more and being more patient/persistent when you're in a rough patch? I know that's what I have to do, but I don't think it comes naturally to me.",1,1747128189.0,backgammon,1,1.0,False

Wildlife fires last year affected some indigenous trees so the government started a program where they distributed seedlings of those plants on homesteaders to reforest the impacted land. However, the homestead I was in received their plants late at the beginning of the dry season, so, planting them in the mountains at this time means they will die. So, we decided to build nurseries for them to get them through the dry season and then reforesting the mountains. 

The place of this nursery used to have coffee trees that we removed (sorry didn’t take pics of them but they were an extension for the coffee trees you see behind.)

I texted her after asking when she’s free so we can go and she was like ‘oh you know you can take your gf it doesn’t have to be me’ and I was like noo but you got the tickets (and hadn’t been to the exhibit yet as well) so we arranged to go together.

We talked for a bit more but then she got a phone call and quickly had to go for mysterious reasons.

Coffee is more than a beverage, it's a global culture, a morning ritual, and a craft. Whether you're searching for the best coffee beans, exploring local coffee shops, or learning how to brew the perfect cup, this guide covers everything you need to know. Dive into the world of specialty coffee, discover coffee growing regions, and find tips for buying coffee online or visiting a cozy coffee shop near you.

# What is Coffee? Understanding the Basics

Coffee starts as a seed from the *Coffea* plant, commonly referred to as coffee beans. These seeds are processed, roasted, and brewed into the drink loved worldwide. From espresso to cold brew coffee, the types of coffee drinks are vast, each with unique flavors influenced by coffee varietals, coffee processing methods, and coffee terroir.

# Key Coffee Terms to Know

* **Coffee Beans**: The seeds of the coffee plant, roasted to create the beverage.
* **Specialty Coffee**: High-quality coffee with an SCA score (Specialty Coffee Association) of 80+ based on cupping score.
* **Single Origin Coffee**: Coffee sourced from one specific region, like Ethiopian coffee or Colombian coffee.
* **Coffee Roasters**: Artisans who roast green coffee beans to enhance flavor.
* **Coffee Types**: Includes espresso, latte, cappuccino, americano, flat white, and more.

# The Journey of Coffee: From Farm to Cup

# Coffee Farming and Cultivation

Coffee is-grown on coffee plantations in coffee growing regions like Brazil, Ethiopia, and Colombia. Factors like coffee altitude, shade grown coffee practices, and soil quality shape the coffee cherry's flavor. Coffee farming involves careful cultivation of coffee varietals such as Geisha, Bourbon, and Typica.

* **Coffee Altitude**: Higher altitudes (e.g., 1,200–2,200 meters) produce complex flavors, as seen in Kenyan coffee or Yirgacheffe coffee.
* **Coffee Terroir**: The environment, including soil and climate, impacts taste, especially in single origin coffee.
* **Coffee Harvest**: Hand-picked coffee cherries ensure quality in specialty coffee production.

# Coffee Processing Methods

After harvesting, coffee cherries undergo processing to extract green coffee beans. The method affects flavor:

* **Washed Coffee**: Clean, bright flavors (e.g., Costa Rican coffee).
* **Natural Coffee**: Fruity, bold notes (e.g., Ethiopian coffee).
* **Honey Process Coffee**: Balanced sweetness (e.g., Guatemalan coffee).

# Ethical Coffee Practices

Look for certifications like organic coffee beans, fair trade coffee, Rainforest Alliance coffee, or direct trade coffee. These support sustainable coffee cooperatives and farmers in regions like Honduras or Sumatra.

# Top Coffee Growing Regions

* **Colombian Coffee**: Balanced, nutty flavors from regions like Antigua.
* **Ethiopian Coffee**: Floral, fruity notes, especially in Yirgacheffe coffee and Sidamo coffee.
* **Brazilian Coffee**: Chocolatey, low-acidity beans from Mandheling coffee.
* **Kenyan Coffee**: Bright, citrusy profiles.
* **Costa Rican Coffee**: Clean, sweet flavors from Tarrazu coffee.

# Exploring Coffee Varietals and Tasting Notes

Coffee cultivars like Geisha (floral, tea-like) or Bourbon (sweet, caramel) offer distinct coffee tasting notes. During coffee cupping, experts evaluate aroma, acidity, body, and flavor, assigning an SCA score. For example, gourmet coffee beans often feature notes of chocolate, berry, or citrus.

# Buying Coffee Online: Tips and Recommendations

# Why Buy Coffee Online?

Purchasing coffee beans online offers convenience and access to freshly roasted coffee. From coffee subscriptions to bulk coffee beans online, you can explore gourmet coffee beans or specialty coffee from top online coffee roasters.

# Best Places to Buy Coffee Online

* **Trade Coffee**: A coffee subscription box curating beans from local coffee roasters.

So this was the first nursery I’ve made in a homestead in southern Ecuador and here is the short story behind it. 

Wildlife fires last year affected some indigenous trees so the government started a program where they distributed seedlings of those plants on homesteaders to reforest the impacted land. However, the homestead I was in received their plants late at the beginning of the dry season, so, planting them in the mountains at this time means they will die. We decided to build nurseries for them to get them through the dry season and then reforesting the mountains later in September.

The land of this nursery used to have coffee trees that we removed - sorry didn’t take pics of them but they were an extension for the coffee trees you see behind.

It was the first nursery I’ve ever made and thought I’d share it here as the feeling of touching the soil with my bare hands and planting the trees can be described with this emoji 🥹

Now we are in a long distance relationship for 6 months, but call every single day. 
I met his family early and they seemed very lovely, but also a little conservative. He knows I am sterilized and how and why and is overall totally supportive, a great listener and very very progressive in his mind and words.

When I last visited we ate breakfast and he told me about a car ride he had with his family, including his cousin (M30ish). The family teased the cousin on when he will become a father (haha... so funny) and my boyfriend seems to have laughed a little to hard. So his cousin clapped back, saying now that he has a girlfriend, wouldn't he be first?

My boyfriend then informed me that he told the whole car (aunt, uncle and two cousins) that I do not want children and I even had surgery done to ensure I could never get pregnant.

I almost dropped my cup of coffee and am still unsure what to think about it. At that time I assured him all is fine. He apologized and told me he knows his family and they wouldnt have stopped asking. But I still feel so weird about this.
I am openly telling people I do not want children. But really try to check their reactions and check if I am safe to tell them more. It makes me feel a little vulnerable that they know this much about me now.

I met them one time since and explained to my boyfriend that ""we are in a long distance relationship, children are not a priority"" is a perfectly good answer to shut people up in the future. Still, I feel vaguely hurt.

I would appreciate any tips. 4 years in college and I think I saw the dentist twice, one time for a small cavity and the second time just a check up with no issues. Also no pain or other complaints during that time.

I am now 5 years post graduating and my teeth are getting worse. I've started doing regular check ups + cleaning twice a year 4 years ago and I feel that since then, my mouth is giving me problems to bring to my dentists just because (like ""I'll give you a reason to go to the dentist so often""). I have old cavities that need to be fixed (which is fine), BUT I also have a bunch of new cavities that have been fixed in the last 2-3 years (maybe 4-5) and I have about 2-3 more spots that my dentist is keeping track of that look like they could turn into cavities.

I quit smoking almost 2 and a half years ago, I have cut down on sugar by A LOT over the last year, I now stick to fruits unless I have a little treat like an ice cream or brownies (once a week, some weeks not at all). I also have never been a big drinker of sugary sodas (maybe 2-3 times a year, and usually in a mixed drink) and I've also cut down on my alcohol consumption by a lot. Maybe I have a drink or two 3-4 times a month and I'm considering stopping completely. Up until last year I avoided alcohol for 1,5 years because of different medical treatments (oral antibiotics for skin and adhd meds) and during that time I still had cavities.

I currently have 3 spots in my mouth that are sensitive - 1 is an old cavity but two are new ones that I will get fixed this week during my appointment. Whenever I ask my dentist, all he says is that I am prone to cavities and that it is what it is. I get that, but surely there are some things I could be doing to help protect my teeth a little bit better to slow down new cavities and not have to replace them by the time I'm 35. But he's not offering me any tips, all he says is brush and floss twice a day, which I am already doing. I always have to do a lot of research by myself and when I bring something up, he says that they probably won't work bc of genetics and bc of the bacteria makeup in my mouth. But I can't just be expected to sit around and do nothing....

In terms of care,

* I use an electric toothbrush with sensitive bristles and with a red light to indicate if I brush too hard (I don't)
* Brush my teeth twice a day (and I make sure to brush my gums too, at a 45 degree angle)
* I floss am, pm and as much as I can after lunch too
* I've cut down on snacking so I have more than 2 hours in between meals to give my teeth/mouth/saliva rest
* I rarely drink coffee or black tea - I usually drink herbal teas and chai/matcha (the ones that taste like grass and soil, not the sugary ones)
* I always drink water after I eat or drink something and do a little swoosh
* I also have started chewing xylitol gum after eating because I read it can help with the ph of the mouth and make the mouth less acidic(?) I hope that's correct.

Other things that could impact my teeth:

* I tend to have a dry mouth, and I ALWAYS wake up with a dry paper-like mouth, no matter how much water I drink.
* I believe I may be mouth breathing during the night because I have a constant year round stuffy nose and no known allergies. I've just finished a month of corticosteroids nasal spray and it had zero effect on me, I have to go back to my gp and explore other possibilities.
* Both my lower and upper front teeth are pushed forward because of my tongue. I realised last year that my tongue is resting behind my frontal teeth and pushing them constantly when I swallow. I have been training it to rest at the top and this is how I realised I've been mouth breathing a lot because I run out of air with my tongue like this. Once I fix my nose, and my tongue I will look into getting braces.
* My diet? But I do not even know where to start and what else I should avoid or cut back on.. I'm at a loss. I do not really eat a lot of processed food, I mostly cook at home (salads, pasta, rice, soups)
* I do not exactly grind my teeth but I do little taps/clicks when I sleep sometimes (so opening and closing my mouth very little and clicking my teeth) - and my dentist said there's no marks of bruxism on my teeth (yet)

Things I am considering (mostly that I came across while researching by myself, not dr recommended, so please let me know if it can work).

* Colgate or Elmex Duraphat 5000 (1.1% fluoride) - equivalent to 3m clinpro which I can't find here
* Biotene dry mouth oral rinse
* Oil pulling (I know it's questionable but at this point, I'll try black magic and start praying to fairies if it will save my teeth)
* Mouth taping at night (tho I am afraid I won't be able to breathe properly if my nose gets stuffy)
* Another dentist I saw while mine was on vacation suggested I eat dates in the morning and roll the pit around the roof of my mouth - she said it can help train my tongue and help me produce more saliva
* Changing my dentist

**Why I went to Malta & First Impressions**  
This was a total spontaneous trip – booked it Wednesday evening, flew out Thursday morning. I had to use up some overtime on short notice, saw a decent flight deal, and thought: *Why not trade Berlin grey for a bit of island sun?* No deep reason, just a quick escape.

So I landed in Malta and a few minutes later, I was already cruising toward Valletta. And honestly? First impression: fascination. The architecture grabbed me immediately – golden stone buildings, narrow alleyways, medieval vibes everywhere. With just a bit of imagination, you’re basically in a historical movie… with the occasional e-scooter zipping by.

**Getting settled & first steps**  
Checked into my place, dropped my bag, and went straight out to explore. Destination: city center, coffee, snack – you know the drill.  
Grabbed a Pastizzi (for less than a euro, bless them), got myself a coffee, and soaked up some sun. And honestly? The prices were super fair. None of that *“oat milk latte for €4.80”* Berlin madness. Everything felt relaxed, friendly, easygoing. After barely an hour, I was already in full vacation mode.

**Where I went**  
I tried to keep a good mix of touristy highlights and chill spots – here’s how my days roughly looked:

**Day 1** – Went classic to start: Mdina, Valletta, and St. Julian’s Bay (aka Paceville). Total tourist mode, but honestly? Fun. Day drinking by the water, a bit of sightseeing, and soaking up the atmosphere. Mdina was especially cool – felt like walking through a movie set. Valletta was full of energy. And Paceville? Let’s just say… you *will* hear reggaeton somewhere.

**Day 2** – Took it south to Marsaxlokk (I *think* that’s how it’s spelled – bless Maltese). More low-key, more local vibes. Beautiful little harbor town with fishing boats, fresh seafood, and way less chaos. It gave me that “landside chill” feeling – far from the city buzz.

**Day 3** – Island-hopping day! Took a trip to Gozo, Comino, and the Blue Lagoon – plus a few epic cliffs and rocky spots along the way (names forgotten, but trust me: they were pretty dramatic). Swam in that iconic turquoise water, jumped off cliffs like I was in a Red Bull ad, and visited a stunning church/fortress thing on Gozo that made me wish I knew more about architecture.

**Day 4** – Drove out west for some scenic views: checked out the Popeye Village (just the viewpoint, didn’t go inside), then went cliff-hopping along the coast. Found some amazing spots for swimming and just staring into the sea like I was questioning life (in a good way). Super peaceful, super pretty.

**Pros & Cons**

**The Pros**  
Malta actually surprised me in a lot of good ways:

* Prices were super reasonable – even in touristy spots, you don’t feel like you’re being robbed with every coffee.
* The people were nice. Like, genuinely friendly, not just “customer service smile” nice.
* Almost everyone speaks English. And not just “school English” – most locals were pretty fluent.
* The food? Amazing. Especially the seafood. If you’re into fish, this place is your playground.
* Fruits and veggies actually *taste* like something – way more flavor than I’m used to in Germany.
* You can go full “let’s get drunk and wild” mode *or* have a peaceful nature and culture trip – it works either way.
* Bolt rides are cheap and reliable – I used it a lot and it made everything super convenient.
* The weather was perfect (early May) – T-shirt weather during the day, light jacket in the evening. Couldn't have asked for better.

**The Cons**  
Of course, not everything was sunshine and dolphins:

* After two days, the architecture kind of blends together – beautiful, yes, but very… uniform. Felt like I was in a loop sometimes.
* Kinnie. Just… why? (Sorry Malta, I tried.)
* Infrastructure for pedestrians is rough. Sidewalks often just disappear, so I found myself walking on the road more than once.
* Most “Maltese” restaurants were run by people from India or Pakistan – nothing wrong with that, but it made the whole “local cuisine experience” feel a bit off. Found *one* place that was truly Maltese-run.
* Tried the famous rabbit dish – honestly? Overrated. I’ve had better in Germany. Stick to the fish, it’s where Malta really shines.
* Very little green. Especially in Valletta, it felt more like a well-built desert – beautiful stone everywhere, but not much nature in sight.

**Final Thoughts – Would I come back? Would I recommend it?**  
Honestly? I’d come back – but for a different kind of trip. I was traveling solo this time (shoutout to dating apps for unexpectedly becoming my personal tour guide – had a blast). But yeah, I could totally see myself returning with a group of friends for a more party-oriented or chill beach trip.

That said… I also feel like once is kind of enough. I saw a lot, enjoyed the vibe, but I’m not dying to go back right away. Malta is great for a short escape, some sunshine, good food, and a break from the everyday routine.

Would I recommend it? Definitely – as long as you know what to expect. Just don’t go looking for forests.",4,1747126838.0,malta,22,0.64,False

Users across Amazon use fast visuals to choose between numerous items and make well-informed buying decisions.

 The combination of visual aids through Amazon comparison images presents a major advantage to Amazon FBA sellers in the marketplace. Through clear presentation of differences and advantages and leadership attributes your images make customers identify your product as the superior choice instantly.

 Correctly implemented Amazon comparison images create immediate attention which leads to both higher credibility in your listings and more conversions along with separate listing positioning.

# Make the Design Simple and Neat

It should not be very difficult for you to figure out the easy comparison image. Amazon shoppers make purchasing decisions in a snap, literally, given they make purchasing decisions in seconds after viewing a product listing.

 Too much text, flashy graphics and distracting background in your comparison image make it hard for buyers to pick out the important differences between your product and the others.

It is about maintaining only the needed information in a structured manner to create a clean design. For instance, if you are selling a stainless steel water bottle, you have three main points that you could beat compared to: durability, insulation time, and leak proof design.

* Take away long descriptions under each feature and just simply write short, direct text like ‘Keeps Water Cold for 24 Hours’ instead of ‘Using high quality insulation our bottle keeps water cold for the whole day.’

It also makes the file more readable with a structured layout. Sections should be evenly spaced, and comparison points should be visually different from one another. 

The best side by side layout works best in this case as shoppers will be able to quickly differentiate between two products. Place no more than a few elements into a single image at once, so as not to overload the viewer.

* For instance, if you are comparing your water bottle to a plastic alternative, your comparison image should be so clear that there is visual cue on how different they are. 
* For instance, after dropping both a dented plastic bottle and your undamaged stainless steel bottle, you could show a real life image of the bottle on your left. Text based comparison of these graphs is much less effective than this kind of visual storytelling.

Also, try to stay away from colors, shadows, or decorative fonts that decrease the readability. Go for a minimalist design, use the white or light colored background where the product and the key text should easily be focused on. 

# High Quality Image for Professional Look

High quality images are associated with high quality products. It’s important that your comparison image is not blurry, pixelated or has low resolution product photos because it reflects unprofessionally and your brand as an unreliable one. 

Good images to communicate makes a customer feel that they can trust and also feel more credible which will persuade them to choose your product above a competitor’s product.

Make sure you always use high resolution product photos of your comparison images in order to look professional. Using your own professional product shots instead of stock images is the preferable course. 

* Take the screen protectors for a smartphone as an example; their comparison images will include close up, high resolution photos of two phone screens (with and without the protector). There should be a visual difference in clarity, brightness and sharpness to the buyer.

Image quality also depends on lighting. Well-lit images showcase the details of your product more effectively. When photographing your own products, use natural lighting or a lightbox to take the shadows out of your image and have evenly distributed lighting throughout the image.

Image format and resolution is another vital thing in keeping a professional look. Amazon suggests that images have at least 1000 pixels on the longest edge so that the zoom works properly. A comparison image should include all elements that are sharp and legible even when zoomed in.

Lastly, don’t use heavily edited, unrealistic visuals because this can have customers think they’re misled. When your product is a kitchen knife, don’t show a metal cut if your knife is not made for this. False or overly hyped visuals can result in disappointed customers, bad reviews which would hurt your products reputation.

# It’s Important To Highlight Key Differences You Have That Matter To Buyers

When creating a comparison image it should not be remembered to make comparison on the characteristics influencing the buying decisions. However, some [Amazon FBA sellers](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-are-some-training-videos-for-new-amazon-fba-sellers/) often make a mistake of including details that matter little in the buyer’s choice. 

So for instance, if you are talking about the ergonomic office chair, do not say ‘it comes in various colors’, because it is a matter of personal preference. Instead, highlight differences in:

* Lumbar Support: Is lumbar support adjustable in your competitor’s chair, which they don’t do otherwise?
* The chair material quality: Do you have a breathable chair mesh, that you don’t? Some are made from cheap fabric.
* Weight Capacity: The amount of weight the chair can support often determines its durability, especially when it comes to a longer period of use.

Shoppers don’t want to just see real benefits, but rather, they expect real benefits that matter to them as they use products in their daily life. 

* For instance, if a better lumbar support available in your chair alleviates the back pain, share the comparison image of a user sitting on your chair with the proper posture and compare this to your competitor’s chair in which the user is not comfortable. Marked improvements in user experience are easy to articulate in comparison to a simple textual depiction on how your product makes a difference.

Also, side by side numbers or statistics help the customers understand the superiority of the product. An effective comparison image for your product, if it were a portable charger, could look like:

* Your charger: 20,000mAh – Charges Phone 5x
* Competitor: 10,000mAh – Charges Phone 2x

Since these numerical differences are clear, shoppers can easily tell why your product is the better choice.

# Contrasting Colors Are Better For Better Readability

Color contrast is critical when designing Amazon comparison images. Choosing the right colors helps to highlight important product features and thereby make it easier to read for the buyers.

Readability is achieved with white text on a black background or with dark text on a light background. Bold, contrasting colors such as red and green can be used in a strategic manner as well. An example is to use:

* Green checkmark for strengths
* Red cross for weaknesses

In doing so, this instantly communicates which product has better values. Comparing your earbuds which have 20 hours battery life with one of your competitors which most probably has 8 hours of battery life in either bold text or green and red highlights will assist shoppers in making a decision in less than a second.

Nevertheless, avoid vivid neon colors and rich backgrounds that will impede readability. Use professional, Amazon approved colors such as:

* White or light gray backgrounds
* Black, blue, or dark gray text for clarity
* Green for positive features, red for disadvantages

The most crucial component of your comparison image should be a well-balanced color scheme that ensures the important points in the image are easily usable without distracting the viewer from your product.

# Use Check Marks and Crosses to Simplify Comparisons

It is quite common for shopping clients to make decisions in a matter of seconds after seeing a product listing. To communicate your product’s benefits quickly to the client, one very effective way to achieve this is by using green checkmarks (✅) and red crosses (❌) in a comparison image. 

This way of doing product comparisons very simply demonstrates how you are a better provider than your competitors thus making it easier for a customer to decide on something to buy.

* For example, suppose you offer a robot vacuum; a comparison picture may include the main functional differences of self-charge capability, HEPA filter inclusion, and runtime. What do you think about a simple yet effective design like “Self-Charging: ✅ | Competitor: ❌” and “HEPA Filter: ✅ | Competitor: ❌” with a straightforward layout? Online buyers usually browse rather than read every word, so such a straightforward visual format is meant to understand at a glance.

To reach the desired outcome, it’s essential that the written content is larger than or at least equal to the font size of one “capitalized” typeface, in capital letters. The distinctiveness of being “bold” will be mainly in its physical dimension.

 The reason for requiring such a big font is that people usually do their Amazon-related work on their mobile phones. The readability factor thus remains a critical factor. 

Firstly, you should care that the difference between your text and symbols and those of your competitors are their smallest and recognizable proportions, don’t you think? 

People will not send this part of the process directly to the product page if it is too small. In addition, enhancing the clarity of differences using clean and uncomplicated designs is the other side of the “comparison” sword, proceeding to the purchase is very expensive.

# Keep Text Short and Direct

Shoppers on Amazon are not usually the type of users who do thorough investigations of attributes in lengthy product descriptions among various images. In fact, they tend to look for important straightforward information to quickly confront the fact and buy the product. 

Conversely, putting an image with many, long sentences as well as non-related and elaborated points in one area would not probably be the best approach. Preference should then be given to short phrases which would instantly take in the substance of the advertisement.

* For instance, in the case of a smartwatch, an excellent comparison image should highlight crucial differentiators, like battery longevity, water resistance, and the ability to monitor heart rates. A simple and focused method such as “Battery Life: 24H vs. 8H” or “Waterproof: Yes vs. No” will allow customers to be able to compare the quality of various products without further explanation. 
* Instead of saying that “Our smartwatch lasts 24 hours on a single charge, whereas the competitor’s only lasts 8 hours”, using “Battery Life: 24H vs. 8H” makes the image more powerful.

This approach is particularly advantageous for mobile users as it does not drown them in excessive text. By ensuring that the most pertinent selling points are clearly visible right away, Amazon FBA sellers can improve user engagement and encourage conversion.

# Ensure Accurate and Honest Comparisons

Nevertheless, while pointing out the benefits of a product is important, overestimating its functions or making deceptive claims can have a negative effect on the brand in the long run. 

Customers prefer honesty, and if they feel misguided, it can cause bad reviews, returns, or even grievances that might damage the [Amazon FBA seller’s](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-mws-keys-essential-for-fba-sellers/) integrity. Furthermore, Amazon has strict regulations against misleading statements, and non-compliance can result in suspension of the listing.

* For instance, if a running shoe weighs 200 grams, proclaiming it as the “lightest shoe ever” without any industry-wide data can be a gamble. Instead, it is better to make a comparison image that shows some factual differences such as “Weight: 200g vs. 300g”, where customers’ opinions on which one is better would be based on real differences seen by them.

 Moreover, by providing actual, verifiable disparities, sellers build credibility and maintain their account status with compliance with Amazon policies.

# Use Side-by-Side Product Shots for Visual Impact

One of the limitations with plain words is that they seldom can communicate all the beneficial features or characteristics of a product. By showing side-by-side photos of the real things, one can note the outstanding differences in a zealous and persuasive way.

 That is one of the best techniques that one can use to show a product’s features like its robustness, size, or any improvements in the quality of the product.

* So for instance, when advertising a water-consuming appliance, it will be quite effective to place an illustration of a water bottle filled through a filter and a competitor’s one that is cloudy from hard water minerals besides it. 
* The customer can see the good performance of the filter the product has by just looking at the pictures. Likewise, a stain removal agent could also be promoted using a picture taken before and one taken after the cleaning process to depict how effective it was on the surface.

For the most impact, it is crucial the pictures of the product to be of high resolution and well-illuminated so that it is very easy to observe the differences. This method helps in enhancing credibility and creating an entertaining experience for the participants, thus building strong connections with potential customers.

# Incorporate Real-World Use Cases

When customers get a real-world example of a product’s usage, it makes them connect with it better. You can draw stronger emotional and rational appeals by not just stating features but by also having everyday demonstrations.

* For example, when demonstrating the product of noise-filtering headphones, you could use two people: one who is totally enjoying his music in a busy café and the other who is unable to hear any sound and only the noise of the other customers is visible. This transformation in the product’s evaluation is a clearer way for them to see how it can benefit them in the actual world.

Incorporating applicable use cases into comparison visuals allows sellers to forge a more substantial relationship with their customers, thereby rendering it simpler for them to picture how the product can make a difference in their existence.

# Highlight Warranty or Customer Support Differences

Warranties and customer support for products remain two significant parameters that affect the purchasing process, particularly, in the case of electronic or major appliances where the price tag is higher.

 In the forefront, comparison images should disclose the ability of the product to be one of those for which have longer warranties or also good customer support especially when the product is of high price.

* A comparison wherein the seller is offering a 2-year warranty as an advantage against the competitor’s 6-month warranty should be emphasized. A comparison image that proclaims “Warranty: 2 Years ✅ | 6 Months ❌” instantly assures customers that they are investing in a safer product. The difference in the support features stated like “24/7 Customer Support ✅ | No Support ❌” would give an extra layer of trust.

The strategy of this could not only make the product more trustworthy but also help to place it as a better option increasing the rate of conversion.

# Optimize for Mobile Viewing

A great many Amazon consumers search for and buy products through their mobile phones. Abiding therefore by a mobile-friendly design is the most paramount element of a comparison image. 

Comparatively, smaller text, over-crowded designs, and too many details can all make it difficult to discern the images on a smaller screen making them much less effective.

[Amazon FBA sellers](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-does-the-new-seller-guide-affect-amazon-fba-sales-in-90-days/) should come up with mobile-friendly comparison images by using bold font types, uncomplicated graphical representation, and not against resizing the words for a smaller screen to accommodate more stuff in a photo. 

* For example, by the occasion of selling pet brushes that groom the animals, one can make an infographic with the headings, “Yes, Gentle Bristles: ✅ | No, Harsh Bristles: ❌” and “Yes, Pain-Free Grooming: ✅ | No, Causes Discomfort: ❌.” The consideration of increasing clarity on mobile platforms and involvement will in the end increase customer interaction and comprehension.

# Showcase Certifications and Safety Standards

The importance of certifications in the perception of the credibility of a product is appreciated. This is one of the three important factors by which the shoppers mainly judge the quality.

 The comparison images should be the ones with a big size for the products that have all the certification such as USDA Organic, FDA Approved, or CE Certified.

* If you are selling organic baby lotion, a comparison image that states “USDA Certified Organic: ✅ | No Certification: ❌” instantly distinguishes it from non-certified alternatives. The majority of safety-conscious consumers prefer certified goods instead of those that are not.

Inclusion of certifications in comparison images enhances the product’s credibility and establishes potential buyers’ trust in the seller.

# Demonstrate Durability Through Visuals

When the feature of durability is a significant selling point, it should be presented visually, and not only in textual form. Being exposed to a product that demonstrates its ability to resist severe conditions has a more persuasive impact on a potential client than reading about it.

* For instance, if shockproof phone cases are sold, putting a strong comparison image in the selling process that one phone case survives a drop test while a competitor’s case like a cracked one under the same conditions. It is marketing through visual proof that suggests the reliability of the product and plays a vital role in the purchase decision.

# Use Infographic-Style Comparisons for Clarity

Network products are quite different and there is often confusion caused between them. [Amazon Infographics](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-infographics/) style comparison comes in handy here. And it helps the tech industry, especially with multiple feature comparisons, to be easily digestible.

* For instance, in the case of a fitness tracker one could create a comparison infographic that would showcase battery life, heart rate monitoring, and GPS tracking sections in an organized table manner. A well-structured layout allows customers to determine the principal distinctions without any ambiguity.

# Align with Amazon’s Image Guidelines

Amazon has very stringent rules about [product images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/are-your-amazon-product-images-speaking-directly-to-buyers-needs/) and any violation could lead to either a listing of the product being withheld or taken down. Competitors’ brand names or logos must not be included in the images.

 The comparison images must also have at least 1000 px resolution and they must not contain unreasonable assertions.

By strictly following Amazon’s regulations, sellers can use their boldness to produce persuasive, rule-adhering comparisons using images which will thus create product exposure and recommend an increase in sales.

# Displaying Before-and-After Results in Comparison Images

# Showcase Real-World Scenarios for Relatability

Before-and-after images can be made more useful by letting them reflect real-life situations that customers can relate to. If the comparison looks so set up or unrealistic, it can lead to the possible buyers getting disconnected from your promotional material.

 Realistic body language will highlight the vital aspects of the customer’s lifestyle in which the product fits in a way that the user easily simulates, increasing the purchase likelihood.

* For example, a vacuum cleaner brand may display a “before” shot of a carpet almost fully covered with pet hair, real dirt, and crumbs which is later by the perfect clean “after” photo showing the same rug. This not only gives an account of the proficiency of the product but also resonates with the comparison best with the pet owners and family-tied households. Instead of merely declaring boldness as a capability of the vacuum, the practical approach shows the action of this feature.
* Another example is a furniture polish brand that shows an old wooden table with scratches, stains, and dullness in the “before” image, followed by a brilliant, polished surface in the “after” image. This comparison allows clients to project their product usage scenarios and visualize, instead of just being mere assumptions made on generic claims the polarity of which is not real.

More specifically, the consumers of the day are often the same people portrayed in the before-and-after visuals of the campaign. For example, a teeth-whitening product may feature the “before” image as the stained teeth of a coffee drinker and the “after” image as those of the person with noticeably whiter teeth. 

This directly addresses the teeth discoloration problem of coffee consumers, making the change more relatable.

To increase credibility, applying real client photos in before-and-after images tends to fortify the aspect of relatability. The product’s genuineness is increased when shoppers see others like them achieving the goals that similar products promised.

 To boost the feeling of credibility and the fact that many others like them are also in the same boat, you may want users to submit actual before-and-after images with brief testimonials of their own.

By making sure that the transformations are talking through common matters and solutions, the before-and-after images become useful and allow for more emotional connections with buyers. In other words, a person is more likely to try a product if they can imagine themselves getting similar results.

# Guarantee That Differences Are Noticeable at a Glance

This is the way that a before-and-after comparison becomes successful, that is when the difference is perceptible right from the start. If shoppers have trouble telling which one’s the before and which one’s the after, the whole image is wasted.

 The change should be evident enough that the viewer, even if he just glances at the photo, can catch the improvement.

* For example, a weight-loss supplement can utilize an approach in which the data is shown in the way of a graphic. The initial state before the product is applied is shown to the side of the new dimension after its use with a clear decrease in the size. If the difference is insignificant, then focusing on the specifics of the change, such as an apparent reduction in the waist circumference, can help to realize the transition more obviously. In the absence of a general change, users may not believe in the power of the item they would like to buy.
* Likewise, a car headlight restoration kit would require a photo of a uniformed, yellowed headlight in the “before” scenario and a clearly seeing bright headlight in the “after” one. If the two images are not contrasting enough, then the effect of the enhanced image will be equal to none. Such instances as the angle change, the lighting change, or finally the cropping of the image in a way that it highlights the difference can be smart options to take up.

In such cases, the creators of e-commerce mobile platforms must take extra care to build satisfactory transformations. A shopper uses their mobile device for inquiring and once they find what they are looking for, she or he instantly moves on to browse other items. 

The devices differ significantly in size and resolution; therefore to guarantee the overview finishes fruitful one should see the image sizes supplied in the mockups with.

If the users are to trust the product, the changes should be shown visibly as in normal circumstances; For example, a kind of wrinkle remover should clearly reveal the difference between being untouched and treated. It is the only way to ensure that customers are aware of the improvement.

Optimized before-and-after shots give a significant lift in click-through and [conversion rates](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/7-tips-to-increase-amazon-conversion-rate-2022/) on Amazon. They would be inclined to try the product if they immediately recognized the difference with no hassle. This fact orders customer beliefs about product effectiveness and their actions of purchase. 

* For example, creators can use the above case. Just like normal people, these objects look different when they are in other places due to a lack of recognition. The maturation machines are repeated after such phases. A sample of before and after putting it on very dry skin showed it healing. The product should not be assumed to promote huge miraculous changes in the users that look not at all ordinary. 

Rather, it should look like it’s for women who had not sun-tanned. And such an easy job becomes difficult for them to believe. Because of that, they will not use it. If the user is afraid of being straight then she/he decides to purchase a product that facilitates this task. 

The only way to give her safety is to show her “Here I am, a girdle. Therefore, let someone see this ugly chair.” The message is unclear. And psychological factors are at play.

# Limit Over-Editing or Misleading Enhancements

Manipulating photos by correcting colors or cropping is standard procedure. Continuing with excessive manipulation can lead to disbelief. 

When customers feel that before-and-after photos are excessively altered, they immediately get suspicious and reject the product. This is the main reason they would not buy such a product. 

For customers, genuine representation is most important, and anything that implies digital alteration can result in doubts about the product’s reliability.

* To illustrate, the ideal image of a stretch mark removal cream must clearly display the way the stretch marks become lighter than before, rather than removing them completely through Photoshop. Too perfect transformations would make people think that the results are not true but rather artificial and not really achieved by the product. More of a realistic strategy is when stretch marks are less noticeable but are not totally gone and thus are more trustworthy.
* For instance, a teeth-whitening product that brightens the “after” image to an unnatural level can create the perception of manipulation. Instead, keeping the lighting and exposure levels of both images consistent so it appears real is possible.

Amazon’s rules are very strict about posting a fake image of a product and over-altering images can cause compliance problems. If customers feel misled, they can report the listing or write a bad review that deteriorates the brand’s credibility.

Utilizing images taken by actual customers can also help mitigate doubt. If real users post pictures of their results that are not changed, the authenticity ensures potential buyers. Having a disclaimer like “Results vary according to individual usage” also assists in managing expectations while retaining transparency.

By ensuring the representation of real life through [before and after](https://medium.com/@rochelle.ellul/before-and-after-c2f8119ebf29) images, customers will build trust and see the product’s claims as the truth. When transformations are represented truthfully, customers tend to be assured and make purchases confidently.

# Use Split-Screen Images for Direct Comparisons

The split-screen image layout combines before and after images into one easy-to-view format that has more impact.

 Instead of asking customers to scroll through two separate images, the split-screen format presents the “before” and “after” comparative states together, thereby making the comparison immediate and effective because of its visibility.

* For instance, a shoe cleaning product displays one half of the sneaker with dirt and the other part untouched. With this technique, viewers easily recognize the transformation while their focus is not diverted.
* A similar thing can be achieved for the cleaning spray brand by choosing a greasy stove top on the left and a clean, shiny cooking surface on the right. This way of comparison is visually simple, and makes the product’s cleaning power clear.

Split-screen images have a unique connectivity for mobile shoppers, hence, easy comparison is possible without the need for several clicks or extensive zooming.

 Customers are not only more likely to be inclined toward the product when they can see the change instantly but they will also tend to be more convinced by the product’s effectiveness.

# Use Clear and High-Quality Images for Instant Recognition

The image quality is what either hinders or helps a shopper notice a product’s transformation process. Vague, pixelated, or poorly lit images do not hold attention, thus making communication of the intended message difficult. 

Sharp and clear images help to ensure the buyer’s attention is captured at its fullest as the contrast of “before” and “after” is straightforward enough to see even if we are scrolling through the listing fairly fast.

* Consider, for example, the functionality of an acne treatment serum being sold by a brand in the online marketplace. It should be guaranteed that the images show and are representative of the color, texture, and impurities of the skin before and after treatment. 
* In case the customer’s skin in the “before” image was blurry while the “after” image was sharp, it is likely to cope with their doubts that the transformation is real. Professional photography is indeed important in this regard. An improvement in the results of before-and-after photos is guaranteed by using the right high-resolution camera, light, and a plain background.

Mobile shoppers require images that are much more detailed and perfect for lighting in order to distinguish those small changes. Numerous people shop on their phones on Amazon, so it is easy to miss an unclear before-and-after comparison, which diminishes its effectiveness. 

The clarity of product images, in addition to engaging users, is also instrumental in demonstrating a user’s product trust. 

* Having the right light settings helps in showing the subtle difference like hair color or night cream, for example, which ensures the transformation is evident and customers don’t have to zoom or squint to see the change.

In addition, optimization of the file size guarantees that the images load rapidly without any loss of quality. Prospective buyers might leave the webpage before proceeding with the product, which will ultimately frustrate them when the images are gradually appearing. 

Amazon, however, states that images are best presented with a white background, as they are more visible and professional. Following these tips could largely increase the conversion rates since the customers will prefer the products that are visually powerful and show good quality.

It is also vital that [Amazon FBA sellers](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/whats-an-amazon-fnsku-how-to-create-an-fnsku-for-fba-sellers/) make sure their products are in alignment with the Amazon guidelines as misleading enhancements or over-editing are to be avoided.

 If the overly touched photos look suspicious customers will suspect them to be fake and eventually leave negative comments if the product does not match the experience they had. 

Rather than an overly edited product, the brand should take genuinely photographed before-and-after pictures and let the viewers be the judge of the effectiveness.

By allowing imagination to be king and that interesting stories that truly shine and draw people to their image are kind of captivating, excited talking to their images too, more are becoming the bestsellers in the world of Amazon. 

Good strategy like this should be effective on its own anyway, while its customers are doing the heavy lifting, giving it a stunning smile and spotting it on a shelf. This type of marketing builds trust and also generates engagement leading to sales and favorable customer reviews.

# Consistent Background and Angle for Authenticity are Crucial

When it comes to playing after the quality of the picture, it is one of the most critical factors. Any change in the background, the light or the angle of the camera, can be misleading and create doubts in the mind of the buyer about the women and eventually product but not by them. 

Using an identical background allowed buyers to believe in the change brought about by the product instead of showing them just the different angles of the pictures.

* For instance, the model of a teeth-whitening product, in both “before” and “after” images should have the same background, lighting due to conditions, and the subject being in the same position. If the “before” photo has to be shot in low light while the “after” photo, even in daylight, is very different; customers may think that this change is due to artificial light and not the product itself. 

This can lead to distrust and prevent conversions. An environment where one has control over the light conditions would remain the same to produce an image representing the product at its true effect.

* One of the most frequent blunders made by Amazon FBA sellers is employing different angles for the “after” image. In case the angle of a customer’s grin in the teeth-whitening kit “before” image is very different from that in the “after” photo, it might look designed to manipulate the transformation purposely. The customer can assess the transformation with the assurance that the angles are equal.
* A skincare brand, presenting a dark spot removal cream, should be the same in positioning the model when showcasing the product. If the model in the “before” and “after” images turns their face differently, the real effect may not be obvious; thus, the power of a visual comparison may be lost. 

Keeping the subject in the same pose makes it look more relevant and the change more believable. Consistency of the before-and-after images can be guaranteed through the use of a tripod and constant lighting equipment. 

Professional product photographers usually work in a controlled studio environment in which the lighting is always the same, thereby ensuring that the same conditions are assigned to each image round. 

When it comes to capturing images submitted by customers, sellers should include clear instructions on how to take identical background images and angles to ensure authenticity.

Traditional Coffee is brewed using old-age methods that preserve its rich aroma and deep flavors. It varies across cultures, with popular styles including **Turkish coffee, Ethiopian coffee, South Indian filter coffee and Italian espresso.**Traditional coffee is deeply rooted in cultural rituals and social gatherings, making it more than just a drink. It’s an experience.



**Types of Traditional Coffee around the world**



1. **Turkish Coffee (Turkey & Middle East)**

Finely ground coffee is simmered (not boiled) in a cezve (small pot) with water and sugar, often served unfiltered with foam on top.



2. **Ethiopian Coffee (Bunna) - Ethiopia**

Traditionally brewed in a clay pot (jebena), often served with sugar, salt, or butter as part of a ceremonial preparation.



3. **South Indian Filter Coffee (Kaapi)**

Made using a metal filter, brewed coffee is mixed with frothy milk and sugar, creating a rich, aromatic beverage.



4. **Italian Espresso**

A small but strong coffee made by forcing hot water through finely - ground coffee beans. Forms the base for cappuccino, latte, and other variations.



**Conclusion**

Traditional Coffee is more than just a beverage; It is a reflection of history, culture and community. From the intricate Ethiopian coffee ceremony to the rich intensity of Italian espresso, every region has its own way of brewing and enjoying coffee, each carrying stories passed down through generations.

Embracing traditional coffee is not just about taste; It is about honoring the craft, rituals and connections it brings. So, the next time you sip on a cup of traditionally brewed coffee, take a moment to appreciate the journey it has traveled from bean to cup and the rich culture it represents.

K-pop agencies meticulously manage artists' personas, ensuring **consistent, positive branding**.

Netflix hits like *Squid Game* and *Crash Landing on You*:

2. **Control the narrative** through digital platforms
3. **Prevent crises** with strict image management

I noticed this last night when I was brushing my tongue before bed. It quite literally appeared in the past 24 hours, and I am not sure why.
I have been brushing my teeth 2x (sometimes
3-4) daily and scraping my tongue (every other day)

I follow a pretty standard diet but there was nothing similar to this colour that i've eaten to stain like that.

I do drink a lot of tea and moderate amount of coffee (only in the mornings) but i've been doing it for years and i've never had my tongue go brown/ black like this.

And yes I do smoke but again, many years and never had an issue like this.
I am more or less seeking some guidance on how to treat this? I have prepared a baking soda + salt water rinse today. I am very embarrassed with this condition and I can't see a doctor for atleast another week or longer because my insurance is taking a long time being set up.

Please give me some peace of mind because my mind is going to the worst case scenarios & I really need to focus on work! :(",1,1747125862.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

in my dream it was nighttime, i was getting prepared to go to sleep and set my lunch for work in front of the front door and i looked at the lock of the door and knew it was unlocked but didnt do anything. in my dream i literally go to sleep and wake up, which i’ve never had happen in a dream before. my cat (who is usually terrified of strangers) was laying on my desk chair all relaxed, i remember like taking extra attention to that in my dream like i knew smt was coming, i go to see my mom in the kitchen and see that our “lazy boy” couch chair thing is missing and so is the coffee table, i go snd see that my work lunch was EATEN right out my lunch box (??) and in my room that i slept in i see that all the hdmi cables from my bfs ps5 and my dvd player and everything are gone but not the tv or the things they were connected to. all my childhood stuffed animals were taken out of my closet too. my valuable jewelry given to me by my family was still there, so were all the appliances and electronics. basically just half of the living room furniture, my childhood stuff, my hdmi cables and my lunch was eaten (wtf tho) and i didnt see anyone or anything, i dont know what about it is making me so scared right now. i woke up genuinely crying and almost screaming “thank god it was a dream” i never felt so relieved to be dreaming.",4,1747125806.0,Dreams,5,1.0,False

I (26f) have been 7 years together with my fiance (32m), since 4/5 years his hygiene/selfcare has been not that great due to stress, according to him. I see with my own eyes that he does the basic things like brushing his teeth everyday, showering every day or every other day etc. But he doesn’t pluck his eyebrows unless I do it for him, he mostly smells like urine and coffee down there 🍆, like pretty strong 🥲 he smokes (i dislike the smell since im a non smoker), his oral hygiene is not the best, he almost never trimmed his beard/shaved or went regulary to a barber untill i told him. Stress, smoking and an unhealthy lifestyle made him look dull in his face as well. He almost never buys new clothes and wears the same things for years, that have been cropped in the dryer. There are some other factors that contributed to not making me feel that attracted to him anymore like sexual incompatibility (i had a higher libido and he often rejected me for 2 years) and also household issues like me cooking everyday, cleaning doing all the grocery shopping etc beside my fulltime job, just so he could work+ study in peace. There are probably more details that I missed, but I am typing this out of a place of depesration. He was not like this in the beginning of our relationship. He is actually a fairly good looking guy and in the beginning of the relationship he sometimes turned heads of other women. 

Fast forward, due to personal reasons I am taking antidepressants for a few months now. After 2/3 months into my med use I completely snapped out of this attraction/love feeling towards my fiance. One of the BIGGEST reasons is his selfcare, I often talked with him about this subject and he tried a few things like being extra clean down there, eating more fruits and drinking more water, lessening coffee. But still, the feeling is completely gone. I think that the med use contributed to it all. But i think after all the years, putting his needs before mine, helping him/giving him advice on his hygiene, lifestyle and selfcare, i am fucking drained. I barely have sex with him, even though the smell down there has improved a bit, i feel nothing. I feel a bit of physical lust yes, but the sexual desire is just completely gone. Am i overreacting? Am i being selfish for rather wanting to sleep with someone else that doesn’t neglect his hygiene/selfcare? 

Sorry for the rant, i maybe also needed to vent. Typed this out of a place of frustration sorry for the negativity.

She ended it with me, but we left on amicable terms, and she insisted she wanted to remain friends and “see what happens for us in the future”. We had a week or so of no contact before she broke the silence. Ever since we have some form of communication almost every day (she starts it 70% of days, me the other 30%, we probably have no communication at all at best one day a week). Some days it’s just sending a few reels and replies. Others were sending video snapchats or voice messages to sustain conversation. I had a mate over last week and his comment was “for two people who have just broken up, you sure are talking a lot”- this was on one of our more conversational days. 

My question is what did you do to get your ex back, and how long did it take? Who made the first move to actually date again? (And was it the person who did the breaking up?)
Do I just casually ask if she wants a coffee, or go for a wine at a local place? Aim for something more datey? I’m thinking I need to build up connection again with small things rather than just jumping into inviting her on a date? 

In the last 6 weeks, I’ve improved my diet, started exercising daily (I’m above average fitness anyway) and started seeing a counselor (anxiety and overthinking issues- kicked up as a result of the breakup).

Health/physique/fitness was never an issue in our relationship, but I always talked as a “gonna”…. Gonna start working out. Gonna start eating better. Gonna try gain weight. In hindsight, this is would have been a huge turnoff for a girl.

For those of you who don't know me I sold my business a few years ago and bought a farm and decided to live a life of meaningful work and the bare essentials. But along the way, I’ve learned something important about spending: **it’s not about cutting costs everywhere, it’s about spending freely on the things that truly bring you joy.**

For me, one of those things is coffee.

I could’ve stuck with a cheap drip machine or instant coffee, but instead, I invested in a setup that makes my mornings feel like a ritual. A good grinder, a precise pour-over kettle, freshly roasted beans, every step is slow, deliberate, and almost meditative, and I've designed this purposely. It’s not just about caffeine; it’s about starting my day with something that feels like a gift to myself.

And yeah, it wasn’t cheap. But here’s the thing: I don’t care about luxury cars, designer clothes, or fancy dinners. I’ll happily wear the same three shirts on rotation and cook simple meals at home. But the things I use *every single day*? The things that shape my daily happiness? I won’t cheap out on those.

Because simple living isn’t about deprivation, it’s about being intentional. Cutting the clutter so you can spend (time, money, energy) on what actually matters to *you*.",18,1747125452.0,simpleliving,1,0.8,False

(I’ve posted an exam analysis just before this one.)

So here’s how my overall experience went…

Last night, I couldn’t revise properly. My brain just stopped working. I genuinely couldn’t study anymore – it was like my mind had given up. That’s what really messed things up.

Also, since I’ve been studying late at night every day, my sleep schedule is totally ruined. I’ve been sleeping at 4 AM regularly. So obviously, I couldn’t sleep last night either. On top of that, I kept overthinking about my board results.

Woke up sleep-deprived at 6 AM. Had some coffee and breakfast, then left for my exam centre. It was around 13 km away – same city, but still quite far. I reached by 7:30 AM. Everything went really quickly; it barely took me 5 minutes to settle down at my seat.

Just a heads-up:

You only need one copy of your admit card.

The checking isn’t very strict.

Once you register inside, just head to your seat and that’s it.

You’ll need one passport-size photo later – that’s all.


So yeah, I was inside, seated with almost an hour left before the exam. Killed time somehow. I thought I was well-prepared and felt confident that I’d do fine.

But NOPE.

GAT was the first paper, and it straight-up murdered my confidence. Then Accountancy added more fuel to the fire. And finally, English just completely fried my brain. I don’t even know how to explain it.

At one point, I just wanted to finish the paper and run away. Maybe it was the lack of sleep, but I had a terrible headache. While attempting English, it felt like I was giving some random mock test – totally zoned out.

Finally, I got done with it and came home.

And guess what? CBSE results were out.

That just added to the chaos. Since my dad brought me home, he sat next to me while I was checking it.

I got 88.6%.

That’s decent, right?
But honestly, not good enough in my opinion.
I was aiming for 95%, and my papers felt like 90% types.
But yeah, I missed the 90% by just 7 marks. That stings.

Anyway, I can live with that.

But it’s the CUET mess-up that really hurts.

Firstly, I loved the movie and the series. Grew up watching the movie in the 90's and then SG-1 once we finally got NTL cable tv - happy days!

But something that's always bugged me from the movie, was at the start when Daniel goes to refill his coffee, the security guard asks him to show Id when he leaves the ""Authorized Personnel"" area, not when he enters, i.e. this scene:

https://preview.redd.it/vzoyq068ei0f1.png?width=1925&format=png&auto=webp&s=57eea6024cd299fc92e62344454fc41032cf9a8e

I get that it may well be ""to let the movie happen"", since:

1. He has to see the horoscopes on the back of guard's newspaper
2. Asking him to Id upon entry to the Authorized Personnel area after the revelation would have slowed down the entire scene

But the fact he had to Id on exit, rather than entry, has really bugged me - or is this based on reality, the need to Id on exit from such an area? I'm not US based, so genuine question.

I hated writing them. Still do. But the job market in 2025? It’s on some next-level sh\*t.

I was job hunting last month, totally burned out after sending like 30 “Dear Hiring Manager” PDFs that got ghosted. Then a friend (who actually got *replies* from recruiters) told me to make a **video resume** and hook it into a **digital portfolio**.

I rolled my eyes. I’m not a YouTuber. I don’t even like seeing myself on camera. But... I tried it.

# Here’s what changed everything:

📌 **I made a 1-minute video** where I just talked about:

* What I’m good at
* What I’ve done (quick examples)
* What kind of team I wanna join

No fancy script. Just me, a hoodie, and natural light from my window.  
Then I slapped it on the front page of a Notion site where I uploaded some of my actual work — designs, writing samples, little project breakdowns.  
Basically: **a low-effort portfolio that didn’t look like trash**.

# What happened?

People. Started. Replying.

I got two callbacks the same week. Both hiring managers said some version of:

>

The video wasn’t even amazing. It just made me feel *real* to them. Not just another wall of Times New Roman text.

# Then I started digging and yeah… this is a thing.

Turns out, I wasn’t imagining it. Here’s an actual article from Fast Company talking about how **video resumes and portfolios are becoming normal in 2025**:  
[https://www.fastcompany.com/91246197/job-search-2025-video-resumes-social-media-and-ai]()

The TL;DR of it:

* Recruiters are overloaded and scanning resumes in seconds
* Videos grab their attention
* Portfolios back up your words with actual proof

This isn’t just for designers or coders anymore — **anyone can benefit**. Even if you’re applying for admin jobs, marketing, HR, sales... it helps to show your face and speak like a human.

# Some things I learned (so you don’t mess it up):

🟢 **Keep it short** – 60 to 90 seconds MAX. Don’t overexplain your life story.

🟢 **Be casual but clear** – Think “coffee chat” energy, not TED Talk.

🟢 **Don’t overproduce it** – No one’s expecting Steven Spielberg. Just don’t film in your bathroom.

🟢 **Put your video where people see it** – Top of your portfolio, or right under your LinkedIn ""About Me"".

🟢 **Actually show work** – If you’re talking about a project, include a screenshot or PDF or something. Don’t just say “I’m detail-oriented.” Prove it.

# Tools I used (all free):

* 📹 **CapCut Desktop** – for editing my video (just trimmed the ends and added text)
* 🌐 **Notion** – made a clean one-page portfolio
* 🔗 **LinkedIn** – added my video to the Featured section
* 🖼️ **Canva** – used it for a simple header image + visuals

# Final thoughts from a tired millennial:

The job market sucks right now. But doing *something slightly different* helped me stand out more than sending another boring PDF into the void.

I’m not saying video resumes are for everyone. But if you’re stuck, frustrated, and getting ghosted, just try it once. Worst case? You cringe at yourself. Best case? You get hired.

And no — you don’t need to be hot, charismatic, or a content creator. You just need to sound like someone worth working with.

Today I turned 30, so I guess I can ask some questions! 😀

Anyway, I relocated 7 months ago and immediately on the beginning met few new friends at the gym (3 of them, all around 30 years as well).

They are really nice, but after some happenings, I am questioning my part in the group.

I am making 2x than them and have a car, so whenever, like really WHENEVER we would go out, we would go with my car, I would pick all of them, pay for the parking and also pay for the drinks (not every time, but when it was my turn, I would). 

I would’t spend too much for the gas and parking (like 15$), but it hurts me they never offered anything.

One of them recently bought a car, but we would still go with mine and repeat everything.

10 days ago I proposed to visit a small town nearby where we would go by a train and they were happy with the idea.

This weekend I saw pictures and videos that 2 of them posted - they left without me.

Yesterday I asked if they are for a coffee near me (I’m a bit out of the town, but it is still 5-10 mins with a car) and they said it would be nicer to visit some cool place outside the town with a nice sunset. I said I already went outside and won’t make it.

I am questioning myself and thinking are they using me and thinking I am
a bad person for it but I can’t shake it of my head that the facts are that I am always driving, paying for the gas, parking, they go without me or never want to come to my place…

I do make 2x, but they all are still working…

Why am I writing this? Because I have no one here and If I cut them all, I would be completely alone and never go out… ",1,1747124386.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I'm not adopted, but I do not know my biological father as my Mom had a one night stand. 

I will try to keep this brief; my Mom never brought the subject up with me, and would give short but (I think) truthful answers when and if I asked as a child, which wasn't often as shes not particularly approachable, but that's a different story. I think I was about 14 when I asked if she knew who he was, and she said it could be 'one of two guys... But I think X"".  About 15 I found this person on Facebook and messaged him, it took him a few months to see and respond and we met up for a coffee, I didn't tell my Mom I was going.  Unfortunately nothing much came of it, he told me he had not long gotten married and recently had what he thought was his first child, a little boy. Although I told my Mom where I had been when I got home, she was disinterested. Without the support from my Mom to follow up and I guess he was just starting his own family, it fizzled out to nothing. I was young and looking back I wish I had approached it differently.

Last year I decided to take an Ancestry test after listening to 'The Gift' podcast, which on the 1st day of this year I received my results... The guy I met is my biological father! But no other connections were made. I sent him a message on Ancestry, but he has not seen it or logged on for over a year. 

I still know his Facebook, he has a very open profile and posts a lot... It looks like he does a lot with his family and has a successful business, didn't have any more children but is still with his wife. Sometimes he posts things I don't politically/socially agree with (which is one thing holding me back... What if we're just very different people?) but what if the positives that could be gained can outweigh potential disagreements? Or by reconnecting could I be setting myself up for disappointment? This is what I'm scared of.

This morning, I wake up at 5am and this is all on my mind again. I check his profile for the first time in a while, he has posted about a girl with a different surname, 24, 'i love my daughter'. I click through to her profile and she is posting about her Mum, which is not his wife. He has another daughter, I have a half sister.  I knew I had a half brother that I've never met, but now this too.

The advice I am asking for... I think I would feel more comfortable reaching out to this girl first, maybe along the lines of ""Hi, I know we don't know one another but I recently took a DNA test, and through further research I think we are related. Are you free to talk?'.  If she's open to it, I'd like to find out if 1. She also only recently found out his is her dad and 2. How has her experience been since reuniting? 

I think this might be helpful to me, but is this selfish to put on her?

I feel like this has been something I have ruminanted on for decades now, but even more so since getting my ancestry results.  Any words of advice, whether relating to my question around his daughter or not are very much appreciated. Thank you in advance.",2,1747124323.0,Adoption,1,1.0,False

Come join the Sunday Miles Club (Brisbane)","Hey everyone I’m 25F! I’ve just launched a casual walking club here in Brisbane called Sunday Miles Club for girls in their twenties and I’d love to get more girls involved.

It’s super relaxed:
• We walk for 45–60 mins around new locations each fortnight(parks, rivers, city loops)
• All walking levels welcome
• It’s early-ish (8am) so we get the quiet city, then usually grab a coffee after
• No fitness pressure, just movement, convo, and good vibes

If you’ve been wanting to get outside more, meet new people, or start your Sundays feeling grounded this is your sign.

We share the location every week on Instagram: @SundayMilesClub

So yeah I'm 19F in a small Catholic College (I'm ukrainian), was homeschooled and I'm just trying to figure everything out now! I guess since starting college things have been pretty new and different for me and yeah, I'm still super nervous and introverted in general but yeah.

I've had massive baby fever since I was um fourteen ish but um yeah gosh.

I guess I'm trying to figure out or balance the idea of my traditional upbringing and well the idea of other stuff as well and I feel like an older Man would be able to help me out and would be the right fit. My faith is important to me but you can be from any background!

I guess for a long time now I've felt like that I've only been attracted to older Men and I'm not sure exaclty why and I've been sort of wrestling with it but yeah I think it's what I really need. I was raised in the church and it's still important to me and yeah I hope that's okay and we can work around stuff! I was raised with discipline

I have never really been able to be attracted to guys my age and if I crushed on someone it was always someone older and Iguess maybe being homeschooled had to do with it but I feel like maybe I guess now more than ever now that I'm in college that I can take a step and figure out what the right thing for me is. I have hangups and stuff but I want to learn and learn about an older Daddy too and what he would want from me.

I guess I'm trying to figure out or balance the idea of my traditional upbringing and well the idea of other stuff as well and I feel like an older Man would be able to help me out and would be the right fit. What's your fave sort of music? Go to breakfast or do you skip? How do you like your coffee? Could you be a good role model or guide and teacher and my rock for me?
