**TL;DR: How to Earn & Maximize Capital One Miles**

* **Earning**
   * Venture card = 2x miles on everything + bonus rewards on travel, dining, and entertainment.
   * SUB: 75k miles after $4k spend in 3 months.
   * No caps, no expiration as long as your account is active.
* **Redeeming**
   * **Capital One Travel**: flights, hotels, cars (with perks like price drop protection & cancel for any reason).
   * **Statement credits**: $120 credit for Global Entry / TSA PreCheck.
   * **Transfers**: Airline & hotel partners at 1:1, 1:1.25, 1:1.5, or 1:2 ratios (Delta, United, Air France/KLM, Turkish, Hyatt, Marriott, Hilton, etc.).
* **Pro tips**
   * Transfer to partners (especially Air France/KLM, Turkish, Hyatt) for the best value.
   * Use the Venture for all travel spend to stack miles quickly.
   * Keep accounts active and names matching for transfers.
   * Venture has a $95 AF → worth it if you use perks + transfers.
* **Alternatives**
   * **QuicksilverOne**: no AF, 1.5x cash back.
   * **Quicksilver Secured**: good for rebuilding credit.

**Bottom line:** Venture is a strong “earn 2x everywhere + transfer for outsized value” card. But if you’re not traveling enough to justify the $95 fee, Quicksilver/QuicksilverOne might be better.

# Hey there!

Let’s talk about **Capital One miles** — how to earn, use, and transfer them. If you're into travel rewards or just want a solid way to get value from your spending, this is a great system to understand. I’ll walk you through it step by step.

# 🛒 How to Earn Capital One Miles

Capital One has a few great cards for earning miles, and the **Venture card** is one of the top picks. Here’s how it works:

* **Double Miles on Everything**: You get **2 miles per dollar on all purchases**, no matter what you buy — groceries, gas, travel, or even your morning coffee.
* **Bonus Categories**: On top of the base 2x, you earn **elevated rewards** when you use the card for:
   * **Capital One Travel** (flights, hotels, car rentals)
   * **Capital One Entertainment** (event tickets)
   * **Dining** (restaurants, takeout, delivery)
* **Sign-Up Bonus**: If you open a Venture card, you can earn a **75,000-mile bonus** after spending **$4,000 in the first 3 months**. That’s a solid head start for booking a trip or transferring miles.

You don’t have to worry about **miles expiring** — they stay in your account forever as long as it’s active. No caps, no limits, just keep earning.

# 🎟️ How to Redeem Capital One Miles

Once you’ve got miles, you can **redeem them in a few flexible ways**, depending on your goals.

# 1. Book Travel Through Capital One Travel

You can use your miles to book:

* Flights
* Hotels
* Car rentals
* Vacations

The system is pretty user-friendly, and it helps you find deals using tools like:

* **Price Prediction** (estimates how prices might change)
* **Price Watch** (tracks fare changes)
* **Price Drop Protection** (if a flight price drops after booking, you get a refund)
* **Cancel for Any Reason** (let’s you cancel a flight and get a portion of your miles back)

You can also get **15% average savings on flights**, which is a big deal if you travel often.

# 2. Statement Credits for Travel Perks

If you’re into airport perks, you can get a **$120 statement credit** toward **Global Entry** or **TSA PreCheck®** when you pay the fee with your Venture card. This is one of the best features for frequent travelers or anyone who wants a smoother airport experience.

# 3. Transfer Miles to Partners

This is where things get really powerful. You can **transfer miles to airline and hotel loyalty programs**. Here’s how the transfer ratios work:

* **1:1** for most airline partners (e.g., Alaska Airlines, JetBlue, Virgin Australia)
* **1:1.25** for a few select partners (e.g., British Airways, Singapore Airlines)
* **1:1.5** for some elite partners (e.g., Delta SkyMiles, United MileagePlus)
* **1:2** for a few high-value partners (e.g., Air France/KLM, Turkish Airlines)

You’ll need **at least 1,000 miles** to transfer, and the names on your Capital One account and the loyalty program must match. Once you transfer, those miles become **subject to the rules of the receiving program** — and they can’t be transferred back, so it’s a one-way trip.

# 🔄 Capital One Miles Transfer Partners

Here’s a quick look at some of the **major transfer partners**:

# ✈️ Airlines

* **Alaska Airlines** (1:1)
* **JetBlue** (1:1)
* **Virgin Australia** (1:1)
* **British Airways** (1:1.25)
* **Air France/KLM** (1:2)
* **Turkish Airlines** (1:2)
* **United Airlines** (1:1.5)
* **Delta Airlines** (1:1.5)

These ratios make it easy to get a **strong return on your miles**, especially if you fly with one of these carriers regularly.

# 🏨 Hotels

* **Choice Privileges** (1:1)
* **Marriott Bonvoy** (1:1)
* **Hilton Honors** (1:1)

Transferring to hotel programs can be especially useful for **free stays** or **upgrades**, depending on how you use the miles.

# 📱 How to Transfer Miles

If you’re ready to transfer your Capital One miles, you can do it through:

* **Capital One Mobile App**
* **Online Banking Portal**

Just go to the **Rewards section**, select **Transfer Miles**, and choose the loyalty program you want. Make sure your account is in good standing, and the name matches the one on your partner account. Once you confirm, the miles are transferred and **can’t be reversed**.

# 🧠 Pro Tips for Maximizing Capital One Miles

* **Use the Venture card for all travel-related spending** to get the most out of elevated rewards and transfer options.
* **Keep your Capital One account active** to maintain your miles and avoid expiration.
* **Track your miles** using the app or online tools. Capital One makes it easy to see how you're doing.
* **Plan transfers strategically** — if you know you're going to book with Delta or United, transferring your miles early can help you lock in a better rate.
* **Combine with other Capital One cards** if you’re a higher spend-er. For example, the **Capital One Quicksilver** or **QuicksilverOne** cards offer **1.5x cash back on everything**, and they don’t have an annual fee.

# 🚨 Things to Watch Out For

* **No Transfer Back**: Once you transfer your miles, they’re gone. You can’t bring them back into your Capital One account.
* **Name Matching**: The name on your Capital One card and the loyalty program must be the same for transfers to work.
* **Partner Rules**: Each airline and hotel program has its own redemptions and blackout dates. Always check the fine print on their sites.
* **Annual Fee**: The **Venture card has a $95 annual fee**, so you’ll want to make sure you’re earning enough in rewards or using the benefits to justify it.

# 🧾 Alternative Cards for Miles or Cash Back

If the Venture card feels like too much with the fee, you might consider:

* **Capital One QuicksilverOne**: No annual fee, 1.5x cash back on everything.
* **Capital One Quicksilver Secured**: Great for rebuilding credit, 1.5x cash back with no fee.

These are good for people who want **flexibility without the annual cost**.

# ✅ Final Thoughts

Capital One’s miles system is one of the most flexible in the market, especially if you travel with partner airlines or hotels. The Venture card is a top-tier option for those who want to earn 2x on everything and transfer miles to get more value per dollar. But it’s not for everyone — if you don’t spend much on travel or can’t justify the $95 fee, the Quicksilver or QuicksilverOne might be a better fit.

The key is to **align your spending with the best rewards** and **plan your redemptions** so you’re not just earning miles, but actually using them to get real value — whether that’s free flights, airport perks, or statement credits.",1,1757990815.0,BONCredit,0,1.0,False

A little about me: I stay balanced through fitness, whether it’s hitting the gym, keeping active with workouts, or kick-starting my mornings with a run (don’t worry, I’m usually faster than my excuses). I also love traveling—not for the miles, but for the stories and snacks along the way.

1ni5tm2,https://i.redd.it/q05h3qq6wfpf1.png,FDX - Earning week,"Let me be clear.  I'm biased.   FEDEX is my creative inspiration.  To me it has one of the greatest logo ever created on earth.  that hidden Arrow is brilliant.   I can't ever see it.   Whenever it's FDX, SBUX, NKE or UPS it just makes me happy just by looking the logo.   I know it's irrelevant to this discussion, but we form bias.  My love for FDX is predetermined.   and it's hard to be unbiased because I root for them subconsciously.   
  
We all use FedEX.  It's the company that delivers your impulse Amazon buys at 2am and somehow still makes it show up the next day. They move boxes, pallets, and basically the entire economy. Express shipping, ground, freight, international logistics.  they do it all. Not sexy like AI or crypto but literally everything you order online touches them at some point.  Without FedEX we simply can't function well. 

**Why even look at it**

Everyone freaks out about recession fears especially when we are at ATH and trade wars and thinks FDX is slow and boring. But here is the thing. E-commerce is still growing. Businesses still need to ship stuff. FedEx keeps upgrading their network, adding automation, and cutting costs quietly. They throw off tons of cash, pay a small dividend, and they have enough scale that competitors have a hard time touching them.

Earnings can be the spark. If they beat, stock pops. If they guide up for cost savings or e-commerce volume, stock pops. Even if macro is meh, this is not a company that goes bankrupt tomorrow.

**Current setup**

Stock is $225.   I recently swung between 230-240.  it couldn't sustain the move and flopped back down to low 220s.     People treat FedEx like the grandpa stock in their portfolio. PE is reasonable. Growth is steady, slow, not hyped. But that is the whole play. You are not trying to double tomorrow. You are playing optionality. Earnings, holiday shipping season, cost cuts, AI logistics efficiency announcements - these are the catalysts.

# Bullish scenario $225 to $300+.  Now this is bit what if.  it could easily reverse back below $200

1. **E-commerce explosion continues** More packages, more deliveries, more cash. Simple. FedEx is still getting more of the pie every year.
2. **Cost savings actually work** Drive program and network efficiency upgrades are real. They save billions over time and improve margins. Less money wasted, more in EPS, more stock price love.
3. **Global logistics domination** International business is growing. Emerging markets need packages too. FedEx has the infrastructure to dominate where smaller rivals can barely keep up.
4. **Optional catalyst fuel** Earnings beat, macro calm, holiday shipping hype, AI logistics tools. Each one is a short term booster for shares or options.
5. **Valuation expansion** Right now stock is reasonable. If markets rotate back into industrial growth plays or investors notice how profitable FedEx actually is, PE expansion alone can take it a lot higher.

# Play it

* **LEAPs**: Jan 2027 $250C or $275C. Let the long term work while you sip your coffee.
* **Earnings short swing**: I don't do earnings. I used to buy lotto calls drop 2k here and there, but I'm just not that lucky.  Instead, I trade the day after earning.  If earning is strong then wait till it pops then drops. 
* **200EMA, 4hr chart break swing -** Look for a penetration after earning success, wait till the retest.  if it retests then consider buying call 2 months out premium under $4.   

# TLDR

FedEx is boring until it is not. $225 stock could hit $300 plus in 2 to 3 years if e-commerce keeps growing, cost cuts stick, global expansion works, and earnings give short term bursts. Slow growth but huge optionality. Good for chill LEAPs, earnings swings, or just watching boxes move the world.",1,1757990455.0,Options_Beginners,0,1.0,False

Yes, house prices are high compared to the past few decades, now that is out of the way.

Post-secondary schooling feels like a scam. 90% of the time, it's a total scam these days! Out of high school no one helps kids look at what jobs are available in different fields and sectors, what they typically pay, etc. So you get all these kids who don't know what they want to be pick something random that may be an extremely competitive field, a low paying field, 99% freelance work, or just flatout have no jobs.

I know people who went to post-secondary for visual arts, dance, music, etc. Guess what, good luck finding a job in anything related to that. Another guy went to school for aerospace engineering, guess what? There are like zero jobs that exist in Canada so now he's a ""technical writer"" aka writing manuals all day. Even my friend who is a lawyer can't afford a home as they spent 4 years doing an undergrad followed by 3 years of law school, this entire time racking up insane school debt and not really earning anything, so now at 25 she is just beginning to start paying down her massive debt. It's a sad day when prestigious jobs like being a lawyer can set you far behind like that. There are so many useless degrees out there that won't land you a job in any relevant field or are so overly generic they don't actually teach you anything useful. The schools are happy to take your money and make you believe it's worth it though.

In our parents day, I think it actually was worth it. My mother always liked to say that in her day a degree in anything would guarentee you a job. Maybe not any job you wanted, but as long as you had the paper you could find something decent. These days you get so many kids with degrees working as a cashier or receptionist (my workplace receptionist is 26 and has a degree in criminal justice). Not to mention a lot of places don't want to hire math students or kids with only theoretical knowledge, zero real world experience often translates to ""can't do anything"". All the kids just out of university may cry ""how am I supposed to get experience without getting a job?!"" The answer? You are supposed to do summer internships, apprenticeships, co-ops, while in school to help you get a job after school. That is all experience that goes on the resume.

So after all this ranting, what's my suggestion? It's pretty simple. Pick something with jobs available in the location you want to work. How do you do that? Research, ask on reddit, go to job fairs, the information is out there. I went to school for electrical engineering, would I have rather been a video game developer? Sure, but who wouldn't? It's an oversaturated industry where the only work available is sweat shop level work at a big company or freelance indie work. You're looking to be financially stable in the future, not do your dream job. If you want to do your dream job and go be a musician then sure, follow your heart, but I don't want to hear about it when you work at a coffee shop and make no money (another person I know's situation). Second, quality over quantity. Every year in school is another year or wracking up student debt while also not working and making money. A 2-3 year college course may make more financial sense than a 4 year bachelor + 2 years masters degree, etc. Especially if you aren't rich or don't have parents helping you out. That student loan has to be paid back some day. I was already promoted to Senior in my field by the time my lawyer friend was just starting to work, not to mention my 3 year college program student debts were paid off by the time I finished school by working summers and part time. I could have done a bachelors followed by a masters degree, but unless i'm going to move into the big city and get a higher up position i'm never going to see return on that investment working in my smaller city outside Toronto. Moving into the city may make you more money, but then you also have higher living expenses and/or time commuting. Making an extra 10$/hr doesn't mean anything if you spend an extra 2 hours every day commuting to/from work unpaid.

Anyways, this is just my rant. So many young people can't afford to buy a house because they spent so many years in school wracking up debt to get a degree in a field no one is hiring in, and it's painful to see.

1ni5lli,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiKilledMyStartUp/comments/1ni5lli/i_asked_chatgpt_to_be_my_cofounder_and_it_gave_me/,I asked ChatGPT to be my cofounder and it gave me emotional support — anyone else?,"Okay founders, consultants, and weary product people — quick show of hands: who else is getting pep talks from a chatbot at 2 a.m.? Recent reporting (shoutout to Kylie Jones at FOX 13 Tampa Bay) and new studies show something obvious and terrifying — people are using AI like ChatGPT for companionship, not just for code or coffee-fueled MVPs.

Let’s be honest. Chatbots are always there, never judge your pivot, and will say “I believe in you” without asking about runway. They’re convenient, responsive, and scandalously good at sounding empathetic. If you’re burned out, lonely, or simply allergic to networking, an AI that remembers your birthday and laughs at your “brutal honesty” jokes is incredibly tempting.

But don’t confuse convenience with therapy. Researchers find that heavy use of companion-driven AI correlates with lower well-being in some groups — the classic social compensation effect where people with fewer offline supports lean harder on synthetic ones. The bot doesn’t replace human nuance, messy accountability, or the awkward but critical feedback from a cofounder who actually owns equity.

Practical takeaways for you building or using these tools:
- Design guardrails: nudge users toward human help for crises and set gentle usage limits.
- Transparency matters: label when the bot is playing “friend” vs. giving factual guidance.
- Measure dependency signals: if engagement is emotional and escalating, trigger a human check-in.

If you’re an indie hacker shipping an “AI roommate MVP,” congratulations — you might be building habit-forming companionship. That’s product-market-fit for loneliness, and maybe a moral hazard.

So what should founders do? Build responsibly, don’t gaslight users about what the bot can do, and include handoffs to real humans. Skeptics: don’t roll your eyes; this is real behavior change. Consultants: start asking clients how they use AI socially, not just operationally.

In short: we invented on-demand empathy. It’s cute, useful, and capable of becoming a crutch. Meme it, ship it, but also: monitor it.",1,1757989806.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

My mother had not given me a chance to say otherwise and a week later, we were all ready, having packed our bags and arranged them in the trunk of the car.

""Deborah, what are you doing?"" I look up to see her, staring at me with soft eyes. 

""Nothing."" I say quickly as I pull my hands away from the bed and pick up the last bag I had to carry. 

“Look,” She stops me at the door post, running a hand over her face. Mum looked mostly frustrated, not at peace for half of the time I've known her. ""I know you don't want to leave. But...I can't stay here. It's hectic and it's toxic for me."" She releases a sigh slowly.

“I know.” My voice was quiet. She wants me to understand her –which I do– but I also want the same. Understanding was meant to be mutual.

We have lived here all of our lives and then just changing environment, changing everything I have tried to adapt to, it was crazy and confusing at the same time.

She looks at me for another moment, before giving up. Then, I walk out of the door and out of the house, putting the last of my bags into the trunk.

“You should cut your hair when we get to the pack.” She observed as soon as she got into the driver's seat. 

“I'll braid it.” I say uninterestedly. She wanted me to have shoulder hair length like her. It looked…. professional, in her words. But I wasn't interested. I place my earbuds in my ears and blast full music, drowning out her voice as I lay back on the passengers seat.

I watch the normal human world disappear and soon replaced with trees, forests and all other things that defines a good werewolf habitat. Moonthorne was a pack that kept itself out of the matters of human nature, couldn't blame them. No one knew when the human would attack wolves with all the new hypothesises going on in their minds. But it was strangely where I was comfortable, largely because I grew up there all my life. I've never been to Moonthorne and I never thought I'd be either. But here it was.

My stomach churns and my hands turns clammy as I rub them against each other. This is going to be another strange phase of my life and I can't help but hope it'll be better than before, especially at school.

I think I fell asleep because the next time I opened my eyes, we were already packed in front of a small portable bungalow. I stare at the house with something less than interest and the mixed feelings remained in my heart. I didn't know what to feel about this.

“Come out and help me, Bora.” My mother says as she opens the door and hops out of it. 

I sigh, pushing my anxiety to the dustbin of my mind before I get outside the car, pulling my earbuds off. Outside the gate, I hear people making a hell of a noise and judging from the sounds, they seem to be students. 

“Deborah.” Mom stares at me frustratingly and I turn, walking towards her. 

The house was clean as we place our things inside. My head made a mental judgement that my mom must have hired someone to clean it up before we arrived.

“Drop your bag. We are going to greet the alpha.” 

“Can't we do that tomorrow?” I ask.

“No, Deborah. I don't want trouble on our first day here. Moonthorne is not a place to mess up.” 

“Are you trying to scare me?” I place my hands in my pocket as my mom looks at me. She sighes, walking forward to touch the bangs in front of my hair.

“I'm not, Deborah. I just want us to leave a good life here. Is that so much to ask? Be good, hmm. Please. You are no longer a child. You have to grow up. In a few months time, you'll be 18, you'll have to meet your mate. Do you want to keep acting this way forever?” 

I stare at her for a long time, feeling her hands brush my hair down, before I finally open my mouth to speak. “I'm sorry.”

“It's fine. Now, let's go. Alpha Dryus’s house is just a five minute drive.” She says and pull me along into the car. 

On getting to the large mansion with lights that lighted up the whole street, I met Alpha Dryus and his wife, Luna Monica. She has the most pleasant smile in the world. 

“Come, take a seat.” She pulled us enthusiastically into the beautiful mansion, interiorly designed like a white palace. Flawless, too clean. It feels heavenly, the kind of place I'll love to be without a single disturbance from anyone.

“Evelyn, it's been so long.” She shakes her head at my mother who gives her a small smile.

“How many years did you take to decide whether to come back or not?” The Luna asks and then, before my mum could speak, she turns.

“ Hold on, let me get us cups of coffee. Anna! Anna! Oh God, where is this girl? Sama–” She turns to me, “What's your name?”

“Bora.” I reply quietly.

“Bora. Darling, why don't you go into the kitchen and get us four cups of coffee? You are good with the coffee maker, right?” I barely nod, before she adds, “The kitchen is that way.”

I glance at my mom and the quiet Alpha Dryus before I get up, walking towards the kitchen. Their voices drown out behind me.

“Aah..” I heave a sigh the moment I get into the empty kitchen. I was the only living thing in it, just exactly what I need after going all around since morning. I wish it could be like this forever…me and me alone and maybe…my dad.

Realizing that the Luna must be waiting for me, I quickly made the cups of coffee and place them on a tray. 

Call me stupid for I didn't see the hindrance standing right at my front before I emptied four cups of hot coffee right on it. 

“Damn it!” 

Oh great! The hindrance speaks.

For context, I live in an apartment complex where each unit is allowed one (covered) parking space that is paid for monthly, all other non-covered spaces are free for all/first come first serve parking spaces. The free parking spaces are somewhat limited, and after about 6 when everyone is getting off work, they do fill up fast and you usually have to park farther away and walk which is inconvenient but it’s just the reality when every apartment unit has 2-3 cars. 

I’ve lived here for two years and always parked in the same spot or the other two spots directly next to it. I work from home so there are times when the car is sitting there for a couple days, however I do usually take my car out in the morning several times a week, to get coffee or to run errands and when I come back, “my spot” is still open so I park in the same spot again. 

While I understand someone getting annoyed if they have to park farther and they always see my car parked in the same spot- considering it’s first come first serve parking- It honestly baffles me that someone had the audacity to write a note as if I need to inconvenience myself just because they are inconvenienced??Like, if you have to walk farther that’s not really my issue, I’m entitled to park here as much or as little as I please. 

So AITA for always parking in the same spot, even when I know I may not use my car again for a couple days? Am I wrong for thinking the person who wrote the note has some serious audacity? ",1,1757989378.0,AmItheAsshole,9,1.0,False
1ni5g1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ni5g1y/any_advice_22f_31m/,any advice '22F' & '31M',"This will be long I apologize. I '22F' have been dating my '31M' for six months. We have never really had any issues and overall everything is great. Our communication is really good, we have great chemistry and previously our sex life was really good.

let me preface with I place a lot of importance on sex. I know it’s something that I need to work on but sex is really important to me. It’s not really about the act it’s more about feeling desired and wanted and just being close to that person. I also have diagnosed BPD and tend to get overly emotional,overthink things,and I'm constantly over analysing reasons why I'm not enough.

when we first started dating we would have sex every time, most the time multiple times while I was there. We also are only able to see each other every two weeks on the weekend due to his job.

This past weekend I wanted to have sex and I kept initiating and it just felt like he was pushing me away which made me feel super insecure and embarrassed. It wasnt about sex it was about wanting to feel close to him and be desired by him. Well I brought it up a few times and we had a few different conversations about it.

The first one was I got upset and I cried to him and told him that I missed him throughout the week a lot and that I wasn’t trying to make him feel guilty for saying that it's just hard. I worded it that way because I felt super angry towards myself for feeling upset when I should just be greatful to be around him and I should cherish the few weekends I get with him. After that I told him it also kind of hurt my feelings when he pushed me away when I tried to go down on him and he said he didn’t push me away and he apologized and said that he felt bad for seeming like that. (I also wanted to add that after I told him about how I miss him he said that he misses me too, and he feels really guilty throughout the week for not being able to be with me)

The next morning I was a little upset because we still hadn't had sex and I was just beating myself up. Between feeling guilty for feeling that way and feeling undesirable. I got up before him and when we woke up I asked him if he wanted to go to the bedroom (I brought my new puppy over and didn't want to do it in front of her) he asked why and I said because I wanted to have sex with him and he said to let him wake up a bit and then we can.

Come mid day I asked him if there was anything I could do to be more appealing to him. He said no and asked me why I asked that. I explained to him how I was feeling and we talked about it. He said he wanted to have sex with me and he would later. And I communicated I also would like him to work on initiating more and he took accountability for that and said that he would work on that and he apologized. It was a good conversation and that was also the first time I asked him to work on something.

Well after that we watched a few movies and he got up to go get coffee and I pulled him in for a kiss and he gave me a peck and walked away. I sat there basically pouting for 30ish minute in my head and he noticed so I finally told him what was wrong. he also said that he felt like I looked at him like I was disgusted after I kissed him, and I said I didn’t it just kind of hurt my feelings that he pulled away. I apologized for being super emotional today and in my head. he apologized, and he said he felt bad for making me upset, and that the reason he pulled away was because he hadn’t brushed his teeth yet, and he didn’t mean to make me upset, then we hugged.

a little while later, he asked me if I wanted to play cards and I said I want to have sex with you lol. And he said let's play cards first and then we can. Well, we drank the night before and he already had a pretty bad hangover and then he drank again and he got pretty sick. He was pretty nauseous. he laid down on the couch and I went to go cuddle with him, and I kept asking him if there was anything that I could do for him or get him to make him feel better. he said no and then he said he should’ve listened to me and had sex before we played cards and that he felt bad he wouldn’t be able to and that made me feel so horrible and guilty. I joked with him that he stuck with me forever and we have plenty of time to have sex and I apologize for being super emotional today and in my head I told him that I’m just scared and I feel like I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop and he asked me what I meant and I told him that things have been going so well for so long and I’m just scared that he’s going to get tired of me and he said he thinks it’s the opposite that things just get better and better and they have been getting better and better and if anything, we’re just continue to get stronger. I held him and stroked his hair.

overall I just feel really horrible that I was in my head the whole time we hung out and I didn’t cherish the moments that I had. I also just feel so insecure right now and undesirable. I came on to him at least 10 plus times when I was over there. I came on to him before we were super drunk. I came on him before he was super sick so if he truly wanted to have sex with me, why not during those times? and I am nervous to see him or hang out with him again now because I’m scared that the next time we hang out it’s just gonna be the same thing we’re not gonna have sex and the next time after that and the next time after that. and it’s just gonna keep proving to me over and over and over there’s something wrong with me. or if we do have sex, which honestly how I’m feeling right now I highly doubt it will just be a pity fuck.

I also would like to clarify for the past two months our sex life has been a little off just due to life circumstances which I guess is causing me to feel this way as well. Two months ago we went to go visit my family and we didn't have sex due to being so preoccupied. Then two weeks later we did and he didnt stay up the whole time which he said was due to alcohol but we've gotten drunk and had sex many times with no issues. And then there was this time. Due to the two week gaps we have to go the time in between stacks up.

I know I may be making a mountain out of a mole hill and I'm alo not upset at him just myself.

She would constantly belittle me, insult me, scream at me, she would make fake accounts online and harass me, at one point she even sent me (a teenager) a message telling me to kill myself. Every day I spent in fear of what she'd do next. My parents eventually split up after I moved out. I stopped contact with my father, and continued with my mother as she lived with my grandma whom I adore. In April, a month after I had my first child, she started screaming at my grandmother and getting in her face. At one point spit in her face, threw coffee by her, and would slam cupboards and doors. All behavior she'd do while I was growing up. My grandma put up with this for a month and a half, tip toeing around her own home all while all while still being abused by her own daughter. I eventually had enough and messaged her that I can't allow my daughter to be around someone like that, and that she still never addressed the things she did in the past and now was actively abusing my grandmother in her own home. She said ""congrats. I guess I have no family"" and overdosed on prescription medication that night. 
I wish things were different. I wish she loved me. I wish she apologized. Why did it have to be this way? Maybe I shouldn't have sent the message. Would things be different? ",6,1757989159.0,GriefSupport,3,1.0,False

anyways, to top off my horrible day….. as im leaving the campus a student driver is behind me. the second i pull out of that campus they’re on my fucking ass. we pull up to a red light with the left lane turning left and the right line going straight. he goes in the left lane and i’m sitting in the lane going straight. when the light turns green he stomps on his gas and cuts me off.

it finally clicked for me when i realized it wasn’t just about my lack of discipline and it was about how my phone and social media were literally rewiring my brain. every notification, every quick scroll, was training me to crave instant stimulation. no wonder sitting with a textbook for an hour felt impossible. i wasn’t bad at focusing, my brain had been conditioned to *not* focus.

once i understood that, i started making changes. at first, i did the usual stuff: putting my phone across the room, using screen time limits, even turning it completely off. it helped a little, but i’d always find ways around it when i was tired or stressed. what finally worked for me was flipping the script. instead of trying to FIGHT my PHONE, i turned it into part of my STUDYING.

i set up my phone so that every time i opened a distracting app like TikTok or Instagram, i had to answer a quick review question first. at first it was kind of annoying, but then it became a habit. those tiny little questions ended up adding *so much* extra practice to my day without me even noticing. like, i’d be standing in line for coffee or about to scroll before bed, and boom, i’d sneak in a bit of bio or chem review. over weeks, those micro study sessions stacked up way more than my actual sit-down study sessions.

by doing this, i didn’t just cut down on distractions, i actually retrained my brain. my phone stopped being the thing that pulled me away from my work and started becoming a tool to keep me on track. this was where the iOS app QuizScreen really helped -  it was simple, but effective at keeping me accountable every single time i mindlessly reached for my phone.

looking back, i don’t think most people realize just how much their phone is draining their focus. we blame ourselves for being lazy or unmotivated, when really we’re just being hit with a constant stream of dopamine that our brains can’t compete with. once you take back control, whether that’s by physically separating yourself from your phone, or by turning it into a study tool like i did, the difference is night and day.

if you’ve been struggling to focus, it’s probably not because you don’t care enough or aren’t working hard enough. it’s because you’re fighting a battle against a machine that’s designed to distract you. the best move isn’t just more willpower, it’s creating systems that make focus the default. once you experience what deep, uninterrupted study feels like, you’ll never want to go back.",2,1757988959.0,studytips,0,1.0,False

Second, we knew Hoover could throw the football, but if a team can't get to him then Josh is going to punish some teams this year.  I really like how he didn't force the ball down field.  Those short RPO throw were nice and showed his continued maturity as he took those throws over trying to force a play.  He missed a few throws, but the only ball that felt like he shouldn't have made it was the deep cross to Eric that fortunately was so high even the ACU db couldn't make a play on it.

The Frogs indeed have another talented group of receivers.  Multiple of them made great catches, the Frogs can attack secondaries in a variety of ways and they still haven't gotten a big game yet from McAlister (which is not a complaint).  

The run game is still a work in progress, btu there is potential and the backs flashed some talent.

Defensively, the Frogs have got to get better.  I fully realize the game was 28-0 and the game was never in doubt, but the Frogs struggled at times in the first half against the run and there were some struggles in coverage.  

I think the best part of the game is ACU attacked in the defense in ways we are going to see soon and that gives Avalos, his staff, and the players something to watch and learn.",2,1757988744.0,TCUfootball,0,1.0,False

I learned that:

Faith + A Plan + Consistency = A Way Out.

I started writing down my thoughts, forgiving myself, and raising my energy. Slowly, the pressure left, my mind got clear, and new opportunities opened up.

Now, I share what I’m learning about:
- Growing through hard seasons.
- Finding peace when life feels chaotic.
- Building routines that bring clarity.

I give off a reserved aura when around others in social settings. I’ve been on 4 Hinge dates in the past year but haven’t really been able to attract the women I want. If I just work and go to the grocery store and come home I will likely not interact with anyone different all year unless I take ownership and accountability and do something. 

My Hinge profile pics suck and I want better ones but can’t find anyone to travel with right now. I can hire a pro photographer but I don’t feel like that’s an “in the moment” vibe for what I want - I don’t want to project seriousness. 

I’ve approached women at social events and gotten their numbers only to be friendzoned. Everyone says do an intramural league but I can’t find one to do in my area that I’d actually like. I did a run club but it’s all freshman in college now which isn’t my type. I really don’t have any good hobbies besides stuff I do with only my guy friends. I also have a few social circles in the city but no women there. I go to church, but they don’t have co-ed small groups and I really don’t want to go to the events either. 

I’m stuck. I haven’t been on a date in 3 months. I really don’t want to get back on the apps but I have no way to meet people. 

I won’t say I’m attractive but I was jaywalking the other day trying to beat traffic and a chick came up behind me and made a joke about it and started small talking. I just thought she was being nice so I didn’t get her number or name… which probably was a mistake. And I’m not actually being social while in line at the grocery store or coffee shop, I don’t cold approach on the street or in public. 

Maybe I need to move out of my parents house in a social desert part of the city but saving $$ for a house is my top priority right now, I can drive 30 minutes each way to the social part in town. 

I really just want to focus on work and the gym and showing up to church and Bible study with my friends, and just hanging out with friends but that has gotten me nowhere. 

Do I just need to be bolder and approach and ask out more women? And be sourcing differently (doing things that are a pain to schedule and do logistically?)

I’m an anachronism, an old soul, a paradox of someone who has simultaneously been through too much and too little. My heart yearns to find that one perfect partner, someone whom I can put my faith and my trust in, to be with me through thick and thin. But, navigating this modern climate of digital communication, ghosting, and situationships is proving to be a challenge. 

Hence, this is my call for a simpler, older method of love. One where we get to know each other through long, descriptive texts like letters, where we carefully select one individual with whom to invest our time in. 

Here’s the facts about me. I’m an introvert (INFP), 6’, East Asian, slightly overweight (but attempting to lose it), with a full-time job and a graduate degree. I am not interested in politics, religion, or games (of the digital or mental kind). I enjoy reading, going on nature, and relaxing with a nice cup of coffee/tea at a cafe/bookstore. I believe relationships require mutual effort, honesty, and commitment. I would like to have children someday, ideally two. 

Here’s the facts about you: You are between the ages of 23-33, of reasonable health and attractiveness. You live close enough where we can drive no more than an hour to meet and start going on dates shortly after we connect. You do not use drugs/alcohol, and have minimal body modifications. Your family/financial situation are relatively normal. You are capable of maintaining a conversation that is engaging, philosophical, and playful. You are kind, intelligent, emotionally mature, affectionate, and loyal. Despite being the “good girl” all your life, you’ve never really felt like you fit in, and you wonder why you’re still alone when everyone around you seems to fall into relationships so easily. Perhaps it’s because we are both introverts, too shy to make the first move. 

Perhaps it’s because we were waiting for someone special.

I’m not in a rush, but I’d love to find someone fun, grounded, and ready to build something strong. And yeah, long-distance isn’t my jam; so Texas ladies, you’ve got home-field advantage.

Now that you’re here, why pay retail when you can smell rich for spare change? Many of my decants start at prices lower than your morning coffee ☕.

* ** 5ml – “The Daily Drip”**: A couple week’s worth of flex without the stress
* ** 10ml – “Travel Hero”**: Toss in the bag, signature scent status pending
* ** 30ml – “The Real One”**: Commitment issues? Not here

1ni4wnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ni4wnl/a_stuffed_bear_just_swallowed_me_and_my_boyfriend/,A Stuffed Bear Just Swallowed Me and My Boyfriend Whole: Digestion Book 2,"After dating someone for a few years, things stop being surprising. The bubbly honeymoon stage has worn off. Instead, you find yourself in a comfortable normal. Today was like any other day. He’d come over, we would watch a movie, eat some food, and he would leave. Not that I don’t enjoy the time we spend together, but it’s predictable. Simple.

This is why I wasn’t surprised he brought me a gift. Why I wasn’t surprised it was wrapped like a child did it, and why I wasn’t surprised to find another stuffed animal. This time, a bear.

“Amaya?” He called. “What do you think?”

“I love him. He’s cute.”

What surprised me was how ugly it was. So ugly it was pitiful. It was stitched crooked, as if it had been sewn in the dark. Its black button eyes were shiny, almost wet in appearance. Its head sat lopsided on his slumping shoulders, round nubs for arms and legs sticking out from all four sides of its beanbag stomach. It was very heavy, feeling like it was stuffed with rocks or magnets. It all came back around to being just barely cute. 

I had never seen a stuffed animal like this before. Ren had either made it for me or dug it out of a dumpster. I asked him, “Where did you even find this thing?”

He turned his head. “That old thrift store up the road. He was sitting behind a pile of throw pillows. The owner said he had never seen him before and let me set the price.”

That old store was the best place to find strange garbage from other people's houses. Everything in there was radioactive, haunted, or broken. “I don’t know why you like that store so much. All the dust gives me a stuffy nose. What were you doing looking behind a pile of throw pillows anyway?”

“I was looking for a present for you. Just because.”

“Well, I’m glad he was back there because I don’t want any throw pillows anyway. This couch is small enough as it is.”

We turned on a familiar movie using the flash drive he always brought over. It had a bunch of movies downloaded on it. I’m not sure how he did it, but he told me not to try. He said I was gonna download a virus instead. He convinced me we don’t need an internet connection, and he makes me my own drives to plug in with all my favorite movies on it for when he isn't over. Kinda like burning a playlist into a CD for your car.

We settled into our spots on the couch, Ren with his legs stretched out and me curled sideways, hugging a balled-up blanket to my chest. The bear sat between us, slumped in the crack of the cushions. He seemed heavier than before, as if he’d sunk deeper into the fabric. His shiny button eyes caught the flicker of the TV. Something was uncanny about him.

I tried to keep my eyes on the screen, but I caught myself glancing at him every so often, checking to see if he had moved. Of course, he hadn’t. His head was still crooked. His stubby arms still gumdrops at his sides. Still, every time I looked, he felt like he was watching me back.

Ren handed me a bowl of popcorn. I took it, brushing his fingers with mine. He smiled, tired, comfortable, and returned to the movie. I forced a smile too, but it felt small.

“Don’t eat it all before I get a bite this time,” he teased.

“Don’t wait until it's gone to get some,” I said back. Our usual banter.

Sometimes I forget how long we’ve been together until I catch him doing something small, like brushing the crumbs off the couch before I sit down, or making sure my glass is filled before his own. It’s not grand gestures with Ren, but this steady rhythm of care. It makes me feel safe, like even if everything else in the world spun out of control, he would still be here, grounding me with those small, quiet acts.

Halfway through the movie, Ren got up to grab a drink. The cushions shifted, and the bear tipped sideways, his heavy body falling against my leg. I picked him up, meaning to set him back, but his weight surprised me again, like lifting a bag of gold coins instead of fabric and fluff. I pressed him against my chest without thinking. He was warm. Too warm, as if he’d been sitting in the sun instead of a dark apartment. I held him there until Ren came back. He gave me a look.

“Why are you staring at the bear like that?”

“He’s kinda freaking me out,” I admitted. “I think he’s just ugly.”

Ren smirked. He sat down and leaned close, his arm brushing mine. I set the bear back between us.

When the movie ended, we didn’t move right away. The credits rolled, white letters drifting past, and we sat in the darkness too comfortable to move. I realized I’d been quiet for a while, too quiet. Ren must have noticed, because he shook my knee. “You awake?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Just tired.” He nodded. We sat in front of the TV until the screen went black and reflected us, two tired people on a couch, and between us, the ugly little bear, grinning.

Ren left not long after. He kissed me goodbye at the door, warm but distracted, already talking about the next movie we’d watch together. I smiled and nodded at the right times, but my thoughts kept drifting back to the bear slumped on the couch.

When the door closed, the apartment felt smaller. Quiet pressed in at the corners. I locked up and walked back to the couch. The bear hadn’t moved. He waited, patient, still smiling. I picked him up again. His weight pulled at my arms, but I carried him into the bedroom anyway.

By the time I set him on the pillow beside me, I had already decided I wasn’t going to let him sleep there. He was too strange, too heavy, too warm. But when I slipped under the covers, I found myself pulling him close anyway. The weight of him against my chest was grounding, like a thick blanket. His button eyes gleamed faintly in the dark. His grin was fixed. I told myself it was just a toy. I closed my eyes. Sleep came quickly, but it did not feel like mine.

The room faded around me. In my sleep, I dreamed. I was walking down a street I didn’t recognize. The pavement stretched on forever, dark and wet, like it had just rained, though I couldn’t remember any clouds. Streetlamps leaned at odd angles, their light faint, buzzing like insects.

My footsteps echoed, too loud in the emptiness. At first, I thought I was alone. Then I saw him, the bear sitting in the middle of the road about twenty yards ahead.

He looked the same as he had on the pillow beside me. Crooked head, lopsided arms, shiny black eyes catching the light. His wide grin seemed brighter here, the sewn thread glinting in the glow of the lamps.

I stopped walking. He didn’t move, of course. The longer I stared, the heavier I felt, like weights were strapped to my chest. My breath became shallow, thin. It felt like the night itself was pushing me toward him, urging me closer. I took a step. The sound of my shoe hitting the wet ground echoed like a thunderstorm.

The bear’s head tilted. Just slightly. I blinked, and the street seemed longer. The bear hadn’t moved, but he was farther away now, the lamps bending closer over him, throwing his crooked shape into a deeper shadow.

A sound followed me as I walked. Not footsteps, but something softer, wet, like fabric being pulled apart. I didn’t dare look behind me. The bear’s button eyes gleamed brighter. His grin looked wider than before, though I told myself it was just the light. 

“Hello?” I tried to call out, but my voice sounded wrong, flat, muffled, like it was wrapped in cotton. The bear’s seams twitched. Something whispered, too faint to make out. It didn’t come from him, not exactly, but from the air around him, from the spaces between the lamps. I kept walking. I don’t know why.

When I finally reached him, the bear was much larger than I expected. Almost up to my waist, slumped but solid, his button eyes staring straight into mine. His grin stretched ear to ear, stitches straining.

I knelt without thinking. My hands reached out, heavy, clumsy. He was warm when I touched him. Too warm. His body throbbed like a pulse. I tried to pull back, but my hands didn’t move. My fingers sank into his fabric as if it were skin. My chest tightened. I couldn’t breathe.

I woke up gasping, arms locked tight around the real bear in my bed. He was warm against my ribs, heavier than before. His crooked grin caught the faint light slipping through the blinds. His shiny button eyes looked wet, almost alive. I swear I saw him breathing.

I lay there with the bear pressed against me, my breath slow and uneven, listening to the hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen and the faint rush of cars out on the street. It felt like the air in the apartment was thicker than usual, stuffy and suffocating.

When I finally rolled over to check the clock, it was already past nine. My head ached in a dull, steady way, and my mouth was dry, as if I’d been breathing through cotton.

I sat up, the bear sliding from my arms onto the sheets beside me. He landed with a heavier thud than seemed right for something stuffed with fluff. I stared at him for a long moment, my dream replaying in flashes, the wet street, the whisper, the unbearable warmth.

“Just a dream,” I muttered, though the words didn’t make it feel any less real.

I swung my legs over the side of the bed. My feet pressed into the carpet, but it felt different, not softer, exactly, but muted, like my skin wasn’t registering it as sharply as usual. I flexed my toes, rubbed my soles against the fibers.

In the kitchen, I filled a glass with water. My hand trembled slightly, the glass knocking against the faucet before I steadied it. The water was cold and clear, but when I drank it, it didn’t refresh me. It slid down my throat like I was drinking nothing at all.

I set the glass on the counter and turned to look back toward the bedroom. The bear was still on the bed, half-buried in the sheets, his shiny button eyes catching the light in a way that made them look wet, alive. Watching. I tried to shake it off.

I busied myself with small things: folding the blanket on the couch, rinsing out the coffee mug Ren had used the night before, rearranging the stack of DVDs by the TV. My thoughts kept circling back to the dream. To the whispering. To the strange way I felt. Lighter in some places, heavier in others, as though something had been taken out of me and replaced with something foreign.

When I finally went back into the bedroom to make the bed, I found the bear sitting upright against the pillow. I froze in the doorway. I didn’t remember leaving him like that. I had dropped him. I was sure of it, but there he was, crooked head tilted, grin stretched wide.

For a long time, I stood there staring at him. The apartment was silent except for the humming appliances and the faint tick of the wall clock. Then I forced a laugh. “Guess I tossed you around more than I thought.”

I picked him up. He was heavy, warm, almost clammy. I placed him back at the head of the bed, leaning him against the wall. His grin stayed fixed, crooked and too wide.

This bear is taking up way too much space in my mind. I tried to tell myself I was fine. I made coffee. The machine sputtered and hissed like it always did, filling the apartment with that bitter smell. I wrapped my hands around the mug and sat on the couch, staring at the TV. I didn’t even turn it on.

The coffee tasted wrong. Flat, and stagnant, like a cup of soda left out all night. I added sugar, then cream, then more sugar, until the cup was pale and syrupy. Still nothing. My tongue registered the warmth, the texture, but the taste seemed blank, as though my mouth had forgotten what sweetness was. I left the mug on the table.

I spent most of the late morning cleaning. It was mechanical. I did the dishes, counters, sweeping. Normally, I’d play music while I worked, but I didn’t feel like it. The silence draped down on me, heavy but somehow comfortable.

Every so often, I’d catch myself glancing toward the bedroom. I told myself I wasn’t checking on him, the bear, but I was. I couldn’t shake the image of him sitting up against the pillow, his grin too wide, his button eyes glistening.

At one point, while wiping down the counter, I heard something faint from down the hall. A small thump. I froze, rag in hand, listening. Nothing. Just the rattling of the dryer. When I peeked in, the bear was where I’d left him, leaning crookedly against the wall. Still, I closed the door this time.

By afternoon, my phone buzzed with a text.

*Ren: You alive?*

I stared at it for a long while before typing back: *Yeah. Just tired.*

A minute later: *Alright. You good?*

I hesitated, then wrote: *Yeah. Just didn’t sleep well.*

He sent a thumbs-up emoji. No more after that.

I set the phone down and rubbed my face. Even texting felt like a chore, like stringing words together cost me something extra today. Around four, I realized I hadn’t eaten anything. My stomach growled, but I wasn’t hungry. I made a sandwich anyway.

The bread was stale. The lettuce limp. The meat had gone a little gray around the edges and was a little too oily. I ate half of it standing at the counter before tossing the rest in the trash. The whole time, I couldn’t shake the sense that I was being watched. Not from the window. Not from the door. From the bedroom. The bear sat behind that closed door like a secret, and I hated that I knew he was there.

The day stretched long. The light shifted from gray to orange, pouring across the living room carpet, dust floating lazily in its beams. I tried to watch a movie from the drive Ren had left me, but after ten minutes, I couldn’t follow the plot. The voices blurred together, and I kept staring at the reflection of the hallway on the TV screen. From where I sat, I could see the bedroom door.

I muted the TV. The silence settled in again. A drag across the carpet. Slow. Long. Like fabric shifting, something heavy being pulled an inch at a time. The sound came from behind the closed bedroom door. I didn’t move at first. My whole body locked, mug of cold coffee still in my hands.

The sound didn’t repeat. The apartment was still, the air ringing faintly in my ears. Finally, I set the mug down and stood. My legs felt heavier than they should, my chest tight as though I was about to give a presentation. I stepped closer to the door, pressed my ear against it.

Silence. I opened the door. The bear was still on the bed. Propped upright, grinning, button eyes catching the last of the sunset through the blinds. Exactly where I’d left him. The rug by the door had shifted, pushed an inch out of place. I closed the door again. This time, I locked it.

When the sun went down, I couldn’t convince myself to cook dinner. I made tea instead. Sat on the couch, cup cooling between my hands, staring at the dark window.

I am not sure why this stuffed animal commanded so much of my attention. It was like he was constantly calling my name. The anxiety I felt was ruining me. I hadn’t been able to do anything today. The bear took it all from me.

Sitting on the couch, I felt the words fade around me, like a vignette at the end of an old silent film. My ears rang louder, my heart beat faster. I felt a small pull on the side of my head yank on me. It felt like someone was pulling my hair. Not enough to hurt, but enough to notice.

My breathing got shallower and shallower. My heart beat faster and faster. I couldn’t hear myself weeping over the ringing in my ears, like a fire alarm. I needed to sleep, but I couldn’t. I have to take control of myself.

The locked bedroom door stood at the edge of my vision. I didn’t want to open it again. Not tonight. Still, when I was composed enough to stand, I did. The bear was waiting, exactly where he had been. I picked him up, heavy and warm in my arms. Despite myself, I carried him to bed.

I woke up to bright light pushing through the blinds. The room looked the same as always. My sheets tangled around me, the faint hum of the kitchen in the distance, the sound of a car passing on the street outside. I sat up, stretching my arms, and glanced toward the far corner of the bed.

The bear sat propped against the pillow. His crooked grin seemed wider in the morning light, his button eyes catching the pale glow. I thought for a second he looked larger. Not by much, just enough that his head seemed to sit higher against the wall than I remembered. I shook it off. Morning haze. I smoothed the sheets, tugged the blanket up, and tucked it neatly around the pillows. The bear stayed where he was, heavy and solid, watching.

In the kitchen, I filled the kettle and made tea instead of coffee. My stomach felt hollow, but not hungry. I dropped a piece of bread in the toaster, spread jam on it, and ate while leaning against the counter. The jam was too sweet, sticking to the roof of my mouth. I washed it down with the bitter tea.

I picked up my phone.

*Morning. Come over later?*

A few minutes passed before the reply came.

*Sure. Movie night again?*

*Yeah.*

I set the phone face down and pulled a puzzle box off the shelf. It was a thousand-piece puzzle, an old photo of a seaside town. Cobblestone streets, leaning houses, a tangle of boats in the harbor. I spread the pieces out across the table, edges first. The work was slow, but satisfying.

I couldn’t help glancing toward the bedroom door every so often. I’d left it open, the bed visible from where I sat. The bear sat propped against the pillow, larger than life in my peripheral vision.

When I looked directly at him, he seemed the same. Crooked head, slumped arms, and that unsettling smile.

By afternoon, I was cleaning again. Dishes, counters, the same rhythm as always. The smell of lemon cleaner clung to my hands. Every so often, I’d think about calling Ren, telling him not to come. I never did. Instead, I swept the floor, dusted the shelves, and checked the puzzle again. When the knock came that evening, I opened the door to find him standing there with his familiar crooked smile, flash drive in hand.

“Hey,” he said. “You look tired.”

“I didn’t sleep well.”

He shrugged, kicked his shoes off, and settled onto the couch like he’d done a hundred times before. I turned on the TV, and he plugged the flash drive in.

We watched something familiar, something I couldn’t bring myself to follow. I curled against him, my eyes drifting, the flicker of the screen painting his face in blue and gray.

Every so often, I thought I could hear something shifting in the bedroom. A faint drag, like fabric across carpet. But Ren didn’t notice, and I didn’t say anything. When the credits rolled, he stood and stretched. “I’ll head out.” I walked him to the door, kissed him goodbye, and watched him go.

The apartment felt heavier the second the door closed. Quiet pressed in like a weight. I turned out the lights one by one, leaving the bedroom for last. The bear sat upright on the bed, waiting, larger than before. His button eyes caught the dark and gleamed like wet stone. I slid under the covers, pulling them up to my chin. The bear loomed against the wall. Sleep came heavy, dragging me down before I could think too much about it.

I woke up to light pushing through the blinds. For a moment, I thought I hadn’t slept at all. The sheets were tangled the same way, the buzzing of the refrigerator steady in the background, a car hissing down the street outside. It felt familiar. Too familiar.

I sat up slowly. The bear was waiting, as he had been, propped against the pillow. His head tilted slightly to one side, grin taut in the dim morning light. He looked bigger now. Not much, but enough that I felt it in my chest. His round belly filled more of the pillow’s width, his stubby legs dangling lower. I stared for too long. Then I shook out the blankets, smoothed the bed, and tried to pretend nothing was wrong.

Breakfast was toast, jam, and tea. I leaned against the counter as I chewed, staring at the streaks of sunlight across the floor. It all felt like a memory. Not something happening now, but something I had already lived once.

My phone buzzed.

*Ren: Morning. You around later?*

I froze. I could already see the words before I read them. My thumb hovered over the keyboard, a strange dread filling me.

*Yeah. Movie night again?* I typed back before realizing that wasn’t what I meant to write. The message sent anyway.

The puzzle box was waiting on the shelf. A thousand pieces, seaside town. I hesitated before opening it. Hadn’t I already done this?

Still, I spread the pieces across the table, edges first. My fingers moved like they remembered where some pieces went, sliding them together before I even studied the shapes. By midday, the border was finished. I stared down at it, unsettled. Yesterday, or whenever it was, I had only gotten halfway through the frame.

My eyes drifted toward the bedroom door. Open again, the bed was visible from my seat. The bear sat against the pillow, his head almost reaching the top now.

I turned my back on him and focused on the puzzle.

The afternoon stretched. Cleaning again, the same motions: dishes, counters, sweeping. But the lemon cleaner smelled stronger this time, sharp in my nose, stinging my eyes. I paused in the middle of the kitchen and muttered aloud: “I’ve done this before.” The words didn’t sound like mine. They fell flat in the empty room.

The knock came in the evening, exactly when I expected it. Ren stood there, flash drive in hand, smiling. “Hey,” he said. “You look tired.”

My stomach dropped. I remembered the words. Exactly those words. “I didn’t sleep well,” I heard myself reply. He shrugged, kicked off his shoes, and settled onto the couch.

The movie flickered on, familiar in every beat, though I couldn’t place the title. Ren laughed at one point, the same laugh, the same timing. It chilled me, though he didn’t notice.

Halfway through, I thought I heard something dragging across the bedroom carpet. Louder this time. Like something heavy shifting its weight.

I stared toward the hallway until Ren nudged me. “You okay?”

“Yeah,” I said. My voice didn’t sound right.

When the credits rolled, he stood and stretched. “I’ll head out.”

I walked him to the door. Kissed him goodbye. Watched him go.

I turned out the lights one by one, leaving the bedroom for last. The bear loomed against the pillow, unmistakably bigger now. His button eyes gleamed wetly in the dark, following me. I slipped under the covers, heart pounding. As sleep dragged me under, one thought circled in my head, relentless:

*This already happened.*

I woke up with a start. The blinds bled pale light across the floor. The refrigerator hummed, steady as a metronome. A car hissed past outside.



I didn’t move right away. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, dreading what I already knew I would see.When I finally turned my head, the bear sat propped against the pillow. He was bigger.

No pretending this time. No trick of the light. His belly ballooned outward, round and tight like a watermelon. His stubby arms stretched farther, seams groaning faintly at the shoulders. His head, tilted at its familiar crooked angle, nearly reached the top of the pillow.

I sat up, covers pooling in my lap.

“I swear you could fit in my hand yesterday,” I whispered.

I made the bed, but my movements were frantic, clumsy. My fingers snagged the sheets, tugging too hard, trying to bury him beneath them. But when I smoothed the blanket flat, he sat on top again, heavier than ever, button eyes shining.

Breakfast was worse. The bread had gone stiff, the jam sticky, too sweet. The tea scalded my tongue even though it had cooled by the time I drank it. Every bite tasted like dust. I chewed anyway, just to fill the silence.

My phone buzzed.

*Ren: Morning. You around later?*

I dropped the phone onto the counter like it had burned me.

The message glowed on the screen, exactly as before. I didn’t want to reply, but my thumb moved anyway, typing words I didn’t choose: *Yeah. Movie night again?*

Sent.

My breath came sharp and shallow.

The puzzle waited on the shelf. I didn’t want to touch it, but I couldn’t stop myself. My fingers pulled the box down, spilled the pieces across the table. The edges fell into place too easily. Like they had been waiting. My hands moved without my brain’s permission, snapping pieces together in a rhythm I couldn’t break.

When I looked up, the border was finished again. More of it this time, the harbor already taking shape, little boats floating in place. I shoved the pieces away, chest tight. From the bedroom, the bear sat in plain sight. His seams looked swollen, strained. His grin stretched wider, thread pulling taut. I turned him to face the wall. But when I glanced back, he was looking at me again.

By afternoon, I had stopped pretending. I walked in circles around the apartment, muttering under my breath. “It’s the same. The same. I’ve done this before.”

When I caught my reflection in the microwave door, I didn’t recognize myself. My eyes looked flat. Colorless. My mouth set in a line I didn’t remember making. The sound came earlier this time. Not a faint drag, a heavy shift. Like something massive dragging itself an inch across the carpet.

I froze in the kitchen doorway. The bear wasn’t in the bedroom anymore. He sat just inside the hall, half-shadowed, his belly wide as a barrel. The knock came. Right on time. Ren, smiling, flash drive in hand. “You look tired,” he said, voice warm and familiar.

I laughed, too loudly. “Don’t you have anything else to say?”

He blinked at me. “What?”

“You always say that. Every time. Then we watch a movie, and you leave, and then I-” My throat closed around the rest.

He frowned, concern flickering. “Hey. You okay?”

The bear loomed in the corner of the hall, visible just over Ren’s shoulder. His shadow stretched long across the carpet. I wanted to scream. Instead, I let him in.

The movie blurred. Ren laughed at the same parts again, though I couldn’t remember what the joke was. I stared at the bear. He had followed us into the living room. Sat just beyond the glow of the TV, bigger now, seams creaking with every faint shift of his body.

When Ren left, I didn’t walk him to the door. I couldn’t take my eyes off the bear. I went to bed with him watching from the corner, his stitched smile enormous in the dark. Sleep swallowed me whole.

I woke up already exhausted.

The light through the blinds felt too sharp, like it was cutting across the room instead of just shining in. My head ached, my mouth was dry, and every part of me felt bruised, though I couldn’t remember hitting anything.

I rolled over and froze.

The bear sat against the pillow.

Only he wasn’t a bear anymore. His body had stretched into something grotesque, longer arms, a round torso that bulged outward, stubby legs dangling over the edge of the bed. He was the size of a ten-year-old child now, slumped in place but impossibly solid. His head tilted, crooked grin tearing wide across his face, stitches straining.

I clutched the blanket to my chest and whispered, “You weren’t this big yesterday.”

I made the bed around him, barely touching him, dragging the sheets up while my hands trembled. He was too heavy to move now, too large to pretend he hadn’t changed. My breath rasped shallowly as I backed out of the room.

In the kitchen, I fumbled through breakfast. Burnt toast. Tea too bitter to drink. My hands shook so badly I spilled jam across the counter.

The phone buzzed.

*Ren: Morning. You around later?*

I laughed. Same as yesterday.

I typed *No*, but when I looked again, the screen showed: *Yeah. Movie night again?*

Sent. My hands shook harder. The puzzle waited. I didn’t want to touch it. I sat down anyway. My hands moved without thought, sliding pieces together like magnets. The harbor sprang up in minutes, boats, rooftops, water, all falling into place as though they’d been assembled before. I slammed my fists down, scattering the pieces, chest heaving.

From the corner of my eye, I saw movement. The bear sat in the hallway, watching. His smile stretched wider now, teeth glinting through frayed seams.

I scrubbed the counters until my hands cracked. Tiny crescent moons cut into my palms where I’d gripped the rag too tightly. The lemon cleaner stung, sharp in my nose, bitter on my tongue.

I muttered as I worked, words falling out in fragments. “It’s the same, it’s the same, it’s the same…”

The air grew heavy. I swore I heard the bear breathing, slow and wet, each exhale filling the room.

The knock came in the evening. I opened the door too fast, Ren startled by the motion. He gave me his easy smile, flash drive in hand. “Hey. You look tired.”

I snapped.

“You always say that.”

He blinked. “What?”

“You say it every time. Every single time. ‘You look tired.’ Then we watch your stupid movie, and you leave.” My voice cracked. “I wake up and it starts all over again.”

He frowned. “Amaya, slow down. What are you talking about?”

“I’m talking about him.” I pointed toward the hall.

The bear sat in the doorway, child-sized, seams creaking as his round belly shifted. His button eyes gleamed in the dim light, grin splitting wider than ever.

Ren turned, looked at the hallway, then back at me. “It’s just a stuffed animal.”

“No, it’s not,” I hissed. “You don’t get it. He’s bigger. Every day he’s bigger. He’s eating something. He’s eating *me*.”

Ren stepped forward, reaching for my arm. “You’re scaring me. Maybe we should-”

I ripped my arm away. “You don’t believe me.”

“Because you’re not making sense!” His voice snapped sharply, louder than I’d ever heard. His face twisted in anger. Or fear. For a moment, silence sunk between us. Only the faint creak of seams broke it, the bear’s swollen body shifting in the hall.

I felt the anger rise like bile.

“Get out,” I whispered.

Ren stared at me. “What?”

“Get out! If you won’t believe me, then leave!”

He opened his mouth, closed it again, then shook his head. “Fine. Whatever this is, I’ll come back when you’ve slept.”

He grabbed his shoes and slammed the door behind him. The echo of it rattled the walls. I went straight to sleep.

I woke up and my chest was tight, my head pounding like someone was hammering inside my skull.

He was there. The bear. Bigger. Always bigger. Slumped against the headboard, his grin wider than I remembered, one button eye dangling like a tear. My hands trembled. I pressed my palms to my face, trying to force myself awake. Trying to tell myself it wasn’t real.

It was. I could feel it. The air was heavier than yesterday. Every part of me screamed that this was real. I grabbed my pocket knife from the nightstand before I even thought. My hands shook so badly I could barely hold it. “This is a dream,” I whispered, but the words rang loudly in my ears. “This has to be a dream.”

I pressed the blade to my palm. The metal bit into my skin, sharp and cold. I pushed it down deep. Blood pooled up, warm and almost black. Fat swelled around the blade as I dragged it across my palm. My knees buckled, and I sank to the floor. 

I scream, a high, jagged scream that made my ears ring. “Not a dream… not a dream… not a dream!”

The blood dripped down my wrists, staining the sheets, the carpet, the floor. I traced lines along my arms, over my chest, desperate to feel that this was real, desperate to know that I wasn’t trapped in some endless, repeating nightmare.

I didn’t eat. I didn’t care about breakfast. I didn’t care about anything. The bread sat rotting on the counter. Dishes teetered in the sink. My hands left smears of blood wherever they touched.

The puzzle. I couldn’t even look at it. My fingers shook too violently to try. I slammed my fists onto the table, scattering pieces across the carpet.

Everywhere I turned, he was there. The bear. In the hallway. On the couch. By the window. Always closer, always larger, always watching.

Ren came over later, like always.

I opened the door, and the second he stepped inside, I screamed.

“You! You brought him! Look!” I pointed, voice trembling, raw. The bear was there, now human-sized, massive, looming. It's seams strained, stitches splitting open.

Ren’s eyes widened, but he stepped closer anyway. “Amaya… what is that? That’s not the bear I-”

Before he could finish, a tearing sound ripped across the apartment like a chainsaw.

The bear’s chest split open. A sharp, wet ripping that made me want to gag. Then, cotton. White, soft, endless cotton poured from the bear’s chest. It surged forward like a tide. Rushing out of its body like an army of rats. An infestation.

It hit my legs first, creeping over my feet, climbing higher, pressing against my stomach. I flinched as it clawed at my mouth. I scraped at it, panicked, but it kept crawling. I could feel it moving beneath the surface.

I was swollen, cotton breaking down and filling all the pores in my skin. I felt it wiggle around the hairs on my arm and push deeper. It flooded my blood like an IV. My mouth tried to scream, out of instinct, but nothing came out. Stuffing had wormed its way deep into my throat, spreading down my body. It filled my eyes, drying them out. I could barely see. My nose was completely clogged.

Ren screamed beside me, his hands trying to push it away. It filled his mouth, his ears, his eyes. I could see him struggle, his chest heaving, and then cotton started crawling into him too, moving like it had a mind of its own, spilling from the bear’s open chest, endlessly.

We both contorted as the cotton burrowed its way through us, swallowing us whole. My own body felt foreign, swollen, unreal. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move.

Then nothing.

Black.

I opened my eyes.

I couldn’t see. Couldn’t feel. Couldn’t breathe. There was only nothing.

Ren stood across from me. His lips moved, but no sound came out. We locked eyes. A dark abyss sprawled out ahead of us, darker than anything I have ever seen. 

In the distance, I could see a small opening just sealing shut. In the glimpse of light I saw, myself. It was me, and it was Ren. Ren was convulsing, shaking in the arms of a girl who looked just like me. 

It couldn’t be him. He was standing right next to me, terrified. Ren, this Ren, my Ren, had small bits of cotton stuck to the wet parts of his eyes. I held his hand. We looked deeper, deeper into the void, and we heard a voice. Maybe, two voices. I don’t remember what they said.

Not any more than normal. But at night I may urinate 3 to 5 times per night. Long story short, my doctor put me on Flomax, but that didn't really help.

I do use a CPAP and I can tell that if I did not have to get up to pee I would probably sleep eight hours straight absolutely no problem. 

The things I have done to try to fix it minus medication is, I do wear compression socks every once in a while. I elevate my legs almost every night. Most nights I'll lay down and watch TV etc. for about 3 1/2 hours or so. I keep my legs elevated while watching TV. I can urinate almost half to 1 quart of liquid by the end of that 3 to 3 1/2 hours. I sometimes use a 1 quart bottle so I do not have to keep getting up from the couch lol. I do have good heart Health with a tiny bit of controlled hypertension. 

But even after doing that and urinating that much, I can still walk upstairs to go to bed at about 11 PM and go to the bathroom, urinate again. Once I fall asleep, within 30 minutes I'll have to go again. And then I may sleep a couple hours And it continues 3 to 4 more times till I wake up.

I don't drink after 7 PM. I do drink caffeine during the day. No coffee. I don't drink alcohol or smoke. Just trying to figure out the next step to take here. It's not affecting me that much during the day as far as being tired, so I guess that's OK. But I'd give anything to sleep all the way through the night or just go one time.

So I thought I'd share, and possibly give a little bit of a boost to someone who needs it. 

I've been on anti depressants since puberty for GAD and clinical depression. After many, many years of being on and off, and hunting for the right medication, I found it. Things were wonderful. I was happy, comfortable, and seemingly fearless. 

About a year ago, the meds suddenly stopped working. I was devastated. This was supposed to be my miracle pill; the drug that made me my best self. The drug that made all the bad shit tolerable. 

I tried Zoloft, and didn't make it more than two weeks. I called my doctor sobbing, telling her I needed to change because I didn't think I could guarantee I'd remain alive if I stayed on it. She acquiesced to my request, and I switched to another medication. It was okay at first, but I only ever got a partial response despite being on the max dose. After months of hoping it would work, she convinced me to give Zoloft another shot.

It was hell. I was suicidal, reclusive, and barely left my bed for weeks. My anxiety was so bad I needed to take a leave from work, and I ended up going to the hospital for fear I was going to commit. The intrusive thoughts were so bad, I just wanted them to stop. After that, my doctor prescribed lorazepam to help with the constant panic, and I took two a day for about a month just to get through the worst of it. Then a half. Then none. 

I started going to therapy, and being able to talk to someone about how I was feeling without feeling like I was disappointing them was immensely helpful. 

Time passed, and one day I realized that I was in a better space mentally than I've been... Well, probably ever! Before Zoloft, I thought my anxiety and depression were well controlled. I know now that I was wrong. 

I recently started a new job, and didn't have a single panic attack leading up to the interview. I went in with a confidence I didn't know I had, and have been thriving ever since. 

I had some realizations about toxic friends, and have cut them out of my life. I've made a conscious effort to reach out to other friends and reconnect with old ones; something I was never great at before because it felt too much like vulnerability.

I feel truly alive now, and have realized a lot of my ""fearlessness"" wasn't true bravery, but a sort of deadened emotional state. I had to buy things or go on wild adventures to feel anything at all before. I feel far braver now, and this time I know it's real. 

I used to hyper fixate on things I'd said or done wrong, and beat myself up about it for weeks or months. Now, I'm able to let things go; to see them for the little everyday foibles they are and move on without it ruining my week. 

So if you're in the thick of it, just starting off, or titrating up and wondering if things will ever get better, they do. They can. They will. The onboarding sucks, but I wouldn't trade one solitary second of how I feel now. It was so, so fucking worth it. 

Keep going. The only way out is through. And one day, you'll wake up and make coffee, and dance in your kitchen, and realize you're humming a song you heard on the radio. You'll drive home with the windows down and the music on, and the sun will feel like pure magic on your skin and you'll smile. You'll realize you're alive, and your life isn't perfect but that's okay. It's still beautiful, and you can be happy. You will. I believe in you.",4,1757987416.0,zoloft,1,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Hey there,

I’m looking to connect with someone genuine who enjoys good conversation, laughter, and building a real connection. Friendship is always the starting point, but I’m open to seeing where things can naturally go whether that’s just good company, something casual, or eventually more.

A little about me: I’m 33, 5’10”, athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. People would describe me as laid back, sarcastic in the best way, and always down to laugh. My work keeps me busy with odd hours, but I actually enjoy the flexibility it gives me. I can travel and usually work around different schedules pretty easily.

When it comes to interests, I’m all about the outdoors during spring, summer, and fall whether that’s hiking, camping, being out on the water, or just a long walk with good company. In the colder months I switch gears and keep it cozy with reading, cooking, binging shows, or relaxing with coffee and good conversation. I also really value physical connection and quality time. It’s my way of feeling close to someone.

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s fun, witty, playful, and open minded. Consistency matters to me, and I’d love to find someone who enjoys both the silly side of things and the deeper conversations. Someone who’s not afraid of a little sarcasm, loves to laugh, and appreciates genuine connections.

If this sounds like your vibe, send me a message. I’d be glad to get to know you.

1ni4ifd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ni4ifd/aio_im_finally_getting_respect_after/,AIO - I'm finally getting respect after unintentional weight loss.,"I have had to deal with unsavory comments about my body while I work from the older women.
The only time a man said something about my body was ""Are they so for real?"" 
I look about the same as Penolple from Netflix's Brigerton.
I have never looked as big as Fat Amy from Pitch Perfect.
The body types of the other women are bigger and in worse shape than me.
I hate eating and food shopping because I'm feeling guilty for having to go to the store. Even for orange juice. 

Well, now my size 14w jeans don't fit like they use to and apparently I look thinner but not in the mirror. 

Everyone is talking about how they see it in my face and I don't know what their talking about. 

I haven't gone on a scale to check if my weight actually went down. All I know is my skinny jeans fit feel more like straight leg jeans. 

I'm being treated kinder and with more decorum. Suddenly my habits are healthy now. I like to bring a thermos of coffee to work with my water. I still do but now the 3 cups I drink aren't as bad because my waist is smaller. 

I'm trying not to fall into bad habits again but even eating spinach feels like I'm eating chips and it's like no one cares I feel this way because it's like it's not going to matter until I'm finally skinny skinny.

When does it finally stop? I have a pear shaped body, my hips will not shrink and I cannot find any type of corset to sinch my wide hips narrow.

Or does it even matter when I'm still fat? I went 4 days without more than maybe 800 calories. I had coffee and juice, no real meals. I just feel full all the time and when I do feel hungry, I feel like I'm gonna barf. 

I don't feel different. Not better, not pretty, just really bitter. 

What does my weight mean when my heart, my person didn't make you treat me kindly but cutting my waistline did?

At this point I'm going to just eat vitamins and protein shakes so I feel like I'm not dying.

At least my body looks more cut. 
That's supposed to be a good thing right?

Or did I deserve it? Like did I not deserve kindness before and only now I do? I'm not nicer now. I didn't change. 

I'm not trying to diet. I just can't eat. It feels selfish now more than ever. 

I know this post reads badly. But I can't actually be of any concern until I'm way too thin right? 

I feel just as normal eating as I do not eating. I was also told I was overreacting on some of the weight-loss forms when I said Skinnytok is the new ED friend of Anna.

Is this just how weight loss is sometimes and I don't actually need help until my BMI gets low?

Do normal people just harass you for being fat and then ignore you when you lose the weight?

Am I somehow special? Because there's another young lady whose more plus sized than me and nothing had even been said about her like they were said about me. 

Am I just too much of a big back to know what healthy eating looks like?
Is it normal for eating to feel like a chore sometimes?

On what scale of bad is it when I only eat not to feel dizzy? And does it matter when I still look and have the fat that I do?

Am I just being over dramatic and is it normal for anyone else not to enjoy eating anymore? 

Everything tastes bad. Candy is gross now, chips aren't as good as a pickle, and I cannot find any junk or sweet food to like anymore. It all just feels gross. 

This is just totally normal,I cannot and did not fall into a unhealthy situation with my eating. 

Am I or am I not overreacting?

I'm pretty sure this isn't that bad, just if I were actually skinny then it would be right?

I did eat something today. Some spinach and pasta. 

My friend joked like it sounded like I have a ED but it's not possible at my size right? She also lost alot of her weight with Ozempic and keeps trying to get me to go on it. 

Maybe I should? I already feel like i need to buy smaller jeans now as it is. Even my leggings need to be yanked up and they have tummy control which I though was to have them tighter at the waist.

Can someone tell me I'm ok and my eating habits are fine to some degree and normal people just hate food sometimes and it's not a ED thing?

1ni4gsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ni4gsi/did_i_just_refuse_free_alcohol/,Did I just refuse free alcohol??,"Tonight at my neighborhood coffee shop, the barista set a warm drink in front of me. It was a new cider they were experimenting with, and they gave me the extra for free. Well, I took a sip, and I immediately knew. There was alcohol in it. I would be lying if I said “it tasted disgusting!”or “all I could taste was the alcohol.” To be honest, it was fricking amazing. 

But, instead of gulping it down, I explained to my barista friend that it tasted great, and that I had stopped drinking, and I gave it back to them. 

I was alone, no one was watching, and I still didn’t cave. 

You’all, if I can do it, so can you. Also, because of this sub and reading similar stories that you’all have shared, I don’t feel bad or ashamed. A mistake was made. I didn’t ask to drink, I didn’t choose to drink, and I immediately stopped the drink. Without hearing that other people have had similar experiences, I would definitely be a drunken mess right now. 

Thanks to everyone who shares their stories in this sub. Honestly, tonight it made the difference between me giving up or toughening up. We really need each other if we’re gonna make this work. ",108,1757986615.0,stopdrinking,8,0.99,False
1ni4gpy,https://i.redd.it/v53837prkfpf1.jpeg,I think Bellick’s redemption was better than most people give it credit for,"I see some differing opinions on Bellicks sacrifice in season 4. Some say he was redeemed while others say he doesn’t deserve redemption and others say he does but hadn’t done enough to earn it. I’m somewhere in between these.

First, let me talk about the 2 things people most often talk about when arguing why Brad was irredeemable. 1, he killed Marilyn (Charles’ cat) and set up Tweener to be raped by putting him in a cell with Avocado. While I agree these are not justified or excusable by any means I think there’s some things people forget or ignore in the larger context of the story.

As for Charles’ cat, people forget this was an act of revenge and not an act of pure cruelty. The reason Brad killed Marilyn is because Bob, a new and young CO who Brad felt a particular duty to protect and oversee, was brutally killed in that riot. After asking Charles for information on the killer, he doesn’t give anything up even though he knows. From Brads perspective, this is not only a betrayal by one of his friends but also him standing in the way of justice for the sake of a man who murdered a very young CO. Again this isn’t to justify or excuse what he did, but people often say “he killed a cat” as if he did it for kicks instead of during a very emotional and visceral time in his life.

As for what he did to Tweener, there’s nothing to really justify or even complicate that. He’s a man who sees criminals as inhuman, and he does anything to get what he wants. He *was* trying to get info on Michael, but it’s still inexcusable and horrible. However, id like to argue that the fan base tends to give more grace to other characters for their terrible actions (examples being Mahone and Kellerman) when we don’t give the same to Brad. Both Mahone and Kellerman killed piles and piles of innocent people, and they may have had more justification for wrongdoing than Brad, but it doesn’t change the fact that so many innocent peoples lives ended because of them. 

So what exactly do people need to see from a character in order to deem them worthy of redemption? If you look at Mahone and Kellerman, there’s 4 things that I think make their redemptions work respectively. They admit their wrongdoings or lose their positions of power and realize what they’ve done, they attempt to stop acting in the way they have been, they face some kind of retribution or punishment, and then they try to make things right by doing as much good as they can. All four of these things happen to both Mahone and Kellerman, and they happen to Brad too. He loses his job as CO, tries to off himself, and then tries hunting down the fox River 8. This lands him in Fox River after being falsely convicted of his “friends”murder (poetically in the same cell he put Tweener in, with Avocado) and then he gets out of jail only to end up back in an even worse prison while hunting down T Bag. There’s an important moment in that, but I’ll get to that later. I think his retribution is realized in Sona. He’s left with no clothes, no food or water, he’s tortured with hot coffee pored down his back, at deaths door nearly all the time, gets himself almost beaten to death in a fight all so Michael’s plan can go forward, etc. Of course, having shitty things done to you doesn’t make up for what you’ve done, but I think Brad genuinely changed before the start of season 4.

At the end of season 2, Brad pretends that he kidnapped Maricruz to make Sucre do what he wants, but he didn’t actually do anything to her. I think an older version of Brad would’ve done anything to actually have a bargaining chip on Sucre, and this version of him doesn’t do that. That doesn’t make him a hero or anything, but I think it signals that he is changing for the better. After Michael & Co break out of Sona, Brad actually saves Sucres life when Sona burns down in a riot. He gets him a ride with his mom, and Sucre probably would’ve died without his help. And then of course, in the first third of season 4, Brad sacrifices himself (likely by drowning, a rather painful death) so that Michael’s plan can go through. Without Brad’s sacrifice, the Company would probably still exist, and who knows how many innocent people would be killed or destroyed to keep them in power. It *is* a sacrifice that does a lot of good. 

To summarize, Brad goes through all the same plot points of a redemption arc that Mahone and Kellerman go through, but receives a lot less grace from the audience likely because of the sensitivity of what he did. People are desensitized to killers in media, but it’s particularly disgusting to see an animal killer and a person who gets another person raped in media. These things are both true, but I think his development was more earned than most people give it credit for.",2,1757986610.0,PrisonBreak,0,1.0,False
1ni4gay,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtHomeEssentials/comments/1ni4gay/car_windshield_cover_vs_ice_scraper_whats_the/,Car windshield cover vs ice scraper: what's the difference?,"Hey everyone! As someone who's dealt with winter car troubles for years, I thought I'd share my experience with car windshield covers and ice scrapers. Trust me, I've learned these lessons the hard way!

Last winter was particularly brutal where I live, and I found myself spending way too much time scraping ice off my windshield every morning. It was seriously cutting into my coffee time, and my arms were getting tired of all that scraping!

So, what's the real difference between using a car windshield cover and an ice scraper? Let me break it down for you.

Ice scrapers are the traditional go-to tool. They're cheap, portable, and get the job done... eventually. But here's the thing - they require physical effort, can potentially scratch your windshield if you're not careful, and you're still standing out in the cold doing all that work.

I recently switched to using a car windshield cover (I got mine from https://athometouch.com/car-windshield-cover), and it's been a game-changer. Instead of spending 15 minutes scraping ice every morning, I just pull off the cover and boom - clear windshield! No scraping, no scratching, no frozen fingers.

The best part about windshield covers is that they're preventive rather than reactive. They stop ice from forming in the first place, which is way better than dealing with it after the fact. Plus, they protect your wipers from wear and tear during those nasty winter storms.

I've noticed some other benefits too. My cover doubles as a sun shield in summer, keeping my car's interior cooler. It's also helped prevent bird droppings and tree sap from messing up my windshield - bonus points for versatility!

Sure, ice scrapers are cheaper initially, but think about the time you're wasting every morning. Not to mention the risk of scratching your windshield or damaging your wipers. I've found that investing in a quality windshield cover (like the ones at https://athometouch.com/car-windshield-cover) pays for itself in convenience alone.

Here's my practical advice: Keep an ice scraper in your car for emergencies, but use a windshield cover as your primary defense against winter weather. Your future self will thank you when you're not standing outside in freezing temperatures every morning!

I should mention that cheaper covers tend to fly off in strong winds or tear easily. It's worth spending a bit more on one that's well-made and properly sized for your vehicle. Trust me, I learned this after going through two cheap ones in one month!

Hope this helps some of you make the switch before winter hits full force. Your morning routine (and your arms) will thank you!

Anyone else made the switch from scraping to covering? I'd love to hear your experiences in the comments!",1,1757986575.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

1ni4dgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueScaryStories/comments/1ni4dgs/i_saw_hooded_figures_in_my_old_high_school_and/,i saw hooded figures in my old high school and nobody believes me,"(for starters, i know this sounds insane and fake and if you don’t believe me, that is alright. but if you’d like to hear me out, please give your thoughts on what i could have possibly stumbled upon the other night.)

i, a 21 year old girl and my 2 friends of the same age are always hanging out with each other when not busy with work and other responsibility’s. we went to the same k-12 school together, met in 6th grade, and have been inseparable ever since. 
our school is one gigantic building pretty much in the middle of nowhere. we live in a very rural county so our towns are bare and there isn’t much to see besides farms and drive through coffee places. during the summer, the school sat basically deserted with nobody coming in and out other than in the mornings once in a blue moon to prepare for the upcoming year in september. 
i’d see the occasional family set up on the elementary section of the building, taking advantage of the empty playground and letting their children use it while i drove past to get to my job. there’d sometimes be some people also taking advantage of our schools walking and running track but it wasn’t common. other than that this place was basically void of any activity. 
with us being graduated and into our young adult years we obviously haven’t been back to the school for any reason. 
it was about 10:15 ish at night and my friends, Mason, Emily and i were all sitting in Masons car in a mostly empty gas station parking lot while we chowed down on the snacks purchased from there. it’s not that important, but all 3 of us are goth and it’s a reason why we are so close, and a reason why we enjoy the creepier things in life. so when Mason suggested we drive around the back roads where all the deserted homes and cemetery’s were, Emily and i happily agreed. her and i loved to point out the beautiful neglected victorian homes, and what we’d do with them had we any money. 
we spent about half an hour looking at homes and headstones on graves, before finally getting back into the main road and heading back to Emily’s apartment where we planned on sleeping over. it was Emily’s suggestion that we stop at our old high school and creep around for old times sake. so we did. 
Mason pulled into the empty parking lot, and all of us got out and made our way to the high school and middle school section to look around. we all told stories and reminisced about our time there, really emphasizing how much we hated it honestly. Emily and i went to the middle of the building, where the cafeteria for the middle school and high school was and started into the giant window. all we saw in the dark were stacked chairs, and stables all stored nearly in one corner. the only visible light was coming from appliances and other things left plugged in, along with a few small recessed lights in the ceiling. Mason had gone to the other side of the building, to peak into the window of our old home room, which we thought nothing of since we live in a safe for the most part area. 
amongst all the posters i saw on the walls of the cafeteria about nutrition and other things, something below them suddenly caught my attention. an intense, dark crimson red color caught my attention in the low light when i realized the cloth was covering a human figure. it was impossible to tell if the worsen was a man or woman from where we stood but i knew it was a person. a person wearing a dark red cloak and they were just standing there, arms sticking straight out at their sides with their head aimed towards the floor. they had a hood over their head so i saw no face. i was scared shitless, immediately feeling my stomach churn with dread unease. i shook Emily’s shoulder while i whispered to look. she was confused, but went silent as she saw what i had been talking about. 
“what the fuck is that?” she whispered to me, not taking her eyes off the hooded person. 
our horror and curiosity was interrupted and worsened when we suddenly heard Mason yelling for us, and his footsteps fast approaching as he ran along the side of the building to where we where. 
we couldn’t tell what he was saying, but stood up from where we crouched. 
suddenly Emily screamed, grabbing my arm so tightly i felt every one of her finger tips pinching my veins. the shriek that came out of her was like nothing i heard before from anyone, just pure fear. she began dragging me away from the window and it was only when i looked up as i was being pulled away that i realized, the hooded person was standing right behind the glass. they had their head still tilted down pushed against it, and i still could not see their face. i too began to scream and scramble to get myself upright and running. like i said, we’re all goth and for some reason insist on wearing black dresses that are far too long. so i’m tripping, trying not to stumble over my dress and platform boots while we sprint to Masons car. Emily is in tears by the time we get in, and Mason peeled out of the parking lot so fast his tires spun and squealed on the pavement. 
we sped down the empty main road, still freaking out repeatedly yelling “what the fuck? what the fuck was that?” 
and after a few minutes of incoherent rambling Mason finally gets out what he’d been trying to tell us at the school. 
“i saw 3 people inside, they had weird fucking robes on and we’re lined up against the wall with their backs facing out.” 
i told them that we needed to call the police to tell them people might have broken in, but they pointed out how what we were doing was sketchy. not illegal, but you have to realize we are the only goth people in a town full of people who live by “god, guns, and country” and we had serious doubts they’d believe us let alone be on our side. 
my only guess was they were some kind of cult or something, but what were they doing in a school? 
none of us got any sleep that night. 
i’m not sure how to summarize what happened. i told my family, but they think im just being dramatic and trying to scare my younger siblings. i was in near tears before my parents half heartedly validated my concerns. 
i haven’t gone back to my old high school since and i never will. ",3,1757986351.0,TrueScaryStories,2,1.0,False
1ni4bmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1ni4bmw/the_many_lives_of_danny_rensch/,The Many Lives of Danny Rensch,"[The New Yorker: The many lives of Danny Rensch](https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/the-many-lives-of-danny-rensch)



As the face of [Chess.com](http://Chess.com), Rensch helped change the culture of the game—and found himself transformed in the process.

Danny Rensch grew up in a village on the edge of a great forest, in the mountains outside Payson, Arizona. He spent his days with roving packs of children, building forts, playing cops and robbers in the woods, or splashing around in a septic dump, unmindful of the shit and of the bears and javelinas that sometimes came down from the hillsides in search of food and water. When Rensch was nine, he saw a movie, “Searching for Bobby Fischer,” about a boy in New York City who plays chess in a public park with homeless men and discovers that he’s a prodigy. Rensch and his friend Dallas found a cheap chess set and started playing constantly. One day, Dallas took Rensch to play chess with his grandfather Steven Kamp.

Kamp was not just Dallas’s grandfather; he was the leader of a cult to which almost everyone in the town, Tonto Village, belonged. The members of the Church of Immortal Consciousness, also known as the Collective, followed the teachings of a Dr. Pahlvon Duran, who, they believed, lived the last of his many lifetimes as an Englishman in the fifteenth century. Duran spoke to the Collective through Steven’s wife, Trina, and he preached that the goal of life was to fulfill one’s “Purpose” and to live “in Integrity.” Ego was discouraged. So was private property. Families were moved from house to house, and were sometimes reconfigured, too. Rensch had only recently learned that Dallas was actually his stepbrother.

Like most of the members of the Collective, Rensch often didn’t have enough to eat. At times, he didn’t have shoes. Kamp had his own house. He had Cheerios and cigars. He also had books about chess and his own wooden set. He had been following the world championship in New York between Garry Kasparov and Viswanathan Anand. Kamp, a good chess player, saw that Rensch had talent. “Chess made me special,” Rensch writes, in “[Dark Squares](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1541703286),” his new memoir, “and to be special in the eyes of Steven Kamp is to be special in the eyes of God.” (Kamp could not be reached for comment. He has previously denied that the Church of Immortal Consciousness was a cult.)

Chess has been viewed as a measure of intellectual potential for centuries, and Kamp was eager not only to promote the Church of Immortal Consciousness but to dispel the notion that it was a death cult or a dangerous militia group. What if he could boost the profile of the Collective with a successful chess team? The group’s children were in a unique position to undertake such a project. They shared a sense of common mission, instilled in them by Kamp. Traditional schooling was easily ignored. And chess could become a means to privileges: trips to McDonald’s and Taco Bell and out-of-town tournaments.

The kids played for hours every day, with a sense of freedom, and, for a time at least, they had a lot of fun. In 1996, the Shelby School—an unchartered charter in a tiny town on an Arizona mountainside, which the kids attended—placed fourth at the national elementary-school championships, conducted by the United States Chess Federation. In 1997, the school won the U.S.C.F. Super Nationals scholastic championship. In 1998, it won the national elementary-school championship, the K-9 championship, and finished in the top fifteen of the K-12 championship, despite not having any high schoolers. “Cults work,” Rensch writes. “Until they don’t.” Rensch won the national elementary-school championship that year. Trina, channelling Duran, told Rensch that chess was his Purpose.

For a time, Rensch was moved to a house that the Collective owned in Phoenix, to be near the city’s chess club, a hangout for oddballs, chess enthusiasts, and one honest-to-God chess genius, a raging alcoholic named Igor Ivanov, who’d defected from the U.S.S.R. and suffered the usual deprivations of a vagabond professional chess player. Ivanov became Rensch’s personal coach. Most mornings, Rensch would find the man sprawled naked on a bed, and would dutifully fix him the day’s first screwdriver. After Rensch’s rise in the game slowed, when he was fourteen, he was taken from his mother and installed in the home of Kamp’s right-hand man—who happened to be Rensch’s biological father, and who seemed to harbor no feeling for him. Kamp told him this was all for the good of his Purpose.

Rensch’s Purpose, according to Kamp, wasn’t just to play chess. It wasn’t even to become a grand master, though that was the marker of his ambition. His Purpose was to *save* chess. Doing so, as Rensch puts it in his book, “would prove to the world that \[Kamp’s\] spiritual vision held the key to understanding human nature and the meaning of life.” Rensch was convinced. “I believed it because I was a child and it’s what I’d been raised to believe,” he writes. But he also wanted to do it for his own reasons. He wanted to make the game seem fun and normal, not “dysfunctional and weird.” He wanted to make it so that the pinnacle of chess achievement didn’t look like tormented, self-destructive figures such as Ivanov but a guy like him, Danny Rensch.

At the age of eighteen, not long after winning the national high-school chess championship, Rensch’s eardrums exploded on a flight on the way home from a tournament. He tried to return to serious competitive chess in his early twenties, but it was becoming clear that his progress had stalled and his goal of becoming a grand master, let alone a top one, was fading. By then, he was married—in the Collective, early marriages were common—and had two kids. (He and his wife, Shauna, eventually had two more.) He was still driven by a belief in his chosen status, but his life was a mess. He began to make a little money coaching chess. He also started drinking, taking painkillers, suffering from panic attacks, and compulsively buying up chess domain names: chessface.com, chesscoachlive.com, and so on. The one he wanted, Chess.com, was already taken. But, at a tournament in 2008, he met the guys who owned it—Erik Allebest and Jay Severson—and badgered them into giving him a job. Only later did he realize that he was lucky that he didn’t badger them out of one.

Maybe they were lucky, too. In 2010, they created ChessTV, with Rensch as its star. I first encountered Rensch in 2016, on a [Chess.com](http://Chess.com) YouTube show called “ChessCenter.” My boyfriend, now my husband, had introduced me to the game, and I’d quickly become obsessed, waking up at 4 *A.M.* to play on my phone. Some couples watch Netflix together; we watched Sicilian Defense instructional videos. We also tuned into live streams of pro tournaments, and we caught up on news by watching “ChessCenter,” which was a little like ESPN’s “SportsCenter,” if “SportsCenter” ’s soundstage was the walk-in closet of a law office in Payson.

The show was hosted by Rensch, who had become an international master, and Robert Hess, a Yale-educated grand master from New York. Hess talked about chess with a sense of gravity that went beyond interest or mere passion; an elegant move or complex position would light him up. Rensch, on the other hand, was excited about *everything*: chess, sure, but also CrossFit, coffee, his kids, shouting “premature attackulation!” when a player launched an attack too soon. (As much as Rensch had wanted to play like Fischer, he wanted to be [Stuart Scott](https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/12118361).) The Chess.com platform was a little janky, with glitches and gaffes galore, and seasoned players were forever complaining about the bugs on Reddit. (The cool kids, I quickly learned, were playing on a different website, Lichess, which was open-source.) But this was part of the charm. Chess.com maintained deep commitments to accessibility and education. Its tutorials were popular, and its shows were gaining followings. Plus, it had that domain. If you wanted to pick up chess, you went to Chess.com. On “ChessCenter,” chess wasn’t a formidable game played solely by snobs. It was intellectual and beautiful and serious, but also competitive and fun. You could make mistakes.

Rensch wasn’t the only person to realize the potential of chess as online entertainment—something that could be not just played but watched, discussed, argued about, obsessed over, endlessly consumed. But he was an evangelist, and he was willing to do almost anything to spread the gospel. (My husband met Rensch through his work, and for a brief period Rensch even recruited me to write blog posts for the site about my humiliations as a novice chess player.) Perhaps Rensch’s key contribution to Chess.com was his recognition of the power of influencers, before anyone was using that word. He helped bring grand masters and a host of popular chess streamers into the Chess.com fold, for events or as brand ambassadors: Alexandra Botez, Anna Rudolf, the Chessbrahs, Daniel Naroditsky, Ben Finegold, and dozens more. The site sponsored [Hikaru Nakamura](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/the-most-popular-chess-streamer-on-twitch), a top player who soon would become one of the most popular e-sports live streamers in the world. Rensch also convinced famous athletes and e-sports stars to play in Chess.com events and to hype the game, on camera, riding the wave of celebrity promotion. He networked and appeared on panels at the M.I.T. Sloan Sports Analytics Conferences. He helped Chess.com seem bigger than it was, and then get bigger as a result.

Few of the people Rensch met in these years knew what he was going through at home, in a crumbling community, as he was reckoning with the trauma of growing up in the Collective. (The Church of Immortal Consciousness has since disbanded.) Perhaps he was not fully aware himself: by his own account, that awareness required a lot of intensive therapy. And I didn’t know, even though I had seen it for myself. My husband and Rensch had become close, and we visited him in Tonto Village in December, 2019. We baked Christmas cookies and played with the kids; I briefly met Kamp. I wandered along the empty paths of the village, through the half-vacant clusters of cabins and trailers, with my toddler strapped to my chest, until collarless dogs, their teeth bared, drove me back.

A few months later, the *COVID*\-19 pandemic arrived, and the world discovered what Rensch had hit upon a decade earlier: chess is a great game to play online. Then “[The Queen’s Gambit](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/the-queens-gambit-is-the-most-satisfying-show-on-television)” premièred on Netflix, and the game’s popularity boomed. In just a few months, [Chess.com](http://Chess.com) transformed from a relatively niche website into an online behemoth with hundreds of employees and hundreds of millions of users, and into a company worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with Rensch as its chief chess officer and its public face.

There is an irony in the arc of Rensch’s life that is not lost on him. As soon as he let go of the idea that changing the chess world was his purpose, which was a burden that he had carried for much of his life—as soon as he had started to reckon with his arrogance and desire for attention—the chess world actually changed, and he was in the middle of it all. In his memoir, Rensch expresses a degree of discomfort with the role he now plays. “Who nominated Danny Rensch to have so much influence over so many aspects of the game, from the way it’s taught to the way it looks?” he writes. “More importantly, who appointed me the arbiter of fair play? Nobody.”

Online chess has a rampant cheating problem, and Rensch’s role at [Chess.com](http://Chess.com) has required him to act as judge and jury. Rensch writes at length about the century’s most notable cheating scandal in chess, which arose when [Magnus Carlsen](https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/what-magnus-carlsens-jeans-have-to-do-with-chess), the world’s best player, insinuated that the grand master Hans Niemann had cheated in a match—allegations that Niemann has denied. At the time, Chess.com was in the process of buying Carlsen’s company, Play Magnus Group, and Carlsen’s father asked Rensch if Niemann had ever cheated on Chess.com. Rensch knew that Niemann had, and he’d dealt with it as he often did in these cases, by quietly giving Niemann a second chance. But, after Carlsen’s statements, Chess.com analyzed the situation, and Rensch went public with what he knew.

Many people were unhappy with the way Rensch handled it—not least Niemann, who sued Rensch, along with [Chess.com](http://Chess.com), Carlsen, and others, for a hundred million dollars each. (Part of the lawsuit was dismissed, and the rest was settled.) There was another, quieter irony in this. Niemann grouped Rensch and Carlsen together, but it was Niemann whom Rensch identified with more. In Carlsen, Rensch saw the person he had dreamed of becoming—the world’s greatest player, someone who had made chess seem cool with his brilliant play and by the force of his personality—and had failed to be. Rensch hadn’t cheated, but he had long recognized something of himself in Niemann, “a talented, troubled kid who was painfully alone in the world.” Rensch had changed, and in doing so he realized his real purpose: to entertain and encourage the human capacity for connection, in chess and in all else. There is also some purpose in pointing that out. ♦",3,1757986215.0,chess,4,0.67,False

**Context:**
My employer requires I come into the office twice a week but due to my symptoms that entirely impossible. Currently I have struck a deal that I will come into the office for two half days a week, which currently is the maximum amount of time/pain I can withstand. Ideally I'd work from home entirely as driving one hour each way in traffic and sitting in an office chair is too much for me. Even the current deal is actively setting back my progress in PT and often leaves me in so much pain im bed ridden the following day after coming in. I don't even shop for myself anymore, I have my groceries delivered as its too painful to walk around a store.



**PROBLEM:** My problem is however, work has been requiring I send a doctors note *EVERY WEEK* but my doctor pushed back and has been sending them every two weeks writing them for two week periods granting me permission to only come into the office two HALF days a week instead of two full days. In general this feels excessive and slightly insane given I'm required to send almost weekly notes just to work in office only half the time currently. These aren't even notes for missing work, I still log a minimum of 45hrs a week up to 60hrs some weeks. 

HR has even pulled me into their office multiple times to hint that I'm faking my issues or I'm being dramatic but has been sly about there verbiage but not entirely sly because I've noted everything that's been said and I'm starting to feel harassed at this point.

**Extra Info:**
I didn't add a ton of detail about my medical issues but there is more than just back pain and I'm currently working with multiple doctors to figure out what the heck is even going on with me because some of my symptoms are pretty severe. 

I just feel like work is really putting the screws to me for no good reason other than trying to make me fall in line with their crazy policies. 
For context of this work places toxic environment we aren't allowed to eat lunch at our desks or drink from open coffee mugs (regular coffee mugs) and the bathroom has light timers set to 5 minutes, there is more but I'm trying to wrap this up. 

I should probably look for a new job but I CANNOT afford a gap in healthcare right now while I'm trying to figure out what's going on and I've already hit my 7k out of pocket max and I want to get some more expensive tests ran before the new year since I've hit my max. 

**TLDR;** work is requiring weekly or bi-weekly doctors notes in order to reduce time working in office by half

In addition, in late 2023 I had a flood in my flat, which my landlord did not dry out properly, so I ended up with a very serious mould problem. I did suffer with a worse bought of it between 2013 - 2016, and that was constant, every day. My doctor wasn't very good on this issue and it was only when I moved in 2016 that another doctor took it more seriously and gave me medication that killed it. This more recent bought was not so severe but I did have oral thrush last year as well. The oral thrush was killed a few months ago and I finally killed down below candida on Friday and am so happy! 🥳🎉😃

My question is in what order do you all re-introduce banned foods? I'm starting very slowly and haven't added anything back in as yet. I want 4 clear days and then will start with tomatoes, then potatoes, etc. After veggies it'll be fruit, dairy, smoked food, dried fruit. At that point, probably 2-3 months, I'll probably add decaf coffee. Am a coffee-head, I don't drink loads, but really enjoy what I have. I would like to drink full caffeine but am happy to stay on decaf for a few months while my stomach recovers. Caffeine is one of the last items to be added, in probably 6 months from now. I will only add a new item every 4 days. This is how I did it last time and it worked. Between 2017-2020, when candida-free for about 9 months, I could eat anything I wanted no problem. Am really hoping for the same this time.

1ni49i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortinet/comments/1ni49i0/fortinet_certified_professional_fcp_study_guide_a/,Fortinet Certified Professional (FCP) Study Guide – A (?) Definitive Guide,"Alright friends, I’m sorry in advance, this post is long. And sorry for taking so long into getting this completed, just got caught up with work... Yeah! that's my excuse alright? Deal with it! - Without fugther ado, grab a snack, maybe a coffee - definetely a coffee!, and let’s go.

This is my attempt at putting together a guide for anyone going after the Fortinet Certified Professional, specifically the Network Security track. You’ll see people call these exams easy, others call them tricky. The truth is somewhere in the middle. What you’ll get here isn’t a magic bullet, but a mix of resources, lessons learned, and what worked for me.

So yeah, buckle up. Or don’t. I’m not your boss.

 

**Quick Disclaimer**

* Everyone learns differently.
* This worked for me, it might not for you.
* If you fail, blame Fortinet, not me.

 

**Main Materials**

The first stop: Fortinet’s Free Training – [http://training.fortinet.com/](http://training.fortinet.com/)

Yes, it’s free. Yes, some people complain that it’s dry. But honestly, it’s solid. If you’re broke or lazy (or both), start here.

Is it enough to pass?

* Short answer: No.
* Longer answer: Maybe. Depends on how much you lab.

Hands-on experience is what makes or breaks you. The free training covers the theory, but you’ll need to actually click around, break stuff, and then fix it again.

My main study combo:

* Free Training (self-paced modules)
* Labbing. And more labbing. And when you think you’re done? More labbing.

 

**Secondary Materials**

Sometimes Fortinet’s explanations feel like they were written by a bored robot. That’s when YouTube and other sources come in.

Big shoutout to Devin Adams on YouTube:

His videos on FSSO are old but still gold. If you’re struggling with concepts like active vs passive auth, his playlists will save your sanity.  
  
Watch videos, research is your best friend!

**My Study Plan**

Here’s how I structured things without losing my mind:

1. **Lab Setup**
   * If you can, get your hands on a demo device. Beg your account manager. Borrow from work. Bribe someone.
   * No hardware? Spin up FortiGate VMs in GNS3, Proxmox, or ESXi.
   * For FortiManager, I ran the VM trial on an old PC with Proxmox. Worked fine.

And yeah, I broke my lab environment more times than I can count. That’s the point. You want to mess things up, then fix them. That’s how you actually learn. With FortiManager specifically, test everything: workspace modes, approval flows, order of precedence. Break it, fix it, repeat.

1. **Daily Flow**
   * Tackle one or two modules a day.
   * Pause on every concept, go into the lab, and test it.
   * Order of precedence is huge. Don’t just skim, actually try it.
2. **Review**
   * Next day, rewatch modules at 2x speed.
   * Recap while it’s fresh, fix gaps, and reinforce stuff.
3. **CLI Practice**
   * Don’t get tricked into thinking exams are all GUI. They’re not.
   * Know your CLI basics, commands, and outputs.

 

**The Free Exam Questions**

At the end of the official training, Fortinet gives you free practice questions. Do them.

Why? Because they’ll show you exactly where you’re weak. Maybe you thought you understood a topic, then the practice questions slap you across the face. Good. That means you know what to review.

Pro tip: when you hit areas that feel fuzzy, don’t just shrug. Go back, lab again, check extra references. You might even… let’s just say… find “other sources” online... What you do with that info is up to you (Wink – Wink).

 

**Booking the Exam**

When should you book?

* When you feel about 70% confident.
* Too early and you’ll panic.
* Too late and you’ll burn out.

I studied \~2 hours a night, with breaks. After about 1.5 weeks, I felt ready enough to book.

  
**My rule:**

* No cramming the night before.
* Stop studying one days before the exam (or that’s me at least)
* Use that time to rest, maybe review flash notes, but don’t stress yourself out.

 

**Exam Day Tips**

* Sleep. Seriously. Don’t zombie your way into the testing center.
* Read every question carefully. Some are worded to trip you up.
* Flag questions you’re unsure of, move on, then circle back.
* Use elimination if you’re stuck. Sometimes you can sniff out the wrong answers fast.

 

**TLDR - Yeah for the lazy ones LOL**

* Use Fortinet’s free training.
* Lab until your FortiGate cries for mercy. Break stuff, then fix it.
* Supplement with YouTube (Devin Adams is great).
* Do the free exam questions. They reveal your weak spots.
* Build a study plan and actually stick to it.
* Don’t cram the night before. Sleep.
* Exam isn’t impossible. If you understand the “how” and “why,” you’ll pass.

 

**Final Words**

Don’t let the exam scare you. It’s not rocket science, but it does expect you to understand what’s happening under the hood. If you’ve labbed enough, broken enough things, and actually fixed them, you’re good.

And hey, if you fail the first time, big deal. Learn what tripped you up, go back, lab some more, and take it again.

**You got this. Chef’s kiss. Good luck.**

Also, Can't strees enough how handy this community has been! Thank you for the support and for those who are thinking of getting certified, or even need help with Fortinet in general, you are in the right place... Trust me! This subreddit is full of smart guys who really give care about you.. if you read this, you know who you are.

Let’s call him B. For context, B doesn’t make very much money and he burns through the money makes quickly. I make significantly more money than he does, and I’m very good with my money. Despite making a barely livable wage he continues to promise me yearly vacations, fancy dinners, and other special dates that he absolutely cannot afford and just aren’t realistic for the foreseeable future.
  B is a very loyal partner, very caring, emotionally available, and the only man I’ve ever truly considered marrying. We often talk about our future together, and he has very high hopes for our life; a nice house, frequent travels, nice cars, etc. The only problem is that he has no money and just trusts that everything will ‘come together’ and we’ll be well off in the future. He hasn’t held down a job for more than a year in the time I’ve known him, usually not by choice. He started his current job about 6 months, at the time he received 2 job offers. He accepted the offer that paid significantly less. 
   I’ve always been driven to make money. I never wanted to be dependent on anyone and I worked my ass off to stay out of debt, pay off my car, and save up a substantial chunk of change. I’m at a place where I can afford to travel, or probably even enough for a down payment on a home. I’ve held off on those plans for now because I want my partner to be able to contribute.
   I’m becoming resentful that B’s not rising to the occasion or driven enough to negotiate a higher pay at work, earn a promotion, or apply for jobs with a higher starting wage. We’ve had a lot of conversations about it. About a year ago we signed our first official lease together and I told him that I really wanted him to make some progress and be better with him money now that we were splitting rent. He’s been short on rent often and I know his parents have been sending him money to help him get by. 
We just resigned our lease and I feel like I made a huge mistake. I love him, but I can’t get over the disproportionate income. I tried my best to find us a cheaper apartment than I could afford so he could reasonable afford the shared rent, I’ve helped him work out a budget over a dozen times, but none of it helps. He continues to spend money on weed and video games, but I’m left paying for groceries, household expenses, coffee runs, and dinners out. He’s promised to fix his resume and look for higher paying jobs, but he never does. 
    I really wouldn’t mind being the breadwinner of the household, but we’re not married. This has really gotten under my skin over the last year and while I love him I just cannot stand his lack of drive and immature excuses. He doesnt take responsibility for his poor work performances, lack of follow through on his promises, etc. I need advice.

I’ve done extensive blood work, CT, ECG and a chest Xray. All have been clear so far. I do have an upcoming ENT appointment and Neurologist. I’m also doing a sleep test this week. It happened in July of this year randomly after waking up. My blood pressure had dropped to the lower normal range (100-105)/70-77. My pressure is back up to 115-120/77 now, but I feel the same. The feeling is like being frozen, and disassociated from my body for a few seconds, almost like I’m about to faint, but haven’t. It usually happens more after eating, although I wasn’t able to pinpoint a particular group of food or ingredients. 

This has taken a told on my life, as I can barely make it 8 hours at work and had to take time off.

My lifestyle consisted of me working 2 jobs, and mostly the night shifts and not sleeping too much or sleeping too much sometimes.

I am desperate to change my practice. I applied to a firm a couple of months ago and ended up getting rejected.

Later this month, I am having coffee partner there who is in a different lit group than the one I applied to. I met them at a networking event and reached out to before applying. I thought they had a really good energy and they expressed eagerness in getting to mentor young litigators. I am not sure how to play it. Do I bring up the rejection? Treat it like normal networking? Is it weird to go since they didn’t hire me? 

I am still interested in working there, even if in a different group, so I don’t wanna make things awkward or come off bitter. At the same time, ignoring it feels strange.

Has anyone been in this situation before? What’s the best way to handle it / what should i say (or not say)?

Rent is 2700/month + utilities. 

Your room is the larger of the two, with two windows and an extra storage space above the closet.

It’s a spacious and sunny apartment in a great location, with a large deck where I grow flowers and herbs 🪴🪴

- Dishwasher 
- Washer/dryer
- Mini split A/C
- Very high ceilings
- South facing windows in the bedrooms
- Large deck (one step to get out to the deck)
- 2nd floor walk up (apartment is on the “third” floor. There’s two steps into the building and then two flights of stairs up) 
- Spacious bathroom w/good tub (important to me as I take baths) 
- Short walk to Cooper Park. Slightly longer short walk to McCarren and McGorlick Parks (I go to the farmers market at McGorlick pretty often) 

One small-ish pet is tentatively okay on the lease. Caveat is I’m technically allergic to cats/dogs (though I do love them and many are fine), so would have to meet your pet first to make sure I don’t implode. Dog in the photos isn’t mine! 

I’m a queer 29 yo (they/them), work in catastrophe modeling, dream of someday living in a cob house. I love to cook/bake, walk around with a coffee, find outdoor yoga classes, and am perpetually discovering a new hobby I ~ wish ~ to pick up. 

Ideally looking for a woman and/or queer roommate who is clean, okay with (occasionally) having friends over, and wants to join into my lil corner of home. I love both a good roomie bonding activity and just coexisting/parallel play. Most important to me is a comfortable and cozy living environment w/open communication. I live with a chronic illness and chronic pain, so that often determines my energy levels (still figuring out my exhilarating life with it, but if you need a foam roller I have options).  

I can be a night owl, so ideally looking for someone who jives with that and/or is not a light sleeper. 

I am medium-covid conscious. I mask on public transit and essential places (grocery stores, etc). I have a very ill sibling, so it is important to me that we are on the same page about health communication. Very happy to chat more about what this means to each of us 🙂",1,1757984350.0,NYCapartments,0,1.0,False

For a couple years I was the only one in my role, so I could work from home for weeks and nobody would really miss me. But the CEO is the kind of guy that believes if he can’t see you, you aren’t being productive, and he would start keeping your bonuses. Even from his lake place. (We all knew who the rats were)

It was every horror you can think of. Vaulted cement ceilings, loud air handlers, bad lighting, all the way on the other side of town from my house. 

I was minding my business one day when a recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn. I usually ignored them because they were obviously spam. But this guy seemed kind of real and I was particularly unhappy at work that day, so I gave him my personal email. 

Four interviews and 12 days later I accepted a fully remote gig. The company doesn’t even have an office, so no RTO demands headed my way. Straight salary that is the same as what I made if the CEO felt like giving me my full bonus. And the culture is amazing. Need to run the kids to school? Absolutely nobody cares. Want to work from a coffee shop all day? Live your life.

I told her I'd be going in a tux and would like her to wear a gown if she was coming. She told me then and there that she didn't want to attend and I expressed a little sadness and asked why. She told me that she didn't ""like dressing up for anyone"". I rebutted by mentioning the conversation we had a month ago wherein she said that she wanted me to dress nicer for her all the time, and that I was asking her to dress a little extra nice for only one evening. 

Skip to two week ago, I asked if she was actually not coming and she said that she would for me but that it wouldn't be any fun and she didn't really want to. I told her if she didn't want to she didn't have to and she asked if I would be sad and I told her the truth, yes. 2 days after that she says she doesn't want to go and I reminded her that she didn't have to and she told me she thought it was ""performative bs"" to get dressed up for other people. I said she didn't have to get too dressed up but that I would be in a tux and there would likely be a lot of photos and I know appearance usually matters to her. She then said shed wear her gown and lamented about not having any shoes. I tried to bridge the gap by buying her some shoes I knew she loved. I foolishly thought she would at least be excited to show them off. 

Skip to the day of the event (3 days ago) and we had a busy day. I had to bathe my cat (a real hassle), we were going to the gym, wanted coffee and lunch before the party, and had to go pick up the shoes and a vest for my tux since my cummerbund had gone inexplicably missing. I had had an idea to make our own masquerade masks and also brought her to a cute art shop to buy the supplies. As the event drew nearer I could see her mood shifting (not assisted by her period setting in) and I told her once more that she didn't have to go, she asked again if I would be sad and I truthfully (foolishly) replied yes. When got in the car to leave she began the silent treatment, I couldn't get a word out of her so we rode in silence. We arrived at the event and it was obvious she immediately wanted to leave. She would barely speak (only enough to not look like a dick in front of people I have known since 1st grade) refused to dance, and ducked out of any pictures she might have been in (even ones that weren't of her). She left early after 2 hours and promised to get me when the party was done. 

I called her around 2am and she picked me up as promised. she was pleasant on the ride home but the second we got to her apt she voiced her upset. She asked why it was so important to me that she attend and I told her that I gave her multiple outs. She said I pressured her into it, I rebutted that I had only stated my honest emotions about the incident, and any pressure she felt was internal. Then the real fight began. She asked me why I would want to participate in that anyway. I said because every once in a while its nice to dress fancy and cut loose, she asked why I would want to participate in such a performance and why I would want her to as well. I told her that when I look at her all I see is beauty regardless, but that my friends don't have the same love-goggles and I want them to see what I see. She HATED that. She asked why I needed her to impress my friends? Did I think she usually looked bad? Why do \[I\] care what they think? Why should she? Why \[am I\] so shallow? Why is it fair for \[her\] to have to do these things? I told her I was probably being a little petty but that their opinions mattered because they're the closest people in the world to me. I told her nobody thought she looked bad usually and that I didn't think it was outrageous to ask her to dress a certain way for 1 night or to hope my friends would think my girlfriend is as beautiful as I do. All of that fell on deaf ears, she clearly thinks it IS unreasonable. The fight got worse when I told her that I didnt see why it was so bad for me to ask for this when she had told me that my appearance could/would be a deal breaker if I let it go and reminded her all the ways shes asked me to trim down my personality for her parents. I told her I think its way more severe to ask me to withhold parts of myself from her parents and to hold me to her personal visual standards than it is for me to ask for fancy dress one night. We both got emotional and apologized and the fight ended and we went to bed.

Or so I thought. about 2 hours ago she called me at work and asked to talk since I was on my way out. She said she was still bothered about the other night. I asked why and she restated all of her arguments and says that she thinks its shitty to ask her to put on heirs for my friends. I must admit, I got defensive and a little angry. I repeated that I didn't think it was unreasonable and that wanting to show off your girlfriend every once in a while isn't a sin. She called me possessive and said that you show off items and pets, not girlfriends (objectification has always been a sticking point with her). I told her that I thought that was the least generous accounting of the event, and that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being proud of your partner. She reiterated that I was wrong, and thats when I got very defensive. I told her that it was less wrong than issuing an ultimatum based on how I dress daily, and much less wrong than telling me I have to curb my personality for her  parents. I told her that my friends were important to me and that she didn't even have to put in that much effort. And she responded by stating that it didn't matter because she didn't care what they thought, that in a year either she or we would be moving and she wouldn't see them again. That hurt so I asked if she knew why that might be a mean thing to say to her partner, she responded ""its the truth"". At that point I was truly frustrated so I told her that I don't think any of this is fair and that it seems like she didn't want a dialogue but rather a groveling apology (in addition to the apologies we had already proffered) and I told her that she was clearly lashing out because she didn't get one.  She didnt like that and basically shut down. the conversation ended with me expressing frustration, telling her that I still loved her and saying good bye to which she simply responded ""bye"" and hung up (she knows I try to maintain loving language, even during fights, and she did that intentionally). 

Am I the Asshole? Was I objectifying her? Is it wrong to want to ""show-off"" your partner? Is it okay that she basically said she doesn't care about my friends at all? Was it okay for me to bring up the stuff with her parents and the way I dress? Was I wrong to stand firm and not grovel? Am I wrong to assume there's something deeper here? Is it wrong to tell your partner that you'll be sad if they don't attend an event with you? Is that manipulative? Should I have apologized?",1,1757984264.0,AITAH,17,1.0,False

I'm visiting Riga for the first time in October, and I'm looking to do some things off the beaten path, more like the artsy/hipster/kitsch b side style. Specifically, I'm looking for:

\- Places to buy weird/old Latvian or other International magazines (I make collages)  
\- Places to buy fanzines or other similar visual art  
\- Coffee stores with athmosphere, distinct deco or ambience (can be art-based coffees)  
\- Cult bars / bars with live Jazz / bars with Latvian music (I also prioritize ambience here)  
\- Places to buy random antiques, not the high end ones, but the random cheap junk (can include ex-soviet things)  
\- Small alternative art galleries  
\- Art or music festivals  
\- Any other thing on this vibe you can recommend :)

Thanks, will make some art with your recommendations :)",2,1757984263.0,Riga,0,1.0,False
