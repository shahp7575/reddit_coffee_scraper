1gii5e3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gii5e3/aita_for_starting_an_argument_over_a_cup/,AITA for starting an argument over a cup?,"Tonight I started an argument over the color of a cup with my husband. On Halloween my oldest son (16) took his siblings (f10 and m8) out trick-or-treating. One house handed out large plastic cups filled with store bought candy. My youngest picked a purple cup and my daughter picked a green cup. When the kids got home I went through my son's candy and my husband went through my daughter's candy to check for suspicious tampering. 
After going through the candy in my son's cup, I handed the cup to my daughter and told her to put it in the kitchen so the cups could get washed before use. She did but left her cup on the coffee table. I got home from work today and noticed it still sitting there as she was doing the dishes and reminded her to wash it.
Bedtime roles around and my youngest asked for a glass off water and went to use his purple cup. His sister started arguing that the purple cup was hers. I asked her what color the cup on the coffee table was today and she said green. I reminded her of the events on Halloween night and how I had sent her into the kitchen with her brother's purple cup that night. 
She threw a fit causing my husband to jump into the discussion. After some back and forth she angrily suggested we ask my oldest son. My husband agreed. This made me angry so I asked him to step outside so we could talk. I tried to tell him I felt betrayed that he didn't trust my recounting of events and he told me he wouldn't tell his daughter she was wrong without more proof. We argued for 30 minutes until my oldest got home and confirmed my daughter's cup was the green one. I then tried to reiterate I was angry because he didn't trust me and refused to tell his daughter she was wrong. AITA?",1,1730621539.0,AmItheAsshole,1,1.0,False

I live in a city with a historical Italian population, and it's own extended, historic Little Italy neighborhood. I've been to Italian restaurants in that neighborhood and throughout the city.  Traditional iItalian, modern Italian,  fusion Italian, specifically Sicilian, Tuscan, Sardinian etc.,  Italian American, Italian owners, not Italian owners, fine dining, not so fine dining, etc. The whole gambit. But, I have yet to get an espresso after dinner that wasn't flat, boring and more like reduced coffee than a rich espresso. Never any crema.  Now, at home my espresso comes from very darkly roasted beans from an old Italian man who's family has been roasting coffee in that neighborhood for nearly a century.   So, I'm used a strong, dark, single-minded espresso, as opposed to more modern light or medium roasts with that mix of bright, fruity flavors. From my many cups at those restaurants in the city, it is clear that many of those Italian restaurants use similarly dark roasted beans. When I go to the traditional Italian cafes in the same neighborhood, I get espresso like I make at home, rich, good mouthfeel, just a bit of crema (though admittedly, better prepared). But that restaurants, even with a big, expensive espresso machines on display (I do realize that doesn't guarantee anything)  so consistently put subpar espresso on the table with my cannoli, it's just no longer a surprise. 

My only guess is that restaurants almost always have large amounts of old, utterly degassed beans. And darker beans degas faster. But, all of them, all of these restaurants, all the time?

I used to be a coffee bean snob. I am very particular about how a coffee bean is roasted. I used to favour high quality artisanal, light roasted coffee beans.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caff√® Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don‚Äôt like coffee and ¬£2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Steps:

* Download the Caff√® Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/JNe8xFjdvLb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caff√® Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the ‚Äúwallet‚Äù section then ‚Äúvouchers‚Äù. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Long story short, i'd been on wellbtrin + abilify combo for nearly 6 months and recently got off from SSRI (After taking more than 2 months) cold turkey.

It's been 6 months since the last dose of wellbtrin and abilify and 2 months from SSRI

But I'm still having these weird symptoms :

Feeling depressed for no reasons \[Sometimes it lasts 24 hours\]  
Suicidal ideation  
Low motivation  
Lack of physical energy \[but not too severe\]  
Mood swings

I'm not a doctor, but basically i'm having all the dopamine lacking symptoms.  
Coffee usually helped but didn't last long enough and got even more depressed.

I went to visit almost 5 doctors but they didn't really give me a straight answer.

Do you think i should try out some dopamine medications to trigger damaged nerotransmitter?  
I don't think using stimulants is the answer.  
getting back on SSRI will definetely make things worse in the long run.

Let me tell you, I have given this thing a world of chances, I bought it due to the need to produce/render 8K 360¬∞ video for VR and figured the chip and in particular the ProRes encoders would be ideal. That part hasn't specifically been a failure but it is far from keeping the overall satisfaction level out of the mud.

macOS is an absolute piece of garbage and honestly I wish the Unix group would revoke Apple's licence to use it. macOS users will say, ""it's not worse, just different, you just have to get used it"" which is what you'd expect from brainwashed morons with no grasp of reality. 
There is a grand total of *1* function in macOS Finder that is better than Win.Explorer and that is that you can select files from multiple folders and subfolders from a single window. But not being able to create new folders unless you directly open the parent folder, not having a proper transfer rate indicator and not even being able to reliably delete files from a USB drive (and the files thus being removed from view but still psychically consuming space, forever sacrificed unless you reconnect the drive to the exact same Mac!! ü§¨ü§¨) without a 4-finger key combination are not ""subjective differences"", they are inherently poor operational decisions. 

And now what I thought might at least be the saving grace of all this garbage, the ""highly optimised hardware"" has fallen victim to what I suppose I already knew was the second-biggest complaint about buying into Apple [behind the exorbitant and let's face it, quite frankly extortionate, hardware upgrade pricing]: the forced obselecence. 

My battery on this 16"" never did reach the 21 hours promised, my best reaching about 6 which was still a lot more than the 9th gen i7 I had replaced with this MacBook. And there was a specific app that could drain the whole battery in under 80 minutes if I let it run the whole way - and that would supposedly have been leveraging one of those famed ProRes engines which should have meant lower power draw compared to an on-core process. 
But having travelled recently I decided to let the battery run through a cycle before digging into my suitcase to find the charger, only to hear the Mac pinging the low battery alarm at me before what seemed like barely enough time to even have made a coffee and drunken it. Definitely was not more than an hour as the lecture I was listening to on YouTube had not yet concluded. 

This is on top of the growing experience I've had recently that the ProRes (and other) media engines that were the core reason for this purchase, don't seem to even be in the same ballpark as their previous achievements. I regularly work with 30min, 8K video files and these would take 2-3 mins to generate a 1080p ProRes proxy file in Da Vinci Resolve Studio. Now I'm seeing that this process can take anything up to 17 minutes although it does seem to average around 7-9. 
And encoding h265 with the Video toolbox, the on-board encoder in the same media engine, used to see about 180fps in 1080p video or about 80 in 8K, now barely breaks 60 and 30 respectively. 

I believe I started this mac on macOS 12 and have moved it to 13 and now 14, while I've been hesitant to go to the now-standard 15 for fear of further losses in performance given that those ""upgrades"" would seem to be the most likely opportunities for Apple to remove certain optimisations for older processors in the attempt to encourage an upgrade to the newer models. 

It's been quite the journey and I am at least happy that I can now quite legitimately state from a position of tortured experience rather than one merely of complacent contempt that Apple really does suck the biggest, fattest, juiciest turd-roll of any IT operation on the planet - and I say this with some authority as I worked in Support roles for a good part of my career.

However, back when I was growing up as a child when the entry below is about, it was definitely an issue because I did not know or have the words to describe what was happening and what I was going through until I became much, much older as a young adult.

Im 30 years old now. Growing up my dad (64 now) was very aloof but still in the picture and married to mom. He basically couldnt talk to us (my brother and i) unless it was about coffee or Ultraman. Anytime me or my brother tried to talk to him as children, it would be one sentence replies or the conversation would be extremely short, we all thought that we did something wrong all the time growing up because dad wasn't a nice person that would talk to us, despite being our dad. It felt like being constantly disapproved of at 4 years old.

The only time we could ever talk to him is if we ended up talking about something that he cares about, which is totally out of reach for us as kids. Like coffee, for a 4-5 year old, is not a suitable topic. And 1970s live action figure Ultraman is also not that accessible as a topic for children born a long time after the release to talk about, too. Basically these were the two things anyone can talk to him about. Other than that the conversation would go nowhere. And honestly, I feel like mom only stuck around out of stability.

Growing up in the 2000s, many kids my age grew up watching Hallmark and other feel good movies on TV was a common experience among many children, to see perfect family members on TV and everyone have a typical functional nuclear family. I developed cognitive dissonance pretty early because my dad is present, but he wasn't ever trying to talk to his kids, or have fun with them. It felt like he was just a housemate whos just there.

In high school, things became a lot worse with how the family dynamic has become as both myself and my brother matured and realize things. Having to see my mom juggling the role/job of two parents, where she would be finding and sending both my brother and I to extracurriculars and tutors, as well as meeting teachers at school often to talk about college for her children, while my dad never participated into these things. As usual, dad never did anything, except the rare occasional picking us up from school/extracurricular because mom wasn't available, where it was very matter of factly-- he'd just arrive to pick us up and we left back with him, that was it, nothing fun to report about. 

I was so glad to finally move out during my college years from such a weird family environment. And it wasn't until during my later years of college that I realized my situation wasn't normal. Most people who grew up with a father around had a normal experience eg. they can have full conversations that don't die with their dads, or they didn't have their father in the picture, usually raised by a single mom.

It wasn't until I ran into someone, let's call him Tom, who had high functioning autism in a group event that it dawned on me about how my dad was probably struggling with autism or some other behavior disorder and couldn't become a proper parent. 

Meeting Tom and talking to him more in depth about how autism is a spectrum and how so many checkboxes of autism applies to my dad made me realize that my dad wasn't deliberately really hateful or neglectful of his children out of malice or disdain. It was probably because of some form of behavioral disorder that was never identified and fixed that he ended up like this. 

Plus, it's way too late to get help for someone in his generation and his cultural background. So now I'm basically here working in therapy to better learn how to forgive my dad for his autism and him being neglectful to us as children, and coming off as hating his own kids and going to therapy to reverse the damage of seeing how mom had to handle solo parenting alone despite dad still being in the picture.

We were just colleagues, but our dynamics were kinda different from the usual co-workers'. We were close. As someone who easily gets attached, I developed some feelings eventually. I bravely told you, but quite unfortunately, it wasn't mutual. It was sad, but I was cool with it. It took a while, though, before we got back to the way we were. You reached out first, that I gotta say.

Our interactions were just limited to working hours (tho there were quite a  few times when we'd send messages outside work). Although we're just colleagues, our ""relationship"" was a rollercoaster ride. We had a lot of arguments, disagreements and what-not with some of them leading to us spewing harsh words towards each other or blocking each other from that comm app. You once told me that in one of our ""episodes,"" you were bothered and thinking of something I had said while you were doing your annual rock climbing. But then, after some time (with one or two of them just being hours after), we'd patch things up like nothing happened and we're happy colleagues again.

One thing that puzzled me, though, was you never invited me for coffee or anything or offered me anything. This despite me teaching you a lot of things and being always available when you had questions at work. Not that I wanted something in return, but I mean, we're friends. You told me we were, and that you appreciated me as a person. 

When I had the courage to tell you this in one of our rollercoaster episodes, you told me you were not someone to invite anyone to a coffee or offer anything. Later I found this was untrue because one, I overheard you asked some colleagues if they wanted something because you were to order your lunch, another colleague said you would do that for other as well, and the final straw was when I saw your response to a comment asking the person to catch up over coffee.

When I confronted you about it, yes confronted because I felt so hurt, and asked why you never ever invited or offerred me anything, your response was ""just because."" Never had I felt so small and insignificant because here I was  holding this someone dear, only be reduced to ""just because."" I don't know if any other reason would've made any difference, but those two words really stung me to the core. And when I pressed for clarification (yeah, pathetic me), your response was ""fix that with yourself, I have done nothing to you."" And that was it.

I am still hurting, but I will soon heal from this. But I will never allow you or anyone from doing this to me again.",1,1730618136.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

1gigzhq,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1gigzhq/a_letter_to_the_next_person_who_gets_to_love_her/,A letter to the next person who gets to love her. ,"Sometimes she wakes up in the middle of the night and her hands are numb. She‚Äôll shake them frantically in a panic. You have to hold her hands and wiggle her fingers and have her squeeze yours until she can feel them again. You have to make sure she falls back asleep before you do. 

She wakes up thirsty a lot. She needs a full bottle of water by her side of the bed. Better if it‚Äôs two. Let her sleep on the outside of the bed because she will have to pee at least twice in the middle of the night. 

When she wakes up in the morning one of the first things she wants is coffee. She likes it fresh. She likes it with butter in it. 

When she talks to you, you should look her in the eyes. It lets her know that you hear her. She likes it when you give input on the things she‚Äôs saying. She needs an intellectually and emotionally stimulating conversation. 

When she sends you a song, really listen to the lyrics. Even if she just thinks you‚Äôll like the music. Words mean a lot to her. 

Make sure to remind her every day that you love her, and don‚Äôt just call her beautiful. Tell her she‚Äôs funny, and smart, and kind. Notice when she does her makeup. Compliment her outfit, and her eyebrows. Once a day isn‚Äôt enough. She needs to hear it as often as you‚Äôre thinking it. 

She‚Äôs gonna try to leave the house and drive without her shoes on, and she will likely forget her inhaler. It‚Äôs important to suggest she takes shoes, and don‚Äôt let her forget that inhaler. She might say she‚Äôs okay without it, but you don‚Äôt ever really expect an asthma attack. She needs it. 

Don‚Äôt let her pay for everything even if she offers. She won‚Äôt say it, but she needs to be pampered, too. Get her makeup and nail polish. Take her out for sushi. She might tell you she only wants a California roll, but she really likes the spicy tuna. She loves her moms tacos, and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies. 

She needs to listen to ASMR to fall asleep. For this to be the most effective, it has to be quiet. ASMR is already quiet. She has to be able to hear it. You might not always want to, but turn off the tv. Your games and shows will still be there. She has to sleep. That‚Äôs more important. 

When she‚Äôs depressed, play Lady Madonna by The Beatles. Put on Grease, Hot Rod, or Harry Potter. Ask her to show you her favorite TikTok‚Äôs. When she‚Äôs anxious, sit beside her and remind her that everything is okay. Tell her you aren‚Äôt mad at her. Tell her nothing bad is going to happen. Stay calm, and she will be calm. Stay patient. It might take some time. Don‚Äôt give up. Don‚Äôt let her be upset alone. 

Don‚Äôt raise your voice. 

Encourage her. To draw. To write. To make that change if she wants it, whatever it may be. If you ask her to color you a picture, she will. So ask her. 

Even if you don‚Äôt have the same interests, invest your time in hers. This is non-negotiable. 

If you need help, you have to ask her. Don‚Äôt assume she‚Äôs going to do something. She doesn‚Äôt owe you anything. 

Don‚Äôt make her feel like you think you own her. You don‚Äôt. Allow her to make her own choices. Allow her to feel her feelings as they come. 

She loves to spend time with her mom and her sister. She would prefer it if you were included. Go with her. 

If she doesn‚Äôt want to cuddle for long, don‚Äôt take it personally. She gets too hot really quickly.  Make sure she has a fan on her at night. She‚Äôs a human heater. 

Don‚Äôt touch her feet when she‚Äôs sleeping. Don‚Äôt touch her armpits at any point in time. She really doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs funny. 

Truly cherish her. If she‚Äôs giving you a chance, she wants to. Make her believe that it‚Äôs worth it. Don‚Äôt let her leave without telling her you love her. Even if you‚Äôre mad. 

If you‚Äôre upset, tell her that. Be transparent. Don‚Äôt let her wonder if she did something wrong. Don‚Äôt let her think she isn‚Äôt good enough. 

Make her laugh. Wipe her tears. Give her hugs. Give her space when she asks for it. 

Most importantly; do not lose her. She wants you to fight for her. She‚Äôs worth fighting for. 

‚Äî With all of that being said, I will always love her. She will always have me. There really isn‚Äôt anyone else. I‚Äôm not even entertaining the idea of anyone else. I want her to be happy. I want her to be the happiest she‚Äôs ever been. I want all of her dreams to come true. I want her to love being alive. I want her to love herself. If I never see her again, I will still spend the rest of my life loving her the very most. 

‚ÄúDreams last so long. Even after you‚Äôre gone. I know that you love me, and soon you will see. You were meant for me. And I was meant for you.‚Äù  ",16,1730616067.0,letters,11,0.94,False

This was honestly one of the worst experiences of my life, and I feel like I dodged a huge bullet.

It started out as a typical day - I was in a coffee shop, grinding out school requirements on my Acer Predator Helios 300. The place was cozy, coffee was good, and the laptop was handling my workload like a champ. Once I was done, I closed the lid, put it in its laptop pouch, and headed home. Standard routine, right?

Fast forward two hours later, and I go to grab my laptop to finish up a bit more work. The second I open the bag, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve opened the lid of a boiling pot. My laptop felt like it was radiating the heat so much heat. It had somehow turned itself on inside the bag, building up insane heat. When I touched it to pull it out, it actually burned my thumb pretty badly. And the smell? Straight-up burning plastic. At that moment, I was sure my laptop was done for.

I panicked, set up my cooling fan, and aimed every fan in my room at it. I let it cool off as much as possible before daring to turn it on. Miraculously, it still works - but the experience was so bad, I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone.

Lesson learned: if you‚Äôre getting a gaming laptop, just don't or yet be extra careful. Always shut it down completely, or at least double-check that it‚Äôs actually in sleep mode before storing it in your laptop bag/container. And to anyone thinking about getting an Acer Predator (or maybe any gaming laptop, honestly), just know that they can heat up *fast*. This thing could‚Äôve melted in there, and it almost fried my thumb. So yeah - be careful out there!",8,1730615114.0,GamingLaptops,0,1.0,False

","I'm an adjunct psychology professor, currently in the process of preparing course materials for next week. I wouldn't mind being finding myself a someone to chat while I am doing this.

The rest of the day, especially during the transitions from dawn to dusk, holds a special place in my routine. These moments are reflective, offering a unique perspective on the world, and I often find myself lost in thought during these times.

Not only am I surrounded by a crew that cares about each others' wellbeing, but I feel like this is one of the few jobs where I'm actually able to express myself in a creative way that is able to bring a smile to someone else's face! Yeah, our customer base can be shitty sometimes, but it's those few people that shine brighter than most and just really make my day. 

Earlier this week, I had to give a Coffee Tasting to my Store, Regional, and District Manager as part as my Coffee Master Training. I was stressed beyond belief because I have severe anxiety and am a full-time college student with very little free time. I also didn't exactly know where to start with all of the preparation, so because of this, I, admittingly, was freaking out a good bit. I chose Guatemala Casi Cielo for the brew, to pair it with some chocolate croissants and gouda cheese, and tell a heartfelt story of the last time my family had taken a vacation together (my father passed last June). Low and behold, my boss springs on me the night before the presentation that we will NOT be doing my chosen blend, but rather Christmas Blend to ""ring in the holiday season."" This sends me into a panic and I start doing research on the blend and what to pair with it. It takes me a few hours, but I decided to pair it with homemade gingerbread cookies. Come to find out, those take a while to make, and I'm at 6 hours till the presentation, so I say ""fuck it!"" and go to the store to pick up Snickerdoodle cookies. I also should mention that I was simultaneously making pulled pork for the team meeting later that night, so I had my hands full. I make sure to shower and dress nice (but in dress code) for the presentation. Once I get to my store, the fear starts to set in and I'm on the verge of a panic attack. But one of my shift supervisors and several coworkers tell me that I have nothing to worry about and that I'm going to do great no matter what. When the presentation comes around, I'm able to somewhat go through it smoothly and even learn some insides about the changes that are coming to the company. Afterwards, my boss commends me for a flawless presentation and I am in shock. I thought I hadn't done that well, given it was my first time, not only doing this sort of presentation, but using a french press too. But then I got to thinking, what if that was the purpose? I know my SM didn't mean to change blends on me last second, but part of our job is being able to adapt on a whim's notice. And I think that's beautiful. 

For an entry level job, we're able to learn skills regarding teamwork, create art in a consumable form, and, honestly, get paid an amazing wage! This job can be insanely stressful sometimes and I empathize with y'all's posts that I see regarding your experiences, but personally, I couldn't be more grateful for this job. Idk, I just wanted to share how much I love what I do and show that there are bright sides to our job! Obviously, I'm not going to be able to work with the Siren forever, I'm working towards a Psychology degree and a future in Counseling. Just being able to have a job that I feel is hard to leave is hard to come by these days, and I'm thankful to have it and to be able to call my coworkers my friends.

I shrugged off my jacket and slumped into the barstool with a heavy sigh. Baritone set himself lightly on the chair across from me. I knew the rest of the crew had the ship well in order, even after the ordeal, and I owed Barry an explanation. I owed everyone an explanation. Damned if I could think of what it was though.

Barry waited patiently as I perused the bar menu, settling on the ever ubiquitous Black Hole. Didn't matter what bar, whether the hoity-toitiest high-rise or the slummiest dive; everywhere in the Realms would sell you a Black Hole. Wasn't always the same drink though. That's what made it an adventure. Barry ordered something through his deep, warbly translator and before long we were both cautiously nursing our drinks. Surprisingly, mine was drinkable on this planet. Tasted like vanilla root beer, with a kick.

""Ok, ok. I s'pose I oughta start near the beginning. Ever heard of a planet called Earth?""

Barry shook his eyes. ""Who would name their planet 'dirt?'"" he intoned. I couldn't help but laugh. ""Well, Earth also means soil. And we had a fair bit of that too. But way off in the Western Spiral of the Milky Way Galaxy, is a Class M planet in the Goldilocks Zone of a class G yellow star. That's where I'm from. Where my species is from. I was born elsewhere, obviously.""

""Obviously"" came the translation. I couldn't tell if he was being sarcastic. Barry was a tough nut to crack, but one hell of a sensors officer. If my own mother had half as many eyes as Barry, I might've turned out all right.

""Anyway, just under three-quarters of Earth is covered in water, which makes the name even more ironic, I guess. And before Terrans reached for the stars, they sailed by them on the oceans. I ever tell you that Earth is a deathworld?""

Barry blinked rapidly. Two of his eyes darted around the room, looking to see who was listening. The other four were transfixed on me. I knew the bartender was listening, but on this backwater I knew he was the good kind. The quiet kind. Half therapist, if I got any drunker. I took another sip from my Black Hole. Tasted like blueberry tart.

""Yeah. You ever why you don't see many of us out here, it's because of that. You know the kind of clearance, or the laws you have to break, to get a Terran starside? I do. Anyway. Reason I tell you that is to tell you that you do not mess with the oceans of Earth. When we were a young species, our superstitions and traditions were as watertight as Religion. The oceans were vast and were as like to kill you as any predator on land, only with less malice. The sea was too big to care about you, or your ship. And there were things that lurked below the surface of the waters, in the open ocean. I think you saved us from a cousin of theirs.""

Barry spluttered into his drink. The translator attempted to turn that into speech, which was hilarious because it sounded like a confused badger with a trombone up his.. Well. Didn't sound like words. A few patrons looked our way. I noticed a couple taking seats nearby.

""Remember when I came onboard, and the crew wanted to rename the ship? Bad luck I said. But I was new to the crew, even as captain, and I went along with your traditions. Remember what happened next?""

Barry nodded his eyes. ""Three months in quarantine and a pirate raid.""

I smirked. ""And when I put the transponder back to the 'MS Piggy' and painted a pig's snout on the nose of the ship?""

""We were out of quarantine and found the pirate ship derelict on our route, with all our cargo still in their hold, within the day."" Barry's translator was almost reverent. Almost.

""We Terrans hold fast to our stories. And one that comes up time and again are the stories of Sirens."" We had started to get a crowd, so I picked up my jacket and my drink and made my way through the bar to an empty table a little left of center. More than a few patrons followed and I smirked. Everyone loves a good story. Sailors most of all. Another Black Hole appeared before me. I looked at the bartender and he gave a curt nod. I saluted him with my drink and took a pull. Bitters and mint. Goddamn this was good.

After Barry had settled in across from me, I raised my voice. ""All right lads, lasses and everything in-between. Now hear the tale of the Miss Piggy, and her escape from the Sirens of ‚Ä¶ "" my voice trailed off.

""Cypris Six,"" shouted someone from the back.

""Cypris Six! Now, Sirens are an ancient evil. Created by the gods to tempt sailors, they were shaped as beautiful women, with the wings of a grand bird, and deadly talons of the same. It is said that their voices could pierce the heavens and bring even Angels to their knees. Their song rang out over the ocean, calling to sailors to make landfall. Promising them rest from the weary work of trolling the seas, and a good time in the moonlit sands besides."" Several voices cried out in laughter.

""But they were tricksters and liars, for Sirens resided on islands deep in the open sea, amid hidden reef and hull-piercing rock. Scattered in the deeps below their islands were the bones of the ships foolish enough to heed the call."" The crowd jeered.

""Such was the foe that we faced when we entered the Oort cloud of Cypris Six. And it was Barry here who saved us all from drowning in the open vacuum of space."" I [retold the story](https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1gcglyl/comment/ltw5weu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) of our long journey to planetfall, taking extra care to put Barry at the forefront of the tale. Terrans were rare this deep in space, and I'd learned long ago that what I considered normal was anything but to most of these old hands. Besides, Barry had saved all our asses. Barry himself seemed rather embarrassed, but took the praise and congratulating back-slaps with practiced ease. He was an experienced sailor, after all. Probably had a story or two to tell himself. Barry provided detail when I couldn't, on account of me being in the hold. The crowd was especially impressed with his description, in monotone, of the ships graveyard. What surprised me most was that more than a few folks nodded. This wasn't a glitch, or a sensor failure. Something was out there.

""And that,"" I declared, ""is why you always take an old sailor seriously. You never know what's lurking in the deep, but he does."" The crowd cheered. Someone put another drink in Barry's hands. I was on my third Black Hole, and I'm pretty sure at that point Barry had at least a dozen eyes. Maybe two dozen. Once they figured out there wouldn't be a follow up tale, the crowd started to break up. I leaned over to Barry and said ""Now, I know you're not drunk, so go have a listen around and see if anyone lets slip anything useful. I want more dirt on the merchants, but what I really want to know is what the hell is going on with that graveyard.""

Barry bobbed a couple eyes my way, and set his drink down. Within seconds, he disappeared into the throng of the bar. I think. It was pretty blurry.

So imagine my surprise when a beautiful blonde, feathered, half-naked man with tawny brown eagle wings and bare clawed feet sat down in front of me. With a quirked eyebrow he said ""Well, that certainly was a tale. Ancient evil, really?""

1gignqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1gignqf/big_bad_scary_ammends_finally_done/,"Big, bad, scary ammends, FINALLY done","I wanted to share about an amends I was finally able to deliver today and the impact I'm feeling from it. I don't expect anyone to read all this, I just needed to write it down. 

Back story: in my early 20's coming out of trauma and diving into addiction, I started an affair with what turned out to be a married man who was nearly 20 years older than me. I continued the relationship when I found out he was married with kids for a while and we ended things. The relationship rekindled as I approached my bottom in my mid-late 20's. This time there was a lot of drama with his wife. She was very aware of me and what we were doing. I talked to her a few times even when I felt I had no other choice after being contacted. It got ugly, needless to say and I behaved in truly despicable ways. The things I did and the harness I caused as the result of that affair are the most shameful things I've done. 

I started getting into recovery at 29. I quickly learned that his wife, I'll call her Bette, has a long and active history in my local, small town, AA community. She was even my sponsors first sponsor, which I didn't learn until after I picked her (My HP is funny like that üòÖ). No one has seen Bette at a meeting since covid, at least, so I've never seen her around, but carried a looming fear in those early months that I would see her around. Over time the fear faded, I never saw her, and became very active in meetings and go to many. Of course Bette came up in my 4th & 5th and I wrote an amends to her. My sponsor and I suggested I wait in delivering it, as it could possibly do more harm than good. 

Fast forward to early this summer, I'm at my home group, cleaning up from making the coffee as the meeting is getting started, and I see Bette. The absolutely blinding fear that overtook me was devastating. These meetings are my safe space, my family, my medicine, and it suddenly felt like I was that same old, fear driven person who did those terrible things when I was sick. I knew I couldn't sit through another meeting feeling that way, so I worked with my sponsor and did a lot of praying for the willingness to approach her if I ever see her at a meeting again and ask to deliver my amends. My sponsor and I had discussed what felt like likely possibilities for Bette to refuse to hear it or respond in an aggressive way, and I had made peace with whatever outcome, I was just responsible for cleaning up my side. Every Friday, I put my little hand written letter in my pocket and say a 7th step prayer as I get ready as a symbol to myself that I was willing. Never saw her again, been ready every Friday for 4.5 months. 

This morning I go to see a friend speak at this woman's meeting I occasionally go to. I'm sitting and catching up with some folks and as the meeting starts, in walks Bette. Instant panic, but this time I'm ready. I text my sponsor that she's there and I'm doing this. I then had to sit for the next 57 minutes and hand my will over and yank it back about 213 times as I tried to use every excuse possible to not have to go talk to Bette. Some examples include, ""my sweater has dog fur I didn't notice before leaving, I obviously can't do it in this!"" and, ""I wouldn't have had coffee if I new she might be here, I can't do an amends with coffee breath."" Absolute insanity and unmanageability. As soon as we circled up at the end to pray, I ran over to one of my Sponsee sisters who happened to be there, frantically whispered, ""I have to go do a REALLY scary ammends right now. Can you please wait for me?"" and I walked up to Bette. 

She was walking out, I said her name. When she turned, despite what I perceived to be a well deserved loathing glare, I some how found words to ask if she was willing to step outside and hear an ammends from me. After what felt like 30 straight seconds of heart-stopping silence, she answered with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm, ""Sure..."". 

I try to unfold the now worn paper, hands shaking, barely able to hear my own quivering voice struggling to say, ""Sorry I'm really nervous, I'm just going to read this..."" over my own defening heart. I read my letter, ask if I forgot anything or if I should know anything else, and I'm done. The blood rushing in my ears starts to quiet so I can listen. Bette tells me, ""no, I think that about covers it."" Then she went on to tell me a lot of stuff about her marriage and husband and some stuff about her recovery. At one point she asked me, ""how long exactly were you two together? I've never been able to get a straight answer out of him."" Even if I could remember, which I cannot, it did not seem helpful, so I told her I couldn't remember. She gave me a hug and I thanked her deeply for allowing me the chance. She didn't seem like she wanted to be best friends, but she was very kind and gracious. 

I have done many ammends at this point. Even a few that felt pretty big, like my ex husband and both of his parents, but y'all! I have been riding a high all day from that experience with Bette. I am still a little mystified that it all happened that way. Today I truly experienced HP doing for me what I could not do for myself. I have had this slow fulfillment of the 9th step promises, and today felt like a HUGE leap. I'll have 18 months next week and I think this thing is working ü•∞
