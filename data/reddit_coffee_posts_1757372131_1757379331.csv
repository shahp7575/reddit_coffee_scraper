1nc558e,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1nc558e/detailed_trip_report_paris_with_a_2_year_old/,Detailed Trip Report: Paris with a 2 year old,"Hello! This sub was helpful in planning my trip so I thought I'd return the favor with a detailed trip report.

We were in Paris from 8/27 to 9/3. We spent 9/3-9/6 in Germany so I won't really discuss that part here unless people have questions about it but I will say that I do highly recommend Heidelberg as an add on to a Paris trip.

First, a few things of note and then I'll share our itinerary:

Weather: I was fully expecting hot weather and we live in Alaska so we don't love heat. However, it was rainy and stormy most of the trip. Definitely should have brought nice rain jackets for everyone. Otherwise we did fine with shorts, t-shirts, and summer dresses for me.

Food overall: because of the toddler we did not do any fine dining. We primarily ate in bistros and cafes sitting outside, which worked well for my husband and I. Kiddo did not seem to be interested in the food and we struggled to get him to eat anything other than applesauce even though he's an adventurous eater at home. We had spent the last few months working on table manners with him and despite my fears (see previous post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1jc52j5/can\_we\_talk\_about\_french\_customsexpectations/) he really was on his best behavior the whole time. 

Literally my only issue with dining was that we preferentially ate outside to have more space for his stroller and for him to make noise if he was going to... and that's where everyone sits to smoke. It was so bad that he needed to go back on his asthma medicine mid-trip. So that's disappointing and something to be aware of.

Toddler specific: honestly kiddo did great and seemed to really enjoy the trip. I had no issues finding diapers, wipes, applesauce pouches, etc just at the corner market next to our hotel. He also really liked the squished pretezels in the blue bag. We have a small, foldable graco stroller and it did suffer a bit from how many miles we put on it but it worked great. For the bus he just stayed in the stroller, for the metro I carried him and my husband folded the stroller and carried it.

Language: I do speak some French. I did not find there was much issue with a language barrier. We had one server in a restaurant who did not speak English (which is fine) and got really frustrated with me (somewhat less fine). A lot of waitstaff and all of our hotel folks spoke excellent English.

Hotel: we stayed at Hotel Magenta 38 in Canal St Martin. The hotel itself was fantastic, the staff were so friendly and helpful, it had a high quality coffee machine in the lobby for unlimited use, it had a lift, and we were able to get a triple room for an affordable rate. The AC is pretty much exactly what you'd expect for a French hotel. The bathroom was massive. There was a balcony with a view of the Sacre Coeur. The neighborhood was not unsafe but also definitely not the nicest which wasn't surprising given how close it was to Gare de l'Est. On the other hand, there were tons of transit options close and a couple of nice bistros.

Itinerary:

Arrival Day: we flew Condor and had a nonstop flight from Anchorage to Frankfurt. We then took the ICE to Gare de l'Est, arriving around 8pm. We walked to our hotel. If I was to do this again I would have just booked a flight to Paris because a 3 hour layover and a 4 hour train trip (with train change in Karlsruhe) with a cranky toddler was not it. On the plus side, young kids ride free on Deusche Bahn... they certainly don't on Condor.

Day 1: aiming to take it easy, we slept in and then took a bus to the Marais to try our hand at Paris thrift store shopping. Kilo shop was the best of the bunch and worth checking out. Then we walked down to the river and on a whim, hopped on a Seine river cruise with Vedettes de Pont Neuf. 10/10 highly recommend this. We sat on the bottom floor of the boat in a row that was half glassed in, so that the toddler could sit right up to the glass. He loved it and it was a highlight of the trip.

Day 2: went to Jardin d'Acclimatation. Unfortunately it poured rain all day so this day wasn't as fun as it could be, but the kiddo still loved the park. We bought the 7 euro base admission and then a 50 euro book of attraction tickets and that was perfect for us. For older kids it would probably be worth it to just get the unlimited pass. Because of the rain we didn't really get to take advantage of the stuff there that didn't cost an attraction ticket, like the playgrounds and the splash pad but those definitely extend the value. Overall we thought it was such a sweet and thoughtfully designed park and perfect for 2+ years. We left the park and walked over to the Counterfeit Museum which my husband was really interested in. It was small but very interesting.

Day 3: took the transilien train to Provins. Walked this hiking path: [https://www.provins.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CR-hiking-PROVINOIS-medieval-city-of-provins.pdf](https://www.provins.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CR-hiking-PROVINOIS-medieval-city-of-provins.pdf) which was not very stroller friendly so if you want to do it, better to do it with a hiking pack. But other than that it was very cool and totally worth the effort. We had lunch in the tourist area and then took kiddo to see the horseback knights show which he really enjoyed as he's very into horses. Got some ice cream and headed back to Paris. Honestly not too much to say about it but Provins is a great day trip and not overcrowded at all. There's a ""tourist train"" that makes the loop but we walked.

Day 4: I booked a photo shoot with Krystal Kenney at [https://www.missparisphoto.com](https://www.missparisphoto.com) based on recommendations here. We ended up having our pics done by one of her associates, Julien, who was great. We met at the trocadero for the pictures (worth it! turned out so well) and then walked around the area a bit before we went to the aquarium which was nearby. Toddler is obsessed with aquariums and it was a hit. It wasn't busy at all so buying tickets ahead of time ended up being unecessary. We had dinner at a bistro called Lulu's close to the trocadero which was one of my favorite meals of the trip.

Day 5: Visited Jardin des Plantes. They are having some kind of serious technological issue with their ticketing system (it got hacked and still isn't fully operational) so word of warning on that. We went to the zoo in the morning which is very sweet but again, rain made it less fun than it could be. I liked that they had a lot of animals that I haven't really ever seen in a zoo before, like Pallas cats. Then we walked out of the park for lunch and back to the Grand Gallery of Evolution which was honestly mind blowing. Husband and I were in awe of it, toddler wanted to see more dragonflies. This would probably be much better for kids a few years older.

Day 6: Split day. I am really into birdwatching so I went alone back to Bois de boulongne to hunt for birds. It's a beautiful area to just walk around in and enjoy the nature. Meanwhile my husband took the kiddo over to Jardin Villemin to play at the playground. In the afternoon we went back to the Marais and then to la grande epicerie to pick up souvenirs for friends and family back home. Shopping isn't really fun for toddlers but he survived. La grande epicerie was cool but if I was replanning this day I would skip it. Maybe we're culinary scrubs.

Day 7: packed up our hotel room, had one last breakfast near the station (we really liked ""The Place To..."") and then got back on the ICE to head to Germany.

And that's it! We had a great time, kiddo loved most of it, and nobody got kicked out of anywhere or so much as a nasty look. Vacation success!",1,1757379003.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,1.0,False
1nc54xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntrovertDating/comments/1nc54xo/27_f4m/,27 F4M,"Hi I'm Lauren, 27. An introvert at heart but curious by nature‚ÄîI love deep talks about psychology, folklore, theology, and philosophy. I grew up on a farm, so I find beauty in simple things: canning, crafting, thrifting, or watching the stars.

At 19, I studied massage therapy, where I learned about healing and mindfulness, lessons I still carry. These days, I balance softness with resilience, solitude with the search for genuine connection.

I love horror anime, haunting music, gothic architecture, and stories that explore the shadows as much as the light. If you enjoy honesty, humor, and conversations that wander into life‚Äôs mysteries, we‚Äôll get along well.

Creating is my way of processing the world, of turning the ordinary into something meaningful, whether that‚Äôs through crafting, writing, or experimenting with scents and colors that lift the mood.

I‚Äôm naturally introspective, curious, and deeply empathetic. I love exploring big questions about life, faith, and the afterlife, finding beauty in the different ways people make sense of the world. I enjoy conversations that linger past surface-level chatter‚Äîones that challenge our thinking, make us reflect, and sometimes even make us laugh at the absurdity of it all.

Life hasn‚Äôt always been straightforward. Living with ADHD, autism, epilepsy, PTSD, and PCOS has shaped how I experience the world and how I connect with people. These experiences have taught me patience, empathy, and the power of perspective. I approach life intentionally, seeking connection, understanding, and moments that feel genuinely human.

I‚Äôm looking for someone who‚Äôs kind, curious, and playful‚Äîsomeone who enjoys both thoughtful reflection and spontaneous fun. Bonus points if you like getting a little messy with crafts, wandering through thrift stores, or debating the mysteries of life over coffee. Above all, I hope to find someone who appreciates authenticity, the quiet joys, and the small adventures that make life worth living.

Everything was going great until we had two very bad fights. We didn‚Äôt live together (she lives with her mother), but we usually spent weekends together.

One Friday, I told her that I had bought a PS5 PRO which she hated. She asked me if I really loved her, saying I was acting irresponsible and immature. I told her that wasn‚Äôt fair (it was my money), but she got very angry. 

The next day, we had a wedding to attend. I wanted to talk things out before the event, but she refused and said she was fine with going alone. I got upset and didn‚Äôt go with her. I was ready to end things, but 
a few days later, we talked things through (we both apologized, and agreed we wanted to make it work).

About a month later, we planned a trip abroad (and I also invited her to a weekend getaway at a nearby hotel). Both trips were amazing and we had a really good time. But once we were back, she called me and said she wanted to meet at a coffee shop to talk. I was a little surprised, but went with it (this was on a Friday, just a few days after we had returned from the trip).

She told me she wanted us to move in together, and that if I didn‚Äôt want that, then I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe one‚Äù for her. She said that I already had 10 years to do a lot of things, but she didn‚Äôt have that time‚Äîshe wanted to live with someone, get married, and have kids before turning 32.

We ended up having a big argument. I told her I wanted the same things, but naturally, in time. I‚Äôm divorced (no kids), and I explained that I wanted to do things right this time and not repeat past mistakes. I also told her that I help my family financially and that I‚Äôm saving for an apartment. Since she wasn‚Äôt working at the time (just looking for a job), I explained it wasn‚Äôt the right moment, but that maybe next year we could start looking into it, since it wasn‚Äôt a simple decision. The argument dragged on until I finally said okay, and that we could revisit moving in within six months.

I thought things were fine after that, but she started acting cold and distant, and kept bringing it up again. By then, I was exhausted and told her maybe we just weren‚Äôt meant for each other. A few days later, she asked to meet in person again. When we did, she gave me back all my things and told me she wanted to be alone.

All of this happened four months ago, and I‚Äôm still struggling with the breakup. I really loved her, and I feel discarded.",1,1757378848.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1nc51kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1nc51kr/i_practiced_boredom_for_30_days_and_it_completely/,I practiced boredom for 30 days and it completely changed my life,"I was addicted to distraction. Phone while eating, podcast while walking, Netflix while cooking. I hadn't been alone with my thoughts in probably 5 years.

The moment silence hit, I'd panic and reach for something anything to fill the void.

Then I stumbled across research showing that our brains literally need boredom to function properly. Creative insights, problem-solving, even basic self-awareness all happen during mental downtime.

So I made myself a deal: 30 days of deliberately seeking boredom.

What I actually did:

* Morning coffee with zero input. Just me, coffee, and whatever thoughts showed up. No scrolling, no news, no podcasts.
* Walks without headphones. 15 minutes daily of just walking. And thinking. Or not thinking.
* Meals as meals. Food and silence. That's it. Absolutely brutal at first.
* Bathroom breaks stayed bathroom breaks. No more scrolling on the toilet. Just sitting there and doing nothing.
* 5-minute wait rule. Before grabbing my phone when bored, I'd wait 5 minutes and see what happened. Most of the times I didn't scroll at it.

Day 3: I almost quit

My brain felt like it was vibrating. I was anxious, irritable, couldn't focus. I kept reaching for my phone and finding nothing there. It was like digital withdrawal.

Day 8: Something shifted

During my boring walk, I randomly remembered this song my dad used to play when I was a kid. Then I started thinking about calling him. Then I actually did call him. Best conversation we'd had in months.

That's when I realized my brain had been too cluttered to access my own memories.

Day 12: The idea came

I solved a work problem that had been driving me crazy for weeks. Just out of nowhere while washing dishes in silence. Then I got an idea for a side project. Then another one. I realized solutions come to us when we let our brains rest.

It was like my brain had been waiting for permission to think.

Day 18: I looked forward to being bored

This was the weirdest part. I started craving those quiet moments. My morning coffee ritual became sacred. The silent walks felt like therapy. I was happy to be alone and peaceful.

Day 25: Everything felt different

Colors seemed brighter. Food tasted better. Conversations were deeper because I was actually present instead of thinking about what to check on my phone next.

What actually changed:

* I remembered who I was. Turns out I have opinions, preferences, and ideas that aren't influenced by whatever algorithm I'd been feeding my brain.
* My sleep improved dramatically. When your mind isn't constantly stimulated, it actually knows how to rest. Who knew?
* I became a better friend. Really listening to people instead of waiting for my turn to talk changed everything. Friends started coming to me with real problems, not just surface-level chat.
* Work became easier. Problems that used to stress me out suddenly had obvious solutions. My brain had space to actually process things.
* I got genuinely excited about stuff again. When you're not constantly consuming content, small things become interesting. I spent 20 minutes watching birds the other day and loved every second.

30 days later:

* I still use my phone, but it doesn't use me. I still watch Netflix, but I also stare at walls sometimes. And those wall-staring sessions often end up being the best part of my day.
* The person I was avoiding with all that distraction turned out to be someone worth knowing.
* Try eating one meal today without any entertainment. Just you and your food. See what shows up in your head.

I have only left the house alone with her a couple of times, usually my partner will go with me if we take her anywhere. It was around 10:30-11:00 in the morning; I was on my way to my grandmas house, to spend the day with her & my mom with my baby. I decided to make a quick stop into the store to grab a coffee & an electrolyte drink. I was in the store for maybe 5 minutes. As I was walking out of the store doors I realized that I left her in the car and bolted to the car. When I realized I had left her in the car, the worst thoughts came into my head, I thought the car would be fogged up, I thought she would be screaming and crying and sweating and when I flung the door open and shook the car seat, I scared her awake. She was still sleeping, the car wasn‚Äôt hot at all, she was perfectly fine. But I am mentally and emotionally destroyed. I cried in the parking lot for 20 minutes before driving 10 minutes to my grandmas. When I got there, having to describe what happened to my mom caused me to have a severe panic attack. The reality that I completely forgot about my baby. Vision blurring, hands cramping, hyperventilating, so close to passing out that my mom was about to call 911.

I haven‚Äôt left the house alone with her since, I can‚Äôt. Everytime I leave a store and im walking to the car, panic fills my whole body. I am so afraid of my brain playing tricks on me or lying to me. I will be in the store, knowing that she‚Äôs at home with her dad but my brain will say ‚Äúare you sure? Are you sure she‚Äôs not still in the car?‚Äù I have to call him to have him reassure me that she is there and okay. I will never recover from this and I will never be able to forgive myself. I used to hear the stories on the news of the babies left in the car and think what kind of person can forget their baby? And now I am that person. I suppose this is just a post to vent. I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs any advice that anyone could give me that would make me feel better. I don‚Äôt know how many people have been in a similar situation. Just don‚Äôt think that it could never happen to you. I used to think that. 


I do have a car baby camera and that still didn‚Äôt prevent it. I move too quickly and get too distracted. From now on I will be putting one of my shoes back there with her and also my car keys; the car will beep loud if the keys are left in there. ",3,1757378535.0,Mommit,7,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 30 year old woman and I have just been diagnosed with autism. I was never evaluated for it as a child and it‚Äôs only recently that I started looking into the traits of autism in adult women. I was shocked by how many symptoms I was finding that I had so I scheduled an appointment with a psychologist to get evaluated. The diagnosis has brought a lot of clarity as to why I have always struggled with relationships. I have had anxiety for most of my life but I always thought there was something different about me but I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint it. I have always felt like a super sensitive person with high anxiety.

In the other areas of my life I am successful-I have 3 degrees, I own my house, I can take care of myself, I‚Äôm financially independent, I have a good career, and I‚Äôm smart. I know I am a good person and I have a lot of love to give but the stigma behind autism scares me.

I hadn‚Äôt been in a romantic relationship before or had sex yet. I know I need an emotional connection prior to sex. I am attracted to men and I do want to have sex but casual sex never appealed to me because I don‚Äôt want to be touched by someone unless I feel safe with them. (I‚Äôm not waiting for marriage just FYI) 

I have struggled with relationships my whole life and when I entered the dating scene and also tried to make friends as an adult, I was so confused by the social norms. I really tried to make connections but it often resulted in me being ghosted, ignored or overlooked.

I always felt that there was this unspoken language that people knew in the dating scene and I just didn‚Äôt know about it. Traditional dating norms have always confused me especially since I struggled to understand social cues. Places like bars, singles mixers and busy gyms overwhelm me. I even tried speed dating for a long time until eventually I got burnt out. It turns out I masked a lot when I first started dating and didn‚Äôt listen to my needs. 

I‚Äôm more interested in slower, more intimate spaces like yoga, coffee meetups, bookstores, curated meetups, discussion groups, book clubs, health and wellness groups etc. I think I want to utilize my interests and hobbies to meet friends and romantic partners.

I‚Äôm just worried that if I am on the spectrum if I can still date and find love. I‚Äôm the first person in my immediate family to receive an autism diagnosis and I‚Äôm afraid of what people will think of me and if it will limit me. Can anyone else relate or does anyone have advice on how to navigate modern dating as an autistic woman?",1,1757378479.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

### Training
This was an odd training block. I ran the Long Island Marathon in May and had a disappointing experience. The weather was challenging (low 60's with very high humidity), the course was two hilly, twisty loops, and (my bad) I went out way too fast for the conditions and my training. I decided to take another shot at a BQ time (I'm a 62M, so <3:50) on a famously fast course: the Erie Marathon on Presque Isle, Pennsylvania.

For the past year or so, I've been working with Alex Monroe at RunCoach, a program I highly recommend. For various reasons, I had to cram in several NYRR 9+1 races into August, which was not ideal from a build-up/taper perspective. Nonetheless, the folks at RunCoach helped me balance the race efforts with preparation for Erie. Over the course of the summer, my mileage was in the 25-48 mile range. I was worried it might be a bit low, but the result was definitely positive.

The only physical challenge I faced was that I developed some sciatic pain in my right leg from all the driving I did this summer. That wasn't a huge impediment to training (actually, the running made it feel better), but the lingering soreness has been uncomfortable.

One thing I've been focusing on is a more detailed approach to carbo-loading. I have carefully tracked my carbs for the 72 hours before my last two marathons and it has made a big difference.

### Pre-race
The sciatic nerve pain was definitely a factor in the lead-up to the Erie Marathon. My wife and I live in Brooklyn, which is about 7.5 hours by car from Erie. We drove out on Friday and turned it into a 10-hour trip by stopping to walk and stretch at different places along Route 80. That helped a lot, though, and I didn't feel too bad when we finally got to our B&B in Erie. There were two or three other runners staying there, which was nice.

We spent Saturday scoping out Presque Isle State Park, enjoying a narrated boat ride around the harbor, and driving around the course. Presque Isle is a beautiful location, with lovely beaches, a monument to Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, and great views of the town of Erie.

On Sunday morning, we got up at five so that I could eat my overnight oats and hydrate. We stopped at a Tim Horton's to get my wife some coffee and breakfast, and then headed over to the race parking area. As we had been warned, the traffic jam en route to the parking lot at 6:15 a.m. was impressive. When the GPS showed that we were a mile from the start line, I got out and did a slow warmup down the hill while my wife dealt with the car. I hit the portapotties one last time and then found the pacer I planned to follow.

### Race
My reach goal for this race was 3:44:30, which was exactly the time that the pacer hoped to hit (and ultimately did). I knew that it would be a stretch, but the conditions were pretty much perfect: the temp was in the low 50s, the humidity was in the high 70s and dropping, there wasn't much wind, and the course is almost completely flat.

I was able to hang with the pace group for the first half without too much difficulty, but began to lose contact at the start of the second loop. In general, I felt like I was adequately trained, and my carbo-loading helped prevent too much of a crash in the last third. I also made sure to have a Carbs gel (50g) at miles 4, 8, 12, 16, and 21. At the liquid stops, I mixed Gatorade and water, or just had water.

It became clear, however, that the 3:45 pace was a bit much at this stage of my training. I could really feel the lactic acid build-up in my legs around mile 17 or 18, and obviously slowed down over the next few miles. However, when I hit mile 24, I was pretty confident that I could break 3:50, and actually managed to accelerate through the end of the race.

My wife got some insight into the tunnel vision that marathoners develop as the end of the race approaches. She was at mile 25, and as I approached, she called my name and rang the cowbell she brought. As the video she recorded shows, I never heard a thing, even though she was less than 10 feet away. Amazing.

### Post-race
Crossing the finish line as a Boston qualifier after twenty years (2004 and 2005) was a wonderful feeling. It's slightly tempered by the reality that I probably won't get a bib for next spring, thanks to the surge in running popularity over the last few years. But it's a great step in the right direction.

My wife was waiting for me at the finish line with a banana and a big bottle of water with hydrating salts. After hobbling to the medical tent for a mylar blanket and picking up my bag of swag (more fruit, water, the race medal, and a box lunch -- chips and a turkey sub), we headed back to the car. It was a bit of a hike -- 3/4 mile up a really steep hill back to the amusement park. The walk was probably helpful, even if I was grumbling for much of it.

We had paid for a late check-out at the B&B so that I could get cleaned up. Once that was done, we loaded the car and started the long drive back to Brooklyn. Those 68 seconds made it a much happier car ride than it might have been otherwise.

I have a lot of good feelings about this race. It was very well-run, and has a great small-town vibe. Was it the last one? The race director said in her last email that she is retiring and they need some fresh faces to step up and keep it going. I hope they do; it's a unique event.

I‚Äôm not in a rush, but I‚Äôd love to find someone fun, grounded, and ready to build something strong. And yeah, long-distance isn‚Äôt my jam; so Texas ladies, you‚Äôve got home-field advantage.

You never noticed the way I looked at you, or if you did, you were unable to distinguish it from a ruse. I think you doubted my love, and my desire for you. I was the most sincere that I have allowed myself to be in years. I often would daydream about how our cozy life would be. I envisioned the combining of lives, my love extending to your babes. Taking trips, walks hand in hand, nights that felt safe and relaxing. My body entangled in yours, never having sleepless nights, those horrible bouts of hating to close my eyes. I had resolved to fight hell or high water. I thought no one had ever shown that to you, and I was going to show you different. You had asked me never to leave, never to give up, and I truly took that to heart. I knew what it felt like to have no one stand in your corner. Always standing strong, always carrying the burden for everyone. I truly knew in my gut, just by the nature of who we were, it was never going to be easy. Nothing good has ever come to me, without dedication, blood and tears. There were cracks, I felt these were going to take time and patience to fill. Trust is not granted, it is earned. We both had earning to do. I realized that mistakes, shortcomings, and old behaviors were apart of our journey. Then came the curtain call. There was never a discussion, a conversation, it was all made on your terms. The first few weeks, it did not seem real. You had me sold on buying the farm so to speak, and in an instant it was over. I understood your point of view, I understood your anger, your hurt. My old habits were making an appearance, and I have always survived, no matter what I had to do to make it happen. It was not a decision of ease, and I was truly afraid that you would not understand my reasons. That is where I fell short. You are not the only one that struggled with your ego. Mine has caused me some immense hurt, and this one shines in the spotlight. 
The ease of your decision, the coldness in your stare, made me believe that it was all a game. The gestures of forgiveness, and understanding, were only a role I would play. They did not apply to you and your behaviors. The whispers of promise and hope, began to feel like a trap to have me lower my defenses. 
You did not notice, but I was dying inside. I continued this feeling of hopelessness and agony. 
To this very day, The mention of your name, or explaining to someone why I feel lost, and defeated bring tears to my eyes, and that choke in the throat. I mope around with an overall emptiness inside. I dream and awake with a smile, only to remember that it was not real. None of it was ever real. 
I know there are many additional things to discuss. I think I‚Äôd love nothing more than a few moments of your time. To sit at ease over a cup of coffee, and just talk. I have zero desire to fight, and there are no points to be made. I loved you immensely, and I know I still do. It‚Äôs the only explanation for the never ending ache, and the smile-less expression I wear daily. I have not kept tabs on you, I do not know what path you have taken, but take heart knowing justice was served to me. Any wrongs I committed, karma came and paid me her visit. This has been one of the hardest over the cumulative last four. 
I am not sure what this lesson taught me. I do realize under the armor and tough exterior, lives a hopeless romantic, seeking for a fraction of the love and understanding I freely give. 
I hope this letter finds you well. I will not reach out, to you again. The last time I heard your voice, it held such anger and distain. I told myself that would be the last time I reached out to you. I don‚Äôt even know if you are here anymore. I also know that if you wanted to talk, you probably would have by now. I truly hope you are happy, it‚Äôs really all I ever wanted for you. I always had faith in you, even when you could not see it for yourself. I sure do miss you, and have so many things I would love to discuss and hear your opinion on. ü´∂üèº ",9,1757378062.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

The Bahrain Business Environment in 2025: Growth with a Green Edge\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain skyline and financial hub perspective., Bahrain posted a GDP growth rate of 4.7% in Q1 2025, outperforming regional peers with a surge in green technology, financial services, and logistics. The kingdom‚Äôs robust Economic Vision 2030 strategy emphasizes sustainable growth, digital government, and regulatory clarity.\
Key 2025 stats:\
- $41.2 billion GDP (Forbes/Reuters, March 2025)\
- Top 5 in the Gulf for Ease of Doing Business (Gulf News)\
- Over 98% digital government services roll-out (Sijilat, LMRA, EDB updates)\
- Green Economy Investment up 12% YoY (Reuters/Forbes analysis)\
The Bahraini government‚Äîthrough entities like Tamkeen, MOICT, EDB, and Customs‚Äîhas integrated Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) requirements directly into its licensing and regulatory frameworks since the 2023 policy update. This is not cosmetic: real incentives, shorter approval times, and even government-backed financing are now reserved for companies with a sustainability roadmap.\
Green Initiatives Supported by the Bahrain Government\
National Green Strategy and 2025 Updates\
Bahrain‚Äôs climate agenda is more than PR. In January 2025, the EDB rolled out the much-anticipated National Green Strategy 2.0‚Äîmandating waste management compliance, solar adaptation for new large offices, and sector-specific carbon emission reporting. Companies not only face stricter reporting (especially on the Sijilat portal), but also access new grants if they hit benchmarks for water efficiency, renewables, or ESG transparency.\
Key initiatives:\
- Renewable Energy Mandate: All government buildings must use at least 20% solar power by mid-2025.\
- ESG Reporting Requirements: Public and large private companies must file annual ESG statements by December 2025.\
- Green Building Certification: New construction in financial and business zones must meet green standards (consult Bahrain.com for full specs).\
- Waste-to-Energy Grants: Tamkeen‚Äôs Green Business Grant‚Äîcovers up to 25% of qualifying capex, capped at BHD 80,000, for eligible SMEs.\
\
‚ÄúSurprisingly, the ESG reporting deadlines are strictly enforced. My first year, I missed the submission by a day and had to pay a BHD 300 fine‚Äîlesson learned! Now I always prep my docs one week early with help from a local consultant.‚Äù\
\
Solar and Renewable Subsidies\
Tamkeen and the National Oil & Gas Authority jointly sponsor solar rooftop programs for small companies, offering rebates covering installation costs up to BHD 15,000 per property. Industrial firms in Salman Industrial City also benefit from electricity rate reductions if they install renewable systems.\
Water Conservation and Smart Irrigation\
Bahrain‚Äôs Water Resources Authority requires commercial developments (even mid-size ones in Seef or Diplomatic Area) to submit water-saving landscaping plans. Green office parks get a 5% property tax discount if they install government-certified smart irrigation.\
Electric Vehicle and Mobility\
As of Q2 2025, import tariffs for electric delivery and fleet vehicles have been halved. The EDB, in partnership with Gulf Air, now funds up to 30% of the upfront cost for Bahraini companies adding EVs to their logistics chains.\
Waste Management and Circular Economy\
Every company in Bahrain above 10 employees must now contract with a MOICT-approved waste disposal provider and show quarterly waste diversion rates. Tamkeen‚Äôs ‚ÄúCircular Business‚Äù scheme grants BHD 10,000 to the first 50 firms annually demonstrating closed-loop practices.\

Entity Types, Ownership, and Business Structures\
\

- BSC(c) (Closed Joint Stock Company): Required for larger fundraising rounds or IPO ambitions.\

Thanks to the 2023 Foreign Ownership Law amendments, most activities (except a handful of ‚Äúprotected‚Äù sectors) now permit 100% foreign ownership. See the list of 100% ownership activities. Bahrain is arguably the Gulf‚Äôs friendliest destination for international founders‚Äîdetails here.\
Importantly, many investors skip the step of checking allowed activities before starting registration. This gets expensive fast, as rejected Sijilat applications require resubmission and often new fees. My solution? Download the official activities list, cross-check with LMRA and Tamkeen‚Äôs current policies, and submit everything together.\

Accounting and ongoing reporting: Bahrain expects digital bookkeeping for tax, VAT, and ESG purposes. The right accounting partner saves you audit headaches.\
Free Zones: Startups in free zones enjoy simplified green compliance for the first two years, plus targeted green infrastructure incentives.\
Commercial Registration: Always match your documentation‚Äîany typo or mismatch between company name, activities, or ownership structure will delay your commercial registration.\
Local Sponsorship: Rarely required, but if pursuing a restricted activity, local sponsorship helps navigate extra green licensing hurdles.\

Bahrain Customs and Culture: The Subtle Advantage\
Ramadan adjustments matter: during the holy month, business hours are shorter but networking over traditional coffee takes on outsized importance. Don‚Äôt rush meetings; rapport is everything. Even in regulatory offices, a quick greeting (‚ÄúAs-salamu alaykum‚Äù) and patience with coffee service can open doors and ease the process.\
Majlis-style business gatherings, especially in Bahrain Bay and the Diplomatic Area, are key for local introductions. The informality belies the business potential‚Äîmany green initiative grants have ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù waiting lists, and introductions still matter.\
Brief Tangent: Why Bahraini Dates Matter (Really)\
It sounds off-topic, but stick with me. Distributing locally farmed dates during meetings‚Äîan old Bahraini custom‚Äîis now seen as a plus in ESG-minded sectors. I once landed a green finance client by showcasing our use of local, fair-trade snacks. It checked the ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù box for our ESG submission and became an ongoing conversation starter in every subsequent pitch.\
Bahrain vs. UAE/Saudi Arabia: A Green Business Perspective\
Unlike the UAE‚Äôs more segmented free zone system or Saudi Arabia‚Äôs high capital thresholds, Bahrain‚Äôs one-window Sijilat portal, freehold business property options, and transparent green grant criteria are a game changer for new ventures. The government‚Äôs proactive stance on ESG makes compliance less a headache and more a genuine business opportunity.\
But: don‚Äôt expect the process to run on autopilot. Relationships, consistency, and attention to detail are still king.\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Green Business & Company Formation\
1. Which green grants or incentives are easiest to access for startups?\
The Tamkeen Green Business Grant (up to BHD 80,000, usually 10‚Äì25% of project cost) is the fastest to access‚Äîapply in Q1 for best results. Seef District and Bahrain Bay offices are prioritized for green certification. Full details here.\
2. How do ESG requirements impact my Sijilat company registration?\
All new registrations must include a short Sustainability Statement. Missing this leads to delays or fines. Larger companies must submit annual ESG reports via the Sijilat portal. Step-by-step ESG compliance guide.\
3. What ongoing costs should I plan for green compliance?\
Budget BHD 2,000‚Äì4,500 for annual ESG filings and reporting, plus BHD 8,000‚Äì40,000 for initial upgrades (solar, water, waste). Government grants may offset 10‚Äì25%. Track major fees with this company formation cost overview.\
4. Can foreigners really own 100% of a Bahrain company in green sectors?\
Yes, except in a handful of protected industries. Most sustainability-related activities are 100% open. See current ownership allowances.\
5. What‚Äôs a common mistake in green company formation‚Äîand how can I avoid it?\
Overlooking Arabic translation accuracy. Always use Sijilat-recommended translators and cross-check every activity code in English and Arabic. Submit duplicates, pre-notarized, to avoid rework.\
\
Opinion: For serious founders looking to combine long-term profitability with strong green credentials, Bahrain stands out above its Gulf neighbours. The government‚Äôs commitment to ESG‚Äîbacked by real incentives‚Äîmakes it not only a fertile ground for sustainable business, but a genuinely rewarding place to build lasting relationships and impact.\
For specific queries or to streamline your own registration, I always recommend partnering with a knowledgeable Bahrain-based consultant who‚Äôs walked this path before. As my own story shows, insider tips (and a fresh pouch of Bahraini dates) can make all the difference.\

My mom lives a couple towns over. They are divorced nearly 20 years, but the bitter and acrimonious feelings are still strong.
 I don't have a car and my mom has been really helpful. Its nice to spend time together, running errands, grabbing coffee so I can get a break, etc.
However I knew it would only be a matter of time before something got weird.
I mentioned dad and I made a video to send to my sister and nephew (they live abroad), and suggested we make some videos too, as they loved it and turned out to be a fun way to connect.
I knew as i mentioned this i shouldnt have. It was morning, i was in a good chatty mood full of coffee just....talking too much.
Anyway she didnt react weird, all was good! I was set to borrow her car for the day, she bring it back anytime. As I headed for the door she said, ""Oh- so can I see the video?""
I said, ""No, thats ok, well make our own!"" And i left.
 I got in the car and took some deep breaths.
I felt uncomfortable, I said no, I didnt overreact, I was kind. She overstepped, and i gently corrected. This will not ruin my day, moving on.

She texted later telling me I needed to bring the car back by x time or she and her husband would be there to retrieve it. I felt the anxiety crawling all over me. Shes mad.  I said id bring car back, no problem. I did. I feared a blowout, but her husband drove us back and he never shuts up and it seems OK.

But now, its clear that im getting the silent treatment. She is not answering or returning my calls.

I am 41 years old. I feel partly like a child, anxious and panicked. What did i do?. I didnt mean to do that. Im sorry. I didnt want to cause hurt- I was just, idk,  I should have just shut up.

The other part of me sees that she is the child, wallowing in her own wounds, using me as a conduit for closure, and when j refused, condemning me. And it makes me MAD. I see the pattern of behavior. I see a lot of what we'd call emotional abuse today. I just dont have energy or space for it. Yet here I am, ruminating. Its really hard.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Austria vs. Bosnia & Herzegovina: A World Cup Qualifier Where the Odds Are Stacked Like a Jenga Tower**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a clash of perfection in Group H! Bosnia and Herzegovina and Austria both enter this September 9 showdown with unblemished qualifying records, but only one can avoid a tiebreaker that would make a spreadsheet weep. Let‚Äôs dissect this like a particularly dramatic game of chess, with humor as our knight in shining armor.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Math Meets Mayhem

The bookmakers have Austria as favorites at **-150** (decimal: **1.77**), implying a **60% chance to win**. Bosnia? A longshot at **+500** (33.3% implied probability), which is about the same odds as me correctly guessing your favorite sandwich. The draw sits at **+350** (28.6%), suggesting the market expects a tense, tactical battle‚Äîor a referee who‚Äôs secretly on a coffee break.

Austria‚Äôs edge? Their **11-point Nations League haul** (vs. Bosnia‚Äôs paltry 2) and a **7-1 goal differential** in qualifiers. Bosnia‚Äôs counterargument? They‚Äôre 3 points clear in the group and riding a **five-game unbeaten streak**, including a **6-0 San Marino romp** that makes a toddler‚Äôs art project look cohesive.

---

### News Digest: Injuries, Form, and the Eternal Struggle of Nations Leagues

Bosnia‚Äôs recent Nations League campaign was so disastrous, it could‚Äôve been used as a case study in ‚ÄúHow *Not* to Win a Group.‚Äù They finished last with 2 points, which is about as impressive as a baker claiming they ‚Äúwon the bread contest‚Äù by showing up with a baguette. Yet in qualifiers, they‚Äôve been a **goal-scoring juggernaut**, hammering San Marino 7-0 and Romania 2-1. Their home form? Unbeaten in their last two at Bilino Polje, though they last achieved three straight home wins in 2022‚Äîlong enough for their grass to grow a second layer of bling.

Austria, meanwhile, is the story of ‚ÄúAlmost, But Not Quite.‚Äù They finished second in their Nations League group (11 points!) but lost a playoff to Serbia 3-1. Still, their qualifiers have been airtight: \*\*7 goals score

I successfully tapered off of Pristiq in July. I have been fully off of the med for about 1.5 months now. Withdrawal was pretty rough but I made it. 

And now‚Ä¶ I am back to square one. I fear I am slowly slipping back into my depression‚Ä¶ my OCD is worse‚Ä¶. I can‚Äôt handle stress anymore and it‚Äôs starting to impact my job (teaching). 

I have no motivation, I‚Äôm exhausted, I don‚Äôt want to do any of my hobbies, I‚Äôm not even excited to get a coffee or anything. These are all classic symptoms of a depression episode coming on and I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ scared. 

I see a psych about ADHD potential in October. But I know I can message my primary about wanting to try a different med and I could get that filled and started in the week‚Ä¶. 

I‚Äôve been looking into wellbutrin- I briefly tried it in college for less than a month if I remember correctly. I felt wired on it so we stopped. I would be really interested to give it a shot again, but I fear I‚Äôd be giving up on myself after going through the hassle of coming off. Fluvoxamine also worked well for me but eventually came off after about 6-8 months from weight gain. 

So, how long should one wait before going back on meds? I‚Äôm eating better and I do feel relatively good overall about half of the time, but I can feel the depresso in the wind creeping up on me‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm currently upping my inositol to see if that helps as well, and take magnesium, vitamin d, vitamin b12, methylfolate once a week, flaxseed, and a good ol multi and probiotic.

I decided not to write, though. With autumn on its way, the plants that can come in need help making the transition and that is what I was working on all day. Changing out the dirt, spraying for bugs, repotting, and then finding spots for everything inside. Most of the plants will be allowed to die off and hopefully come back next spring but there are a select few we will be keeping. The citronella plants, the bird of paradises, the pineapple plant, and the rosemary's were one by one brought inside. We're about halfway done. I'll probably do the rest tomorrow but I'm going to try to write when I have time too. It'll be actually warm this week and I want to make the most of it.

My goal was mental clarity, which was achieved through a lot of trial and error.

But that got me thinking: fasting, at least for me, wasn't something I was good at right away. It took me an excessively long time just to get mildly decent at meal planning, pinpointing an optimal eating window, figuring out what I could/couldn't have during my fasting windows (turns out green tea is fine but black coffee gives me the jitters), how to deal with eating large quantities, and so on. None of this is obvious. I was really niave when I first started fasting: it's just not eating for 23 hours, how complicated can that be? Turns out, really, really complicated if you want to fast long-term and be healthy.

Omad is a skill just like any other serious practice. It takes time- a lot of time- to get good at it and figure out what you're doing. It's more than just a habit; it's constant testing, observing, experimenting, and revising. It's not always easy. Your hair can start falling out, you can feel hungry during fasting hours, you can experience indigestion, your energy levels can dip, and you can plateau. But let me be the first to say that, like with any other skill, it does get easier with diligence and time. Like playing the violin or excelling in a sport, it requires commitment to get good and see results. If you think of it that way, you may be more compassionate with yourself when you inevitably do mess up or change your style. If you're thinking of starting Omad, I recommend you view it as learning a new skill, and a difficult one at that.

1nc4fjz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nc4fjz,Massive cream bronzer/contour comparison: 64 swatches from drugstore to high-end,"Hi dear pale people,

I‚Äôve built up a pretty big makeup collection over the years - partly because I‚Äôm a MUA, partly thanks to PR, and partly because I just spend a lot of time working with makeup. I thought I‚Äôd start documenting parts of my collection, and today I‚Äôm sharing bronzers and contours.

For reference: I‚Äôm a **warm olive**. Most of the year **I‚Äôm very fair, but after summer I‚Äôm at my darkest - more light than fair.** That‚Äôs why this swatch set ranges from very cool-toned shades to quite warm ones. Some work really well on me, others not at all.

Since I‚Äôm based in **Scandinavia**, a few of these are European brands that might not be widely available elsewhere. I usually prefer green or golden undertones, since my skin doesn‚Äôt get along with anything pink, but I know many prefer those tones too. 

**A few personal favorites:**  
  
When I‚Äôm at my fairest:

* **Vieve Modern Radiance Bronzer (Light)** ‚Äî a true green undertone, never too warm, very light, creamy, and blendable + huge amount of product.
* **Fenty Beauty Cheeks Out (Amber)** ‚Äî a classic cool-toned contour, creamy and easy to work with.

When I‚Äôm in my summer shade:

* **Tanielle Jai Bronzer (Iced Latte)** ‚Äî deeper and more saturated than Vieve, but still muted/olive-leaning, with an excellent formula that isn't too creamy, therefore lasts the whole day + huge amount of product.
* **Maybelline Lifter Stix (45)** ‚Äî very similar in tone to Tanielle Jai, but creamier and more pigmented, blends like an absolute dream.

I hope this helps if you‚Äôre looking for new bronzers or contours. Feel free to ask any questions regarding any of the products!

1nc4f3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nc4f3b/aitah_for_not_always_wanting_to_invite_my_sisters/,AITAH for not always wanting to invite my sister's kids?,"Sorry for the long story but hope you enjoy it:

Hello my name is Cheryl (42F) I recently started living the single life again, i'm dating, i got back the revenge body and living life to the fullest. My three kids are already grown, only one still lives with me (23F). I've lived a baby free life for some time now so life is pretty stress free. Just coffee dates with my adult daughters without the stress of strollers, diaper bags, etc. I have a pretty social life, I go out to dinner with friends, movies, drinks, trips etc. I have 2 other sisters out of my 9 siblings. Only us females have children, our brothers have no kids and live bachelor lifestyles. My sister Charline(39F) is the best mom to her kids imaginable. New toys & gadgets, they've got them.. best clothes, they get.. trips to Disney or anywhere they ask.. they go. Some say they might be a little too spoiled but thats not for me to say because my kids are also pretty spoiled in other ways.

So my sister Charline has a little problem, if FOMO was a person she is it. She wants to get invited to girls night outs, She wants to go to every get-together my brothers hold. She wants to know everything people are up to and join. The only problem is that she's not even into any of that stuff, she hates staying out late, doesn't like to drink, my brothers are younger so she is annoyed by the younger crowds and ruckus, etc. We always consider her and invite her but the other problem is that she wants to bring her kids. Again, she's a super mom and loves having her kids with her but there is a time and place for kids.

What ends up happening is when she decides to bring her kids everything pivots to accommodate the kids. For example my brother announced his engagement and invited all of us out to celebrate in Santa Barbara. She asked if she could bring her kids and being a kind and loving family that we are, we all shrugged and said sure. Her argument was that coincidentally she already had plans to be in Santa Barbara the same weekend (lie.. there are many ""coincidences"" in most of her stories. We love her and all are already aware of these ""coincidences"" that occur quiete frequently when it comes to her kids..). so thats why she had to bring her kids. Then she loves treating our parents so on top of kids, now we have our elderly parents tagging along. This also happens a lot as well. There is a time and place when to treat and bring parents along too. So now the celebration turned into a family vacation to Santa Barbara. The plans to bar hop turned into Ice Cream shops trips. Lounging by the pool with cocktails turned into kid friendly museum tours. And dinner turned into ordering in since the kids only like pizza and chicken strips. Their gf's and friends weren't too happy with all these changes but they too know how my sister is and aren't surprised. My parents also feel like a nuisance because they are tired and didn't sign up for this, so they want to go home. My sister feels the trouble we are all going through to make her and the kids comfortable and ends up stressed out and a bit upset/overwhelmed.

To lessen the blow of kid & family activities I always volunteer to take them off my brothers hands and encourage them to continue with their plans while i tour guide my sister, kids and parents. That day in Santa Barbara she got upset with me at the end of the night because I left her and the family to join the celebration. She surprised us all by taking an uber and joining us at the bar we were at. When she walked in she gave me a dirty look and didn't talk to me as she chugged her non-alcohlic beer (no one knew it was non-alcoholic) and then i saw her switch water into the shots my new and soon to be SIL ordered. She didn't talk to me for a few weeks after that day. I just thought it was funny and I don't have any hard feelings because I didn't do anything wrong.

I have been trying to put my foot down a bit more with her but she knows the whole kid thing bothers everyone but we wont say much because we love our nieces and nephews so we would never tell them no.

Last month I had plans to celebrate my birthday with a girls brunch but again my sister asked me ""sister, you can totally say no BUT can i bring my daughter. You can say no if you want..."" I don't have the heart to tell her because its already obvious and awkward kid's don't belong there. I responeded with ""...um i guess...sure..... but you know how our girlfriends get after a few drinks, conversation isn't PG anymore..."" She changed the subject with excitement as if i said ""yes please bring my niece."" Then we had to accommodate her kid's soccer schedule and other mother errands she had for the day. At the end and per usual it didn't end up happening. My friends already know how she is and everyone was getting annoyed with all the switch arounds so i ended up canceling the entire thing. The crazy part is she doesn't even enjoy these type of activities, it's just her sever FOMO that won't let her say ""no i won't be able to make it or I rather stay home because i'm not into these things.""

The last strike was when I had 4 tickets to see a professional sports team. I ask my BIL if he thought him and my sister would like to join us. I purposely did not ask her first because I know she would accept the invitation but for her kids and not her and my BIL. He said they couldn't because he had to work and also made a remark about how he couldn't even imagine his wife agreeing to do something fun with him (& us with no kids). Then during dinner my other brother casually asked me if I had found anyone to go with me, my sister instantly perked up and said her and her son would love to join us. I couldn't disguise my face this time and i couldn't say it any other way but ""I'm sorry I thought this would be a great time for 4 adults."" Dinner was awkward the rest of the night and the past 2 weeks she hasn't really spoken to me.

My brothers are a bit more straight up with her and usually give that sort of response but this is my first time hurting her feelings like that. People and my brothers say I shouldn't care because it's sort of selfish of her to always bring me down because she wants EVERYTHING for her kids and it's not always just about them.

I'm a 36-year-old woman who lives in the Houston area, and I'm hoping to meet people with similar interests to build some meaningful friendships. I'm open to friends of any gender, but just to be clear, I‚Äôm only seeking platonic connections. I just went through a rough breakup, so I'm not looking to jump into dating. I'm working on rebuilding my life and support system at the moment. 

I'm not really into drinking or the bar/club scene anymore, so I‚Äôm a bit out of my element when it comes to meeting new people these days. I also have social anxiety, which makes it tough to initiate conversations (especially with strangers), but I‚Äôm kind, genuine, and always happy to connect once I feel comfortable.

A little about me and what I‚Äôm into:

I love reading, art (drawing & painting), photography (though I don‚Äôt currently own a camera), and DIY projects. I like walking on nature trails, gardening, city biking (I ride a road bike), thrifting, traveling, cooking and baking. My favorite movie genre is horror (but I do watch others). I like collecting and admiring oddities/curiosities, and specimens. Music is also a huge passion‚Äîespecially punk, metal, goth, garage, post-punk, etc. I love going to shows and collecting records and tapes. I‚Äôm far left on the political spectrum.

Due to chronic health conditions, I do have some physical limitations, so I‚Äôm not looking for a gym buddy or to train for marathons. But, I am always down to hang out casually, grab coffee or dinner, visit local markets or museums, go to a show, craft together, or just stroll a nature trail.

I'd like to start with messaging, graduate to texting, and then hopefully make plans to hang out in person once we're both comfortable.",1,1757376300.0,HoustonPlatonicR4R,0,1.0,False

I started buying a medium Wawa coffee with about 1/3 decaf and the rest flavored coffee in the morning and a medium Starbucks Americano 2/3 decaf in the afternoon.
I know I prob need to cut back a bit more but am struggling to figure out what else to get - any ideas?
Also, would love to be able to make coffee at home but the decaf/halfcaff I tried tasted TERRIBLE - has anyone found a decent decaf? Bonus if it comes in a K cup

Im an Aries ‚ôàÔ∏è sun, cancer ‚ôãÔ∏è moon, and Leo ‚ôåÔ∏è rising. I must say that there‚Äôs reasons opposites attract. Most energy and ladies I tend to attract in life are Virgos or to a lesser extent Capricorn and Taurus. How do Virgo women like to be flirted with? I‚Äôm over the moon with my old boss, (she no longer works with me & we‚Äôre the same age) and texting her daily has seemed to make us both express true feelings about each other. She got me to spill quite some interest and feelings I have for her, however she‚Äôs only fed me a couple things which I‚Äôll still consider a win. She‚Äôs very shelled up and not expressive, which I completely understand could be due to her previous relationships that have hurt her. I try to be witty and funny with her without overdoing it. She‚Äôll mention how something is cute and I‚Äôll immediately comeback with something cheesy like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre cute‚Äù and before giving her much time to process it I‚Äôll try to maintain her attention by talking about her hobbies or interests.  I visited her at work and took her coffee and cheesecake to show her small gestures that I‚Äôm always there for her. She‚Äôll text me that I‚Äôm the best, and again I‚Äôll rebuttal by saying something cheesy like ‚Äúhow can I be the best when you are the best? Checkmate ‚ôüÔ∏è.‚Äù I also let her bully me and express her opinions without challenging them and trying to understand her perspective. Am I doing this reasonably? I know Virgo minds love to be stimulated, but it seems like her style of texting is just short bursts and I honestly think she may have a little difficulty processing large bodies of text. I don‚Äôt mean to contradict what I just said lol, I learned to calm my energy and capabilities down to play at her level so I don‚Äôt overwhelm her. ",1,1757376027.0,virgoseason,2,1.0,False

1nc41dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1nc41dh/free_at_last_or_am_i/,Free at last! Or am I?,"My story is so similar to so many others on this subreddit. I was discarded two months ago and my expwbpd finally exited my job three days ago after working out her notice remotely from another state. 

We met through work, for ten months we were workplace besties and the love bombing was incessant. Last December we went for coffee and disclosed that we had feelings for each other. Within two weeks we had both ended our respective relationships and were a couple (my relationship was in the doldrums and she told me that hers was abusive). 

The first six months were mostly blissful as the love bombing and the sex were non stop. But the cracks were starting to show: four months in we had a week-long row about me meeting my ex for coffee (we caffeinated ). She would also test boundaries in subtle and less subtle ways via ""jokes"" and gaslighting tests. 

She had started attending online NA meetings in her home state on the advice of her therapist (who she was seeing for C-PTSD and anorexia). Come June she goes to their annual camping trip in the mountains (I declined her invite). When she comes back she puts down her luggage and tells me that she's moving out of state in two weeks and that we are done. I'm stunned but talk her out of it the next day. During the conversation she tells me that she was scared that I would dump her because her ""PTSD"" (uh...BPD) symptoms are surging and so she decided to strike first. 

For about two weeks things are okay though she's having text battles with people from the camping trip. I also start hearing a lot about a single Dad she met there who is clearly her new FP and has promised to help her find work if she moved there (they are both psychologists, as am I). With the monkey branch in place, my relationship started to unravel. She flew into a rage when I confronted her about lying to me about a concerning medical issue. She completely splits me black, moves into the spare room, and stops talking to me. When I go to talk it out I see that she has turned into someone else: her voice, mannerisms and even her face are different. The black eyes are terrifying. She's incredibly devaluing and ends by yelling obscenities in my face. This is our last ever face to face interaction. The discard happened the next day. I came home from work and her and all of her stuff were gone. 

Initially I'm relieved that I'm no longer living with a psycho, then I'm devastated that what I hoped was my next major relationship has burned to the ground. I immediately went as close to no contact as I could, only communicating by IM at work. Weirdly , she keeps messaging with my Mom. After a month I email her to confront her about her dismal behavior and to tell her that I have nothing to say to her. Her response is to tell me not to contact her outside of work. It is clear that I am now a complete non person and have been moved to the Upsidedown in her mind. About a week after I sent that email she gives her notice and moves back to her home state. This past Friday was her last day at work. 

I have no interest or intention to ever see and speak to her ever again. I really wouldn't be surprised if I were to see a news story about someone being murdered and my exwbpd being the spouse. She is obviously repeating this cycle with Mr Wonderful mentioned above. Everyone says that I dodged a massive bullet. I hope that by being so clear and setting such strong boundaries that she will get the message and never reach out. 

Have I beaten the odds??? Please let me know your thoughts. ",2,1757375994.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

1nc40rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1nc40rz/my_simple_3step_morning_routine_that_actually/,My simple 3-step morning routine that actually stuck,"I‚Äôve tried them all. The 5 AM wake-ups, the journaling, the hour-long workouts, the meditation, the cold showers... and every single ""perfect"" morning routine I ever attempted lasted for about two and a half days before I gave up and hit the snooze button 15 times.

The problem? They were all too complicated, too rigid, and honestly, too much pressure. I was trying to become a completely different person overnight, and my brain was having none of it.

So, I decided to go in the opposite direction. I gave up on ""perfect"" and started focusing on ""possible."" I built a routine so simple and so non-negotiable that my brain couldn't possibly argue with it. It‚Äôs not about being productive before the world wakes up; it‚Äôs about a small win to start the day.

This is the only routine that has ever stuck with me for more than a year:

Step 1: Hydrate Immediately
This one is literally the first thing I do. Before I even stand up, I reach for the glass of water I left on my nightstand. It‚Äôs not a full bottle, just a glass. No coffee, no phone‚Äîjust water. It‚Äôs a physical signal to my body that the day has started. It helps with that early-morning fog and makes me feel like I‚Äôve already done something good for myself.

Step 2: Move for Five Minutes
This is not a workout. I‚Äôm not breaking a sweat. I just stand up and do some basic stretching. I reach for the sky, touch my toes, roll my neck and shoulders, and maybe do a few simple yoga poses like cat-cow. It doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect or even a full five minutes. The goal is just to connect with my body, get the blood flowing, and release some of the tightness from sleeping. It's a gentle transition from stillness to motion.

Step 3: Write Down One Thing
This is my favorite part. I grab a small notebook and a pen and I write down one single task that absolutely has to get done today. Not a to-do list, not three things, just one. It could be anything from ""call the dentist"" to ""finish the report."" This simple act gives my day a quiet sense of direction without feeling overwhelming. I don‚Äôt have to worry about the other hundred things on my list; I just have to focus on that one.

This routine takes maybe 10 minutes, tops. And because it's so easy, I find myself wanting to do more‚Äîthe momentum from those three small wins often leads me to an actual workout or some journaling later. It‚Äôs the perfect launchpad for a good day.

What makes it stand out compared to other [hotels in the Quad Cities](https://www.davenportiowahotels.com) is the mix of location and amenities. You‚Äôre close to all the action in Davenport and Bettendorf, but Eldridge is quieter and less congested. That means you can enjoy a good night‚Äôs sleep while still being 10 minutes away from downtown Davenport, the Mississippi Riverfront, or even catching a show at the Vibrant Arena.

The hotel itself checks the boxes most travelers want:

* Indoor heated pool for winding down after a long drive.
* Free hot breakfast (waffles, eggs, sausage, and good coffee).
* Pet-friendly rooms, which is a lifesaver if you‚Äôre road-tripping with your dog.
* Comfortable suites that work for both families and business travelers.

I know there are plenty of **Eldridge Iowa Hotels** to choose from, but this one is part of the Choice Hotels family, so you get the reliability of a brand name while still getting that small-town hospitality feel.

If you‚Äôre planning a trip through the Quad Cities‚Äîwhether for business, a sports tournament, or just a road trip along I-80‚Äîthis hotel is worth considering. It‚Äôs a solid balance between affordability, convenience, and comfort.",1,1757375938.0,u_Davenportiowahotels,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share a project that's been a passion of mine for years, a tabletop RPG called Demayth that was actually born right here in Fargo.

The idea first started taking shape in local coffee shops like Twenty Below, and a lot of the game's energy comes from the local friends I met and the community we've been building.

Demayth is a card-based TTRPG where you play as demigods, and it's evolved into a whole universe with a new PvP board game, **Demayth: Demigod Duels**.

If you're a tabletop gamer, a board game enthusiast, or just curious about TTRPGs, we're building a local community right here in town. We even have weekly public playtesting sessions on Sundays at Paradox Comics & Cards!

We've got our own subreddit where we talk about lore, game mechanics, and share stories from our sessions. We'd love for you to join us and help make this community even stronger.

‚û°Ô∏è **Come check out our subreddit:** r/Demayth

Would love to hear from any other local gamers out there! What are you all playing these days?

Also, we welcome everyone to our sessions, and our players are willing to **pause** their gameplay to help build a character with you. Do not be shy to ask us, or jump into any session, and we also have pre-made characters as well. ",7,1757375555.0,fargo,1,0.77,False

1nc3rjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TRUE_Neville_Goddard/comments/1nc3rjz/what_are_you_aware_of_your_success_depends_on_it/,What are you aware of? Your success depends on it!,">Everyone present will hear exactly the same thing, but no two will hear it in the same depth. Some will hear it on the surface, others will hear it below the surface, and others will hear it down in the very depths of their being (‚ÄúOur Real Beliefs,‚Äù 1964).

The Law is very simple. I developed a 5-step success formula which I perfected over a number of years and it's very straightforward. I call it The Magic Five. But if I give you this formula now and you don't understand what's behind it, it does nothing for you. That's why I've spent months here first conceptualizing and breaking down the process, because without understanding not much can be obtained. And we're not done yet.

This is a very important post so read it carefully several times.

You can only be in one of two states relative to any thing or any person: a state of having or a state of wanting. The two states are incompatible and the one you are in habitually is the one that manifests.

In his books and lectures, Neville often spoke about ‚Äúcomplete acceptance.‚Äù He would say, ‚ÄúReal belief and knowing are one.‚Äù He also said, ‚ÄúA conviction is not a conviction if it can be shaken.‚Äù How do you achieve complete acceptance? In the quotation above from ‚ÄúOur Real Beliefs‚Äù Neville is essentially paraphrasing the Parable of the Sower. When the seed falls in the good ground, it bears fruit, but when it is dropped in a superficial terrain, it fails. Complete acceptance of the Law is always subconscious acceptance and that is the deep and rich soil.

You already know I tell you things as I see them not as I wish they were, because we‚Äôd be just deceiving ourselves. I‚Äôve been observing the so-called ‚Äúmanifesting community‚Äù for years. In that world, 90% will fail to accomplish their most cherished goals. Failure occurs because this thing simply doesn‚Äôt click properly, doesn‚Äôt sink deep enough. Sometimes this happens because people are too young, in other cases they‚Äôre simply not ready mentally, emotionally, spiritually, in other cases there‚Äôs a lack of discipline, or some are weak-willed, and in many cases, I suspect, they‚Äôre not serious enough and they hope to get something for nothing and their favorite Neville quote is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt lift a finger.‚Äù As Jesus put it ‚Äúmany are called, few are chosen.‚Äù

Those of you who read my posts with regularity clearly have a higher chance of success. And not simply because what I say here is more enlightened, but because what I say here is not mere fluff and feel good platitudes. If you‚Äôre serious enough about the Law to read posts of higher complexity, it means you‚Äôre more mature, more willing to go beyond empty slogans, more willing to do the work, and therefore more likely to succeed.

But in the end this thing still needs subconscious acceptance. This acceptance occurs naturally during your phase of study and experimentation. **Study is crucial because your reasoning mind cannot accept something is true unless it understands why it must be true.** Experimentation alone doesn‚Äôt help, because all you will accomplish is climbing ladders, seeing butterfly tattoos and getting free coffee. But pressing matters, the big things in life, with those you will fail, because those need complete acceptance. You need a very thorough understanding and a complete intellectual acceptance of the Law.

>Perfect understanding makes perfect faith, therefore perfect works will follow understanding. If there is very little understanding there will be very little faith, consequently imperfect demonstrations will be the result (Jane Yarnall, *Practical Healing for Mind and Body*, 1894).

If I tell you about a planet out in space, but you can‚Äôt see it with your naked eye, you won‚Äôt truly believe it‚Äôs there unless you have knowledge of astronomy. If somehow your life depends on that planet being there, you‚Äôre even less likely to believe me because you‚Äôre also very afraid. But if you study astronomy, and you understand the vastness of the cosmos and I give you a reasoned explanation for that planet along those lines, you will truly believe me. Your mind has intellectual reasons to accept why a planet is real although the eye cannot confirm its existence. Confirmation of the senses is not absolutely necessary in order for you to believe in something.

Direct interaction with an object through the senses makes the intellectual acceptance unnecessary. How many people truly understand the science behind electricity? Yet, because you have seen it work so often and you are so used to plugging in your device and seeing it work, you don‚Äôt doubt its reality. It is constantly confirmed by the senses. Well, the Law is more like the planet you don‚Äôt see, so first you must give your reasoning mind what it needs to believe and then you experiment and cement that belief into your subconscious mind. Only then you can take a big and scary project and succeed. Your belief in the Law is so strong it supersedes all fear. Even if my life depends on it, if I plug the life-saving device in the power outlet I don‚Äôt really fear it won‚Äôt work, because my faith in electricity is that strong.

**The three things you need to succeed.**

**1.** Train your mind to accept the existence of two dimensions in which it can operate. The first is the 3D dimension and the second is the 4D dimension. The first is the realm of effect while the second is the realm of cause. The first is governed by time, space and motion, the second is a timeless state of eternal being. The first consists of conditioned events related to each other in succession, the second consists of items fully independent of each other and unconditioned. Read my Troward series every week and you‚Äôll learn more about this subject.

You must habituate your mind to move consciously from 3D to 4D and to understand and accept what those dimensions are about. Crucially your mind must accept without reservation that the 4D is the spiritual world of Cause and the 3D is the material world of Effects. *Therefore, an effect cannot generate another effect unless you‚Äôre transferring that effect to the 4D and declare it a cause.* That‚Äôs how people perpetuate unhappy states in their life. They take an Effect (zero dollars in the bank account) and turn it into a Causal state of being (I am poor) and therefore their unconscious operation in the 4D is merely a restating of what they see in the world of effects.

The key is to place in the 4D mental images at your own discretion, unrelated to current conditions in the 3D. You can do that with confidence and detachment only if you understand the operation of the two worlds.

**2.** What are you aware of? The following story circulated in the early New Thought movement and many authors repeated it in their books as an illustration of the point I‚Äôm making here. There was this hospital full of invalids paralyzed in bed and the building caught fire. In complete shock, many patients jumped out of bed and some jumped out the window to save their lives. They became so focused on the fire, they forgot all about their infirmities. The shock completely blocked their awareness of paralysis and their mind became so concentrated, so one-pointed on the issue of survival and escaping the fire, their body responded.

**The image you projected in the 4D must become your mental identity.** You must identify with that image of yourself, with that image of the conditions you wish to experience in your life. That image has reality in the eternal present. It‚Äôs not in the 3D yet and it‚Äôs silly to declare ‚ÄúI have it now‚Äù and then you proceed to ‚Äúignore the 3D‚Äù which is essentially living in delusion. If you truly understand #1 above to the point of complete acceptance, it means your mind can clearly distinguish between 4D and 3D. What you need to do is to remain loyal to the 4D projection in full confidence that it will materialize if you give it the time it needs.

Your awareness of being and your daily activities are separate things if you truly trained your mind to think in two dimensions. I can have bills stacked on the desk and yet have the awareness of abundance because they are simply separate dimensions. Crucially I also know that bills do not have the power of causality. Of course I need to take care of them presently and I work diligently in the 3D world until some opportunity shows itself and means I could not devise present themselves and slowly but surely on this Bridge of Incidents I see my 4D projection being transferred into my 3D world.

**3.** What Neville called persistence is a form of loyalty to your imaginal act. You should contemplate that image often - ‚Äúfill your mind with imagination‚Äù - as Neville used to say. Most people in his success stories would imagine their wish fulfilled in bed every night. The effect of this routine is to keep your awareness fixed on the 4D creation, to identify with it mentally and emotionally. This is particularly important in pressing matters when there‚Äôs strong 3D anxiety.

All this can be seen by reverse engineering the process in this fictional dialogue:

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† What are you aware of?

I‚Äôm aware of my wish being fulfilled, of being the person I want to be and having the things I want to have.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† What makes you aware of it and how do you remain aware of it?

I‚Äôm aware of it and can remain in that awareness because I understand the operation of the 4D dimension in relation to the 3D dimension and I understand the cause & effect relationship between them.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† What makes you think all of that is even real?

I believe it is real because I have studied the Law. I understand and accept the rationale behind it and find it convincing. I have also heard of its practical application from people I respect and trust, like Neville and his students, the owner of this sub, and others.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† What is your current state?

Because of the knowledge I accumulated, I decided to try it with confidence and I am now expecting a result.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† What do you do if doubts creep in?

I remind myself of all the reasons I accepted the reality of the Law in the first place.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† What happens if you succeed?

My belief in the Law becomes unshakable.

**Every day go back mentally to the three points I‚Äôm making here today. Rehearse their logic in your mind. Know that it is working, whether you see it or not. Know that your imaginal seed will absolutely grow and bear fruit if you identify with that result, if you go to the end and identify with that end.**

Ask yourself that question as often as you can during the day: ‚ÄúWhat are you aware of?‚Äù and place your awareness again on the wish fulfilled and become conscious of its reality. If you catch yourself analyzing events, or evaluating scenarios, or calculating odds, stop it and say ‚ÄúDo not rationalize it‚Äù and then again ‚ÄúWhat are you aware of?‚Äù and place your attention back on the wish fulfilled. You‚Äôll see that eventually your awareness of the wish fulfilled will become a more natural state. Neville talks about all these things in his lectures.

>Your world forever conforms to your inner assumption. Remember your aim a thousand times in the course of a day. Notice your thoughts in regard to it, and break all unlovely ones. If you are not successful, it is because you not practicing this truth and applying this law (‚ÄúThe Human Spirit,‚Äù 1952).

>Assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled and learn to become intensely aware of the state fulfilled, that you may look upon your world and describe it relative to your fulfilled desire. And learn then to sustain that mood. You will find in time through the habitual motion of your inner you, after a little while, because it always travels according to habit, it will move through habit into the feeling of the wish fulfilled, and the moment it is a natural wearing to itself, it starts to change the outer world to reflect the inner change of your mind (‚ÄúThe Power of Awareness,‚Äù 1953).

There‚Äôs nothing esoteric or magical about any of this. There‚Äôs no room for superstition here, angel numbers, signs and other nonsense. You‚Äôre simply applying a principle. Any Law has rules and you must follow them if you want to succeed.

In traditional religion, everything I said today is communicated like this: ‚Äúalways pray with confidence and know that our benevolent Father (4D) loves us and hears us and wants to give us everything we need (3D).‚Äù And Jesus said ‚Äúanything you want (3D), when you pray (4D), believe you have already received it and you will have it.‚Äù The Indian Upanishad said ‚ÄúHe who worships the Kingdom of Self (4D) does that which is never exhausted; whatever he wants (3D), he gets for himself.‚Äù

My mind and your mind may work differently. Take the route that feels more natural to you. No matter what route you take it must lead deep into your subconscious mind where your true convictions are stored. If it doesn‚Äôt, you‚Äôll keep wandering aimlessly from sub to sub, video to video, looking for the next success story to drop for your dopamine boost, but that‚Äôs like the seed that fell on the road and the birds ate it. It never grows deep roots.

>Man must know that his awareness of being is God. Until this is firmly established so that no suggestion or argument of others can shake him, he will find himself returning to the slavery of his former belief. He will continue seeking the cause of his confusion in the world of effects and so shall die in his fruitless search (*Your Faith Is Your Fortune*, 1941).",9,1757375275.0,TRUE_Neville_Goddard,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been stuck in ruts before, but this just feels like I‚Äôm incapable of climbing out of this one. I feel so angry, mostly at myself, but it‚Äôs been directed towards the people I love too. 

I recently ended a long-term friendship over some issues that probably could‚Äôve been fixed (not seeing each other in over two years when she visited my state all the time), but I was feeling so mentally drained and resentful that I gave it up. I essentially told her we had just drifted apart as friends and needed to call it quits. We haven‚Äôt spoken a word to each other since that text conversation, a friendship I had had for almost 10 years. I keep all friendships at an arms length now because I‚Äôm terrified of losing anymore friendships. I rarely hangout with the few friends I‚Äôve managed to keep. I‚Äôm fearful they‚Äôll see how boring and depressing I am to be around now, so I keep myself busy with work and do things by myself or only spend time with a few of my family members.

A little over a year ago, I had to move back to my home state of Florida after living in my dream city of Denver for years after college. I just couldn‚Äôt make it work financially anymore, and I feel like I‚Äôm a shell of who I used to be out in Colorado. I would constantly go out by myself or with friends to events, concerts, coffee shops, go on dates, meet new people, everything! It felt like having to give up my biggest dream I‚Äôve ever had and it shattered a part of me to have to move to somewhere I said I would never go back to. I‚Äôm living in an area of Florida with a much older demographic of people (basically an area where people go to retire and golf ugh), so it makes sense there‚Äôs not as much ‚Äúyoung people‚Äù things to do. However, even when I do see fun events come up, I find myself not even wanting to go to them. I feel self-conscious and uncomfortable going out in public nowadays, wanting to hide away at home whenever possible. 

I‚Äôm working what I would consider to be my dream job now (self-employed pet sitter), but I feel anxious all the time and want to give it up. I have an autoimmune disorder that can flare up and cause me some major arthritis pain, and those issues are slowly creeping back after years of not having any major issues. I can‚Äôt do my job as well as I‚Äôd like to and I‚Äôm having to take pain relievers and ice myself constantly just to be able to do any kind of physical activity. I eat healthy food, exercise regularly, and recently lost about 30 pounds in the hopes I could alleviate some of these issues‚Ä¶.. but I‚Äôm still feeling like crap mentally and physically. I‚Äôm living paycheck to paycheck with this job at this point, so I‚Äôm still having to force myself through my physical discomfort just to keep my bills paid. 

I‚Äôm diagnosed with OCD, MDD, ADHD, GAD, and all of the eating disorders. I‚Äôve been off and on so many different medications to help with these issues, but now I‚Äôm not on anything as of about 9 months ago. Before anyone asks, these emotions and feelings had started before I had quit any of these medications. I felt so numb after being on antidepressants, adderall, and anti anxiety medication for years. But maybe I should just suck it up and accept the numbness of medications instead of feeling like a shell of who I used to be? All I do is ruminate over younger, happier versions of myself and life just seems pointless moving forward. I‚Äôve gone in an out of overindulging in weed and/or alcohol to cope, but I‚Äôm not even finding joy in partaking in those habits anymore, so I rarely indulge in either. 

How do I find the will to keep moving forward with life? How do I get out of this rut? I try to see the silver lining in all the bad, but all I can see is that I‚Äôm a failure and it makes me hate myself even more. Please help me. 


TLDR: I‚Äôm a 27 year old woman with very few friends, dealing with mental and physical pain, living paycheck to paycheck, living in a state I don‚Äôt like, and finding it hard to see a reason to keep moving forward after fulfilling or failing all my life goals and aspirations.

After spraying on my skin(one in the morning and one in the evening) and letting it settle for 3 hours, here is my final review.

Morning: Harvest Mouse

What it smells like:
It‚Äôs late September and you‚Äôre at your local cider mill. You are surrounded by corn fields and hay bails.  The sun grants some warmth in combination with your cozy flannel. There are others laughing nearby, sipping on beer and indulging in desserts.

My opinion: 
Harvest Mouse starts off with a woody orange scent. The dry down turns into a cozy vanilla with a hint of that beer/hay smell. If you are looking for a cozy scent that transports you to autumn, this would be it. To me, it is not super sweet. It‚Äôs a woody warm vanilla. I enjoy it, but I don‚Äôt usually go for a woody vanilla.

BF‚Äôs opinion: 
Reminds him of a coffee house that bakes their own baked goods. He likes it.

Would we wear it: I would wear it
Would I buy it: I would consider a travel size
Rated: 8.4/10

Evening: Camel

What it smells like:
You‚Äôre walking downtown notice a store with some beautiful crystals inside the window. You walk inside and are hit with the smell of incense and cinnamon sticks. Sun-catchers illuminate the store with patterns glimmering over an array of crystals, furs, tea, and herbs.

My opinion:
If you like the smell of incense, you‚Äôll love Camel. It gives hippie, spiritual, earthy, spice. There is also a musky animalistic scent that accompanies it that is quite unique. I enjoy the smell but I wouldn‚Äôt wear it. 

BF‚Äôs opinion: 
Him: ‚Äúsmells like Khol‚Äôs‚Äù
Me: ‚Äúlike the department store?‚Äù
Him: ‚Äúyea that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting‚Äù

Yung dalawang kapatid ko may kotse pero pag nanghihiram ako or nagpapahatid nag-aambag ako. Walang palya. Lagi akong nagbibigay. Unless sabihin nila na wag na, matagal tagal pa na pilitan para lang di ako magbigay.

Nitong nakaraan, may kailangan akong lakarin. Nalaman ng kapatid ko, sabi nya samahan nya daw ako. Sabi ko wag na dahil kaya ko naman magcommute. Mas gusto ko actually magcommute. Pero naginsist sya, libre naman daw sya. Para daw di na ako mahirapan. Sweet. Ako si shonga pumayag ako tapos natouch pa ako kasi may hatid sundo ako sa araw na yun. 

Nasa mall na kami, nilibre ko sya ng food at coffee habang naghihintay para saken. Cute namin parang close na close uli kasi may pamilya na ako kaya ngayon lang uli nakalabas.

Ganiyan naman kasi kalakaran sa mga kapatid ko, pag nagkaron ka kasi ng utang na loob, mabilis nilang sinusumbat. Kaya ako, laging may pakunswelo at baka may masabi pa. 

Fast forward ngayon, biglang may babayaran pala ako sa kanya. Yung hinatid sundo nya daw ako sa mall. Ahh. Kagigil. Kung alam ko lang nasisingilin nya ako, di na ako pumayag.

Pero sya kasi naginsist kaya akala ko love nya lang ako at libre naman sya kaya why not. Sinendan ko na ng pera. Nainis ako kasi nakabudget din naman ang pera ko. Sya nag-aya eh. Sana antemano sinabi nya na may bayad para napagisipan ko. Unang una wala naman problema sakin magcommute. Pakiramdam ko nascam ako eh.

Washer says a cycle takes 30 minutes, but experience has suggested the 30 minutes start after the initial water fill is complete, and does NOT factor in the option for ‚Äúextra rinse‚Äù. Dryer cycle is 45 minutes and comes equipped with a countdown timer. 

Serendipitous timing, I enter the laundry room as someone has just emptied the washer and turned on the dryer (it still shows 45 minutes). 

I throw in laundry, walk away while it‚Äôs filling and set my timer for exactly 30 minutes because I‚Äôm tired and forgot to account for the dryer being in use. I actually return 35 minutes after I left, figure I‚Äôll put my next load of (non-dryer) laundry down and get myself a cup of coffee from the beverage station. 

My laundry is already on the table. By my timer the washer finished LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES AGO and this guy has already taken it out. There‚Äôs still 4 minutes on the dryer. 

He loiters by the washer while I politely bite my tongue and wait for the dryer to finish, because after that stunt no way am I leaving ANY of my stuff unattended near him. And then, AS SOON AS the dryer stops, he gestures at me. 

I gave him a dead fish stare, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs usually courtesy to wait a few minutes before you move someone‚Äôs stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I waited a few minutes.‚Äù For my clothes to be on the table and his to already be in the machine, he waited maybe 1-2 minutes. And given his gesture within 5 SECONDS of the dryer stopping? Nope, not giving him the benefit of the doubt.  

I waited a full 10 minutes, hoping the owner of the dryer laundry would return so I could model polite behavior but no luck. I moved their laundry, put my stuff in the dryer, went by the front desk for my coffee and a spare tissue box, and then as the elevator doors were closing, I saw a woman walk by who I suspect was the owner of the dryer laundry (having previously seen her walking away while I was on my way to the laundry room).

I hate the creams I feel like they do nothing just make it spread. I always ice at the first tingle as well. 
Can anyone else offer any tips. I‚Äôm really struggling with my everyday life when I get them.

But I watched her die.

Now they‚Äôre coming for me.

I might already be gone by the time you read this, but it doesn‚Äôt matter, I need to tell you the truth.


Cambria and I met during freshman orientation at Forester University, both pretending not to be scared.

She wore a Misfits shirt four sizes too big and duct tape around her boots ‚Äî not for style, but to ‚Äúhold the nightmares in‚Äù according to her.

We bonded over cheap coffee, obscure metal bands, and our mutual hatred of small talk.

Most nights we would put on some music and do our best impression of being rockstars or stay up late and watch horror movies together.

She and I would take turns reading Lovecraft and Ligotti stories in a deadpan British accent to see who could make others laugh the hardest before bed. 

Cambria wasn‚Äôt just my best friend; she was the only person who ever made me feel like I mattered. So, when she disappeared, I knew something was horribly wrong.


The university claimed she‚Äôd gone home for a ‚Äúfamily emergency‚Äù but the problem with that excuse was that Cambria didn‚Äôt have a family. 

She had no parents, no siblings‚Ä¶only me.

I called, I texted, and I even emailed her professors, but nothing ever came of it. 

Her student email? 

Gone. 

The login screen just said: ‚ÄúUser not found.‚Äù

When I checked her dorm, someone else was living there ‚Äî a girl who insisted she‚Äôd been there the whole semester.

I went to campus police, but they told me that if she went home due to a ‚Äúfamily emergency‚Äù, there was no point in investigating. 

No one seemed to be that bothered by her disappearance and what was once hot gossip on university campus eventually quieted.

It was like she‚Äôd been surgically removed from the world ‚Äî and my memory was next.


One night, I lay in bed, rereading the last text Cambria ever sent me repeatedly:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking into something I found here on campus. I‚Äôm going under to fight it. If something happens to me don‚Äôt go looking.‚Äù

Was this about the sleep study she talked about signing up for on campus? I remembered her telling me about it once.

‚ÄúI thought maybe they could help me shut the nightmares out for good.‚Äù Was her reasoning for participating.

We used to joke about our sleep paralysis demons like they were nothing more than late-night hallucinations.

But now? I‚Äôm not so sure.


A few weeks after she vanished, I saw them walk for the first time.

I remember waking up to the sounds of beds creaking ‚Äî one after another, slowly.

All down the hallway in sync.

Confused, I crept to my door quietly and cracked it open to see students filing out of their rooms ‚Äî maybe fifteen, maybe twenty ‚Äî moving in complete silence.

Their eyes were half-lidded; arms limp at their sides. They had that eerie weightlessness you see in the movements of sleepwalkers ‚Äî like the body‚Äôs running on instinct instead of thought.

Their footsteps clacked in a soft, dragging hush across the linoleum as I tried to process what exactly I was witnessing.

Jenny, one of the girls from down the hall, passed my door. 

Her lips moved, barely audible.

‚ÄúVel-kirash...‚Äù

It sounded like a breathy, nonsensical syllable‚Ä¶not like a word.

I wanted to step out and speak but I stood frozen in the dark, watching them walk in unison down the stairs until they disappeared into the dark‚Ä¶


The next morning, it was just like any other day on campus.

I casually asked around to see if I could get a better understanding of what I saw.

‚ÄúDid you have any weird dreams last night?‚Äù

I received blank stares, a few laughs, and a lot of questionable looks.

No one seemed to remember anything about the events of that night.

Everyone seemed to think I was the crazy one.

However, I did receive a lead from a random person on campus who told me to check out the campus sleep study. It was apparently Forester‚Äôs ‚Äúbest-kept secret‚Äù.


I searched the university archives and found the sleep study ‚Äî sort of.

I found it tucked away under an archived projects folder in the psychology department. It was called, ‚ÄúThe S.S.M. Protocol ‚Äî ‚ÄúSleep State Manipulation.‚Äù and it was supposedly terminated two years ago.

There were no names of any participants listed, but the folder was labeled ‚ÄúGroup C.‚Äù 

I couldn‚Äôt shake the thought ‚Äî C for Cambria?

The only name tied to the project was Dr. Isaac Trenholm, one of Cambria‚Äôs professors. 

His faculty page was gone.

The only result I could find was an old PDF titled: ‚ÄúOn Induced Conscious Dissonance During REM Cycles.‚Äù

It was forty pages of dense medical jargon, but one paragraph stood out:

‚ÄúIn a guided hypnagogic state, the mind can be gently urged with the word ‚ÄúVel-kirash‚Äù (translation: to hollow the vessel so the womb may be filled) to accommodate a second tenant. Dream entities cannot enter the waking world unless the mind is first emptied as it is only dangerous when paired with autonomy. A lucid mind can be a prison ‚Äî or a doorway. We are simply‚Ä¶ opening the door.‚Äú

There was that word again.

Vel-kirash. 

What was Dr. Trenholm talking about? What was he hoping to accomplish with this?

I thought about the text messages Cambria sent me and how she could have known something was wrong with the sleep study. 

I think she volunteered to go under ‚Äî thinking she could resist whatever it was they were doing.

She didn‚Äôt just fall into this, she tried to stop it, but it cost her everything.


That night, at 2:33 am, the beds creaked in a dreadful domino-like rhythm as the students got out of bed and began walking.

Instead of watching, I followed closely behind this time.

The procession moved past the quad toward the faculty buildings, their bare feet slapping softly against the pavement. 

My heart pounded as I mimicked their pace behind a tall boy from my statistics class. 

His head lolled slightly as he walked, his jaw slack as he whispered under his breath:

‚ÄúVel-kirash‚Ä¶vel-kirash‚Ä¶‚Äù

They stopped at a locked maintenance gate on the east side of campus. A student stepped forward and pressed her palm flat against the metal. The lock slid open, the gate opened, and they walked inside.

I froze at the entrance,  the air seeping out was sour and carried a faint chemical sting that burned my nostrils.

One of the students turned her head towards me. Not all the way ‚Äî just enough that her half-lidded eyes brushed over me. 

For the first time, I thought I saw recognition flicker there. 

‚ÄúVel‚Ä¶‚Äù she breathed.

My pulse spiked as I stepped back too quickly. I panicked and tripped over my own foot, the sound echoed, causing every head in the group to turn at once.

Their eyes glinted in the dim lamplight; dozens of slack faces locked onto me.

I bolted, my footsteps thudding across the concrete as I ran. 

Behind me, their murmurs swelled into a chorus of chanting. 

It chased me across the quad, growing louder even though I didn‚Äôt dare look back.

By the time I reached my dorm, the chanting had stopped ‚Äî but I didn‚Äôt dare close my eyes.

I never took my eyes off the hallway the rest of the night.


I saw them walk three times before I followed. 

I told myself I was gathering information, but really, I was just afraid. 
 
I wasn‚Äôt ready to go where she went, not yet.

However, my mind was made up.

The longer I waited, the more I felt her slipping away, like the world was actively forgetting her.

I was terrified that if I waited too long, I wouldn‚Äôt even remember who I was trying to save.

That‚Äôs what motivated me to practice in my room until I could mimic the limp limbs and shallow breathing of the unconscious mind.

I practiced in the mirror, swaying with my eyes cracked just enough to see ‚Äî until I couldn‚Äôt tell where pretending ended and becoming something hollow began.


At exactly 2:33 a.m., when they rose from their beds to sleepwalk, I slipped into the already full hallway and joined them.

No one looked at me.

We moved together, barefoot ‚Äî a slow procession of blank faces through the dark.

Outside the campus, the air was dense like underwater pressure.

The lamplight didn‚Äôt stretch as far as it should‚Äôve across the quad as we passed the fountain toward the old biology lab.

Its windows were boarded, and chains were wrapped around the doors where a ‚ÄúDO NOT ENTER‚Äù sign hung crooked, the red ink sun-bleached into pink.

One of the students in the front of the pack reached out and touched the chain.

There was no rattling, no snapping, it simply fell apart, causing the doors to swing open on their own.

Inside, we passed through narrow, decaying corridor as the doors shut behind us.

Fluorescent lights hummed and flickered overhead. One buzzed so violently it blew out ‚Äî and stayed dark for a full minute.

In that darkness, I felt the breath of one the students upon my neck.

When the light returned, the hallway was unchanged, but I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking.

Symbols covered the walls ‚Äî spirals, slashes, intersecting circles. 
 
One had been scratched out violently, gouged deep into the plaster.

Then came the stairs.

A narrow, concrete stairwell slick with condensation and no railings led us down.

Every step echoed like we were walking inside a throat

A flickering light above us died again, and in that moment of darkness, I heard a voice echo faintly from inside the pipes:

‚ÄúVel-kirash...‚Äù

The syllables bounced off the walls strangely. It was as if they were being spoken in reverse.

When the light came back, everyone kept walking.

No one reacted.

The walls shifted gradually from cinderblock to smooth, cold stone as we traversed across the uneven floors.

And then...we reached the lab.

Or maybe it was never just a lab.

At the center of the room was Cambria, her breath ragged. In front of her stood Dr. Isaac Trenholm, chanting in a language that felt older than words.

She wasn‚Äôt strapped down; she chose to be there.

Maybe she thought if she gave herself willingly, she could stop it from taking someone else.

But she wasn‚Äôt winning.

Whatever she‚Äôd hoped to fight‚Ä¶ was winning.

The others stood with eyes closed, chanting ‚Äî not watching but feeding it. 
 
Each word tightened the noose around her heart.

The carved symbols on the walls pulsed faintly, glowing a sickly green in time with the chants.

The thing inside Cambria was not merely emerging ‚Äî it was consuming her from within.

Her lungs convulsed. 

Something slithered beneath the skin of her ribcage, coiling and uncoiled like a worm as it pressed against her heart.

Spider silk like tendrils entwined with her blood vessels, siphoning the life from her body as she twitched involuntarily.

I watched through squinted eyes as her muscles spasmed in a desperate attempt to let out a scream that she couldn‚Äôt. 

She silently mouthed a desperate ‚Äúhelp me‚Äù from her cracked lips.

I wanted to cry out her name and tell her I was there but instead, I watched in horror.

Her eyelids fluttered in anguish as something tore free.

Dr. Trenholm staggered forward as the cracking of Cambria‚Äôs skull filled the chamber, his face shining with sweat. 

His lips trembled with joy as if he were watching a miracle being performed. 

His hands shook not with fear but anticipation as the creature, slick with afterbirth, tore itself free.

Trenholm exhaled a sigh of relief as it emerged from her skull, its skin thin, translucent, and showing twitching veins.

Tears dripped from the corners of her eyes and down her cheeks as its limbs moved in all the wrong ways, jerking violently.

Her fingers twitched and curled into a fist, then opened like a flower wilting in fast-forward.

For a second, her eyes cleared ‚Äî no longer glassy but wet with terror. 

She looked at me, mouthed my name ‚Äî and for a moment, she was there. 

Then she was gone.

The creature‚Äôs mouth twisted into a terrible imitation of a smile, but it wasn‚Äôt a face built for warmth.

And then, a barely audible whisper:

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wake up...‚Äù

The words pierced me, a desperate plea, and a warning all at once.

The creature‚Äôs head snapped toward me with impossible speed.

Its vacant, half-formed eyes locked onto mine, and I felt a cold click inside my chest.

I couldn‚Äôt stop the scream.

‚ÄúGet her!‚Äù Dr. Trenholm commanded, pointing at me.

I didn‚Äôt think, I just ran as fast as I could.

I sprinted through the dark, lungs burning, the air thick with blood and chemicals.  

Claws scraped against concrete behind me, gouging deep into the walls.  

Emergency lights flickered, casting warped shadows as I ran.

My chest tightened as the sound of footsteps dragging softly but deliberately just out of sight grew louder behind me.

All the students from earlier‚Ä¶they were hunting me as well.

I could hear the creature‚Äôs movements close behind. 

I turned to see its limbs dragging and then snapping forward unnaturally fast like watching stop-motion in real time.

It let out a wet, gurgling rattle as it pounced, its ice-cold claws grazed my shoulder.

I twisted away, my shirt ripping as I felt warm blood drip down my back.

The students were practically breathing down my neck but the adrenaline coursing through me wouldn‚Äôt let me stop.

A door ahead shimmered faintly and desperation made me sprint for it with everything I had. 

I slammed into it with all my weight and finally burst out into the cold night air. 

I kept running beneath flickering streetlamps that buzzed and sputtered like they were dying. 

Every step I took felt heavier, the world around me tilting just slightly off balance.

My heart hammered like a frantic drum as I collapsed onto the cracked sidewalk, gasping for air as I dared to look back. 

The building loomed behind me, its boarded windows like dead eyes.

Somewhere inside, the creature still waited.

I know the truth.

I know what I saw.

I never went back, and I‚Äôve been running ever since.

I found her‚Ä¶and I failed her.

I wonder if she was still in there.

If her last feeling was pain‚Ä¶ or if she was already gone ‚Äî carved out, emptied like a house no one remembers living in.


I‚Äôm at a bus station, three states away.

I swear I hear the faint shuffle of bare feet against tile.

My friends say they don‚Äôt remember me. 

Not just Cambria ‚Äî me. 

One of them even asked who I was before hanging up.

Last night, at the motel I stayed at, I thought I saw someone standing across the street watching me.

I shut the blinds, locked the door, wedged a chair under the knob‚Ä¶and still, I heard it. 

At 2:33 a.m., a harsh whisper through the vent: ‚ÄòVel-kirash.‚Äô

I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can run before they take me back underground, before I forget why I was running at all.

If you‚Äôve ever dreamed of stairs that only go down ‚Äî don‚Äôt follow.

Please. 

For me. 

For Cambria.

I bought a Flair 58+2 a month ago and have been enjoying making excellent coffee with it. However, it has very quickly become extremely loose in the plunger/pressure gauge area to the point where it is already affecting the operation of the machine.

It's so loose that the plunger arm can start dropping the plunger without any pressure. So, by the time you have a little 2-bar pre-infuse you are halfway down the plunge. It was not like this to begin with. 

VERGIL from Flair wrote back to me saying this is normal. In fact, Vergil from Flair was straight up RUDE and unhelpful. That's how you lose repeat customers Flair. Customer service is important. 

I've been making espresso at home for years and know what I am doing. I've made the best coffee I've had using this Flair. It's not user error OR an unhappy customer looking for a refund - I just want my $1200 machine to work properly and to last.

Where your help comes in - can any Flair 58+2 users please drop me a quick video of the play in your Flair to see if mine is in fact ""normal""? Remember this was brand new 1-month ago (has made about 10 coffees per week).

You‚Äôre saying people are out here getting paid real CASH just to click on CAPTCHAS‚Ä¶? Like those ‚Äúselect the crosswalk‚Äù grids I do when signing into random sites? ü§Ø

Okay, either I‚Äôve lost my mind or the internet has a twisted sense of humor, because today I stumbled into the wild, wacky world of ‚ÄúApp Testing Gateways.‚Äù And friends, what I found absolutely BROKE my brain. 

Let me spell out what I saw:

- ***Go to this site: https://goodnovel.org/testapp (YES, that link ‚Äì more on that below)***
- Complete an app download/test
- BAM! Suddenly you‚Äôre supposed to get ~ PAID ~ just for proving you‚Äôre not a robot????

Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîI love a side hustle. Who doesn‚Äôt want some pocket change for minimal effort? So I dug into this rabbit hole, clicking and tapping till my thumbs fell off.

Here‚Äôs what I discovered, and y'all‚Ä¶ prepare yourselves:

- 60% of these so-called ‚ÄúGet Paid to Click Captchas‚Äù schemes are just there to rake in traffic and ad revenue. YOU are the product. 
- I saw a ton of comments: ‚ÄúI never got paid!‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt just made me download 3 weird apps!‚Äù OOF.
- That ***https://goodnovel.org/testapp*** link? It keeps popping up everywhere. Everybody swears by it, most sound either desperate or wildly optimistic about cashing out, but‚Ä¶ how legit is it?

So, naturally, I had to try myself (don‚Äôt judge me). Downloaded an app via the ***https://goodnovel.org/testapp*** gateway, clicked about 9,000 captchas until I memorized every traffic light ever constructed, then waited.

WAITED.

Nothing.

But then, after two days, something moved. A digital reward‚Äîa voucher‚Äîappeared. It was small, but, GUYS, it was real. I could literally cash out for a coffee.

Now, here‚Äôs the real TRUTH:  
- These app testing gateways might pay, but you usually have to jump through some STUPID hoops first. Like, ""watch ads, download sketchy apps, click even MORE captchas.""
- Sometimes, they move the goal post *right* as you‚Äôre about to cash out: suddenly you need higher points or ‚Äúcomplete more tasks.‚Äù
- The ones like ***https://goodnovel.org/testapp*** are everywhere, and while they *can* pay out, it‚Äôs NOT as easy as they make it sound.

Bottom line? The whole ‚Äúget paid to solve captchas‚Äù universe is NOT the goldmine you might have dreamed. Is it possible to snag a Starbucks on a bored afternoon? Sure. Are you going to pay your rent with this? LET'S BE REAL‚Äîabsolutely not.

- Expect tiny payouts
- Prepare for lots of time wasted
- And absolutely DON‚ÄôT give anyone your primary info‚Äî create a throwaway email/account

I'm shocked at the level the hustle has reached‚Äîentire sites based on ***https://goodnovel.org/testapp*** and its clones! Maybe I‚Äôm just old or out of touch, but if you told 13-year-old me in a computer lab that clicking on bridges could buy me coffee‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd probably believe you. 

Tell me‚Äîam I missing something? Anyone actually made serious money here, or am I lost in some captcha-fueled fever dream? Let‚Äôs talk! And, if you DO check it out (especially that ***https://goodnovel.org/testapp*** link‚Ä¶), PLEASE report back.",1,1757374139.0,AIpoweredInfluencer,0,1.0,False

You know those moments where you‚Äôre not even looking for a ""hot product,"" but suddenly one stares you right in the face and you can‚Äôt stop clicking? Yeah, that happened today.  

I came across this device, and at first, I couldn‚Äôt even decide if it‚Äôs medical, futuristic, or just plain wild. But the details kind of blew me away and now I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I mean‚Ä¶ who *knew* mobility solutions could actually feel like discovering cool tech?

Here‚Äôs the ""hot product"" I stumbled onto:

**Top On Sale Product Recommendations!**  
Ankle Fracture Fixation, Night Use, Daily Walking Brace, Foot Drop Fracture Fixation Support and Fixator  
Price Now: USD 48.79 (Original price: USD 57.40, 15% off)  
üîóClick & Buy: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ompIzT7  

And yet, here‚Äôs where my brain went:  

- First thought: wait, this *fixates fractures* while also being wearable for night use?  
- Second thought: how is something that sounds this technical suddenly priced like an everyday purchase?  
- Third thought: okay, does this mean we‚Äôre at a stage where recovery gear is becoming *consumerized* instead of feeling like only hospitals and clinics can access it?  

It‚Äôs such a strange overlap of practicality and this feeling of, ‚Äúwow, even health-related gear is sliding straight into e-commerce trends.‚Äù Like, once upon a time, you only bought things like sneakers or headphones online. Now? You‚Äôre casually one click away from orthopedic-grade supports.  

It actually makes me wonder a couple things:  

- Are we training ourselves to self-manage recovery with these hot product finds, instead of relying fully on traditional setups?  
- Or are these just clever marketing plays that make something medical *look* lifestyle-friendly?  
- The pricing blows my mind‚Äîbecause if you compare custom medical fittings, you‚Äôd think this would add an extra zero to the price tag.  

I don‚Äôt even have an ankle or foot injury right now (knock on wood), but I couldn‚Äôt resist deep diving into reviews and product setups just because it feels like we‚Äôre in new territory. People are even saying stuff like ‚Äúhad it for two weeks, walked easier.‚Äù That reads less like a standard medical report and more like feedback we‚Äôre used to seeing on coffee mugs and exercise gadgets.  

Part of me is excited‚Äîbecause heck, if recovering from injuries can become more affordable and actually accessible to everyday people, that‚Äôs a legitimate win. But then the confused/conflicted part of me kicks in: am I romanticizing the product as a sign of ‚Äúfuture feels,‚Äù or is this one of those rabbit holes where the internet is just *that* effective at dressing up everything as trendy?  

So yeah... hot product, hot questions, hot takes.  

Would you buy something like this for preparedness, or is there some invisible line we shouldn‚Äôt cross between ‚Äúreal medicine‚Äù and ‚Äúclick-to-cart recovery gear‚Äù? Because now I‚Äôm genuinely stuck thinking about it.",1,1757374131.0,Trendinfo,0,1.0,False

We got the trip through a charity auction and it is for Grand Mayan. We have an option of course to upgrade our room at Grand Mayan or upgrade to Grand Luxe. Its not a whole lot more to upgrade to Grand luxe and it comes with a few extra benefits. It seems like not a bad move to do. We have never been to this resort and it will just be myself and my husband going, no children or parents coming. 

I have been looking at the resort map, and my only concern with choosing Grand Luxe is that we might end up in one of the farthest Grand Luxe buildings. These buildings look they are quite a hike to get from the building we'd stay in to where the majority of the restaurants and other pools are. There is no way to choose what building we get, and since we got this through an auction, I assume we might end up in the farthest one. I know there is transport for guests around the resort grounds, but it sounds like it could be a bit of a hassle if you have to stop at every building and how long you have to wait for another cart to come around if one isn't there when you get to the stop. I understand this is a minor thing in the grand scheme of things, but just curious if anyone has some insight on how long it really takes to get around on foot or by cart transport from the Grand Luxe buildings. We aren't opposed to walking, and of course its a vacation, so not necessarily in a hurry all the time, but just curious if its a pain or not big deal. 

Is Grand Luxe worth it?

We currently are leaning towards upgrading to the 1 bedroom at Grand Mayan right now so we have the kitchen. Figured we can go to the grocery to store or on site market to get what we need to make breakfast and lunch in our room and also buy bottles of liquor to make our own drinks. Hope we can save a little money if possible this way since there is no option for an all inclusive package. Also after reading through these threads about the resort  we will probably bring our own coffee, seasonings and our stanleys to bring drinks to the pool and keep them cold.

We met in a graphic novel analysis class at college and we‚Äôve been able to hit it off very well. She was shy and I was too, but once we got over that hurdle we‚Äôve studied, walked, had coffee, and just hung out together on campus. We talk about our shared hobbies and interests. She‚Äôs super cute, funny, exciting. She always has an energy that I feel like matches my more quiet and laid back persona. We haven‚Äôt officially started dating, but I can definitely feel we have a connection like a close friendship. 

Even though it‚Äôs been only a month and a half, I‚Äôve been having this growing embarrassment deep in me about my personal situation.

I get this internship with the state government. I do not currently work any job, and I really feel pathetic. 

A part of me feels like that maybe dating her will make me want to be a better person, and strive to do more.

Living with parents, jobless, and unable to really fulfill much with the amount of money I currently have (short of 1K dollars). Again, for all I know she‚Äôs doing much more or even less than me.

If anyone‚Äôs in the market for handmade rustic furniture, I‚Äôd love to share my family‚Äôs work with you. We‚Äôve run a woodworking business here in the Valley for over 20 years, and my dad is the brains and talent behind it all. He‚Äôs A comedian and carpenter ‚Äî so as you can imagine, he‚Äôs both creative and meticulous.

He‚Äôs built¬†**thousands of custom pieces**¬†over the years ‚Äî kitchen tables, coffee tables, benches, bookshelves, bedframes, vanities, record cases, and more. If you can dream it, he can build it. Every piece is high-quality, unique, and built to last ‚Äî but also affordable.

On a personal note: my dad was recently approved for a kidney transplant, which is a huge milestone for our family. Once he has the surgery, he‚Äôll be out of work for a while, so I‚Äôm trying to help him ramp up sales in the meantime to give him a little cushion to heal and rest.

If you‚Äôre interested, I‚Äôd be happy to send you photos of his work or even set up a visit to his workshop in North Hollywood. The pieces are beautiful, the craftsmanship speaks for itself, and supporting him would mean the world to us. A few of you in here might already know him, John Diresta. Brother of the ever so talented, Jimmy DiResta! Woodworking King!

1nc37d1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nc37d1,Cupholder hack!,"I have a Pride Jazzy Carbon powerchair and purchased a ""universal"" cup holder that just attaches to my chairs arm with velcro. It works very well for canned drinks or small bottles, but I've been struggling to find coffee mugs that are small enough to fit in it. As a lover of both coffee and cute mugs, this has caused me some amount of frustration. Also, I only have one fully working arm and need that one to operate my joystick, so I can't even just hold the mug while moving around my house. Also, also.. I tend to put my phone in the cupholder when I don't have a drink and then move it to my lap when I do. As you can imagine, the latter results in my phone getting dropped fairly often lol..

Then I saw a post by equipmeot on Instagram (she is awesome - highly recommend for all sorts of OT tips). She shared these cupholder extenders that are made for the cupholders in your car, but can be used on the ones you attach to wheelchairs or walkers. There's a base that goes into your original cupholder (and expands to make sure its in there snuggly). I've seen a few variations, but most come with a bigger cupholder (solving my original problem). But to make things even more cool.. many have a tray, a phone holder, or even additional cup holders! Honestly, some of them start looking a bit go-go-gadget, haha. 

I saw a ton on Amazon all for around $20. I ended up getting one that's just a bigger cupholder + the phone holder, but I plan on getting one with a tray for when I'm at game nights. You can see the first one in my pictures -- that standard size mug was always too big to have in my chair before now! I had no idea these existed, so I just wanted to share the news for anyone in a similar boat. :)

In case anyone's curious, here's how the first two days went. (5'1, 24f, \~120lbs)

  
**9/7-**Sunday. At home.

‚öñMorning weight: 118.8 lbs

‚òï5 am: Coffee

üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è6 am: 4 mile walk (including coffee stop)

ü•ö9:30 am: Felt hungry. Ate 4 boiled eggs, 1 can garbanzos, and broccoli. 609 calories, 44 grams protein. Felt very full and tired immediately after eating. A little hungry about an hour later but the hunger eventually went away. Probably was actually thirst.

üçå12:10 pm: Felt hungry again. Ate texturized soy protein, whole milk, mixed nuts, and 2 bananas. 692 calories, 43g protein. Felt full and satisfied.

üçå 5:00 pm: Hungry. Oats with whey, nuts, and banana. 634 calories, 40g protein. Felt very full after.

ü•ë 7:30 pm: Hungry and have been thinking all day about the avocado I need to eat before I go out of town. Probably actually better not to eat it but my brain has been convincing me for 12 hours that I need it. Food noise has been bad all day. Definitely do not need it, but the goal is to not restrict at all, so I had it. Ate avocado, eggs, and rice cake. 558 calories, 11g protein. Very satisfied. To say I regret eating it would be a lie.

‚öñÔ∏è PM weight: 121.0 lbs

Daily total: 2492 calories, 152 protein



**9/8-** Monday. Traveling.

‚öñMorning weight: 118.6

‚òïÔ∏è 5 am: Coffee

üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 7:20 am: Push workout

‚òïÔ∏è 8:30 am: Hungry and feeling like I guess I want energy and a reward. Had a coffee protein shake (made with whey, yogurt, and peanut butter) from the coffee shop by gym. Was craving and anticipating it. 407 calories, 37g protein (my estimate). It was really good but I drank it really fast and didn‚Äôt take the time to enjoy it like I should‚Äôve.

üçÆ 12:00 pm: Had been hungry a while, probably waited too long to get food. Went to a coffee shop and got a coffee, then ordered a panini and a brownie. Panini made with almond bread, veggies, hummus, mozzarella, and lettuce. ‚ÄúHealthy‚Äù cafe. Unsure of brownie. No clue on calories or protein, just a complete estimate. Estimate 800 calories, 20 protein for both. Had the coffee, then the brownie, then the sandwich. Definitely the wrong order because I was still very hungry after the brownie and was very full after the sandwich. But maybe the right order because I was mentally satisfied after the brownie and physically after the sandwich, and let‚Äôs be honest I was going to eat both either way.

‚òïÔ∏è 3:30 pm: A little hungry. Had another coffee. Was eyeing some cookies but they didn‚Äôt actually look good and I already had the brownie earlier. I decided I‚Äôd rather wait and eat some real food a little later.

üç´ 5:00 pm: Hungry and bored. Had a protein bar. 150 calories, 28g protein. Not real food but could‚Äôve been worse. Being out of town definitely throws me off.

ü•ñ 6:00 pm: Felt very hungry. Went to a take out place and ordered so much food I‚Äôm pretty sure I was judged. And rightfully so, it would be odd for a man twice me size to eat this much at one time, let alone me. Ate an entire plate of potatoes, 2 pieces of fried cheese, a salad, and a cup of beans. Estimated 1600 calories, 30g protein. Ate it in the restaurant so it wasn‚Äôt as bad as binges in the past have been. I ate about half and then realized I was full. Took the other half to go knowing I‚Äôd end up eating it later. I could‚Äôve left it. Went to my hotel and immediately ate the rest. Obviously I know this is bad but I‚Äôm trying not to feel too guilty about it because the whole point of this is to eat what I want without guilt. So in that case I‚Äôm doing it right. However I ate way past comfortable fullness (I'm at hurts to sit fullness) and should at minimum use this as a lesson.

‚öñÔ∏è PM Weight: n/a (no scale)

Daily Total (estimate): 2977 calories, 124g protein

Reflection: Probably needed more protein and more ‚Äúreal food‚Äù.

Going to keep tracking. I'm realizing this definitely aligns a lot with intuitive eating and I am trying to get rid of restriction because I don't want to have to count calories forever. I think I'm getting more used to understanding when I'm hungry and full, just not fully at the point of actually listening to it.",3,1757373556.0,1200isplenty,1,1.0,False

1nc2v5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1nc2v5k/too_selfless/,Too selfless?,"This week was a good reminder of the selfless person I am to others while receiving little to no reciprocation. I truly don‚Äôt need it because I continue being this way. I guess this post is simply a way of letting it out. Does a tree make noise when falling in forest if no one hears it fall?

Picked up Donny, (business partner‚Äôs son) from the airport who hasn‚Äôt moved a finger for me and probably won‚Äôt ever. 

Picked up Miken from the airport who is probably the only one other than Angie (my girlfriend of 9 months)  to actually show some sort of reciprocation. 

Took a pastelito and beer package to Dana and Isaac (Dana is Angie‚Äôs sister) since they‚Äôve basically been quarantined with their baby daughter‚Äôs surgery. Unrequested, just showed up to their apartment and dropped it off at their door at 9pm after working 13 hour shift. Got a text from Dana that was nice but I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll ever get. Nothing from Isaac. As expected though.

Slept over Angie‚Äôs and play fought the kids for 2 hours while she finished some work stuff. Got a terrible allergic reaction to the cats as usual. Got sooo sweaty again. They‚Äôll completely forget these moments existed. 

I had stopped at the mall for my glasses prescription and bought her a pack of socks, two packs of underwear and a set of gold earrings. Nothing for myself. The only time she has bought me an Item was for christmas. 

Got a 12 pack of beer and offered some to Jack (Angie‚Äôs brother, who lives with her). We sat there and chatted for awhile, It was nice but superficial and another one who won‚Äôt ever move a finger for me. 

Hell of a partner to Angie for her business event. (Fall festival vendor type). Loading up the kid, all of her supplies and set up. Driving. Setting up. Her forgetting the canopy, maintaining my cool and just going back to get it. (20 min drive one wat) Fetching her coffee, then breakfast, then water. Helping her sell. She‚Äôs appreciative but thats all I‚Äôll say. 

Got my cousin/god brother Alex a $170 bottle for his birthday and enjoyed aome family time. Talking and laughing it up. Alex shows reciprocation. He‚Äôs really the only one who calls to just see how I‚Äôm doing and the only one to celebrate my birthday last year. (We went to the brewery).

Ralph needed somewhere to park his harley Saturday so he called and asked if he could use my shed. Of course, I say yes. He comes while I‚Äôm at Alex‚Äôs gathering Sunday night so I leave and take him to get his bike. He has always and will continue to charge me for haircuts at full price. Lol

I will say a big defect of mine regarding self-care and self preservation is nutrition and sleep. Mom has continued coming through with meals and worrying about me eating. And Angie continuously worries and feeds me more than anyone ever has. And well at night, when we‚Äôre apart does her best to ease me before bed. Works most nights, 9/10 nights I‚Äôll get 4 hours of sleep.

I still have to do the driver class on the off chance one day they need me to go get a part or deliver something.

I am seeking advice on a personal situation regarding a shop that has recently opened in my town, but I also want to hear some general feelings about church coffee shops overall.

. . .

As I said, one recently popped up in my town and I am really trying to get rid of the bad taste in my mouth about it. I have had bad experiences with churches and I don‚Äôt know if what I‚Äôm feeling is valid or biased. Here‚Äôs some background:

I am a barista/server at a small local cafe and bakery downtown with a full specialty coffee menu. We were previously the only place in town that serves coffee. Today, the church that my family attends opened their coffee shop on the same block. 

The pastor and his wife visit my cafe from time to time and I believe they are genuinely good people with a good purpose. Their coffee shop is labeled as ‚Äònonprofit‚Äô and they will be donating to charities, ministries, etc. I was wary but still supportive of this idea until one day, a few months ago, the pastor pulled me aside, said something along the lines of ‚Äúno offense, but she (my boss) doesn‚Äôt make real drinks,‚Äù and then offered me a job. 

This felt iffy to me. I am loyal to my boss/shop and I don‚Äôt think the statement he made was correct or fair. However, I decided to try and let this go and continue to be supportive. Today my mom and I tried it out, and I was once again irked when I saw that their setup was almost exactly identical to ours, including flavors, syrup brands, espresso beans, and even renamed versions of some of our signature drinks. Now this could totally be a coincidence as a lot of coffee shops have similar drinks, and of course local shops will source from local roasters. But the insult when you are opening on the same block, using the same setup, and even potentially taking our employees by offering me a job really felt‚Ä¶ off.

I am conflicted because, as I said, these are genuinely good people with a good purpose. While I am an atheist and have had bad experiences in the past, I have been attending church and attempting to let go of some prejudices in support of my family who have started their own spiritual journey. I don‚Äôt want my bad experiences to stop me from being a part of what is potentially a great cause. 

I am also unsure about how I feel about the connection between church and profit in general. While I trust these people‚Äôs intentions and I know the money will go to a good place, there‚Äôs no way to guarantee what other church coffee shops are doing with their funds. And if you know anything about church and money, you‚Äôd know that it is very easy to find loopholes with taxes etc. and take advantage of it. 


In summary I am asking:
1. Generally, are church coffee shops good/bad and something I should open my mind to and support?
2. Am I correct in the way I feel about my personal situation or should I try to let go of my opinion? ",19,1757372684.0,barista,32,0.88,False

However, I saw on Indeed that a lot of people actually really liked working there and I‚Äôve heard pretty good things about them but I wanted to know how my stand specifically is so I decided I‚Äôd go talk to them. 

Pause for a moment to say, I‚Äôm not a DB girl. I like energy drinks but every time I get a Rebel, it tastes slightly off and a little gross, and there‚Äôs a local place right down the road, so I hardly ever go to DB. Recently, I‚Äôd been drinking coffee again after quitting as a middle schoolers to switch to redbull and have been liking it, so I figured I‚Äôd get coffee today. 

Well, I park and walk up to the stand and order a white chocolate latte w oat milk. The broista who made it brought it to me and turned to walk away before I stopped to talk to her about her experience. I say that to make note that she had no idea I wanted to talk to her and made my drink like she would for any other customer. The conversation was great and she actually had really positive things to say about our stand‚Äôs management, which was exciting, and I left feeling good. However, I took a drink of my coffee after I got to the car and died inside. The espresso was SO burnt, it literally tastes like a cigarette in the aftertaste. When I walked up, there was one car waiting in the drive-thru and I saw the broista‚Äôs make a fresh shot, so I assume they made a fresh shot for me too (I didn‚Äôt actually see) but I swear they had a shot that had been sitting for an hour that they used. /Hj. 

I don‚Äôt care about the coffee too much, but I am some who deeply cares about doing things well and doing everything I do with excellence and I‚Äôm so put off by how bad she fucked up the shot.

# Bleeding Across the South

**A tale of loyalty, desperation and loss.**

Origins

Donovan Larrick, sixteen, lost his father overseas before he could walk. Kit Ketrey, seventeen, lost his mother to a heroin overdose. They work the counter at a failing pawn shop in small-town Georgia, keeping the lights on with side hustles: fake jewelry, skimmed cash, and unregistered pistols.

Donovan spends his nights on Luna‚Äôs porch. She's his girlfriend, first love and the center of his world trapped in an abusive home. He is saving every dollar he can to get her out and move out of town with her.

Don and Kit are glued together like brothers. They work dead-end shifts at the pawn shop, scamming where they can, and killing long nights with cigarettes, old kung fu movies, and each other‚Äôs company.

Segment I: Easy Money.

One night in the pawn shop‚Äôs back office, Kit stumbles on a job post that feels both stupid and serious: $1,000 cash to torch a suburban home. The request is posted under a throwaway handle by a man named Clay Holloway.

Clay‚Äôs father, Walter Holloway, had been a local real estate baron‚Äîowned half the strip malls in the county. When Walter died, his will divided everything between Clay‚Äôs two older sisters and his younger brother. Clay got nothing. ‚ÄúIncompetent, unfit to manage finances,‚Äù it reads. Clay fought it in court. The siblings lawyered up. After six months of bitter probate hearings, Clay was slapped with legal fees he couldn‚Äôt pay and barred from appealing again. His sisters sold off Walter‚Äôs boat and vacation property, cashed in a hefty life insurance policy, and put the suburban house--the family‚Äôs original home--on the market.

Donovan leans over Kit‚Äôs shoulder, reading every line. ‚ÄúA grand for one night‚Äôs work. That‚Äôs more than we‚Äôll make in a month here.‚Äù

They reach out to the poster, Clay Holloway, and strike a deal: one thousand dollars in cash for burning the house to the ground, and payment after the job is finished, They decide on a date for tomorrow night, around 3-4AM.

3:00 A.M.

The sedan creeps down the street, headlights off. They cut the engine and let it die. The car ticks as it cools, metal settling into silence.

Donovan steps out first. Baggy black cargos stuffed into boots, suspenders hanging over a plain shirt. A rifle slung across his back, heavy. Beretta M9 on his hip, flashlight fixed under the barrel. Military posture in a quiet suburb.

Kit slips out the passenger side, wearing all black.

He looks like the dark itself. He opens the trunk, hauls out the duffel, the zipper rattling like a warning. Gas cans, chemicals, oily rags, a handful of firecrackers.

The house waits at the end of the driveway. Dark. Hollow. For Sale sign tilted in the grass, sun-bleached No Trespassing nailed to the fence. The kind of place that feels emptied of air.

They cut across the ditch, boots crunching leaves. Kit notices the breaker box. It has a pad-lock.

The carport stretches along the cement drive. They notice the sliding glass door that leads into the living room. Locked.

Donovan pulls the Beretta. Clicks the light on. Pops one round. Glass shatters, raining over the concrete in sharp little teeth.

They step inside. Careful steps over broken glass. Flashlights sweeping, guns drawn.

The house smells stale, like carpet and dust. Big mirrors reflect their beams back at them. Wide rooms. Vaulted ceilings. Built in the 80s, still carrying that weird family comfort.

Their flash lights cutting through the darkness.

Kit kneels, drops the duffel. Starts pulling gear. Gas cans. Matches. Firecrackers. He lines them up like tools on a workbench.

Don shines his light down the hallway. Checks each corner. Empty. Just beige walls, carpet, old wallpaper peeling in the dining room. The house has been stripped, but the bones are still here.

Kit twists a gas can open, the fumes spilling out sharp.

They pour, gasoline soaking deep into the carpet, dark stains spreading. Kit shoves firecrackers in the corner, sticks a rag like a fuse.

Don glances at a cracked wall mirror. His flashlight catches his reflection.

The house breathes gasoline.

Kit lights a test fuse. Smoke curls up. His voice is low. ‚ÄúOne thousand bucks feels cheap for something this big.‚Äù

The fire begins to spread, and Don and Kit run out.

Segment II: The Repo Job.

After torching the house, Don and Kit get tipped off to another job on the forum. This one‚Äôs from a man who just lost everything in a bitter divorce. His ex-wife kept the car he loved, a cherry-red ‚Äô71 Chevelle, and then bragged about her new boyfriend driving it around town. For $800, He wants it gone. No questions asked.

The boys take him up on his offer.

3:15AM.

The street‚Äôs quiet. No cars, no lights on, just the two of them pulling up to the driveway. Don cuts the engine and kills the headlights. The car ticks as it cools.

Kit crouches behind some bushes near the garage. Don is right behind him, rifle on his back, Beretta at his side. They move slow, careful, knowing every sound carries.

The garage has a simple padlock. Kit pulls out a set of picks from his pocket and starts working it. A couple of clicks, some pressure, and the lock pops. He motions Don over. No words. Just a nod.

Inside, the garage smells like oil, dust, and old tires. The ‚Äô71 Chevelle sits tight against the shelves, the paint dull in the weak light from a single bulb overhead. Kit moves along the side, checking corners, workbenches, and boxes. Don crouches behind the car, flashlight sweeping rims, tires, windows.

‚ÄúKeys?‚Äù Don asks, voice low.

Kit slides the center console open, grabs a small envelope with the registration, and tucks it into his jacket. ‚ÄúAll clear.""

They slide the Chevelle out carefully, inch by inch, along the driveway so the engine won‚Äôt start inside the garage and wake anyone up. Kit kneels beside the ignition, signaling Don.

‚ÄúStay inside. Keep an eye on the house. Any movement, any sound, you signal me.‚Äù

Don nods, moves back into the garage and gently opens the door that leads inside. He steps quietly, boots whispering over the wood floors. The house is normal‚Äîfurniture, TV, books, nothing flashy. No alarms, no surprises.

He notices a slice of bread on the counter. Shrugs. Pops it in the toaster.

Cut to Kit outside, crouched at the wheel, patiently trying the ignition without revving it. Sparks, clicks, nothing.

Cut back to Don, nibbling toast, chewing slow, alert. Silence except for the faint ticking of the toaster and the subtle sound of his boots on the floor.

Curiosity wins. He creeps upstairs on tiptoe, scanning the hallway, hands brushing the railing.

Then a sound. From the bedroom.

A low, unmistakable moan. Female. Followed by rhythmic pounding.

Don freezes, grimaces, disgusted, then carefully retreats down the stairs as quietly as he can. Boots soft on the wood, body tense.

Outside, he meets Kit, who hasn‚Äôt moved a muscle.

Kit finally gets the ignition to catch. The engine hums low, no revving, no sudden noise. Don slides behind the wheel, shifting smoothly. Kit rides shotgun, scanning the backroads, eyes sharp.

They take the Chevelle off the driveway, careful not to hit gravel or make a sound, hugging the shadows. The night smells of mud and wet leaves.

Minutes later, they reach a remote swamp, thick with reeds and soft mud, a place nobody would ever think to check. Don guides the car slowly, inch by inch, until the tires sink, then the hubcaps, then the body, swallowing it whole. Water and mud cover the chrome. The Chevelle is gone, lost to the black swamp.

They climb out, boots muddy, chest heaving from adrenaline, but grinning. Don lights a cigarette.

‚ÄúClean,‚Äù he says.

Kit wipes his hands on his cargos, smirking. ‚ÄúToo easy.‚Äù

Segment III: The Warning

The fourth forum job isn‚Äôt fire or theft like the last -- it‚Äôs intimidation. Denny Rogers, a greasy loan shark who runs his racket out of a billiards hall, posts the job. Randall Corbin owes him a pile, and Denny wants the reminder delivered loud enough that Randall pisses himself but quiet enough the cops don‚Äôt get wind.

Don and Kit take it. They track Randall to a neon-soaked nightclub, bass rattling the walls. The crowd is a mess of perfume, sweat, and cheap vodka.

They push through until Kit spots Randall and some random woman slipping into the bathroom. Don pounds on the last stall door.

RANDALL (muffled, grunting): ‚ÄúOccupied, asshole!‚Äù

Don slams his boot through the lock. The door flies open, revealing Randall, shirt untucked, pants tangled at his knees, a girl crouched in front of him on the filthy tile. Her lipstick is smeared, her eyes wide. Randall curses, trying to cover himself.

DON (cold, raising the Beretta): ‚ÄúOut of the way, girlie.‚Äù

The girl bolts, heels clattering on the tile. Kit plants himself at the bathroom door, pistol low but ready. Don presses the barrel in-between Randall's eyes.

Don intimidates him and tells him the clock is ticking.

After leaving Randall trembling in the bathroom stall, Don and Kit head to the bar inside the club. The bass rattles their chests, neon lights reflecting off spilled drinks. They slide onto bar stools, order beers with their fake IDs, and let themselves relax a little. Kit sips cautiously, scanning the crowd for trouble. Don downs half his beer in one gulp, laughing, shaking his head at the absurdity of what just happened.

Finally, they leave through the main entrance, stepping out into the empty streets. The chilly night air hits them.

Don notices a young, buxom woman being sexually harassed by an older, sleazy man. He steps in gently at first, politely telling the man to back off. When the man pushes and mocks him, Don‚Äôs soft-hearted patience snaps -- he beats the guy mercilessly, leaving him bleeding and humiliated. The woman escapes safely, and Kit smirks at Don‚Äôs brutal efficiency. The encounter shows Don‚Äôs moral code: he‚Äôs compassionate but will not tolerate injustice, even on the streets.

Don strolls into the diner late at night, the neon sign flickering outside painting the empty booths in pink and blue. Luna‚Äôs behind the counter, effortlessly juggling orders, and he can‚Äôt resist tossing her a sarcastic joke. She fires back, sharp and playful, and just like that, the night hums with easy laughter. He lingers, helping her refill coffee, swapping stories with regulars, leaning on the counter, and Don eats a killer omelette, and for a few hours, the weight of their pasts feels a little lighter.

Segment IV: The Contract

Kit spends hours in the pawn shop‚Äôs back office, scrolling shady forums. He finds a post by Nico Riggs offering five thousand dollars to kill Vicki Ramirez, Nico Riggs wants his ex-wife dead to collect a life insurance payout and recoup losses from recent divorce settlements and court costs. The post is sloppy, bitter, and chillingly real.

The terms are simple. A small amount of crypto sits in escrow. The rest releases only after proof of death. The client wants Vicki‚Äôs phone and a photo of a playing card laid on her body.

Kit is hesitant at first. Donovan sees five thousand dollars and a way to rescue Luna. Vicki had a life insurance policy. Nico believes her death is the only way to recover the money she took in the divorce.

The Plan

They stage it as a burglary. They steal a car, wear gloves, take a .38 revolver for noise control, and a 9mm as backup. Tuesday night is chosen because Vicki usually returns from the salon late.

The plan is to cut power to lights and cameras, take the phone, drop the card, and leave without being seen.

What Goes Wrong

Vicki is not alone. Her boyfriend has two friends over watching a game.

The doorbell camera still works on battery and records their faces in partial profile. A fragment of the stolen car‚Äôs plate is captured. A neighbor hears a struggle and calls 911. Patrol cars arrive early.

Inside, the boyfriend rushes Donovan. The .38 misfires on a bad round. Donovan switches to the 9mm. Kit is tackled. A second shot ricochets and kills one of the friends.

Vicki grabs a knife and slashes Donovan‚Äôs arm. Kit shoots her. Donovan places the playing card on her body and takes her phone to satisfy the forum‚Äôs proof requirements.

They flee but drop a glove in the yard. DNA is left behind. The doorbell camera has recorded everything.

Vicki is dead, but the scene is far from clean. Three additional deaths occur. The news calls it a massacre. The forum freezes the escrow. Nico deletes his account. There is no payout, only a manhunt.

Escape

Traffic cameras and the doorbell footage catch the stolen Civic. Gas-station footage shows Donovan buying gauze and hydrogen peroxide twenty minutes after the murders.

The 9mm casings match ammo Kit recently resold from the pawn shop. Detectives begin canvassing the strip mall. Witnesses recognize Donovan and Kit.

If they stay, they will be caught. They take cash from the pawn shop, ditch the Civic, and hop a freight train heading west.

The Road

They travel through Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, changing cars often. They lift wallets at truck stops. They sleep wherever they can, hitchhike, crash nightclubs and bars frequently, steal cars, hop freight trains, and avoid law enforcement at every turn, they first hop a freight town to escape and ditch their car.

Hitchhiking

Donovan and Kit leap from a slow-moving freight train onto a gravel shoulder. Their legs burn, arms are scraped, and hearts hammer.

A beat-up Honda pulls over. Morgan leans out the window. She sees the cuts and fear but does not ask questions. She lets them in.

Inside the car, they whisper jokes and share a smoke, trying to calm down. For a moment, the world feels normal. By dawn, Morgan drops them at a roadside motel. She leaves a map marked with backroads and a small trace of human kindness before disappearing.

Billy

On the streets next to a casino, Billy Tran is running with a duffel bag. He has ripped a rigged dice game and owes dangerous people.

Donovan and Kit corner him, expecting an easy score. Billy offers the car, cash, and himself. By midnight, the three of them are driving down empty streets, reckless but feeling free.

Town-to-Town

By the time they reach Lafayette, fear and tension weigh heavily on them. They juggle fake IDs, crowded clubs, and the constant fear of recognition.

‚ÄúWhat is Love‚Äù blares on a club speaker, a cruel reminder of the carefree life they no longer have. A stripper‚Äôs keys provide the next getaway. News updates flash on phones and TVs: four dead in Georgia, two juveniles wanted, police warn they are armed and dangerous.

Who is on Their Trail

Ulrick Birch, a private investigator hired by Vicki‚Äôs sister, tracks the boys through eyewitness reports, gas-station surveillance, and pawn shop records. He shadows their movements quietly, piecing together their trail from what people say and what they leave behind.

Loris Delmar, a bounty hunter, is after Billy for skipping bond on the casino scam. Loris does not care about the murders, only bringing Billy in.

Local and state police coordinate once the doorbell footage circulates. The manhunt intensifies. The case is no longer a whodunit. It is a dragnet.

Themes

The story explores love, loyalty, and loss. It shows teens forced into crime by circumstance and desperation. Consequences are immediate, brutal, and often unfair.",1,1757372308.0,filmmaking,0,1.0,False

Background:  
After Hurricane Ida, I remember Rouse's having open, public WiFi available (though not sure if they still do).  The minute they opened after the storm, I was there to buy supplies and was able to use their WiFi to make some much-needed calls. Now, I think this list could be a crucial part of everyone's Hurricane Prep Kit.

Also, I know there are a ton of coffee shops and other places that have WiFi for their customers but they're password protected.  Don't include those here.",8,1757372233.0,NewOrleans,8,0.9,False
