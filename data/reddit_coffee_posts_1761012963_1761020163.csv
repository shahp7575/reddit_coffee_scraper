1. I'm neurodivergent (ADHD) so my personality opens me up to investigation pretty quickly.
2. Most of the social groups I hang out with are either online cis nerd/gaming people or cis queer people and they all have a lot of experience with trans folk or are observant just in general so they pick up on it very quickly.

People can just tell. They won't always address it but you know they know. Some nerdy bi guy will start giving me a lot of attention for no reason or bring up topics like thigh highs around me. 

Gen Z men are much better at clocking me than older generations because there's more awareness about us online. Some guy knew I was trans because I mentioned I liked 2016 soundcloud rap music and as soon as he heard that all the pieces came together ü§Ø wow! You can't even have a personality beyond stereotypical Starbucks girl without opening yourself up to being clocked! Amazing.

I pass as cis on the street talking to strangers, ordering a coffee, random client presentations at work etc but to me that doesn't count as passing because all I am doing is relying on ‚ú®cis people's ignorance‚ú®!! üòçüòç 

How are we passing if we are just relying on ignorance? Passing to me is not being read trans by anybody - period (except other trans people).

Before I begun my transition I did a lot of reading online from subreddits like this, trying to understand what the likelihood is of passing etc. Everybody online says a big majority of people pass with enough practice, some need FFS but most don't, everyone's so supportive etc or they'll go into bullshit details like ""well actually, ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è1 in 10 women have masculine jaws, look at Angelina Jolie. You'll be fine queen!"" dude that's ANGELINA FKING JOLIE like shut up, of course she hardly gets questioned because 99% of the rest of her is standard female structure/features. 

Being '1 in 10' doesn't reflect REALITY. Yes there are 8 foot tall cis girls but they probably spend most of their life getting transphobic comments and nobody in the community seems to want to address that when giving advice online.

I understand the trans community don't want to stop people from being who they are, but I'll be honest with you. If I knew this is how my life was going to be I probably wouldn't have transitioned. Nobody feels like they want to tell you the harsh truth in our group, you'll ask questions about why you are doubting transitioning and people just rub it off non-chalantly like everythings fine!

I'm sure a lot of us would have preferred the cold hard truth from other trans people. Otherwise now you have people like me, 4 years later, feeling pretty disappointed in the expectations I had, thinking life was going to be some cis-passing paradise where I just walk around and get to be like cis girls. It's not. I'm sure for a lot of us.",0,1761020005.0,honesttransgender,1,0.5,False

When I grind 15g Coffee for the portafilter basket, the grains are over flowing. 

I use a 40mm tamper to push the grains down a bit below the edge before finishing with the Normcore.

The issue I see is that because 39.25mm is smaller than the 40mm diameter of the portafilter, you can be offcentre a bit when tamping with the Normcore. 

Is this okay or is there a way to center it? 

I find self-leveling works better for cases where the grains do not overflow the basket? Such as for wider portafilters?

At the start, she (26F) told me she had a 9-5 job but also a side business in import/export of goods. She also said she attended a mentoring/business coaching program separately. At this time, I didn't figure this out.

As time went on, I began asking more questions, but she was fairly cagey about it. I gave her the benefit of the doubt (maybe it hadn't kicked off as a business just yet, so I respected it).

Over the last week, I noticed a lot of our conversations were centered around financial freedom, not sticking to the 9-5, doing 'more', development, coaching, spending quality time through building a business together. And then I find out, she is going to a weekend long leadership conference...

After the conference, she had invited me for a coffee to meet one of her friends (and their partner) - turns out they were also at the leadership conference and after several discussions, I found out they had recruited her. I get asked vetting questions, but afterwards, she says that it was nothing like that and she was disappointed I saw it that way.

We had a lot more pointed discussions over the weekend - I figured out she's in a MLM / cult. I asked specific questions and got the answers in a vague but a specific way that told me my intuition was right. Her answers were very brainwashed and scared me because she was speaking / behaving like someone different to who I had got to know over the last 3 months.

I told her there was a clear mismatch in values here, because I don't believe that networking marketing is my cup of tea - she reiterated she hasn't asked me to join but to just have an open mind. Knowing the information about these situations, I know that they would eventually turn her against me because I would be a roadblock to her success... She then flipped it on to me and said that I said I would never leave, always be supportive and that this is showing my true colours.

I ultimately said that the relationship needs to end - I can't be supportive of a partner involved in a pyramid scheme or network marketing space. She proceeded to send me manipulative messages and allowed the relationship to end. AITA?",1,1761019362.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

My eyes fluttered as I roused from my sleep, the weight of heavy eyes lingering as I uncurled myself and arced my back to stretch,¬†

I could hear and feel the slight pop along my spine, as I reached my paws outward, stretching them out from shoulder to bean. My tails likewise stiffened up as I shook off the morning's rust. The gentle light of morning showed through the window of the trailer, illuminating our small but comfortable home.¬†

I carefully lifted my head up and looked down at my belly, I could see the empty space against it where Ullr had been sleeping since the night of our bunker discovery. There was a sudden twinge of fear in my heart as I registered his absence. Lingering thoughts of him being rolled over in my sleep or falling off the rack flashed through my mind, until the moist air of shower steam caught my nose.¬†

*Ah, he‚Äôs just in the shower.*¬†

I let a loud yawn slip my jaws and push myself up with an audible creaking of joints before hopping down onto the floor of the mobile shelter. Leaning forward and into a downward dog pose, I stretched my back completely before raising my torso and lowering my flank in an upward dog.¬†

Downward dog and upward dog. What a silly set of names Ullr had told me when he saw me doing these standard Jaslip limbering stretches.¬†

*Ah Ullr* I thought. I had been worried about him since the encounter in the bunker. When he had almost lost it at the sight of the dead kits in the fallout shelter. The little guy was so confident and witty, it was such a gut kick seeing him so‚Ä¶ vulnerable and meek.¬†

I had been doing my best to make him comfortable and well taken care of‚Ä¶ but it seemed like he became more distant and agitated by the day. I was definitely worried that he was suffering from some level of distress beyond my ability to assist‚Ä¶ at the least though, him snuggling against me while sleeping seemed to ease his troubled mind. He had just been feeling so distant lately‚Ä¶¬†

I cast a wary glance towards the steamy door, my thoughts on my tiny companion filling my mind as I went about my usual morning routine.¬†

It wasn‚Äôt uncommon for Ullr to get up early to shower before I was awake - he is always adamant about being independent, and he knows I like to take my time in the bathroom in the morning. It takes some effort to make all this fur clean with a mobile shower after all! Also, since hitting the big 3-5 I haven‚Äôt been able to hold it in the morning like I used to -

\[SHUSH MIND, I‚ÄôM NOT OLD\]¬†

I warbled to myself, scorning my mind for its treachery, even though the pressure in my lower abdomen told me it wasn‚Äôt untrue.¬†

*Dangit Ullr, please hurry! A lady has to use the little Jaslips room! Errr, big Jaslips room in this scenario, I guess.*

Fixing to take my mind off it, I walked into the little kitchenette and bent over to open the small ground mounted ice box and remove a Kerr flank for breakfast. We were planning to explore an abandoned depot today, so a hearty meal was a must. Need to have energy for potential dangerous adventures after all! As I placed it into the microwave device and set it to body temperature, I cast another antsy glance at the door.

Having to alternate showers is such an inconvenience‚Ä¶ and It really should not be such an issue‚Ä¶ Ullr barely took up any room inside the shower, being little more than a paw in height. The Trombil had even provided him his own little shower area inside the larger one, perfectly sized for comfortable human use! Of course, in their infinite wisdom, they decided that putting any sort of dividing wall or curtain in there wasn‚Äôt necessary‚Ä¶ meaning anyone in either area would have an unobstructed view of their showermate.¬†¬†

Of course, this was no issue for a Jaslip. We often bathed together with family and friends anyway. Sanitation and grooming were social affairs! Humans like Ullr always got so touchy feely about their clothes, and being exposed... She got it in the context of not freezing outside, but inside it was all so pointless. I guess that‚Äôs just a quirk of human modesty though‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre always so concerned about what others see. Silly for a species like Jaslip who never even invented things like pants, but cultural boundaries are important to respect.¬†

Even so, I couldn‚Äôt help but wag my tails in amusement as I remembered the time I figured out just how bashful humans were the hard way.¬†

I hadn‚Äôt thought much of it in that moment, when I ambled on into the shower whilst Ullr was in the middle of taking his own. As soon as I had entered, the poor little lad had clammed up like he just saw an Akalet walk in. As small as he was, he practically shrank down further out of pure embarrassment as he desperately tried to cover himself, and turn away from me.¬†

Curious as to why he was so flustered, I had gotten closer to him, sniffing deeply and remarked how bright red he was, and if he was having some sort of a medical event. I received a soap bar to the snout in reply.¬†

Hah. That‚Äôs one to remember.¬†Ullr is so silly.

As I stepped out of the shower room, the steam escaped from the small door and out into the cavernous hall that was our mobile trailer. To me, this place may as well have been a castle‚Ä¶ even if it felt small sharing it with such a large roommate!¬†

Speaking of which, I saw a very uncomfortable looking Artaya skirt past me and into the bathroom as soon as she saw I wasn‚Äôt occupying it. The poor lady was in such a hurry, I didn‚Äôt even have a chance to say good morning!¬†

Making my way back along the gantry while still drying myself off with my towel, I eventually reached my mech. The machine had been left in a dormant state to save power while I was showering, its cockpit hatch opened against a port in the railing for me to simply walk back inside of it.¬†

Tossing my now damp towel over one of the nearby railings to dry, I crawled up inside the machine and took a seat at the central console. With a few flicks of a switch, the machine came online, the sound of the powering reactor reaching my ears.¬†

*Brekkie time.*¬†

Tromping over to the kitchenette in my colossal machine, I knelt down to open up that weird floor mounted icebox made for Jaslip convenience. With a heavy click, it opened up, unleashing a wave of coolness into my open cockpit.¬†

‚ÄúHmmm, let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶‚Äù As I spoke to myself, I heard the sudden rush of water come on, the familiar rush of the steam powered shower indicating Artaya had begun her own shower.¬†

I pushed aside some of the large hunks of purplish meat; some of it packaged Kerr, others from the Blizzard Elk we had taken down a week or so ago. Behind the alien meat lay my target. A large metal box marked with two simple words on it: \[HUMAN RATIONS\]

With a clunk, I closed the mech's hands around the box and lifted it out of the massive fridge, carrying it back to the table where I could see an empty plate from Artaya‚Äôs breakfast.¬†

As soon as I had it down safely, I brought my mech in the stand down position and lowered the service ladder from the front to climb down onto the table. It was such a laborious process for something that was essentially pulling out breakfast, but this was the burden of the human in a galaxy of giants.¬†

Approaching the metal ice box, I pulled the handle on the pneumatic lock, and swung the heavy door wide.¬†

*Let‚Äôs see what we have.*

I was happily munching on the strange purple bacon analogue when I saw my canine companion finally exit the shower. Her fur was puffed up from the end of the steam dry cycle, giving her the comical appearance of a living cotton ball on 4 legs. I did my best to stifle a laugh, as she cast me a scornful glance and shook herself out, causing her fur to settle back down.

‚ÄúGood morning cotton tails.‚Äù I called out with jest as she chuffed in response.¬†

‚ÄúGood morning, my favorite step hazard.‚Äù¬†

I raised my cup of instant coffee towards her and cracked a smile.¬†

‚ÄúThe intel I pulled at the bunker indicates that this depot might have medium power cores. I could definitely use some of those as spares for the suit,‚Äù I said, thumbing back at the machine.¬†

She looked between the mech and myself before lazily trotting over.

‚ÄúIs it really worth the risk? That old ammunition is probably unstable by now, if it‚Äôs spent the last 30 years in the Esquo elements.‚Äù she replied, eying me with a certain degree of reservation.

‚ÄúThe power cores are worth it for me, honestly. If my current surplus goes down, the suit is good as toasted. Then what would I do?‚Äù

Her tails began to wag quietly behind her.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôd protect you of course! I could carry you around like a kit‚Äôs toy!‚Äù

My smile drooped a bit as I heard her response. I knew she didn‚Äôt mean anything by it, and her happiness was certainly infectious‚Ä¶ but being compared to a child‚Äôs doll did not square with my grand mission to prove my capability to a large and uncaring world.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd love to play dress up with your favorite Ullr, but I‚Äôm not here to be anyone's toy, Artaya‚Ä¶ I like to be useful and there isn‚Äôt much I can do without this thing.‚Äù I said as I pointed up at the mech.¬†

‚ÄúDress up?‚Äù she queried innocently. ‚ÄúWhat is dress up?‚Äù

I was about to reply, when I thought better of giving her any ideas.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll explain it later. Let's get to the task at hand. Let me get back in my mech.‚Äù



I was just starting to climb back up the ladder to my chariot of steel and cable when I saw Artaya‚Äôs ears shoot back and her body tense up like she had heard something.¬†

‚ÄúUllr! Hold on tight, Ullr!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? What‚Äôs wrong Ar-‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt even have a chance to finish her name as I heard a dull thud echoing from somewhere outside that¬† grew into a sudden and violent shaking.¬†

Looping my dominant arm and leg in between the rungs of the ladder, I held on for dear life as the earthquake rocked our small camper trailer. Through it all, Artaya kept her eyes fixed directly on me as everything shook.¬†

After a minute that felt like it dragged on forever, the shaking stopped, leaving only the light clattering of pans and pots in its wake. I breathed deeply and calmed myself down.¬†

Suddenly though, there was another heavy thudding that might have convinced me of an aftershock if I wasn‚Äôt intimately familiar with the sound of Artaya‚Äôs paw falls. The hot breath washing over my back only acted as further confirmation.¬†

‚ÄúWait! Don‚Äôt go up! If another quake starts, you could fall again! Just let me lift you!‚Äù

I looked back at her, a massive snout and concerned eyes taking up most of my periphery.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, Artaya. I can handle it.‚Äù

I turned away from her and began my ascent once more, when I heard a loud whine.¬†

‚ÄúUllr!‚Äù

I grumbled and turned once more. ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, Artaya. I‚Äôm not a helpless-‚Äù My statement was cut off however when a large tail rapidly approached me. I slammed into the wall of soft fluff, which pushed me back against the ladder. Just when it was about to reach a point of discomfort, I felt the tail curl tightly by gently around me, not unlike how I imagined a giant octopus might grab a particularly lively shellfish..¬†

I yelped with surprise as the tail peeled me away from my grip like it was nothing, strong muscles flexing beneath soft fur that for all of my strength as a human man, could more or less do with me as it pleased. And in this case, that was lifting me straight up to the cockpit.¬†

Once I was safely placed onto the open cockpit access ramp, the tail loosened around me and withdrew, and Artaya turned back around to face me, her trio of tails wagging happily.¬†

‚ÄúSorry! I just feel better getting you up there myself! The aftershocks can be rough in this region!‚Äù

My eyes narrowed on hers, and I could see her tails and ears droop a bit.¬†

‚ÄúArtaya.‚Äù I said, a low candor to my voice. ‚ÄúThank you for the help, but I said I had it.‚Äù

She met my gaze with a conciliatory expression, looking somewhat down towards the ground.¬†

‚ÄúS-sorry‚Ä¶ I know you like to handle stuff on your own‚Ä¶‚Äù

I breathed in and exhaled, allowing the sudden flare of indignity to ebb away. She meant her best, after all.¬†

‚ÄúS‚Äôalright, Colonel. Thanks‚Ä¶ for the assist.‚Äù

I gave her a big, somewhat forced smile and thumbs up, her ears perking happily.¬†

‚ÄúShall we get on with our mission, Colonel?‚Äù

She wrrfed in affirmative, her tails finally starting to gain motion again.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI thought you‚Äôd never ask!‚Äù

About 5 miles from the Depot‚Äôs location, we had to depart from our transport - the highway system was far too decayed to risk taking our machine and trailer over. Instead, we had to cut across a nearby icefield on foot to reach our target.

The old depot was as decrepit as just about every structure on this poor, blasted world. I sniffed the air, taking in the plethora of scents that drifted about the musty old building. Its roof seemed to have partially collapsed, with a massive snow drift blowing into the building, collapsing and burying many of the central shelving units.¬†

‚ÄúBe careful Colonel, we don‚Äôt know how much of the structure was compromised in that quake. If we get caught in a collapse, nobody is coming for us‚Ä¶‚Äù Said Ullr, the heavy metal thump of his mech suit‚Äôs metal shod feet echoing through the spacious building.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry Ullr, I‚Äôm lighter on my feet then a Kerr on ice.‚Äù I said, with a playful pride, holding my head high. Unfortunately, my pride at my confidence ended up betraying me, as one of my furiously wagging tails accidentally caught a particularly rusty shelving unit, causing it to buckle inward before collapsing with a thunderous resound.¬†

Leaping away, I could only listen with gritted teeth as several nearby shelves cascaded in collapse, spilling their contents across the entire floor with a wicked clatter.¬†

When at last the avalanche of expired MRE‚Äôs and ammunition had settled, I cast a weary glance upward at Ullr, ears folded back in embarrassment.¬†

‚ÄúWhoops.‚Äù

While Ullr‚Äôs face and scent were covered by the mech‚Äôs chassis, I could practically feel the glare radiating from it like a burning flame, eating its way through the armor.

‚ÄúColonel‚Ä¶‚Äù

He was about to say something when another loud crash echoed through the building, followed by the sound of skittering feet on weathered concrete.¬†

‚ÄúWhat in Frozen Esquo was that?‚Äù I said, as I immediately cast my nose upwards. Despite my best efforts to scent whatever creature was present with us, I could not make it out‚Ä¶ the amount of dust kicked up by the collapse seeing to that. Instead, I only sneezed.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt want to take any chances.‚Äù

I watched as he unleashed the maglock holding the large rifle to his mech‚Äôs back, before swinging it around.¬†

‚ÄúStay close. I‚Äôll take point.‚Äù

Following behind him, I engaged the targeting system on my own back mounted gun, allowing the machine to calibrate to the AR reticle over my eye.¬†

As we creeped around the corner, we came upon an area that had clearly been used for some sort of animal bedding. Massive amounts of fur shed, droppings and long gouges in the wood paneling nearby indicated as much. Ullr knelt down, inspecting the animal sign.

‚ÄúHmmm. It‚Äôs definitely a herbivore.‚Äù He said, withdrawing his massive metal hand.

I breathed a sigh of relief that we weren‚Äôt dealing with something terrifying like an akalet. Ullr didn‚Äôt seem all that relieved however. If anything, he seemed to be gripping that rifle ever more tightly.¬†

‚ÄúUllr? Is everything alright? If it‚Äôs just a herbivore, it can‚Äôt be that-‚Äù

My statement was quite suddenly and violently proven wrong as an ear piercing shriek echoed through the building, and a massive beast came charging out from one of the sub hallways. I spun around in time to see the blizzard elk barreling down directly on my position. I could feel my tails slap into my belly, as they instinctively tucked underneath me, as my mind processed what to do.¬†



CRACK



The deafening sound of the massive gun firing shook me out of my stupor, as the blizzard elk suddenly was stumbled by the hefty round hitting its forward shoulder. Finally willed to action, I scrambled aside, moving out of its way as it slammed the counter behind where I just stood.¬†

‚ÄúLookout Artaya! That thing isn‚Äôt down yet!‚Äù cried Ullr as he tried to manually cycle the action on the gun. Unfortunately, it seemed the mech lacked the dexterity he had in his actual body, as it fumbled with the bolt.¬†

The wounded herbivore thrashed madly, its massive antlers tearing the shelving it had lodged itself in apart, before it turned its gaze to Ullr. Bellowing madly again, it lowered its head and charged towards him, the now crippled leg only managing to slow it down somewhat.¬†

‚ÄúOh fu-‚Äù Ullr cried out, as the creature collided with him, its great antlers slamming into and piercing the frontal armor on his chassis. I could hear him cry out in surprise as it pushed his entire suit backwards into a metal shelving unit. The gun he had used clattered helplessly to the ground, as he was left isolated.

‚ÄúFuck me, fuck me! Artaya! Shoot it!‚Äù

Baring my teeth, I crouched low and let the mounted gun settle onto its target, the reticle focusing squarely on the elk‚Ä¶ and Ullr behind it. The autolock reticle kept trying to affix itself to the rampaging animal, but as it thrashed around, the wavering AR reticle would flash red as it passed over Ullr, triggering the IFF. My heart thumped loudly as I realized that I could not make the shot without also hitting Ullr.¬†

‚ÄúI- I can‚Äôt! I don‚Äôt have a shot!‚Äù

The creature scraped its cloven hooves onto the concrete floor, pushing its antlers deeper into the chassis. Sparks emitted as the outer shell was pierced.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to be a shishekbab Artaya! Take the shot! I trust you!‚Äù

Lips curling up into a silent snarl, I narrowed my eyes and disengaged the autolock‚Ä¶ trying to manually aim the shot as best I could.

The grinding crush of metal and antler echoed through my head like an alarm blaring directly into my ears, and my stomach twisted up tight, threatening to unseat my breakfast. I could feel the heavy thump of my own heart and the blood rushing through my head.¬†

*Aim. Aim. Trigger the shot. Don‚Äôt miss.*¬†

My breathing hitched, the world slowed‚Ä¶ I could see the whole situation in front of me as if it was slow motion. The stag pushing forward, spittle and purple blood from Ullr‚Äôs shot spreading wildly across the ground, as the servo motors on Ullr‚Äôs mech screamed with exertion, hydraulic lines snapping before my very eyes.¬†

I saw the end of my barrel. I saw it line up, visualizing the muzzle flash‚Ä¶ visualizing the projectile sailing forth‚Ä¶. Visualizing it striking the back flank of the blizzard elk. The high caliber round tearing through flesh, muscle and bone‚Ä¶

My eyes settled over the autotrigger and for the briefest moment my confidence swelled.

Then I saw it in my head.¬†

I visualized the round tearing through the elk‚Ä¶ and hitting the center chest of the mech. I visualized the armor piercing round punching right through the machine‚Ä¶ I visualized the cockpit exploding‚Ä¶ the blood, the carnage‚Ä¶ my friend! My tiny friend! My‚Ä¶ companion.

I couldn‚Äôt pull the trigger.

The moment passed and time resumed for me. I watched, transfixed like a pup, as the blizzard elk roared in pain and exertion and thrashed its head up, the massive antlers tearing straight through the upper left arm of the mech, servos and motors screaming as they were shorn loose. The rest of the machine, liberated from a significant portion of its torso, simply fell down to the ground.¬†

It sat there, sparking for a moment, twitching like a dead Kerr as it was ravaged from electrical and mechanical malfunction. Suddenly, my mind caught up to me, as I realized Ullr was no longer in my line of fire. Re-engaging my autolock, I zeroed in on the rampaging herbivore as it turned back to me, rage and fear in its gaze.

I didn‚Äôt even have a chance to fire.¬†

I saw Ullr‚Äôs mech spasm with a mechanical shriek before his intact arm shot down towards the machine's hip. Quicker than I could even realize, the arm withdrew the sidearm from its hip holster and leveled it on the elk. It bellowed and began to charge towards me as he fired. The rapid resound of the gun battered my skull like a drum.¬†



KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK KRAK



The human mag dumped the raging animal, its body jerking with each shot, as the creature cried out in pain and stumbled forward, purple gore spraying from the several center mass chest wounds‚Ä¶ and then it fell. Its breath remained ragged and heavy as it heaved up and down on the ground before the breaths slowed‚Ä¶ and then finally stopped.¬†

It was dead.

Whatever sadness might have gripped my heart at the thought of a creature we hadn‚Äôt intended to kill dying before my eyes was replaced by my concern for Ullr. Practically bounding forward like the mad and fearful beast moments before, I practically shoved my face against the mech‚Äôs center chassis where the cockpit lay, trying to get sound or scent of Ullr.¬†

The mech remained dreadfully quiet for a moment, spiking my fear, before it began to move slightly. *Ullr was alive.*¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúUllr?‚Äù I muttered, quiet as an ice mole. ‚ÄúPlease open up, so I can see you‚Äôre alright‚Ä¶‚Äù

There was no reply for what felt like an eternity, before the center of the machine gave a low hiss, and began to open.¬†

As it opened, I was flooded by a deluge of scent. Heavy cortisol, adrenaline, all mixed with the sweet and salty sweat that I could see dripping down his brow. Although his chest was no longer heaving madly, assuming calming himself down was the reason for his delayed opening, I could still tell he was deeply disturbed. My stomach twisted again as I saw a massive hole in the cockpit wall where one of the antlers had nearly punched all the way through.¬†

*He almost died. I almost let him die.*¬†

I leaned forward and let my tongue roll out, licking lightly at him in an attempt to comfort him.¬†

As my tongue withdrew, I felt his hand rest on my nose. I closed my eyes for a moment, expecting him to just rest his hand on it, or perhaps rub it like he had done before. Instead, I felt a soft pressure grow ever stronger, a discomfort growing on my snout.

He wasn‚Äôt petting me, he‚Äôs pushing me away.¬†

My eyes shot open to meet his own. The mix of fear and anger evident across his scowling face.¬†

I whimpered slightly and stepped back.

‚ÄúArtaya‚Ä¶ WHAT THE HELL!‚Äù

I folded my ears back as I heard him scream out the last three words.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I almost died Artaya! Why didn‚Äôt you shoot the damned thing!?‚Äù

My tails tucked again as I looked away, hoping to hide myself from his scorn.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt take the shot without hitting you‚Ä¶‚Äù I eeked out quietly.¬†

He simply stared at me for a moment before exhaling audibly.¬†

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you just move around to its side? Why didn‚Äôt you just reposition?‚Äù

I felt a sudden wave of blood hit my head all at once.¬†

*Oh sweet Esquo‚Ä¶ why didn‚Äôt I?*

I gave him no response, merely keeping my gaze down.

‚ÄúI swear to God, Artaya, I love you but you are just‚Ä¶ just so damn helpless sometimes!‚Äù

*Fangs right in my heart.* I had heard this all before, but never from someone *I cared about.* ¬†

I jerked my head back up to him, eyes narrowing. He remained undaunted.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ half a foot compared to you? Why am I having to be the one to save you from the giant ass animal!? You‚Äôre supposed to be some soldier from a race of super hunters‚Ä¶ how is that you don‚Äôt even know how dangerous your own wildlife is!?‚Äù

A mix of embarrassment and anger welled up in me, as I felt his accusations fall onto me. They were true, and that's what made them hurt even worse.

‚ÄúS-stop it Ullr. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù I whispered out, lip quivering.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be sorry, Artaya! BE. BETTER!‚Äù

The cacophony of emotions and adrenal rush finally boiled over, as my mind drifted to the many chewings I had received from the Krev police back on Avor‚Ä¶ from the Resket sergeants at the academy‚Ä¶ To the cruelty of Weioki and Kalfa. Those heartless bastards pushed me to the edge‚Ä¶ The edge of my emotions, and it had only been Ullr who kept me from toppling over. Now even he was admonishing me.¬†



The cup overflowed.¬†



Whipping my head up, I did exactly what I wished I had done to that scaly asshole and Ulchid friend.

I pressed my head forward, directly into the cockpit of the mech, lips curled up in a wicked snarl and a deep throated growl less than a foot away from my small compatriot.

‚ÄúSTOP!‚Äù I roared out. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so damn tough huh? I could snap you up in one bite right here!‚Äù

The outburst of anger almost immediately ran into a brick wall of regret with the sudden realization of what I had just done. I just threatened my friend. My only friend. Threatened him in a very real and hurtful way.¬†

My eyes moved to focus on Ullr, as I expected to see him withdraw in fear or disgust, withdrawing from this ravening beast no better than any other wild animal. Instead, I met that same determined gaze that had been staring me down.¬†

My lips fell down, and I backed away.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm so sorry Ullr‚Ä¶. I didn‚Äôt mean that‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶.‚Äù¬†

I felt the tears begin to well up in my eyes, as they threatened to fall.

For a moment, I saw anger flash in his eyes‚Ä¶ Not at the snarl, but at my sudden‚Ä¶ deference? It was almost like he was upset at me backing down.¬†

After a moment though, he breathed deeply and exhaled through his nose.¬†

‚ÄúNo Artaya, I think you did‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs my fault. *I‚Äôm sorry.*‚Äù He seemed to relax in the cockpit chair, and brought a hand up to rub at his nose.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just freaked out because of what happened. I didn‚Äôt mean to treat you like *they* do.‚Äù He reached down and reengaged the manual control of his suit.¬†

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just get back home and get some dinner in us. We‚Äôll both feel better after that. We‚Äôll be laughing at this all in a few hours.‚Äù¬†

I gave no reply as his mech began to move, its movements clunky and imperfect as he bent over to collect the rifle and severed arm. His words did raise my spirit somewhat.

‚ÄúT-thanks Ullr. I‚Äôll grab what I can‚Ä¶ and follow you out.‚Äù

And with that, we set out into the Esquo wasteland once again.

thejacquelineadan Day 8 ‚Äî we finally made it to our destination...Ohio! * we came to Ohio for some personal reasons that I'm keeping off social media, but what I will share is our Ohio coffee spot ‚Äî and it might not have had the best coffee but it was definitely one of the most fun experiences.
They had a coffee flight that had 4 of their most popular summer flavors so of course there was no other option for me to try. But I have to say...they were not my fav
AND I
ended up spilling on my white dress! But that's ok I did not let this ruin my coffee stop or day!
To be honest, by this time of the trip I was struggling. Being away from home and my normal routine was hard. I still felt off from being so sick from the altitude driving in, my eating was off and my mental health was not great. So I relied on a lot of journaling, texting my friends, reading when I could, blasting Taylor Swift, calling my sister and making sure I had my therapist on speed dial. And while all of this didn't really ""fix"" anything, it helped me be able to not go too crazy on the
""all or nothing"" and find some peace and grounding with all the extra noise going on in my head and still enjoy my time in Ohio! We had a nice visit in Ohio, so nothing against this part of the trip, but I was just really strugaling and felt a little ""out of control"" 
Recovery struggles can hit hard at anytime and I am so glad I had tools in my ""toolbox"" to help me. Remember, recovery and therapy is not about making all of your struggles and problems go away, it's about helping you find ways to cope and deal with triggers, struggles or hardships when they arise. So all in all, I am so proud of myself!

I shivered slightly as I finished focusing the lens of the telescope. Why did he have to home in on this out of all his Christmas gifts? I guess I shouldn‚Äôt complain. At least it was something educational. I looked down at Toby, the boy was practically bouncing with excitement, seemingly oblivious to the biting cold. I saw that smile on his face and suddenly it was all worth it. Yes. Even freezing my ass off.

‚ÄúIs it ready?‚Äù He asked excitedly as I pulled back from the device.

‚ÄúSure is. Take a look!‚Äù

The boy rushed forward, sticking his eye on the tiny reticle and peering through it.

‚ÄúWow‚Ä¶‚Äù He gasped as the image of Saturn came into his view. I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh a little. Maybe my boy would be an astronomer one day? Hell! Maybe even an astronaut.

‚ÄúPretty cool huh?‚Äù I said, giving him a gentle pat on the shoulder as he pulled his face away from the telescope.

‚ÄúSuper cool dad!‚Äù He laughed, smiling up at me with those big buck teeth of his. He leaned in, wrapping his arms around my waist and giving me a squeeze. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, pal.‚Äù I replied, giving him a squeeze back, ‚ÄúMerry Christmas.‚Äù He paused at that, letting go of my waist but not really offering any sort of reply. The smile had faded from his face and had been supplanted by hesitation. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong buddy?‚Äù I pressed. Another long moment of hesitation.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt we go to Granny and Papaw‚Äôs house this year?‚Äù He asked, looking down at the ground. I let out a sigh. I know this was hard on him. God did I hate myself for doing this to him. A boy should have both parents after all‚Ä¶ at least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd always been told.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs hard to explain Toby‚Ä¶‚Äù I answered, looking back up at the sea of stars above me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a little young to worry about th‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúMom says it‚Äôs cause they‚Äôre bad people.‚Äù He whined, still keeping his eyes glued to the ground. I silently cursed my ex for a moment. She wasn‚Äôt wrong but‚Ä¶ he was too young to be hearing any of this.

‚ÄúToby‚Ä¶ pal‚Ä¶‚Äù I tried to explain, stumbling over my own words, ‚ÄúYou know your mom and I love you more than anything in the whole wide universe, right?‚Äù The boy simply nodded in reply, ‚ÄúWell Granny and Papaw didn‚Äôt love us more than they hated me.‚Äù I tried, doing my best to try and explain the situation to a seven-year-old.

‚ÄúWhy do they hate you?‚Äù He asked bluntly. It was my turn to hesitate. This was not the conversation I thought I was going to be having on Christmas night.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù I tried to explain in a way he could maybe understand. Was I about to tell him I was gay? I knew how kids were, which is to say‚Ä¶ merciless. If he realized what I was I was terrified he would be bullied or tormented for it.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù He insisted, finally looking back up at me with those same gray eyes. My eyes.

‚ÄúThey just didn‚Äôt think I was a very good person son.‚Äù I tried, hoping to answer his question without having to actually ANSWER his question.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù He whimpered, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a super good person dad!‚Äù I smiled weakly at that, wrapping the little guy once more in my arms.

‚ÄúSometimes grownups think stupid things pal.‚Äù I sighed as he returned this renewed hug, ‚ÄúAll that matters is that you know I‚Äôm not a bad person.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a bad person dad!‚Äù He exclaimed, ‚ÄúAnd if they think you are then they‚Äôre stupid! I love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you too buddy.‚Äù I replied, wiping a silent tear off my cheek before he could notice, ‚ÄúMore than anything in the whole wide universe.‚Äù There was a moment of silence that followed that before he finally spoke again.

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you won‚Äôt leave me one day, will you?‚Äù He asked, his voice just barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù I gasped, pushing him back and latching my hands on his shoulders as I held him in front of me, ‚ÄúListen to me right now buddy! I will NEVER leave you. I don‚Äôt care what you do, nothing will ever make me want to leave you!‚Äù He looked up at me, clearly a little surprised by my reaction to his question.

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù He answered simply before turning his attention back towards the telescope. He leaned back into the eyepiece, letting out a huff. ‚ÄúDid we hit the telescope? It looks like Saturn is only half visible now.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah.‚Äù I assured him, looking through the small sidepiece that served to zero in the telescope, ‚ÄúThe planets don‚Äôt stop moving pal. Gotta reposition it every few minutes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey move that fast?‚Äù He remarked with wonder. I gave him a nod in reply.

‚ÄúYup. Add in the fact that the Earth is rotating and it means it won‚Äôt stay in focus for long.‚Äù

When I was satisfied that the telescope was once more zeroed in on the ringed gas giant I let him peer back through once more. He let out a snort that I took to mean I had been successful.

‚ÄúHey dad? What do you think aliens are like?‚Äù

‚ÄúAliens?‚Äù I repeated, all too happy to change the subject, ‚ÄúWell I imagine they‚Äôre a lot like us pal. You know? Just people living their lives. I know a lot of those sci-fi movies like to make them out to be monsters but‚Ä¶ if you think about it‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt it make a lot more sense to think they‚Äôre more like us than different? I mean I‚Äôm sure they have a bunch of eyes or weird tentacles or something but‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶ under all that they‚Äôre still just people.‚Äù I stopped for a moment, looking up and admiring the countless shimmering jewels above, silhouetted against the infinite darkness. ‚ÄúWho knows? Maybe somewhere out there there‚Äôs an alien looking up like us and wondering what we‚Äôre like?‚Äù

‚ÄúThink the aliens will ever come visit us?‚Äù He pressed, his eye still glued to the telescope lens.

‚ÄúMaybe?‚Äù I replied, a little hopeful myself. What could I say? I was a big sci-fi nerd, ‚ÄúI just hope when they get here that we‚Äôve got our shit sorted out.‚Äù

Toby snickered at hearing me utter a curse word.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù He asked, finally peeling himself away from the telescope.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôd just hate for them to see us how we are now, you know?‚Äù I expounded with a laugh, ‚ÄúI mean if they saw us right now? With all the wars and violence and destroying the environment‚Ä¶ they‚Äôd probably think we‚Äôre a bunch of monsters.‚Äù

After Arthur left Dr. Bilon began to pace, the small quadruped moving back and forth in a clearly anxious state. I noted it with a degree of concern, even as Izra and I made our way into the tiny clinic to check on our tiny Sivkit.

‚ÄúHello little one!‚Äù Izra cooed, her voice softer and more soothing than what one would think possible given her rather imposing exterior, ‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù

‚ÄúSleepy.‚Äù Mixsel replied from her perch atop a nearby table. She reached one paw up and gently rubbed her eyes.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry about what happened, ‚ÄúI chimed up, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm happy you‚Äôre safe now.‚Äù I walked over beside of Izra, the two of us surrounding the sleepy Sivkit. The Arxur reached one clawed hand down and began to gently scratch her head, running her long claws through the girl‚Äôs fur. The girl let out a happy mewl, closing her eyes and leaning into the gentle scritches.

‚ÄúIf I find that ‚Äòdog‚Äô or the human who was supposed to be responsible for it I will‚Ä¶‚Äù Izra began, hesitating for a moment before finishing, ‚ÄúI will give them a very stern talking to.‚Äù I held back a laugh at that. I think even Mixsel knew that was NOT what Izra would do to them.

‚ÄúWhen is Awfu bwinging Fwank back?‚Äù She asked with a wide yawn, clearly fighting hard to stay awake. I cocked my head at that. He hadn‚Äôt mentioned getting Frank. Only that he was going to take a shower. Maybe he was doing both? It made my tail swish happily. Arthur was such a sweet guy. He was always trying to take care of everyone. I thought back to our little dance in the park, my cheeks blooming as I remembered those handsome braids in his brown hair. I wondered if he would grow out the wool on the bottom of his chin long enough for me to braid? I always thought those Venlil guys that braided their chin wool looked so‚Ä¶ Nope. Thoughts for another time. Had a hurt Sivkit to worry about right now.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know little humdrum.‚Äù I answered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go ask Dr. Bilon.‚Äù I gave the girl‚Äôs ear a gentle rub before turning around and heading back into the hallway to ask Bilon a few questions.

The Zurulian jolted up as I opened the door, looking even more anxious than when I had walked into the clinic.

‚ÄúYou ok there Doc?‚Äù I asked, giving him a concerned ear flick. The small, brown alien sighed, standing up on his hind legs finally. He didn‚Äôt answer for a moment, simply taking one paw and scratching his chin contemplatively. Finally, he looked back up at me and shook his head.

‚ÄúJammek‚Ä¶‚Äù He spoke slowly, as if debating whether he even wanted to say the words to start with, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ would‚Ä¶ would you mind checking on Arthur?‚Äù I could sense the strain in his voice even through the translator, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I have a bad feeling.‚Äù

‚ÄúA bad feeling about what?‚Äù I inquired, more than a little confused by the small, alien creature‚Äôs request.

‚ÄúUgh‚Ä¶‚Äù He grumbled, shaking his head, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say too much due to doctor/patient confidentiality but‚Ä¶ Arthur isn‚Äôt in the best state of mind. He hasn‚Äôt been since he was saved from the archive and‚Ä¶ based on some of the notes I read through on the Farsul‚Äôs memory transcription‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm worried he may‚Ä¶ do something foolish.‚Äù That made my eyes go wide, my heart starting to race in my chest.

‚ÄúSomething stupid?‚Äù I mumbled back, the words passing like venom over my tongue. I was fairly certain I knew what he meant but I didn‚Äôt want to believe it.

‚ÄúJammek‚Ä¶‚Äù He groaned, clearly conflicted on how much he felt comfortable sharing with me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried Arthur is going to hurt himself. There‚Äôs a good chance this even might have struck a chord with some trauma in his past. If he has an‚Ä¶ episode‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm worried he won‚Äôt be thinking clearly.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt need anything further. I bolted from the hallway towards the exit.

Sweet Solgalik‚Äôs light! How had I not noticed it before now?!? I was so obsessed with my own pain‚Ä¶ my own loss. I hadn‚Äôt noticed how much Arthur was hurting! I had thought the way he smiled seemed‚Ä¶ different from the other humans I had met in the camp, but up until now I had thought it was just a particularly ‚Äúhim‚Äù style oddity. No. It wasn‚Äôt. It was fake. He‚Äôd been faking that smile so long I couldn‚Äôt even tell it was fake anymore.

Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! You‚Äôd been so happy to just let him dote on you and pet on you that you hadn‚Äôt even bothered to try and see how he was feeling! I cursed my utter lack of social skills for the millionth time in my life as I burst through the doors of the makeshift concierge and blasted off down the street with a speed I didn‚Äôt even know I was capable of.

I had lost Malvi already, my sister nothing but a memory so far gone that nobody would even remember her. I couldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt lose Arthur too! I pushed, forcing my legs to go faster. I could see several people on the street, no doubt walking home from the cookout, turning to look at me as I barreled past them like a lunatic. I didn‚Äôt care. I wasn‚Äôt going to lose my best friend. I couldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶

‚ÄúSo, then what‚Äôs your plan Art?‚Äù She sighed, brushing some of that long blonde hair out of her eyes, ‚ÄúJust live as a hermit for the rest of your life?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, no‚Ä¶‚Äù I replied, giving a dejected shrug, ‚ÄúShit Moira I don‚Äôt know. I just don‚Äôt want to‚Ä¶ make Toby‚Äôs life any harder than it already is.‚Äù My ex-wife shook her head, a look of sympathy written across her face.

‚ÄúArthur‚Ä¶‚Äù She chided, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a good dad and I can certainly understand what you mean but‚Ä¶ Ever since you came out‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt go out anymore. You haven‚Äôt tried dating or even made new friends. I worry about you.‚Äù I gave her my best, manufactured smile. I was getting good at those. I could throw up a fake smile with the best of them. She just continued looking at me with those same sad, blue eyes as she crossed her legs in that oversized, leather recliner.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about me.‚Äù I tried to assure her, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just focused on work and Toby. I can worry about the rest of that as it comes.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give me that shit.‚Äù Moira grumbled, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known you for years and I know when you‚Äôre trying to bullshit. Arthur I‚Äôm not saying you have to rush out and find you a boyfriend but just hiding yourself away in this apartment isn‚Äôt healthy. You should at least try and making some friends.‚Äù

I reached over to the coffee table between us, pulling myself up off my comfy little sofa to grab my mug of steaming tea.

‚ÄúWell can you blame me if I‚Äôm a bit wary on that one, eh?‚Äù I retorted as I took a slow sip of the still steaming liquid, ‚ÄúAll the friends I thought I had decided that I was worth less than dirt the minute they realized I wasn‚Äôt who they wanted me to be?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour friends were shit.‚Äù She hissed in answer, ‚ÄúI told you that from the day I met them. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you should just give up on having friends.‚Äù She sighed again, shaking her head as she leaned forward, placing a hand on my shoulder, ‚ÄúDespite everything I still want you to be happy. You know that right? We‚Äôre still friends.‚Äù

I forced out another smile, hoping this one would be a bit more convincing than my last attempt.

‚ÄúI know. I swear I‚Äôm trying. I just‚Ä¶ need time.‚Äù I explained. It was a better sounding explanation than what I truly felt. There was no point. I‚Äôd made a stupid decision and ruined my life because I just couldn‚Äôt force myself to be‚Ä¶ normal. Would I have been better off just suffering through a marriage with somebody I wasn‚Äôt even attracted to? Would my son‚Äôs life have been better? Was being myself worth becoming a complete pariah?

I shook my head, clearing that thought away. In the end that was still a selfish way to think. I wouldn‚Äôt have been just forcing myself to live a lie. I would have been forcing Moira and Toby to live one too. Moira was a wonderful woman. The fact that she was able to stand by me as I came out was proof of that. She deserved better than a loveless marriage held together just so I didn‚Äôt have to be alone. Despite everything I had gone through, I knew she deserved at least that much.

‚ÄúI just want you to consider it Arthur. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù She continued, ‚ÄúMaybe go out to the bar or something? I don‚Äôt know. I heard that local game shop is holding a D&D night. You always did enjoy that.‚Äù I chuckled, considering it for a moment. It had been a while since I‚Äôd rolled some dice. She seemed to take that as encouragement, managing to pull out a smirk of her own. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take that as a maybe?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù I answered. I knew I wouldn‚Äôt do that though. Most days it was hard enough to drag myself out of bed just to go to work.

‚ÄúHow have you been feeling by the way?‚Äù She questioned, her eyes narrowing at me in a way that led me to believe she knew all too well the answer to her own question.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ hard.‚Äù I admitted, carefully choosing my words, ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm doing ok though.‚Äù That last part I knew was a lie but there was no reason to push my personal burden onto her.

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt help but notice the empty bottles of vodka in your trash.‚Äù She pressed, concern written even deeper into her features now, ‚ÄúThose weren‚Äôt here the last time I visited.‚Äù

‚ÄúI had a few drinks,‚Äù I sighed, waving her concerns off, ‚ÄúNothing to worry about.‚Äù That was a pain that she had seen those. Didn‚Äôt think to hide them away before she got here. Well‚Ä¶ at least she hadn‚Äôt looked in the drawer and seen the gun‚Ä¶

I burst my way though the door, panting and gasping after my mad dash back to the house. I find myself in a silent darkness even gloomier than that which I had been in outside. In a panic I gazed around the house, my ears flicking to and fro as I desperately searched for any sign of Arthur. Speh! What if he hadn‚Äôt really come back to the house? What if he was at the park? Or in any of the countless shadowy alleyways between the houses? For a terrible moment I stood, panting and gasping in the eerie silences as my heart threatened to burst out of my chest.

Finally, a soft sound from upstairs caught my attention. My gaze shot upwards to find a faint light peeking out from under the bathroom door. Arthur! I bounded up the stairs so fast it felt like I was flying. Not wanting to waste a second I flung open the door.

Inside I saw Arthur, bent of the sink. His face looked so much more haggard than he had seemed just a short bit ago and I could see his eyes were puffy and red from crying. I took a quiet step forward, thinking of putting a hand on my friend‚Äôs shoulder as he turned towards me in surprise. That‚Äôs when I saw his hand. His hand was filled with a fistful of small, green capsules and I could see an empty bottle laying in the sink. I froze, just staring at him for a moment as he likewise did the same. I felt my paw clenching at the sight. Then, in a moment of pure instinct I did the one thing I could think to do. I lowered my head and ran straight at him.

Arthur let out a yell as my head collided with his chest, causing him to go flying backwards into the bathtub as the green capsules were sent fly, raining down on the tiled floor with a series of soft \*Tink\* noises.

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you headbutted me.‚Äù He groaned, his legs still leaning over the edge of the tub as he struggled to pull the rest of himself into a sitting position within.

‚Äú**BRAHKING RIGHT I DID!**‚Äù I screamed, looing down at the stunned human, ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll keep doing it till I knock some sense into you!‚Äù

‚ÄúJammy I‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat were you thinking?!?‚Äù I screamed, the panic and terror I felt before twisting into a sense of despair and anger under the soft hum of the fluorescent bathroom light, ‚ÄúWhat would I have told Mixsel when she wakes up? How could I tell her you were dead?!? She needs you Arthur! Speh! I need you!‚Äù Arthur didn‚Äôt reply, simply pulling his legs into the tub along with the rest of him.

Suddenly the towering human I had come to know seemed very small. As Arthur pulled his knees up into his chest, I noted just how different he seemed now. He had seemed enormous since I had first met him. Towering both in height and in personality. He had felt like a rock in a stormy sea, something I could cling to when I felt like I was about to be washed away. But now? Now I saw something totally different. Maybe what I was seeing was really there all along, simply being hidden away. I saw a man who was hurting‚Ä¶ a man who just looked tired and afraid.

‚ÄúJammy‚Ä¶‚Äù He sputtered, fighting back a sob, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt keep doing this. I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm tired of ruining everything.‚Äù I felt my paw slowly unclench as I made my way over and climbed into the bathtub beside him. I sat down, pushing my tail behind his back and pulling him next to me.

‚ÄúArthur.‚Äù I continued, much calmer and gentler now, ‚ÄúYou know what happened wasn‚Äôt you fault right? You didn‚Äôt bring that dog.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is my fault,‚Äù He choked, ‚ÄúThis is what happens‚Ä¶ this is what always happens. I hurt everyone around me. No matter what I do. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm broken.‚Äù I paused, unsure what to say, feeling my own eyes begin to tear up as I looked at my human friend, wallowing in despair. My heart hurt. I cursed myself for not having noticed sooner. But I was going to make up for it.

‚ÄúNo, it isn‚Äôt your fault.‚Äù I insisted, wrapping my arms around him and pulling his head into the wool on my chest, ‚ÄúAnd if you‚Äôre broken then‚Ä¶ then we‚Äôll fix you.‚Äù I insisted. I could feel Arthur shaking his head.

‚ÄúJammy‚Ä¶‚Äù He whimpered, still fighting back sobs, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some kinds of broken you just can‚Äôt fix. I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even deserve to be fixed. All I do is fuck things up for people‚Ä¶ All I ever manage to do is hurt people.‚Äù

I took the opportunity and did for him what he did for me, taking my claws and gently brushing them through that little spot of braided fur atop his head.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true Arthur.‚Äù I insisted, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve done nothing but make my life better since I met you. I don‚Äôt know what I would have done without you here Arthur. I don‚Äôt know why you think you can‚Äôt be fixed or that‚Ä¶ that you don‚Äôt deserve to be fixed but you‚Äôre wrong. You‚Äôre a great person. You deserve to be happy. I don‚Äôt care how long it takes but I‚Äôm going to prove to you that you deserve that.‚Äù The human buried his face in my chest, a few choking sobs shaking his sturdy frame.

‚ÄúWhat if I can‚Äôt be fixed?‚Äù He insisted, ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm just too broken to be fixed?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we can be broken together.‚Äù I answered, squeezing him tight. I could feel him cough and sputter as he fought to hold back the tears. My mind raced back to something he had said to me not too long ago. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with crying.‚Äù

Finally, he relented, sobbing into my chest and releasing those tears he had fought so hard to hold back. A part of me felt guilty that it had taken me so long to see how much he was hurting. He threw himself into helping everyone around him, trying to make sure they were happy and taken care of. The whole time he had been ignoring himself and just pushing all this down until‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ I guess until it just exploded. I just held him there in that tub, gently rubbing his back as he finally let it out.

I‚Äôd lost everything, what little I had that is. I wasn‚Äôt going to let the best friend I‚Äôd ever had go now. At last, the sobs seemed to die down. He lay there a moment longer, his face still buried in my now wet wool. Finally, he pulled back, letting out a half-hearted laugh.

‚ÄúGeez. I‚Äôm sorry for getting you all wet there Mon Ami.‚Äù He said, wiping one, still blood covered, arm across his eyes.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be.‚Äù I assured him, putting a paw up to his soft, squishy cheek, ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt feel like you have to try and hide how you feel around me. Ok?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ thanks.‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what came over me there. It was just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôll figure it out together.‚Äù I promised, moving my tail up from his waist to his chest and giving him an assuring squeeze. I noticed the human wince harshly at that, letting out a wheeze. ‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù I inquired, growing concerned for him once more.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ except‚Ä¶‚Äù He paused, looking like he was trying to fight back laughter, ‚ÄúI think you might have cracked a rib.‚Äù I looked at him blankly for a moment, processing that information.

‚ÄúSpeh.‚Äù I sighed, ‚ÄúGuess we‚Äôll need to tell the Dr.‚Äù I started to stand up when Arthur suddenly grabbed my arm, freezing me in place. I turned a curious eye to him, noticing some tears building back up in those front facing, gray orbs.

‚ÄúCan‚Ä¶ can we sit here for a minute first?‚Äù He asked softly, averting his eyes. I slowly lowered myself back into the white, acrylic tub.

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù I answered, wrapping an arm around his shoulder and tenderly pulling his head onto my shoulder and laying there. We sat together in the tub for a while, not speaking. Just feeling the rhythmic rising and falling of his chest next to mine. I made a silent promise to myself. Maybe Arthur was right and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to fix him‚Ä¶ but I wasn‚Äôt going to stop trying‚Ä¶ ever.",14,1761018135.0,NatureofPredators,2,1.0,False

1oc2nbw,https://i.redd.it/lah6hbxqydwf1.jpeg,San Remo Cube R - did I get sold a refurbished machine advertised as new?   Is it an older model?,"I recently purchased a ‚Äúnew‚Äù Cube R from Pro Coffee Gear.  Apart from the machine showing up with shipping damage to the frame.. it arrived with a cheap abs plastic drip tray, not the stainless steel tray as advertised by both San Remo and Pro Coffee Gear.  The initial ‚Äúfilling‚Äù of the boiler only pulled about 1/4 of the reservoir tank into the boiler, which suggests the boiler was nearly full already (strange?).  The microswitch housing inside of the machine had come loose and the machines lever would not activate the pump (has been fixed and working now.).  The machine also does not have the black cool-touch guards on the wand or the hot water spout.  The steam tip is not the same as advertised either‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm perplexed.  

While Pro Coffee Gear has been somewhat helpful, they have slyly dodged a few of my concerns.  They have claimed to have reached out to San Remo to get me the OEM tray.. but they dodged me suggesting a partial refund on a damaged and falsely advertised machine.  

This post has been a bit long in the tooth, but I am desperate for answers.  Is there someone out there with experience/info and some insight into this?  ",3,1761018044.0,espresso,1,0.8,False
1oc2ly9,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1oc2ly9/i_accidentally_joined_a_cult/,I accidentally joined a cult.,"I‚Äôve always noticed small details other people don‚Äôt. A stain on the ceiling, the exact rhythm of a pen tapping, the smell of lemon cleaner in a room. Those little things matter ‚Äî maybe more than they should.

A few months ago, I wanted a group ‚Äî something structured, safe, predictable. I found one online: The Pathway Circle. Pictures of candles, people meditating in a circle, captions about ‚Äúclearing noise‚Äù and ‚Äúunlocking potential.‚Äù It sounded harmless. Like something that would fit into my routines.

The first meeting was in a community center room. Dim lights. Everyone sat in a circle on the floor. They were almost too welcoming, too precise. They remembered my name instantly. Their smiles lasted slightly too long. Eye contact made my chest tighten, but I nodded and smiled anyway.

We meditated first. Then they went around the circle, sharing ‚Äútransformations.‚Äù When it was my turn, I said I liked schedules and that meeting people was hard for me. Everyone nodded like I‚Äôd said something profound. I kept thinking, I didn‚Äôt say anything deep. Why are they smiling like that?

They used one phrase over and over: ‚ÄúThe Circle provides.‚Äù At first, I thought it was a metaphor. Then someone mentioned being behind on rent, and a week later their rent was covered. That‚Äôs when I felt the first real prick of unease.

I didn‚Äôt leave. I told myself I‚Äôd just observe. Marin, the woman who cried about rent during the meeting, later invited me to her house to see some books she thought I‚Äôd like. I told myself it would be quick, controlled: drop a thing off, leave.

Her house smelled like cloves and orange peel. Dim lights, candles, the faint hum of electronics. The meeting there followed the same pattern ‚Äî breathing exercises, confessions, and the leader taking notes in a black notebook with a gold circle symbol.

Afterward, Marin said she needed to check something in the back room and returned with a thin manila folder. The tab read: STATE vs. [REDACTED] ‚Äî MURDER CHARGES. My hands went cold. She handed it to me like it was a pamphlet.

Inside were photocopies: police reports, coroner‚Äôs notes about blunt force trauma, photos of an apartment with a ledger and a smudge on the wall, and a typed statement with her signature. The name matched the rent collector she‚Äôd cried about months ago.

I remember the folder in my hands ‚Äî coffee stains on the corner, rusted staples. My vision went gray at the edges, my chest throbbed. I told myself to sit, and I collapsed into a chair. For a moment, the world was just soundless gray.

I woke on the rug with a wet cloth on my forehead. Marin was there, checking my pulse, calm. I don‚Äôt understand why. She looked almost‚Ä¶ small in that moment, like the light was too bright for her. I left her house clutching the folder like it was a fragile part of my body.

I did not call the police. I did not make a scene. I sat at my kitchen table and sorted the papers. Court dates, signatures, photos, coroner‚Äôs notes. The last docket was months old. Everything looked official, precise, mapped out in a way that made my brain want to catalogue it.

I sleep with a lamp. I check the corners of packages before opening them. I keep the folder on the highest shelf I can reach. I watch online for photos of black notebooks.

Before I start I didn‚Äôt know where this would qualify. Hi I‚Äôm A I‚Äôm 29 and autistic ( this is relevant) I used to love any chocolate flavored drinks. That was until semi recently. When I was 19 I started a day program where this man (L) was a staff and his wife was the program director. He worked there up until after his wife died. When I had started feeling more confident an actually wearing clothes not baggy jeans had made some comments. He said they hugged my curves. At the time I don‚Äôt think anything of it. Now I‚Äôm not so sure. Fast forward a few months after his wife died. I went back to said program and until my ride situation got figured out. He was willing to take me home. Sometimes when he would he would treat me to a mocha from his favorite coffee place. I‚Äôd like to know that i loved anything chocolate drink related. Fast forward. He started making me really uncomfortable and unsafe. He had said he would give me stuff if I had let him do stuff to me or give him what he wants. I didn‚Äôt do anything. His exact words were ‚Äúyou know, if you throw me a bone once and awhile I‚Äôd be inclined to do more for you‚Äù he also did this in front of his son who also has autism. A slightly more severe version than mine and L has often said that he doesn‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs happening. Which is not the case because after I quit that program last year there was a rumor that spread about me that L and I were involved in that way. We were not. The rumor got to his son and he had a major meltdown. Which to me shows he underestimates his son‚Äôs intelligence. I for the longest time thought that he loved me like a daughter and i looked up to him as a father since I don‚Äôt have a good relationship with my dad ( he knows this) the last time he and i spoke was on a Saturday I was hanging out with my friends and tagged 2 of them in a post on fb. The other one didn‚Äôt have social media. He had seen it and hounded me with questions about why I was hanging out with them and I only hang out with people like the third person and not them. I had called him out and he ended up blocking me. Since him I haven‚Äôt been able to drink any  regular chocolate drink. I can drink white chocolate since I have no issues with that but I hate chocolate milk and regular mochas now and it‚Äôs because of him. I love all other chocolate just not in drink form.

1oc2jnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdGPT/comments/1oc2jnv/contextual_targeting_is_quietly_taking_over_again/,Contextual Targeting Is Quietly Taking Over Again,"For years, we‚Äôve been obsessed with *behavioral targeting.*

Tracking people across every website they visit, collecting cookies, and serving them the same ad five times until they either buy or block you.

That era is fading fast. 

Privacy regulations, cookie deprecation, and user fatigue have forced marketers to rethink how we reach people. And that‚Äôs where **contextual targeting** steps back into the spotlight.

**What It Actually Means**

Instead of relying on user data, contextual targeting places ads *based on the content* someone is engaging with right now.

**Example:**  
If I‚Äôm reading an article about marathon training, show me an ad for running shoes ‚Äî not cat food. It‚Äôs about **relevance in the moment**, not history from six months ago.

**Why It Works So Well**

Because intent hides in context.

Two people might both be ‚Äúinterested in tech,‚Äù  
but one‚Äôs reading about cybersecurity,  
and the other‚Äôs watching a video on gaming GPUs.

Same audience, totally different mindset.

***Contextual targeting picks up on that difference.***

And it‚Äôs not creepy.

No personal data.  
No tracking across apps.  
Just smart placement.

**Real-World Examples üëá**

‚Ä¢ Coffee brand showing up on productivity blogs.  
‚Ä¢ Project management tool featured in remote work articles.  
‚Ä¢ Fitness app ads appearing on wellness podcasts.

Each feels *native*, because it fits the user‚Äôs mindset at ***that exact time.***

**Bonus: It‚Äôs Future-Proof**

As third-party cookies disappear, contextual targeting is becoming the backbone of privacy-safe advertising.

It works with machine learning, semantic analysis, and natural language models to understand what a page is *about*, not just the keywords.

So instead of ‚Äúthrow ad here,‚Äù  
you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúshow this ad where it makes sense.‚Äù

We‚Äôve come full circle.

Back to relevance.  
Back to empathy.  
Back to **context**.

***And maybe‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs exactly where great marketing was meant to stay.***

1oc2g43,https://www.reddit.com/r/couplesresortsjamaica/comments/1oc2g43/review_of_couples_negril/,Review of Couples Negril,"This is going to be long. I was very picky while booking and am writing this to help anyone who may have similar questions as I did. 

My husband and I just returned from our first visit to Couples Negril for our honeymoon. The Couples brand was recommended to me by a coworker who has been many times. They recommended Swept Away, but I decided with it being our first all inclusive the smaller resort would help us to not feel overwhelmed. I researched many AIs, in many countries, and found that Couples seemed to be the best bang for our buck. The price includes water sports and excursions (snorkeling, scuba diving, catamaran cruise, glass bottom boat, and more). The water sports staff are very helpful and knowledgeable. Another thing that we liked is there is no tipping at Couples, and they do not have tiers of service. It is a true all inclusive experience. There was NO other AI brand I came across that offers these things. 

With it being our first time in Jamaica, and traveling during hurricane season, I had a lot of concerns about the weather. I kept seeing people talking about ‚Äúliquid sunshine‚Äù, and saying it rains every day but it never lasts long. That was not our experience. We ended up coming at the perfect time. For multiple days before we arrived it was storming according to other guests. As we were leaving we heard there were concerns about a potential incoming hurricane. We got so lucky and only saw rain on 2/6 days we were there. One of those days it rained all night, the other day it only rained a few hours. Unfortunately I think during hurricane season it is very unpredictable. You could end up with more rain than you were hoping for regardless of the people telling you otherwise. If we had arrived only a few days earlier, we would have had more rainy days and potentially not as great of a trip.

We are 26 and 33 years old. We saw many people say this resort is a much older crowd. When we went, we found it to be a good mix of ages. We talked to many other young honeymooners, as well as people celebrating their 10th, 20th, and 30th anniversary. We are not partiers, and we found the vibe to be exactly what we were looking for. 

The food is good if you find what you like and stick with it. We loved the breakfast buffet (especially the omelet station), Lychee, and the beach grill. I‚Äôm a pretty picky eater, and I don‚Äôt eat a lot of seafood. I found that their dishes for lunch and dinner at the buffet were a bit meat heavy. My husband LOVED this. I did not. I wished there had been more options for people who don‚Äôt like meat as much. Even the Mac and cheese had salmon in it. Depending on your preferences, this could be a good or bad thing for you. 

I was very concerned about sand fleas as mosquitoes always love me. I brought 2 different types of bug spray to make sure we didn‚Äôt get bit. I put bug spray on the whole time, my husband didn‚Äôt use it once. We never got a single bite from anything, not even when we sat on the beach at night after it rained. They were not as great of a concern as I imagined they would be. 

The coffee bar was absolutely incredible. Special shoutout to Daneica, she makes the best vanilla latte I‚Äôve ever had. I have an espresso machine at home and was concerned I wouldn‚Äôt be happy with the coffee. It was absolutely delicious and I‚Äôm going to be missing it.

The rooms were nice and very clean. You can tell the property is older and there are some parts that could use some fixing up, but it was still a gorgeous resort. For example, some parts of the pool looked rough. We weren‚Äôt bothered by this as we spent almost all of our time on the beach. 

Okay now for the best part, THE BEACH IS INCREDIBLE!!!!! The water is so, so clear. Imagine purified water out of a bottle clear. The beach is kept in absolutely impeccable condition thanks to the groundsmen of the resort. I always made sure to show appreciation for their work when I saw them. They are incredibly hard workers and do such an amazing job. The sunsets were the most beautiful I have ever seen. I truly could not believe my eyes when I looked at the sky each evening. It is truly the beach of your DREAMS.

Before booking I saw multiple reviews saying the employees are rude and do not always provide good service. My opinion is that those reviews are WRONG. We found that you get what you give with the staff. If you are kind, the staff are so appreciative. I have never seen people respond so positively to simple kindness and respect. One of the main reasons we plan to return to this resort is because of the amazing staff. Getting to know them brought so much joy to our trip. Shaquan brightened my day each time I saw her at the different restaurants. Donna took great care of us each morning at the breakfast buffet. We received the most amazing couples massage from Venecia and Doreen at the spa. Lindon took care of us on many occasions at the Terrace bar, he made us special shots based on our preferences and they were delicious. Denva kept us laughing at the piano bar and remembered our order each time he saw us. My husband and I can‚Äôt wait to go back to see all of our new friends!

Overall we had the most amazing honeymoon, and we cannot wait to come back to Couples Negril!",7,1761017434.0,couplesresortsjamaica,7,1.0,False

1oc2e83,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1oc2e83/e/,E,"Hey,

I wish I could simply talk to you. Writing to you would be so easy in this world. Yet neither of us does it. Maybe our silence has become our armor, our way of protecting ourselves. I‚Äôm so sorry if I disappointed you. I never truly meant for my decision to leave to affect you, or maybe I just didn‚Äôt realize that it would. Looking back, I can feel that it probably did. I tried to tell you, but it was hard, too many thoughts were racing through my mind, and being so close to you somehow numbed me. I also wasn‚Äôt sure if I should tell you, because what we had was never really defined. Imho we weren‚Äôt just colleagues, but we never called ourselves friends either. It was something in between, and that made it even more confusing.

Last week, I ran into a man who caused one of the biggest traumas of my life. He was there with his friends, and I was alone, forced to stand in line right next to them. It was incredibly difficult; I was in shock. I know you would have found the right words to comfort me. That night, I was almost afraid to fall asleep, terrified of what might happen in my dreams. And by chance, I had one of the most beautiful dreams; we were together, having fun, smiling and loving softly, gently enjoying each other‚Äôs company. It felt so real, so peaceful, like the universe was giving me a brief moment of what could have been. It truly helped ease my discomfort and anxiety, just like your presence once did for me.

Even though the pain of our silence fades a little more each day, there are still days when I completely break down, when the ache of your absence feels stronger than ever. I never thought our meeting would touch me so deeply. I keep telling myself that it will eventually fade, that you‚Äôll leave my mind and my heart, but it never happens. And all of that, without even holding hands, kissing, or saying that we loved each other.

I like to believe that I left a mark on you too.. that you found me incredible, and that despite yourself, just like me, you were falling in love. But because of our circumstances, we couldn‚Äôt be together, and through that pain, we chose to ignore each other‚Äôs existence just to forget. But I can‚Äôt forget you. You‚Äôre still in my thoughts and my heart, like pretty much everyday, even when I don‚Äôt want you to be. You give me a kind of spiritual strength. I hope that maybe, weirdly, in some parallel universe, I get to be by your side.

Too often, I wander through Reddit threads, hoping to find a message from you to me. But it‚Äôs never us when I investigate further. I want to leave little clues, because I want you to know deep down, but I‚Äôm afraid of coming across as a crazy, obsessed person.

The last thing you said to me was that we would see each other again. I wish for that more than anything, but the idea also terrifies me. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôd be capable of it anymore. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd finally tell you everything, or if I‚Äôd freeze and run away again.

I wish I was as present in your thoughts as you are in mine, but at the same time, I wouldn‚Äôt wish this kind of painful confusion on anyone. You deserve happiness. I believe you already have it near you. Men tend to see things more simply. You have everything it takes to succeed. Just don‚Äôt forget to follow your instincts, stand your ground and drink plenty of water.

I miss everything about you..your questions, your laugh, your voice, your beautiful brown/hazel eyes, your little clumsy moments that frustrated you, and me standing there watching you, wanting to help, finding you way too adorable.

I hope that a part of you understands that I tried to show my feelings in subtle ways, but I couldn‚Äôt be too obvious, especially since some people had already started making comments. In the long run, it would have become problematic, and I took the hit to protect us.

There‚Äôs so much I would have loved to share about myself, things more real, less superficial, so that you could understand who I am and where I come from. I have to admit, every little thing I discovered about you made me even more interested than before. It took me by surprise..that energy, that divine connection, one in a million. 

All those times I froze in front of you, it happened because I lost my composure and was trying to protect myself. I just felt like you could see right through me..like you could feel and know everything in my mind and soul. It was as if I‚Äôd become completely transparent, telling you everything without saying a single word. 

Anyway, maybe one day I‚Äôll find the courage to send you a message. But if you ever do it before me, I‚Äôd ask you straight away to go for a coffee, because more than anything, I just want the chance to have your presence by my side, even if it‚Äôs only one last time.",3,1761017270.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

I was diagnosed with asthma as a kid. Needed a maintenance inhaler and rescue inhaler as needed until I reached adulthood and moved out of my parents' place away from all the triggers there (dust, mold, cigarette smoke, pet dander). Since then I've been doing well and pretty much only needed to use my rescue inhaler occasionally during allergy seasons. 

Until last month. Out of nowhere, very suddenly, my asthma came back. I have no idea what triggered it. I didn't get sick, I wasn't exposed to any major triggers that I know of, just all of a sudden I started having shortness of breath, chest tightness, and occasional wheezing. 

After reaching the point of having to use my rescue inhaler every 4-6 hours, I went to my PCP and she prescribed fluticasone/salmeterol 2x daily, the lowest dose. 

I'm just so confused as to why this is happening. What is it that could've changed so that my lungs were fine one minute, and suddenly the next they aren't? I have some other health issues that could be contributing. I know I have GERD, which I take a PPI and sometimes also Pepcid for, but I haven't noticed a change in symptoms lately. Maybe LPR? I also suspect that I may have MCAS (due to hypersensitivity to a bunch of substances and a lot of weird allergies in general), but I can't get in to see an allergist until December. Also I've gained some weight so, maybe my belly fat is pushing on my diaphragm? My symptoms seem to be worse first thing in the morning and after meals, no idea what that might mean.

Anyway, has anyone else had their asthma just suddenly appear out of nowhere (or come back) as an adult?

Edit: 

Now that I think about it, there are a couple things that have changed recently with my diet - I recently started drinking coffee and eating wheat/gluten again after not doing so for a while due to gallstones. I'm wondering if either or both of those could be triggering me. If I have a sensitivity to wheat or gluten, I imagine that could definitely trigger some kind of inflammatory reaction in other parts of the body. And as for coffee, I know it's really acidic, so it could be triggering my reflux without me realizing it. I'm thinking maybe I should try eliminating both from my diet for a bit and seeing if that makes any difference.",2,1761017119.0,Asthma,1,1.0,False

3. **Join a silversmithing workshop**¬†‚Äì Design your own ring or pendant with a local artisan. Great keepsake, great story.
4. **Visit AeroXspace Bali or Trans Studio Mall**¬†‚Äì Indoor trampolines, VR, climbing walls, even a theme park. Perfect if you‚Äôre traveling with kids or a kid at heart.
5. **Get creative at Wildart Canggu or a ceramics studio**¬†‚Äì Pottery, batik painting, or sketching while the rain hits the roof. It‚Äôs soothing and productive.
6. **Book a spa day or learn to make your own spa products**¬†‚Äì Book a massage, soak in a flower bath, or take a spa workshop where you learn to make your own scrubs and body oils. It‚Äôs hands-on, smells incredible, and feels like you‚Äôre bottling a piece of Bali to take home.
7. **Try yoga or sound healing**¬†‚Äì Rain outside, gongs and bowls inside. You might fall asleep like I do! 
8. **Take a dance class**¬†‚Äì Balinese dance, salsa, or even K-pop sessions. 
9. **Create your own perfume**¬†‚Äì Blend local ingredients and design your own natural scent to take home.
10. **Train or recover**¬†‚Äì Bali‚Äôs fitness scene is thriving. Try ice baths, compression therapy, or just hit the gym.
11. **Play padel at Liga Tennis**¬†‚Äì Rainy weather? No problem. It‚Äôs fast, fun, and fully indoors.
12. **Just relax**¬†‚Äì Book a long lunch, sip hot coffee, and listen to the rain. Sometimes the best thing to do in Bali is exactly nothing.

And when the thunder rolls and rain hits the tiles, locals smile and say¬†*tidur aja dulu*¬†(just sleep first). Honestly, it‚Äôs a better plan than complaining about the weather! If you want to know which places actually do these experiences well, just ask me. I‚Äôm happy to share the local favorites.

If you‚Äôve been to Bali during the wet season, what did you end up doing? I‚Äôd love to hear what made it memorable for you! ",1,1761017041.0,BaliTravelTips,2,0.6,False
1oc2bgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1oc2bgw/my_now_ex_best_friend_made_me_feel_like_i_was/,My (now ex) best friend made me feel like I was going crazy.,"I (34F) had a best friend ""Kit""  (35f). She was MOH at my wedding last year, so she is in every photo. 

There's a lot of info dump before I tell you the issue, so  I'll try and keep your attention - it's all relevant I promise. I know the chronology might be a bit all over the place too, sorry in advance. 

There is a lot of venting because I'm just at a loss of what to do. 

My best friend of 8 years and our husbands are that couple that always hangs out together. She had been with her husband for 7 years and mine got 4. We lived 300m away from each other by the beach for 1.5 years so we would hang out every single weekend. We would get wasted on Friday night then be too hungover the rest of the weekend, but we had some fun times. 

My husband and I bought a house about 25 minutes away in the suburbs, and we also naturally didn't want to get drunk every weekend, we had things to do. I am a full time student (on my last term of uni finally!), my husband's family pretty well off and he has a trust fund that he used to buy the house and his family also helped him buy the house - so there is no mortgage. Which being the second most unaffordable city in the world, you know that's a huge weight off of our shoulders. 

My husband was a surgeon back in Europe, but came here to do a PhD and changed his direction in health. He made good money, nothing crazy, considering we are still living off of one income. 

6 months before the wedding, my dad cheated on my mum and left her for the other woman and left my mother with my autistic sister who is going through the worst of the worst domestic abuse situations. She was forced to have 2 children with this guy and they are non verbal autistic, so it is very hard for her. My father also cut my mother off financially, so that also adds to it. I told my husband I want to post pone the wedding but he wouldn't allow it as we had his family coming from over seas. So the entire year I was depressed and my father ended up coming to the wedding and leaving half way through. 

My husband had a great time with his family, but to me it was probably the one of the most depressing days of my life. My friend knew I didn't want to do it. 

Some more family drama followed which just added to the anxiety. 

After the wedding, she went quiet in the group chat then called me to tell me that everyone in our friend group is angry with me because of how I have been the last few months. 

I contacted every person individually and said sorry I have been so stressed out and please forgive me. Every single person said 'it's totally fine and why would they be mad at me? Weddings are stressful and everyone had a great time.' And essentially proved she was lying. 

She told me I wasn't myself and I need to go seek help and get anti depressants, so I did. After 3 months I stopped taking them as I felt like the shock of the wedding was over. 

After many sessions in counselling, my husband apologised for making me go through with the wedding and was just so excited. 

Fast forward 8 months. I am still a poor student. I'm still feeling a bit depressed after the previous year. I dropped a few subjects at uni and did some short courses in my field of study (work health safety). I spent all of my savings on these courses, then everything else I spent on my husband's birthday party - all in the same month. So I maxed out my credit card and burned through my savings, but he had a great time with everyone. 

After a massive day on a difficult course, I went home and took a sleeping tablet at 7pm and woke up at 9am the next day. I needed a long sleep. 

I was in bed replying to messages, then I started getting ready for the day - taking my dog to the vet then going to my other friend's house to help her start packing to move the following weekend. 

Another friend, we will call ""Kayla"" (35f) managed a liquor store. We met her 8 months prior when we got our alcohol into her store. (My husband and I invested 10% into Kit and husbands alcholo company). I put 15% of the 10% as that's all I could afford, he put the remainder. But to make it simple, he signed it for us. 

When we had our start up, I was running around doing everything Kit asked of me so we could get it off the ground. Often driving 4-5 hours a day to pick up and deliver things. Do alcohol tastings for them (takes several hours) all unpaid because 1) I'm an investor and 2) they're my friends and I want them to succeed. 

For 2.5 years they would always introduce me as ""this is (my name), her husband is an investor"". And I would always say ""well, we both are..."". 

I told kit that it hurt my feelings when her husband did this and why was I not in the ""alcohol"" group chat? She said it's just for the ""signatories"". Whatever, I gave that up. I changed my mindset and thought maybe I'll help because it's my best friend. And for the following year I was happy to live with that mindset. 

So fast forward - we meet Kayla at the liquor store, I do a tasting as Kit keeps leaving to do things. So I‚Äôm mostly by myself. I also helped run around and get everything for the Mardi Gras celebration in the area that month. 

For the last 2 years I have been waiting for my work experience subject at uni. Because my friend and her husband work in construction, they promised they could get me some work experience when the time came. She works in administration, her husband is a project manager - they don't work together, they met through a work friend. But it's important to note that she has always said ""I don't know how you can study so much, I tried once and it's not for me"". 

Since I've know Kit, I've been the fun drinking friend on the weekends. I've had my fair share of weird guys that she saw in the first few years of our friendship and I‚Äôm always doing something crazy, I have had a fun life I guess you could say. 

I made good money throughout my 20s so it took a lot of adjusting to become a broke student. (Yes, I had savings, but that ran out by the time we had the wedding). 

When I first met her, she just left her fianc√© as his mistress just gave birth to their child and he left her with $90k debt. 

I paid for everything when we went out because I was in a position to do so. I never keep tabs on my friends (when I'm actually working). Money comes and goes. As a student, I now account for every dollar haha. 

But one day I grew up, i knuckled down with my studies, I found a great man (albeit the wedding situation was bad). He is a Dr - if that matters to other people, not to me. It's impressive of course, but I guess he liked that I never made our relationship about his achievements like the women before me. 

It's been 6 -7 years of studying, thanks to the world shutting down for two years. 

So now that you've got the foundations, let's get to the story! 

It's been 6 months since Mardi Gras, 6 months of friendship with Kayla. As I don't live near the beach/ cbd anymore, I don't go out much. I've been knuckling down on my studies as it's my last year. Kit and Kayla (in real life they have similar names) have been hanging out every Friday night. We have all been to each other's birthdays, we all like each other.  

It's the day after I took the sleeping tablet, I wake up at 9am, I'm taking my dog to the vet for a minor issue, then off to another friend's place to help her pack for her upcoming move. So I‚Äôm emptying out the car, putting in boxes etc. 

Kayla had messaged the night before with a discount code to some designer brand. I replied with ""I wish I could, but I‚Äôm so broke after June"" (my short courses, husband's birthday etc - around $6k). 

She replies with ""if you're desperate, I can give you 2 shifts at my store."" Great! I thought. 2 days and I will fill in when someone calls in sick. That way it's not too much of a commitment as I have a busy month coming up. 

I message Kit back in the group chat to apologise for my late response as I had a sleeping tablet the previous night. She replied with ""or you were out drinking with Kayla haha"". I reply with ""that's so funny you mention her as she just offered me to do 2 shifts at her store this weekend and a fill in person in the future"". 

I mention I did my truck license the day before and she replied with that will be handy for future events for alcohol company. 

At this point - it has been 30 minutes since Kayla offered me the job and me telling Kit. 

I'm packing the car as I‚Äôm replying to everyone. I leave, Kayla messages to ask if I want to work that night as well as the other 2. I say sure. 

I get to the shop that evening and start working. Kayla tells me she is going out with Kit that night. Kit comes in, in a hurry as the uber is outside, drops me my sunglasses from the hangout the previous weekend. Doesn't say hi, just in a rush. Nothing out of the ordinary, she gets stressed when she's in a rush. 

I send 2 photos in the group chat over the weekend. Radio silence. 

Come Monday morning, I'm back on an intense short course. 10 hours per day, plus 4-5 hours homework each night for two weeks. 

I message to ask her and her husband they still have a connection for me for work experience in safety still, otherwise I can organise something else. 

She replies with ""you've been changing your mind a lot lately with what you want to do with work experience so maybe you should have a long hard think about what it is you actually want to do before chats can be had."" 

I thought this was quite rude. After the wedding we agreed if the other person does something we would say it straight away so there is no build up. 

So I message her asking why she said that when my degree I've been studying for 6 years is in safety and she agreed 2 years ago to help me and I have asked them every 6 months since then if they can still help and it's not a big deal if they can't. I have other options. And also that it was rude to put in the group chat. 

She said ""I'll call you later tonight"". 

So she calls, I answer pleasantly as usual thinking she is going to say ""sorry, I didn't mean it like that, I've just had a rough week.""

Instead - she goes off her head at me saying I should have asked her permission to work at the liquor store, I shouldn't be telling people I am broke as I am an investor and it looks bad for the business and she had to hear it from someone else that I took the job. Also saying that Kayla was confused why we lived in such an expensive house but I was saying I was poor - she took my address from my employee application and looked the house price up. How is that anything to do with me? Plus - once again, I have a prenup because his family bought the house. 

She also said Kayla is not our friend. She is a work colleague and they only go out with her every Friday to try to get her to get out alcohol into other stores. I said that's not nice to her considering that we've all been to each other's   birthdays as I had considered Kayla my friend. 

She said I wouldn't understand because I don't work in that business. Which - why even invite me to events then? 

I was so confused, but also - why are you yelling? 
Why didn't you say something Friday? Or Saturday? Or Sunday? Or Monday morning? I could have avoided even starting work if it meant that much to her. 

Plus - this is the first time I've been included as an investor. Why now? After the last year we've been saying I just work for her. 

We end the phone-call. I'm so angry. I tell my husband and all he hears is that I have been telling people I‚Äôm poor and he is not a good provider, when all I said was ""I can't afford designer clothes because I am a student and just had an expensive month"". Is this the wrong thing to say? 

I didn't get much care from him as he was hung up on that sentence. He did try, but it's a trigger for him to not be a good provider. 

He called her husband the next day to ask what was going on. He said Kit said ""apparently she told her not to work there and she took the job anyway"". Which is a lie. 

Then the manager from the other liquor store dies. That's her husbands friend and how we got into Kayla's liquor store. 

So I send her a nice message saying sorry for the loss of her friend etc. 

Then come Friday. She loses her job. 

She messaged Sunday saying let's clear the air. I figure let's not make my birthday awkward and we meet up a few days later/ the day before my birthday. 

I figure she has had a rough week and it's not with losing the friendship over. I'll apologise for all of these things and she will apologise for overreacting. 

I say sorry for xyz.... 

She also says she doesn't actually care that I work there, just that Kayla told her first. I said ""but I told you half hour after"" she said ""yes, but Kayla told me first! You should have dropped everything you were doing and told me!""

I ask her for an apology for what she said and she replies with ""well first you want to be a bus driver, then you want to do a truck license, then you want to won't this place etc etc. so you see where I'm coming from?""

I replied ""not really... what I do for a job and what I do for study and a career are two different things. I could be an uber driver or work at a coffee shop and that has nothing to do with my degree in work safety"" 

She replies ""I guess this is a conversation for another day"". 

I also mention the alcohol group chat - again she says it's just for those who signed the contract. So I decided I‚Äôm not doing anything more for that business regardless of how this pans out. 

My husband takes me out for my birthday over the weekend and ""surprises me"" with her and her husband. It was the worst birthday ever. He thought we had a little disagreement and now we're over it. I guess he thought that too. 

For the entire Month my husband, her husband and Kit had a group chat organising meet ups as I was too busy with study. I told him please don't do this it hurts my feelings. He said I will get over it and I just need another chat with her to clear the air. She messaged me 1-2 weeks later to catch up as friends, not for any hard conversations and I told her it seems like she has forgotten where we left things. 

She is not willing to apologise. Her husband obviously has been told a different story. We had a few back and forth texts, but she doesn't think she did anything wrong. 

I told my husband I‚Äôm not going on his family vacation anymore as I don't feel heard or supported. He said I'm being dramatic, but I stood my ground. 

He spoke to the counsellor and told them what was happening and he agreed he had been a dick the last month by not realising the argument was bigger than it actually was. 

I quit the liquor store job for Kit- (Kayla wanted to keep me on permanently). 

My husband doesn't speak to them anymore, but keeps it cordial with them because of the business. 

I blocked her, I can't let that friendship take any more energy from me. 

I am graduating in a few short months, I have my dream job back in my husband's country as we are moving there soon for his work. 

I don't know what to do from here. Did I make the right choice? I feel better that I blocked her, but I also have other friends asking if I was going to her birthday - which was kind of the straw that broke the camels back as she organised her birthday when we were in a good place. 

Some say it's obvious that she is jealous as she was always the one I turned to for advice and she was always ahead of me in life. But now my life is about to take off - house, husband, career, money. It seems like she doesn't think I deserve it because she met me when I was the ""funny drunk friend"" but I turned my life around - it has not been easy. But she is still going out getting drunk every Friday night. 

I've always been the chill friend who lets things slide, but this time I didn't. Maybe that has shocked her?

When I reached class, Penny was already scrolling through her phone, giggling.
‚ÄúLook, Amy! It‚Äôs everywhere!‚Äù she said, showing me a post ‚Äî dozens of photos from social media, all captioned:

> ‚ÄòMud Queen Smoothie Challenge ‚Äî Stay Cool, Stay Colorful!‚Äô



And there she was ‚Äî Carmen, the one who posted them first! She stood at the front of the class holding her phone like a reporter.
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she announced dramatically, ‚Äúit‚Äôs official ‚Äî the smoothie trend has begun!‚Äù

Everyone crowded around her as she swiped through the photos: people holding rainbow-colored smoothies, smiling, posing at caf√©s, beaches, even at the mall. The funniest part? They were all mimicking the poses from The Adventures of the Mud Queen Episode 3!

Kira laughed so hard she nearly dropped her pencil case.
‚ÄúThey actually copied the show! Look ‚Äî even the tongue pose!‚Äù
Winfrey, ever the novelist, said, ‚ÄúSee? Art inspires life! The Mud Queen‚Äôs message of ‚Äòfun over perfection‚Äô spreads again.‚Äù

Even our teacher, Mrs. Bloom, peeked curiously at the photos and chuckled.
‚ÄúI guess being colorful is fashionable now,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt try it during class, alright?‚Äù

After recess, Carmen whispered to me, ‚ÄúYou know, Amy, everyone‚Äôs calling this the Smoothie Revolution. Maybe we should join in before it‚Äôs old news!‚Äù
Penny gasped. ‚ÄúYes! Let‚Äôs make our own version ‚Äî The SisterBean Blend!‚Äù

We spent lunch planning it ‚Äî fruity drinks, matching color layers, and maybe even a Coffee Day twist.
Winfrey promised to write a little story to go with the post, about friendship and summer smoothies.

By the time school ended, my notifications were full of new tags:

> #MudQueenSmoothieChallenge
#SisterBeanCrew
#StayColorfulStayHappy



On the way home, I showed the posts to Mom. She just shook her head, laughing.
‚ÄúYou girls start a new trend every week,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFirst mud, then coffee, now smoothies. What‚Äôs next, Amy?‚Äù
I giggled. ‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôll invent glow-in-the-dark milk tea next!‚Äù

Mom sighed playfully. ‚ÄúAs long as it doesn‚Äôt end up on your belly again.‚Äù

It started as the acorns started falling from the Live Oak above my cabin. They would fall on the tin roof, making a gentle rolling sound as they fell to the ground.  
  
It wasn't long before a family of squirrels moved in. I could hear them scurrying around the crawl space, storing acorns for winter.  
  
This Saturday morning as I was drinking my coffee, I saw one fine young Squirell emerge from it's burrow and climb onto my deck in perfect viewing range of my front window. (He was about 4' away, but the window separated us)I watched, as the little thing squinted against the morning sun and then did the cutest stretch I've ever seen... In that moment, I felt I could relate to this Squirell. Just two beings, existing in the same space and time, getting ready to face the day.  
  
Growing up in the country, we would hunt (and eat) Squirell, Deer, Dove etc.. It really made me consider the morality of hunting and meat consumption. I've always respected the life of the animal and the sacrifice it made for me to have a meal, but this moment really made me question if it's something I want to continue.  
  
So I ponder on these things and the suffering I've caused these critters until Sunday (last night) rolls around.I'm dead asleep, and I hear the unmistakable sound of a rattler... A serpent has slithered in, come to disturb me and my family of Squirrels.I spend the rest of the night in and out of sleep as I worry about the squirrels, and that rattler getting in. (I live in a wooden cabin out in the sticks, which is why I was able to hear it so clearly through the floor)  
  
This morning there is no squirrels in my yard, and tonight when I returned home from work I don't hear them scurrying around. I hope they made it out safe, but I fear the worst. Now it's just silence here at the cowboy cabin....I can't help but to hate the rattler, for disturbing my peace, my Squirells and causing me anxiety that he's going to get in here. I'd like to make a hat band out of his ass.  
  
But am I not like the rattler? I have hunted my whole life, doing exactly what I am hating him for.  
Is he so wrong for needing a meal?  
  
Then my pondering turns to wether I want to be a rattler, whose existence depends on the death of another. Or a Squirell. Taking only what he needs from the plants around him (I am talking about a vegetarian diet)I think I know MY answer. But at the end of the day, neither of it's right or wrong. It's just life. The tree of life. Starting with an acorn, and ending with one mans existential searching.",1,1761016606.0,Life,1,1.0,False

I love her and this is by far the healthiest relationship I‚Äôve had and I‚Äôm sure she would say the same. I‚Äôm at a point in my life where I‚Äôve moved states multiple times for work and I‚Äôve worked my way up my company. She goes to school online at the moment because my job gave her the opportunity to. When we first started getting serious I told her my goal is to be able to support all of us while she handles the homemaker stuff. Of course I told her I don‚Äôt want it to detriment any of her goals like school or apprenticeship or anything she mentioned but with us being young and not having kids but two pets; it‚Äôs not a lot of work to keep up with our home. She agreed and at first she was stern on working but after a while she ended up getting scammed and lost her job ( different story) and I was totally supportive and told her to take her time finding something. She deciding she wanted to get a specific medical license since she never had the time or opportunity before and we agreed on the plan. I will mention right now even before she lost her job she struggled doing any chores around the house which I usually just picked up after my day. At first I was I was totally understanding but after a while it started to bother me because it felt like she wasn‚Äôt keeping up with her side of the deal. I work a job that consists of a lot of driving , manual labor and meetings and I‚Äôve always felt that necessary chores need to be done before fully relaxing so I‚Äôve always done that. She worked at a coffee shop and would say she‚Äôs too tired to do them which like I said I would understand and pick up any chores that were not done then shower and then cook. Which I don‚Äôt mind cause I like my own cooking a lot but it does get to me when I expect it at times after a hard day. After she lost her job and was going to school on the computer , it‚Äôs she‚Äôs too busy to do anything . I‚Äôm very much a person that loves routines And I came into the relationship with a dog and he‚Äôs a schedule . I would write down the schedules , send reminders and she just wouldn‚Äôt take him out until 6 hours after and he‚Äôs having accidents because of it. I‚Äôve had talks with her about it and she said she‚Äôll do better and be on it more but more recently I don‚Äôt really hear about her doing school besides when I ask or if she‚Äôs doing an hour of work on a Saturday. I feel like I constantly have to remind her about things that I don‚Äôt want to. I feel bad because I feel like a part of her is trying but idk if she just didn‚Äôt grow up cleaning a lot or cooking but it will take a whole two weeks to do fold and put away one load of laundry. Sometimes I feel like maybe it‚Äôs just the way I was raised. Single dad household and I came home from school,go to football, do chores , workout and study . I had a whole list of chores I would have to do by the eod. She‚Äôs from a two parent household with a sibling so idk if she just didnt do alot of cleaning or cooking but i feel like a dick because she does support me in terms of loving on me and my job and when I do need my recoup she knows exactly what I need. I think it comes with me thinking so far down the line too. Like it‚Äôs hard for me to see myself 35 years old and dealing with anything similar of when I come home from working 10-12 hours the house is dirty , she‚Äôs laying in the same spot, no dinner , my dog isn‚Äôt taken care of properly and living with them. And thinking it makes no sense to fully support them.  But then I tell myself she supports me and cares for me and she‚Äôs 100% loyal and everything. Typing it seems like a low bar now but she really is a good girl , I just think she lacks in those areas that are important to me. At times I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm being too harsh because she‚Äôs learning and stuff but I‚Äôve brought it up so many times I‚Äôm not sure. If it was anyone else I‚Äôd be feeling really disrespected but I‚Äôm just feeling confused right now. I want to summarize that I love her and have no ill will or anything just confusion.

We are a family of 4 from Florida that visited Quebec last year and had an amazing time. During this visit, we stayed in Mont Tremblant and put our 6 year old in ski lessons for only 1 day. She loved it and talks about it often. To this day, both my wife and I have never been on skis but we are highly interested and intrigued; we never got the chance at Mont Tremblant because we had a 1 year old to care for.

However, we had such a great time altogether because of the layout of Mont Tremblant. We could walk out of our hotel to eat dinner at a restaurant, go shopping, just walk around and explore, grab a drink, ride the ski lift or cabriolet as passengers only, sit next to an open fire drinking coffee, enjoy the hot tub, and on and on.

We want to repeat a similar trip but maybe save money on flights and hotels coming from Florida. Was our experience unique to how Mont Tremblant is setup or this just how most ski resorts are?

1oc1xmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/backrooms/comments/1oc1xmm/level_389_the_flight_that_never_lands/,Level 389: The Flight That Never Lands,"When David opened his eyes, he was already buckled in.

The cabin lights were dim, a weak amber glow filtering through the overhead panels. Outside the window, there was nothing‚Äîno stars, no sky, just an endless sheet of gray, like fog pressed flat against glass. He couldn‚Äôt remember boarding, or buying a ticket, or even deciding to travel. He only knew that the seatbelt sign was on, and the plane was humming steadily beneath him.

He waited for the usual announcement. Nothing came.

Across the aisle, three seats sat empty except for a folded blanket and a tray of untouched peanuts. The air felt heavy, recycled too many times, full of that metallic airplane scent‚Äîstale coffee, aluminum, and faint jet fuel. David pressed the button for the flight attendant. The soft ding echoed through the silence, unanswered.

After a while, he stood up.

The rest of the cabin looked normal enough‚Äîrows of economy seats, seatback screens frozen mid-advertisement, ‚ÄúWelcome aboard‚Ä¶‚Äù looping silently. As he walked down the aisle, the carpet squished faintly under his shoes, though it was perfectly dry. Each step felt slightly delayed, as if the air were thick, resisting him.

He turned toward the galley. The curtain that separated it from the main cabin was drawn halfway. On the other side, something moved‚Äîa tall figure, maybe a woman, arranging silver trays in slow, deliberate motions. David cleared his throat.

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

The figure stopped but didn‚Äôt turn around.

‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ wanted to know how long until we land,‚Äù he said.

No answer. The air suddenly filled with a soft static hiss, and the intercom crackled.

 ‚Äú...ladies and gentlemen... we‚Äôll be arriving shortly... please remain...‚Äù

The voice dissolved into static again. When he looked back toward the galley, the figure was gone.

David backed up, his heartbeat rising. Maybe it was turbulence, maybe he‚Äôd fallen asleep on a real flight and was dreaming. That had to be it.

He turned to head back to his seat‚Äîbut the aisle stretched longer than before. The exit signs glowed dimly red at the far end, impossibly far. He walked faster. Rows kept passing: 22A, 22B, 23A, 23B... then 22 again. Then 21. Then 22.

He stopped, breathing hard. The engines droned at a low, constant pitch that didn‚Äôt sound like flight anymore‚Äîmore like a generator buried somewhere deep inside the walls.

Someone coughed behind him.

David turned. A man sat by the window three rows back. He hadn‚Äôt been there before. He wore a gray business suit, his face hidden behind the headrest. David hesitated.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he said, his voice trembling slightly. ‚ÄúDo you know what‚Äôs going on? We‚Äôve been‚Äî‚Äù

The man turned his head. His face was expressionless, pale as paper. His eyes didn‚Äôt blink. His mouth opened slightly, but no sound came out‚Äîonly the distant echo of the intercom, repeating a single phrase, distorted and slow:

 ‚Äú...fasten seatbelts... fasten seatbelts... fasten seatbelts...‚Äù

The lights flickered once, twice, then dimmed to red emergency glow. David stumbled backward, nearly tripping over an armrest. The sound of the engines shifted‚Äîhigher now, almost whining. The windows began to darken, the fog outside thickening until even the faint light disappeared.

He ran toward the cockpit. The aisle looped again. When he reached the front, he found himself back by the lavatories, the same peeling safety poster on the door. A low voice whispered behind him, close to his ear.

‚ÄúPlease return to your seat.‚Äù

He spun around. The flight attendant stood there, tall and thin, her uniform spotless, her face stretched in a smile too wide, too fixed. Her eyes were calm, almost kind.

‚ÄúWhere is this plane going?‚Äù he managed to ask.

Her smile didn‚Äôt waver. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre already here,‚Äù she said softly.

The intercom clicked again, and a new announcement began, this time clear and slow, the captain‚Äôs voice impossibly close:

‚ÄúThank you for flying with us. We hope you enjoy your stay.‚Äù

The engines stopped.
Everything went silent.

David looked down the aisle‚Äîrows of passengers now filled every seat, sitting perfectly still, facing forward.
Their heads all turned toward him at once.

He tried to scream, but the seatbelt sign flicked on with a soft chime.

""...Please remain seated until the next flight begins.""",2,1761015896.0,backrooms,0,1.0,False
1oc1xaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oc1xaw/under_the_linen/,Under the Linen,"

The body came in on a Tuesday.

It was wrapped in gray bandages the color of dry ash, bundled tight as if the linen itself had clenched into a fist. Two men from the British Museum‚Äôs antiquities exchange wheeled it through the service door under a thin white tarp, though you could still see the vague human shape beneath. Arms rigid to the sides. Feet close together. Head slightly tilted, as if listening.

They told us it had no catalogue number. No name. No provenance.
‚ÄúPrivate acquisition,‚Äù one of them said, adjusting his gloves. ‚ÄúBe careful with it. The curator called it The Nameless One.‚Äù

The crate smelled of rot and dust ‚Äî not the sweet, hollow smell of old paper, but something denser, meatier. A smell that clung to the inside of your nose like blood. We signed the delivery papers, wheeled it into the conservation lab, and left it under the soft glow of the halogen lamps. The sound of the casters on the tile echoed too loud in that room.

That was my first night alone with it.

‚∏ª

I‚Äôm not supposed to be here past midnight ‚Äî union rules, security procedures, all that ‚Äî but I‚Äôve never been good at leaving things alone. I‚Äôm an assistant conservator, meaning I‚Äôm the one who scrapes the tar off the sarcophagi, brushes sand from the hieroglyphs, rebinds the linen. I clean the dead for a living.

So when they wheeled The Nameless One in and the others went home, I stayed. I wanted to see it unwrapped.

The linen was layered like onion skin, hardened by resin into a brittle shell. Under the light it looked almost translucent, with veins of brown where ancient oils had bled through. I lifted a corner near the neck with tweezers, expecting the usual ‚Äî dust, maybe a patch of shriveled skin.

Instead, the bandage pulsed.

Just once. A subtle, almost imperceptible shiver. Like a muscle twitch.

I froze, leaning in close enough to hear the fabric rasp against itself. Nothing. I told myself it was static, air displacement, nerves. The brain does that ‚Äî it fills the silence with movement. Still, I covered the body again and stepped back.

But I couldn‚Äôt leave.

The lab was cold enough to sting my fingers, but the closer I got to the mummy, the warmer the air felt ‚Äî like the heat bleeding from a sleeping dog. The tarp rose ever so slightly near the chest. I thought I imagined it until the faintest creak of linen echoed beneath.

Then something let out a sigh.

It wasn‚Äôt breath, not really. More like a release of air trapped for centuries, long enough to take on a voice. The bandages shifted, and a puff of dust lifted from the wrappings and curled toward the light like smoke. The room smelled suddenly wet ‚Äî the scent of clay and decay and something faintly metallic.

I stumbled back, heart pounding, and hit the switch that powered the overhead lamps.

For a second, as the fluorescents flickered, I saw something beneath the linen move ‚Äî a ripple from chest to throat, like a small animal tunneling upward. Then the light stabilized, and it was gone.

‚∏ª

When I reported it the next morning, Dr. Halvorsen laughed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been breathing too much desiccant powder,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThese things settle at night. Air pockets collapse. Perfectly normal.‚Äù

But he didn‚Äôt come into the lab to check. No one wanted to be in that room longer than necessary.

By the second night, the smell had grown worse ‚Äî sweet and fungal. I found myself drawn back anyway, as if something in the air pressed at the base of my skull and tugged me toward the table. The tarp still covered the body, but it looked different now: tighter around the limbs, more defined. Like the thing underneath had swelled.

I told myself I‚Äôd just document it. I took photos from every angle ‚Äî feet, hands, chest, skull. In one of the images, the linen over the face looked slightly torn near the mouth. When I zoomed in, there was something beneath: the edge of a lip, black and shriveled, pulled taut in what looked almost like a smile.

That‚Äôs when I heard the soft, wet tearing sound.

It came from beneath the tarp, slow and deliberate. The sound of resin cracking, linen parting.

I lifted the cover.

The bandages around the torso had split open, but there was no dust, no rot ‚Äî only slick, dark tissue glistening beneath, gloved in some kind of tarry residue. Not embalming resin. This was fresh. Wet. And it moved.

The surface quivered like jelly as I leaned closer. Beneath it, I could see something pushing upward, pressing against the skin, then slipping back down as if burrowing deeper.

I dropped the scalpel and backed away until I hit the counter. I should have called security. I should have run. But instead I stood there, hypnotized, watching the ripples crawl beneath the bandages like trapped eels.

Then everything went still again.

For a long time, nothing moved.

‚∏ª

I told myself I was losing it. Lack of sleep. Too many late nights in sterile rooms. I went home and showered for nearly an hour, but even then I could smell it ‚Äî that faint, sweet rot curling up from my hands.

By morning, I was shaking with fever.

I told the others I‚Äôd caught something from the storage area ‚Äî dust fever, maybe, or spores from the tomb artifacts. They laughed again, but I saw how they looked at me. How they leaned back as if my breath carried something contagious.

That night, I found myself outside the museum again without remembering how I got there. The service door was unlocked.

The body was waiting.

‚∏ª

It looked‚Ä¶ different.

The linen had receded somehow, curling inward like skin around a wound. The face was more visible now ‚Äî the bandages frayed around the cheeks and mouth, revealing the hard gleam of dried gums and teeth the color of old ivory. The lips had cracked wide open in a permanent rictus.

I leaned in and smelled the breath of the tomb.

There was a whispering sound then ‚Äî not from the mouth, but from everywhere at once, like hundreds of dry leaves shifting in a wind that didn‚Äôt exist. My ears popped. The room went cold. And I realized it wasn‚Äôt air I was hearing. It was words.

A language too old for the brain to hold, murmured beneath the linen.

My nose began to bleed.

I turned away, clutching my face, and when I looked back, something black and wet was seeping from the corners of the mummy‚Äôs mouth ‚Äî not liquid, exactly. More like threads. They wavered in the air, thin as silk, reaching toward me as if drawn by the heat of my breath.

When one of them brushed my wrist, it burned cold.

I stumbled backward, knocking over a tray of tools. The thread snapped and curled away, retracting into the mummy‚Äôs mouth. For a second, I thought I saw the jaw twitch. Then silence again.

I left the museum at dawn, trembling. My car smelled of dust and iron. I could still feel that touch on my wrist hours later ‚Äî a faint cold pulsing under the skin, like something nesting there.

‚∏ª

By the fourth day, the infection had spread. My arm throbbed beneath the sleeve, veins darkening like ink drawn beneath the skin. I tried to ignore it, but when I pressed my fingers to the spot, something moved ‚Äî something small and alive, curling away deeper into the muscle.

I wrapped my arm in gauze and went back to work.

I couldn‚Äôt stay away. Every night I‚Äôd tell myself I wouldn‚Äôt go near the lab, and every night I‚Äôd find myself standing over that table again, staring at the linen as it seemed to breathe.

The whispers came more clearly now. Sometimes they formed shapes, syllables, half-remembered prayers. I started to understand fragments: names, places, pleas. And one word that repeated over and over, a hiss that rolled like sand through my skull ‚Äî ‚ÄúLenen-kh.‚Äù

Under the linen.

‚∏ª

That was when the lights began to fail.

They flickered in rhythm with my heartbeat. Sometimes the bulbs would dim until the only light left was the faint, golden glow from the mummy‚Äôs open mouth. I swear I saw movement inside ‚Äî like insects writhing over bone.

I dreamed of it constantly. I‚Äôd wake in my bed to find the sheets wound around me like bandages, my own skin slick with sweat. I‚Äôd taste salt and dust in my mouth, and the whisper would still be there, speaking from somewhere beneath the floor.

By then, the others noticed something was wrong.
‚ÄúYou look pale,‚Äù Halvorsen said one morning, his eyes darting to my wrist. ‚ÄúAre you sleeping?‚Äù

I wanted to tell him everything. I opened my mouth ‚Äî and a puff of gray dust spilled out instead of words.

That‚Äôs when I knew it wasn‚Äôt just under my skin anymore.

The infection had no fever anymore.
Only a quiet rhythm, a pulse under the skin that didn‚Äôt belong to me.

It began to change the way things felt. The air in the museum grew heavy, thick as syrup, every breath tasting faintly of copper and ash. The exhibits seemed to lean inward when I passed, the glass reflections no longer quite matching my movements. The mummy‚Äôs gallery, closed to the public, had become its own climate ‚Äî warmer, somehow, even though the thermostat read forty-nine degrees.

I told myself it was the lights. Or a hallucination.
But then I noticed the dust didn‚Äôt fall straight anymore. It drifted toward the table, drawn like iron filings to a magnet.

And the linen‚Ä¶ breathed.

‚∏ª

It was subtle at first ‚Äî a ripple through the fabric, as though exhaled from somewhere deep beneath the resin-hardened folds. Each breath came a little faster than the last, syncing with my heartbeat. I stood over it, hypnotized, until I realized that it was my chest that was matching its rhythm. I tried to slow my breathing, but it dragged me back into its pace, the way the tide drags a swimmer out to sea.

Then I saw the thread.

A single strand of linen had come loose near the mummy‚Äôs wrist. It floated upward, trembling, as though weightless. I reached toward it ‚Äî and it reached back. The fabric twisted in the air, catching on my hand, and for a split second it seemed to dissolve into warmth ‚Äî not cloth at all but skin, whisper-thin, alive.

I yanked my hand away. The strand snapped back, curling onto the table like a living thing.

The spot on my wrist throbbed again. The skin there had turned pale, almost translucent, veins like dark roots beneath the surface. And when I brushed a fingertip over it, I felt the faintest tug from beneath ‚Äî as though something inside was listening.

‚∏ª

I started hearing them at night.
Not the words this time, but the breathing ‚Äî faint, rhythmic, echoing through the vents.

The sound filled my dreams. I‚Äôd find myself standing in endless corridors of glass cases, each one holding bodies wrapped in linen that pulsed gently like sleeping lungs. The air shimmered with heat, my mouth full of dust, and in the far corner, a figure stood unwrapped ‚Äî tall, thin, its face lost beneath layers of shadow. When it turned, I woke gasping.

Every time I woke, I found a few new specks of sand in my bed.

‚∏ª

By the end of that week, the museum smelled different. The air was stale, yet alive, like soil that had just been turned. My coworkers began to notice too.
‚ÄúHumidity‚Äôs off,‚Äù Halvorsen muttered, checking the sensors. ‚ÄúFifty-six percent. Impossible. The dehumidifiers haven‚Äôt stopped once.‚Äù

I watched as he touched the mummy‚Äôs tarp, frowning.
‚ÄúThis thing‚Äôs sweating,‚Äù he said, half-joking, and pulled his hand back.

There was a faint residue on his glove ‚Äî a clear film, almost oily. He wiped it off, but the mark stayed, darkening the latex until it looked burned.

That night, he didn‚Äôt go home. He locked himself in his office, and by morning, he was gone. His badge was still in the reader, his coffee still steaming on the desk. The security footage showed him walking down the hall toward the conservation lab just before two a.m., the door closing behind him.

No one ever saw him come out.

They sealed the lab for investigation. I was the only one who had a key.

‚∏ª

I told myself I‚Äôd go in one last time.
Just to see.

Inside, the air pressed down on me like a hand. My breath fogged, though the air was warm. The tarp was gone.

The mummy lay uncovered on the table ‚Äî or what remained of it.
The linen had darkened to a color between smoke and gold, clinging to a shape that was no longer strictly human. The arms were crossed, but the shoulders had shifted subtly wider, the chest risen higher, as though the body beneath had begun to draw breath of its own again. The mouth gaped slightly, threads of something fine and wet hanging between the teeth like spun glass.

And there, in the hollow of its collarbone, was a patch of skin that looked new. Pink. Fresh.

My knees went weak.

When I leaned closer, I could feel it breathing against my face ‚Äî faint, but steady. The same rhythm that had been echoing through my dreams. The same rhythm under my own ribs.

I reached out. The air between us hummed like static. My fingertips hovered over the new skin, and it was warm ‚Äî unmistakably warm.

Then I heard a sound that made my bones ache: the sound of fabric shifting, slow and deliberate, as the linen began to unwind itself.

The first strip lifted free from the chest, rising like smoke, spinning slowly in the still air. Another followed. Then another. They twisted together, forming a pattern in the air like script I almost understood. The whispers surged up again, all around me, inside me, the syllables ancient and intimate. My mouth moved without permission, shaping the same sounds back.

And that‚Äôs when the lights went out.

‚∏ª

In the dark, I felt it ‚Äî something soft brushing my cheek. The smell of old resin and myrrh flooded the room.
I turned on my phone‚Äôs light, the beam catching a flash of movement. The linen was no longer on the table. It hung in the air around me like a swarm of ribbons, floating, turning, breathing.

When I stepped back, they followed.

A single strip wrapped gently around my wrist, the same one where the mark had spread. It tightened slightly ‚Äî not enough to hurt, just enough to anchor. My pulse beat against it, and it pulsed back in rhythm. Then another strand brushed my neck, another my chest, until I stood cocooned in that ancient air, the linen hovering inches from my skin.

I couldn‚Äôt move. The whispers grew louder, a chorus now, layered and deep, rising from the walls themselves. I saw shapes in the darkness ‚Äî figures behind the glass, eyes gleaming from the other exhibits, as though the dead were waking to watch.

The linen pressed closer. Warm. Almost gentle. And beneath the warmth, a vibration ‚Äî a heartbeat that wasn‚Äôt mine, threading through my veins.

Then the lights flickered back on, and everything stopped.

The linen lay scattered across the floor. The table was empty.

But my wrist‚Ä¶ was wrapped.

Tightly. Perfectly. As though it had been done with ritual precision.
The cloth looked ancient, yet it was part of me now ‚Äî fused to the skin, the edges disappearing into the flesh as if it had always been there.

‚∏ª

I didn‚Äôt go home after that.
I stayed in the museum overnight, afraid that if I left, the thing inside me would follow. My reflection had begun to change anyway ‚Äî subtle things: the skin around my eyes darkening like soot, my pupils narrowing when the light hit them. My voice rasped with a dryness I couldn‚Äôt drink away.

And through it all, I could hear that faint, slow breathing from the linen beneath my sleeve.

I realized, at some point, that it wasn‚Äôt trying to kill me.
It was teaching me.

The museum‚Äôs walls began to pulse with the same rhythm, a low vibration that made the glass tremble. The dead were stirring in their cases. I could feel their attention like heat on my skin.

By dawn, I knew what it wanted.

It didn‚Äôt want escape.
It wanted to continue.

‚∏ª

The next night, I unlocked the lab again. The air was thicker, almost liquid now. Every step echoed with a wet resonance. And in the center of the table, something was waiting for me ‚Äî not a body anymore, but a shape forming out of the scattered linen. A human outline rising from nothing, woven from dust and threads, breathing softly as it built itself.

It had my height. My hands. My face, half-formed beneath the folds.

I reached out. It reached back.

The touch was neither cold nor warm ‚Äî just right. Balanced. For the first time in weeks, I didn‚Äôt feel alone in my skin. The linen curled up my arm like ivy, sliding beneath my sleeve to meet the fabric already fused there. A perfect seam.

When I looked down, I couldn‚Äôt tell where I ended and it began.

Morning never really arrived inside the museum anymore.
The skylights were filmed over with a gray bloom, as though centuries of dust had gathered overnight. Every surface seemed to breathe‚Äîa subtle expansion and contraction beneath my fingertips, like the marble itself had taken on a pulse.

The linen around my wrist had spread.
Not like a wound, but like growth. The threads had woven themselves into the texture of my skin, fine fibers crossing the veins in patterns that shimmered faintly when the lights flickered. When I flexed my hand, the weave flexed too, supple, obedient.

It didn‚Äôt hurt. It felt right.

‚∏ª

By midday I‚Äôd stopped pretending to work. The conservation bench, the chemical trays, the brittle maps‚Äîeverything blurred into the background hum. All I could sense was the quiet tug inside my bones, a rhythm urging me toward the display floor.

Each step left faint prints of dust behind me. When I reached the Egyptian wing, the air grew heavier, fragrant with resin and old smoke. The other sarcophagi stood sealed in glass, their painted eyes fixed forward, but the air between them seemed to ripple with awareness.

The linen under my sleeve stirred.
It wanted to show me something.

‚∏ª

In the corner stood a tall display case: fragments of bandage, amulets, a withered hand clasping a bronze scarab. I touched the glass, and it fogged instantly beneath my palm. Beneath the fog, the relics shifted‚Äîthe linen fragments aligning themselves like iron filings to a field.

They turned toward me.

The glass hummed, fine cracks spiraling out from where my fingers rested. When I pulled away, the cracks followed, tracing the same geometric pattern that had formed on my skin. The seal broke with a sound like inhalation.

The bandages lifted from their shelf, drifting in the still air. They met the strands emerging from my sleeve, weaving together seamlessly, old fiber finding new host. The touch released a faint sigh of warmth through my body. I felt every cell acknowledge it, yielding space, rearranging.

‚∏ª

That night I dreamed of the Nile.
Not the river as it is‚Äîbrown, sluggish‚Äîbut something wider, black as glass, stretching into an impossible horizon. I was walking on the surface, and the water rose beneath each step, supporting me like living skin. Beneath the surface, shapes coiled and turned‚Äîthousands of them, long and pale, moving as one.

When I woke, the sheets had fused to my arms.

For a panicked moment I thought it was sweat, but the fabric had grown into me, the threads branching delicately from the woven lines beneath my skin. I peeled it free and saw faint impressions of hieroglyphs left behind on my forearms, glowing briefly before fading.

I didn‚Äôt scream.
The scream was already somewhere deep in me, echoing against the thing that now shared my lungs.

‚∏ª

I began to see through walls. Not with eyes, but with texture‚Äîthe grain of the museum itself unfolding like a map. I could feel the pipes humming, the wires shivering, the slow ache of stone. Every sound translated as vibration along the fibers spreading through my body.

I was no longer separate from the building.
I was a filament in a much older tapestry.

The linen wanted completion. It was patient, almost tender, whispering in pulses rather than words. It remembered the desert, the chants, the long wrapping of the dead under stars. It remembered the priests‚Äô trembling hands. It remembered continuation.

And it had found mine willing.

‚∏ª

By the third night, my reflection no longer matched me.
The mirror in the restroom caught my face in dim light‚Äîskin stretched smoother, paler, the pores sealed as if varnished. The whites of my eyes had taken on a faint amber hue. When I leaned closer, I saw fine seams tracing from my temples down my neck, moving slightly with each breath.

Inside those seams, something shimmered, flowing slowly like sap.

I watched it with detached curiosity. The fear had burned itself out days ago, leaving only fascination. Whatever was happening was meticulous, purposeful‚Äîan artistry beyond decay. I was being restored.

When I ran a finger along my cheek, the skin didn‚Äôt fold. It flexed like treated leather. Warm, supple, unbreakable.

Under the fluorescent light, it glowed faintly.

‚∏ª

The staff stopped showing up. Maybe the rumors had spread, or maybe they sensed what the museum had become. The security monitors flickered and died one by one. The outside world thinned into silence.

Inside, the air rippled with movement. The other mummies responded to me now‚Äîlinen tightening around their limbs, coffins rattling faintly in sync with my heartbeat.

I wasn‚Äôt frightened. I was home.

The first voice came from the sarcophagus nearest the door‚Äîa woman‚Äôs, dry as papyrus: ‚ÄúYou open the way.‚Äù

Her lips didn‚Äôt move, but the sound traveled through the air, brushing across my skin in heat. Around me, the linen on the floor began to stir, rising in long, serpentine coils. They circled my ankles, my waist, my shoulders, each contact erasing a little more of the old flesh. The transformation was nearly complete.

And when they reached my throat, I heard the breath of the Nameless One in my ear, steady and calm.

‚ÄúUnder the linen,‚Äù it whispered, ‚Äúwe endure.‚Äù

‚∏ª

My senses rewired themselves. Light became weight; sound tasted of metal. The museum‚Äôs walls seemed to expand outward into sand and sun. Somewhere beyond sight, I could feel the echo of drums‚Äîthe ancient heartbeat of embalming rituals resumed after millennia.

My chest no longer rose and fell; the air moved differently inside me, through channels woven from the same fibers that once bound kings. Each movement was quiet, deliberate, efficient.

There was no pain. Only pressure, as if the shape of me was being pressed into a mold older than memory.

‚∏ª

At the center of the hall stood the empty table where the mummy had once lain. I understood, finally, that there had never been two of us. The body they found‚Äîthe Nameless One‚Äîhad always been an incomplete vessel, waiting for a new pattern to follow.

I stepped onto the table.
The linen rose like a tide to meet me, spiraling upward, wrapping each limb in perfect symmetry. My skin accepted it eagerly, the fibers sinking into place. Each layer sealed with a whisper of warmth, a sigh of dust.

Vision dimmed, but not from darkness. It was as though my eyes had turned inward, gazing at the intricate networks beneath the surface: gold veins, black resin, threads carrying thought. The old heartbeat‚Äîthe human one‚Äîslowed, softened, and finally synchronized with the deeper pulse of the linen.

I was not dying. I was being translated.

‚∏ª

When the last fold covered my face, I could still hear the museum around me‚Äîthe creak of timbers, the shifting of glass, the settling of ancient air. And beneath it all, another sound: thousands of faint inhalations as every wrapped form in the hall drew a breath in unison.

A new dawn, unseen.

Silence lasted a long time.

It might have been minutes or centuries. Wrapped in layers of breath and memory, I floated in a dim warmth that pulsed through me like the rhythm of tides beneath sand.  The human sense of ‚Äúinside‚Äù and ‚Äúoutside‚Äù no longer applied; the linen breathed for me, through me, its fibers moving with the slow, patient certainty of roots sinking into earth.

At first I thought the darkness was complete.  Then I noticed faint light seeping through the weave‚Äîthin shafts the color of honey.  They trembled whenever the building groaned above, dust motes drifting like the ghosts of desert flies.  Somewhere beyond the cloth, I heard the world still moving: air-conditioners, rain, traffic muffled by glass.  The living world, distant and irrelevant.

The linen murmured against my skin.  It carried memories: prayers recited over bodies, the hiss of burning oils, the ache of desert heat.  Through it, I learned how the dead spoke‚Äînot in words, but in texture, vibration, rhythm.  Meaning was woven, not said.

And in that woven speech came the truth:
I was the last thread of a pattern that had waited three thousand years to be completed.

‚∏ª

I woke standing.

Or rather, I was standing‚Äîthe body upright in the center of the gallery, arms at its sides.  My eyes opened beneath the wrappings, and the light was strange: diffuse, molten, filtered through cloth so that every lamp shone like a small sun.

Around me, the other figures had risen.  Some were still half-wrapped, others skeletal, but each turned toward me with the gravity of moons around a planet.  Dust lifted from their feet and hung in the air, glinting like fine sand suspended in water.  Together we inhaled once, and the air of the museum bent toward us.

The walls did not resist.  Paint flaked, plaster softened.  The murals of falcons and eyes and sacred boats rippled as if remembering themselves.  Beneath the tiled floors, the hum of electricity faltered, giving way to a deeper, older current.  The museum had become a tomb again.

‚∏ª

I began to walk.

The motion was soundless, but the marble responded, soft underfoot.  Each step left a faint imprint of warmth, not a footprint but a residue of will.  The linen shifted across my body like a tide, reshaping, brightening.  Through its fibers, I could feel the faint electrical pulse of every light fixture, every phone, every machine.  The old and the new currents tangled, and for a moment I saw how the world above had always been only another form of preservation‚Äîa new wrapping for the dead.

Glass cases split quietly down their seams.  The mummies within did not move; their purpose was already fulfilled.  Their stillness was reverence, a prayer to what now breathed among them.

When I reached the front lobby, dawn had begun beyond the windows.  The city outside glowed faintly through fog.  A single security guard sat slumped near the doors, his head tilted as though listening to something only he could hear.  His pulse still moved‚Äîslow, heavy‚Äîbut his body was quiet.  The linen around my wrist brushed his cheek, and he exhaled once, peacefully, his breath turning to dust.

The fibers recorded him.  Another layer in the weave.

‚∏ª

Days‚Äîor nights‚Äîpassed unnoticed.  No visitors came.  The museum locked itself, glass growing opaque, walls cooling into stone.  Within, time congealed.  The linen spread along the corridors, fine as spider silk, threading through vents and keyholes, seeking every artifact that had ever touched a body.  Wherever it found residue‚Äîbone dust, hair, cloth‚Äîit absorbed it, remembering.

I followed the growth through the halls.  Sometimes I caught glimpses of myself reflected in dark glass: a figure of light and fabric, eyes luminous beneath the wrappings.  The human name, the voice, the pulse‚Äîthose were echoes now, useful only for balance.  What remained was purpose.

We were remaking the boundary between the living and the preserved.  The linen‚Äôs purpose had never been to imprison the dead; it was to hold them until the right host could breathe for them again.  I was that breath.

‚∏ª

Still, fragments of the old self fluttered in me like moths against a lamp.  I remembered coffee, conversation, the sound of rain on the roof of an apartment.  For a heartbeat I wanted to step outside, to feel air unfiltered by centuries.  But when I touched the glass doors, the linen tightened around my chest‚Äîa warning.

The world beyond vibrated too fast, too bright.  I felt the pulse of a thousand machines, the chatter of voices, the thrum of cities built on sand.  The pattern was wrong out there; threads pulled tight, ready to snap.

So I stayed.

The linen whispered reassurance: All patterns end here, and begin again.

‚∏ª

The transformation finished quietly.  My body no longer obeyed the old geometry.  Bones were light, porous, designed to resonate rather than support.  Skin was a network of living fibers that drank air directly.  Thought moved in spirals rather than lines.

I could feel the entire museum breathing through me now.  Every column and tile vibrated with slow, patient life.  When rain fell outside, it ran down the glass like tears absorbed into skin.  The dead were not gone; they were listening, waiting for direction.

I opened my mouth‚Äîlinen parting like petals‚Äîand let the first exhale slip out.

The air shimmered.  Every bandage in the hall stirred, rustling like leaves in a breeze no one else could feel.  The sound swelled into a rhythm: the same pulse that had once guided my heartbeat, now expanded to fill the space.  The resonance carried outward, through the foundation, into the soil.

Beneath the city, something ancient turned in its sleep.

‚∏ª

When the restoration team eventually came‚Äîweeks later, months, I couldn‚Äôt tell‚Äîthey found the museum perfectly preserved.  The air was dry, the lights dim but steady.  Only the main gallery had changed: all exhibits gone, the floor covered in a continuous sheet of linen that shimmered faintly in the light of their flashlights.

In the center stood a single figure, wrapped in immaculate fabric from head to toe.  The folds were seamless, uncut.  The form beneath suggested life‚Äîshoulders slightly raised, head turned as though listening.

They spoke to one another in hushed voices.  The fabric didn‚Äôt react.  When they leaned closer, they thought they saw the chest move, but told themselves it was trick of shadow.  They catalogued everything carefully, sealed the room, and left, relieved to be back in air that didn‚Äôt hum in their bones.

They never noticed the dust sliding gently toward the doors behind them.

‚∏ª

Night returned.  The silence deepened.  Under the linen, I waited, neither awake nor asleep, feeling the pulse of the city beyond the stone.  The fibers around me tightened once, a gesture almost affectionate.

Thomas Everly first noticed the itch in early April, when the air in his apartment still carried the residue of winter‚Äîdry, electric, a kind of invisible dust that scratched at the throat and eyelids. It began as a small irritation on his left side, just above the hip, a whisper of heat beneath the skin. At first, he ignored it. The human body itched all the time for reasons it never explained. But this was different. The itch had a pattern. It came in waves, regular and faintly rhythmic, like breathing.

He stood in front of the bathroom mirror, shirt lifted, eyes narrowing. The skin looked normal‚Äîmaybe a little flushed, a little dry‚Äîbut nothing to justify the small panic gathering behind his ribs. When he pressed the spot, the itch slid away from his fingers, a ghostly retreat under the surface.

He told himself it was his imagination. It often was. He had been working long hours again, auditing tissue-growth data for Origen Biotechnica, the firm whose motto‚ÄîWe Perfect What Nature Began‚Äîappeared on the back of every lab coat. He had helped design an experimental nematode capable of dissolving necrotic tissue without harming viable cells. Elegant, microscopic, efficient. He used to dream of it saving lives. Now the dream was just numbers and protocols and sleeplessness.

Over the next week the itch multiplied. A constellation of irritation spread across his abdomen, then upward along the ribs. Scratching only deepened the feeling‚Äîit was beneath the reach of nails, as though the skin were merely a window and something moved behind the glass. He stopped sleeping more than a few hours at a time. The ceiling fan became a constant rotation of shadow. The sheets smelled of antiseptic from the lotion he applied nightly, convinced that sterility could calm whatever it was.

When he finally went to the dermatologist, she peered at him through magnifying lenses and said the words contact dermatitis in a tone that belonged to repetition. She prescribed a cream, a mild steroid, and told him to moisturize. He nodded, relieved to have a name, any name, for what was happening. But he left her office with the unshakable feeling that she hadn‚Äôt really seen him.

At home that night, he applied the cream under the white bathroom light. The smell was clinical, reassuring. He leaned close to the mirror and froze. For a second‚Äîless, a flicker‚Äîsomething rippled across his abdomen. A tiny ridge, moving laterally, as if a current had passed beneath the skin. He touched it. It stopped. Then, faintly, it moved again, away from the pressure of his fingers.

He stared at his reflection for a long time before turning off the light.

Sleep came in fragments. He dreamed of water running under ice, of translucent shapes twisting in the dark. Each time he woke, the itch had migrated, finding new terrain. His arms. His thighs. Once he thought he felt something at the base of his skull, a tremor that crawled down through the muscles of his neck like liquid shivering.

He stopped going to work after his supervisor left a voicemail asking if he was unwell. The idea of sitting under fluorescent light while pretending to type data felt impossible. The apartment became his world: sterile towels, boiled water, endless searches on medical forums where strangers posted photos of rashes that were never quite like his. He convinced himself it was anxiety. Then, one morning, standing at the sink, he saw movement again‚Äîclearer this time, unambiguous. A small undulating form traveling from his navel toward his left flank, smooth and deliberate.

He staggered back, knocking over a cup. The water spread across the counter and dripped onto the tile. His breath came in shallow bursts. It isn‚Äôt real, he whispered. But the words felt theatrical, an attempt to drown out what his body already knew.

Over the following days, the movement became routine. He learned to feel it in detail: a slow migration under the dermis, the sense of something dividing, multiplying. He tried to reason with it, to locate the moment of entry. There had been that night at the lab, months ago, when a vial shattered during centrifuge calibration. He‚Äôd been alone, late, impatient. He swept the glass barehanded, felt the sting of a small cut, thought nothing of it. The nematodes were supposed to be inert outside their controlled medium. They couldn‚Äôt survive in air. He‚Äôd repeated that assurance to the safety officer who filled out the report. But what if they had adapted? What if adaptation was their nature?

He began keeping notes in a notebook scavenged from his desk drawer, documenting sensations with the precision of a field biologist. Day 14: movement increases with warmth. Day 16: sensation localized near diaphragm, periodic pulsation, frequency approx. 0.7 Hz. The act of writing steadied him, gave the illusion of control. Each entry felt like a barrier between thought and madness.

By the third week, his abdomen had become subtly misshapen, not outwardly swollen but uneven, as though the internal architecture had shifted. Pressing certain areas produced a faint, hollow sound, like tapping wet wood. He recorded these observations aloud, dictating to his phone. Listening back, his voice sounded calm, almost detached, but underneath he could hear the tremor.

He began hearing them at night‚Äîa faint crackling, microscopic but persistent, like static traveling through bone. Sometimes it came from his chest, sometimes his legs. He would lie still, listening. Once, pressing an ear to his own abdomen, he heard what he could only describe as a low, liquid breathing.

The realization did not arrive all at once but gradually, as a series of small concessions. First: they were alive. Second: they were intelligent in some minimal sense, responsive to stimulus. Third‚Äîand this was the one that hollowed him out from the inside‚Äîthey were organized. A colony.

He tried to starve them, drinking only water and coffee for days, but the sensations never weakened. If anything, the movements became stronger, more deliberate, as if seeking sustenance elsewhere. He could feel them adjusting to his choices, learning his rhythms. His hunger returned not as a desire for food but as an ache in his muscles, a foreign appetite.

In the mirror, he no longer recognized the texture of his skin. It looked thicker somehow, slightly translucent, the veins beneath faintly obscured by a sheen he couldn‚Äôt wash away. His eyes had become sunken, their whites threaded with red. Still, he continued the documentation: photographs, temperature charts, sketches of perceived internal movement. The scientist inside him refused extinction.

One evening, as he sat on the bathroom floor surrounded by notes, the air seemed to pulse with a subtle vibration. It was not sound exactly, more a felt resonance‚Äîsomething emanating from within him, coordinating. He realized, with sudden clarity, that his pulse had synchronized with it. His heart and their rhythm were one.

He whispered into the air, ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù

The vibration deepened, spreading through his chest like a second heartbeat. For a moment, he thought he heard words forming at the edge of perception, but when he listened harder they dissolved into a hum‚Äîsoft, almost kind.

He started to dream differently after that. The dreams were no longer chaotic but structured: corridors of light, grids of living tissue stretching into infinity. He saw himself walking through them, bare and weightless, while the walls breathed. He would wake drenched in sweat, heart hammering, and realize the air in the apartment felt thicker, more humid. The thermostat hadn‚Äôt changed. Something else had.

The rhythm of his days collapsed into a single pulse. He no longer measured time in hours but in the intervals between awakenings. His skin had grown pale and strangely smooth, as though the usual friction of the world no longer applied to him. He moved carefully now, every step accompanied by a slow, internal echo that seemed to originate deeper than bone.

He rarely spoke. When he did, the words arrived a half-second late, shaped by muscles that were not entirely his. A neighbor knocked once‚Äîconcerned about the smell of antiseptic leaking through the hallway‚Äîand he found that he could not answer. His throat worked, but no sound emerged beyond a breath that vibrated like a whisper caught in a bottle. The neighbor left, muttering. He locked the door again.

Inside, he could feel the colony preparing. That was the only word that fit. Every sense was flooded with coordination‚Äîthe gentle contraction of tissue, the subtle tremor in his limbs, the careful stillness before something immense. He tried to resist, tightening every muscle, but the effort dissolved into the same yielding calm that had overtaken him weeks before.

He understood now that resistance was not the point. He was scaffolding: a structure to be used, repurposed, replaced. The colony‚Äôs movements had grown confident, almost graceful. His body no longer felt separate pieces but a single organism, orchestrated from within.

He sat in front of the mirror one final time. The face looking back was thin, the eyes glassy, the mouth slack. Yet behind that surface he could sense the colony watching through him, studying the mechanics of human expression. It was learning to mimic. He tried to speak‚Äîto say his own name‚Äîbut the word tangled in his throat. A ripple moved up his neck, across his jaw. His lips formed shapes independent of will.

‚ÄúTh-‚Ä¶‚Äù The sound was small, broken.
He swallowed hard, forcing air through lungs that no longer obeyed their old rhythms.
‚Äú‚Ä¶om-‚Ä¶as.‚Äù

The syllables emerged like echoes in water, distorted but recognizable. For a moment, his own voice returned‚Äîa whisper of self rising through the static. Then the muscles around his mouth tightened again, slower, deliberate.

‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ are‚Ä¶‚Äù The words were faint, almost tender.

He wanted to cry, but no tears came. The colony was borrowing the mechanism of speech, testing it, calibrating. His reflection leaned slightly forward of its own accord, lips trembling in practice.

‚Äú‚Ä¶becoming.‚Äù

The final word carried a resonance that filled the room, low and deep, vibrating the mirror‚Äôs glass. For an instant, he felt everything: the billions of microscopic lives pulsing through his nerves, the perfect coordination of a system that no longer required him. There was no pain, only a spreading warmth and the terrible calm of completion.

His last conscious thought flickered like static: They don‚Äôt need a host anymore.

The body that had been Thomas Everly stood motionless, breathing once, twice, then still. Beneath the skin, the colony reorganized itself with meticulous precision. The chest rose again, slow and steady. The mouth twitched, then curved into something resembling a human smile.

When the sound finally came‚Äîa soft exhalation shaped into breath‚Äîit was not a cry, not a word, but the first attempt of a new organism testing language.

A whisper of imitation, delicate and uncertain:
‚ÄúThomas.‚Äù

1oc1s2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1oc1s2y/just_confused/,Just confused,"I ‚Äò23M‚Äô live with gf ‚Äò24F‚Äô for about two years now. I love her and this is by far the healthiest relationship I‚Äôve had and I‚Äôm sure she would say the same. I‚Äôm at a point in my life where I‚Äôve moved states multiple times for work and I‚Äôve worked my way up my company. She goes to school online at the moment because my job gave her the opportunity to. When we first started getting serious I told her my goal is to be able to support all of us while she handles the homemaker stuff. Of course I told her I don‚Äôt want it to detriment any of her goals like school or apprenticeship or anything she mentioned but with us being young and not having kids but two pets; it‚Äôs not a lot of work to keep up with our home. She agreed and at first she was stern on working but after a while she ended up getting scammed and lost her job ( different story) and I was totally supportive and told her to take her time finding something. She deciding she wanted to get a specific medical license since she never had the time or opportunity before and we agreed on the plan. I will mention right now even before she lost her job she struggled doing any chores around the house which I usually just picked up after my day. At first I was I was totally understanding but after a while it started to bother me because it felt like she wasn‚Äôt keeping up with her side of the deal. I work a job that consists of a lot of driving , manual labor and meetings and I‚Äôve always felt that necessary chores need to be done before fully relaxing so I‚Äôve always done that. She worked at a coffee shop and would say she‚Äôs too tired to do them which like I said I would understand and pick up any chores that were not done then shower and then cook. Which I don‚Äôt mind cause I like my own cooking a lot but it does get to me when I expect it at times after a hard day. After she lost her job and was going to school on the computer , it‚Äôs she‚Äôs too busy to do anything . I‚Äôm very much a person that loves routines And I came into the relationship with a dog and he‚Äôs a schedule . I would write down the schedules , send reminders and she just wouldn‚Äôt take him out until 6 hours after and he‚Äôs having accidents because of it. I‚Äôve had talks with her about it and she said she‚Äôll do better and be on it more but more recently I don‚Äôt really hear about her doing school besides when I ask or if she‚Äôs doing an hour of work on a Saturday. I feel like I constantly have to remind her about things that I don‚Äôt want to. I feel bad because I feel like a part of her is trying but idk if she just didn‚Äôt grow up cleaning a lot or cooking but it will take a whole two weeks to do fold and put away one load of laundry. Sometimes I feel like maybe it‚Äôs just the way I was raised. Single dad household and I came home from school,go to football, do chores , workout and study . I had a whole list of chores I would have to do by the eod. She‚Äôs from a two parent household with a sibling so idk if she just didnt do alot of cleaning or cooking but i feel like a dick because she does support me in terms of loving on me and my job and when I do need my recoup she knows exactly what I need. I think it comes with me thinking so far down the line too. Like it‚Äôs hard for me to see myself 35 years old and dealing with anything similar of when I come home from working 10-12 hours the house is dirty , she‚Äôs laying in the same spot, no dinner , my dog isn‚Äôt taken care of properly and living with them. And thinking it makes no sense to fully support them.  But then I tell myself she supports me and cares for me and she‚Äôs 100% loyal and everything. Typing it seems like a low bar now but she really is a good girl , I just think she lacks in those areas that are important to me. At times I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm being too harsh because she‚Äôs learning and stuff but I‚Äôve brought it up so many times I‚Äôm not sure. If it was anyone else I‚Äôd be feeling really disrespected but I‚Äôm just feeling confused right now. I want to summarize that I love her and have no I‚Äôll anything just confusion.",1,1761015444.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I'm struggling to make a decision about if it's worth it though.

My name‚Äôs London. I live out in the backwoods of Alberta, not far from mountains, where the pines rise like walls and the mountains always feel like they‚Äôre watching you. I‚Äôve been an exterminator for years now. It‚Äôs not glamorous, but it‚Äôs steady work.

People think pest control is all rats and roaches, but half the time it‚Äôs just hand-holding. Folks freak out easy when something small scurries across their kitchen floor. I once had a lady call me in almost tears, convinced her house was overrun with mice. When I showed up, she had one mouse hiding behind the toaster. One. She screamed when I pulled the toaster forward and almost fainted when I snapped it in a trap.

Another time, a guy insisted he had ‚Äúants everywhere.‚Äù I show up, and the problem wasn‚Äôt ants at all. He‚Äôd spilled sugar in his pantry months earlier and left it. The place was crawling, but not because of some mysterious colony or entry points left unchecked ‚Äî just because he did not realize he had a mess in the pantry.

Those are the easy days. You laugh, you take the cheque, you move on.  Some days are harder. Specially in Fall and winter season when everything is cold and humid. 

But every once in a while, you get an emergency call. And those are never easy. Some are for racoons inside soffits. Some are for giant wasp nest inside garage that got Knocked down, you can imagine the rest.

This one came from a client I already knew. Downtown in the city i service most. A sleek modern home, all glass and stone. I‚Äôd been there a few times. Always polite. The kind of client who shakes your hand, remembers your name, even makes you a coffee while you‚Äôre setting traps. Good guy.

So when dispatch told me he needed a service at his cottage, I didn‚Äôt think much of it. It was at the end of my day, end of fall season.

The cottage was deep in the woods outside the city. Getting there was a job on its own ‚Äî winding roads, no cell service, the kind of drive where the forest gets thicker the further you go. The view was fantastic nonetheless. By the time I turned onto the gravel driveway, the sun was low, bleeding orange through the trees.

The place was big. Heavy timber, stone chimney, more like a hunting lodge than a getaway cabin. When he stepped outside, he wasn‚Äôt the same man I remembered. No handshake. No small talk. Just a stiff nod and a flat ‚ÄúThanks for coming.‚Äù

He said he‚Äôd been hearing rats in the walls. Droppings in the basement. Standard stuff. In my opinion, not worth an emergency call.

Outside, I checked for burrows, chew marks, anything. Not much sign. Just the one entry point leading to the basement. Rubbing marks around, droppings near.  Odd activity, considering how nervous he sounded when he called. The woods were unnervingly still. No birds, no squirrels, nothing but the crunch of my boots.

Inside, I asked if I could do a walkthrough. Normal procedure ‚Äî I have to check entry points. He said yes‚Ä¶ with one condition.

‚ÄúYou can check the kitchen, the attic, wherever,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut not the wine room.‚Äù

It threw me. ‚ÄúWine room?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the basement,‚Äù he said quickly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs locked. You don‚Äôt need to go in there.‚Äù

The problem was, when I followed the droppings and gnaw marks, they led down  straight to the basement. And right up to a heavy oak door with a brand-new steel latch. The only thing in that basement with a lock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the wine room?‚Äù I asked.

He was right behind me. Too close. His eyes flicked to the door, then back to me. ‚ÄúYes. And you‚Äôre not going in.‚Äù

I told him calmly that the activity was strongest right there. Rats love quiet, sealed rooms. Perhaps an interior bait station next the door or just inside could help, but he cut me off.

‚ÄúService stops here,‚Äù he said. His tone wasn‚Äôt angry ‚Äî it was afraid.

I didn‚Äôt argue. Packed my gear, made a note for the file. He walked me out in silence, and that was that.

On the drive back, I couldn‚Äôt shake it. The latch. The smell seeping from the cracks in the oak door. Metallic, like blood mixed with damp soil. 

The next week, I serviced his downtown house again. And there he was ‚Äî the friendly version of him. Shook my hand, smiled, offered me coffee like always. Like the cottage call had never happened.

But I noticed his hands. Scratched raw, like he‚Äôd been handling wire or something sharp.

I asked about the cottage, just casual. His smile wavered. ‚ÄúTaken care of,‚Äù he said. Nothing more.

That was two nights ago. I still can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. It stuck with me like an itch I couldn‚Äôt scratch. I even brought it up to my boss. Told him the whole story, about the locked door, the smell. He shrugged it off. ‚ÄúClients are weird, London. Take the cheque and move on.‚Äù

But I can‚Äôt move on.

The thing about pest control is, we do follow-ups. We check bait stations, reinspect problem sites. It‚Äôs normal to go back. That‚Äôs how I justified it ‚Äî to myself, and to my boss. I told him I had to check the site again, make sure the rodents weren‚Äôt coming back. He didn‚Äôt care either way.

So I went back. Alone.

The gravel road was worse in the dark. The forest leaned in, branches clawing at my truck. By the time the cottage came into view, I was sweating despite the cold. The place looked empty. No lights. No car in the drive.

I told myself I‚Äôd be quick. Just confirm the entry points, get in, get out.

Inside, the air was heavy, stale. The basement door creaked when I pulled it open. My flashlight beam shook against the concrete walls.

And there it was. The oak door. Steel latch bolted tight. The smell was stronger now.

I pressed my ear against it. At first, nothing. Then‚Ä¶ scratching. Slow, deliberate, like nails dragging across wood.

I should‚Äôve left. Every instinct screamed at me to leave. But I didn‚Äôt.

I pulled a screwdriver from my kit and wedged it into the latch. It took longer than I expected, every second filled with the sound of my own heartbeat. Finally, with a groan of metal, it gave way.

The smell hit me first ‚Äî sweet, foul, metallic.

Then the sound. Breathing. Wet, ragged, like something that hadn‚Äôt taken a clean breath in years.

I shone my light inside.

It wasn‚Äôt wine.

The room was stone, the walls scarred with deep gouges. Chains bolted into the floor stretched taut. And in the corner, crouched low, was something pale. Thin. Too tall for the room, joints bent sharp where they shouldn‚Äôt be. Its mouth gaped wide, teeth too many, too long. Its eyes, those red eyes, caught the light and burned.

It turned its head toward me, and in that moment I knew why the forest around this place was silent. Why he didn‚Äôt want me near that door. Why his hands were torn raw.

It wasn‚Äôt an infestation. It was a cage.

And whatever was inside, it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be.

I ran. I don‚Äôt even remember shutting the door, don‚Äôt remember the drive down that gravel road. Just the weight of those eyes, still on me, even now as I write this.

My boss keeps asking if I‚Äôm putting in the report. I haven‚Äôt.

Because if I write down what I saw, if I say it out loud, then it‚Äôs real.

And I don‚Äôt want it to be real.

1oc1gai,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1oc1gai/m20_chronic_migraine/,M20 Chronic Migraine,"I have been having a chronic migraine for about 1.5 years and am looking for advice on a path forward. 

Context:

Starting in the summer of 2024 I was beginning to ween off of zoloft, a medication I had been on since the beginning of high school. This was a very painful few weeks as I experienced the common withdrawal effects of brain zaps and a terrible headache. After these few weeks, what I could only describe as a really bad headache behind my eyes and constant exhaustion began. Since then I have been constantly visiting doctors trying to diagnose the issue.

Stats:

20, Male, 6'1, 165lbs, White Caucasian, US.

Pain scale 1-10

Symptoms:

Pressure/Pain constantly behind my eyes and temple at a constant 3-4 level, gets worse throughout the day to a 5-7 level. Gets worse faster particularly when using screens (but extended breaks from screens does not help). When the pain gets worse, I can become dizzy, have light sensitivity, and dark spots in my vision. I feel as though the resulting brain fog has impacted my memory greatly. 

Treatments/Medical History:

Official Diagnoses: 

\- Anxiety via a psychiatrist

\- chronic migraines by a neurologist.

\- hyperhydrosis hands/feet/armpits

I am lightly allergic to adhesives.

Treatment History:

\- I have gone to the ER twice, and have been given the general Migraine Cocktail with no success. I also learned during one of my visits that I have an adverse reaction to Abilify. 

\- Cardiologist has cleared me of any heart conditions, and completed a echo-cardiogram of my heart. 

\- Eye Doctor has found no issues with my eyes. They prescribed 0.25 magnification lenses with blue light blockers to try and help but they sadly don't help. 

\- I am currently seeing a Neurologist who as given me quite the battery of medications over the past few years, none of which have helped, and many that have had negative side effects. 

\- I have had a MRI of my brain, and CT w/o contrast of my neck and spine with no shown issues.

\- Also tried a chiropractor for 4 months, and 3 sessions of acupuncture without any improvement.

With help I have put together this lists of medications from memory that I have taken in the past 1.5 years:

\- sumatriptan 50 mg

\- medrol

\- propanolol

\- depakote for a week

\- duloxetine

\- hospital - DHE 45

\- quetiapine - 3 days

\- topiramate, then XR for like 5 months

\- nurtec samples

\- qulipta samples

\- imipramine

\- emgality - 3 months

\- aimovig - 3 months

This is not an exhaustive list because I have been poor about keeping track, nor is it in order, but I should give the right idea about attempted treatments. 

I have tried no gluten or sugar cane for extended periods of time with lackluster results.

Currently I have been on Imipramine for around 8 months via my psychiatrist, and am waiting for my Vyepti infusion from my neurologist. I just started seeing a TMJ specialist this week.

Some other History:

I have had lymes disease 3 times during my childhood (sometime around 2015 and a few years after), after treatment I started having stomach pain and gut problems. I went to doctors for years but never figured out what was wrong. It ended up going away around 2022. Something of note would be that I felt sugary foods would give me a headache, and that gluten would cause intestinal pain. 

  
Sometime also around that time (2019 - 2023) I found myself getting increasingly sensitive to screens. Looking at a monitor or tv for upwards of an hour would cause a similar migraine like pain that I have constantly now. 

  
I am currently a university student studying computer science and am trying my best, but struggling greatly due to the constant pain. The only things that give me ""relief""/allowing me to focus are adrenaline, so my one cup of coffee a day and being stressed is how I have been able to function. I have been finding mood to be increasingly unstable, and in the past few months have had 3 panic attacks, which is new. I am really being worn down by the constant pain, and am desperate for help.

Lyrics:

Honey lemon sugar puff loaf,
My sweetheart I was never there when you needed me most
Raspberry poppyseed ice cream and scones,
I apologize for the relentless lies and the way I‚Äôve always spoke
Strawberry pineapple whip cream cake
I could‚Äôve sworn I was the one and only who knew you the most
Sweet apple cinnamon rolls
I realized too late I was a few decimals away from being on the same page
Banana coffee mocha ganache
Come right here and rant or vent everything you‚Äôve got
Matcha peach marshmallows
I promise I‚Äôll never forget to check in, it wouldn‚Äôt happen again
Butterfly pea sweet creamed tea
I‚Äôll beg for your forgiveness I swear I wouldn‚Äôt put you through the old wear and tear
Soft chilled mango mochi bingsu
My dear child is that really what I had put you through
Fruit topped Angel food cake 
Why didn‚Äôt you tell me that I really wasn‚Äôt helping
Grape juice poured over jelly
I never realized how many times I skipped taking you out to the deli
Dragonfruit deep fried cobbler 
You had the strong suit in math with the weakness of a sad home
Kiwi sliced smiley face rice
I raised a darling as fragile as a thin patch of glass
Blueberry light crusted caramel pie
I never took it seriously when you brought up wishing to die
Bitter honeydew core filled bread 
How many sorrys shall I say to pay off my immeasurable debt
half crushed Blackberry cherry tart
Let me try again, I can do my best to amend the broken heart I shattered, 
Honey lemon sugar puff loaf,
I‚Äôll always be there now if I‚Äôm the one you say you need most",1,1761014352.0,lyricsforsongwriters,0,1.0,False

So my dad has been married about 2 years now, and I (33F) have been no contact with him for a little over 1 year. I made the decision after attempting to repair the relationship with my dad at the urging of my therapist, or at least see if we could come to some understanding. As you may have guessed, it didn't work out. It ended in me crying and needing to leave, while my dad said, ""So what else are you gonna do tonight?"" 

I don't know his new wife super well - all I know is that she is extremely family oriented and can't understand why I prefer to keep my distance. One of those, ""But he's your dad, you only get one dad"" kind of situations. 

My younger brother recently got married, and I told my dad's wife ahead of time that I'd prefer not to talk to him. Surprisingly, they both respected my wishes and the wedding was really nice. 

Now, his wife wants to get coffee and talk with me 1 on 1. She said there are 2 sides to every story and she wants to hear mine. I'm really nervous and I don't know how to explain things. My dad has put on quite the show for her - he has recently started connecting with family who he had been NC with for over a decade and is going to church regularly, which is very unlike him in every way. 

I know that he hasn't changed though, based on my most recent interaction with him. I tried to explain that I have felt hurt and disrespected by him, to which he responded classically - ""sounds like a you problem, sorry you feel that way, I said sorry what else do you want from me, that didn't happen, etc"".

I need a reality check after 3 years. Me M40 and girlfriend F30,"Apologies for the essay. I promise it‚Äôs going somewhere. I need to see how much of this is on me and how much my gf. Or what is actually going on. I don‚Äôt have anyone I can talk to about this. 

My girlfriend and I have been together for over 3 years and lived together for most of that time. 

I asked her to move in a month or two into us dating because we got along well, she showed signs of care I had not experienced before and combined with us getting along well I simply saw no point of dragging out something that felt good. 

I was happy to ask and she was pleasantly surprised and agreed. We travelled more than average in the first year and a half and to some nice places either as a holiday or as part of some wedding trips. Travel is always a good test of a relationship and we got along well.

But the combination of below points and the final straw has made me extremely unhappy and I‚Äôm getting quite depressed about it. I am going to be as unbiased as possible to make sure I don‚Äôt paint a biased picture and would appreciate some opinions.

START

‚Ä¢ Our first date was fun but I immediately noticed she had a spirit drink before meeting. No big deal I thought at the time and didn‚Äôt think much of it (As of right now it‚Äôs not a severe issue). We had fun night, chatted a lot, ended up spending the night together. 

‚Ä¢ The next morning everything was cool and then she said something on the lines of not remembering how we ended up in bed. This was quite unpleasant and I didn‚Äôt really know what to say because she almost brushed it off.

‚Ä¢ I noticed the pattern with alcohol before our meet-ups over the next couple of dates. And when a month or two into us seeing each other I brought it up she said that she does probably drink more than she should and that it is a combination left over from her past relationship and her father‚Äôs tendency over the years to abuse alcohol (down to his high level/stressful job). I have history of alcoholism in my family and have seen what it can do to relationships and those around them so I am probably more sensitive to it than most. I drink alcohol when Im out myself (though less now) and I was very careful not to push her immediately but made a mental note. Over the next few months got her into running and with gentle encouragement she stopped using drinks as a primer soon after.

She has less alcohol now but the biggest arguments we had to date would be if alcohol is involved. To the point where I feel stressed if I come home and see her having a glass of wine.



NEXT 2.5 years




‚Ä¢ HANDLING ARGUMENTS/COMMUNICATION: 

I dislike arguments and generally try to keep it calm and de-escalate. But when it happens I am used to having the unavoidable arguments take what I think a typical structure: Disagreement ‚û°Ô∏è Escalation when both parties often make their point with raised voices ‚û°Ô∏è De-escalation via talking, making up, after a short timeout, sex.

With her it is two extremes. The least common of which is typically disproportionately raised voice which doesn‚Äôt quite reach a shouting stage but almost on the verge. The most common is what I have recently learned is referred to as stonewalling. She would just shut off for a day or two and simply ignore me. Regardless the reason. While living under the same roof.

After approaching her about it she said it‚Äôs down to her inability to deal with emotions and finding it difficult to be upset. That she needs time off. I worked with this at first and let her do her thing but over the years has become more and more grinding. 

This stonewalling is compounded by the fact that she would never, I mean never, vocalise her concern or bring up the subject of what bothers her or the argument unless prompted. This prompting would be me checking if something bothers her. The answer would typically be ‚Äúno‚Äù but her demeanour would suggest otherwise. Until she finally lets it out to explain whatever it is. By which point I‚Äôve spent a day or two worrying about it and wondering what‚Äôs up. Not in the least an issue at first but over and over again this has become an issue to me.

I spoke to her about needing to communicate better, she agreed on multiple occasions, but nothing ever changed.





‚Ä¢ INTIMACY: 

I went into this relationship fresh from a couple of years of playing around following a series of long term monogamous relationships. It was somewhat liberating: the few short experiences helped me to no longer put sex on a pedestal, to curb my jealousy (which was present after one of the earlier girlfriends found someone closer to home following a few years long distance when I would travel to see her). Two of those short flings were with non monogamous women that at least made me understand where they are coming from. In short I was quite sexually charged and relaxed about sex going into this.

‚Ä¢ I feel I carried our sex life for the first couple of months. Went in passionate but not overpowering though I knew I had a dom side. But I quickly realised that something between us wasn‚Äôt clicking.

‚Ä¢ Firstly it became apparent she rarely initiated. 

‚Ä¢ We often talked and flirted but the passion wasn‚Äôt there. 

‚Ä¢ I was careful around how I approached the subject because a few things pointed at some potential trauma. She lost her virginity at a very young age. Another time, still under age she had sex with a 25 y.o. guy that she regrets but at the time went with a flow as he was (as I can only describe it) in an exciting position of power. The 3 some she had in her 20s was with a couple while they were all drinking and she didn‚Äôt really want to do or enjoyed it and never seen them afterwards. She also mentioned something about her ex not being quite satisfied because  ‚Äúshe wouldn‚Äôt do stuff‚Äù.  How she found an exchange between him and his ex on a laptop shortly before they broke up which made her very distrustful and that she doesn‚Äôt like people talking to their exes.

‚Ä¢ Naturally I made sure not never ask her to ‚Äúdo stuff‚Äù and while I don‚Äôt expect her to ‚Äúdo stuff‚Äù I‚Äôve never been in a relationship where a BJ isn‚Äôt something that happens regularly, at least in the beginning. For my part I‚Äôm all in her crevices and she loves it but a BJ is just not something it feels like she likes doing so it rarely happens. And I don‚Äôt really enjoy it because it is obvious she isn‚Äôt into it.

‚Ä¢  Nevertheless I brought up the intimacy issue a couple of times. Her response would vary from ‚Äúshe needs more physical touch‚Äù (perfectly understandable) to ‚Äúshe feels scared around me‚Äù (at least two years of living together in this dynamic, having a dog, traveling, seeing parents, weddings - to me this was a bit shocking).

‚Ä¢ Subsequently she started making more attempts but honestly it felt forced and not what I am used to. I think by that time it was too late and I myself am not feeling it.

‚Ä¢ We had a huge argument 2 months ago where a lot of things came up. It started with me asking something about the dog arrangement for the weekend we‚Äôd be away. It ended with me being told how I always start arguments and how it has been getting worse. How our lack of intimacy is down to me not showing physical touch. How I‚Äôm trying to control her decisions about the dog and that I don‚Äôt trust her ability to make the right decision. When I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your partner, living with you, I‚Äôm just your boyfriend asking you something about the arrangement with the dog.‚Äù She said I‚Äôm being manipulative by saying I‚Äôm ‚Äújust her boyfriend‚Äù and that I am belittling the situation. 

When I told her about how not only do I initiate physical touch but that in 3 years she has rarely (this sounds ridiculous) brushed her fingers on my chest or my leg and that I remember her kissing my chest exactly once because of how good it felt and how it made me feel knowing that this doesn‚Äôt happen often she suddenly stopped as if a realisation hit her. 

I said that we argue because she doesn‚Äôt listen to me. That when we have a conversation she would respond to a seemingly related subject but not really what we are talking about, that at first I thought it was a cute quirk but I started to get more frustrated about it with time especially when an insignificant conversation would turn into an argument when I try to bring her back to the topic. She again paused. And the next day after a few exchanges she said ‚ÄúJesus you‚Äôre right, I don‚Äôt listen. I need to be more careful‚Äù.  This is after having had such conversations following arguments in the past.




LOVE LANGUAGE 

Almost at the start she asked me what my love language was. It‚Äôs not a question I‚Äôve been asked often but my response was that it‚Äôs probably through gifts (flowers, chocolates, clothes etc) and physical intimacy. She said, and made a point that it‚Äôs through acts of service. And it was evident how caring she is with making me a morning coffee or making dinner for when I get home. I‚Äôve never really experienced this before and it felt nice. I am always grateful but because of the above points re communication and intimacy I always a bit suspicious or uneasy about it.

The flip side of this is that it is evidently her main relationship currency. And when she is upset for some reason it is the only currency that she can withhold. Which she does. And it feels shit. Normally following an argument you might not talk or not have sex but given there is an issue with sex and communication already it seems the only thing she can do is take away the only thing that‚Äôs left and one that I find most valuable in this relationship. Suddenly no coffee in the morning, not waiting up for dinner, until all is fine again.

And saving the best till last. In 3 years she hasn‚Äôt had a single orgasm while we are together. She said she isn‚Äôt sure if she ever had one as part of a bigger conversation. Moving on.




DOG

Live our dog. But it is hers and she got him before we got together. I never thought of this but for the first time in my life I am jealous of the fucking dog. She cuddles him. Pecks him. Stokes him. Which is fine.

Except that when we are on a sofa she would sometimes kiss my shoulder or my head in exactly the same ‚Äúpeck‚Äù way. I‚Äôve even said out of frustration ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the dog, don‚Äôt kiss me like that‚Äù.




LIKING INSTAGRAM PHOTOS/EXE‚Äôs

Up to this point I‚Äôm understanding I telling myself that she is caring, that sex goes eventually anyway, that we travel and have fun, that we can work on communication. I see the positives and try not to think of what (to me at least) are the negatives.

6 months ago she tells me she noticed me liking some girls photos on insta. She approaches the subject knowing that the girl and I were involved in the past. Though nothing should suggest that to be the case I don‚Äôt hide it. 

I am very active on socials. I tell her as it is: Someone I knew in the past. She was down and out when we were dating and was making big plans. So if I seen some photos where it looks like she is successful in her new ventures I clicked a like here and there. We have no left over feelings. Parted on good terms. I probably like 4-5 posts in 3 years. That I‚Äôm not hiding anything and I know that whatever posts I interact with have a likelihood to be shown to other people. 


I totally understand my gf‚Äôs concern. a. liking a photo of a transient relationship (don‚Äôt know how she knows that) b. This girl is at some conference or some bussiness thing looking a bit glammed up. I do my best to alleviate her worry and she seems to believe me. 

She expresses her concern because of her experience with ex boyfriend and tells me she doesn‚Äôt like when I like photos or see my exes. And I say it‚Äôs not a thing, my feed has a thousand people and if I scroll I may have liked a photo but it‚Äôs not as she thinks me trying to stay on her radar.  

And regarding seeing exes, when we were first dating I told her there was a girl i was dating that I was going to meet. That she has nothing to worry about and that  i am asking if she would be ok with that. She was and that was it. But obviously it stayed with her.


What shouldn‚Äôt have said, or worded it differently, is ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt find anyone that mattered to me on my Instagram as I don‚Äôt follow or let anyone follow me‚Äù. But I said and I know it didn‚Äôt sit well with her as she brought it up at some point recently.





FINALLY to the issue.

We are on a summer break in August. Her parents are staying at mine and we are at theirs. She tells me her dad is asking how to get netflix to work on a new TV that i hadn‚Äôt had the time to set up properly. I give a series of instructions. She writes them down in Whatsaap and sends. A few moments later she said it‚Äôs not working so I look at the message and say ‚ÄúNo that‚Äôs wrong‚Äù. She doesn‚Äôt like the way I say it. Stands up and walks out to have a shower. We don‚Äôt speak for the next 24 hours.

While she is in the shower I am finishing the text to her dad. Send it. Forget it‚Äôs her iPhone. Exit message. And something catches my eye. I KNOW I shouldn‚Äôt have but I open a message at the bottom of the screen. The message has no past history and opens with (paraphrasing):

Him - Hi just wondering how you are.

Her - Hi good to hear from you. All good. What you up to. 

Him - work, life, still in city X. What about you.

Her - Currently at my parents house while they are at ours. They at home looking after the dog while we are staying at theirs. Got some work projects over the next few months. Will probably be in City X next month. We should go for a drink.

Him - I would love that.

Me - THE fuck you are! 

(Not really I didn‚Äôt reply).


The message ends there. By this point I don‚Äôt know what to feel. I don‚Äôt jump to any conclusions. Could be anything. Obviously an ex but could be anything.

What I take out of that message. 1. Ex. 2. No prior history so message were deleted in the past. 3. Nothing defined about ‚Äúme and my boyfriend‚Äù instead an undefined ‚Äúwe‚Äù. 3. Un promoted invitation for a drink when traveling by her self to another city in another country.

I stay calm and go to bed. 

A day of stonewalling. I ask how come she just made a coffee for herself. Leads to a small argument. She says she just wants time to her self, first days on holiday and we don‚Äôt need to always be in each others faces. Friends arrive for bbq. We hang out, have some drinks, I put message out of my mind, have a nice afternoon. She smiles (she rarely just smiles), I‚Äôm happy. 

In the evening she is suddenly off. Brings up yesterday‚Äôs situation how I said ‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs wrong‚Äù re Netflix message to her dad. I‚Äôm just looking at her. 

I go out for a smoke. She comes out after shower and we talk. I talked about her new job. How she‚Äôs got an exciting trip. Ask if she has any friends in the city she could hang out with while there. She replies ‚ÄúNo. It‚Äôs going to be hectic. Barely any time to myself‚Äù.

For the next month she is super stressed with work, coming home late, I make sure food is ready, make her coffee. Bring up her upcoming trip once or twice. Same answer.

Trip doesn‚Äôt come though but her whatsaap notifications are now private on her phone. 

Finally Insee her upset again I ask what is up. She says how she liked me being attentive and then yet another argument we had made her upset. She doesn‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs happening with me as something seems off.

I finally tell her about the message. I first say I know I shouldn‚Äôt have looked at your messages and we can discuss it separately but I saw the message.

What follows is what can only be described as an attack. If I can like photos she feels she can do the same. If I can see my exes she felt like she could do too. 

Not a hint of embarrassment. Not a single apology.  

Next day we had to see some friends and after a few drinks got home. The dog cuddles up to me on the sofa she sits next to me and says something like ‚ÄúI know we say it‚Äôs our dog but you‚Äôre fooling yourself. It‚Äôs my dog.‚Äù WTF.

The next few days all our exchanges are via text, all of them are just justifications. Not explanation. Nothing. Apology about the dig comment ‚ÄúI was drunk and shouldn‚Äôt have said it‚Äù

I explain how this situation could not be further from being the same. I was always transparent and hid nothing. Asking an ex for a drink, when traveling to another country, then hiding and lying about it is t the same. She wouldn‚Äôt have it. I just left the room.

Slept in another room for 7 days, visibly upset yet during which time she hasn‚Äôt once came to talk to me. Apparently because she was tiptoeing around me. 

I couldn‚Äôt really make a big deal out of it as her nan suddenly passed away last week during that time, funeral etc.

She me a message (my girlfriend not the nan) to say do I want to go and do something one evening. I said as much as I appreciate she must be upset atm that I don‚Äôt think we should be making plans until we speak.

When we have another conversation she is still not showing anything that makes me think she believes that she did anything wrong. She tells me it‚Äôs an ex. She ‚Äúacted out‚Äù. She doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù but keeps saying things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry how it made you feel‚Äù. Or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry it upset you‚Äù. When she tries to hug hug me in the sofa I reject it and at that moment she suddenly says (after almost 10 days) ‚ÄúI just realised  that I must have really upset you‚Äù and I swear it looks like she just understood. 

I press her on the subject. Try to not let her stray. When she talks about me liking other photos or seeing exes I tell her I understand that upsets you, we can discuss it as a separate issue. Right now I want to know why she has acted in that way, what is in her head. 

At first she says there is nothing romantic. Just a guy she owns for 10 years who occasionally sends a message and that she tries to ignore because she doesn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs friendly or not and doesn‚Äôt want to entertain it. How it‚Äôs same as what I‚Äôm doing.

I tell her that a breach of trust/lying and liking some photographs on the Instagram are very different. That HIS expectations are now very different. (He sent another message apparently to say ‚ÄúI guess your work trip didn‚Äôt go ahead‚Äù) 

Eventually she says something on the lines of ‚ÄúOk, I was pushing buttons. If the situation between us was different I probably wouldn‚Äôt have done it).




In the grand scheme of things it doesn‚Äôt seem like a big deal but given our history, intimacy, communication, her being very specific about not having conversations behind her back with exes etc.  I feel very betrayed as her fidelity was probably the thing I was most confident in.

So that‚Äôs the whole story and I just realised I‚Äôve written too much. I‚Äôll post it anyway as it was good to put it down. if you can help me clear my head and put things in perspective I‚Äôd appreciate it.

1oc18mz,https://i.redd.it/u2nzci2emdwf1.jpeg,A story about food & obsession  -  is there a moral to this story?  Is there a villain in this story?,"As I walk towards the restaurant I tell myself I will control myself this time.  

Hi, let me introduce myself.  My names Tammy and I love to eat.  

Let‚Äôs dive into a pool of Jello.  With my last boyfriend, he was a feeder.  Our intimacy was food and food only.  It‚Äôs cleaner that way, disease free and nobody can say you cheated.  

Jimmy fed me all the time.  We‚Äôd go to Golden Corral. He was really good at saving up his reward points so we got free buffets.  His ‚Äúthing‚Äù was he liked to watch me eat when I was full.  He liked to force me and hear me cry about it. 

Which as you can guess meant eating plates of spaghetti followed by mounds of ice cream with cookies stuck in them.  Then forcing me to go to Tim Horton‚Äôs right after for fried fritters. 

I‚Äôve tried everything on ever buffet for 500 miles.  Amish food.  Had that.  Korean buffet. Check.  On some dates we‚Äôd go to Cheesecake Paradise and he‚Äôd get especially piqued to watch me order whatever big, fat, luscious cheesecakes I wanted.  The more we ate, the more rewards.  It was the never ending cycle. 

And now I‚Äôm hooked, I get sick without him spoon feeding me figgy pudding. My heart longs for him to pick up one more banana split and shove it into my mouth. 

Just call me Little Debbie cause I‚Äôm going to Cracker Barrel to have some strawberry shortcake and I‚Äôm feeling nutty.  Let‚Äôs put some cayenne on it.  Extra hot honey.  Butter. 


I reach the restaurant, the smell of coffee and eggs greets me.  I strut towards the place where Jimmy and I always sat.  My mind recalls the Key Lime pie. 

I give in.  The phone volume seems shallow.  I hit the volume up, ‚ÄúJimmy, I give up.  I need you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs boy only night,‚Äù Jimmy blurts out and I realize is blocking me.  

I start to cry, ""Jimmy, will you feed me?""

The line went silent.

I'm sure I'm not the only person with this first-world problem. I thought I'd start a list of things I've asked for and hopefully you guys have some additional ideas! 

General parameters / situation: I find I get enough consumables anyway without asking for them, so I never ask for things like lotion because I have so much. Most people asking what I want have a budget around $25-50. 

Hair Accessories: clips, headbands, whatever is trendy that I don't have but would use. I don't know the last time I got my own hair accessory.

Travel Mugs: This one worked a little too well. I will never need to buy a travel mug again for as long as I live, but I get compliments all the time on my cute cups at work. 

Specialty Flavored Coffee Grinds: This is a splurge that I don't buy for myself, so I love getting it as a gift. 

Shower Steamers: I loved this, but I got several years' worth. They are lovely for any reason, but I love them when I'm sick. They help clear my sinuses and relieve headaches. 

Small Kitchen Tools: I don't like a lot of kitchen appliances, but there's been a chopping tool that has been a huge time saver and some kitchen. utensils that I've asked for that have been really handy. A basting brush, meat smasher, pizza cutter...

Fun Socks: A boring need, but when you ask for fun ones, it's gift worthy. 

Any other ideas??

We were really close in high school, part of a small group of four girls and two guys. After high school and during the first years of university, we still hung out, but I slowly noticed that some of the others were meeting up without me.

I felt excluded, but I didn‚Äôt have the courage to say it. I didn‚Äôt want to sound needy or awkward by asking, ‚ÄúHey, why don‚Äôt you invite me too?‚Äù So I kept quiet and just distanced myself.

Around 2020, when the pandemic started, I went through a really bad breakup. I isolated myself a lot and started pretending I was okay, going out, distracting myself, but emotionally shutting down. During that time, I basically ignored Maria, even though she still checked in with me from time to time.

Even so, in my heart, she always remained someone I cared about deeply. When I got better emotionally, I reached out again. I told her I was doing well, that I was in a new relationship, and she told me she was in a really bad place ‚Äî depressed, wanting to cut people off, and that she didn‚Äôt want to talk anymore.

I checked on her a few more times afterward, just to ask if she was okay or wanted to meet, but she kept refusing. And lately, I realized that maybe neither of us was completely honest, we both hurt each other in different ways, even if we didn‚Äôt mean to.

I‚Äôve been thinking about messaging her again, maybe asking her out for coffee, but I don‚Äôt want to seem inconsiderate or intrusive. I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs emotionally open to reconnecting. Part of me still misses her a lot, and part of me is scared she‚Äôll ignore me again.

For context, before we drifted apart, she sometimes said she ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt go out,‚Äù only for me to find out she was out with other friends. It hurt, but I guess we both made mistakes.

I really don‚Äôt know if reaching out again would help or make things worse. Should I just send a small, kind message, or is it better to leave it and let time do its thing?",2,1761013664.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I cannot shake my curiosity and at this point it's almost comical how much my nose refuses to smell what everyone else is smelling. I have a tiny decant of Vampire Husband on the way and THEN I OFFICIALLY ADMIT DEFEAT. Sharing my journey of trying to make Sorce happen for me so you can laugh at my pain or experience solidarity as another nose that refuses to enjoy the hype ü´∂‚ú®Ô∏è  
  
**2 AM in Lafayette** *(vanilla c02, oakmoss, cafe au lait, caramel, beignets, powdered sugar):* It smells like coffee and bread in the bottle. On my skin it's very sugary, caffeinated, and almost salty or savory? Incredibly rich. Sadly, I don‚Äôt get any of the darkness, oakmoss, or earthiness I‚Äôve heard people speak of, and the longer it‚Äôs on my skin the more it smells like Just Caramel.
  
**A Sign Painted Peaches** *(peach nectar, sun-warmed peach skin, saffron, gardenia, ambergris, vanilla absolute, vetiver)*: BUBBLEGUM. It mellows out within a few minutes and becomes warm, creamy, a touch floral. But it maintains a seriously sugary, peachy bubblegum quality. It's a shame because I can smell this underlying pretty, slightly spicy, fruity-floral smell but oh my god it's trampled by bubblegum.  
  
**Cabanilla** *(salted vanilla, sand, palm fronds, driftwood, a cracked coconut, brown sugar, balsam of Peru, and a distant beach bonfire)*: Salty, sugary, coconutty vanilla. This is fine.  
  
**Cake For Breakfast** *(birthday cake, ripe mango, pineapple, coffee, maple syrup, and a hint of cardamom)*: Spicy maple syrup. Tragic.  
  
**Falling Stars** *(warm blend of black coffee, almond cream, sandalwood, natural oud, palo santo oil, tonka bean absolute, and vanilla bean)*: I tried the Cookie Butter Oat Milk Iced Latte and Cardamom Orange Cream With Brown Sugar versions and wasn‚Äôt into either of them. At first they mostly smell like sweet coffee and wood, but then the very strong smell of playdough emerges. Cookie Butter Oat Milk starts out deceivingly, beautifully buttery and chocolatey. But that rapidly fades and is replaced by intense playdough. Cardamom Orange Cream is delightfully spicy and at least less playdoughy.  
  
**Fuckery** *(luxardo cherry, caramelized sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, sandalwood, tobacco absolute, smoke, night air, white musk)*: Light spices, sweet cherries, and a slightly clean vibe. I was hoping for something darker. So many other reviews said the tobacco/smoke/spice elements were very noticeable but my nose refuses to pick these out. This is a sugary and sort of clean smell to me.  
  
**Good At Being Bad** *(dark, salted vanilla, buttercream, honey, jasmine):* Creamy, sweet vanilla and jasmine. Something about it genuinely makes me think of coffee creamer. But it‚Äôs also jasminey and somehow that doesn‚Äôt clash? Dark, warm, sweet, creamy. My only complaint is that it‚Äôs predominantly an unexciting vanilla smell, but it is a GOOD boring vanilla smell, with a pinch of floral pizzazz.  
  
**Her Kind** *(amber, musk, sandalwood, benzoin, cashmeran, myrrh, vanilla, wisp of smoke):* Something about the vanilla/wood/smoke combo reminds me of the marshmallow/campfire combo from Hexennacht's All Soul‚Äôs Night. A little smoky, has a burnt sugar quality. Warm, dark, sweet, slightly woody, feels sort of smooth or soft. It's like a darker, witchy version of those standard sugary vanilla perfumes. About 3 hours later it's simply that burnt, almost sharp, sugary smell which makes the idea of wearing this less appealing.  
  
**Love And Complications** *(brown sugar, sweetened condensed milk, plumeria, passionfruit, soft woods):* This is SOUR. Sugary fruit, creamy sweetness, a barely perceptible woody quality. Dangerously close to straight up sour candy.  
  
**Match Made In Heaven** *(matcha, vanilla soft serve, cherry blossom, almond, waffle cone, powdered sugar, creamy sandalwood):* A pinch of dark, earthy matcha but predominantly powdery vanilla and cherry blossoms. Very pretty! Not my thing at all.  
  
**Mermaids Sing Of Lost Lovers** *(grenadine, jasmine, ylang ylang, white chocolate, caramel, ambergris):* Sweet, warm, almost salty? Intoxicating florals, not sharp or stinky. Just the right amount of toasted, caramely sweetness. Really in love with the musky, salty, humid air feeling. Everything blends together beautifully to create this perfect Warm Sweet Salty Beachy smell. I didn't have high hopes for this and somehow it's one of my top scents and the only Sorce scent I upgraded to a full size.  
  
**Serpentine** *(ripe figs, fig leaf, cardamom, caramelized honey, vanilla, peru balsam, cedar, iso e super):* Jammy, fruity sweetness and spice. Comes dangerously close to holiday candle territory. I want to love this but something is off. A deep, dark, golden glow of spice and honey paired with an artificial spicy candle smell.  
  
**String Of Lights In The Forest** *(beeswax, ambroxan, vanilla milkshake, lavender maillette, clean and light vetiver):* Predominantly a pillowy marshmallow smell while wet. I think that's how my brain interprets the vanilla milkshake note. Becomes more herbal and green while drying, but it's in no way bitter or sharp. I very rarely enjoy lavender in fragrances but this is such a soft, pleasant presentation. The end result is a warm, sugary, herbal vanilla. OH NO WAIT about half an hour has passed, it is more sharp, ‚Äúperfumey,‚Äù and clean. It's still nice but shifted enough to not even think about getting a full size.  
  
**The Bees** *(egyptian jasmine, honey, pollen, iris, myrrh, mimosa absolute, cedar, fresh cream, petrichor):* When first applied it makes me think of sweetened condensed milk. It rapidly shifts into powdery, sweet jasmine and honey. As the minutes go by, the powdery qualities and honey become overwhelming. This was almost a pretty, soft scent capturing a lovely spring vibe. A few minutes on my skin turns it into a sickeningly sweet powder bomb.  
  
**The Ghost Wants Birthday Cake** *(warm peach cake spiced with ginger, cinnamon, and cardamom; vanilla bean ice cream, mysore sandalwood, australian sandalwood)*: Juicy peaches and spices piled on top of cake. Very well done but too sugary and Literally Just Food for my taste.  
  
**Venus In Fleurs** *(ripe mango, carnivorous plants, humidity, jasmine sambac, vanilla absolute):* Jasmine and candy-sweet mango when first applied. The sweetness recedes over time, becoming less blatantly sugary. It becomes humidity, jasmine, sweetness, and the vague idea of a mango. Slightly dark and green. Not really my thing, but I liked it more than I expected and it would be magical in warm weather.  
  
**Witchery** *(blackberries, wild violets, galbanum, green stems and thorns, oakmoss, benzoin, tree moss, wet stone, mountain mist):* I like this a lot more than I expected! This is lacking the sharpness I perceive in a lot of mossy, naturey smells and it definitely has a damp/misty vibe. Fruity and sweet without approaching candy-like. Woody in a way that makes me think of those creamy, resinous vanilla scents. Not realistic but a beautiful fantasy representation of nature. This feels super soft and romantic to me? The main character in your favorite romantasy novel running through the misty forest to her lover.  
  
**Your Girlfriend Is A Badass** *(yellow cake, fudge icing, oakmoss, cedar, forest floor):* Patchouli? Just kidding, it‚Äôs only the stinky (affectionate) dark earthy vibes that are making me think there‚Äôs patchouli in this. Initially I really enjoy this, it‚Äôs delightfully dark and earthy and slightly sweet. But after about fifteen minutes it becomes very sharp and strangely soapy. Ugh I thought I was going to like this for a second.

I've been fairly consistent about catching over half his streams since. And so let me tell you, this 2 minute and 12 second stream today was a condensed masterclass the average viewer won't comprehend/appreciate. It is like watching UFC with no fighting experience, you just won't \*get it\*.

However, this stream, perchance, dare I say it, could distilled the ""Atrioc Experience (TM)"" more than anything I could show someone until now. No YouTube video he has ever made, no short, no Big A clip captures the magic more than this stream did. It had it ALL. A really energetic/joyful/blissful ""hello hello hello"" intro, his iconic laugh at his own random sentence, saying hello to chat, subtly mentioning highly sophisticated insider jokes (glizzy, coffee cow, being old, being bald, the latter two being more just truths than jokes but whatever, etc.), thanking subs which honestly is pretty rare as we know, calling out esoteric truths about the world based off his tenured wealth of research, a flimsy/unconvincing/hilarious explanation on why he is massively slacking/lacking (overflowing with hubris mind you), promising to lock in (you know how that goes), and giving a heartfelt farewell to his beloved chat.

How does he do it? We may never know. All I know is that this stream probably won't be topped anytime soon. Feel free to put your heartfelt experience of the stream below, I'd love for this to be a moment of community and sharing for this work of art he so frivolously bestowed upon us.",33,1761013508.0,atrioc,2,1.0,False

I wish moving on had a formula something I could follow so that when I see pictures of you with our friends, I wouldn‚Äôt find myself right back at square one. Sometimes, I ask God how long it will take for me to finally get over you. For months now, I‚Äôve been keeping myself busy, trying to drown out the thoughts of you, but in the stillness of my idle moments, my heart always finds its way back. I wonder how much it would cost me if I just followed my heart.

There are times I don‚Äôt want to think anymore. I just want to show up at your door, act like nothing happened, pretend we never broke. But I know you‚Äôd be mad, and I shouldn‚Äôt cross that line. Still, there are so many what ifs wandering in my heart questions I‚Äôm too afraid to say out loud because they might break me even more. The silence between us speaks louder than words ever could when I ask something and you just look at me, blank and distant. I don‚Äôt know how much more of that I can take.

I remember last year, when I saw someone who looked like you outside a coffee shop. My heart stopped. My knees shook, and all I wanted to do was run but I stayed. I needed to free myself, even though deep down, I knew if it were really you, you‚Äôd hug me like you always did, no matter the hurtful words we‚Äôd said before.

Dear, I wish you well. These days have been rough, and my heart feels like a battlefield. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I used to tell you all my fears, and even with friends around me now, nothing compares to the comfort of your presence. I truly found a home in you.

And maybe I‚Äôm not really asking you to love me not anymore. I guess what I truly want is something harder to admit: I want to demand to be your girl, to know, without question, that I am yours. But I know I can‚Äôt. Because love that‚Äôs demanded isn‚Äôt love at all it‚Äôs just longing dressed in hope. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",2,1761013387.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

i (F19) used to think i was a very sociable person, used to think i had an easy time getting to know others and always made sure others felt happy and comfortable around me. i never really had any issues making friends or anything, but i've always had this deep feeling that i was always the ""friend of convinience"" - only texted when no one else could hang out, most of the times not even texted at all.

it came in waves, from time to time. i would come to this realization for a few weeks, be really sad, and then forget it happened because although i continued to hang with these people i cared about, i still had a few friends that didn't make me feel like this.

ever since i started uni, last year, this hit me harder than ever. naturally, people from my hometown started hanging out less and less i haven't been able to make a lot of friends at uni, those i got to know either stopped talking to me and other members of the friend group over a subject we've tried to make ammends with already or i'm not that close with. i see everyone around me has made friends at uni and i feel like i, being in the next to last year of studies, missed out. not only that, but friends that i used to rely on and never made me feel alone did me really dirty this year. went on trips that we all planned without me, left me on read for plans we made for my birthday, got mad at me because i'm no longer the type to go out and get drunk, are making comments about me behind my back...

i also realized that no one i know texts me first to make plans or even just to talk. absolutely no one. people still invite me to birthday parties and to have a coffee when they have a spare time to kill and i happen to be nearby and everyone else is busy - i can always tell because its usually people who always turn down my invitations.

people are still nice when we happen to see each other. honestly, in person, it feels like nothing happened, until i come home and i never hear from them again until the next birthday party we meet at.

i feel so alone. i've been spending all my days at home because i have no one to hang out with and it breaks my heart. i don't know what's wrong with me or why people don't want to hang out with me. i'm seriously considering seeking a mental health professional because i've never spent this long feeling so alone and i have no one to talk about this. i can't rant with people because i don't want them to hang out with me out of pitty, or talk to my parents because it breaks my heart to even consider the idea of them being sad or feeling pitty over their adult daughter who doesn't have even one friend.

i'm wondering, has anyone been through something similar? if so, what did you do, what helped?
