Basically i have been suffering ever since i was 16 after having a thyroid disease. I recovered now but i have chronic muscle pain, muscle twitches, painful period pain, dizzyness, restless leg syndrome, ibs, tmj and jaw problems bladder issues and brain fog( everyday) The hardest part of my days is an hour or two after getting up all my body is in pain and i don’t feel rested after a long sleep and i have to atleast have 2 shots of coffee and a painkiller so i can work. I feel so weak and going to the gym only helps me in the same day but then i crash for a week or two generally i feel so hypersensitive to my body as if there is a mild vibration/ throbbing sensation all the time inside my muscles. I went to 3 doctors after researching and one of them said i was probably just mentally exhausted or had vitmain def.( i have been taking vitamins for years and my blood work show non) The other two said they dont believe in fibromyalgia diagnosis or that if so very few people have it and not everyone with my symptoms could have them and that i just need to move more lol what . I don’t know if its not fibromyalgia what could i have? I am tired of questioning and need a solution and to stop depending on weed or pain killers. The only thing i feel like i dont resonate with is the common tender points, i feel like my whole body is tender but some parts are extra tender? I don’t want more pointless doctors visits but can someone tell me if they have a similar experience.. what could it be? What is the cure?

Materials needed, not provided: 
•clear tacky glue
•toothpick (to apply glue)
•superglue (for windows)
•scissors (+paper scrap for the last sticker that should have been paper only)
•black sharpie (for ink chips)
——————

Positives: 
1) Sturdy small pieces - Hundreds of pieces and I only had 2 breakages while putting walls together.  

2)  Hardly any outside tools needed - Didn't even need an exacto knife or tweezers.  

3)  Cool looking windows and lights

Negatives:
1) Glue - The kit has no glue included and doesn't tell you what to use.  Tacky glue won't work on the curved window. Superglue is unforgiving but needed.

2) Instruction issues - 
   a.  Glue symbols everywhere making the project pause for drying.  
  b.  Step 24 (D4->D3) is missing a glue symbol.
  c.  They want major windows glued while vertical.  This is not a good strategy when runny superglue is the only choice.  I glued while flat, which nearly damaged the flexible window pane of the front window.  But the alternative was more risky - I wanted clear windows.

3)  Breakages -
  a.  They happen at the front window/front door curvature.  The flexible accordion pieces break because the tabs are too close to them.  I superglued the breakage at the top left of the front door (pic 4).
  b.  Load bearing tab at the front window broke.  The upper right corner. The tab is too close to the thin window pane/accordion cut.  It needs pressure applied, but is in a terrible location/shape. 
  c.  There are no extra windows or accordion pieces if you mess up.  Can't help but feel the design would be safer if they made angular edges, not rounded.  Everyone who posts appears to have stress on the accordion pieces around the front door.
 
4)  Floating pieces fragile -
  a.  The roof will sag if the side is open because it has no support
  b.  The side window (pic 6) doesn't align to the wall.  Gluing it to the wall might make wires unreachable if needing service

———————

TL,DR:  The windows and front breakages are so annoying.  Challenging but doable for a first time crafter with proper glue.  ",3,1753221911.0,booknooks,0,1.0,False

Hey there, I’m Vik — 24, 6’2”, currently in the U.S., though not originally from here. I travel a lot, so I’ve gotten used to new environments, but lately I’ve been wanting something a little more grounded — a real connection, whether that’s friendship or something that grows into more.

Most nights I’m up late thanks to insomnia and way too much coffee. You’ll usually find me either reading something that pulls me in or playing video games until I realize it’s 3 a.m. I’ve been deep into Sea of Thieves lately, so if you're into that, I’d be down to team up for a game or two. I’m big on games in general — it’s one of the few things that really helps me unwind.

I’m pretty fit — I try to stay active even if I’m not always in the mood — and I’ve got a soft spot for gloomy, moody weather. Overcast skies, rain tapping on the window, that quiet stillness that comes with it... those are my favorite kinds of days. Perfect setting for good conversation or just vibing in silence with someone who gets it.

I appreciate slow, natural connection. I like people who are curious, chill, and willing to share their weird interests or obsessions without holding back. If that’s you, let’s talk — or better yet, sail a ship through stormy waters and see how our teamwork holds up.

Would love to get your views on how to refine it and ifs its any good enough to continue.

**Intro: The Whisper from the Void**



Earth, 2256. A Type I civilization gleaming under the captured fury of the sun. Vast energy anchors, like titanic obsidian thorns, pierce the atmosphere and lunar regolith, channeling stellar fire into the veins of a world that long forgot the grime of fossil fuels. From orbit, the planet hums – a jewel threaded with light, its scars of old nations still faintly visible beneath the shimmering grid of sustainable megacities and preserved wild zones. Above it all, the **Terra Council** holds the reins. Ten presidents, their power amplified by legions of advisors and algorithms, rule not just continents but planets from their orbital sanctums. Their gaze extends to the Moon, now a fortress of secrets designated L**SRF (Lunar Science Research Facility**), and to Mars, the **Red Riviera**, a fully terraformed playground sculpted by unimaginable wealth, where Earth's elite bask under an engineered sky, far removed from Terra's watchful eyes.



Privacy? A carefully curated illusion. Corporations under Terra's umbrella and the Council's own apparatus know the heartbeat of every citizen, the consumption patterns, the movement vectors. Yet, layers of near-impenetrable encryption, the digital moats of the powerful and paranoid, shield the \*most\* sensitive data vaults. It’s a world of total visibility, fractured by islands of profound darkness.



On the Moon, within the labyrinthine, older sectors of the LSRF – far from the gleaming quantum stacks of the **\*\*Global Computational Facility (GCF)\*\*** where the frantic race for light-speed travel consumes resources and ambition – lies the **\*\*Cosmic Calculation Division (CCD)\*\***. Dust motes dance in the stale, recycled air of its dimly lit corridors. Founded on a dream in 2200, a former director's flight of fancy about using the galaxy itself as a computer, the CCD had become a byword for obsolescence. Fifty-six years of theoretical dead ends and simulations that crawled like glaciers had relegated it to the basement of priorities, its budget a rounding error compared to the GCF's voracious appetite. Its team: ten souls, brilliant minds sidelined by politics, misfortune, or social awkwardness, tending to a dream deemed impractical.



Among them is \*\*Dr. Aris Thorne\*\*. Not a rebel, not a visionary zealot, just a man whose sharp mind was blunted by a superior's grudge and dumped into the CCD's quiet despair. His office is a testament to neglect: flickering panels, mismatched furniture scavenged from decommissioned labs, the persistent hum of overtaxed life support the only constant companion, especially on the long night shifts. His current project? The **\*\*""God Simulator"" (GS)\*\***. More academic exercise than divine instrument, it was conceived in 2218 as a pet project – a system to model complex global interactions. \*What if?\* But modeling a planet, let alone the butterfly-wing chaos of human interaction with trillions of variables, required computational power that didn't exist. The GS ran on painfully limited, sanitized dummy datasets – a toy universe. A monument to 'what could be, if only...'



The 'only' was the **Deep Space Computational Satellite Network (DSCSN)**. CCD's white whale. A constellation of probes flung towards galactic centers, designed not to observe, but to \*harness\*. The theory: use the chaotic ballet of gas clouds swirling around supermassive black holes, the quantum foam of spacetime itself on a galactic scale, as a natural, universe-spanning processor. Decades of calibration, signal degradation, and cosmic static had yielded nothing but frustration and derisive reports from the GCF-focused LSRF brass.



\*\*The Night:\*\*



Aris rubbed his eyes, the glow of his display array painting tired lines on his face. Outside the thick viewport, the silent, grey desolation of the lunar surface stretched towards the impossible brilliance of Earth. Another night shift. Another round of tweaking simulation parameters on the GS using the same stale datasets, watching predictable outcomes unfold. The GCF, kilometers away in the newer complex, thrummed with purpose. Here, the only sound was the hum and the occasional sigh.



Then – a chime. Soft, almost hesitant. A notification icon pulsed in the corner of his primary display. Not a system alert. Not a comms ping. It was tagged \*\*DSCSN - PRIORITY ALPHA\*\*.



Aris blinked. Alpha? That designation was theoretical, reserved for… He leaned forward, fingers suddenly cold. He called up the diagnostic feed from the Network Operations console. Streams of data flowed – complex, chaotic, beautiful. Gravitational lensing metrics from NGC 5128. Magnetohydrodynamic fluctuations from the heart of M87. Entanglement signatures from the Sagittarius A\* accretion disk... but now, intertwined, was something new. A coherent signal. A computational pulse.



He ran the verification protocols. Once. Twice. Thrice. His breath hitched.



\*Pattern recognition: Optimal.\*

\*Signal-to-noise ratio: Within predicted tolerances.\*

\*Computational coherence: Established.\*

\*Processing yield: Exceeding Model Gamma projections by 10\^8...\*



The DSCSN wasn't just \*detecting\* cosmic phenomena anymore. It was \*integrating\* it. It was \*calculating\*. The galactic computer was online.



For a moment, Aris sat frozen, the immensity of the void outside mirroring the sudden chasm opening in his understanding. Fifty-six years. Generations of theoretical work. Mocked. Sidelined. And it had just… \*worked\*. On his watch. In this shabby office.



A tremor ran through him, part disbelief, part electric thrill. He pushed back from the console, the chair scraping loudly in the sudden silence. He didn't think of FTL, of the GCF, of the Council, or even of the implications. He thought of the God Simulator. The dusty, underpowered academic toy.



Moving with a speed born of nervous energy, he navigated the familiar interface. He loaded the GS core. Then, with a reverence he hadn't felt in years, he initiated the \*\*Level Z\*\* connection protocol. A simple test routine, really. It sent a command to the DSCSN: \*Disengage all other processes. Dedicate full network resources to the designated socket.\* A single, focused beam of cosmic computation.



The console screen flickered, then stabilized. A simple status readout glowed:

\`DSCSN: FULLY INTEGRATED.\`

\`RESOURCES: 100% ALLOCATED TO GS SOCKET ZETA.\`

\`AWAITING INPUT.\`



The GS interface, usually sluggish, now pulsed with latent, unimaginable power. It was still fed only dummy data, a tiny, artificial sandbox. But the engine behind it… the engine was the galaxy.



Aris reached for the \*\*AVR Headset\*\* hanging on its stand – an Augmented Visual Reality rig with basic neural-sensory interfaces. Standard issue for immersive data visualization, suddenly feeling archaic in the face of the power it was about to channel. He hesitated for only a second, staring at the simple prompt on the GS screen.



\`RUN SIMULATION? \[Y/N\]\`



His first thought wasn't grand history or personal tragedy. It was simple, almost mundane, born of the night's fatigue and the sheer need to \*test\* this impossible thing. \*What if the coffee synth in Sector 7 hadn’t malfunctioned this morning? Would the entire shift roster have cascaded differently?\* A tiny ripple in a tiny pond.



He took a deep breath of the stale lunar air, the weight of the neglected complex pressing in, the silent gaze of ten billion stars beyond the viewport. He selected \`Y\`.



Then, with hands that only trembled slightly, he lowered the headset over his eyes and ears. The world of the dingy office, the humming machines, the distant, uncaring Moon, dissolved into darkness as the seals engaged. A low thrum vibrated through the neural interface pads. In the artificial void behind his eyelids, points of light began to coalesce – not just data points, but the first simulated photons rendered by the raw computational might of swirling galaxies and devouring singularities.



Dr. Aris Thorne, forgotten researcher in a dead-end division, plugged into the universe's own processor to ask a question about coffee. He had no idea he was about to hear the universe whisper back. The God Simulator, fueled by the stars, flickered to life.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Cleveland Guardians vs. Baltimore Orioles: A Battle of Power vs. Perseverance**  
*Where the Guardians’ “Offense” Is a Slow Cooker and the Orioles’ Hitters Swing Like They’re Paying for Dinner*

The Cleveland Guardians (-136) and Baltimore Orioles (+200) clash in a matchup that reads like a math problem: *How many runs can a team scoring 3.8 per game possibly eke out against a squad that slugs like a drunken sumo wrestler?* Let’s break it down with the precision of a retired umpire on his third cup of coffee.

---

### Parsing the Odds: The Math of Desperation

The Guardians, at -136, imply a **57.4% chance to win** (per their 59.5% success rate as favorites). The Orioles (+200) suggest bookmakers see them at **33.3%**, though their 44.7% underdog win rate hints at a team that occasionally defies expectations—like a toddler who somehow solves a Rubik’s Cube while eating a sandwich.

Statistically, Cleveland’s weakness is glaring: They score the **5th-fewest runs (3.8/g)** and smash just **102 homers (20th)**. Meanwhile, Baltimore’s sluggers have clobbered **282 extra-base hits (16th)** and 11 bombs from Gunnar Henderson alone. The Orioles, however, are a managerial nightmare when underestimated—they’ve lost **26 of 47 underdog games**, which is about as reliable as a weather forecast in the Sahara.

---

### Key Players & Injuries: Cantillo’s Fastball vs. Henderson’s Home Run Derby

**Cleveland’s Joey Cantillo** starts for the Guardians, whose offense is so anemic, it makes a teakettle look like a pressure cooker. Their star, **Jose Ramirez** (19 HRs), is their lone power threat, while **Steven Kwan’s** .345 OBP is the team’s emotional crutch—like a single AA battery in a world of dead phones.

**Baltimore’s Brandon Young** takes the mound, tasked with containing a Guardians’ lineup that scores ru

I just made my first pour over today with Kalita Wave filters, an origami dripper, and some fresh beans from Trade coffee that I ground with a Baratza Encore ESP. It was okay, but it had a slightly burnt and mild taste instead of the sweet acidity, fruitiness, and juiciness that I expected and have experienced in coffee shops. I'm sure that I did a bunch of things wrong including grind size, water temperature, water ratios, etc. Wondering if anyone could lead me in the right direction for finding a good recipe since I feel like everything I've looked for online is tailored towards hot pour over.

I just havent been online recently as ive been traveling. To people who seen my last post in here about the balloon basically youd already know i live with my mom and sister, but to thise who dont, yea i live with my mom and sister. I initially posted on here to document my experiences so i could reread them if i needed to but also because i coukd get input, i always post them right afterwards it happens so theres no memory loss. For context to this situation, a few weeks ago i bought a new deodorant because i was running short, and i bought it as the last one in the store with the old bearglove design before old spice redesigned it. It was the last one in stock with the old design. Well i used it and left it on the coffee table in the living room and when i went to grab it the next fay it was gone, and my mom is a big clean freak so i figured she moved it. She moves things around a lot. She swears up and down she didn’t touch it so i didn’t press her on it. Shes always honest when she does and when she does she always tells me where she relocated it to. I asked my sister and she also said no. My sister is 12 so i didn’t think she would’ve, she wouldn’t have a reason to steal my deodorant. Especially since she doesnt like men’s deodorant anyway. Whatever, so me and my mom looked up and down for it for like three hours and nothing. It wasnt anywhere. We had a trip down to my grandparents the next day, (last friday) anyway so i knew id buy a new one when we got there. Its in a different state and my moms family lives way out in the sticks on a farm, but my dads family lives near a walmart 45 minutes away from my moms family, my dads family lives in a small town. Its in Mississippi. Anyway so we buy a new one and its all fine, i stopped worrying about it and it was planned we only stay for the weekend but we hardly see them so we ended up deciding on the spot to stay an extra week because my dads family is super welcoming and my moms family is strict and complains how she never sees them despite us living up in memphis and my mom works full time, whereas they are retired. Anyway we stay with my dads family for the week, my mom comes back up Saturday and drove us all the five hours home yesterday. I got home yesterday and seen my mom cleaned my room, im naturally pretty disorganized but my mom really hates it, so she cleans my room up even if i already have, or she will do it while im gone. Its just her preference she likes to do it her own way so i let her, she pays for the house and i clean as she asks me to but she likes to clean so she does it anyway. So i come home and put my stuff down on the floor which was completely spotless, i made a bit of a mess unpacking and went to bed. She came home at lunch today and asked me to clean up so i did that, i cleaned up the few pieces of clothes on the floor and put my backpack shit back in my backpack, my new deodorant that i bought to replace the old one was on the floor because last night i had unpacked my backpack, and i have a bad habit of tossing shit on my bed so when im feeling lazy i can just grab it without having to get up, i toss it in the middle of my bed then leave my room to piss, and when i came back i seen my deodorant on the floor, which i knew damn well id tossed it on my bed, so i picked it up to put it on my bed but i was like wait a damn second. It was the old deodorant with the old bearglove design. My new one was still on the bed. I feel like im fucking crazy because this has happened before and the missing item always reappears in a place that is so obvious and open that nobody could NOT notice it for the duration of it being gone. For reference i was (and am as im writing) home alone. And my mom as i said had cleaned my room and when i texted her she said she hadnt found it over the week i was gone, shes obviously aware of the weird stuff that happens because shes seen for herself plates fly out of our cabinets while shes turned around. We keep our plates flat like you would while serving food on them so it shouldn’t be possible especially because sometimes its a plate from the middle of the stack and all the rest that were on top of them would’ve come out when the one that falls did. Anyway i got off track, but my deodorant reappeared impossibly while i was out of the room for like two minutes and home alone. I don’t know what to do, my family believes me because they see it too, but the non believers are always like “its the wind” “maybe you just didn’t see it there” but i know damn well with the order of events and how my room looked before i found it that it would be impossible for me to have not seen it. And even if i hadn’t seen it my mom definitely would’ve. And she told me she hadn’t found it while cleaning my room. Does anyone have any advice on this? Could this be some kind of weird neurological memory loss thing? I doubt it though since I remember everything from the last few days and weeks just as they happened plus my mom and sister are witnesses and agree they remember it exactly as i did. Any and all comments are welcome as well as questions. I think i just want reassurance that im not crazy, but im definitely open to questions since i like to answer questions about my paranormal experiences. I like this subreddit because the other paranormal ones have weirdly specific rules that sometimes make my kind of post violate the guidelines and i don’t like jumping hoops to post my damn story and not get attacked by mods. This subreddit was welcoming in my last post (my first one, about the balloon) and i really like that. Anyway, i do tend to get off topic and i apologise, but this just happened like ten minutes ago and im genuinely paranoid and anxious because it just doesnt make sense to me. Also i tried to add images of how my floor looked and about the spot it was in when i came home but my phone is old and fucked so it wouldn’t let me access my camera roll.

My first international trip was at 32 years old. There had always been hang-ups prior to that.  
  
Mostly my immigration status, of course. Then money. Then time. Then money again.  
  
Then life clicked into place. A steady job, an American husband, and an income that once felt unimaginable.  
  
Travel became accessible. Since then, I’ve seen twenty-five countries and the entirety of the United States.  
  
A travel blog that documents these trips has amassed a loyal following and that in turn has allowed for even more adventures. I think you’d find it funny. The girl who never liked pictures with a job that revolves around a camera.  
  
These trips have taken me to the most beautiful places.   
  
I swam in Oahu. I drove across Ireland, from Dublin to Galway. I hiked to Machu Picchu.    
  
I also visited your hometown. Not by the coast, not a land of green, but beautiful in its own way.  
  
I found that small one bedroom house, just across the border, where you grew up. The new owner was kind enough to allow a small tour.  
  
My husband played soccer with the kids outside. The same clouds of dust you must’ve seen, rising with every swift kick. Different than the damp, sweet earth and green grass they’re used to—but I think they liked it.   
  
They liked the food most of all. My meals at home are simple. You know I always hated cleaning the kitchen—no fried goods there. In your town, they stuffed themselves with mole, flautas, and carnitas. We visited the local panaderia every night, went back to a hotel to dunk the warm conchas in milky coffee.  
  
Of course, the place was different from the pictures you’d shown me. But the presence of your childhood was palpable, and it rattled me to my core.   
  
I saw the streets you ran through. The trees you climbed. I was in the place where you formed your first hopes and dreams. And where, ultimately, you had to let those go in order for the child in your belly to have a better chance at her own.  
  
My dreams were always simple though—I had simply inherited yours. They included stability and safety. And you always provided that for me.  
  
There was, however, always a single unspoken want of yours I never understood.  
  
Your Parisian obsession. Back then, I don’t think you could’ve told me what country Paris was in, but you loved the idea of it nonetheless.   
  
I remember your pink powder room. The lace-like wallpaper and the delicate Eiffel Tower-shaped soap bars you never let me use.   
  
The kitchen was filled with colorful wooden planks that read “Ooh-la-la” and “Bon Appétit.”  
  
One Christmas, you specifically asked for a red beret. Not to wear, but to frame.   
  
It sits in my office now, still pinned inside the dollar store frame.   
  
That was the only dream of yours I couldn’t achieve while you were still here.  
  
When my husband and I started traveling, years after you’d passed, France was the last place on my list.   
  
I couldn’t see myself there without you.  
  
So instead, I’d think of you in another life. One where someone had given you the same opportunities you’d given me. Maybe in that life you wouldn’t be my mother. Maybe you’d be a young woman in Paris, all on her own. Spending your days flirting with French men, eating cheese and bread by the Seine.  
  
I know you were happy with your choices. But I also know that the burden of survival was a heavy weight for you to bear.  
  
I feel guilty and grateful every day thinking of the sacrifices you made for me.  
  
So, though it feels bittersweet, I decided to accomplish that last dream of yours.  
  
I’m in Paris, mom. And I got you a present for your collection.  
  
Love always,  
Your daughter

In the US, it's always south for the winter, but why have her say north for the winter? It's because Equestria Girls is set in the southern hemisphere where spring starts in September, summer starts in December, fall starts in March and winter starts in June.

Yes, I had only 3 hours of sleep and 12 cups of coffee, but that's not important. I'm telling you, they're in the southern hemisphere!",5,1753220661.0,mylittlepony,0,1.0,False

I currently own a Delonghi Dinamica Plus, coming from Nespresso.. But I'm still unhappy with espresso quality. Find it to wattery, and unbalanaced, wether too sour or bitter. Can't find the sweet spot.

I'm also disappointed with Latte Crema. Milk is not creamy (despite whole milk) but like foamy.

I know an external grinder with good coffe machine is the graal but I can't for many reasons :  
\- Not enough place  
\- Not enough time to practice  
\- Family members still want quite an easy to use machine

Therefore I'm looking forward Breville Oracle Jet. But a question remains : Will I really get better coffee/espressos ??

Has anyone such a move ? I'm interested.

Thanks for any advice.

After many attempts (and some embarrassing failures), I've learned that it's not just about throwing random items together.

First, let's talk about coffee tables themselves. If you're in the market for a new one, I found some great options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables. The right table makes all the difference in your styling journey.

When it comes to books, I always follow the rule of three. Stack three large, hardcover books - preferably art, photography, or design books with beautiful covers. I arrange them from largest to smallest, creating a visually pleasing pyramid effect. The colors should complement your room's color scheme.

Trays are game-changers for organizing smaller items. I use mine to group things like remote controls, coasters, and small decorative objects. This prevents the table from looking cluttered while keeping everything accessible. Metal trays add shine, while wooden ones bring warmth.

Here's my foolproof formula:
- One large tray (about 1/3 of the table surface)
- 2-3 stacked books
- One small plant or flower vase
- One decorative object (I use a vintage brass figurine)

The key is maintaining negative space. Don't feel pressured to fill every inch. I leave about 40% of my table surface empty, which makes the styled portions stand out more.

If you're starting fresh and need a new coffee table to style, check out these options: https://explorehonedeals.com/coffee-tables. I've found that tables with a simple design work best as they let your styling shine.

Remember to rotate your books and switch up your decorative items seasonally. This keeps your space feeling fresh without requiring a complete overhaul. I change my coffee table styling about every three months, using what I already have at home.

The most important thing I've learned is that less is more. Start with a few key pieces and build from there. Your coffee table should be both functional and beautiful, not just a display case.

I always ensure there's enough space for actual coffee cups and maybe a small snack plate. After all, it's still a coffee table, not a museum exhibit. The best styling is one that enhances your daily life rather than getting in the way of it.",1,1753220366.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Some stuff:

Early 30s, so I'm not looking to party, but I'm also single and don't want to be in the suburbs. I'd like to live somewhere I can easily get to food/coffee/etc, and next to public transport. I've always lived in small towns so I'd like somewhere that feels extra safe to walk home at night. I won't have a car (do people bike in Chicago or is it too cold?)

It needs to be trans friendly - I'm finally getting out after a lifetime of red states, and it would be a breath of fresh air to have somewhere I could relax and not be looking over my shoulder.

My absolute maximum is $1800 for a loft/1 bedroom (would prefer 1 bedroom). I'd like to have laundry in building and good heat/air. Is this a reasonable price?

I've seen people talk about Lincoln Park and Lakeview, but I don't know the differences between them. Safety and walkability are my main priorities. Thanks for reading

It's easy to dismiss them as insignificant, but when you start actually measuring their drain, you realize how much they're costing you.It's like a slow leak in a tire; you don't notice it right away,but eventually,you're flat.

This pet would benefit from individualized attention with a foster, adopter or rescue partner.
Shelter Observation
07/18: Toofless was calmly lying in his bed when I approached his kennel but quickly rose to greet me with gentle sniffs. He was easy to leash and walked great; only stopping a few times to sniff his neighbors through the door. Outside he pottied immediately and spent his time exploring and sniffing. He is treat motivated and takes them gently. He accepts affection and pets but doesn't seek it out. He was only slightly jumpy but was still very gentle. He has a very calm and sweet demeanor.

I (27F) recently got engaged and went on a trip with one of my friend groups. Not an engagement related trip but a regular girls trip.

We agreed on renting a car and  payed in full and up front (it was agreed before hand by everyone -I would be driving). On the day of the trip- my friend(24f), expressed she wanted to drive and said she would pay extra for being an additional driver.  This basically became an additional charge of 150 bucks which she would pay and NOT the group. We picked up the car and she preceded to hoard the car keys by attaching them to her wallet. 

We first needed to drive to the coast (2 hour drive), she asked the group to stop multiple times for coffee and food. During these stops she would ask if she could take over bc of the time that had passed. She kept saying things like “i drive long distances all the time”. I said, “no”. Again, we agreed I would drive the full 2 hours. After this constant stopping and questions - I was able to complete the drive. I picked up the hotel keys and she kept the car keys. 

She essentially made it so all trip I would have to ask her for the keys if I wanted to go anywhere with anyone. In addition, she would offer to drive but DRINK as the designated driver. Forcing me to stop drinking and become the designated driver. 

The rest of the days she refused or made it impossible for me to drive. Our passengers started getting car sick when she drove which annoyed me. Throughout the trip she gave me multiple back handed compliments like “whoever does your balayage does a great job, especially for how grown out it is” and “I got this keratin treatment to make my hair look like yours”. Just fucking creepy asf

Lastly, after we dropped off the car. We headed to the airport to find somewhere to eat and she said the place I picked only had 2.6 reviews and she could find something better. The place she found had 2.7 stars 🤣
I went along with it. 

I had to call my family in the middle of our meal because my mother was having an emergency. I proceeded to have that call. When I headed back to the group- no one had asked if I was okay and were more distracted/shit talking another girl they know. Because of this lack of emotional connection -I explained I needed to go to my gate, hugged everyone and proceeded to tell them I had fun. The 24f girl asked me multiple times if she could help and if I was okay. I said- I was okay and to let me handle it by myself. These girls all had their flight in an entirely different gate and FAR away from mine. Like multiple steps or walk would have to happen to reach my gate. The 24f friend proceeded to follow me - after I had told her I needed space to eavesdrop on my call with my family. I SAW HER, I simply didn’t acknowledge her and finished my call. 

I flew back home. She texted me if she could visit me and stay at my place which I was politely blunt and said: “ i noticed you eaves dropping on my conversation and this crossed the line with me. I do not feel comfortable hosting you in my home. I appreciate your friendship but will need space at this time” 

She did not deny eavesdropping but rather said : “To be honest, I’d like to clear up the air and understand what you are referring to? I don’t think I overheard anything or recall sharing any information with your mom/family when asked at the airport” 

I texted back “ no need. Thank you” 

Also- the car rental cost she said she would cover: every other girl paid for it and I put my foot down that the 24f should cover it.

Anyone else dealt with this? Week 1-3 no change, week 4 amazing progress I hadn’t felt in years with a few bad moments a few times a day, week 7-8 horrible like back to square 1, then two amazing days better than they had been before and then being just horrible again for 2 weeks to present’

I’m looking for people who’ve been through or heard of something similar. I feel completely alone in this experience and I want to know if others have come out the other side. Here’s my story, summarized:

-2019: Had a massive panic attack that triggered severe DPDR (derealization/depersonalization). I had had derealization for years that would come in waves from a bad weed experience when I was 16. This time was different- Couldn’t leave my room for months. Quit my job, started therapy, thought it was just mental health. I had horrible nonstop looping thoughts like- I would notice that I was watching something and hyper vigilant and aware of where I was looking on my phone or tv, aware of everything my brain was doing etc.

-2020-2022: Started to get a bit better. Discovered PMR and meditation which kept me functional but barely. Buy and large the looping would go away. Still had anxiety cycles, intrusive thought loops occasionally when the DPDR would get worse and when I started doing PMR and meditating again they would eventually subside. It took about a month of consistent PMR to start working toward periods of relief but it would always come back. Winters were always worse - looking back, I now suspect vitamin D deficiency + stress were making my nervous system fragile and I was just interpreting it as DPDR being the issue. Because I could mediate and gain some relief, I could live with it. Meditation would stop working as well in the winter and I notice I would get these insane crazy thought loops and then when spring/ summer would happen I would be exercising in the sun again and it would go away. I did notrealize I had likely absorption or nutritional issues yet and thought I just had to wait out doing PMR to get my DPDR to go away.

-Late 2023 - 2024: I had an extreme intrusive thought while meditating and everything collapsed. Up to that point I had literally been doing the best I ever had for a few months. Meditation stopped working entirely - instead of calming me, it triggered anxiety attacks. My body couldn’t down-regulate at all anymore. Started having extreme intrusive thoughts (including violent visuals I’d never had before, extreme fear of becoming a pedophile). No relief, no windows, constant looping fear that would latch onto and obsess over anything for 2 years straight. I have ASD and my therapist told me she didn’t think it was OCD but just perseveration but nothing was working. My nervous system felt completely hijacked, I was having all these physical issues but I thought they were all just a result of mental turmoil and stress and not the other way around. I never suspected it could be physical. I remembered those looping thoughts getting worse during the winter no matter how on top of PMR and meditation I was and think maybe that was now just a disregulated nervous system from low vitamin D

-Late 2024: Started getting sick constantly (every month or two) for two weeks and bedridden, and I started to suspect I had a vitamin deficiency. My brain was just not working right so I never went to the doctors to get bloodwork, as I would do a Telehealth for antibiotics and stuff every time I got sick and they never mentioned how often I was getting sick. After starting a centrum for men multivitamin I stopped getting sick, and it had about 1k IU vitamin D in it. I continued to be chronically fatigued, couldn’t think straight, couldn’t calm down. Calming my body would make everything worse. Late 2024 I quit my job again and lived off my savings deciding I wanted to finally figure this out.

-2025 I quit coffee cold turkey (which I had done a few times in years earlier) thinking it could be making things worse and experienced the worst thought looping and obsessive insanity I’ve ever felt. 5 weeks in it was not getting better and just getting worse. I was getting horrifying suicidal visions which were terrifying me, waking up early in the morning with a terror and unable to go back to sleep. I had never felt anything like this before and couldn’t believe what was going on. I started drinking coffee again (which I suspect had been just barely pushing me through my days). I finally hit rock bottom and  decided to get bloodwork (remember I didn’t believe it could possibly be physical): Vitamin D was 29 even after a year of taking 1k IU inconsistently. Magnesium low-normal.

Started supplementing Vitamin D3 and Magnesium consistently (5k → 10k IU). I felt the same until weeks 4-7, I finally felt some relief: my anxiety started to subside a bit, intrusive thoughts started to become more bearable, the thought looping wasn’t quite so awful. It physically felt like my body itself was going through changes and calming down. I was going through a few mood shifts a day, which was still confusing but I assumed it would just take time for my nervous system to accept relaxation and rewire mentally. I would have a bad day or two and then have generally better ones, I had a really terrible week from 7-8 where I went back to feeling how I had before supplementing but then after that I got two days that were the best I’d had in years.

Then, like a switch flipped around week 8: I already was having a bad day or two and I cut it back from 10k to 5k iu. During this phase •	Severe looping thoughts •	Morning panic •	Physical terror •	Zero windows of clarity •	Can’t meditate without triggering anxiety

Been back on 10-15k IU now for 5 days (week 10.5 total supplementing). I intend to go back to the doctor and get bloodwork again soon to see where my D levels are and get a full blood panel- test everything and anything. I’m stuck in what feels like a horrible 2+ week wave of terror, hoping that eventually this will calm down again. I keep seeing people talk about nervous system healing being non-linear, about windows and waves, but I don’t know if anyone else has had it this extreme.

What I’m Asking: •	Has anyone had recovery waves this severe, with windows of clarity that then vanish for sometimes weeks when replenishing a vitamin? •	Is it normal for the “wave” to get worse for weeks even when you’re doing everything right? •	Did anyone else’s nervous system react this violently to recovery attempts? •	Does this eventually stabilize? What doctor or specialist deals with this? I can’t find where to go from people I trust or online.

I’ve been told this is nervous system recalibration, and I want to believe it. But right now, it feels impossible. I get after literally years of dealing with nonstop anxiety and thought looping it will take time to undo it. I was absolutely without question having better spells in little bits here and there which I hadn’t felt literally in years in the last 10 weeks, and generally I’m still doing a bit better than before. But I don’t even know what doctor to go to to talk about this and it’s really hard to tell if the research I’m doing is accurate (C***GPT keeps affirming this ‘windows and waves’ thing which I thought was just for drug addiction, and I’m extremely skeptical of everything it says). I want to make sure this is actually real.

I'm trying to find somewhere that has a quick commute/walk to their Lincoln Park campus (I think this is where the art programs are) so that I can dip in and out multiple times a day if needed. Some stuff:

Early 30s, so I'm not looking to party, but I'm also single and don't want to be in the suburbs. I'd like to live somewhere I can easily get to food/coffee/etc, and next to public transport. I've always lived in small towns so I'd like somewhere that feels extra safe to walk home at night. I won't have a car (do people bike in Chicago or is it too cold?)

It needs to be trans friendly - I'm finally getting out after a lifetime of red states, and it would be a breath of fresh air to have somewhere I could relax and not be looking over my shoulder.

My absolute maximum is $1800 for a loft/1 bedroom (would prefer 1 bedroom). I'd like to have laundry in building and good heat/air. Is this a reasonable price?

I've seen people talk about Lincoln Park and Lakeview, but I don't know the differences. Safety and walkability are my main priorities. Thanks for reading",3,1753219991.0,chicagoapartments,2,1.0,False

I’m looking for people who’ve been through or heard of something similar. I feel completely alone in this experience and I want to know if others have come out the other side. Here’s my story, summarized:

-2019: Had a massive panic attack that triggered severe DPDR (derealization/depersonalization). I had had derealization for years that would come in waves from a bad weed experience when I was 16. This time was different- Couldn’t leave my room for months. Quit my job, started therapy, thought it was just mental health. I had horrible nonstop looping thoughts like- I would notice that I was watching something and hyper vigilant and aware of where I was looking on my phone or tv, aware of everything my brain was doing etc.

-2020-2022: Started to get a bit better. Discovered PMR and meditation which kept me functional but barely. Buy and large the looping would go away. Still had anxiety cycles, intrusive thought loops occasionally when the DPDR would get worse and when I started doing PMR and meditating again they would eventually subside. It took about a month of consistent PMR to start working toward periods of relief but it would always come back. Winters were always worse - looking back, I now suspect vitamin D deficiency + stress were making my nervous system fragile and I was just interpreting it as DPDR being the issue. Because I could mediate and gain some relief, I could live with it. Meditation would stop working as well in the winter and I notice I would get these insane crazy thought loops and then when spring/ summer would happen I would be exercising in the sun again and it would go away. I did notrealize I had likely absorption or nutritional issues yet and thought I just had to wait out doing PMR to get my DPDR to go away.

-Late 2023 - 2024: I had an extreme intrusive thought while meditating and everything collapsed. Up to that point I had literally been doing the best I ever had for a few months. Meditation stopped working entirely - instead of calming me, it triggered anxiety attacks. My body couldn’t down-regulate at all anymore. Started having extreme intrusive thoughts (including violent visuals I’d never had before, extreme fear of becoming a pedophile). No relief, no windows, constant looping fear that would latch onto and obsess over anything for 2 years straight. I have ASD and my therapist told me she didn’t think it was OCD but just perseveration but nothing was working. My nervous system felt completely hijacked, I was having all these physical issues but I thought they were all just a result of mental turmoil and stress and not the other way around. I never suspected it could be physical. I remembered those looping thoughts getting worse during the winter no matter how on top of PMR and meditation I was and think maybe that was now just a disregulated nervous system from low vitamin D

-Late 2024: Started getting sick constantly (every month or two) for two weeks and bedridden, and I started to suspect I had a vitamin deficiency. My brain was just not working right so I never went to the doctors to get bloodwork, as I would do a Telehealth for antibiotics and stuff every time I got sick and they never mentioned how often I was getting sick. After starting a centrum for men multivitamin I stopped getting sick, and it had about 1k IU vitamin D in it. I continued to be chronically fatigued, couldn’t think straight, couldn’t calm down. Calming my body would make everything worse. Late 2024 I quit my job again and lived off my savings deciding I wanted to finally figure this out.

-2025 I quit coffee cold turkey (which I had done a few times in years earlier) thinking it could be making things worse and experienced the worst thought looping and obsessive insanity I’ve ever felt. 5 weeks in it was not getting better and just getting worse. I was getting horrifying suicidal visions which were terrifying me, waking up early in the morning with a terror and unable to go back to sleep. I had never felt anything like this before and couldn’t believe what was going on. I started drinking coffee again (which I suspect had been just barely pushing me through my days). I finally hit rock bottom and  decided to get bloodwork (remember I didn’t believe it could possibly be physical): Vitamin D was 29 even after a year of taking 1k IU inconsistently. Magnesium low-normal.

Started supplementing Vitamin D3 and Magnesium consistently (5k → 10k IU). I felt the same until weeks 4-7, I finally felt some relief: my anxiety started to subside a bit, intrusive thoughts started to become more bearable, the thought looping wasn’t quite so awful. It physically felt like my body itself was going through changes and calming down. I was going through a few mood shifts a day, which was still confusing but I assumed it would just take time for my nervous system to accept relaxation and rewire mentally. I would have a bad day or two and then have generally better ones, I had a really terrible week from 7-8 where I went back to feeling how I had before supplementing but then after that I got two days that were the best I’d had in years.

Then, like a switch flipped around week 8: I already was having a bad day or two and I cut it back from 10k to 5k iu. During this phase •	Severe looping thoughts •	Morning panic •	Physical terror •	Zero windows of clarity •	Can’t meditate without triggering anxiety

Been back on 10-15k IU now for 5 days (week 10.5 total supplementing). I intend to go back to the doctor and get bloodwork again soon to see where my D levels are and get a full blood panel- test everything and anything. I’m stuck in what feels like a horrible 2+ week wave of terror, hoping that eventually this will calm down again. I keep seeing people talk about nervous system healing being non-linear, about windows and waves, but I don’t know if anyone else has had it this extreme.

Beyond simple apparel, these personalized garments offer a tangible canvas for showcasing logos, designs, and messaging.

This review examines the best options available, focusing on factors like fabric quality, customization options, printing techniques, and overall value.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and features of custom pocket tees vary significantly depending on the manufacturer and materials used. Key specifications that define the overall quality and suitability should be carefully examined.

**Fabric Composition and Weight**

The Fabric used in the construction of a pocket tee directly impacts its comfort, durability, and printability. Higher-quality tees typically feature 100% combed ringspun cotton, known for its softness and minimal shrinkage after washing. The weight of the fabric, measured in ounces per square yard, also determines its overall feel and drape. A mid-weight fabric (around 5-6 oz) strikes a good balance between comfort and durability, ideal for everyday wear. Blends, incorporating polyester, can enhance wrinkle resistance and colorfastness, but may affect the print's vibrancy.

**Pocket Construction and Placement**

The Pocket is more than just an aesthetic addition to the tee; it needs to be functional and well-constructed. Look for reinforced stitching at the pocket's corners to prevent tearing or unraveling under stress. The pocket's placement is also crucial.It should be centered horizontally and vertically and evenly aligned with the shoulder seam for a balanced look. The size of the pocket should be appropriate for the tee’s size to maintain a pleasing proportion.

**Print Quality and Durability**

The Quality of the printed design is paramount for any custom tee. Screen printing remains a popular choice, offering vibrant colors and good durability, especially for bulk orders. Direct-to-garment (DTG) printing is an excellent option for intricate designs or small quantities, as it allows for a wider range of colors and gradients. However, DTG prints may not be as durable as screen prints over time. Consider the printing method and inks used to ensure your design remains vibrant and resists fading or cracking after multiple washes.**Size and Fit Options**

Availability in a wide array of sizes and fits is vital to cater to diverse customer needs. Both men's and women's cuts should be offered. Sizes spanning from XS to at least 3XL, ensure inclusivity. Also, different fit options, such as classic, slim, or relaxed, enable customers to find a tee that best complements their body frame and personal style. Providing a detailed size chart with accurate measurements is essential for online purchases to minimize returns due to sizing issues.

**Color Selection and Availability**

A Broad and varied range of colors adds substantial appeal to a customizable product. A well-stocked selection should cover a spectrum of classic neutral shades (blacks, whites, greys) to accommodate classic designs. An extended vibrant range, including shades like sky blue with pastels can also be included. The consistency of dye lots across different garment sizes is also particularly crucial to note if placing bulk orders. In such cases, even slight shade variations can become immediately apparent.

Key features of custom pocket tees include:

* High-quality fabric composition
* Durable pocket construction
* Vibrant, long-lasting prints
* Inclusive size and fit options
* Wide color availability

1m6qs4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Montana/comments/1m6qs4v/all_hat_no_cattle_utbs_review_cancel_this_festival/,All Hat no Cattle - UTBS Review - CANCEL THIS FESTIVAL,"Following my viral post, I had a lot of messages from people saying to either ignore the festival or “give it a chance”.

Well that’s rich coming from folks who don’t have to deal with the influx of people. So to prove how bad it is, I went to UTBS and tried my best to live a day like a tourist / festi-bro visitor. 

Started the day going where I suspected all the clowns go, to Vaqueros, one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Columbia Falls. Vaqueros has lovely staff and I had fantastic Chorizo Huevos and a stiff black coffee. Can’t say enough good things about the place. While I was there I saw a group of clowns dressed in the typical California outfit (shorts, T shirts, sandles), and suspected they were going to the festival. I boot checked them and they had none on, but one of the clowns wore some bright patterned cowboy shirt when his hands were soft as a babies. Clearly hasn’t shoveled horse sh*** in his life. The girls in the group also had jumbo margaritas at 11am… can’t make this stuff up 😂

Cackled a bit to myself and shook my head  before heading off to the festival.

On the drive there I saw a place called “Bryan’s Field”, packed to the brim with embarrassing festival goers who were camping. Bryan, if you’re on Reddit, you need to stop enabling this festival. Completely unacceptable actions from a local of the valley. We cannot secede to the cosplaying cowboys that ruin our valley every year. Be better.

I got to the festival around 1:30 pm and parking was not that bad. Quite busy but was nothing awful. What was awful was seeing these fake cowboys walking around like they owned the place…why not just throw some shorts and sandals on instead of trying to act like you just got off the rodeo circuit? Not to mention, it’s what, 90 degrees out? Why are you wearing that heavy outfit? I walked by some cosplayers and said “me me me more cowboy than you”, had a chuckle, and continued to the entrance. 

When I was in the venue, I brought a low chair and sat at the “big mountain” stage. Honestly will give credit that it was a beautiful venue and the music wasn’t actually the “stomp clap beer truck girl” cringe I was expecting. There was some extremely talented artists and lots of fiddle. This wasn’t a bro country festival like I thought before and like many of my fellow Redditors also thought.

However, the people were certainly bro country. A lot of them did not care about the music and were more concerned with drinking as much as humanly possible. Not only that but they were extremely obnoxious. I made a few comments to people passing by (especially to people with waders and boots on), but didn’t boot check anyone. It especially got bad around 7pm when everyone stormed the venue to see the headliners. Pretty hilarious to see all the people completely ignore the local talent / up and coming musicians to dress in their most cosplay fit and only see one show. What’s the point of even coming at that point? Ruins the spirit of the festival.

The rodeo was also a travesty. As someone who goes to the stampede every year, the local talent here is awful. Kids can’t stay on a bull if their life depended on it. Are these boys really local? Because some of them are lacking serious cahones. I think the rodeo was a pretty good example of what happened to the valley. Back in my day kids would ride the bull to the buzzer - now it seems these kids have been raised by Californian soy boys and are now softer than my nieces baby food. The rodeo was one of the worst parts of the day and was a clear indicator of the downfall of the valley.

In regards to the prices, they were extreme. I knew this going in and the whole sub knows this, so nothing really major to report. A Diet Coke ran me $4.50 which is unacceptable. I also got a  elk bratwurst which was pretty good, but ran me a pretty penny at $20. When I got up to the register I asked if the sausage also comes with an arm and a leg, they laughed it off and I went away with my meal.

As the cringe fest of bros stormed the venue for the headliner act I decided to pack up early and go home. Couldn’t take the crowds any longer and the influx of hammered people made me lose respect for the festival. Some great artists were there, but the people attending didn’t even take them in, so what’s the point.

On Monday I parked at the Cenex across from the Safeway and gave a lot of the festibros leaving a nice Montana goodbye: A smile, a wave, and a kind “get the f*** out of my town”. They were all too hungover to try any sh*** on me.

TLDR: as much as I was wrong about the artists, this festival certainly has no use. Should be cancelled and simply moved to a different field where people can drink all day, because that’s the only purpose many people had.

I’m stuck in what feels like a horrible 2+ week wave of terror, hoping that eventually this will calm down again. I keep seeing people talk about nervous system healing being non-linear, about windows and waves, but I don’t know if anyone else has had it this extreme.

⸻

What I’m Asking:
	•	Has anyone had recovery waves this severe, with windows of clarity that then vanish for sometimes weeks when replenishing a vitamin?
	•	Is it normal for the “wave” to get worse for weeks even when you’re doing everything right?
	•	Did anyone else’s nervous system react this violently to recovery attempts?
	•	Does this eventually stabilize? What doctor or specialist deals with this? I can’t find where to go from people I trust or online.

I’ve been told this is nervous system recalibration, and I want to believe it. But right now, it feels impossible. I get after literally years of dealing with nonstop anxiety and thought looping it will take time to undo it. I was absolutely without question having better spells in little bits here and there which I hadn’t felt literally in years in the last 10 weeks, and generally I’m still doing a bit better than before. But I don’t even know what doctor to go to to talk about this and it’s really hard to tell if the research I’m doing is accurate (C***GPT keeps affirming this ‘windows and waves’ thing which I thought was just for drug addiction, and I’m extremely skeptical of everything it says). I want to make sure this is actually real.

Monday, July 21st (Two New Ideas to Introduce!)

# Weather & Monday Rundown:

Note: latest edition released yesterday (Monday) 

Monday's bringing us that sweet spot of Vermont summer weather: sunny skies with temperatures hovering in the comfortable upper 60s to low 70s range. Tuesday morning will have us reaching for light jackets as temps dip into the 40s and 50s, but afternoon sunshine will warm things back to the 70s. The real heat arrives midweek: Wednesday bumps us into the 80s, and Thursday? We're talking upper 80s to low 90s with humidity making its unwelcome return. Those planning outdoor activities should note that Thursday night into Friday brings our next shot at thunderstorms, though the weekend's looking solid with partly sunny skies and mid-80s temps both days.

Tonight's absolutely perfect for those Monday evening runs happening around town. The OGE Fun Run kicks off at 6 PM at Outdoor Gear Exchange, where Kae Ravichandran leads trail enthusiasts on lakeside routes that promise sunset views without the intensity, just pure running joy for all levels. Meanwhile, Skirack has their Monday Group Runs, also at 6 PM, aiming for 3-5 miles with pace groups to match everyone's comfort zone. The ONE Farmers Market runs until 6:30 PM today, transforming the Old North End into a celebration of local flavors with Ghanaian, Laotian, and Korean prepared foods alongside the usual farm-fresh suspects. Cap off your Monday at 6:30 PM with the Odd Fellows' summer BBQ potluck on North Ave. Bring something to grill or share, expect lawn games and good vibes, no entry fee required.

Tuesday's cool morning will warm beautifully for afternoon events, starting with UVM Dining's Job Fair from 1-5 PM at Harris-Millis Complex. They're offering $18.50-$25 hourly plus an extra $3 for evening and weekend shifts, which honestly isn't terrible for Burlington. The real Tuesday action comes at 4 PM when Cars and Foam takes over Foam Brewers' waterfront, launching WOLFSGART's weeklong automotive celebration with DJs, food trucks, and what promises to be an Instagram-worthy collection of cars against our lake backdrop. Wednesday brings major community engagement opportunities: the planBTV New North End Design Workshop runs 5:30-8 PM at Hunt Middle School, where residents can shape the neighborhood's future vision and weigh in on the VT-127 path connection. Same evening, car culture continues with Sunset on Pine at The Pinery starting at 5 PM, bringing food truck mania to the Arts District. Those seeking something more refined can catch the Craftsbury Chamber Players at 7:30 PM in Colchester performing Mozart, Boccherini, and Beethoven.

Thursday's heat wave timing couldn't be better for our evening festivities. Party on the Bricks returns at 5:30 PM featuring The Blue Dahlia's multicultural sounds and Church Street Tavern's pub fare. Expect dancing in the streets and that special Burlington summer energy. South Burlington's final Nite Out of the season starts at 5:30 PM on Dorset Street, complete with fireworks and a food vendor lineup that reads like a Burlington restaurant week roster. If you haven’t been, I hope you’ll check out the season’s last one! Car enthusiasts get their third event of the week with the Brew Hop at Switchback and Burlington Beer Company starting at 5 PM, because apparently we can't get enough beautiful vehicles paired with local brews. Round out your week with Paint & Sip at Venetian Soda Lounge at 7 PM, where Jesse Snyder teaches the art of #foodp\*rn painting while DJ Grant Burton sets the mood. And for those planning their weekend: Friday brings Recharge Friday at Savu Sauna Lakeside (7:30-9:30 PM): sauna, cold plunge, N/A cocktails and DJ beats for a different kind of Friday night party that gets you home by 10 ($35/person)

Weekly Wednesday Passeggiata Deals: [https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/wednesday-passeggiata](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/wednesday-passeggiata)

Burlington's historical July averages are around 81.8 °F for highs and 61.3 °F for lows. Currently, the weather is running cooler (highs in the mid‑70s and lows in the low‑50s) though it will trend back toward the typical warm summer feel by mid‑week

# Burlington Table: Meet 5 Strangers at a Brewery (Monday, July 28th)

I’m excited to finally pass 1,000 subscribers for my Burlington newsletter! To celebrate I’m excited to launch a new idea I’ve been working on:

**Burlington Table is a new way to meet real people around a real table. Just good conversation with 5 strangers-turned-friends (6 total) over drinks at a local brewery next Monday, July 28th at 6pm. Drinking is optional, not a requirement!**

Each gathering is small, curated, and 21+ (bring ID). We'll likely be at Foam Brewers, but other breweries may be included if there's lots of interest. I'll send 10 fun icebreakers ahead of time, just in case you want help keeping the convo flowing. I do my best to balance each table by age, gender, and shared interests, so your answers help make the magic happen.

As the evening unfolds naturally, you're welcome to order food or share appetizers if the mood strikes. Whatever feels right for the group! The focus is simply on enjoying genuine connection without any agenda or timeline. Foam has great non-alcoholic beer, seltzer and soda if you're not drinking or just prefer a clear mind!

There's a suggested $5–$10 donation to cover organizing time, but it's totally free if that's not doable right now.

If you're looking for something real, this is your seat at the table.

I hope you’ll check it out and tell your friends about! **The more people that sign up the better I can match the tables**! And if you want to read more about it check out this link:

# Local News (All Links Clickable)

[**Vermont Green FC completes another comeback, move on to USL 2 Conference Championship**](https://www.mynbc5.com/article/vermont-green-fc-completes-another-comeback-move-on-to-usl-2-conference-championship/65458858?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""We keep doing it. When you've got that passion for the club, you can do anything,"" per WCAX.

The Green have mastered the art of the comeback, pulling off their third straight come-from-behind victory to advance to their first Eastern Conference Championship in program history. Down 2-0 to FC Motown in the second half, they responded with three unanswered goals, including a penalty kick winner from Julien Le Bourdoulous. Head coach Chris Taylor credits the team's culture and the passionate local community for giving them the energy to keep fighting when they're down. The momentum's real here, this team's creating something special at Virtue Field, and Friday's conference championship (opponent TBD) promises to be electric.

[**Outdoor Gear Exchange to celebrate 30 years on Church Street**](https://www.mynbc5.com/article/outdoor-gear-exchange-to-celebrate-30-years-on-church-street/65450371?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""We've built our store around community. We are community-oriented,"" per MYNBC5.

Mark your calendars for Saturday, July 26, when OGE throws what's essentially Burlington's biggest block party of the summer. Running from 11 AM to 10 PM, the celebration kicks off with a staff band at 12:30 PM followed by local musicians throughout the day. The real genius here is their raffle system: every $30 you spend leading up to the event earns you a ticket, so your gear addiction finally pays off. After three decades as a Church Street anchor, OGE has earned its place as more than just a store; it's where Burlington goes to fuel its outdoor obsession and bump into half the town doing the same.

[**Here's What Happened at Last Night's Burlington City Council Meeting (7/14/25)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/1m0eoxv/heres_what_happened_at_last_nights_burlington/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""Playing a 'relocation game' is a failed strategy,"" per Reddit/Btown Brief.

Apologies for missing this in Thursday's edition. The four-hour marathon meeting from last Monday deserves your attention. The most heated exchange centered on Food Not Cops' relocation to City Hall Park, with councilors split between those citing negative impacts and others arguing the city's playing whack-a-mole instead of addressing root causes. The ""City Circle"" restorative justice program proposal aims to fix our broken ticketing system by actually compelling engagement rather than just issuing fines that go unpaid. Meanwhile, the REIB office took a unanimous first step toward charter status, and renters finally got included in water bill assistance. Click the headline to see the full rundown, and others comments about it. And if you throughly enjoyed that rundown, be sure to check out the other complete summaries of Burlington city council meetings at [btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/city-council-summaries](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/city-council-summaries).

[**Federal cuts result in layoffs at Vermont Foodbank**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/07/20/federal-cuts-result-layoffs-vermont-foodbank/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""These are people who are doing good work and helping people, and you know, we're an organization that cares about people,"" per WCAX.

The Vermont Foodbank has laid off seven employees, nearly 9% of staff, as federal COVID funding dries up and USDA food allocations drop by 20%. CEO John Sayles assures that food distribution won't be affected, but these cuts highlight how fragile our safety net remains. The silver lining: the state Legislature allocated $1.5 million this year, and last weekend's Do Good Fest raised $210,000. Still, losing dedicated staff who've been feeding vulnerable Vermonters feels like a step backward at a time when food insecurity hasn't magically disappeared with the pandemic emergency declarations.

[**Stowe teen preps for gubernatorial race**](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/20/stowe-teen-preps-for-gubernatorial-race/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""When a kid in Vermont understands that there's a housing and affordability crisis, that's when you know it's bad,"" per VTDigger.

Dean Roy, a 14-year-old from Stowe running for governor on the Freedom and Unity Party ticket, might not unseat Phil Scott, but he's making points that resonate. The former legislative page who challenged Lt. Governor Rodgers on EVs is centering his campaign on property taxes and affordability; issues he admits seem ironic coming from someone who doesn't own property. His platform includes STR caps, a 5% tax on vacation rentals, and immigration reform. Whether you take a teenage gubernatorial candidate seriously or not, Roy's engaging his peers in politics and planning to stay on the ballot until he wins something, somewhere.

[**How the Lake Monsters kept swimming**](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/20/how-the-lake-monsters-kept-swimming/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""The level of baseball is much better than when it was a single-A, short season,"" per VTDigger.

When MLB cut the Lake Monsters loose in 2020, it could've been game over for Burlington baseball. Instead, new ownership led by Chris English rebuilt the franchise as a summer collegiate league, won a championship their first season, and created something arguably better than what we had. GM C.J. Knudsen points to Vermont players like Wyatt Cameron and Colby Brouillette as proof that local kids can now dream of playing at Centennial Field (sorry, Delta Dental Park). With local partnerships from Arlington ice cream to Barre-bottled hot sauce, plus those genius 25-cent hot dog nights that pack the stands, the Lake Monsters have transformed from minor league afterthought to must-see summer entertainment.

[**South Burlington considers paying committee volunteers under new stipend proposal**](https://www.mynbc5.com/article/south-burlington-considers-paying-committee-volunteers/65460024?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""$50 per meeting, based on attendance, and a $20 bonus for the chair of each committee,"" per MYNBC5.

South Burlington's considering joining Essex, Colchester, and Winooski in actually compensating the volunteers who keep municipal government running. At an estimated $60,000 annually, it's a recognition that asking people to donate hours of their time to review development proposals or plan city initiatives maybe deserves more than a pat on the back. The vote happens tonight at 6:30 PM, and honestly, if we want diverse voices in local government, removing financial barriers to participation seems like a no-brainer.

[**Kona Beachside brings island flavor to North Beach**](https://www.mynbc5.com/article/kona-beachside-north-beach/65454948?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""I want people to walk away feeling relaxed,"" per MYNBC5.

Just when you thought North Beach couldn't get better, Kona Beachside Tiki Bar & Grill drops a slice of Polynesia on Lake Champlain. Owner Sandi Pasagic has created what sounds like the perfect Vermont summer spot: tropical drinks and island-inspired food with waterfront views, open daily from noon to 7 PM. After years of North Beach feeling like it was missing something beyond the snack bar, this addition gives us another reason to make the trek past the bike path. Pro tip: combine this with the Saturday beach scene for peak Burlington summer vibes.

[**Rash of Kia thefts continues to plague region**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/07/18/rash-kia-thefts-continues-plague-region/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""It's like a big joke. They pose it as like a trophy,"" per WCAX.

The TikTok-inspired Kia theft trend that started three years ago is somehow still happening, with about a dozen cars stolen in the past two weeks alone. The thieves are posting videos of their joyrides on social media before abandoning the destroyed vehicles. South Burlington Police are investigating, but no arrests yet. If you own a vulnerable Kia or Hyundai, contact your dealer about the fix; and maybe invest in a steering wheel lock while you're at it. The casual cruelty of destroying someone's transportation for social media clout is particularly galling when you consider how many people are already struggling with Burlington's cost of living.

[**Public media in our region braces for budget shortfalls**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/07/18/public-media-our-region-braces-budget-shortfalls/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""In order to maintain the services we provide, we're going to ask people to give more,"" per WCAX.

Federal cuts are hitting our regional public media hard: Vermont Public faces a $4 million shortfall (10% of budget), North Country Public Radio loses $650,000 over two years, and Mountain Lake PBS takes a devastating 35% cut. Vermont Public CEO Vijay Singh acknowledges they'll need to lean even harder on already-generous Vermonters. Rep. Elise Stefanik celebrated the cuts while calling NCPR's reporting ""false and defamatory,"" while Rep. Becca Balint called it a betrayal of rural communities. Whatever your politics, losing independent local journalism and emergency broadcasting capability seems shortsighted when we're increasingly dependent on reliable information.

# Volunteer Opportunity of the Week: Burlington Community Justice Center

There are so many volunteer opportunities in Burlington! This week I choose to highlight:

Help support neighbors who’ve experienced harm by volunteering with the *Parallel Justice* program at the Burlington Community Justice Center. This role involves checking in with victims after police reports, helping them navigate the legal system, and connecting them with local resources. Whether or not someone is held accountable, you’ll be part of a community response that prioritizes healing and support. Volunteers must be 18 or older and bring empathy, professionalism, and a respect for confidentiality. Training is provided—your presence can make a real difference.

Check out this page for links to four great sites with volunteer opportunities all around Burlington: [https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/volunteer-burlington](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/volunteer-burlington)

# 202+ Things to Do in Burlington (Summer Activities)

Today’s picks:

Five more to keep things feeling easy and open as the season winds down. Start your morning at the Burlington Farmers Market on Pine Street where you can pick up local produce, baked goods, and maybe catch some live music while you browse. Take a short hike through the woods at Niquette Bay State Park and cool off with a dip at one of the quiet beaches tucked along the shoreline. Visit the Fleming Museum on the UVM campus for a calm, air-conditioned break with a thoughtful mix of art and anthropology. If you're feeling curious, head over to the World's Tallest Filing Cabinet on Flynn Avenue for one of Burlington's weirder landmarks and a good photo spot. And when the light starts to fade, walk the boardwalk at Waterfront Park and watch the boats drift in as the sky shifts over the lake

Full list’s always waiting here when you need a plan: [https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/202-activites](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/202-activites)

# This Week’s Restaurant Review: Pizzeria Verità

Pizzeria Verità has carved out a solid reputation since 2012 as Burlington's go-to spot for authentic Neapolitan pizza, complete with a wood-fired oven imported directly from Naples. The restaurant's commitment to traditional technique shows in every pie: hand-stretched dough with the signature puffy cornicione edge, quality San Marzano tomatoes, and fresh fior di latte mozzarella that's made in-house. Standout pizzas like the Mais, featuring fire-roasted Vermont corn with speck and crème fraîche, successfully bridge Italian tradition with local ingredients, while classics like the Margherita deliver the pure, simple flavors that define true Neapolitan style.

The lively, energetic atmosphere matches the open kitchen setup where diners can watch skilled pizzaioli at work, creating an engaging dining experience that feels both authentic and distinctly Burlington. Co-owners Leslie Wells and John Rao's dedication to the craft is evident: Wells trained in Italy and New York to master traditional techniques, and their emphasis on local Vermont ingredients through partnerships like the Vermont Fresh Network adds a meaningful community connection. The restaurant consistently ranks among Burlington's top dining spots, earning recognition in local ""Daysies"" awards and maintaining strong online reviews for both food quality and service.

However, Pizzeria Verità's popularity can work against it during peak times, when the bustling atmosphere tips into chaos and securing a table without reservations becomes tough. Prices run $15-20 per pizza, which can feel steep for some, but not bad compared to surrounding pizza places. The limited menu can leave some diners wanting more variety beyond the antipasti selection. The high-energy environment, while part of the appeal for many, can feel quite busy for those seeking a quieter meal, and service can become stretched thin when the restaurant hits capacity. Despite these drawbacks, Pizzeria Verità delivers on its promise of authentic Neapolitan pizza in a vibrant setting that captures Burlington's local dining scene.

1m6ql1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/DAE/comments/1m6ql1j/dae_feel_embarrassed_by_what_they_enjoy_doing/,DAE feel embarrassed by what they enjoy doing?,"I (29F) has recently noticed that everything I like feels so juvenile and childish. So much so that I would rather act like I don't like them and I just refuse to partake.

When I was a kid, I felt like I'd be in trouble doing anything. I did everything in secret. Write, draw, read, color, and especially playing. Someone would walk by or come over to me and I would immediately stop and pretend I was NOT doing what I was doing. At times when I was a kid, my father would check on me in my room and I would basically shove the toy away like I was sneaking something I wasn't supposed to have. I stopped watching cartoons when I was in middle school because I was afraid to be made fun of or told I was too old or something. I thought I was too old to do those things.

And now, brainstorming safe places and things I do that make me somewhat happy through the anhedonia. It made me feel bad about myself. And it feels like my therapist and my friends are just trying to make me feel fine about them.

Not all of them are embarrassing, but there are some that really are. I'm sure you'd spot them.

1. Blowing bubbles. This is new. I just learned you can bounce bubbles on fabric and it changed the entire game. The respite home I was at has a sign on the back door that says: Stop, before you smoke that cigarette, try blowing bubbles instead.
2. Trying to draw and color with crayons just to prove it is possible to make well blended and rendered crayon drawings and coloring pages. I don't know why. Maybe just to see if I even can.
3. Reading and annotating and making commentary on everything in a journal. It amuses me I guess to just write down every thought when I read. I am currently reading the books I have to see what I want to keep and which I will donate to schools.
4. Puzzles that don't make me feel too stupid.
5. Making slime, kinetic sand (playing around with it) and trying to make stuff out of playdough.
6. I want to make cosplays, but I am terrified to use the sewing machine because I'm scared if I break it, I won't be able to fix it.
7. Coloring on tablets because I can render better.
8. Trying to paint with watercolors or acrylic paint.
9. Lincoln logs, legos (lesser so), and those things.
10. Kick scooter stunts (trying to and failing)
11. Fingerboards.
12. Video games of course.
13. Board games that don't make me bored.
14. Dress up games and trying to design and hand sew clothes for stuffed animals.
15. Popsicle stick crafts. I want to make a wooden boat with a string for when I'm just sitting by the pool or standing around in the pool. Also watching movies in the pool when the sun goes down. (My parent's pool).
16. Crafts.
17. Roleplay online. I usually write as canon characters, but I have original characters. A lot tbh.
18. Pre-loaded handheld games. Great way to make a long train or bus ride manageable without having to doom scroll on your phone.
19. Trying to sing.
20. Drawing. Usually digital, but on paper is fun because you can't undo, redo, or zoom in... I have caught myself trying to zoom in so many times.
21. YouTube. I feel less alone watching a YouTube video than a movie.

22. Those little science kits and experiment kits.

23. RC cars and planes. I wanted to make my own version of Twisted Metal Small Brawl when I was a kid.

24. Streaming.

25. Writing. I want to write novels. I have a little universe that was inspired by Marvel and DC. I have another series (not connected though) of stories where I try to unpack trauma and hopefully open someone's eyes if they see similarities in their life or a loved ones.

26. Using old camera for photography (but not retro. Vintage, like early 2000s) & one from 2017 or so. Polaroids are cool and all, I guess.

27. Making playlists and finding new music. I make giant playlists of random songs for my mother because she likes when I help her find new artists when she can't find something new.

28. Writing fanfic and turning into original works. (Just for my friends and I -- this is so fun for roleplay ocs.) I started doing this as a way to learn how to take up more space. I wouldn't even touch self-inserts because I didn't like myself and didn't feel like I should even put myself into any story. But it's lowkey fun to write something that isn't so serious).

29. Lollygagging and aimlessly wandering. I used to get high before going to my partial hospitalization program, I would scoot there, very high in NoHo. After PHP, I would do the same until I got on the bus home.

30. Art and edit commissions. When I was active in the roleplay community, I'd make my own edits for profile layouts and I'd make some for others. Price was pay whatever you can or want to. If you can't? That is perfectly okay!

31. Learning about hobbies that don't look boring or too hard.

32. I want to make dioramas as well as make really good furniture and little sets with polymer clay for the... dollhouse I got.

33. Learn how to make wooden toys that will be biodegradable and include play prompts for children who struggle with their imagination because of the over-exposure to either pre-determined play or screens.

34. Yapping in my journal. I like to also journal stuff I do in video games. I found it opened a lot of my own dialogue about issues and what not, especially Cyberpunk 2077.

35. Walking around the planets in No Man's Sky. I used to do this once a day on the VR treadmill to just... be there. It's a comforting place.

36. I want to grow plants (esp cannabis. I want to learn how to make my own strain.)

37. Collages. I got into analog collages and digital ones. I've been using memories (old tickets, an ice cream wrapper from Japan, travel maps, coloring book pages, drawings, magazines, old children's books that are torn to pieces from being loved too much, etc.)

38. I want to make a pirate ship wheel to put on the deck to stand there to have something to fidget with while trying to at least go on the deck when I don't wanna wander around Staten Island or go to Brooklyn or SoHo/NoHo/Nolita.

39. Independent random autism adhd fixation academia. I'm thinking coffee and it's history, horticulture, optimal brewing techniques.

40. Origami. I can only make Christmas trees and paper cranes for now.

41. I wanna make little terrariums too.

42. Learning about chess. I suck playing because I choke up and panic.

43. Sewing.

44. I want to learn cross-stitching.

45. Have an entire wardrobe of Spidey suits... and Supergirl suits... and Robin suits.

46. ... Uh... playing with toy cars.

47. Uh... playing with little action figures and dolls. It's also helpful to envision scenes to see if it even makes sense or if the dialogue sounds natural.

48.  Uh... making paper dolls and drawing dollhouses and locations for them in notebooks.

49. Trying to make on paper games that can be played anywhere (in the same notebook with the dollhouses and locations).",1,1753219348.0,DAE,0,1.0,False

With two full rotations starting from the point where the I can't turn the dial anymore (falls between 1 and 2 on mine instead of 0) and for what seems to be a standard pourover setting, it takes me around 40 seconds to grind 15g of coffee. For comparison, [this reviewer](https://youtu.be/KWs80A67joc?t=334&si=V0x0LakX7_SlRH3U) is grinding much faster for apparently a similar setting and he claims that it's almost a 1g per second grinder. [This other reviewer](https://youtu.be/9mksYyPI5ZU?si=vBn__TUBqTy_fQuo) does not specify how many grams he's putting in but he seems to fill the grinder almost to the brim (so around 35g) and it's taking him 40 seconds for an espresso setting with one rotation.

Judging from these reviews and other testimonies across the web, I would expect my 15g of coffee to take no more than 20 seconds at my pourover setting. I'm actually wondering if there's something wrong with my unit... Do y'all get grind speeds as fast as in the reviews I linked? I got the grinder on Amazon by the way, I think from 1Zpresso's marketplace.

I was diagnosed with **grade 1 fatty liver** in January, with **LDL at 136** and **slightly enlarged kidneys** (no functional issues — likely from high protein + low water). I was 72 kg at 165 cm, eating \~2000 kcal and hitting the gym 4x/week.

Over the past 3–4 months, I reduced calories, added cardio & sports, and now work out 3x/week. I’m limiting **saturated fat to \~10g/day**. Most of it comes from clean sources like rapeseed oil, but at night I really **crave something fatty** — and often reach for a peanut butter bar (150 kcal, 4g sat fat, 1g sugar). Without it, I don’t feel full, even after a high-protein, veggie-rich dinner.

My current diet is something like:

* **Breakfast:** Avocado toast  or oat meal + protein yogurt + berries + coffee >>600Kcal
* **Lunch/Dinner:** 200g chicken breast, 125g brown rice, lots of veggies>> 1100Kcal

**1.Should I keep the bar (4–5g sat fat) or cut it out completely?**  
**2.Any tips to stop this late-night craving for saturated fat?**

It's just I go on the dates and find myself having shallow conversation and steering the conversations toward really dry, safe topics like family, hobbies, occupation, and food. Sometimes I feel like I am interviewing cardboard, and I am pulling my teeth out trying to make this remotely enjoyable

After some introspection I realized it is likely because I stick to these safe topics. I mean, I am bubbly and charismatic enough to get a 2nd date with pretty much 90% of girls I meet. I just feel... exhausted and not enjoying their company. I do feel like I mask heavily due to neurodivergency and should stop, but I still feel the need to come off as normal and charismatic

How do I have fun on a date? I take her to go get coffee or tea and then we go walk around the city, sure, but I don't feel anything in my soul

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a wooden bench involves careful consideration of several key aspects to ensure a lasting, comfortable, and aesthetically pleasing addition to your space.

**Material quality:** The type of wood used significantly impacts the bench's durability, weather resistance, and overall appearance.Hardwoods like teak, oak, and maple are known for their strength and resistance to decay and insect damage, making them ideal choices for outdoor benches. Softwoods like pine and cedar are more affordable but might require treatments like staining and sealing to withstand the elements. Recycled wood and engineered wood composites are also gaining popularity as lasting and durable alternatives. The grain pattern, color, and natural characteristics of the wood contribute to the bench's unique aesthetic appeal.

**Construction & Joinery:** A well-constructed bench ensures stability, longevity, and safety.

look for benches with robust joinery techniques such as mortise and tenon, dovetail, or reinforced screw connections. Check for smooth, sanded surfaces and tightly fitted joints that prevent wobbling or cracking. The thickness and dimensions of the wooden components are also essential indicators of the bench's structural integrity; thicker planks generally provide greater strength and support. Rustproof hardware, such as stainless steel screws and bolts, is critical for outdoor benches to prevent corrosion and maintain structural integrity over time.

**Design & Style:** Wooden benches come in a vast array of styles to complement various architectural designs and personal preferences.

Consider the overall aesthetic you want to achieve. Customary park benches typically feature curved backs, slatted seats, and sturdy legs. Modern designs often incorporate clean lines, minimalist profiles, and unconventional materials.Rustic benches might showcase the natural imperfections of the wood, adding character and charm. The bench's size and shape should be in proportion to the available space and intended use. A smaller bench might be suitable for a balcony or entryway,while a larger bench could be ideal for a garden or patio.

**Finish & Protection:** The finish applied to a wooden bench not only enhances its appearance but also provides crucial protection against the elements.

Exterior benches should be treated with weather-resistant finishes such as marine-grade varnishes, stains with UV inhibitors, or sealants that repel moisture and prevent fading. Interior benches can benefit from finishes like polyurethane, lacquer, or oil-based stains that protect against scratches, spills, and everyday wear. Consider the ease of maintenance when selecting a finish; some finishes require periodic reapplication or cleaning to maintain their protective properties.

**Ergonomics & Comfort:** apart from its aesthetics, a wooden bench should offer a comfortable seating experience.

Consider the height and depth of the seat, as well as the angle of the backrest if the bench has one. Some benches include contoured seats or armrests for added comfort. For outdoor benches, consider the material's ability to retain heat in direct sunlight. Benches made from darker woods or metal frames can become uncomfortably hot during sunny days. The texture of the wood's surface also contributes to comfort; smoother surfaces are generally more pleasant to sit on for extended periods.

Key features of quality wooden benches include:

* Durable hardwood construction
* Reinforced joinery techniques
* Weather-resistant finishes
* Ergonomic designs
* Variety of styles and sizes

1m6q9b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/bristol/comments/1m6q9b7/is_bristol_on_the_decline/,Is Bristol on the decline?,"For context, I’m 31 and have lived in / around Bristol my whole life.

I don’t know if it’s because I’m getting older now and my lifestyle / priorities have changed but I feel like Bristol as a whole and particularly the centre is rapidly going downhill. There seems to be so much more crime, homelessness, litter, graffiti and just the whole “vibe” feels in decline to me.

For example; twice last week, I had two different homeless men come up to the car window begging for money in an empty coffee cup when I was stopped at traffic lights. I’ve never seen this happen in Bristol before. 

I was doing work in a large office block in town and a homeless man “set himself up” right outside the revolving door to the eight storey office and laid asleep there surrounded by needles, sick, poo and who knows what else. He’s been moved along twice but keeps coming back and the poor cleaners have to keep clearing up after him (please don’t take this as me shaming homeless people, that’s not what I’m getting at).

Yesterday somebody posted a video on here in Mangotsfield of two balaclava wearing yobs on electric bikes breaking into a car in broad daylight. They knew they were being filmed but didn’t care at all because there never seems to be any repercussions. The face hidden thugs on e-bikes and scooters seem to be everywhere. One nearly knocked my 75 year old Mum over the other day and when I challenged him, he threatened to stab me. 

Let’s not even get started on all of the “new residents” on Clifton Downs who have been set up there for months now, generally making a mess, this has already been discussed in depth here.

I’m not in my early 20s going out drinking every weekend so maybe my perspective has changed but I feel very little attachment to Bristol now which is a real shame because I used to love living here.

Has anybody else noticed this trend or is it just me being miserable?

1m6q951,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brownsville/comments/1m6q951/brownsville_trip_report/,Brownsville Trip Report,"I came on here a few weeks ago asking for travel advice for Brownsville. I just got back to Los Angeles, and I'd like to give a trip report.

Background: I have been to Brownsville maybe a dozen times before. My parents retired from CA to Rancho Viejo. We hadn't seen each other for ten years, so it's been a minute since I've been in the RGV.  The purpose of the trip was the family reconnection (which went perfectly, by the way). Still, I wanted to explore a bit as well.

I went with the husband who's White and myself who's Latino, Peruvian to be exact. We're two men. He had never been to Brownsville. We're both in our early 60s and my parents are in their 80s and 90s. Both of us are fluent in Spanish. 

We left LAX at 5 a.m. By the time we landed in Harlingen, we were wiped out. That Valley heat really hits you getting off the aircraft. It had been a long time since I had been in an Embraer, I forgot how small they are. After getting the car (shout out to the very friendly guy at the car rental place who hooked us up with an upgrade), we went to La Pampa. 

We wanted a  very chill and good quality restaurant with a full bar. I got a lot of recommendations here and did a lot of research. Some of the other contenders didn't open for lunch. La Pampa was perfect. Not very full, pretty good lunch special of arrachera and a salad. We started off with the potato tortilla española. Very tasty. Good wine.

  
Right away, we noticed how friendly everyone is. It was a constant during the four days. People seem genuinely nice, chatty and helpful. People seem humble in a sense they're unassuming, respectful, and not arrogant. We really liked pretty much everyone we met in the Valley. No big city energy at all which was very refreshing.

On day one, after visiting the parents, we headed to downtown Brownsville. I've always admired the historical architecture downtown. You can definitely see that Brownsville had a boom era. The last time I was there, downtown still seemed to be geared towards the cross border traffic. This time I saw less of that.

People told me it was harder for people to cross to do shopping in Brownsville. I don't know if that's true or not. But, we did notice all the gentrification going on and the new trendy restaurants. We actually visited some of them, not to have a full meal but drinks and small bites. Here's a quick review of where we ate:

Boqueron: We were intrigued by the Spanish theme since we've both lived in Spain. We had a plate of charcuterie and I had two of an open-faced anchovy and boqueron cucumber mini half-sandwich. The food was really good and they had good wine. This is where we heard that ""Leon"" really wanted amenities like these types of restaurants for his people to feel at home.

  
Monarca Baja Kitchen: We were upstairs in the bar area both times we went there. We really liked the vibe and the super friendly and welcoming staff. We had a ceviche and some prime rib tacos. They were both excellent. Great drinks.

Centrito Botanero: By the time we ended up there, we had been eating meat every single day. We couldn't eat any more meat so we missed on having what looked like really good meat dishes. We had the guacamole which had big chunks of whole avocado in it and was served with chicharrones. Different but good. Good bartender there as well.

Ultimo Taco: Obviously not a trendy spot but I wanted to try some famous tacos in Brownsville. I know there are lots of recommendations. I just had to commit and Ultimo it was. It was buzzing in there. We got a lot of tacos to make a taco bar in the hotel room. The highlight was the caldo de birria. That was some good caldo. Tacos were good. I wanted lengua but they didn't have it. Next time, we'll go to some other taquerías.

Spent one day in McAllen. Went to Ruben's Market which has products from all over Latin America. Had lunch at Joleane's in Mercado Food Hall. That was a great space with great food options and shops. I really liked it.  I know there are other places for Texas BBQ, and in fact it wasn't that great, but I was also with my parents and they liked the buzz inside the hall.  


One morning, the husband and I crossed over to Matamoros to look around. It was early Saturday morning. Walked across the bridge, took a cab to the Plaza (100 pesos). Looked around, walked down to La Marquesa, had a coffee and took a cab back to the puente. We crossed back at the wrong bridge. Now we know what to say to get the right bridge next time. Matamoros was interesting, we'll explore a bit more next time. I never made it to the Rigo Tovar Museum. 

The Sunrise Mall had good people watching. We both liked the Browness of Brownsville. And the type of Brown people there are different from the Brown people here in LA.  I loved code switching between English and Spanish in HEB. I saw a lot of dads who were very engaged with their kids. For some reason, that really stuck out. It's definitely family oriented and I'm sure everybody knows everybody else at some point. 

I heard a lot of opinions, pro and con, about Leon but that's for another time. 

Brownsville and the Rio Grande Valley are a very special place with such a unique culture and history. I can imagine it's a nice place to grow up in and live. Thanks for having us. We loved it.",12,1753218565.0,Brownsville,4,0.93,False

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

We are both of Indian descent and are legal residents of United States. We were in California for a vacation having visited areas like San Diego, Palm Springs etc. 
Now -we were sitting in Starbucks drinking our coffee and speaking about some random topic which I don’t recall. Now we are sitting at the farthest corner in the location - a place where there is a small table and 2 chairs. 
So this woman - must be 70+ comes to us and says “You are talking very loudly, I don’t like your tone and it’s very aggressive and I want you to stop talking “ . 
Now we were stunned - there was another big group of people 5-6 sitting right at the entrance who were talking very loudly btw. There is no way - she heard us but did not hear those people. There was also a 10 feet distance between her seat and ours and unless someone is listening very intently to what we were saying there is no way that it would become a bother. 
I did not say anything to her but promptly reported this behavior to the store barista and manager. 
I’d appreciate the role of them as they immediately redressed the situation and they also spoke to that lady and came to us that this is not an ok behavior for someone to bother other guests in the cafe.

Still stunned this happens in west coast. We are from the east and we have always met friendly people wherever we went.

1m6q4mb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1m6q4mb/when_alice_met_bob_and_left_him_decrypting/,When Alice met Bob and left him decrypting,"Hi Reddit,

Bob is a dear friend, and I need your help to ease his situation. I'll give a brief ""Short Version"" first, followed by a detailed ""Long Version"" with full context.

**Short Version**  
Bob and Alice are at the same university (27M PhD, 23F Master's). They interacted casually a few times before going on two dates. The first date was good: lots of positive signals (eye contact, compliments, physical greetings). On the second date, they discussed relationships more deeply, including some past experiences. She ended by saying she'd text him to meet again after a while. She didn't. It has been 5 months, and they've run into each other occasionally since then, where her interactions have been ambiguous: friendly and inviting, yet nervous and avoidant. Should Bob reach out?

**Long Version**  
They initially met at a presentation at uni. She approached Bob, asking his thoughts and kept glancing his way afterward, giving him ""the eyes."" At another talk, she initiated a conversation and mentioned something cool she did related to that talk. He followed up over text. Later that week, at a campus party, she happened to be next to him and suggested dancing together. They held hands, jumped around, and he hugged her goodbye afterward.

A while later, he asked her out for coffee. She was away but promised to message him when back. True to her word, she messaged about 15 days later, and they arranged their first ""date.""

**First Date**: She brought homemade tea for him. They met at a campus cafe. She greeted him warmly (cheek kisses). They enjoyed tea and cookies, and had a lively conversation covering childhood, interests, etc. She showed clear attraction (""We have so much in common,"" ""You have a warrior-like spirit,"" visibly impressed). As she left early for a meeting, he expressed wishing she stayed longer. She immediately suggested meeting again, and they scheduled the next date on the spot.

**Second Date:** Another campus cafe. He brought cake he had baked last weekend, which she absolutely loved (saying, ""I love our little tea time here."") The discussion deepened around dating and relationships, and their preferences. She brought up her past relationship and became somewhat nervous and vulnerable while mentioning it. She said he seems family-oriented, asked about his marriage plans, and expressed uncertainty about her own (""I'm still young; marriage isn't something I'm considering soon""). They had a few disagreements about relationships, but it felt authentic overall. They appreciated each other's hobbies and artistic sides. At the end, he asked if she'd like to meet again. She said she'd be busy for a while but promised to text. Note that they have not yet kissed or anything. These are quick dates in public settings.

**Silence and Ambiguous Interactions**: She never messaged, but they had some unplanned interactions:

**Campus talk (one month after second date)**: As he entered the room, she was surprised and made way for him. He sat beside her and made small talk (she mentioned her recent trip). In the end, they were walking out together, but she excused herself to ""ask the speaker a question.""

**Random encounter**: Waved enthusiastically while cycling past him on the road.

**Exam**: He organized an exam, and she was invigilating. She met him in the hallway, asking which room he would be in. He was asking everyone about their duties. She wasn't fully aware and got quite nervous as she answered him. After the exam, along with other invigilators, she casually informed him about free food on campus where they were all going. They all talked for a while; she noticeably glanced at him several times.

A couple of other ambiguous interactions go by. Recently, he posted a message in a big tech group, and she liked it within the next minute. So, she is not visibly bitter. Also note that while she engages well in person, she was very short, quick, and emotionless in chat. Bob's best guess is that she might be afraid of the power dynamic, might be expecting some other sign of interest from him, or is outright uninterested from the start.

It has been 5 months since the second date. Here's Bob's perspective:

**His mistakes:**

* should have been more direct about his interest
* should have reached out a few weeks after the second date. He thought he was giving her space, and expected her to eventually text

**Why not to reach out:**

* her actions (or lack thereof) have spoken enough; she had her chance if she wanted, she flunked, let her be
* reaching out implies that he's relying on her for closure and hence may come off as desperate
* she didn't take much initiative on the dates and was always the one to leave on account of something else

**Why reach out:**

* her behavior is ambiguous, and he feels she may be willing to talk
* perhaps she wanted to reach out after a while, but couldn't break the silence and needs a nudge
* it is mature to close the loop properly; she can act immaturely, he doesn't have to

Bob keeps circling between 'thinking about contacting her and closing the loop for good', and 'not doing anything because silence said enough'. It is consuming a ton of his mental energy, and he wants to get this over with.

He engages in his hobbies, spends time with friends, talks to other girls, etc., yet time and again this unclosed loop surfaces. I think that contacting her most likely won't change the outcome, but that break of silence and subsequent interaction (or ghosting thereof) will give him a clear answer, enabling him to move on.

What should he message her, if anything? (acknowledge the awkwardness, ask to end on good terms, suggest talking about it) What do you suggest?",1,1753218269.0,dating,3,1.0,False

Ezra came back three years later. Not because he wanted to. Not even for closure. But because something in his sleep kept tracing the grid of streets he used to walk as a boy.  The curve of Ashfern Avenue, the rusted crosshatch of the Overpass, the hollowed dome of the old planetarium.




The city hadn’t been rebuilt. The faultline had made promises it kept. The ground still swallowed what it could. No one declared it a memorial, but everyone moved as if it were.  They walked slow-footed, reverent, and even confused.



People roamed. Not enough to feel like a population, but too many to call ghosts. They sold coffee from cracked food trucks parked beside broken schools. They played chess on milk crates beneath dangling power lines. Talked about Meridian like it had a personality.



Ezra walked through the downtown and saw a mural still clinging to a building’s skeleton—someone had painted over the old basketball court with vines and birds. He didn’t recognize the faces anymore. Everyone had the expression of someone waiting for an answer that history refused to give.



What unsettled him most wasn’t the absence of buildings or structure, it was the presence of routine. The way tragedy had become part of the architecture.



No one asked what he was doing there. That felt stranger than anything else.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal Christmas table runner should combine aesthetic appeal with practicality and durability. Here's a look at some of the key features to consider when selecting a runner for your holiday table.

**Material Quality:** The material of a Christmas runner significantly impacts its appearance,durability,and ease of care. Options include cotton, linen, polyester, burlap, velvet, and blends of these. Cotton and linen offer a classic, natural look and feel, while polyester is more durable and wrinkle-resistant. Velvet adds a touch of luxury and elegance, perfect for formal settings. Burlap creates a rustic,cozy vibe. When choosing,consider the overall style you're aiming for and how easy the material is to clean and maintain.**Design and Pattern:** The design and pattern of a Christmas runner are vital for setting the desired holiday mood. Common designs include traditional Christmas motifs like snowflakes, reindeer, Santa Claus, and Christmas trees. Other popular patterns involve festive colors such as red, green, gold, and silver, frequently enough combined in stripes, plaids, or intricate embroidered designs. For a more modern look, consider geometric patterns, abstract designs, or minimalist styles. The best choice will depend on your personal taste and the existing decor of your dining room or kitchen.

**size and Dimensions:** Getting the right size is crucial for the aesthetic and functional purposes of your Christmas runner. Measure your table accurately before making a purchase. A runner should typically overhang the table by at least 6 to 12 inches on each end to create a balanced look. For example, a 72-inch table might pair well with an 84-inch or 90-inch runner.Consider the width of the runner as well; narrower runners (12-14 inches) are ideal for smaller tables or as accents over tablecloths, while wider runners (16-18 inches) make a bolder statement on larger surfaces.

**Durability and Maintenance:** A good Christmas runner should be durable enough to withstand spills, stains, and repeated use throughout the holiday season. look for runners that are well-stitched, colorfast, and resistant to fraying. Also, consider the ease of cleaning and maintenance. Machine-washable fabrics like cotton, linen, or polyester are generally the most convenient. For more delicate materials like velvet or embroidered designs, spot cleaning or professional cleaning might potentially be necessary. Check the care instructions before purchasing to ensure the runner fits your lifestyle.

**Construction and Detailing:** The quality of the construction and small details can elevate a Christmas runner from simple to stylish. Look for features like reinforced edges to prevent fraying, neat and even stitching, and well-executed embroidery or embellishments. some runners may include added details like tassels, pom-poms, or sequins for extra flair. These details not onyl enhance the visual appeal but also indicate a higher level of craftsmanship and attention to detail.

**Colorfastness:** Colorfastness is an crucial factor to consider, especially if you plan to wash the runner frequently.A runner with good colorfastness will maintain its vibrant colors even after multiple washes,preventing fading or bleeding onto other fabrics. Check product reviews or descriptions for data about colorfastness and wash the runner separately the frist time to avoid any potential color transfer.

## FAQS Section

Navigating the world of Christmas table runners can bring up a few questions.Here are some common queries, answered directly to help you make an informed choice.

**What is the best material for a Christmas table runner that needs to be stain-resistant?**
Polyester and polyester blends are excellent choices for stain resistance. These materials are less absorbent than natural fibers like cotton or linen, making them easier to clean and less prone to permanent stains. look for runners labeled as stain-resistant or treated with a stain-repellent finish for added protection.**How do I choose the right length for my Christmas table runner?**
Measure your table length and add 12-24 inches to allow for an overhang of 6-12 inches on each end. This overhang creates a balanced and visually appealing look. If you prefer a shorter overhang or want the runner to simply cover the tabletop without any drop, adjust the length accordingly, leaving at least a few inches on each side.

**Can I use a Christmas table runner on other surfaces besides the dining table?**
Yes, Christmas table runners are versatile and can be used on various surfaces such as coffee tables, sideboards, fireplace mantels, and even dressers. Consider the size and shape of the surface and choose a runner that complements it without overwhelming the space. You can also get creative and use a runner as a wall hanging or festive accent.

**How do I properly care for my Christmas table runner to ensure it lasts for many seasons?**
Always follow the care instructions provided by the manufacturer. Generally, machine-washable runners like cotton or polyester blends can be laundered in cold water on a gentle cycle and tumble-dried on low. For delicate fabrics like velvet or embroidered designs, spot cleaning or professional cleaning may be necessary. Store your runner in a clean,dry place,away from direct sunlight,to prevent fading or damage.

Hey B,

I still think about you. Not in some dramatic or obsessive way—just as a quiet current under everything. Like something in me still reaches for you, instinctively. Even after five months of silence, you’re the one who drifts into my mind when things slow down. The thoughts aren’t painful—they’re steadying. Sometimes I just feel grateful knowing you’re out there, living and breathing in the world.

Not sure if you’ve ever felt that—just being comforted knowing someone you once loved still exists.

A friend asked me recently what I thought about first after two big wins in my life. I said neither. I thought of you. Not because I’m stuck in the past—but because, in some quiet way, you still walk with me. That’s all it means.

We both know full-time romance didn’t work. Too much emotion, too much ego. But also—too much depth to pretend it meant nothing. Let’s be honest—we had something rare. There was a rhythm, a language, a *spirit* in it. Most people never get that. That’s why I floated something simpler, back then. Not because I didn’t love you. Because I did. It was a Hail Mary to protect something we couldn’t seem to hold.

Five months without your voice has been long. And maybe we’ll go years more without speaking. Maybe forever. You probably see me as the ex who hurt you or held you back. And I’ve seen you through that lens too. But more than anything, I remember the way we *saw* each other—clearly, passionately. And I know you’re not just someone I lost. You’re someone who lives in me.

It’s like I carry two conversations inside—my daily thoughts, and a quiet, running dialogue with you.  
“Hey B, I made my weight goal.”  
“Hey B, I heard that song we danced to in the bedroom.”  
“Hey B, I walked past a bakery the other day that smelled like those cinnamon rolls we ate in bed.”  
It’s not sad. It’s not obsessive. It’s just part of me now. And it doesn’t weigh me down—it actually steadies me. It reminds me how deeply I can love.

Maybe you’ve moved on. Maybe there’s someone steady in your life. If so, I’m glad for you. You’re strong. Always have been. I know your story—how early you had to grow up. Mine’s not that different. We both had a long line of people who knocked us down. And then we found each other. And yeah—we turned that fire on each other too. But even that taught me something: that love like ours doesn’t just disappear. It changes form.

Life’s good now. Business is strong, my assistant is back and killing it, and I’ve even gone back to church. I’m healthier, lighter, and more grounded than I’ve been in a long time. You’d recognize me—but you’d also see something more settled in me now. Maybe it’s the weight loss. Maybe it’s the clarity that came with space. Maybe it’s that “poet-warrior” thing you once said I was. Either way, I like who I’m becoming.

And yes, I still carry that “two cottages” dream. You know the one. It’s the only future vision that ever felt simple, honest, and right. And yeah, in that dream, you’re nearby. It’s quiet, kind, and warm. And it still means something.

I’ve also been thinking seriously about moving to your town. Not because of you—but because it feels right. I’m working there more, spending more time there, and I could buy a place for cash outright. There’s a calm charm there that I haven’t found anywhere else. You know what I’ve had to clear out of my life. So yeah, I may be a neighbor by next spring. That’s just the truth and I wanted you to know so it's not a shock.

As for you—so many quiet questions.

How's the new gig?   
How’s my favorite little buddy?  
Are you creating anything new?  
Are you happy? Are you healthy?  
Are you being seen and understood?

If we never talk again, I’ll still be here, quietly rooting for you. For your peace. For your purpose. For your joy. But if a time ever comes when you want to reconnect—coffee, a walk, a laugh—I’m here. No pressure. No expectations. Just two people, honoring something rare that once lived between them. And maybe still does.

You once told me I was the most important relationship of your life. I believed you. I still do.

And you—you’ll always be the golden one.  
Even in silence, I see you. I always did.

My door’s open. Always has been.  
And if nothing else, just know- somewhere out there, there’s a man who knows your soul—and still roots for you, every single day.

1m6pxl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1m6pxl4/anyone_get_benefits_from_quitting_if_caffeine/,"Anyone get benefits from quitting, if caffeine isn't causing any noticeable issues?","Background, I naturally revert to one cup of coffee in the morning (20g) most days, and sometimes another if:

1. I'm working at a coffee shop (a couple times a month)
2. I just feel like the taste and boost in the afternoon (maybe once a month)
3. I'm at a party and feel like a boost, but I usually use alcohol for that.
4. I'm driving a lot and it looks tempting in the gas station store.

When I quit alcohol, I drink a lot of caffeinated soda and sometimes energy drinks. This tends to naturally go down over time as the sugar cravings lessen. I quit 99.5% of my alcohol 2.5 months ago and now most days I'll have one cup of coffee and 2 or 3 sodas. I recently went to low caffeine soda (32 mg).

Even drinking one cup a day in the mornings, I can easily have an energy drink in the evening, fall asleep quickly and sleep 8 hours. Probably even better sleep since cutting alcohol. The effects of caffeine for me are subtle enough, or I'm just not in tune with my feelings enough, that I only drink the evening caffeine when I consciously think about how it probably helps give me energy even though I don't notice it.

I tend to wake up feeling groggy, but I think that has more to do with timing and light. I use an alarm for 8 hours (I don't like to be under rested but also don't like to waste the day sleeping), so most of the time it doesn't happen to be in a period of lighter sleep. The grogginess tends to go away after 20 minutes, usually before I have coffee. I try and get sunlight in my eyes for a bit to help wake up. Sometimes I wake up feeling refreshed and alert but that's almost always if it's natural light or no alarm.

So why would I want to quit?

I drank alcohol to self medicate social situations. Without alcohol, I often just sit off to the side afraid to talk to anyone. I'm thinking if I quit caffeine, maybe it will actually hit and be noticeable when I drink it for a party.

But I'm subtly hoping, although not optimistic, that there will be other noticeable benefits.

EDIT after scrolling a few posts here:  
 \- I don't get anxiety. I don't get it with substance, without substance, on a bad day, a good day, it's just not a feeling I understand. So many people talk about ""their anxiety"" and I never understood what it means. Two years ago I got a panic attack, which was kinda nice because now I finally understand what having anxiety means, but that was a one and only time for me.  
 \- I sleep straight through the night almost every night. I wake up to pee when I drink alcohol, and sometimes recently due to drinking large quantities of non-alcoholic drinks near bedtime, but never anything caffeine related.  
 \- I don't get headaches. For the first 30 years of my life or so, I didn't know what a headache was. I've had 2 or 3 over the years so now I know what they feel like but like anxiety it's not my thing.  
 \- My bowels and poop are fine. Great actually starting a few weeks after cutting the booze.  
 \- I'm 40M  
 \- I'm 99.9% sure I could get an ASD diagnosis if I felt like it. INTP. Maybe ADHD but that may just be alcoholism, ASD, and INTP manifesting as ADHD symptoms sometimes. I tried Adderall once and felt BAD. Much harder time focusing, felt like I drank WAY too much coffee.",2,1753217812.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

1m6pva7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1m6pva7/caught_bil_in_a_lie_not_sure_how_big/,Caught BIL in a lie- not sure how big,"This happened last Thursday, and I'm not sure if this was just my brother in law being an idiot or something more serious- would really appreciate any insight/advice. 

I'm working and have a lunch meeting with a client at an upscale restaurant. We eat, talk, whatever- all as usual. On my way out, I see my brother in law, let's call him B, at the bar having a drink with a young woman. It's surprising, because my commute is an hour south of my home, and B lives another 90 minutes north of me, so he was well out of his way. But I go say hello, and he's startled to see me so much that he's noticeably agitated and his voice is shaking. But he recovers and introduces me to ""K"" and they used to go to school together and were just catching up. Fine.

Friday night, me and my wife, and B and his wife, call her S, are having dinner with my wife and S's parents. All is normal, we're talking, laughing, carrying on. I know that B is a big foodie, so I ask him if the restaurant that I saw him at is one of the ones on his go-to list. And he says, Oh I've heard good things, but I've never been myself, and as he says it he's staring me down, so I'm catching his nonverbal cue to shut the fuck up. 

After dinner, I take him aside and call him out- what the hell was that? Is there something going on between you and K- like what was that all about? And he's cool as a cucumber and tells me that he just doesn't want to get into it with S. He's been out of work and found a lead through his friend K, but he ended up paying for that meal, it was expensive, and he doesn't want to get into another argument about money and overspending with S. 

Thing is, this is perfectly reasonable and makes complete sense. He's been out of work since the top of the year. Every time we see him and S, they are arguing- usually about money habits or him not really putting in effort to find a new gig. I work in finance, and I've been helping them with their budgeting, and I know firsthand from reviewing their spending habits with them that his vice is going to these fancy restaurants. Just don't tell S, you know how crazy she gets about this stuff blah blah blah... I didn't push back to his excuse and said something like- well next time maybe catch up for coffee near your house and don't drive 3 hours to put up a $150 bar bill. 

I'm just not sure if I should trust my gut here that something more was going on and bring it up to my sister in law. His reaction to seeing me, him staring me down across the dinner table, even his very tidy excuse felt almost rehearsed. My wife, who's never been a fan of his, thinks that he's just a lazy shit who's taking advantage of S's kindheartedness and giving nature, but that at the end of the day he's a good dad and she loves him and he would never cheat. 

I keep flip flopping. They're already having issues, always fighting, can't imagine it's healthy for their young son, so I don't want to bring this up if it's truly him just not being good with his money. BUT I also  don't want to be in a situation in 6 months if S finds out B was cheating, and then I get to say - oh yeah I saw him with woman at a restaurant that one time, but I never brought it up. 

Sorry for the short essay- it's just been weighing on my mind. Thanks for any guidance. ",29,1753217662.0,WhatShouldIDo,32,0.91,False

1m6pufy,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1m6pufy/does_youcox_cord_organizer_for_kitchen_appliances/,Does YOUCOX Cord Organizer for Kitchen Appliances Solve Clutter Issues? Detailed Review,"The YOUCOX B0BCX3KPYM Cord Organizer for Kitchen Appliances came as a surprising delight in my daily efforts to maintain an uncluttered home. As someone who constantly wrestles with a counter full of messy appliance cords—in particular, my air fryer, coffee maker, and blender—this little gadget has genuinely improved my organizational game. That said, it’s worth diving into what makes it a hit and where it occasionally misses the mark.

**Sleek and Compact Design**  
The butterfly shape of this cord organizer is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Its compact size of 4.05 x 1.18 inches makes it perfect for fitting seamlessly onto the backs of various kitchen appliances. I appreciated the fact that the material is flexible silicone, making it not only durable but also safe to use. Attaching it to my toaster and air fryer gave them an unexpectedly chic and modern look.

**Ease of Use**  
One of the standout features has to be the strong adhesive backing. Applying it was straightforward—just peel and press onto a clean surface. I did test it on multiple surfaces, including metal, plastic, and even tiles, and it stuck securely each time without leaving any residue when I repositioned it. Even when my toddler decided to “help” by tugging on a few cords, the adhesion held firm, which speaks volumes about its quality.

**Advantages**  
- The flexible silicone material makes it durable and resistant to deformation.  
- It has remarkable compatibility with surfaces like glass, ceramic, wood, plastic, and even wallpaper.  
- Its stylish shape adds aesthetic value to its practicality, blending well with modern kitchen decor.

[Grab YOUCOX B0BCX3KPYM at the best price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0bcx3kpym/)

**Material and Build Quality**  
Constructed from food-grade TPR silicone, this cord organizer stood out because it’s BPA-free and non-toxic. This detail matters a lot, especially in homes with kids or sensitive individuals. I found the silicone to be soft yet robust, a balance that ensures it won’t crack or degrade quickly over time. I’ve had mine for a few weeks now, and they look just as good as the day I stuck them on.

**Performance in Daily Use**  
What really impressed me was how effortlessly this organizer kept cords in place. My blender’s cord, which always seemed to have a mind of its own, is finally tamed. The unique butterfly shape is thoughtfully designed, wrapping around appliance wires without any slippage. I did notice that it works best with cords that aren’t excessively long or thick, like the ones on my coffee maker and toaster.

**Downsides**  
- The adhesive might lose some of its stickiness if exposed to excess moisture or grease for prolonged periods.  
- While compatible with most kitchen appliances, very large or exceptionally heavy-duty cords might not fit as snugly.  
- Removing and repositioning it frequently can reduce its overall lifespan.

**Competing Brands**  
When compared to similar products, such as the D-Line Cable Management Clips and Command Cord Bundlers, the YOUCOX cord organizer holds its own admirably. The silicone material feels superior to the plasticky texture of similar organizers, offering a more premium look and feel. While others boast removable sticky pads, their adhesives often lose strength after the first use. YOUCOX’s 3M glue, by contrast, stuck through multiple tests. However, one point to note is that D-Line clips fit slightly bulkier power cords better.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Considering its thoughtful design, reliable adhesive quality, and the overall improvement to my workspace, this cord organizer seems reasonably priced. It not only gets the job done but also does so with style. Of course, it’s essential to compare prices since many alternatives are out there, but I haven’t found many that bring this level of durability and utility.

Exactly one year ago, I hit “Create Account” on Twitter for something I wasn't even sure I’d finish.  
I called it [**Zuzia.app**](http://Zuzia.app) — named after my daughter.

Not because it sounded startup-y.  
But because she was the reason I started building it in the first place.

I’ve been a sysadmin and backend dev for 20+ years. I’ve dealt with everything: broken crons, flaky scripts, missing alerts, and 4AM ""why is the server down?"" calls.  
When my daughter Zuzia was little, she used to sit next to me while I worked. She’d ask what I was doing. She’d try to “help.” She’d just… be there. And I loved that.

But work was always calling.  
Fix this. Patch that. Monitor this.  
Even when I automated some tasks, it felt like the tools were fighting me, not helping me.

So one day, I opened a blank project and thought:  
**“What if I could build something that actually helps me buy back time — so I can spend more of it with her?”**

That idea became Zuzia.app.

No VC money. No co-founders. No 10-person team.  
Just me, a quiet desk, some coffee, and way too many bash scripts.

# Fast forward 12 months:

* **Thousands of uptime checks run every day**
* **Global agents** that can test services from multiple regions
* **Smart scheduling & automation** to handle tasks (not just monitor them)
* **AI-based analysis** for weird behavior and logs
* A **simple, clean interface** that doesn’t feel like 2009 Nagios hell
* Users that say: “I finally stopped worrying if my service is up. It just tells me.”

And I’m still building. Every week. Sometimes fast, sometimes slow — but always moving.

It started as something just for me.  
Now people like me — indie devs, sysadmins, DevOps folks, bootstrapped founders — are actually using it and sending feedback like:

>

# Why am I sharing this?

Because not everything has to be a rocketship.  
You don’t need $2M in seed funding to solve a real problem.  
You can build slowly. Honestly. With purpose.

If you're like me — tired of noisy tools, glued-together bash scripts, or waking up at 3AM to restart something that *should* have been checked — check out [https://zuzia.app](https://zuzia.app). There's even a free plan.

And if you're building something for *your* reasons, don’t give up.  
Not every project has to be a unicorn. Sometimes it just needs to be useful — and real.

I used to think I wanted to be an influencer but truthfully, my life seems a lot more exciting and peaceful compared to what they share. I know social media is a highlight reel but maybe we need to stop calling some of these women influencers and call them “content creators” because that’s what they are. There is no influence….

They don’t give off Danielle Bernstein or New York Influencer vibes. Granted we have a select few that I love to follow like AGirlAboutChicago and JackieCamardo - who I feel like are actually influencers across food and travel. And Marissa and Aubre have their own businesses and create content to showcase that, so I feel like that’s actually inspiring and building community through movement.

My girlfriend lives up in Evanston so I’ll probably be heading up that way a few times a week too, if that makes any difference. Both places have garages, one is a two-car and the other’s just a one-car, which isn’t a huge deal either way but figured I’d mention it.

It's not that I don't like going out, just that I only do when my friends tell me they feel social enough to go somewhere or just hang out. 

I've been hanging out with my best friend here and there and she got the idea to grab some coffee with another mutual friend of ours. We used to be a friend group of 3 but kind of split up and now rarely meet up. I organized the time and place and we all agreed. However, when the time came I was getting driven by my mother who also needed to get some stuff done in the city. She's usually very kind and understanding and agreed to get me to the meetup place, but when it was time to leave she kept delaying it. I was already 20 minutes late and apologized to my friends. I tagged along with her because she said it would be quick and I didn't want to leave her alone, always nicer to have someone with you. She had to go to the post office but didn't check the time they opened even after I told her that specific post office has weird open hours. Surprise, surprise - it was closed. She then got pretty angry at that and we went to another post office just to find out they were on break for another 20 minutes. This got her, understandably so, pretty furious since she was short on time. At this point I was already 50 minutes late to the meetup so I just decided to wait with her and go home right after since she was pretty mad and wanted to go home. I didn't want to bother her any more. 

I feel horrible that I wasn't there with my friends. Us hanging out is basically a once in a year event and me not being there hurts. I love them and love hanging out with them so missing out on this opportunity sucks. I haven't had many friends throughout my entire life and I've known my best friend for basically 10 years at this point. It's all worse because I have a constant fear of abandonment, that I could easily be replaced because, honestly, I don't contribute much. Usually when we're hanging out I just sit there and listen to them talk, not saying much. I adore listening, but talking feels like a chore unless it's a very active conversation. 

I know we can just hang out again sometime in the future, but waiting until that time and thinking about the moment I wasn't there with them is going to be even more painful. It always feels like I miss something important and making new friends feels wrong to me. Firstly because I'm very picky with the people I keep close and not a lot of people see me as a potential friend since I'm so quiet and secondly because it sort of feels like I'd be abandoning the relationships I currently have.

Hi everyone,
I’m 28 and have been living in London, Ontario for about three years. I love coffee and used to work as a barista, though it’s been a while.

I’ve been researching roasters, types of milk, and brainstorming specialty drinks.( I have also been going around my local cafes and trying what they offer and all are delicous!!). I’ve been trying different beans/roasters, drinks, chai's, and matchas to find what the community might enjoy.
I also plan on adding bakery goods and food later on hopefully 

I’m aware I need permits and to meet health codes, and I’m already in contact with local authorities about requirements.

That said, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed and would love advice from anyone who has experience with opening a coffee cart or small food business in London or Ontario. Any tips on what to focus on first, pitfalls to avoid, or how to connect with the local coffee community would be really appreciated.

Then a bath.   
Maybe salmon for dinner.

Bright, glimmering, green, 
Leaves from my winter dreams.   
Too soon they will fall;

To make this short, I had a few trial days at a new job, and the boss was all over the place even though I needed many clarifications and guiding (entry level position). I wasn't even sure if I was getting paid... because she said she'd give me official papers for temporary employment and pay me. Then on the first day she didn't bring those papers and I genuinely thought that meant she won't pay me. I wasn't told when to take a break, would've needed tiny adjustments in the work environment (I was freezing from the AC, her rescue cats were fighting each other all the time around my legs) and schedule. 

Nothing was clarified. The main fricking problem was that she just didn't talk to me or make things clear at all. Most things she told me, she did only did once. It was my first time working in accounting like wtf. She knew that. Why wouldn't she supervise or just check in on me periodically. I told her that on the interview.

She let me know someone was there on the previous week for trial days so that was also stressful knowing I was competing with someone (I assumed that meant she will choose between us). I just..... couldn't muster up the courage to communicate with her and let her know my frustrations about things not being clear or needing to be told things more than once.

And my frustration grew to such extent that I just stood up, told her I'm sorry but I don't think this is a good match for me, she payed me, and I left.

My family told me they don't blame me at all based on the working conditions alone (I literally watched one of the cats drink her coffee after she put it down and went out for something, plus I was sitting in cat poop smell since she didn't have time to clean the kitty toilet), and the boss leaving me alone to work on important things, not checking out my work, not being there to answer (she kept leaving all the fucking time). 

The last straw was me noticing an error in what I was doing that no one had told me to watch out for and I lost all interest in continuing since I would be doing it wrong but I was alone for an hour at that point. There was no good reason for my work and I didn't learn anything except a couple of very basic things... The whole reason they wanted to hire me was to teach me, but I was doing the same thing for 8,5 hours each day. 

I don't know if it's my fault for not speaking up or hers for not clarifying shit. It's just exhausting because I didn't see any quality saving this job other than the fact that it's *a job* and looks good on paper but I don't learn shit and I had no idea if I'm working for free atm.

Hi! I'm trying to remember the title of a fiction novel I read years ago.

The story takes place in urban San Francisco. The main character is a woman whose husband either died or left her. She ends up homeless and starts sleeping in her car outside her former home, which is now owned by the government due to some legal or tax issue. The house overlooks water—possibly the bay.

A police officer notices her, offers her coffee, and begins helping her. He becomes an important character in the story and has his own personal backstory. Eventually, the two start an affair.

The woman also tries to get legal help to reclaim her home but has no money to pay a lawyer.

I believe it was a contemporary novel, not historical, and likely published in the 2000s or 2010s. I don’t recall the title or author, but the setting and emotional tone were very vivid.

The idea is to keep this as a small, minimalist side hustle I can run while traveling full-time. I’ll mostly be staying in hostels and working from my laptop. I want to sell small handmade leather goods either in-person (just casually sitting near the entrance of a hostel or a coffee shop with a small setup and a sign), or through Etsy with a limited, always-in-stock product line.

So far, I’m using only 4 oz veg-tan leather in black and natural. I’ll offer two thread colors: black and brown. I’m going for a clean, natural finish. Just simple, burnished, high-quality cuts that feel good in the hand.

For tools, I’m trying to stay as compact and TSA-compliant as possible since I don’t check bags. That means no awl, no rivet setters, and no heavy presses. I’m working with a 2-prong and 4-prong 4mm stitching chisel, needles and waxed thread, a compact contact cement bottle, a beveler, burnisher, and a pair of snap pliers for hardware. If I need anything I can’t fly with, I’ll have to source it locally when I land. Simplicity is key.

The product line is intentionally tight and tailored for travelers. I’m currently planning to offer six items: a minimalist card wallet ($35), a passport cover ($45), a stitched leather key fob ($15), a snap-closure cable organizer ($8), a corner bookmark ($8), and a plain leather bracelet with a snap ($15). The smaller $8 items are also available in a mix-and-match bundle: any three for $20. All hardware is antique brass finish to keep the visual branding clean and cohesive. The key fob uses a single piece of leather folded and stitched with a brass key ring. The cable organizer and bracelet both use snaps, no stitching. The wallet and passport cover are stitched and take more time, hence the higher prices.

Eventually, I’ll post on Etsy with just a small stock of each item. Nothing overwhelming. But right now, my only goal is to get good at the craft and make this setup work while living light and moving often.

What I’d love to hear from you all is: Does this sound viable? Are there any product changes, tool suggestions, or travel-specific considerations I should think about? Also, how realistic is it to rely on just just these tools for travel-ready leatherworking? And if you were a fellow traveler, would you actually buy these products?

My first class flight to St Louis from Missouri, the service was fantastic. But the second leg returning home was not.","I was in St. Louis due to my dad being in hospice and after his passing, I was flying STL to TUS, layover in DFW Saturday 7/19. The flight was supposed to leave at 7:30pm, there were weather delays with the incoming flight from Chicago and the flight didn't leave until 9:00pm, not a huge deal, my layover time went from over 2 hrs to 25 minutes. Not too stressed about it though. 
First flight was good, they gave us snacks and the FA. Christine was very very nice. We chatted for a minute and I told her why I was flying home and she was very sweet. She made sure I had enough to drink and plenty of snacks, and checked on me often. She was absolutely fantastic for the gentleman in front of me who had been significant whether delay is awesome and did not have time to get anything to eat so she made sure he had lots of the snacks. However the second flight was not good at all. And maybe I shouldn't be complaining and maybe this is just nitpicking, but I paid a lot of extra money to be in first class, and I felt like I was completely ignored. The FA barely acknowledged that there was even anyone in first class. Came by and asked me what I wanted to drink and I said a coffee she came by and brought the coffee and one bag of mixed nuts. And because of the delays I was completely parched and I would have liked some water but I did not see her again to ask for water until about 45 minutes later, and then she walked through the cabin with the water bottle on her hand but didn't offer me anymore, I had to stop her later and ask for more water. The flight was only 2 hours long but it felt like forever. It was just super frustrating that I had first class tickets and I felt like they didn't even want to be bothered with getting us something to drink.

Review inside!,"The Smeg EGF03 Semi-Automatic Espresso Machine caught my eye with its retro-inspired design and promises of barista-grade coffee. Testing this machine has been an adventure in espresso brewing, offering both surprises and lessons along the way. While charming in appearance and featuring some promising features, this machine left me with mixed emotions about its functionality and usability.

**Design and Build Quality**

This pastel green appliance has that undeniable Smeg aesthetic. On my kitchen counter, it drew immediate compliments from anyone who walked in. The durable stainless steel and thoughtful retro design elements make it clear that this product prioritizes style. However, at 28 pounds, moving it from one spot to another felt more like carrying a small child. The machine's 14""x14""x18"" dimensions mean it requires a fair bit of counter space, so if your kitchen is tight, you’ll need to plan accordingly.

**Ease of Use**

Using it is straightforward for a semi-automatic machine. I found the button controls intuitive, with separate options for single and double espressos. Even as a semi-experienced coffee enthusiast, tweaking grind sizes and brew settings turned into a bit of trial and error. Luckily, the included accessories, such as the tamper and the cleaning kit, help streamline the process of experimentation. On the downside, those acoustic signals—it beeps loudly and often—quickly became an irritation during early morning shifts in my kitchen.

**Strengths**

- Retro design that adds charm to any kitchen counter.  
- The dual Thermoblock system ensures rapid steaming and brewing.  
- Passively warms cups, which feels like a luxury touch.  

**Performance and Flavor**

Let me just say, getting that perfect crema felt immensely satisfying. I could use the machine to brew espresso, mocha, lattes, and cappuccinos. The grinder’s range from coarse to superfine settings ensures you can adjust the brew’s strength and flavor. My aunt, who swears by her morning lattes, found the milk frother perfectly capable of creating rich foam. On the downside, not all settings felt polished—one day, my espresso would come out flawless, the next it felt over-extracted despite following the exact same routine.

**Favorable Attributes**

- User-friendly buttons with clear icons for grinding and brewing.  
- Auto shut-off feature for added energy efficiency.  
- Comes with multiple filters to accommodate different coffee types.  

**Areas of Concern**

- Grinding consistency could be hit or miss, which affects flavor.  
- The machine stopped giving notifications once, leaving me puzzled mid-brew.  
- Heavy and relatively bulky—this isn’t for everyone’s kitchen setup.  

**Other Options**

In the competitive market of espresso machines, brands like Breville and De’Longhi inevitably come to mind. Having used the Breville Barista Express, I can say it offers similar semi-automated functionality but comes with slightly better grinder reliability. De’Longhi excels in steamer power, perfect for cappuccino or latte lovers. However, for pure countertop aesthetic appeal, few brands can touch what Smeg offers.

**Cost-Efficiency**

This machine finds itself in the premium price range, and that might not sit well for users just dipping their toes into the espresso-making world. For someone who values intuitive design above all else, it may strike the perfect chord. For others, the balance between price and performance might feel slightly skewed, especially if you’re after perfect espressos every single time.

1m6p5um,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harrisburg/comments/1m6p5um/what_are_the_problemsissues_that_are_preventing/,What are the problems/issues that are preventing Harrisburg from being the bustling city it has the potential to be?,"So I recently visited Lancaster with some friends for a board game convention. While walking from where we parked to the convention venue (probably a 10-minute walk), and this is around 6-10 pm, I saw so much activity, commerce, and life. If you want some semblance of NYC in PA, move to Lancaster. So much appeared to be going on, everyone was outside, shops saw a lot of traffic (from what I could tell), and all of this on a Thursday evening.

  
After being in Lancaster recently, and I've been there a few times in the last ten years, being a Harrisburg resident, I wondered if I should have moved there in recent months. The grass is always greener on the other side, mind you, but I couldn't help but wonder if I would find myself enjoying life more in Lancaster than in Harrisburg. I value Harrisburg, I really do; I love the community, the riverfront location, the coffee shops and restaurants, and the festivals. I still have yet to explore more, however, like HACC, Harrisburg Comic Con, City Island, and more. But I have heard criticisms of the city a considerable number of times, enough to question what exactly keeps us from experiencing the cultural and economic boom that cities like Lancaster are experiencing.

  
We (and I'm a relatively new resident so I don't claim to have shared in all the hardships of long-time residents) are frequently losing restaurants and shops, crime is reported to be a constant big issue, the city government is said to be ineffective at leading and managing the city, parking is a huge pain (believe me, as a new resident I've felt violated by how insane parking is here), and tax dollars are directed to all the things the city doesn't desperately need.

  
Would you all agree? What are some issues you feel the City is facing that prevents us from experiencing a renaissance? Why are places like Lancaster growing and attracting so much life, as compared to us? Do you disagree with how I'm seeing this?",23,1753216016.0,Harrisburg,23,0.97,False

Is there any location in the convention center that will be quiet/quiet-ish (background noise like a coffee shop is fine, but nothing like loud music/dialog) that I could reasonably take a meeting? Any places people know that are close by that I take the calls? Wifi is not a problem since I can hotspot myself as long as there is decent cell reception.

Last year, I found myself struggling since I had the same situation and the Voodoo ranger music was too loud to take any spot near the waterfront and the front of con center was also too loud.

When you forgo your morning coffee you feel terrible. You think that this is due to an absence of the coffee as opposed to being caused by the coffee. 

When you drank your first cup of coffee you got a jolt (not true energy but an anxious feeling that social brainwashing leads you to believe is energy).  Dopamine and other energising chemicals are elevated. Good huh? Well no, because in the long term coffee like all stimulant drugs depletes these feel good chemicals. Furthermore, you develop a caffeine tolerance. By the time you’ve had your 500th coffee all that’s happening is that you’re being returned to baseline. Coffee is no longer making you feel ‘better’ than baseline but it seems like it does because it’s relieving the withdrawal created by the drug and you’ve long forgotten what baseline feels like.

It gets worse. As your tolerance develops further, you don’t even return to baseline but somewhere below. This means that even though you (in the short term) feel better than you did before you drank the coffee, you FEEL WORSE THAN SOMEONE WHO’S NEVER DRUNK COFFEE. And down you go, becoming ever more exhausted by consuming this drug that is supposed to energise you. 


Caffeine doesn’t energise you. This is all an illusion. Children who’ve never consumed caffeine have energy. Adult caffeine addicts are exhausted, stressed out, dehydrated wrecks with bags under their eyes.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern 36 square table comes equipped with a range of features, impacting its durability, aesthetics, and overall functionality.

**Solid wood Construction**

Solid wood construction is a hallmark of many high-quality 36 square tables. Tables made from hardwoods like oak, maple, or walnut offer superior strength and longevity compared to those constructed from particleboard or MDF. The natural grain patterns and warm tones of solid wood add a touch of elegance to any space. Solid wood tables are also more resistant to scratches and dents, ensuring they maintain their appearance over time.

**Adjustable Height mechanism**

Some 36 square tables feature an adjustable height mechanism, allowing them to transform between dining tables, coffee tables, or even standing desks. This versatility makes them ideal for small spaces where furniture must serve multiple purposes. Adjustable height tables typically use a hydraulic lift or a manually operated system to adjust the table's height within a specified range. The mechanism should be sturdy and reliable, ensuring the table remains stable at any height.**Foldable Design**

Foldable 36 square tables are designed for maximum space-saving convenience. These tables can be easily folded and stored when not in use, making them perfect for apartments, dorm rooms, or other areas with limited space. The folding mechanism must be easy to operate and lock securely in both the open and closed positions. The table should also maintain its stability and structural integrity when folded and stored.

**Scratch-Resistant finish**

A scratch-resistant finish is essential for any 36 square table, especially those used in high-traffic areas or by families with young children. Tables with a durable laminate or powder-coated finish are better equipped to withstand scratches, spills, and other everyday wear and tear. A scratch-resistant finish not only protects the table's surface but also makes it easier to clean and maintain.

“Shove a beached me’thr’k up your tail!” I yelled out as the shuttle I was piloting in the simulation clunked against one of the others parked at the station.

“I’ll reset things so you can try again,” Auggie said calmly while taking a sip from his coffee and leaning over to press the blinking yellow button on his instructor’s station. “Practice makes perfect, Haasha.”

“Why in the stars do I need to learn this? Nobody parks like this anywhere in the galaxy!” I huffed out with irritation.

“It’s on the books as a required skill for all Terran shuttle pilots as there are still older stations that have docking ports set up like this,” Auggie explained while sitting back and relaxing to watch her next attempt. “We can get away with your existing Galactic license for operations in space, but the regs are pretty strict when it comes to stepping up to atmospheric flight with Terran shuttles. You’re required to have the base Terran shuttle certification in order to apply for the atmospheric certification. Sorry, but it’s just the rules. So, you need to learn this.”

*Outside the simulator…*

Chang heard Haasha’s muffled scream of frustration and wandered into the engineering bay to see what was going on. First, he saw the enclosed flight simulator, then he noticed a table loaded with drinks and snacks, and finally a group of about ten chairs sat in front of a holoprojector. Every seat was filled and at least another 4 or 5 crew were standing at the back of the room with drinks while watching and chatting.

It looked like the holoprojector was set up to show the outside observer’s view of the simulation. He watched for a moment as the shuttle in the simulation was approaching a station slowly with other ships docked in front and behind the open docking port. It didn't take a genius to conclude there must be some significant entertainment value to pull in such a gathering with a full spread of snacks. Noticing Lynn sitting in one of the chairs with a bowl of fresh popcorn, he stepped over to check in with her.

“What’s happening? And why did I hear Haasha scream?” he asked with a confused look. 

“Wait for it…” Lynn said with a smile and giddy expectation as she nodded towards the holoprojector. 

The shuttle in the simulation was pulled into position next to the forward docked ship. It then backed up slowly and turned in towards the station in reverse, but the rear of the shuttle clipped the docked ship.

“Shove a loader up your arse!” Haasha bellowed out from inside the simulator, followed by Auggie’s muffled voice a moment later as the simulation reset.

“We have a betting pool going,” Lynn explained. “Bets are on how many attempts it takes for Haasha to learn to parallel park, or how many tries until Auggie buckles under the power of fur and lets her out of this.”

“I thought parallel parking was no longer part of the shuttle flight certification,” Chang responded, getting the distinct feeling he was missing something.

“It hasn’t been part of the actual tests for over 50 years since automated docking arms were mandated on the old stations due to too many accidents, but the requirement is technically still on the books. Kind of like those crazy old laws people forget but are still active. I think it was Nevada that had a law for centuries that you couldn’t ride a camel on a highway, and I’m pretty sure it was Carlisle in the old UK where any Scot could be whipped or jailed if found walking around town. The law was on the books for close to 1000 years until a large bunch of Scots showed up wearing shirts declaring 'Whip me! I like it!' and they finally repealed the law,” she said as she glanced back at the holoprojector to see how close Haasha was on her next attempt.

“But…” he started before Lynn waved a hand to cut him off.

“Remember how Haasha picked up that tea from her homeworld from Streggy and made a batch for us to try?” she asked.

“The one that tasted like mango with a bacterial infection?” he responded quickly with a shiver of disgust.

“Haasha used the coffee maker in the officer’s lounge to make it,” Lynn explained. “It’s never made a good cup of coffee without a nasty aftertaste since that fateful day. Rosa has gone so far as to replace all the tubing and as many of the parts in the machine as possible, but whatever the hell is in that tea, it’s still stuck in the machine and making it produce nasty coffee that no amount of cream or sugar can cover up.”

“Oh, no…” he said, suddenly realizing why a lot of the officers had been especially grumpy over the past few days.

“Susan is fascinated with the science of how it wrecked the machine but not fascinated enough to vote against having Haasha learn to parallel park. She misses being able to make small batches of her specialty roast for herself,” Lynn quickly followed up.

“Right. You said something about bets?” he inquired.

“Jack is handling it,” she responded. “10 credit buy in for the main pool, 3 credits per simulator session on how many times she lets a naughty word escape her pretty pink lips. It’s too late to get in the cussing pool for today, but the main pool is still open.”

“Arrrrrg! Why can’t you shn’iks leave a little more space so a girl can dock?” Haasha screamed out in rage from inside the simulator. Then, in a far more pitiful and pleading tone that probably would have melted Chang’s heart when combined with puppy dog eyes, she asked, “Auggie - do I really have to learn this to get my Terran shuttle certification?”

Chang sighed and looked thoughtful as the simulation quickly reset again. He pulled out a datapad and sent Jack a message with a 10 credit transfer attached. “Not looking good for Haasha.”

“Nope. Popcorn?”

1m6owbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1m6owbd/is_this_something_or_just_being_awkwardness/,Is this something or just being awkwardness?,"So I’ve (F30) had a bit of a thing with a coworker (M30) for a while. We always exchange glances and sometimes he just stares at me for a few moments. We also tease each other and have a playful vibe between us.

We recently went on a work trip together and the banter was definitely there. Lots of teasing and jokes. I definitely felt attraction and on the last day of the trip I invited him to grab a coffee 1:1. The vibe totally shifted - he was really tense and the chat was mainly about work. I felt that I had messed it up and scared him OR that maybe he liked the friendly flirt but did not wish that to escalate it any further (no problem obv). He's usually quiet chill in group settings.

What really puzzled me was that on the way back, we were waiting for our flight and he first sat across from me, but then randomly switched and sat right next to me. After a bit of chit chat, he suddenly said: “I hope I don’t smell bad.” (It was a hot day but he obviously didn't smell bad and it felt like he was maybe hinting that he had switched places to sit close to me)

After some more chit chat, he said: ""I wish I had more guts like \[another coworker we both know\].” It came out of nowhere and felt a bit vulnerable, but I was caught of guard and did not know what to say either, so I did not develop the topic much further.

What am I looking at here? Was he trying to open up or just being crazy awkward?

## key Features Analysis

The following key features are crucial to consider when evaluating 8 oz plastic cups.

**Material Composition**

The type of plastic used significantly impacts the cupS durability, clarity, and recyclability.Common materials include polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polystyrene (PS).  PP cups are known for thier versatility and resistance to cracking, while PET cups offer excellent clarity and are often recyclable.  PS cups,while generally more rigid,may be more brittle and less environmentally friendly. The presence of BPA or other harmful chemicals should also be a primary consideration.

**Wall Thickness**

A thicker wall generally indicates greater durability and resistance to crushing or leaking.Thicker-walled cups are better suited for holding hot liquids or for situations where the cups might potentially be subjected to rough handling. Conversely, thinner-walled cups are more economical but might potentially be more prone to damage.  The weight of the cup, measured in grams per cup, can be an indicator of wall thickness.

**Rim Design**

The rim of the cup plays a crucial role in drinking comfort and leak prevention. A smooth, rolled rim provides a agreeable drinking experience and helps to prevent spills. A sharp or unfinished rim can be uncomfortable and may even pose a safety hazard.  The rim should also be designed to allow for a secure lid fit, if applicable.

**Stackability**

Efficient storage is essential, notably when dealing with large quantities of cups. Cups designed with a slight taper and nesting features allow for compact stacking, saving valuable storage space. Poorly stacked cups can be difficult to separate and may be prone to tipping over. Consider the height of a stack of cups when determining how much storage space you will require.

**Clarity and Aesthetics**

For certain applications, such as displaying colorful beverages or desserts, clarity is a key consideration. Clear cups allow the contents to be easily seen, enhancing the visual appeal.  Opaque or frosted cups might potentially be preferable for situations where discretion is desired. The overall aesthetic design of the cup, including its shape and finish, can also contribute to the overall presentation.

**Heat Resistance**

The ability of the cup to withstand hot liquids is an essential factor for serving coffee, tea, or other hot beverages. Cups designed for hot drinks should be made from heat-resistant materials and should not deform or release harmful chemicals when exposed to high temperatures. Check the manufacturer's specifications for the maximum recommended temperature.

## Core Benefits

8 oz plastic cups offer several distinct advantages over other types of beverage containers.

**Convenience and Portability:** Their lightweight and disposable nature makes 8 oz plastic cups incredibly convenient for on-the-go use.  They eliminate the need for washing and can easily be transported to picnics, parties, or sporting events. This simplifies cleanup and reduces the hassle associated with reusable containers.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** Plastic cups are generally more affordable than glass, ceramic, or metal alternatives.  This makes them a practical choice for large gatherings or for situations where frequent disposal is required. The low cost per cup allows for efficient budgeting, particularly for businesses or organizations that serve a high volume of beverages.

**Hygiene and Sanitation:** Single-use plastic cups promote hygiene by eliminating the risk of cross-contamination associated with shared reusable cups.  They provide a fresh, clean drinking surface for each user, reducing the spread of germs and bacteria. This is particularly important in healthcare settings or food service establishments where sanitation is paramount.

**Versatility:**  Beyond beverages, 8 oz plastic cups can be used for a variety of other purposes, such as portioning snacks, measuring ingredients, or organizing small items. Their compact size and durability make them suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. They are a versatile solution for a wide range of needs, from hosting parties to organizing a workspace.

**Reduced breakage Risk:** Unlike glass cups, plastic cups are much less likely to break if dropped or mishandled.  This reduces the risk of injury and simplifies cleanup. This makes them a safer option for events with children or in environments where breakage is a concern.

Things like being in a mixed gender friend group, having male coworkers and making small talk with them, going out without telling him well in advance, i accidentally broke some of these rules or made mistakes when i didnt know i was making a mistake, or breaking a rule i didnt know existed until i broke it.

We broke up ultimately because over time he began to resent me, and i know functionally this man was abusive. He threatened to kill me, he made jokes about beating me up, he had a bad temper and even threatened to get violent when i asked for reassurance during a convo

But when he wasnt murderously mad, he was so kind, unbelievably loving and the trauma bond is still strong that three months after the break up i STILL FEEL GUILTY
