It is just so weird how any time someone is running around in the flat for example the hallway or the kitchen in just boxers or just short sweat pants (so no t shirt) no one except the north american person has an issue with this. 

We talked about it and they said ""its fine😒"" but is it is really fine then why make weird comments about nudity or make it sexual? Its so annoying to me how this puritan and hypersexual thinking is just projected onto other people...

If you are not comfortable with coming out of the bathroom in just a towel or just a shirt and underwear thats fine but why make it weird or even sexual when other people do it? I never thought anything weird of having less clothing on in my own home and now I have to worry about these weird comments when i have just a towel on when i'm on my way from the bathroom to my room. Or when i just woke up and make a coffee in the kitchen area with a tshirt and boxers on. 

I was told by another roommate that i have to respect the culture and all but i find it hard to respect weird behaviour towards me/the other roomies. My body is not just a sexual object and i am sick of having this hyper sexual puritan way of thinking installed in my brain. i find myself worrying about ""are these boxers too sexual for going to the kitchen to fill up my water bottle?"" 

Does anyone have similar problems with international roomies/roomies from north america? If so, how did you handle it or speak about it without offending/disrespecting the roomie? :/",1,1763057738.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

1ow8fwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1ow8fwc/a_day_of_adulting_with_trauma_disability/,A day of Adulting with trauma disability,"I woke up mid day right before sun started to set. I took three hours or more to finish my coffee and take my daily meds. 

I couldn't handle my partner touching my leg without freezing up and I can't explain why because I don't even know myself and there's no energy available to dive in to my 57 seperate traumas to find possible trigger reason, so I just accept my emotional flashback and told him I need some space to stay a frozen yoghurt. 

I haven't bothered entering the kitchen chaos yet. The thought of witnessing the abandoned chores gives me panic. Our cleaner lady is so rude too and randomly takes out vacations without telling me. (The cleaner lady is me)

So I don't eat, I shut down and stay away on the couch in my little reddit bubble in my panties and I don't bother to start the day. What a life hack right? 

This *might* also got to go with me having a doctor appointment tomorrow.  Doctors are my enemies  (if you ask my treatment resistant severe anxiety disorder.) So I'm just trying to avoid an anxiety paralysis tonight as I usually have it throughout the night before any social..anything. This is digital appointment but my brain don't care: *""You're trespassing my home on my screen! Feel my wrath doctor, feel my wrath!!""*  

So I've buried my brain down in reddit to escape, to breathe, and to build courage to face my shit outside the screen. And it has helped. It has been stimulating, like me-time while others are watching, maybe even appreciating my brain in the open. But I also know *""I'm not being productive""* when I've laid here in my couch and haven't even bothered to put on pants and time's soon 6 pm and my breakfast will also be my lunch, and dinner. It feels very much **not adult.**  

The adult in me is echoing: *""Food is the first best gateway to energy. Go eat!""* but I just roll my internal eyes at myself. It's like my anxiety spreads like virus spores in the air and infects everything and I just try to not get sicker than I already am. 
Fact is ever since I woke up ,this whole day I have shamed myself for not adulting like a full function person *when I'm the opposite of a full functioning adult.* 

I have also rewritten this 5 times because appearantly it wasn't good enough for reddit venting the 4 other times and I considered making it shorter and less messy with Ai but then people complain it's not human so here you go, it's 100% verified messy human wall of text dump post. I'm now gonna eat some food in spite and have anxiety meds with my Capri Sun. Welcome to my Thursday.

I hope someone who is into baking and have a sweet tooth find this interesting.  

Ingredients:

\- All-purpose flour 3-4 cups  
\- Grated unsalted sweet cream butter - 8 Oz two sticks  
\- Baking powder - 2 tsp  
\- Vanilla - 1 tsp  
\- Salt - ¼ tsp  
\- Egg 2  
\- Yogurt -1 cup

Recipe:  
The recipe for the dough is very easy and straightforward.  Toss your flour and salt into a big bowl, then add the butter and rub it in with your fingers (or a pastry cutter) until the mixture looks crumbly. In a smaller bowl, whisk together the egg, yogurt (or half yogurt half sour cream), and baking powder vanilla and salt, then pour that into the flour mix and stir until it comes together into a soft dough. Give it a quick knead—just enough to make it smooth—then cover it up and let it rest for about 30 minutes while you make the filling (or grab a coffee). That’s it! After resting, you can roll it out, spread the khoriz (the sweet flour-butter-sugar filling), and shape your gata.

Coffee in the morning. A quiet room when I can get it. Writing. Small, repeatable things that keep the machine from seizing.  


I try to keep some play inside the grind. I started to post little video clips of my chess bullet games I play online with music I like, and hide a line from my work-in-progress in the caption. It doesn’t fix anything. It just reminds me, that I’m still a live. Reminds me of this note from Hadi Pakzad, who once said “My work was finished, but I still had time. My work was finished and I still had time! This is my home; my work is finished, but I still have time”. And I’m here and still have time while everything is like a drift, you take a different street because the light turned red. You say “yes” because you’re just tired and “no” would probably take more words. You answer a message because your thumb was already there. Later, maybe many years later you realize that was the hinge but you don’t see it until the door is already somewhere else.

I’m not proud of any of this, just telling how it felt to me, when life narrows, and narrows, then narrows again. I can fight the slope, or I can plant my feet and do the next small necessary thing.

For some reason nag ka sabay-sabay lahat ng pwedeng maramdaman negatively, nandun yung pagod, galit, lungkot, longing 🥺

Yung boss ko nag buo ng sarili niyang grupo, sinama niya ko, super saya ko kasi na ai-air out ko lahat ng pwede namin gawin and nakikita naman na talagang nagiging productive kasi tumataas sales namin. Little did I know na meron palang tao na hindi natutuwa na kala niya nag papa bibo ako kaya lahat na lang sinasabutahe niya and alam ko lahat ng ginawa niya pero pinili ko lang na tumahimik na lang and ayusin yung ginawa niya. Pero di ako santo, may limit din talaga. 

So eto na, nag sumbong na ako kay boss dahil etong si ate mo girl biglaan ako inalis dun sa project na ako yung may hawak, ako yung bumuo, ako yung nag aayos like wow, pag pasok ko bigla niya sinabe di ka na belong dito sa project na to — alanganamang matuwa ako shempre galit na galit ako. Walk out talaga ko na parang gusto ko na mag resign pero dahil bread winner ako di ko pwede gawin. 

Instead nag simba ko. At grabe, grabe yung gospel ni Father, parang meant to be na marinig ko yun, parang sinagot niya lahat. And after ng misa napaka gaan na ng pakiramdam ko. Balik opisina, report kay boss na inalis ako ni ate mo girl sa project pero professional way I told my boss na kaya yun ng team ko. Let me know if meron ka pang kailangan na pwede kong magawa — Bhiii on the spot — prinomote ako ni boss, raised my salary and give me everything I need to work on this new project 🙏🏼💕

But honestly winter only feels nice if you have money.

If you’ve got room heaters, geysers in every bathroom, thick blankets, and warm clothes, of course you’ll find it cozy. But if you don’t, winter is just painful. Your skin hurts, your nose keeps running, and even simple stuff like bathing or going to class feels like a whole task.

Most middle and lower-income families don’t have heating systems or well-insulated homes. And I can’t even imagine how poor people survive in this freezing weather. We talk about how hard summers are, but winters are equally tough when you don’t have the luxury to “enjoy” them.

People romanticize winter way too much it’s only magical when you can afford comfort.

1ow8cn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1ow8cn3/is_smart_plugs_worth_it_for_daily_energy_savings/,Is smart plugs worth it for daily energy savings?,"Look, I'll be straight with you. I was skeptical about smart plugs too. Another gadget that promises to save money but ends up collecting dust? Yeah, I've been there.

But here's what changed my mind after actually using them for six months.

**The Real Deal with Energy Savings**

Smart plugs won't make you rich overnight. Let's get that out of the way. But they do add up in ways I didn't expect. The average household wastes around 10% of their electricity bill on phantom power – stuff that's plugged in but not being used. TVs, phone chargers, coffee makers, all quietly draining power 24/7.

I started by plugging my entertainment center into a smart plug. Turned out my TV and Xbox were using power even when ""off."" Now they actually shut down at night. Same thing with my phone chargers and kitchen appliances.

**What Actually Makes Them Useful**

The scheduling feature is honestly the best part. My space heater turns off automatically when I leave for work. No more wondering if I left it on all day. My living room lamps turn on before I get home so I'm not walking into a dark house.

You can control everything from your phone too. Forgot to turn off your curling iron? Done from your car. Want to turn on a fan before you get home? Easy.

**The Numbers Game**

Most smart plugs cost between 15-25 bucks. If you're saving even $5-10 monthly on your electric bill, they pay for themselves in a few months. After that, it's pure savings. Not life-changing money, but enough to notice over a year.

The bigger win is convenience and peace of mind. Not worrying about what's running at home is worth something too.

**My Honest Recommendation**

Start with one or two plugs for your biggest energy vampires. Test it out for a month and check your bill. If you like what you see, grab more. I found [some solid options here](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) that work with Alexa and Google Home without breaking the bank.

Don't go crazy buying them for every outlet in your house right away. Focus on things that draw power constantly or that you forget to turn off. Window AC units, space heaters, entertainment systems, and coffee makers are perfect candidates.

**Bottom Line**

Are smart plugs worth it? Yeah, I think so. They're not going to cut your electric bill in half, but they will reduce it. More importantly, they make daily life easier. Setting schedules once and forgetting about it beats manually unplugging stuff every day.

If you're looking to start reducing your energy costs without a huge upfront investment, [check out these smart plugs](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) and give them a shot. Worst case, you're out twenty bucks. Best case, you save money every month and make your home a bit smarter.

Just my two cents from someone who actually uses them daily. Not magic, but definitely useful.",1,1763057441.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False

I was weighing if I should or not and decided not, bc I don’t want to be late, AND I should be saving money more with the holidays coming up.      

Thinking about  money got me thinking about my hobbies. I was thinking about how I should make a pros and cons list of what I enjoy versus what I don’t enjoy anymore (and how to utilize that to possibly sell some stuff to make money).      

Then I started thinking about how effective pros and cons lists are, and if there have been any studies about the efficacy of those lists.      

That’s when I realized that I was thinking about the pros and cons of pros and cons lists and had all started from thinking about the multitude of hobbies that I’ve collected and the research and time and money I’ve put into learning as much as I can about those hobbies.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

1ow87ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/MAGARecovery/comments/1ow87ih/nobody_owns_my_mind/,Nobody Owns My Mind,"Mike wakes up, grabs his phone, and does what a lot of us do. Opens the same apps. Checks the same feeds. Within five minutes he has seen a headline about the country “on the brink,” a clip where someone from the other party says something outrageous, and a post warning that “people like you” are about to get steamrolled.

By the time he finishes his coffee, Mike is already bracing for impact. Nothing in his town has changed since yesterday. The bills are the same, the kids are the same, the sky is the same. But inside, he is already on high alert.

If that feels familiar, you are not alone. We are living through a kind of permanent psychological election season. Every day is “code red.” And if you lean right and mostly follow right leaning media, there is a decent chance your anger and loyalty have quietly become somebody else’s business model.

That is the heart of this piece.

I am not here to tell you to become a liberal, abandon your church, or pretend mainstream media suddenly started loving you. I am here to argue one thing.

A single partisan media diet can quietly trap decent, patriotic people in a distorted reality. Practicing what I will call “information self defense” lets you keep your values and your vote while taking back control of your own judgment.

If you remember nothing else, remember this:

When you let one set of talkers decide what counts as real, you are not being loyal, you are being managed.

The trap almost nobody thinks they are in

Most people do not wake up and say, “I would like to live in a bubble today.” You wake up and say, “I would like to know what is going on.”

The problem is not that you are stupid or gullible. The problem is that you are human.

Our brains are wired in a way that made sense on the savannah and makes a mess in modern media. We are built to protect our group. Deep down, it matters a lot whether someone feels like “us” or “them.”

Psychologists have run experiments that are almost comical. They show people the same numbers, the same chart, the same expert quote. All they change is the label. Sometimes the numbers supposedly support “your side.” Sometimes they support “the other side.”

Over and over, people read the math correctly when it helped their group, then suddenly “misread” it when it hurt their group. The smarter and more politically engaged they were, the stronger this effect got.

In other words, intelligence and passion did not make people more fair. It made them better at defending what they already believed.

If you are loyal, informed, and politically awake, that is you too. That is me too. This is not a left thing or a right thing. It is a human thing.

And this is exactly where a tight media world has you most exposed. If the voices you trust convince you that “we” always tell the truth and “they” always lie, your brain is halfway to rejecting any fact that arrives with the wrong logo on the corner of the screen. You never even give it a fair look.

That is the first part of the trap. Your loyalty, which is a real virtue, becomes the handle that lets someone else steer your perception.

Outrage is not an accident, it is a strategy

Now layer on the business side.

Every modern outlet is hungry. There are more channels, more podcasts, more newsletters than any human can follow. Attention is scarce. Outrage is cheap.

Media researchers who actually sit and code these shows have found that some opinion programs use insults, accusations, and dire warnings dozens of times an hour. Radio hosts do the same. Why? Because outrage keeps people from turning the dial.

You have felt it. Calm stories do not win the night. “This is complicated, nobody is pure, here are the trade offs” does not blow up on social media. “They hate you and they are coming for you” does.

On the right, there is something else going on. Surveys find that Republicans are more likely than Democrats to rely heavily on one or two sources while distrusting almost everything else. In practice, that often means “my channel, my favorite host, my usual cluster of sites.”

If you are in that world, you are a dream customer. You are loyal, you are committed, and you have nowhere else you trust to go.

I am not saying every host you listen to is evil. Some of them are sincere. Some do real reporting. But once an outlet knows its audience will not leave, the temptation is always there to crank the emotional volume, to shave a corner off the truth, to hype the story today and bury the correction on Friday.

The result is simple. Your anger becomes a product. Your sense of threat and loyalty are something that can be harvested, night after night, in exchange for your time and your trust.

And, like Mike, you start the day already flooded with adrenaline about events you have no control over, and no time to check.

The cost of living in a house of mirrors

People sometimes talk about “media bubbles” as if the only cost is “you do not hear the other side much.” That is the least of it.

Living in a one sided information house of mirrors does three deeper kinds of damage.

First, it warps your picture of the other half of the country. Studies where researchers ask Republicans and Democrats to guess what the average person in the other party believes are eye opening. On hot button issues, people routinely think the other side is far more extreme than it actually is.

If nine out of ten stories you hear about “them” come from people who already despise them, that should not be surprising. Caricatures are contagious.

Second, it warps your picture of your own side. If the only stories you hear about “us” are framed as heroics and unfair persecution, you start believing we can do no real wrong. When someone on your team lies, cheats, or stokes ugliness, it becomes easier to wave away, or you do not see it at all.

We saw this after the 2020 election. Court after court, many of them with Republican appointed judges, found no evidence of the massive fraud that some outlets screamed about every night. Yet millions came to believe, with absolute certainty, that the election had been stolen. Not because they carefully looked at the evidence themselves, but because their media loop told them so relentlessly.

Third, and maybe most painfully, the bubble comes home.

You have probably seen some version of this. Two people at the same table, in the same family, living in the same town, but on different feeds. One is on edge all day, convinced that the country will die if the next election goes the wrong way. The other is tired of being yelled at by screens and just wants to get through the week.

They are not arguing policy. They are arguing reality itself. “That never happened.” “Yes it did.” “You are brainwashed.” “No, you are.”

That is not just politics. That is a fracture in the way people see each other.

When your sense of what is real can be yanked around by whichever host you spent the most time with this week, you are less free, not more. You are easier to scare, easier to flatter, and easier to use.

That hurts you. It hurts your family. And in the long run, it hurts the very causes and country you are trying to defend.

A different kind of loyalty

So what do you do if you recognize even a piece of this in yourself?

You do not have to blow up your life or pretend you never cared. Real loyalty is not blind. Real loyalty is adult.

Call it information self defense.

Not a conversion. Not a “both sides are the same” shrug. A simple set of habits that make it harder for anyone to run your head for you.

Here is what that can look like.

First, you audit your media, not your beliefs.

For three days, you do not change anything. You just notice. Every time you get news or commentary, you jot down what you watched or listened to, roughly how long you spent, and one word for how you felt afterward. Angry. Motivated. Sick. Clear.

You do this privately. Nobody else has to see it. This is not about shame. It is about seeing your information diet the way you would see your food intake if you wrote it down for the first time in years.

Second, you add, you do not abandon.

One of the quickest ways to trigger defensiveness is to tell someone “stop watching that.” So do not.

Instead, pick one or two sources that are not part of your usual bubble. A centrist newsletter. A factual wire service. A local outlet that mostly just reports what happened. Even a mainstream network you dislike, as long as you treat it as an extra camera angle, not your new home.

Then, for a week, make yourself a simple deal. For every hour you spend with partisan opinion, you give yourself ten minutes with one of these alternate angles. You still get to eat your favorite food. You just add a vegetable.

Third, you watch the emotional pitch.

Any time a segment makes your heart pound and your jaw clench, pause for a moment. Ask yourself three questions.

What exactly are they asking me to believe?  
What are they asking me to feel about “us” and “them”?  
Who benefits if I swallow this whole and never look at it again?

You may end up believing the same thing you would have anyway. That is fine. The difference is that you chose it with your eyes open, not on autopilot.

Information self defense is not about becoming nicer to everybody. It is about refusing to be an easy mark.

“But our media is the only one that tells the truth”

At this point, you might be thinking something like this.

Mainstream media really are biased. Elite institutions really do lean left. People from my world really have been mocked and dismissed on the big networks. That is why I turned to our media in the first place. If I start listening to “them,” even a little, I am letting the enemy into my head.

I get that. There is real hurt behind it, and real experience. You have watched late night comics sneer at people of faith. You have watched anchors treat folks in small towns like exhibits. You have every right to be skeptical.

But even if you accept all of that, something else is still true.

Any media world, once it has you convinced that everyone outside is irredeemably crooked, becomes less accountable over time. When every critic can be dismissed as “fake” or “elitist,” there is less pressure to correct mistakes, admit when your side blew it, or show uncomfortable facts.

That is not unique to the right. It is what happens in any closed information environment. It is what happens in tight left wing circles online. It is what happens in certain activist spaces. It is what happens in cults.

The standard you really want, if you step back, is not “who says what I like most often.” It is “who helps me see more of what is actually real, including the parts that sting a little for my own team.”

Once that is your standard, information self defense is not a betrayal of your side. It is a way of honoring something higher than team, which is the truth, and the country that needs you to be in touch with it.

A free people do not hand their entire sense of reality to any one set of talkers.

What this could change for you, right now

Go back to Mike.

He tries the week. He does the little media log. He adds a centrist newsletter and a local news app. He does not ditch his favorite show. He just gives himself those extra camera angles.

He notices some things he cannot unsee.

He notices that certain hosts leave him furious but light on specifics. He notices that big stories get framed one way in his usual world and in a more boring way somewhere else, and that sometimes the boring version turns out to be closer to what actually happened. He notices that one outrage that had him steamed on Monday quietly disappears by Friday without explanation.

At the end of the week, he is still conservative. He still thinks his party is the better choice. But he is a little less jumpy and a little more grounded. He feels less like a passenger and more like a driver.

That is what I am inviting you into. Not a different tribe. A different posture.

You will be told again this year that everything is at stake. Some stakes are real. Some are inflated because panic drives engagement. The more the volume goes up, the more you will need a clear head.

Information self defense is how you keep that head.

A small challenge, if you are willing

Here is what I suggest, and you can start today.

For the next three days, do the media log. Nothing fancy. Just a scrap of paper or a notes app. What you watched or listened to, how long, and one word for how it left you feeling.

Then look at it. Really look at it.

If you do not like what you see, give yourself one experimental week of information self defense. Add one alternate source of your choosing. Keep your shows, but mix in those extra angles and those three questions when your emotions spike.

You are not signing a contract. You are not admitting you were wrong about everything. You are simply testing whether you feel more or less like yourself when you protect your own mind.

If you feel worse, you can stop. If you feel clearer, calmer, and harder to jerk around, you will have learned something valuable about who was really in charge before.

Because in the end, loyalty to a party or a host is optional. Loyalty to your own honest judgment should not be.",1,1763057129.0,MAGARecovery,0,1.0,False

26F and I've always been immensely spiritual. But right now, the past 2 months have felt ridiculously different. i quit my journalism job a few months ago because i felt that i didn't want to expend so much energy proving my skill set to society and moved to a law firm that pays me well and respects me. love it. but this was only scratching the surface.

the 2 months in question have been filled with extreme existential nihilism, or at least was nihilism at first. now it's more pleasant and beautiful to hold. but i've started to look at my 8-5 as a side gig, making my ""living"" a full time job. i'm aggresively saving so i can retire early (r/fire) and i just can't quiet recognize myself, in a good way. at least for now.

now, i genuinely enjoy the sun, reading a magazine or a book at a cafe with some coffee and not in a performative way but i genuinely like tending to myself. 

out of a whim, i even booked tickets to alaska to see the northern lights this december. something clicked, something snapped. one of my most favorite things is drinking coffee in my bed very early in the morning when dawn still hasn't cracked and it is still very, very dark. i did that only during work days when i was compelled to wake up early. but now, oh man but now i wake up at 6am on weekends just to see the the sun rise in the sky. 

another note - as i said, i was in a deep nihilism hole and really felt the insignificance of our presence here on earth. it felt almost unbearable that i had to go to work when everything we've ever known will be reduced to rubble and dust in a few billion years. and yes, yes i know. why is a billion years impacting me so much? but this helped me see how insignificant this slice of time is....however, our lives make this slice of time significant. wow. 

after affirming (half-heartedly and never fully understanding) that i matter just because i simply exist, i finally feel it. i have no fear of being seen, of being silly. i really enjoy my being.

a follow up to this question - if i am truly going through an awakening, is this it? do i realize more things? do i feel new emotions i've never felt before? because i feel this whole new spectrum of feelings and i really enjoy it.

Hey. I’ll try to keep this as simple as I can.

I’m \\\[M27\\\] in a small town in Indiana, about an hour from Dayton / Cincy, OH and Indy, IN. I’m only interested in something long-term with someone who has similar values and experience, and at least a couple similar hobbies. Think more “nerdy/introverted, has passions, wants a real relationship” than casual or hookup stuff.

I don’t really struggle with talking to people or making friends. The issues are when dating is involved—approaching someone I’m attracted to, or asking for a number, especially in public. I’ve had a few waitresses and random girls be friendly or keep talking to me even after I’ve paid, but I’ve never had the nerve to turn that into “Hey, can I get your number?” It’s not that I think I’d be creepy, it’s just anxiety tbh.

Dating apps are basically tapped out for me. I’ve had some decent matches, but nothing that really felt aligned, and I’m not interested in “good enough” just to be in a relationship. I know what I want in a relationship and I’m not the type to settle just to say I’m dating someone.

So... I’m trying to figure out a better approach.

Advice I'm looking for:

\* Where should I be going (locally or in Dayton/Cincy/Indy) to meet more nerdy/like-minded women IRL?
\* If you’re a woman like what I’m looking for, where do you actually spend time or meet people?
\* Any simple ways to approach someone in public (store, coffee shop, waitress, etc.) that don’t feel weird or forced?
\* For those who used to have approach anxiety, what helped you get past it?

I know “the worst they can say is no,” but in the moment I freeze up and don’t know what to say that doesn’t feel like I’m obviously only there to hit on them.

I’m open to questions in the comments or DMs if more context helps. Thank you for reading.",1,1763056881.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Observations from Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore","​I've just done some traveling in about last 45 days, back and forth between Bangalore, New Delhi, and Mumbai. And honestly, I’m left thinking something big and negative is happening to us as a society. I swear, the collective level of human patience, especially on the roads, is just gone!
​On the roads, forget about it.  Zero fucking tolerance. And it’s not just impatience; it's instant hostility. People are jumping signals, blocking intersections, and acting like their five-second delay is a personal tragedy. The aggression is shocking.. Logon ka dimag kharab ho gaya hai.., unmanaged rage is critically altering the whole mental state of the country.

​I keep thinking it’s all these Reels and Shorts. We trained our brains to get that instant hit, right? Feeling bored? swipe up, new stimulus, dopamine kick. Now when real life is slow—like traffic, a slow pedestrian, or waiting for a coffee—we just get disproportionately angry. It’s like we can't process slowness anymore; our internal buffer for boredom and delay is completely eliminated.

​ Only ten years ago, people were genuinely helpful! I remember people actually stopping and taking time out for strangers on the side of the road, even when they didn’t have to, feeling like it was part of society’s job. Now? Forget helping. Everyone is focused on getting ahead real fast. That willingness to pause and be a good citizen seems to be disappearing fast. From an anthropological point of view, losing this foundational patience is a terrible sign for the future of our society.

​TLDR: Traveling across BLR, DEL, and MUM showed a shocking decline in public patience, especially driving. My guess is short-form content is conditioning us to instant gratification, making us furious about minor delays and killing our capacity to be helpful and tolerant.",1,1763056873.0,AskIndia,1,1.0,False

I'll never forget my ex-husband's face. He didn't yell or cry, he just stood there staring at the screen while his mom collapsed into a chair. His dad walked out. The whole room went silent except for my daughter asking why everyone stopped singing.

The divorce was fast. He got a lawyer that same week. I tried explaining that Mike had been pursuing me for months, that he'd gotten me drunk that night specifically to sleep with me, but my ex said it didn't matter because I chose to keep seeing him after. Which, okay, fair. I did keep seeing him for like four months. But I ended it when I found out I was pregnant because I wanted to make things work with my husband.

Here's where it gets messier. My younger sister started dating Mike about a year after my divorce. At first I thought she was doing it to hurt me, but she swore she didn't know he was the guy. I never told anyone in my family who the actual father was, just that I'd had an affair. When I told her, she said she was already in love with him and that he'd changed.

They got married last summer. My parents went to the wedding. My brother was a groomsman. I wasn't invited obviously but my daughter was, and they literally gave her a gift at the reception calling her ""our favorite flower girl"" like she's some cute bonus kid and not evidence of what Mike did to her mother's marriage.

My ex-husband showed up as Mike's best man. Yeah. They're best friends again apparently. My sister told me they ""worked through everything"" and that my ex doesn't blame Mike anymore because ""the affair was my choice, not his."" She said Mike actually helped my ex through the divorce by letting him stay at his place and going to therapy with him.

I found out last week they all went on vacation together. My ex-husband, my sister, Mike, and Mike's parents. They posted photos on Facebook of them at some beach resort in Mexico, all smiling and holding drinks. There was one photo of my ex giving my sister away at her wedding that I'd never seen before and the caption said ""family forever.""

My daughter saw the photos on my laptop and asked why daddy was on vacation with Aunt Sarah and ""that man from the party."" I tried explaining but she started crying saying she missed daddy and wanted to go to the beach too. She's five. She doesn't understand why her dad moved out or why he only takes her on supervised visits now or why he looks so sad when he picks her up.

I called my sister yesterday and lost it. I told her she was a traitor for marrying the man who destroyed my marriage and for parading around with my ex-husband like they're one big happy family while I'm over here trying to explain to my daughter why her father can barely look at her. She said I destroyed my own marriage and that I should be grateful they're willing to help parent my daughter since ""clearly I can't be trusted to make good decisions.""

Then she said the worst part. She said my ex-husband is paying for their next vacation to Europe and that they're talking about having kids soon. She said maybe when they have a baby, my daughter can have ""a sibling she can actually know"" unlike her half-siblings from Mike's previous marriage who want nothing to do with her.

I hung up. Then I called my parents. They said I was being unreasonable and that I can't expect everyone's lives to stop because I made mistakes. My mom actually said ""you're lucky Mike is such a good man for not demanding custody when he's clearly the better parent.""

This morning my ex's lawyer emailed about modifying our custody arrangement. He wants more time with our daughter and he wants Mike listed as an approved caregiver. The email mentioned my ""unstable emotional state"" and included screenshots of texts I sent my sister last night that I don't even remember sending because I was so upset.

My best friend says I should just let it go and be grateful my daughter has people who want to be involved in her life. But how am I supposed to watch my ex-husband and my sister play house with the man who recorded me without my consent and destroyed everything? How am I supposed to smile and coparent when they're all going on family vacations together?

My mom just texted saying if I keep ""making trouble"" they're going to support my ex in court. She said I'm being selfish and that my daughter deserves stability even if that means less time with me.

I don't know anymore. Maybe they're right. Maybe I am being selfish. But it feels like everyone just forgot what actually happened and I'm the villain now for being upset about it. AITAH?

1ow81sy,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1ow81sy/creatine_its_no_love_story/,Creatine - It's no love story,"This is my personal experience of Creatine, the currently alleged wonder drug.

If you're reading this you're likely trying to make your mind up whether to go onto it, or whether to stop it. My advice is don't start it, and come off it. Here's why.

**Context - my fitness levels**

I have trained since as boy. I am in my fifties now. My regime is in general running five to six days a week, at an average of 10ks each run. I also do a 35-40 minute core strength regime 6 days a week - this involves the usual things you can do at home with some 10kg dumb bells or a resistance (12kg) band. The resistance covers things like push ups, tricep dips, sit ups, leg raises, arm work, squats and lunges etc. Five sets. I have a VO2 Max of 54 and am reasonably lean but still have good muscular definition.

**Reason I went on to Creatine and Regimen**

I went onto it because one day, whilst doing the isometric and strength work I was letting YouTube run through various articles. Up popped 'Creatine - the miracle cure', or words to that effect. I watched the entire video. More videos came up. The claims were bold - better mental clarity, bigger muscles, better muscle recovery, greater strength, and it went on and on. As I sometimes tired on my last set of reps, or in the last 1 to 2k of a run, I thought 'I've got to give this a go, surely?'. Then the clincher - every reviewer said 'it's very well tolerated, there are little to no side effects'. This, as I was to find out, and I'm sure many others have found out, is a load of nonsense.

I tried the 5mg scoop sometimes a bit more (6-7mg) each day for a week. Got side effects within a day or so, tried to persevere, and then had a good break, tried again, rinse and repeat. I tried three times, and each time was careful to start on a lower dose, try to adapt, etc etc. I also tried two types and brands.

***My side effects***

*Bloating* \- well reported. The 'pushers' of this drug online say 'some people will have bloating'. Well, a lot seem to. I did. My belt is usually on 5 notches, and I had to drop a whole notch - that's around an inch and a bit, maybe 2.5 centimetres, just on my waste. My chest bloated up, as did my face a little - especially around the eyes.

*Breathing* \- I am usually warmed up and my breathing is settled after my first hill on the runs. When I walk anywhere my breathing is easy. A few days into taking this I would still breathe OK, but it always felt like I was running in high humidity and it wasn't quite right. If I came off it, a day or so later my breathing would be back to normal, and easy. I noted on high intensity strength training where aerobic fitness is less acute, that this had no impact and my strength tolerance was marginally better initially, but became worse more quickly - my endurance worsened but the initial burst increased. I think this was down to cardiac changes as my heart became less efficient - see below.

*Cardiac* \- My resting heart rate during sleep after several days of exercise and not if I have had a sustained anaerobic load is 45bpm. I noted that every time I went on creatine this would rise over the days I was on it. 47, then 48, 49 and 50bpm. I would only normally be in the 50s after a glass of alcohol (I did not drink at all when taking this supplement, nor was I sick, or run down). More disconcertingly I would get an occasional PVC - premature ventricular contraction, or ectopic beats. These would be forceful. I also noted pulsatile tinnitus sometimes when lay on a pillow. Creatine is known to specifically alter calcium levels in the muscles - and the heart is a muscle, so I can assume from this that, like cardiac medication that can act as a calcium channel blocker - that creatine can sufficiently alter some people's calcium levels to an extent that it alters the timing of the QRS interval to such a degree that you will get ectopic beats.

I felt, particularly at night - that my heart was working unduly hard because of water retention, and the effect of calcium in the conduction system of my heart. It was a subtle effect, but notable none the less.

B*rain* \- People rave about this. I found I was more absent minded and more prone to agitation or mood swings.

*Fatigue* \- Overall I was much more tired on this drug. I felt like I had had a few beers the night before - bloated, tired, not great. Usually before a run, even if I'm mentally tired, I can bring myself into an alert state by giving myself a good talking to, or a small coffee, but nothing worked on this drug.

*Food intolerances* \- I am sensitive to some foods in high quantities. I can tolerate anything in low quantities. However, on creatine I found even small amounts of some food would be a problem, and cause a reaction of some sort.

**Conclusion**

Make of this what you will. Some people swear by it. Personally, taking a drug that alters the calcium levels in your body that has a direct and indirect adverse effect on your electrical conduction in your heart, and affects the stroke and pumping rate of your heart, possibly by altering you renal function, is a massive risk not worth taking - for anyone. I felt heavier, more bloated, more tired, more grumpy, less tolerant, less sharp.

People may come back and say 'maybe you have a health problem'. Well I had all my bloods done prior, an echo stress test, and various other health assessments, and all were fine. The results were similar to what they have been the last 15 years. My Garmin told me all I needed to know and this is key for any endurance athletes to think about. Normally my Garmin tells me I need a rest day once in about ten days. So maybe three times a month. On Creatine it was telling me to take two rest days in a week, every time!!!

So if you want my advice, save your money and treat yourself to a nice pizza and a bottle of red wine once a month as a thank you to yourself for all of your hard training. If you don't drink, then maybe a nice flat white and a Danish. But for the love of God, do not take this toxin.

Good luck!!!",0,1763056796.0,bodyweightfitness,10,0.1,False

I have the Oliver sofa from west elm which is pretty warm grey and thought I would get two swivel chairs. I noticed that desaturated soft blues look nice in the room and the orangey pillow seems to work with my rug. Would two rusty orange chairs look good or two light grey chairs? I had a sample chair that was grey but almost mixed with a warm ivory and it did not match. Not sure if I need beige or a cool toned grey. I’m not sure if it needs a pop of colour or not. Would love any advice anyone has as I suck at this!!

Until I met mine. Sitting down to coffee it was like I met someone my soul had been searching for for lifetimes. I can't explain it. I was not looking for anyone. I'm not a flirty person or typically pick up on ""vibes."" Since that day, I have always known exactly who he is to me, but not been able to articulate it. I can feel him when he's hurting and I know in my gut when something is off and we aren't together.  He is clairvoyant and extremely spiritual by profession and nature. We have had incredible adventures around the world together....but the fights are SO turbulent. If I were to explain it, others might say he is abusive and controlling, which may be true on a human level, but I also get it....we feel each other so deeply are we bound to trigger each other so much? I have never in my life experienced a relationship like this. Sometimes I wonder if it has run it's course (2 years)?  But then I feel into it with my soul and I know EXACTLY who he is and, once I breathe past my own human-ness and emotions, always come back to the souls truth.  

I don't really know why I'm sharing...I'm just curious for the feedback from those who understand such a connection and can maybe hear me outside the traditional context of relationship rules. Thanks to anyone for a compassionate response.",1,1763056511.0,twinflames,1,1.0,False

The world is soft and gray, a cool morning chill in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

*Fuck*.

The rumbling of footsteps grew louder and louder as the mob of goons approached me, and I was helpless to defend myself. I slammed the door shut with my shoulder and shimmied over to the coffee table like an earthworm. My limbs started to tingle a little bit, which was a good sign. I guess Mickey wasn’t bullshitting–I’d be able to use them again in a couple of minutes, assuming I could survive that long.

Using my head, I was able to flip the coffee table on its side to use as a barricade. It wasn’t much, but it could buy me a couple of seconds, and at that moment, each second was worth its weight in gold.

There was a knock at the door.

“Open up and we won’t shoot,” a voice said.

“Do you really expect me to believe that?” I shouted. Why didn’t they just kick it down and blast me away?

“Come on, just open the door. We don’t need to resort to violence.”

I didn’t respond, and a dozen people started talking over each other on the other side of the door. That’s when I finally realized what was going on: this group of heavily armed hardened criminals were scared of me. They knew what Mickey was capable of and they knew that I was cut from the same cloth. They were worried that I’d rip them all apart if they opened that door.

And they were right.

Sensation slowly came back to my limbs. I could move them, but they felt heavy, like someone else’s arms and legs had been sewn to my torso. I forced myself to my feet and awkwardly crouched behind the coffee table.

“Hey, if y’all don’t want to fight, why don’t you just fuck off?” I asked. “Go get a real job. Food Lion’s always hiring.”

There was some more chatter, like some were actually considering it, and the buzzing in my limbs reduced to a slight fizz.

The man sighed. “Alright, if you’re not going to come willingly, we’re gonna have to take you out.”

“You sure you want to do that?”

The sound of a dozen clips going into a dozen guns was their response. I clenched my fist and waited for them to kick down the door.

Mickey had fucked up. In the heat of the moment, he left his Zippo lighter wedged between the couch cushions. These guys fucked up too by not taking me out when they had the chance. I became nauseous, and not from the slime. Was I really about to murder god-knows how many people just to get to Mickey? Maybe I could knock them over and get out before they could catch me. I’d whooped people’s asses before, sure, but I’d never killed anyone. Taking someone’s life was some heavy shit, especially the way I was about to do it. But I knew that running was a stupid idea. They’d catch me, more than likely. And they’d hunt me down if they didn’t. Plus, that would mean that Mickey’d won. Fuck that.

I sent a narrow stream of slime under the door. Groans broke out in the crowd, and there were a few thumps against the wall from people slipping. I kept it flowing until I was fairly certain the whole hallway was nice and lubricated. Then I sparked the Zippo and tossed it onto the snail trail.

The slime lit up like napalm, and chorus of discordant shrieks erupted right along with it. I covered my ears, but the high-pitched wails pierced through my hands and dug into my brain. They screamed wild, desperate screams, hoping that some benevolent force of nature would come to their rescue, but nothing could save them now. Death was their only way out.

After a few agonizing seconds, the screaming stopped.

I wrapped my shirt around the hot door handle and swung it open. Charred goons littered the hall. Some of them were stiff, black corpses lying motionlessly on the floor. Those were the lucky ones. A few unfortunate bastards were still alive, though. They crawled away from me, skin sloughing off of their arms and legs as it stuck to the floor. Holy shit, what had I done? The pain they were in must have been absolutely unimaginable. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy–well, maybe my worst enemy–yet I just inflicted it on these people that I didn’t even know. They should’ve just left me the fuck alone. They could’ve handed me Mickey and this could’ve never happened. I couldn’t stand looking at these people anymore, pointlessly trying to escape. They were dead. Why didn’t they understand that?

I took the pistol out from my waistband and shot them, one by one, in the backs of their heads. They looked happier for it.

I looked to my right, down the corridor. This place was huge. They must’ve been supplying the entire southeastern United States with drugs. There were ten rooms just on this floor, and a staircase all the way at the end. There could‘ve easily been a hundred more people waiting for me in the compound, and Mickey was using them all as human shields.

Fuck them. They chose this life. They’ve probably done worse to innocent people. I’m doing a goddamn civil service, killing these lowlifes. I told myself, over and over, hoping I’d eventually believe it.

I’d kill every last one of them to get to Mickey if that’s what it took.

I believed that.

Aside from me and the pile of corpses at my feet, the corridor was empty. All of the other doors that lined the hall were closed, and nobody dared to come out. Once the adrenaline left my veins, I noticed that my entire right arm was throbbing. The mark liked the taste of blood, I guess, because it was bright red, and three new blisters appeared in the fold of my elbow. Each blister contained a crude picture made of darkened skin. One had a nose, one had a foot, and one had a shield.

The mark was speaking to me in goddamn hieroglyphics. Great.

I had no idea what it meant. Block foot smells? Nosey steppers afoot? I didn’t have time for riddles, so I just pressed the first one to see what would happen. It flattened out into nothing, just like the blister on my hand did before, and the other two followed without me touching them. I itched from the inside once again, and the mark crawled up my shoulder, covering my entire arm with black blobs. It felt like I was in a bathtub full of fire ants, but the itching subsided quickly this time, and I kept myself from falling over.

The itching stopped and suddenly I felt great.

I felt fucking incredible, actually. It was like I had instantly become ten years younger. I was lighter on my feet, and my body felt harder, more solid. Out of nowhere, my arms had some noticeable muscle definition for the first time in my lanky-ass life. The mark was very happy with me, it seemed. And all I had to do to curry its favor was mercilessly slaughter an entire mob of people. Kinda fucked up, honestly, but I almost forgot that I felt bad about it. I wanted to go run a marathon.

I was about to hop and skip straight to the elevator to shove Mickey’s head into his own ass when the overwhelming urge to sneeze came over me. There was something in my nose completely blocking my right nostril. The urge got worse and worse, but I never actually sneezed. It didn’t want to come out on its own, so I covered my left nostril with my thumb and snorted as hard as I could out of my right. The largest booger I had ever seen in my life shot from my nose like a missile and splattered on the floor a few feet away. A second later, it exploded and left a black crater in the concrete.

Booger bombs? Seriously?

That’s what the mark had blessed me with this time: booger bombs. Mickey could make people’s bodies useless with a single touch, and I could shoot snot rockets.

Okay, whatever. I had to keep moving. I didn’t want to be in this weird ass industrial drug complex any longer than I needed to be. I walked down the hallway, slowly, expecting someone to pop out of one of the doors at any moment, but nobody had the balls to fuck with me now. I got to the elevator and pressed the button.

LEVEL 2 ACCESS REQUIRED. PLEASE SCAN KEYCARD

Damnit. Why can’t something be fucking easy for once?

I had to get a keycard. One of the losers on this floor had to have one. My patience was starting to wear thin with these people.

I shouted down the hall. “I bet you all thought you were real tough when you were roughing up junkies on the street, huh? Why don’t you come and pick on someone your own size?”

I picked my nose, flicked a booger at the door to my right, and blew it off of its hinges. Maybe booger bombs weren’t so bad. Four men who looked like they were halfway through shitting their pants cowered behind a bar, barely peeking over it to look at me. They must’ve ran to the bar in a hurry; broken liquor bottles littered the floor, and a deck of cards was scattered around their poker table. I had pooped their party, it seemed.

I flicked the Zippo open and held my hand behind the flame.

“Any of you move a goddamn inch and you’re all getting deep fried,” I said. “Do any of you have a level 2 keycard?”

“He does!” one of them squeaked and pushed a little balding man out from behind the bar. I pointed the lighter at him.

“No I don’t! What the fuck, Carl?” he spat. “Really, I don’t I swear!”

I wasn’t going to deal with this bullshit. I burned him alive. It’s amazing how quickly you can get used to killing people, honestly. I didn’t feel nearly as bad about it the second time around.

He convulsed on the ground, writhing in agony, and I resumed my conversation with the other three.

“Did he really not have a keycard?”

“I dunno. I thought he did,” Carl shrugged.

I guess this was the room where they kept all the fucking morons.

I turned to leave, and a bullet flew by my head. I whipped back around to see the pudgy young man to Carl’s right shakily holding a gun, mouth agape. Three of them almost got away with their lives, but they just had to provoke me. I flicked a booger and it hit Carl right in the middle of his forehead. It popped his head like a water balloon and took an arm each off of the other two. I left them with some booger bombs of their own and shut the door behind me before they went off.

“Alright, which one of you shitheads has a keycard?” I yelled down the corridor. “Just come out and save everyone else. If you don’t, you’ll die anyway.”

A door on the opposite end of the hallway opened up, and a rail-thin man wearing torn jeans and a mullet that went down to his ass crack came out with a massive burlap sack slung over his shoulder like he was Santa Claus for meth heads. He threw the sack down in front of him with a grunt and looked at me, then pulled a keycard from his pocket and waved it around.

“You want this? Come and get it, asshole!”

He grabbed a grenade from his sack of goodies and hurled it down the corridor.",2,1763056364.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

At least, I’m pretty sure she did. At one point we had each other’s phone numbers, but we never texted since we were constantly online together. When I upgraded my phone after my old one bricked, none of my contacts imported. All I had left were our DMs.

We DM’d constantly—Tumblr, Instagram, Facebook before I deleted mine. Most days, almost all day, just chatting back and forth about a lot of things, but mostly her passion for the Marvel character Darcy Lewis. We became friends on Tumblr in the Marvel trenches around 2013. One of our ships crossed over, and we bonded over it. We became, as she put it, *Mind Twins*, because we often had the same headcanons and had a habit of reading or looking for the same fanfics at the same time without planning it.

She was diagnosed with a brain tumor a decade ago. It was in a place too risky for surgeons to touch, so she had to live with it. She went to school for archaeology and nerded out when I sent her X-rays of my teeth.

She took theater classes. One semester they got to choose a short scene from a movie to perform, but they were assigned random partners. She and her partner decided to act out the scene in the first *Avengers* movie where Black Widow first meets Bruce Banner. After class, she called me in a fury over her partner’s portrayal of Bruce. Ever-protective of Bruce and the Hulk, she ranted for half an hour before calming down enough to laugh at herself. We watched the first *Avengers* movie together that night over Skype.

When she graduated, she got a job at a museum, and I made terrible heist jokes at her a dozen times a day. She got sick a lot. On the days she ended up stuck at home, we watched *White Collar* together and made moon eyes at Matt Bomer. Then she got diagnosed again. It was good and bad news. Good news: she finally knew what was wrong with her. Bad news: brain cancer.

She sent me an X-ray of her brain tumor, and we cried together. I stopped complaining about things to her—it felt wrong to bring her that stuff anymore. So I only sent her the good things: happy videos, funny memes, and fandom conspiracies I knew she’d enjoy. Then she got too sick to work. That pissed her off so much. She tried every diet, every gimmick, every “cancer-healing” thing she could find.

Our DMs dwindled to a single source. Instagram became all we had. She didn’t post there much. Her mother moved her bed into the living room to care for her. She stopped having the energy for Skype calls and movie nights pretty early on, but this shift felt more radical. Like we were approaching a cliff, and no one was hitting the brakes.

But there were no brakes. Surgery wasn’t an option, and chemo only helped so much. Before long, she was talking to me about nurses pushing her to make a plan for her death. That pissed her off. I think rage gave her energy, because nothing else did. She was so tired, but she still had a passion for life. She didn’t want to die.

The last DM I got from her was February 2024 at 1:31 p.m. She sent me a video about a dog show because I trained dogs. I have sent her something at least once a week since then, but there’s been no reply.

I don’t know her mother’s name. Her father died more than a decade ago. I have no way to find out when she passed or if her family is doing okay. I want to tell her mother how often my friend said she loved her. How often she praised and was thankful for those around her. She loved her museum job. She loved her dogs. She loved coffee, Darcy Lewis, and Bruce Banner.

She was my online best friend, and I miss her deeply.

Love you, Mind Twin.

1ow7t1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1ow7t1x/feeling_incredibly_frustrated/,Feeling incredibly frustrated,"Hi all. For a little over a year I've been going through some unexplained GI issues. 

This all started right before I left for vacation, I ate a sandwich from a local pizza shop, a few hours later I had some intense stomach cramps, and sorry to be so graphic, but it was this yellow diarrhea. After that I went away on my trip for a week, I felt bloated all the time in my upper abdomen and my stools were loose the entire time. When I got home I threw up and started to have gastritis like symptoms. My appetite crashed, I lost 30 pounds in like a month since I literally could not eat. I had an endoscopy that showed mild gastritis, I had a colonoscopy that came back perfect, blood tests nearly perfect, the only thing that was 'off' was my alt levels (which are showing a smidge off from normal), and a vitamin D insufficiency, and my platelets dropped just under the normal range. I've had extended liver tests to make sure everything is ok there, the function tests are great and my CT and ultrasound with elastography came back absolutely perfect. I've had my GP, 2 GI doctors, a rheumatologist, and a hematologist run vigorous tests against me and no one can determine what the hell is going on. 


I'm a 38 year old male, I'm very active, I have never had any stomach issues ever. I literally had an iron stomach. My diet before wasn't bad, I made the majority of my meals at home, I will admit fiber wasn't always prioritized but I've always felt pretty good. 

When I first got sick, I was basically surviving off of ensure, broth, and plain chicken, fish and rice, for months. 

My symptoms were upper and middle abdominal cramps/dullness
Weakness and fatigue
Insomnia really bad
Brain fog
Zero energy
Histamine reactions
Anexiety 
Pelvic floor issues (frequent urination)

I felt like a shell of myself, it was scary. I gradually started to get better by spring, and by summer I was basically back to my normal self, I was able to work out, be active, eat whatever I wanted without any reactions, I reintroduced coffee and even alcohol (a few beers on the weekends). I felt pretty great. And BMs were good, formed.

The only thing I supplemented while I was sick was Align probiotics, Manuka honey, a multi vitamin, kefir, and other fermented foods. I have no idea if this helped my healing process or what. But once I was back to feeling good I stopped.

Here's the strange part, just about a year on the dot the the same thing happened again, I had a stomach cramp, yellow diarrhea, back to feeling like shit. This time my anxiety is through the roof, my lower abdomen is dull/achy, I got bad brain fog but that has since gotten better, my legs feel weak and sore, my energy levels are shot, I get itchy, I bloat no matter what I eat. 

I started having panic attacks, I changed my diet to incorporate more fiber and vegetables, I will admit I probably went too fast into this change and should have gradually made the change. My legs would get pins and needles and feel numb/cold at times, that is starting to resolve. 

I was convinced I had SIBO, so I had a lactilose test yesterday and guess what, negative. I wanted to lose it, there is something wrong with me and my team of doctor's can't figure it out. 

I can't continue doing this, but I'm determined in fixing whatever the hell this is, again. I'm just so overwhelmed by the supplements out there and reading other people's posts on what they did makes me even more confused. I'm scared of trying anything because of some horror stores with reactions to supplements. 

I know doom scrolling is making whatever I have worse, my health anexiety is so bad, I'm just grasping at straws to figure out, what do I need to do. I've diagnosed myself countless times and I've been wrong everytime. I am taking Lexapro as well, but I don't think that's helping anymore.

Could it be my gut is pissed off and I need to go back to using probiotics and fermented food? I was thinking of trying saccharomyces boulardii since I read it can target some of the bad stuff and set me up for the good bacteria. 

One thing I do want to mention. I walk 3 miles every day and play hockey once a week. When I'm active, my symptoms basically vanish, it's strange.

I don't know what I wanted out of this post, I'm at my wits end, I wanted to vent, I probably shouldn't have posted since trying to do my own research is adding stress on top of everything. 

I haven't taken any antibiotics or any medications for that matter. I avoid medicine unless absolutely necessary. 

Also zero food allergies or celiac, been tested several times.

1ow7s5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ow7s5s/my_guy_crush_transitioned_help/,My guy crush transitioned. Help!,"Hello everyone,

This is a throwaway account. I'm also going to apologize in advance if my post comes off as insensitive. So I (22M) am in a bit of an awkward dilemma. There’s this gorgeous girl who works at one of the coffee chains I frequent. Let's call her “L”. She immediately caught my eye. She looked so familiar, and after an awkward moment of me asking if I knew her from somewhere, she said yes, and... that was about the extent of our conversation (it’s a drive-thru place, so interactions are short).

A week later, I couldn't stop thinking about her, and it finally hit me who she was. We met back in high school during COVID “A days and B days”. All of my close friends were on A days. I had B days, so I was alone during lunch until an acquaintance introduced me to her friend group. That's where I met L. Back then, L wasn’t out as trans, at least not to my knowledge. Despite that, I had realized early on that I had this weird attraction to her. My heart would race when she’d sit next to me. I loved making her laugh and hearing about her day. It was confusing, considering that I’ve always liked girls, only girls, so I didn’t fully understand it. Either way, it was a running joke that she was my guy crush, but I never considered pursuing anything more.

Now, well, things have changed. Here's the issue: unless she changed her number, I technically still have it, but I’m 99% sure she doesn’t go by her old name anymore, and I have no Idea what her new name is. Also, texting her after all these years would be weird, no? I really don’t want to make her uncomfortable by bringing up her past or accidentally using her dead name. I also don’t want to come off as a chaser or shallow. What if I'm just someone from her past she'd rather not see again? I really don't know what to do. 

I’ve seen her a couple more times at the drive-thru since, but I get too nervous to say much. My confidence has been really low lately, and I think I’ve forgotten how to hold a normal conversation with someone in real life. It’s also really hard to read her body language, whether she’s open or fond of me, because, well, she’s working. Still, I really want to reconnect or at least say something meaningful beyond “thanks, have a nice day.”

So I need advice:

How can I bring up that I remember who she is in a respectful and sensitive way?

Is it okay to stop by again soon and try to talk to her more, or would that be intrusive/ creepy?

Should I just leave it and hope we run into each other outside of her work?

I don’t want to be weird or overstep. Seeing her again felt like a breath of fresh air, as cliché as that sounds, and I’d really like to pursue a friendship/ maybe something more with her. So please help. ",3,1763056200.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I've been on this subreddit every now and then; sometimes I find people to chat with, but then they disappear after a few messages (or a week or two). They must have their reasons, and I'm not going to judge or criticize them. I know life can get tough sometimes.

So I'm going to introduce myself again.  
I'm Pablo from Chile (way out in the middle of nowhere, way down south), I'm 40, a photographer by profession, an amateur writer, and the owner of a small coffee shop in my city.  
I don't have kids, i consider myself childfree but i like children but neither my partner nor I want to start a family (although we live together in sin because we are not married lol)

In my free time I like to watch movies, series and even play the occasional video game to relax from everyday life.  
As a writer, I have some authors who have been my inspiration to write, such as Tolkien, Stephen King, Murakami, and perhaps others who are more local to my country (I am currently writing a detective novel).  
I prefer more relaxed video games, or at least I've always been more of a fan of RPGs (Final Fantasy IX holds a special place in my heart), but I always keep an eye on what's coming in this subculture of games.

As for photography, I mainly focus on portraits, corporate, couples, children, and cosplay (and yes, I'm a cosplayer on hiatus).  
I like to talk about everything, about nothing, about life, about serious or fun things, so at least with me you can vent if you've had a bad day or even celebrate that you've achieved something good.

Because of my age, you might consider me an older brother if you need someone to listen to, and if I can, I'd love to give you advice or at least make you feel heard.

I lost 5 pounds around Christmas last year and have struggled to keep in a deficit for more than a month at a time, which has never yielded much results. I can only assume consistency is the issue.

I'm back to eating 1400 calories a day and making sure I get in 5,000 steps minimum (average around 6k). I lift weights about 3 days a week and do progressive overload. Sometimes I play basketball. I'm not overly hungry at all, but definitely much weaker in the gym. Definitely could eat way more, but I really want to lose these 5 pounds by January. I would be over the moon at 148-145 pounds by March when I'm getting married.

I have been extremely consistent for the last 4 weeks and haven't eaten more than 1500 calories on any given day. I weigh all my food and know exactly what I'm eating, but the scale has only shifted about a pound in the last four weeks. I'm generally eating rice and tofu with vegetables and tons of eggs/egg white burritos or sandwiches (vegetarian). I know weight loss isn't linear but I'm not shedding a ton, even after a month. Does the weight come off easier the longer you go? Am I eating too many carbs and sugar?

Trying to be as consistent as possible before Thanksgiving, get back on track after a slight cheat holiday weekend, and then be at around 150 by Christmas or mid-January. Is this unreasonable?

ETA: just for reference, I typically eat the following:

Breakfast: Oikos Yogurt, 120-150 calories, 11g protein

Lunch: Rice with carrots, edamame, and tofu. 300-350 calories, 12g protein

Dinner: varies, but usually eggs and potatoes for about 300-450 calories, maybe 15-20g protein

I'll usually have some more yogurt or cheese at the end of the night. Sometimes some Halo or Yasso ice cream, pretzels with chocolate chips, etc. I don't drink coffee with creamer and there are no hidden calories I'm not accounting for.",3,1763056135.0,CICO,4,1.0,False

In the past year, I started drinking coffee more regularly, and this past year has been the worst for my migraines. In the past month, I've cut out coffee and switched back to tea, which I usually drink. I then had a 9 day streak without a headache, which felt like a miracle! Since I am a scientific person and wanted to do a little test, I ordered a *decaf* latte. I miss the taste of lattes so, so much. I thought, maybe it was the overloading on caffeine that was giving me the migraines. I enjoyed my drink in the morning, then by 3pm, I was right back to the depths of my worst migraines, wanting to pluck my right eyeball out of my head to make the pain stop. I took my aleve, propanelol, magnesium, electrolytes, eventually my rizatriptan; I ate a whole cucumber, a burger and a coke, iced my head and neck; nothing worked, as per usual. Eventually, when it got late enough in the day, I took a benedryl to put myself to sleep. Woke up today totally fine. This is also the second time I've tested my coffee trigger, and I feel confident in saying it 100% gives me awful headaches. 

Does anyone else have this experience?

Happy to purchase coffee etc. to cover our time using the spot.

I got tired of paying €144/year for Grammarly when I only used it twice a month.  
  
So I built TextRewriter, a simple AI bot that lives in Telegram. No app to download, no monthly charges, just one command and your text is instantly rewritten.  
  
The bot rewrites text in 5 professional tones: professional, casual, concise, expanded, and persuasive. It's like having Grammarly directly in your messaging app, except you pay once and use it forever.  
  
I built it with Python, OpenAI GPT-4o, and Telegram Stars for payments. No credit cards, no external checkout, everything happens inside Telegram.  
  
You can try 50 free rewrites to see if it works for you, then unlock lifetime access for less than €50.

1ow7o9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramas/comments/1ow7o9n/this_month_is_my_kdrama_one_year_anniversary/,This month is my KDrama one year anniversary.,"This month is my KDrama one year anniversary.

I started watching Kdrama romances to soothe my aching heart last November. What I didn’t know was most Korean romance shows are Dramas with capital D. And yet I still  fell in love with them. including the ones with heavy themes of grief and trauma. It’s funny I was looking for something non-triggering and instead found the emotionality of kdramas soothing to my soul.

I’m mostly a reader and used to hardly watch any narrative TV, because I just didn’t find much I enjoyed. Kdramas feel like novels though, at least most the ones I watch. I’m drawn in by the obvious beginning, middle and end. They are so satisfying. I love the way kdramas are character driven stories with full circle arcs for the leads and many of the side characters.

After a month or two of watching kdramas I realized, I guess this is what I’m doing this year and starting tracking shows watched, etc. Instead of giving star/number ranking I ended up putting them into these buckets below. I found some shows are really great like CLOY and Mr Sunshine and while I enjoyed them a lot I didn’t completely love them.

So here are the 58 shows I’ve finished and which of my buckets they ended up in.

* She messaged my mum happy birthday even though she wasn't close to her and only seen her 3x a year (day 10 NC)
* I then went to get my first lot of stuff on day 13 and I asked her for coffee to try and rekindle things and she kept saying ""I don't know"" and ""I'm not sure"" and then said I was ""overwhelming her"" so I left her house but then rang her 2 minutes later which obv looked very weak
* Went NC for 18 days and she reached out Sunday night about mail in my name that has turned up to her house and wondering what she should do with it either screenshot and send to me over message or send to my house - I said I will pick it up with the rest of my stuff in 3 days
* I was late turning up at her house so she text and called me to see where I was and I got there and I said I'm here and to open the door and the door was open and I thought she left me to it but she came downstairs and I did 2 trips to car and back with all my bags and I came to the door and I said ""Is that everything?"" she said ""Yeah I think so"" and I said ""Okay thanks cya then"" and hesitated for a second and she stood there with a surprised smirk on her face and walked to the lounge (to possibly cry? I'm not sure) and I just left and been NC since (this was yesterday)

I’m really grateful to have gone straight from university into a secure position, especially since I know many others from my course are still struggling to find work. My job isn’t full-time — I work around 25 hours a week — but the pay is good, so I don’t mind the lighter schedule.

I’ve stayed in the same city where I earned my degree, about a four-hour drive from my hometown. I love it here and knew I didn’t want to move back home to look for work. By all accounts, life is going well — yet I feel incredibly lonely. When I’m not working, I often find myself bored and without plans. Work is really the only thing that consistently gets me out of the house, which I know isn’t ideal.

I meet friends for coffee a few times a week, but that usually lasts an hour or two. I also joined a book club, but it only meets once a month. I didn’t anticipate how big a change it would be to go from the fast-paced lifestyle of balancing full-time studies and a part-time job to having a position with fewer hours and much more downtime. It’s been harder on me mentally than I expected. I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this or has any suggestions on how to deal with this transition.

You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

But last week, I had enough of one coworker’s constant snide remarks and attempts to make me look bad in front of our team. Let’s call him Dan.

Dan has this annoying habit of taking credit for other people’s ideas and subtly mocking anyone who doesn’t perform the way he thinks they should. One day, he even made a big deal about me spilling coffee in the break room, calling me clumsy in front of a few clients who happened to walk by.

I decided I wasn’t going to let him walk over me anymore, but I wanted to do it without creating a huge scene. So I came up with a little plan.

I started making a batch of fancy iced coffees every morning, like the ones you’d pay $5 for at a café and left them in the break room with a little note: ""*Free coffee for anyone who wants it! Have a great day!”*

Dan, of course, saw it and assumed it was some kind of humble brag or company competition. But here’s the fun part: I made sure to write *one extra special cup* for him with a note saying, *“Thanks for helping me learn patience, love, the clumsy one.”*

By the end of the week, he had politely refused three times, each time with a bit of visible frustration as other coworkers casually enjoyed the iced coffees I’d made. Finally, he couldn’t resist the curiosity and took the cup. When he read the note, his face went pale. He didn’t say anything, but after that, the mocking stopped.

For now, it doesn’t support LaTeX, but I’m considering adding it as an option alongside Markdown.

My idea is to let people write freely, capture tasks, ideas, and other structured elements without rigid folders or structures. However, I’m not sure if this kind of app would appeal to LaTeX users, who usually write longer documents like theses or papers.

1ow76mo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ow76mo,Ultimate Little House Birthday Party Guide,"For my 30th this year, I had the pleasure of throwing a Little House party for my closest friends and it did not disappoint! After months of rewatching my favorite childhood staple I had tons of ideas and thought I’d share them with you all! I cannot stress how much fun I had putting this together, and just had to share with my fellow bonnetheads! 

Want to be as big a nerd as me? Take notes! Have yourself a Little House birthday too! 

-DECOR: 
Fabric floral pennant flags and burlap Happy Birthday Banner both from Amazon 

Chalkboard with Walnut Grove greeting (the lettering for this took me a while to figure out, but practice and do it a couple of days ahead of time and set aside!)

Miniature cut-outs, and old times ads courtesy of https://paperprairie.art.blog/ printed and shipped from Fed Ex. While they seemed daunting and complicated, after assembling the first one you become a pro. This took me two evening with about two uninterrupted hours each to complete. Double sided tape is your friend for this one!

Good old fashioned crepe paper streamers

Doilies! 

“Coffee Charles?” Screengrab that I cut out and taped to the coffee machine. Just couldn’t pass up a joke about the obscene amount of times coffee is offered on the show.

Fresh flowers from Safeway (I bought several cheap bunches and arranged them myself, and enjoyed them for at least a week after the party too!)

Hurricane lantern purchased at Walmart of all places

Little house books scattered throughout, fortunately we had my childhood set handy.

I also gathered anything from my everyday furnishings that could qualify as old timey or prairie. Luckily for me this is already pretty on brand for me, so I had a lot of odd and ends such as the serving platter, nice mason jars, etc. most of which I have thrifted over the years. Get creative, use what you already have and thrift what you don’t, it’s so fun to search for new pieces. 

-FOOD:
I am food obsessed. I had originally planned to make Almonzo’s cinnamon chicken, but became pressed for time, so I resorted to…

Costco Rotisserie chicken (bought the day before, carved, but into a buffet tray and warmed during the party)

Pot roast (prepared the day before and put into a buffet tray to be warmed during the party)

Mashed potatoes and gravy

Fresh sautéed green beans

Green salad

Corn bread (NY Times Cast Iron Skillet Cornbread)

Biscuits (James Beard recipe; Beard on Bread. This recipe will never betray you, it’s the GOAT)

Pie! My sister is amazing and made heavenly apple pie, and Marion berry rhubarb pies

All served on metal pie tins from Walmart to really get that pioneer vibe. Now I have an endless supply of pie tins I can use for pies or plates to go for guests!

Of course, veggie tray, chips, etc. for appetizers. 

-ATTIRE:
I got my dress off of Amazon, which had a wide selection of pioneer costumes. Several other guests got their outfits from Amazon, but most pieced together flannel, suspenders, and thrifted bits. 

-GOODIE BAGS:
This part was SO fun. Putting them together had me in stitches. The bags are just brown lunch bags. I bought a silicone stamp and letters to make the Oleson’s logo. The jokes and paper labels were made with the help of my classroom-style paper cutter. If you’re craft and don’t have one of these yet, upgrade your life!

A special occasion orange, cuties (not pictured)

Peppermints, like the Ingalls girls received at Christmas.

Hershey “Gold Nuggets” because you struck gold!

A whole penny of your very own!

A lemon verbena scent sachet, bought in a pack on Amazon. Lemon verbena party favors were surprisingly difficult to find.

A plastic farm animal (from a pack on Amazon) stuck to a piece of paper citing the animal’s name and which season/episode they first appeared in or were first referenced by name. I didn’t cite them unfortunately, but if you’re looking for this info DM me and I will write down what I remember, or it took me about an hour of googling/research and prep.

A joke! Once I started thinking of these I couldn’t stop. Here they are in all their cheesy, morbid glory;

1) What do you call the oldest Oleson child when she’s in a bad mood? A negative Nellie!

2) What is Charlie’s favorite midnight snack? Pa-pcorn!

3) What happens when Baby Rose has too much sugar? She’s a little Wilder!

4) What do you get when you mix Sesame Street and Little House? A Walnut Grover!

5) What did they call Caroline after she won first place  in baking at the county fair? A real pie-oneer!

6) What do you call someone dressed as Charles Ingalls? An im-pa-ster!

7) What does Mr.Edwards do for his daughter at bedtime? He Old Dan Tucks-her in!

8) What did Reverend Alden say at Sunday service? “I hope you’re feeling prairie!”

9) What did Ma tell her youngest daughter when everything was going wrong? To keep calm and Carrie on!

10) What kind of wagon did Johnny Cash drive when he played a grifting preacher on Little House? A Con-estoga!

5) How does Mr.Edwards like his potatoes? Victor French Fried! 

6) What did Pa say to Albert when Albert’s drug problem was revealed? “Albert, you’re morphine into an addict!” 

7) What is Adam Sims’ favorite kind of bug? An Eva Beadle!

8) What does Ms.Beadle say when one of her students states the obvious? “Lemon verben-DUH!”

9) What’s Mary’s favorite type of window treatment? Blinds!

10) What do you say when Pa’s plane comes in? Michael’s Landon!

11) What was Alice Garvey’s worst subject in school? Fire drills!

12) What is Doctor Baker’s favorite ailment to treat? A Bread-ache!

1ow7654,https://www.reddit.com/r/KDramasWorld/comments/1ow7654/kdrama_review_something_in_the_rain_2018_an/,"KDrama Review: Something in the rain (2018) - An experimental, yet beautifully crafted love story full of hearts","Today, I'm going to review 'Something in the Rain' (2018). Although I had completed the series last week and had also done a review (which got released very late & hence got low views), I still decided to do this review after a lot of thought. So, let's get started without further delay:

K-dramas and romance - these two words are enough to attract a person's attention and make him/her engage for a whole. There have been many great romantic k-dramas released over the years: some stayed in the hearts of viewers; some made them cry, and some made them feel depressed and anxious long after the ending. From the peak romance of **'Crash Landing on You'**(2019), to the heartbreaking trauma of '**Uncontrollably Fond**'(2016) and to the OG **Coffee Prince (2007)**, we have seen more of romance full of purity in love from these dramas than an American drama or an Indian drama. However, there is one drama that literally created buzz on its release but has been under the radar for quite a while. It's '**Something in the rain**' (2018) and from this post, I want to request you all to try this because, even if it is not ranked higher or suggested, there is beauty in this drama that you would not want to miss.

Released in 2018, '**Something in the rain**' is a drama of two people of differences - both in age and family life - who fall in love. Heard before? Yes. So, what's new? Nothing. It just reinvigorates the true meaning of love and gives a new dimension to age-gap romance, which was explored very rarely (I'm not talking about **Goblin**, that's another level). There is poetry in the form of love between the lead couple, which has the ability to melt anybody's heart. There are also two side stories-tension within FL's family about the relationship and the sexual harassment cases in the company where FL works- that keeps the drama very much engaging. The makers have done a very good job in ensuring the balance between all the stories while maintaining the main essence of this drama. TBH, I'm very much impressed with the way it makes the viewer relate with real-life struggles in love.

In terms of cast performance, this drama hits it right into the slot. Son Ye-Jin and **Jung Hae-In**, as **Yoo-Jin Ah** and **Seo Joon-Hee** (that's what was written in subtitles), were completely mesmerizing as a couple. Romance only works when the chemistry between the leads work, and both of them not only perfected their chemistry, their romance was so real that for once I thought that they had also in fallen in love off the set (no pun intended). The love and respect they showed for each other, the struggles they faced in their relationship - everything looked real and not half-baked, which showed that sometimes, age-gap romance works. This drama proved to be a boon for both **Son Ye-Jin**, who experienced a resurgence in her golden career, and **Jung Hae-In**, who literally improved his skills from **'While you were sleeping**'(2017) and continued to star in hit dramas as a lead. The supporting cast, led by the experienced **Jang So Yeon**, were outstanding for most of the time, but they sometimes got overboard in terms of reacting to certain situations, which looked weird. Still, no issues in the acting department.

The OST is pretty much laid back, as only the title track of this drama and some of background music sounded good. But I had more expectations. The cinematography is, however, very much real and at times, beautiful to watch. The way the scenes were filmed, it was like watching all these scenes live.

Overall, it's **9/10** for me. Except some of the overdramatic workplace scenes and the fact that it could have been a 20-episode drama to flesh out the story even further, I think it's an excellent good drama to watch with your partner.

1ow75v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1ow75v5/random_cpu_temperature_spikes_after_installing/,Random CPU temperature spikes after installing new Windows/changing settings in BIOS,"Hi,  
I’ll keep it short.  
In mid-October, I upgraded from Windows 10 to Windows 11. Everything seemed to be working fine, at least as far as I could tell.  
At the beginning of November, I tried to enable Secure Boot in the BIOS so I could play the new Battlefield. I didn’t manage to do it. The BIOS stopped detecting my drives, including the one with Windows installed. I restored the BIOS default settings, and the system booted up again.  
Since then, I’ve noticed that my CPU has been getting very hot, apparently for no reason. The temperature suddenly spikes to around 85°C, stays there for a while, and then goes back to normal (around 45–50°C). These spikes occur while browsing the web, but also sometimes when the computer is idle—just randomly.  
I’ve tried to figure out which process might be causing such CPU usage spikes, but I haven’t been able to determine it clearly. Is there any way to diagnose and fix this issue?  
I’m considering going back to Windows 10 completely, after formatting the system drive, but I’m not sure if it’s worth it.

Best regards,

After launching Baldur's Gate 3, just for performance check, my CPU temp went up to 96°C, am I doomed?

1ow75op,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeLovers/comments/1ow75op/coffee_bean_tracking_app_brewly/,Coffee Bean Tracking App - Brewly,"Hey everyone, I built a small side project called Brewly because I wanted an easy, visual way to log and rate the coffee beans I try. Just posting here to see if anyone is interested in playing around with the app.

It’s not meant to be anything commercial, just something for people who like tracking what they’re drinking. I'm not a software engineer but I love to tinker and honestly spent *way* too much time figuring out how to get the keyboard to push up the input fields so they don't overlap 😅

There were some cool solutions out there, but I really started getting into coffee bag art/designs and also wanted to ensuring I was showcasing some of the cool roasters I found. Current functionality includes:

1. **Log** \- this is where you can log a new bag of beans or a cup of coffee (from your beans or elsewhere). I ultimately worked on the ability to log beans, but realized we should add cup functionality as well, although I don't really find that as exciting to log each cup you have, but who knows! There's some basic AI scanning where you can take a photo of the beans and it tries to extract details. You can choose to log all your beans and rate them later, or log and rate at the same time. I also preloaded about 2K roasters and am working on getting descriptions and photos for everything --- after all, I wanted this to look aesthetically pleasing!
2. **Feed** \- Think of this like the legacy Venmo feed. Really just shows all activity that's happening in the app. People logging/rating new beans or cups. There's a follower section where you can see what's happening with your friends or people you follow. You can like and comment on feed entries.
3. **Discover** \- The last module I created when I realized there really should be more of a discovery option. This is meant to allow you to see the top rated roasters from the community and the beans. There's also a top cups section here as well. Again, I didn't spend a ton of time on this because I just assumed it wouldn't be used as much. It also allows you to search for any of the roasters in our database. I am constantly adding new ones!
4. **Library** \- This is where all your logged beans and cups live. You have a record of all your logged beans and cups. You can change your ratings or edit the details. You also can indicate if the beans are in-stock or not.

That's basically it. Again, if there's interest to play around, I'd be happy to listen to your feedback and see how I can incorporate.

Kirk tries to eat lunch and ends up wrestling with a furry infestation. When he discovers tribbles sitting on his plate, he sputters:

🎥 YouTube video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2T1QX7BEyg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2T1QX7BEyg)

Tribbles get into everything: the air vents, the machinery, the storage compartments.

Kirk says: ***“I want these off the ship. I don't care if it takes every man we've got, I want them off the ship.”***

What's his problem?

Tribbles are harmless and free.

👉 Bad resumes are the same.  Harmless and free.

It's a catch-22:

1. You can’t afford to pay someone to fix your resume.
2. You don’t have the cash.
3. If you had a coding job, you’d have the cash.
4. But if you had a coding job, you wouldn’t need a good resume—you’d already be hired.

Mr. Spock would raise an eyebrow and conclude: **“Well, I cannot improve my resume. Therefore, I shall simply wait for a better job market to get a coding job.”**

Besides, a bad resume can still get you cash…

**👉 McDonald’s will hire you with a bad resume.**

So will retail.

So will call centers.

**If you go that route, congratulations! You can afford rent and food. You didn’t need to pay anyone to improve your resume. Your bad resume achieved its mission.**

As per the tradition, she picks up the bill (she refuses to let anyone - including the Queen - do so) and I leave the tip. And to be clear, I do not impose my beliefs about tipping when he go out. She believes you leave at least 10% for 'OK', 15% for good service, and anything more if you're feeling generous.

Therefore, I leave $5.00 - regardless of the service - since the totally usually comes to \~$40.00. Furthermore, this is at a chain restaurant specializing in 'healthier' breakfast items. From what I could see, there was one other table occupied when we sat down... the rest of the customers arrived after we had ordered.

The first mishap was when she received her toasted buttered after she ordered for it to be dry. The second was when she realized she never received her bacon. At this point, the bill had been settled and we were all set to leave. To her credit, the server was prompt in replacing the toast and followed up with our table after to replenish the coffee.

So in the end, the server got extra money while my mom didn't get what she ordered. Furthermore, my mom always feels conflicted when servers make mistakes in light of her thinking hard working people should be paid a decent wage. And this is in Canada, where servers earn a regular wage.

Most posts I see here are from the USA, GB, Australia, and while they are extremely helpful, I wanted to give a different point of view to people who maybe live in a country more like mine and will get their procedure done in a hospital, with overnight stay, or are just curious how it goes in a different place. 

So buckle up, I'm gonna be thorough to help ease your mind about everything I was worried about. I did not know what to expect at all, so if you are curious - this is for you.

\---

**My ""story"" and price**

Firstly - yay! I F(29)(child-free) got sterilized on 11/11, and I still can't fully believe it. I always knew I did not want children, but it never really occurred to me that I could get a procedure like this done, or would be brave enough to go ""under a knife"". 

I started researching more a few years ago, could not really afford it as some places started at 500 euro. But this year I finally had enough saved up and actually ended up very lucky, because I found a hospital where, even as I paid for it all myself, it was **200 euro** (sorry to everyone who has to pay like 6k, it truly is crazy over there).

Also, not sure if it is necessary for me to say this, but I remember seeing people ask why the man does not get a vasectomy. Yes, I have a male partner, but this is my body and I do not wish to get pregnant - with anyone. Especially with how the world is, I wanted to protect myself from being forced to. My partner (well, fiancée, but the word is funny to me) is amazing and has been taking the best care of me our whole relationship (10 years) and supported me through this whole journey. I am a very lucky woman to have him.

I was also lucky in that none of the doctors along the way tried stopping me. 

**Getting the appointment**

I first went to my gyno, an older gentleman, and when I said I wanted to consult a sterilization he said *""You must be very disappointed in men to make such a decision.""* It was lighthearted, and I do not think of it as rude or negative. I simply laughed and just explained myself a little. Turns out I did not need his approval, as the bisalp was not medically needed, but still wanted it in my file that I went for a consultation.

Then I went to the hospital, where the female doctor expressed, rather sadly, that I was young and healthy, but it was my decision in the end. I understand that these people help bring babies into this world every day, but I am grateful the doctor kept most of her thoughts to herself and respected me.

**Pre-op**

So I signed the papers in September and was scheduled for 20th of October. Sadly, I got sick and they rescheduled. If you are still preparing for your procedure, do your best to stay away from sick people, especially during flu season. I did take vitamins prior to my 2nd date but stopped a week prior, as some supplements may affect bleeding and such. **So make sure you ask your doctor.**

I also had to attend a pre-op examination by my GP (blood work, ECG) and an examination by an anaesthesiologist. I am otherwise healthy, so there were no issues.

I was stressed out the whole time I waited, because as many others, the only other medical work I had had done before was getting my wisdom teeth removed, and even then I had been awake and under local anaesthesia. 

**Disclaimer**

Please, do not expect your experience to be the same, even if you are in the same country as me. Your doctors could do things differently - that is why I also decided not to share the amount of medications they gave me. I am sharing this because of how much Reddit posts like this one helped me in preparation for my surgery, especially mentally. This is not a step-by-step for all :) 

**Hospital - day before surgery**

The 2nd date finally arrived, and I was admitted in the afternoon on the 10th. They drew my blood. In the evening I was given suppositories to help pass stool and after that some sleep medication that would also ease my nerves. I could not eat after 6pm and drink after midnight (this seems like a global standard).

I was surprisingly calm, even without the medication. I was just super glad to be there. All the fears left my body as I entered the hospital.

**Hospital - day of surgery**

I woke up at 5 am, took a shower and put on compression socks (up to my thighs). 

At 6am they started me on IV fluids - the IV did not hurt at all and was actually less uncomfortable than when they take your blood. There were 3 other minor surgeries before me, so I had to wait until 10am for my turn. I just rested until my time came. 

In the meantime I was also given IV antibiotics and anti-inflammatory suppositories. Then they gave me the sleep meds from the previous night, could only have a gulp of water, and I walked to the operating room.

**Hospital - the operating room (or the room before that?)**

I did not know what to expect. The first room reminded me of a weird spa. There were actually a lot of hospital staff, like 10 people walking around, maybe. A male nurse approached me and told me to strip while he covered me with a sheet, I had to put on a hair net. 

Then he walked me to another room, where maybe like 6 anaesthesiologists waited. I was surprised by how many people there were! I laid on a table with a comfy, but weird donut shaped pillow, where they strapped my arms and legs (I read that they tilt you during surgery) and then someone put the mask on. The radio was on.

It smelled weird and sweet, and for a moment I thought I'd choke, but after 3 breaths I was out.

**I am awake! Sort of...**

The first thing I remember veeery hazily is when they were transferring me to a bed. They asked me to hold on to a little holder above, but my left arm would not cooperate :D someone had to actually move my arm so I could grasp the thing. 

Then I remember that the nurses were talking in the elevator and I realized I had a dream while in surgery, so I asked whether people usually dream. One nurse answered that one lady once dreamt that she was in Mallorca. Then I was out again.

**Back in my room**

I finally fully opened my eyes back in my room, back in my nightgown and immediately reached for my phone to let my loved ones know I was okay (the hospital had forbidden visits because of flu season, so no one even could be there with me). The nurse then hooked me up with a glucose IV. The surgery took less than an hour, I was gone from my room for about an hour.

Then I slept some more, had more IV antibiotics and anti-inflammatory suppositories. I was more fully awake at around 4pm and was allowed to start drinking water. I still had a catheter in, which I actually was worried about, because I have a history of bad and frequent UTIs back from when I was a child. I was told I needed to be able to walk first before they took it out, and the lovely nurse actually let me sit up at around 5pm. 

I was sore and could feel the incisions, but I'd rate it at 4/10 period discomfort. I was hungry, and the nurse brought me a plate of the best smelling spaghetti ever.

**Some regrets...** 

I took a few small bites, because I was a bit nauseous from the drugs, then a piece of hard meat entered my mouth... I spit it out because I knew it would make me sick. But actually the act of spitting it out made me sick. The spaghetti was so delicious, but they took it away :( so that is what I regret. Not eating more of that beautiful spaghetti.

But after that I actually felt soo much better and could walk no problem immediately. I went to wash my mouth/face, had to carry the pee bag :/ But the nurse saw I was doing fine and took the catheter out. 

That was probably the most uncomfortable experience out of this whole thing. Felt like when you have a UTI, but only for a few seconds. I actually felt like I needed to pee immediately and I did! Which is a great sign after you have your catheter removed. It did sting for a few more pees.

**Info** \- if you are also worried about the catheter, the nurses told me that they do not always do them. So do not be afraid to ask or express concern.

**Sleepless night and moving around**

I was given some piškóty (sweet little biscuits) and water instead for dinner and asked for some pain meds because for a moment the pain got slightly worse, and I was afraid it would escalate. The pain meds were via IV.

The rest of the evening was super chill. I watched some YouTube, got up to pee many times and drank a lot of fluids - but slowly - and walked around my room to help with the gas. I was not too bloated, but could feel it inside me. The night nurse removed my IV and gave me gas relief tablets and pain meds (tablets). I did not plan to play a hero, so I did take them.

Because of all the day-sleeping I could not fall asleep until 3 am, so I just rested, and I tried to sit up every once in a while and sway on the bed slightly to help me burp - which it did. I also positioned the bed to be in a more sitting position and did some light pelvic movements to help pass gas - which they did. 

**Hospital - day after surgery**

I woke up at around 6am. They drew my blood one more time. Then the doctors came, asked how I felt, told me how the surgery went and that they would release me in a few hours.

I could eat a light breakfast and drink tea without feeling nauseous at probably 8, and actually had my first stool! TMI:>!wow the post-surgery poop smells, almost made me nauseous again.!<But it did not hurt at all and was easy on my wounds.

Then I was released at 9! Yay! I dressed myself because they released me sooner that anticipated and my partner was not there yet. But it was not very hard. I just took my sweet time. Honestly, I could have waited for him to arrive and help me, but I was SO ready to go home asap.

**Back home (24-50+ hours post-op)**

Since coming home my partner has been taking the best care of me, I've been quite hungry and able to eat without problem, as well as go to the toilet. I did buy some sports drinks (vitamin water), electrolytes and also a prebiotic & probiotic water (fermented drink). 

I have bought stool softeners and gas relief, but did not feel the need to use them yet as I pass gass without issue. I ate soup yesterday and had very light coffee this morning which always helps me go to the toilet.

I slept very well, but still propped up into a more sitting-up position.

Currently, as of writing, there is little pain, mostly when I move. There is one spot in/near my belly button that ""itches"" once a while. I did take one pain med at lunch but mostly for the back pain/discomfort.

I guess I managed to get rid of most of the gas, but the shoulder pain was truly as bad as eevryone says. Definitely recommend warm compress. 

Oh and my throat was audibly pretty messed up till today. I bought some cough drops and started using them as soon as the nurse cleared me. So also recommend.

**Incisions/wounds/other**

I have the three standard wounds, I do have stitches (will be taken out next Tuesday) and I also have 4 little needle holes around my belly button (I guess from when they took out the gas? I forgot to ask). Some people bleed and have to use pads, I have not. 

I have mild allergy to glue (like in some band-aids), but I am not sure if they simply generally use stitches here, or if they do use glue and just did not use it one me. I have something that reminds me of second-skin that tattooers use. Can't really share pics, as my wounds are also covered by white gauze, so nothing interesting.

Well, this is fairly long, hope it helps at least one person. Feel free to ask anything, even TMI stuff that I maybe forgot. I want to be open in order to help ease your worries.

Sometimes I wonder if joining CA in Nepal was big big mistake ,a slow trap. 

You start full of dreams, thinking hard work will pay off  and then you enter articleship, where you work like an full time employee literally but get paid less than a cup of coffee. You spend your days running audits, typing reports, pleasing seniors, and your nights trying to study with eyes half shut. There’s no time, no energy, and definitely no life.

Then come the exams ,the same endless loop.

One failure after another, each attempt stealing another 6 months of your life. You start to feel like a frog that jumped into a deep well thinking it was water, but it’s actually a pit with no way out. 


Friends move on with their jobs, degrees, and peace, while you’re still here  with tension, self-doubt, and a pile of unfinished dreams.

The firms are no better. Politics, favoritism, overwork, and zero appreciation. The harder you work, the more invisible you become. They’ll tell you it’s “part of the process” but nobody talks about how much this process breaks you.

you stop studying to learn. You just study to pass. And that’s the scariest part  when passion dies and you still keep going because you’re too deep to climb out.

1.      Suppose I start here: I think I loved a secret more than I loved the boy who kept it. Or maybe the secret *was* the boy. Is that too simple? Suppose I admit this necklace – green, dense, faintly humming—became the locus of that confusion. Worn right here, between the collarbones. A bruise made permanent.

2.      Saw a science program once. Some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds formed through interstellar collisions. Imagine. Beauty born from celestial violence.

3.      I trace the edge with my nail. Again. A nervous habit, maybe Its resilience reminds me of certain silences.  The mineral stubbornness pressing lines into my skin.

4.      His earnestness, a fragile shield against… what? Did we even know then? Just boys and girls playing dress-up with emotions too big for us. The necklace felt like part of that costume; a necessary ballast.

5.      I can remember pressing it hard against my skin often. Feeling the coolness, then the warmth leaching from my own body into the stone. What was I trying to do? Absorb it? Understand it by touch? A small, stupid ritual against the larger unknowns.

6.      Reading mother’s diary felt like this, too. Pressing my face against the page, trying to inhale her handwriting. Was I trying to *be* her? Or just prove I existed outside the shadow of the crash? The necklace, fragment of that same fire, felt like evidence. Exhibit A: Girl Tethered to Tragedy. Its green glow, a sickly nightlight against the darkness of her absence.

7.      He smelled of sun and hay and something else. Something electric, unsettling. Like the air before a storm. *This time, Lana.* His eyes would plead. My pulse, a trapped bird against the stone.

8.      Suppose I admit it: my primary orientation is towards a piece of rock. I love blue, but the world seems to be saturated with green. A point of cold pressure just below my throat. Sometimes I forget it's there, until I shift wrong, or the chain catches—a sharp pull against the ordinary fabric of the day. An inescapable weight.

9.       I read that Meteorites carry traces of amino acids. Building blocks of life. Here, they brought death. And this fragment I wore? It seemed to carry the echo of their love. A building block of distance. Is that life?

10.  Performance becomes second nature in a town like Smallville. The Smile. The Tilt of the Head. The Appropriate Level of Grief. The Necklace was part of that uniform. I remember catching its reflection in the window of the Talon, superimposed over my own face. Which was the mask?

11.   She catches me touching the stone again. A flicker in her stare—not judgment, just… always noticing. My thumb hides the green. But she’s already turning away. What did she see? A souvenir, or the scar; maybe just the chaotic green I wear.

12.   Are the hinges of my apartment made of glass?  The coffee shop was supposed to be a serene space. It’s more like diorama of my entrapment: I’m like both prisoner and exhibit, serving lattes in a cage dressed as a Nilotic sanctuary.

13.  A tiny luminous screen next to his hospital bed. Isn’t it strange? That jagged green line holding something immeasurably vast in implication. It becomes a part of your body—tracing the contours of your heartbeat. A diminutive, little protector; a beacon displaying your disrepair.

14.  Is it possible to get used to poison? A low dose, every day, until your body doesn't register the sickness, just the constant unease. Until the green glow feels like normal light.

15.  What do you do when the person you love causes you physical pain, just by being near what defines *you*?

16.  Paris had soft light. Grey stone that absorbed sound. Stood before Monet’s Nymphéas for an hour. All that blue felt like a different planet. Could barely remember the colour green. A lie, of course. You never forget the feel of the cage.

17.  Took it off. Placed it in a cedar box my aunt had made years ago. The sudden lightness felt wrong. Like an amputation.

18.  Is it a sin to crave the texture of truth? Even if it's cold, sharp-edged? This stone doesn’t lie. Its green simply *is*. Unlike the shifting landscapes in people’s eyes, the careful architecture of their smiles. This weight, at least, feels constant. But maybe that’s the biggest lie of all—mistaking mineral silence for honesty. My own pathetic fallacy.

19.  People talk about scars fading. Does embedded radiation fade? Or does it just become part of your cellular makeup, indistinguishable from the self? You carry the source within. Removal doesn't guarantee decontamination.

20.  From the sky-fire that took them. My parents. And I wear it. Daily. Is this piety, or a kind of morbid map-making? An attempt to trace the coordinates of absence, right here, against my own skin.

21.  The Cafe. My messy, imperfect try at something real. Coffee grounds on the floor, the clatter of mugs. Then he would walk in, and the air would thicken. The green stone, even tucked under my shirt, felt suddenly loud. A tuning fork for his evasions. He'd promise. *This time, Lana.* And the stone felt like a lie detector against my own pulse. Steady, knowing beat: *No.*

22.  Is memory just choosing which bruises to press on? Over and over...or am I? This one is—cool and green; perpetually tender.

23.  He once gave me a rare orchid. Perfect, waxy petals. Unreal. He said its particular shade reminded him of my eyes. I think it reminded him of the necklace. Something beautiful, cultivated, and containable. Something he could eventually own.

24.  I confess I have built a life around a piece of green stone. A shard collected from the wreckage. It rests against my sternum now, always cool. They say remember the those we lost.  Suppose I admitted that some days, the coldness of it feels less like memory, more like the core of the loneliness itself.

25.  The feeling of the chain, thin against the skin on my neck. Sometimes catching a strand of hair. A tiny, persistent irritation. A reminder.

26.  Sometimes, it’s just green. Dull jade in the shade. Other times, caught in a certain light, it seems to pulse. A faint, unhealthy viridescence leaking out. Like poison trying to pass as jewel. Like a secret held so tight it glows.

27.  Do memories attach themselves to objects? Or do objects become anchors for the storm inside? Pressing the cool green stone against my temple. Trying to still the thoughts. A futile exercise. Like trying to map fog.

28.  Authenticity? Tried to find it in textbooks, in relationships, in independence. Is it something you find? Or something you are granted?

29.  That hard, phosphorescent green. The color of this rock, yes. But also oscilloscope screens. Digital rain in *The Matrix*. An unnatural energy. A signal from somewhere else, disrupting everything.

30.  He arrived with answers. Not truths, perhaps, but answers. Plausible surfaces. Explanations like smooth, cool stones skipping over the murky depths Clark navigated. Lex didn’t carry a secret like a burden; he wielded secrets like tools. Or weapons.

31.  Hold it up to the window on a rainy day. Does stone absorb sorrow? It just refracts the gray light, dense and mute. I read somewhere about rocks holding magnetic memory. Perhaps this piece remembers the fire, the speed, the impact. Maybe I touch it hoping for transmission. A jolt of clarity. Am I simply assigning narrative weight to a random piece of cosmic debris?

32.  Does the green fade? Or just seep deeper into the bloodstream? Still waiting for an answer.

33.  That necklace, that small green thing, made his proximity agony. Think about that. Love as proximity-induced pain. The green glow, the color of an impossible equation.

34.  A snag. The chain catches on the wool of my sweater. Just a tiny, routine friction. And suddenly: the linoleum floor of the hospital, the smell of antiseptic, the sticky green soap in the dispenser. *That* green. This stone didn't create the feeling, it just gave it a locus. Something tangible to wear around my neck, a portable memento of the moment the world cracked.

35.  To find oneself irrevocably altered. Choiceless. Defined by an event, carrying its physical remnant. Its muteness. That is the point, perhaps. A constant, quiet assertion of the rupture. Maybe this uncomfortable persistence is the closest thing to truth I possess.

36.  My fingers find it without thinking. Stress, uncertainty, a sudden chill—the familiar smooth shape; the outline of its mineral stubbornness.

37.  How to describe this control? Not chains. More like… altering the magnetic poles. So all your compasses point toward him. Even your own body, a traitor collaborating with the narrative he spun. Phantom life. Sickeningly precise.

38.  His pain. A physical thing. A barrier woven into the fabric of the town, the air, the necklace. My closeness was agony for him. Love measured in excruciating proximity. Green was the color of that impossible space between us.

39.  What is this compulsion to touch it? Trace its edges until my fingerprint smudges its surface? Not like wanting Clark, the heat of that. No. This is different. A desperate, almost geological curiosity. What would happen if I put it in my mouth? Let the cold strangeness dissolve on my tongue? The *wanting* is there- Is it a strange thought? To integrate it somehow. To understand its alien indifference from the inside out.

40.  To want truth so badly you’d tear the world apart for it. Then realize you might be tearing yourself apart instead.

41.  Trust erodes like sandstone. Faster here. Each lie, each evasion, not a hammer blow, but water dripping. Persistent. Inescapable. You wake up one day and the foundation is just… gone. Replaced by suspicion. That hard, watchful green.

42.  Is it perverse to think I’d miss the weight of it now? The certainty of that specific pain? At least it was a map. A known territory of hurt.

43.  He made the lies physical, undeniable. Cellular. Suddenly the necklace seemed like a childish token. A surface secret. Lex dealt in biological truths, rewritten realities. His deception wasn't a weight; it was an infection. The green I wore felt clean compared to that invisible violation.

44.  I took it off. Put it in a box. Felt like burying a part of myself. The part that waited. The part that believed, maybe, that truth was graspable, solid like stone. It’s more like a tear now than jade stone.

45.  Loneliness can make you mistake comfort for control. The sound I mistook as safety; no, just the sound of a cell door closing softly.

46.  Heavier than stone, the weight of what it represented. The unsaid. The perpetually deferred truth. You get used to carrying it, adjust your posture. Until one day you try to stand straight without it and find you’ve forgotten how.

47.  Am I just cataloging grievances? Polishing the stone of my own hurt? Perhaps. But understanding the shape of the cage is the first step, isn't it? Even if you can't find the key.

48.  Sometimes, I dream in green. Not the soft green of new leaves. The hard, phosphorescent green of trapped energy. Of things that fell from a great height and shattered everything. It doesn't fade. That color. It just finds new surfaces to stain.



  
the poem’s core psychological mechanism—a unique literary device driving the narrative. Its fragmented, associative structure mimics the looping, often confusing nature of trauma and memory, immersing the reader directly into Lana's internal state. Instead of just describing her pain or confusion, the poem enacts it through this structure, with each vignette orbiting the paradoxical necklace that both comforts and wounds. This structural choice, combined with the intimate, questioning first-person voice, creates a l sense of lived experience. It fuses form and content, using the necklace and the poem’s structure as an active entanglement engine to build a haunting and psychologically resonant portrayal of being trapped, making the reader feel the inescapable weight of her experience. she circles the stone, the stone circles her pain, and the poem circles itself.  
the necklace is a thematic black hole. Its gravity is so immense that anything you bring near it—Paris, Lex's control, a childhood memory, the smell of hay—is immediately pulled into its orbit and forced to relate to it.

I apologized and said I was just focused on getting settled.

Hi everyone,

I'm a 29-year-old professional based in Delhi, and I'm hoping to connect with a kind, thoughtful woman for meaningful companionship. Whether it's exploring the city's hidden gems, sharing good conversations over coffee, or just enjoying quiet moments together, I'm open to seeing where things go.

A bit about me: I enjoy books, music, long walks, and trying out new cuisines. I'm emotionally mature, respectful, and value genuine connections. Ideally, I'm looking to meet someone  who shares similar interests and is open to building a friendship that could grow into something deeper.

If this resonates with you, feel free to drop me a message. Let's see if we vibe!",2,1763054383.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

She seemed really nice and invested, even hearted some of my messages and all. We exchanged Discord because we're both gamers and chatted a bit more. 

We were up really late and texted a lot and the day after I decided to just ask her out on a coffee to chat irl. She told me that she's been feeling really down lately and can't bring herself to go outside except for university, but she'd love to meet in 1-2 Weeks. 

I just told her that it's okay and she shouldn't worry about it, that the offer isn't running away and just told her we can just text until she's feeling better. 

And since then poof. She stopped texting. Everytime I open the damn app to play with my friends I can see that she's online all day and just never texted.

I'm just so confused right now, it's been almost 3 days and I'm not sure anymore if her last message was just a very weird rejection or what. Do I check in on her? Or do I just say it's over and move on?",2,1763054306.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False
1ow6x4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Bts-skzfanfiction/comments/1ow6x4x/chapter_from_the_book_on_wattpad/,Chapter from the book on wattpad,"The midday sun beat down on the quiet streets of the city, turning the air thick and stagnant. Bang Chan, 28 and built like a wall of muscle from years on the force, slouched in the driver's seat of his patrol car, parked curbside near the park. His uniform—crisp blue shirt straining over his broad chest, pants hugging his thick thighs—felt suffocating in the boredom. No calls, no action; just the hum of the AC and his mind wandering to the gym later. His shift stretched another four hours, and he drummed his fingers on the wheel, jaw set in frustration.

A sharp knock on the window jolted him. He rolled it down, facing a young woman in her mid-20s, her eyes wide with panic, tears streaking her flushed cheeks. She was stunning even in distress—soft features, full lips, curves hugged by a simple sundress that ended mid-thigh. 'Officer, please! My dog—she's run off, and I can't find her anywhere. She's just a little fluff ball, she'll get hurt!' Her voice cracked, hands twisting together.

Chan straightened, his protective instincts kicking in. 'Hey, easy. What's her name? Describe her.' Yn spilled the details—a small white Pomeranian named Luna—and he radioed it in before stepping out. They searched on foot for an hour, weaving through alleys and calling her name, Yn's sobs quieting as hope flickered.

Then, a yip from the busy road ahead. Luna darted into traffic, cars honking wildly. Yn screamed, 'Luna!' Chan didn't hesitate; he sprinted across, dodging a sedan, and scooped the trembling dog into his arms just as another vehicle swerved. Heart pounding, he jogged back, handing the squirming pup over. Yn clutched Luna to her chest, tears flowing anew. 'Thank you, thank you so much! I don't know what I'd do without her.' She hugged him impulsively, her body soft against his, and he patted her back awkwardly, a spark of warmth cutting through the adrenaline.

Three days later, Chan sat in a corner booth at the local cafe, nursing a black coffee during his break. The bell jingled, and in walked Yn, spotting him immediately. Her smile lit up the room as she approached, Luna's leash in hand. 'Officer Chan? I just wanted to thank you again. You saved her life.' He grinned, gesturing to the seat opposite. 'Call me Bang. Sit—join me. Break's not over yet.' She slid in, ordering a latte, and they talked effortlessly. She was a graphic designer, loved animals, lived alone nearby. He shared cop stories, careful ones, his deep voice drawing her in.

Laughter flowed, but so did glances—his eyes lingering on the way her dress dipped at her cleavage, her gaze tracing the veins in his forearms. Heat simmered under the surface, ignored at first as they chatted about favorite movies. But the air thickened; her foot brushed his under the table accidentally, lingering. Chan's cock twitched in his pants, and he shifted, clearing his throat. Yn's cheeks pinked, biting her lip.

She checked her watch. 'Oh, I should head home—work calls.' Chan stood. 'Let me drive you. Police escort, on the house.' She agreed, eyes sparkling with unspoken want.

In the patrol car, the tension coiled tighter. Her scent—sweet vanilla—filled the space, her thigh inches from his as he drove. Small talk faded; silence hummed with electricity. At her apartment complex, he parked, engine off. Neither moved. Their eyes locked, breaths syncing.

The snap came fast. Chan cupped her face, pulling her across the console for a deep kiss—lips crashing, tongues tangling hungrily. She moaned into his mouth, hands fisting his shirt. 'Backseat,' he growled, breaking away. They scrambled over, doors locked, windows tinted.

Clothes flew—his uniform shirt unbuttoned, revealing ripped abs and a trail of dark hair leading down. Yn's dress hiked up, then off, leaving her in lacy panties and bra, full breasts spilling over. He yanked her bra down, sucking a nipple hard while she palmed his bulge through his pants. 'Fuck, I need you,' he rasped, unzipping to free his thick cock—long and girthy, veins pulsing, head already leaking.

Yn's eyes widened with lust, dropping to her knees on the seat. She wrapped her hand around his shaft, stroking once before leaning in, lips parting to take the head into her warm mouth. She sucked greedily, tongue swirling the slit, hollowing her cheeks as she bobbed, taking more with each pass. Saliva dripped down his length, her hand pumping what she couldn't swallow. Chan groaned, fingers threading her hair, thrusting shallowly. 'That's it, suck my cock like you mean it.' She gagged softly on a deeper push but kept going, eyes watering, throat relaxing to take him deeper.

After minutes of her sloppy blowjob, he pulled her off, lips shiny. 'My turn.' He shoved her back, ripping her panties aside to expose her soaked pussy—pink folds glistening, clit swollen. Chan dove in, broad shoulders pinning her thighs wide. His tongue lapped her slit roughly, flat strokes from entrance to clit, then sucking the nub hard between his lips. Yn arched, crying out, fingers clawing his scalp. He plunged two fingers inside her tight heat, curling to hit her G-spot while his mouth devoured her, teeth grazing her inner thighs. 'So fucking wet for me,' he muttered against her, vibrations making her buck. He ate her out relentlessly, fingers pumping fast, until she shattered, pussy clenching as she came on his tongue, juices flooding his mouth.

Panting, he rose, wiping his chin. 'Spread for me.' Yn lay back on the seat, legs splayed, pulling him over her. His cock nudged her entrance, slick with her arousal. No words on protection—just raw need. He thrust in hard, burying to the hilt in one go, her walls stretching around his girth. She gasped, nails raking his back. 'Fuck, you're tight.' Chan pounded into her desperately, hips snapping, balls slapping her ass with each brutal drive. The car rocked, seats creaking under their frenzy.

Yn wrapped her legs around him, meeting his thrusts, moans filling the air. 'Harder—fuck me harder!' He obliged, angling to slam her cervix, one hand pinning her wrists above her head, the other rubbing her clit. Sweat slicked their bodies, his cock dragging her walls with every withdraw and plunge. Tension built fast; she clenched, orgasming again, milking him. 'Shit—gonna cum inside you,' he grunted, unable to stop. With a roar, he buried deep, cock pulsing as ropes of hot cum flooded her pussy, filling her to overflowing.

They collapsed, breaths ragged, his weight comforting. Cum leaked from her as he softened inside, but neither cared—the city outside oblivious to the heat they'd unleashed.

Even when I try to connect on why they liked something vs just what, it starts to feel like an one-sided interview.  
  
Sometimes, I'll suggest something specific, like checking out a cafe since we both like coffee and pastries. They will say, 'looks cool! that they may check it out alone' and then disappear. 

I'll see people making plans to meet up with other people in the groups feature of the app. I don't get it. I'm making small talk. I'm suggesting plans. Neither seem to work for me. I know that 'how did your weekend go? how are you?' are usually dead-end topics but idk how else to open.

Oh, how nice.  
Candles lighting.  
Wintertime.

1ow6u5c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEKj9fsxw80,Does grind size matter? I wanted to know so I ran an experiment and made a YT video on it,"So a while ago I got into making coffee and if you know anything about making a brew the grind size is really important. It got me thinking about if the grind size of the bud I use also matters and I decided to make a YouTube video on it as I don't really see other weed YouTubers doing this sort of thing

I'm basically copying James Hoffmann but replacing the coffee with bud. It's way too long but it's my 1st one so hopefully I get better and make more concise videos in future

If there are any suggestions they are welcomed. Also, if people have ideas for other experiments they want to see then I'm all ears",2,1763054103.0,CincyCannabis,1,1.0,False

I started losing time. Long stretches of time.

I first noticed  them acting weird at a party. 

The party was nothing special, really. 

I didn’t drink that much that night. 

The point is, I can’t blame what I saw on being drunk.

I know perception can be misinterpreted and messed up when you’ve had one too many canned Strawberry Daiquiris, but I was completely sober.

And I was planning on staying that way until we left.

I remember the night in clarity. I’m not a fan of crowds, so I lingered in Abigail’s kitchen playing around on my phone.

I only knew Abigail Matheson from Rowan and Immie. They were in the same classes.

I needed to find something to occupy my mind or I was going to die of boredom.

Most of the party was in the living room playing Mario Kart, and I was refilling my glass when I glimpsed Immie’s familiar blonde ponytail bouncing through straggling students grinding against each other.

The party wasn’t costume-themed, but Immie insisted on wearing a baby blue ribbon in her hair, which reminded me of a grown Disney character.

Imogen Prairie was the human embodiment of a golden retriever.

She is as adorable as she is naïve and is always smiling no matter the situation.

I lifted my drink in greeting, about to shout her name, but then I saw the expression on her face.

She looked… wary.

No, that’s not the word. 

I can’t describe her expression because I couldn’t understand it myself. 

For once, Imogen wasn’t smiling. Her eyes were wide, lips twitching into a scowl.

Her movements were erratic as she headed into the kitchen, grabbing a glass of punch and downing it before striding towards the back window and pulling the blinds shut.

Rowan, roommate number two, was right behind her.

They were talking in hushed whispers, their heads pressed together before Rowan noticed me.

Rowan was what you would call pretentious cute.

Usually dressed in trench coats, his party outfit was oddly normal.

Shirt and jeans, a loose pair of glasses sitting on top of unruly brown curls.

Rowan Beck resembled what *he* called a ‘normie’.

He fixed me with what I can only describe as a patient smile. “Nin! Have you seen Kaz?”

The copious amounts of lemonade I’d been drinking all night started to crawl back up my throat.

His tone was different. Darker. Nothing like I knew.

That was the first night I noticed something was wrong with him.

“Huh?” I said stupidly. “Kaz?”

Rowan raised a brow. “Yep. Kazzzz.” He dragged out the Z. “The guy you *live* with. Have you seen him anywhere?”

“I don't think so.” I caught his sharp glance at the blinds. “Rowan, are you… okay?”

The man's gaze snapped to me. 

“I'm peachy.”

Rowan leaned against the table, his expression darkening. I sensed the desperation emitting from him, but it didn’t make sense. Was Kaz in trouble? 

And why were they keeping it between them? What were we, little kids? 

His expression was sour, like he couldn't bear talking to me. “Did Kaz by any chance… I don't know,” he tapped out a tune on the countertop. “Mayyyybeee go outside?”

Our third roomie had been MIA since the four of us walked in earlier. 

He made a comment about going to talk to a guy he was crushing on before disappearing into the crowd. 

I hadn’t seen him since. Which was very unlike Kaz. 

When it comes to games, or anything playable, he’s a competitive bastard. 

I expected him to be in the living room with the others, slamming buttons like his life depended on it. Instead, he was nowhere to be seen. 

I opened my mouth to speak, when Immie stuck her head through the gap in the door. 

“He’s fine!” Immie said, a streak of panic in her tone. She shooed me back when I started forwards. “We’ve got this. Kaz is just, uh, well, he's doing Kaz stuff.”

“Kaz *stuff*?”

“Yeah!” Imogen’s smile was a little too big. “Like I said, we’ve got this.”

“Have we?” Rowan snapped. He raked his fingernails down his face. “How do you lose a 23 year old guy?”

“You forget to cherish him,” Imogen teased, shooting him a grin. 

Rowan’s eyes narrowed. “Take this seriously.”

Immie scowled, throwing a cup in his face. 

“He told me he was going to the bathroom.” She said, “It’s not like I could follow him.”

Rowan tossed a cup right back at her. “In these circumstances, yes, you should have followed him!” Lowering his voice, Rowan pulled her closer. But I still heard him. 

“He could *drown!* What did I tell you about keeping the idiot away from the pool?” 

Imogen scoffed. “I'm sorry, how is that fair? Why don't *you* babysit?”

“You offered.”

“Yeah, not for the whole night!”

Their argument was barely registering. 

*Drown?*

“Nin. You stay here.” Immie grabbed a reluctant Rowan’s arm.  “We’ll go get him.”

I nodded with a smile, but that didn’t stop me following them. 

I made it to the front door, almost tripping over myself. 

The party continued behind me, laughter, and giddy screaming from the living room. 

In front of me, however, was something entirely different from the party. 

The front door was wide open, and the night sky bled inside the house. 

My three roommates  stood on the threshold, their heads tipped back, eyes on the night sky, and the full moon bathing the dark in unearthly light. 

I’ve looked this phenomenon up, and it can be called “Moon drunk” but this had never happened before. I had lived with them for two years and this was the first time they were entranced by the fucking moon of all things. 

Kaz was in front of the others, and I glimpsed a can of beer at his feet spilling its contents onto rough concrete.

At first, I thought they were marvelling the sight. I mean, it was beautiful enough to stare at and smile, maybe comment on it or take a photo. 

""Hey."" I clapped my hands in Rowan's face. ""What's going on?"" 

He didn't even blink. 

Moving to Immie and Kaz, I shook them. 

Still nothing. 

They did move… eventually. 

“See.” Rowan’s voice was almost a breath, his gaze still on the sky. “We’ve found him.”

When the music stopped, they came back to life, ignoring me, and bound back into the party with no explanation to what the hell had just happened.

“Moon drunk” was starting to make the most sense.  

I got my answer when I went back inside, and Kaz was raiding the refrigerator. 

I didn’t think much of it until I saw pieces of raw bacon squelching between his fingers and stringy white sticking from his mouth. 

Now, there’s getting the munchies, and there’s willingly stuffing yourself with raw bacon. 

“Kaz?”

The boy twisted around so fast, almost inhuman. 

Kaz slowly inclined his head, bacon fat caught between his teeth. 

There was a feral look in his eyes, which told me if I even attempted to stop him from feasting on raw pork, I’d lose a finger.  

His gaze tracked me like a predator, before turning back to his meal. 

I left him to whatever *that* was. 

Immie, who hadn’t paid attention to a guy since freshman year when she was assaulted at a party, was sitting in a random guy’s lap, her lips latched to his ear. 

It was Immie who looked to be the one in control, but even being moon drunk, I didn’t want her anywhere near a guy. 

Not when she was still in therapy. 

Before I could intervene, my housemate was yanking the guy to his feet in one pull and dragging him upstairs.

To my shock, though, it was the guy who pulled away from her. “What the fuck?” He hissed, “Get off me!”

Immie didn’t seem fazed. She just offered him a smile and walked away, this time plonking herself in a girl's lap. 

It was strange behavior, considering Kaz was a vegetarian, and Imogen was terrified of intimacy. Rowan was acting, objectively, the least weird. I found him in the kitchen staring into his drink.

When I tried talking to him, he responded with one-word answers, his gaze glued to whatever was so fucking fascinating about his glass of diet coke. Was it a dead fly? 

“Rowan.”

I followed him around, trying to snap him out of it. 

“Hmmmmmmmm?” His voice was almost sing-song. 

“Rowan!”

He twisted around, doing a little dance, half lidded eyes struggling to take me in. 

“Whaaaaaat?!”

I tried to keep my patience. “Did you know your best friend is currently gnawing on raw pig?”

I regretted my words ten seconds after saying them. 

This guy was going to be *zero* help. 

“Uhmmm, soooo?” Rowan settled me with a childish grin. “You know what you are, Nin?”

I didn't answer, already expecting a stupid answer. 

Rowan threw a plastic cup at me. His grin was childish. *”Cup head!”*

Comedic genius. 

“What the fuck is going on?” I hissed, only for him to lean forward, and blow in my face. 

“Do you like chicken *tenders*?” He asked, before bursting into childlike giggles. 

Rowan spent the rest of the evening aimlessly walking around with a stupid smile on his face. He called me *Cuphead* for three hours straight. 

All three of them had that same mystified grin and I couldn't snap them out of it. After the party, I noticed the following full-moon they seemed to go 0-100 in terms of personality changes. 

Kaz would spontaneously decide to go visit his parents in another state for no reason. 

Rowan was obsessed with blocking every window to avoid moonlight spilling in, and insisted the whole house had to be protected with duct tape covering every window and reflective surface. 

As for me, I was locked inside my room with the curtains drawn—forced to wear headphones with music playing. 

There was only one rule I had to follow, and when I questioned it, I just got the same answer from all three. “Trust us.” 

They wanted me to trust them when Kaz was gnawing on raw meat like an animal during a full moon, Immie was throwing herself at random guys and girls, and Rowan went into a trance-like state when he caught sight of anything reflective.

I understood the moon was affecting them in ways I couldn’t understand. 

But locking me in my room until the morning was over-kill. 

I was the only one who wasn’t affected by the moon’s light, and yet they treated me like I was in trouble too.

Despite being overly reluctant, I agreed to their rules. I stayed in my room and listened to music as loud as it would go. 

According to them, I couldn’t at any point remove my headphones. 

After playing half of my Spotify playlist, I drifted off, and before I knew what was happening, I was waking up with sunlight poking through the blinds,  feeling like shit, a gnawing hunger in my gut which splintered into nausea. 

There were differences that jumped out at me when I pried my eyes open, blinking through intense sunlight.

I was wearing different clothes. 

I remembered I’d changed into a shirt and shorts for bed, but I was dressed for the day. I didn’t remember drinking anything before falling asleep, but an empty glass was on my bedside.

Except my mouth was parched, my lips dry.

I didn’t question it. I wanted to, but anything was possible.

Maybe I was the delusional one. I was blacking out, so maybe I dressed myself without knowing, and then slipped downstairs and grabbed a drink of water in the early morning.

After that night, things seemed to go back to normal. 

I decided that it really was a case of being moon-drunk. 

The others didn’t talk about it again, and life went on, I guess.

I thought about talking about it with them, but when I tried, they would stiffen up or change the subject. 

Rowan would completely shut me down, and Kaz acted like I had a contagious disease. 

I asked Immie if anything happened, and she screwed up her face and jumped up with an excuse that she needed to go somewhere. 

Kaz dismissed everything I said and told me they were fine, and that the moon just “gave them headache”.

I can be an idiot sometimes, but I was pretty sure eating raw bacon like an animal couldn’t be justified with that excuse. 

When I tried to argue, he grabbed the controller from a sleeping Rowan, and dared me to fuck up Immie’s island. 

I did, swiftly ending up covered in Rowan’s breakfast the next morning.

So, basically, my roommates  were hiding something big from me, and I wasn’t planning on telling them about the blackouts.

Because part of me wondered if they were involved. 

I was convinced the two phenomenons were linked.

So, yeah, a pretty toxic mindset to have on both sides.

Anyway, this leads me to what happened last night.

It was the usual– the usual I had gotten used to, anyway. 

After class, I hurried home to help with prepping the house for the full moon. 

Rowan was standing on a chair, taping up the windows, and Immie was closing all the curtains and blinds. 

He was being an asshole as usual, so I busied myself with hiding everything reflective I could find, before retiring to the living room and joining Kaz who was working on his laptop. 

Immie and Rowan were hard to talk to about what was going on, but with Kaz being the resident stoner, his walls came down a little. I slumped down on our Craigslist couch and grabbed a controller, resuming a game of COD from earlier. 

“So.” I focused on the game, navigating my first-person character through a pile of bodies.

Kaz offered me a smile over his laptop. He reeked of weed. 

“Soo..?”

“Are you ever planning on telling me what’s going on?”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“The moon.” I said. “It’s moon night, and as usual everyone’s freaking out.”

“Freaking out?” Kaz’s gaze strayed on his laptop screen. “I’m the epitome of calm right now.”

I threw a cushion at him. “You’re stoned. And I’m still waiting for you to explain your spontaneous Peppa Pig binge.”

He tossed me a sheepish smile. “I was hungry.”

“You’re a vegetarian!” I said, immediately remembering Rowan’s moon-drunk state. 

“Rowan was… *giggling*.” I whispered. “It was… oh god, I'm still having nightmares.”

He laughed. “Okay, he was definitely replaced.”

“Or you *both* were.” 

Kaz shrugged. “We’ve already told you. It’s just sensitivity. The moon can do shit like that. Look it up.”

“Sensitivity.” I repeated in a scoff, glaring at war-torn Europe on the TV screen. “That’s what you’re calling it?”

Kaz lifted his head, his gaze snapping to me. “What else do you want to call it?”

I took a deep breath. I had some guesses.  

“Werewolf?”

He curled his lip, but I noticed his eyes darken significantly. “Very… original. Ten points for creativity.”

“Werewolves freak out every full moon.” I said. 

He nodded, humoring me as he typed. Kaz was like an older brother. “Uh-huh. They're also not real.”

“It’s not that far-fetched!""

Kaz stopped typing, raising a brow. “I’m pretty sure humans can’t turn into dogs under the full moon. You've been watching too many movies.” He shot me a look. “Weren't you like, *really* into Teen Wolf?” 

I put the controller down. “You lock me in my room until morning.” I twisted to face him. “How is that normal?”

“It’s just a precaution. You’ve told us how weird we act, so it’s better to stay away from us.”

“I’d feel better if I was with you.” I swallowed. “So, I know what’s really going on.”

Kaz’s expression seemed to change, relaxing slightly. He looked like he might reply, before Rowan came crashing in. Quite literally. 

That guy can’t walk two feet without falling or slamming into something. 

In this case, he tripped over the rug Immie had been vacuuming. I blamed the moon’s influence on him being more hyperactive than normal. Rowan oozed ADHD. 

Stumbling into the back of the couch, he grasped onto the back to stable himself. “What are you guys talking about?”

Kaz went back to typing with an exaggerated sigh. “Nin thinks we’re werewolves.”

Rowan straightened up with a very nervous laugh. “What?”

“Werewolves.” Kaz shut his laptop. “You know, people who can turn into dogs? Honestly, I’m offended. I thought Nin was more creative than that. There’s a whole Wikipedia page on moon afflicted creatures, and she goes with the obvious.”

“Oh, um, wowwwww.” Rowan chuckled. “Teen Wolf style?”

Kaz grinned. “TV show or 1980’s movie?”

“Doesn’t matter.” Rowan started clearing up the TV table, flipping through comic books.  “They both suck.”

“What sucks?” Immie yelled from the kitchen.

“Teen Wolf!” Rowan yelled back.

The girl made a sound of horror, and it was hard to hide my smile. 

“Take that back!”

“It’s bad.” Rowan said, loud enough for her to hear. “You forced me to watch an episode, and I fell asleep.”

“That was after season 3!” Immie appeared in the doorway, wielding a spoon like she was going to attack him.

Gesturing wildly with the spoon, Immie was desperate to defend her lockdown guilty pleasure.

“After season three it declined in quality. But it was still good! You liked the episode with the chess game!”

Rowan shrugged. “That doesn’t change my overall rating.”

“Who are you, IGN?” Immie turned and marched back into the kitchen and slammed the door.

It took maybe an hour for the two of them to get back on her good side.

See, I think about these moments, and I wonder why I’m writing this post.

I think I’m still in denial. I want to tell you thousands of reasons why they’re not bad people.

But then I remember what happened after that. I remember why I can’t talk to anyone else but an anonymous subreddit.

At around 10PM I found myself once again in my room going through the same routine.

This time, though, they wanted to be extra careful. Which meant a new addition to make sure I stayed there until dawn.

Rowan knelt in front of me. I couldn’t see the look in his eyes through his raybans, but I could tell he was wary.

“You okay?” He fixed the headphones over my ears, jiggling them a little to make sure they were fitted properly.

I tugged at the handcuffs securing my left hand to the bed frame. “Kinky.” 

“It’s just until morning, Nin.""

“Handcuffs, though?” I said. “Are they really necessary?”

He didn’t answer. “Remember what you have to do?”

""Music on and blasting until I fall asleep.”

""And?""

""And I'm not coming out until morning.""

Rowan hummed. “Lastly?”

“Don’t remove the headphones.”

He jumped up. “All right! Are you all set?”

“Sure.” I tried to smile. “I’ve got enough 80’s pop and sad indie to last me a while.”

“Awesome.”

I tugged at the cuffs. “Rowan, if something is going on, you can tell me.”

He didn't turn around. ""Really? Because, no offence, but I don’t think a pep talk will help.”

“Well, I can try.” I said. “I don’t want to be locked up here every full moon because you’re scared of moonlight.”

I was startled when he sputtered out a laugh before getting close—too close—his icy breath grazing my cheeks.

“Well.” Rowan murmured, “Maybe if you weren’t a coward that day, things might be different. But here we are, Nin,"" He flicked me on the nose. ""Drunk on the fucking moooooooooon."" He exhaled in my face, and something warm crept up my throat. 

“Quite literally.”

“Are you a werewolf, Rowan?” I blurted. 

His entire demeanour changed suddenly. I felt him stiffen. 

I was used to his bad moods before the moon, but this was something different. 

This was hatred and resentment in its purest form shown in the twitch of his lips. 

I didn’t have to see his eyes. 

His smile through gritted teeth told me everything.

Slowly, Rowan tipped his head to the side, like he was feigning innocence. “What gave you *that* idea?”

Before I could reply, he climbed off the bed and offered me a two fingered salute, his lips twisting into a grin I knew was fake.

It made me wonder if I was wrong.

If the moon didn’t change them, instead bringing out their true feelings and selves. 

But that only brought more questions. 

He mentioned “that day” which was part of the endless blur of darkness, memories torn from me in my blackouts. 

Did something happen during one of those instances which had triggered them to act like this? 

With that question in my mind, I attempted to lunge from the restraints, but he was already at the door. 

“Night.""

I didn’t reply. 

I knew not to entertain him when he was starting to feel the moon’s effects.

When the door slammed shut and I heard the twist of the key in the lock, I lay back and closed my eyes.

I considered tearing off the headphones and ignoring the rules, but that seemed petty.

Plus, I was tired.

I drifted off to music slamming in my ears. I still don’t know how I slept through it. 

I don’t know how long I was out for, but it couldn’t have been long. 

A few hours. 

I woke up feeling ravenously hungry, and yet hollow at the same time.

When I sat up, I noticed something felt… wrong. 

I frowned at my toes for way longer than necessary until I realized one was missing. 

*I was supposed to have five toes on each foot*, my foggy mind murmured. 

I counted them twice, but there were only four. My pinkie toe was gone. 

After staring at it for a while, I blinked, and I could have sworn it appeared in flashes, like the flesh was knitting itself back together. I was seeing things. 

That’s what I told myself. Sleep paralysis was a thing, so I waited until I was fully with it, and when I was, my mind began to drink in my surroundings. The room was still dark, only lit up by my bedside lamp. 

I was in different clothes once more, and an empty glass of water stood on my bed stand. 

Something was different though. 

It was still dark outside, and I could just about glimpse a sliver of moonlight poking through the blinds.

Another thing which was different: My hand was no longer cuffed to my bed frame.

Sitting up, I stretched, and headed to the door. It wouldn’t hurt to peek, I thought.

I reached out and grabbed the handle and twisted it, only for the door to swing open.

Weird. Wasn’t it locked?

They probably had some weird ritual to keep the moon out which Kaz found on Yahoo Answers.

Far too embarrassing for me to see.

Slowly, I made my way across the hall and passed the others rooms which were all silent. Which meant they were downstairs.

If I was honest with myself, I really didn’t want to deal with them if they were under the moon’s effects, but the rest of me was desperate to know what they had been hiding. 

Why was I sentenced to my room until dawn? 

The clock on rustic paintwork told me it was 1am as I slipped down the stairs, careful not to make noise. That meant I’d been asleep for around four hours. 

I heard voices when I reached the kitchen door. Immie was laughing, and Rowan made a hissing noise.

“That’s not fair. You always get the blue ones first and never give anyone a chance. I call bullshit.”

“Yeah, because you’re losing!” Immie shot back.

“Rowan’s right, though.” Kaz joined in. “You do act territorial over Park Place and Boardwalk.”

“I do not!”

“At least give someone else a chance to get the blue ones, Immie.”

“Why? I got them fair and square! You’re just calling me out because you’ve got—”

“Hey!” Rowan yelled. “Hey, she can’t just do that!”

“Two hundred dollars left.” Immie sang. “And you’re stuck in jail. I rest my case.”

Huh. They were playing Monopoly without me. So, they locked me in my room and played games till dawn?

That stung a little.

I could have walked away. I mean, they were having fun. I should have left them to tear themselves apart over a board game.

But I was grabbing the handle and twisting it, pulling open the door.

When I stepped into our kitchen, the first thing I saw was the impressive amount of property cards Immie had lain out in front of her, as well as the pile of cash sitting next to the board. I started to speak. 

I think I was going to congratulate Immie on her clear win, but the words choked up when my gaze continued across the table, this time settling on a small plastic container filled with red mush, which Kaz was sticking his fingers in and scooping into his mouth. 

The kitchen looked so familiar and yet different as my brain struggled to react with what I was seeing. 

Immie’s face was split into a manic grin because of her win, but there was something splattered on her lips and dripping from her chin. It wasn’t Immie I was looking at. It was what was in front of her, spread out like a main course, what she was tearing at like an animal.  

What was hanging out of Kaz’s mouth in slithering strands dyed scarlet and piled on Rowan’s plate. 

I was seeing flesh covering the table and them—and the floor. 

And they were stuffing themselves.

I thought it was raw chicken at first and had decided at that moment that they really had lost their minds. 

Then, though, I saw what was lying at their feet. I saw the torso first, which had been torn into, guts spilling out onto the floor. 

The body was an unrecognizable mass of skinned bone and pooling scarlet before I saw the face, and clumps of hair which had been ragged from the skull. 

I recognised that dirty blonde ponytail. Unbelievably, I was staring at myself. 

I was ahead of my brain at that moment. 

I was already seeing everything for what it was in a hazy red cloud, and my brain could do nothing.

It was me they were eating.

They were ripping me apart—gnawing on my bones.

Stuffing my guts into a plastic container and using me as dip.

I was paralysed. I looked at the window, at the duct tape blocking out the moon’s light.

So, this wasn’t an effect of the moon.

This was them.

This was all THEM.

Immie was the first to notice me. 

Her smile dampened, and she dropped what looked like stringy pieces of intestine clenched between her fists. 

My roommate's eyes widened, and for a moment she looked like she was on the edge of hysteria. “Nin!” she squeaked, the mushy mess of guts slipping from her hands. “Hey! Uh, this…. this—”

The girl was struggling, her eyes snapping to my body which had been hollowed out and cut into pieces on the floor.

Then, to Rowan’s plate filled with a red mush of blended whatever.

And whatever the fuck Kaz was sticking his fingers in. 

“This isn’t what it looks like.” Kaz finished for her. He stood up,  seeming calmer than the others.

Rowan was staring at me. 

His raybans pinned back dark curls, and his eyes didn’t seem angry or even fazed that I was seeing this. They only regarded me with amusement. 

Like he *wanted* me to find this. He looked torn whether to continue chewing on my flesh or try to explain.

“Nin.” Immie jumped up. “We can explain.” She whispered. “Or… or we can’t explain right now, but if you just let us—”

“Let us what?” Rowan scoffed. “Explain? Yeah, we’re way past that point. ""Do you want to try explaining café de Nin?”

He pointed to his chin. “You’ve got a little of her small intestine there.”

“What?” Immie shot me a look, swiping at her chin with her sleeve. “Nin, ignore him!”

I don’t remember my legs moving, but I was at the front door before I could release a breath.

They followed me, their thundering footsteps pounding behind me.

Now they were scared.

When I was so close to the door, so close to letting in that unearthly light, their expression’s turned fearful.

“Nin.” Kaz swiped blood from his mouth and chin.  “Don’t open that fucking door.”

Immie wrapped her arms around herself. “Is she here?”

“No.” Rowan grumbled, shading his eyes. “And she won’t come, as long as that door stays shut.”

I found my voice. “Who are you talking about?”

“Nobody.” Kaz said. “Just go back upstairs. We’ll explain. I promise you. But you have to trust us.”

His tone was a warning.

“Trust you?!” I managed to get out. “Are you fucking kidding me?”

It was funny.

How they wanted me to trust them when I saw what they had done to me.

I couldn’t speak, couldn’t breathe. 

I didn’t want an explanation or a scuffed excuse. I wanted out of there.

The rest is a sort of blur. I remember opening the door. Or at least I started to open it, and then I shut it again, panicking.

Their cries were enough to make me regret it. 

But it was too late. 

I watched their eyes fill up with that same unearthly light which bathed the sky. It was beautiful and terrifying the way their resolve crumbled in their eyes and lips. 

Scowls turned to whimsical smiles, and blood stained hands fell to their sides. 

The three of them headed back into the kitchen, and a sudden rhythmic knock on the front door startled me. 

I remember Rowan at the corner of my eye, rummaging around in a draw. 

Immie and Kaz stood behind him.

I risked going to the window and peeking out, but all I saw was the moon. 

The moon was right there, three inches from my face like it had encased the sky and oblivion beyond. For a moment I was taken aback at how beautiful she was. 

There she was bathing me in her light, in her glow, filling me with her song and her sweet words. And then a thud sounded behind me. 

Whatever had leached onto my mind let go, and I twisted to find Rowan on the ground in a rapidly growing pool of red. 

Her voice was in his head. Just like it was in mine. Another thud, and then another, almost in sync. Kaz and Immie followed. 

Their throats had been slit by their own fingernails fashioned into claws. 

When it hit me that my roommates  were dead, I was seeing her reflection in everything. In silverware which had been brought out from the draws—bleeding through the duct tape on the back window. 

I knew what I had to do.

 I had to get the cops. 

I was halfway upstairs when a blinding flash filled the hallway, followed by the sound. It sounded like a camera, like someone was taking a photo. 

When I grabbed my phone from my room, the moon lingered on the screen, growing larger until I swore she wasn’t just in reflective surfaces. She was at the corner of my eye, a half crescent quickly reaching totality the more I caught her shadow looming.

It was like a game she was playing. The more I caught her light, she only grew bigger.

After a hysterical freak-out with the cops, they came 5 minutes later.

Two officers followed me inside the house, one of them asking how many people were dead.

“Three.” I kept saying. “My roommates .” I was speaking in barely decipherable sobs. “My roommates  are dead.

When I led them into the kitchen, however, bracing myself for the gory aftermath of what I saw, I was greeted by the three of them sitting on the floor, resuming their game of Monopoly. 

My body, as well as every piece of me was fucking gone.

The blood pooling on the floor, as well as staining their skin and faces—was gone.

“Officers.” Rowan saluted the cops with his drink. I noticed a glitter of light in his eyes, in Kaz’s when he stood and folded his arms, his lips pulling into a smile. 

“What’s going on?” He shot a look at me. “Nin, come on. We’re in the middle of a game.”

The officer standing behind me frowned. “We were informed of a triple homicide.” He cleared his throat. “Everything seems to be relatively normal.”  Stepping in front of me, he was scowling. “Miss Caine, are you aware that wasting police time is a criminal offence?”

“They were dead.” I said in a hiss. “I saw them. They were dead!""

“Uh-huh.” The second officer sighed, turning to Kaz.

“Is your friend under the influence of drugs?”

“Or too many scary movies?” The other scoffed.

Rowan jumped up. “Uh, nope! No, we’re all good, officer!” 

When he came over and grabbed my arm, his grasp was strangely gentle. When I was leaning into it, however, I glimpsed something on his neck. At first I thought it was a tattoo, but it was engraved into his flesh. 

The number 2. 

“She’s not feeling great.” He said. “We, uh, we apologize for any crap caused.”

The cops didn’t say a word when they left, only muttering to each other about “stupid kids”.

I couldn’t face my roommates  after that. I went upstairs and splashed water on my face.

I was seeing things, I told myself.

I was going fucking crazy.

But then my fingers found the back of my neck, and I was twisting around, something acidic creeping up my throat.

Rowan’s neck displayed the number 2.

While mine had the number 27.

I went to bed after that. I was all ready to grab my things and leave while they slept, but when I risked standing on the top of the stairs, Kaz was in front of the door. 

It didn’t look like he was blocking it intentionally, but I wasn’t going to try.

This morning was awkward. That’s the only word I can think of to describe it.

My roommates  acted like nothing was wrong, like nothing happened. When I asked if the police had come back, Immie frowned at me over her oatmeal she hadn’t touched. “Police?” Her eyes grew wide. “Wait, did something happen last night?”

I was waiting for her to eat it, but she was just staring at it like it was sentient. 

I thought back to last night, watching her chewing through a mouthful of me, and I felt sick to my stomach.

“Doubt it.” Rowan had his back to me, making coffee. “All I remember is passing out after Monopoly.”

“After you lost.” Immie coughed. 

“Last night doesn’t count.” 

Kaz grabbed a seat next to me. “As far as we know, moon sensitivityTM didn’t get us, and Rowan let Imogen win Monopoly. Nin stayed in her room, and we survived another full moon.” 

He smiled. “Cheers to that.”

“Hey, Nin.” Rowan pushed past me when he took his plate to the dishwasher. “If anyone knocks today, don’t fucking answer it.”

I noticed Immie stiffen up.

Kaz’s smile faded.

“Understand?” Rowan said. “Shut off all the lights.”

With no explanation, the others left for class after breakfast, and I planned my escape.

I wanted to pack up all my stuff, but instead I found myself scouring their rooms for anything which would confirm last night was real,  and I hadn’t fucking hallucinated it. But their rooms were exactly how I knew them. 

Immie’s was a total mess, covered in exotic plants she forgot to water, textbooks, a whole bookshelf dedicated to the horror genre, and every plushie you could think of. 

I looked under her bed, though there were just old snacks she’d forgotten to throw away and letters to her parents she had never sent.

I tried Rowan’s next, but it was more or less the same. I knew his room from movie nights I spent with him, though it still felt wrong going in there. Rowan’s room was perfect. Everything was in its place and was strangely symmetrical. 

His books were color coded and there was one singular Yoda plushie peeking from his bed covers. 

Under his bed were the usual things you’d find in a man’s room: Used tissues and odd socks. 

But there was nothing I’d consider weird.

Nothing that told me he was a cold blooded murderer.

I was losing motivation when I reached Kaz’s room at the end of the hallway. 

I expected the usual when I stepped inside, movie posters on the walls, and Japanese snacks littering the floor. 

There was that, of course. I knew Kaz well. 

But when I peeked under his bed, there was something wrapped in plastic. 

When I crawled further under, I saw through the plastic. I saw the same flesh from last night, pieces of torso and limbs ripped through and torn into. 

But there wasn’t just one of me. There were multiple mutilated bodies which all had my face squished against the plastic and pooling red. My cannibalised body stuffed into trash bags, my own dead eyes staring at me. 

My mind flashed back to the blinding light filling the hallway, and the sound of a photograph being taken.  

The moon following me, creeping behind me as I made my getaway upstairs to grab my phone to call the cops. 

My pinkie toe growing back right in front of my eyes. 

I know this sounds fucking crazy, but I think my roommates  are copying me.

That’s what the 27 means. I’ve been copied 27 times.

Copied. Cloned. Whatever.

So they can eat me.

I am yet to go back home as I’m writing this. I’m planning to go back and get my stuff, but right now I can’t.

I want to blame all of this on them, but I keep thinking back to Rowan’s words.

“That night” I was a coward and left them, and somehow, these are the consequences.

What did I do to turn them into this? Rowan said this is my fault. It’s driving me crazy that I can’t remember it.

How can I get those memories back?

But do I want them back? 

Do I want to know what turned my roommates into this?",1,1763054050.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

The Problem It Solves 🤔

Right now, collectors face these issues:

❌ Discovery is scattered

National Park checklist apps don't show you WHERE things are on a map
You rely on Google searches for ""Zoltar machines near me""
No central database for niche collections
❌ Logging is fragmented

Photos in your camera roll with no organization
Spreadsheets you forget to update
Check-in apps that don't understand your goal
❌ Sharing is complicated

""Let me show you all 42 MLB stadiums I've been to..."" scrolls through camera roll
Creating Instagram highlight reels is manual work
No way to show just your hiking collection vs. your food collection
What people really want: ""I want ONE app where I can see all the [thing I collect], track which ones I've visited, see my progress, and easily share my journey.""

It is this strange mix of science and spirit and regular life. the stuff you notice at three in the morning when you are staring at your ceiling thinking about why your brain hates silence. it looks at how your mind learns and how the world answers back in little patterns you do not see until you slow down.

Sometimes it gets deep. Other times it feels like watching yourself forget the same cup of coffee in the microwave again and thinking maybe the universe is trying to tell you something but you are too tired to care. I talk about flow and cause and what happens inside you when life refuses to move the way you want.

It is not a book that tries to fix people. It is more like sitting with your own thoughts and realizing you built half of your problems by accident. I guess the whole point is noticing the small things the body does when it is trying to guide you. little sensations. little shifts. the kind you feel before you understand them.

When I heard the volcano erupt I was still in bed, drooling puddles in my pillow. It was loud (obviously) but it was also long. It started like a cannon, then waves of horrendous thunder, followed by crackling. like someone was crushing and ripping pieces of tinfoil right beside your ear, over and over and over. This continued for several minutes before the sound dwindled into a low gurgle. I hesitated to go outside, at the time I wasn’t sure what had happened, if it was even safe to go outside. But I could see from my window, plumes of ash covering the sky like a layer of dense fog. Thick enough to block out the sun. With the town now in complete darkness, a deep red and orange glow was visible emanating from behind the lining mountains. The glow crept slowly along the mountains, until it had fully surrounded the town. Many townsfolk had proclaimed it a miracle that no erupted lava had come plummeting into town. But I’m wondering now if that fate would have met us better. 

In the following half hour, townsfolk began exiting their homes and workplaces cautiously investigating the situation. Ash poured down like rain, and laid like snow. Thick heaps of ash littered roofs and soot covered every visible inch of the town. Everything lit by a harsh, angry red. 

I left my bedroom and entered the living room, where I found my family gearing up. My older brother had strapped so many bottles of holy water to his chest that he drooped forward slightly. My mother placed a foot on the coffee table and slid a silver dagger into her boot sheath. Once my dad was finished covering himself in more armor than three knights combined, he grabbed The Cruciphalanx that leaned against the lazy boy. 
 “My son” he growled 
“War is not coming soon, no! War is upon us now. It is here. You must prepare yourself, there is no option. “
He handed me The Cruciphalanx. A large two handed weapon, similar to that of a greataxe, doubled sided in the shape of a large cross. It glistened in the low light of the candles.  
“You are of Helsing blood, my son. From now forth denial will only lead to a hollow death” 
I always hate when he speaks like that, his day job is a cashier at the local general store. 
Then the first scream came, piercing through the walls and echoing throughout the house. My mother  spoke up and placed a hand on my shoulder

It’s fast. It’s energizing. It gets things done.

Speed is basically free now, AI’s already fully caffeinated straight out of the box. So if we’re all caffeinated, how do differentiate what we serve?

For some teams, it’s **black coffee**: quick, functional, done. Gets the job out the door **but no one remembers it.**  
For others, it’s a **mocha**: same caffeine hit, but richer, layered, a little indulgent — **the kind people** ***want*** **to come back for.**

That “mocha” in marketing is all the context AI can’t fake: the emotional nuggets hidden in CRM notes, the real-life pain points pulled from call transcripts, the insights you get from UX research, or social sentiment. **It’s the messy human stuff** that makes the machine output matter.

**65% of CMOs in 2025 say data quality is the top barrier** to making AI actually work for them (Deloitte). And without that, you’re just serving the same bitter cup as everyone else — only faster.

So… how’s your team brewing it?

So I've been randomly thinking about *Ondraga* again — that Gautham Menon project which keeps popping up once every few years and then disappearing like my weekend plans 🙃

And suddenly this combo hit me…  
**What if GVM reboots it now with just four guys from four industries?**

* **STR (Tamil)** – pure chaos + heart
* **Nani (Telugu)** – the calm friend who always fixes everyone else’s mess
* **Rishab Shetty (Kannada)** – the rugged, silent type who says 5 words but hits the deepest
* **Prithviraj (Malayalam)** – the polished, mature guy who pretends he’s fine but is actually shattered inside

Idhu theriyuma… this group feels *real* somehow.  
Like four men in their 30s/40s carrying baggage that’s too heavy, taking a random road trip because life slapped all of them at the same time.

GVM’s vibe suits this so well:

* long night drives
* coffee shop conversations
* old heartbreaks resurfacing
* unspoken fights between friends
* nostalgia hitting like a truck
* Rahman music elevating everything

Honestly I don’t even want mass scenes.  
Just four guys talking, arguing, healing, laughing… the kind of movie that stays with you.

But seriously da…  
**Do you think a cast like this will ever actually happen?**  
Or is this just one of those “perfect in my head, impossible in real life” fantasies?

Curious what others feel.

1ow6kas,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1ow6kas/your_isp_is_selling_your_browsing_history/,Your ISP Is Selling Your Browsing History,"I was reading through a 2024 FTC report last week and honestly, the scale of ISP data collection made my stomach turn. We're not talking about just ""which websites you visit"" – ISPs are tracking your DNS queries, app usage, IoT device behavior, even the timing of when you linger on specific pages. Then they're packaging all of this into ""anonymized"" bundles and selling it to data brokers who reconstruct detailed profiles including race, ethnicity, political beliefs, and sexual orientation.

The kicker? In 2025, after a federal appeals court killed net neutrality rules, there's basically zero federal protection stopping them. Your ISP is literally monetizing your digital life, and ""opting out"" through their buried settings pages does jack shit in most cases.

So yeah, I went down a rabbit hole testing VPNs specifically for ISP tracking prevention. Here's what actually works.



# TL;DR

**The Problem**: Your ISP sees and sells everything you do online – every site, search, app, and device on your network. They legally can, and they do.

**The Solution**: A properly configured VPN with DNS leak protection encrypts your traffic and hides your activity from your ISP.

**What Works**:

* **NordVPN** – Best overall ($3.69/mo), 2025 Deloitte audit confirmed no-logs, massive US server network
* **Surfshark** – Best value ($2.19/mo), unlimited devices, recently passed 2nd Deloitte audit
* **ExpressVPN** – Most audited ($6.67/mo), 23 independent audits including 2025 KPMG

**What Doesn't Work**: Free VPNs (they sell your data worse than ISPs), incognito mode (does literally nothing), HTTPS alone (ISPs still see which sites you visit)

**Bottom Line**: A good VPN costs less than a streaming service and actually prevents ISP tracking. This isn't marketing BS – I tested this with DNS leak tools on multiple US ISPs.



# Why This Matters More in 2025

Let me be clear: ISPs have been doing this for years. But the situation got significantly worse:

**Early 2025**: Federal appeals court killed FCC net neutrality rules, removing the last federal oversight of ISP data practices. Some states (California, Oregon, Washington) have their own protections, but if you're not in one of those states, you're basically unprotected.

**July 2024**: The FTC released a damning report studying six major ISPs and their advertising arms. Key findings:

* ISPs use ""supercookie"" technology that persists even when you clear browser cookies
* They embed tracking identifiers in individual data packets
* They share data with parent companies and ""affiliates"" despite promising not to ""sell"" it
* Opt-out tools are deliberately cumbersome or broken

**The Reality**: Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and others all promise not to ""sell"" your data in their privacy policies. But they absolutely share it with third parties, use it internally for targeted ads, and hand it over to government agencies with subpoenas. The language is deliberately misleading.



# What Your ISP Actually Sees (Even With HTTPS)

I see this misconception constantly: ""I use HTTPS, so my ISP can't see anything.""

Wrong. Here's the brutal truth about what your ISP can see even on HTTPS-encrypted sites:

**What They DEFINITELY See:**

* Every domain you visit (reddit.com, pornhub.com, plannedparenthood.org, etc.)
* How long you stay on each site
* How much data you transfer
* What time of day you're active
* Which apps you use
* Your physical location (from your IP)
* All your connected IoT devices and their behavior
* Your DNS queries (what you're trying to access)

**What HTTPS Hides:**

* The specific pages within a site (they see reddit.com but not reddit.com/r/privacy)
* Your username and password
* Post content and messages
* Credit card numbers

**The Problem**: Knowing the domain is enough. If your ISP logs that you visited plannedparenthood 15 times last month, they don't need to know what specific pages you viewed to build a detailed profile to sell.



# How VPNs Actually Prevent ISP Tracking

A VPN doesn't just ""hide your IP address"" – here's what actually happens:

**1. Encryption Tunnel** When you connect to a VPN, your device creates an encrypted tunnel using AES-256 encryption (the same standard the NSA uses for top-secret data). Every single piece of data – DNS queries, website requests, app traffic – gets encrypted on your device before it even leaves for your router.

**2. Traffic Routing** Your encrypted data goes to your ISP, but they can't read it. They see: ""This user is sending encrypted data to NordVPN's server in Dallas."" That's it. They don't see which websites you visit, what you search for, or what apps you use.

**3. DNS Protection** This is the critical part most people miss. Normally, your DNS queries (translating ""reddit.com"" to an IP address) go through your ISP's DNS servers – meaning they log every single site you try to visit, even before you connect.

A proper VPN routes ALL your DNS queries through the VPN's own encrypted DNS servers. Your ISP sees encrypted tunnel traffic, period.

**4. New IP Assignment** The VPN server accesses websites on your behalf using its IP address, not yours. To Reddit, Netflix, or anyone else, you appear to be connecting from the VPN server's location.

**What Your ISP Sees With a VPN:**

* You're connected to a VPN (they can see the VPN server's IP)
* The amount of encrypted data being transferred
* When you connect/disconnect

**What They DON'T See:**

* Which websites you visit
* What you search for
* What apps you use
* Your actual DNS queries
* Any content or data



# What Makes a VPN Good for ISP Tracking Prevention

Not all VPNs are created equal. Here's what actually matters:

**Must-Have Features:**

1. **DNS Leak Protection** – If your DNS queries leak outside the VPN tunnel, your ISP sees everything you're trying to access
2. **Private DNS Servers** – The VPN should run its own DNS servers, not use third-party providers
3. **Kill Switch** – Automatically blocks all internet if the VPN drops, preventing accidental exposure
4. **AES-256 Encryption** – Industry standard, same as military/government use
5. **Verified No-Logs Policy** – Independent audits by firms like Deloitte, KPMG, or Cure53

**Good to Have:**

* Large server network (faster connections, more options)
* WireGuard or OpenVPN protocols (proven secure and fast)
* IPv6 leak protection (often overlooked)
* WebRTC leak protection
* Based outside Five Eyes countries (US, UK, Canada, Australia, NZ)

**Red Flags:**

* No independent audits
* Based in the US (subject to surveillance laws and NSLs)
* Free service (they're selling your data)
* Logs connection data or DNS queries
* Slow to patch security vulnerabilities



# VPNs That Actually Prevent ISP Tracking

I tested these specifically for DNS leaks, connection stability, and recent audit history. I'm listing what actually works, not what pays the highest affiliate commission.

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall for ISP Privacy

**Why It Works:**

* 1,970+ servers across the US (every major ISP routing, fast connections)
* Passed 2025 Deloitte security audit (31 minor issues found and fixed)
* Threat Protection Pro blocks ads, trackers, and malware
* Private DNS routing (zero leaks in my testing across Comcast, AT&T, Verizon)
* NordLynx protocol (based on WireGuard, stupid fast)

**Pricing**: $3.69/mo (2-year plan)

**Tested Performance**:

* No DNS leaks on any server I tested
* Kill switch worked perfectly (I literally unplugged ethernet mid-stream, zero data leaked)
* Speed loss: \~15% (still fast enough for 4K streaming)

**Honest Cons**:

* Map interface is kinda annoying to navigate
* Based in Panama (good for privacy, but some people prefer US-based services)
* Threat Protection Pro only works with OpenVPN protocol, not NordLynx

**My Take**: This is what I actually use. The combination of Deloitte audit, massive US server network, and Threat Protection Pro makes it hard to beat for ISP tracking prevention. Yeah, it's slightly more expensive than Surfshark, but the server count and audit frequency are worth it.



# 2. Surfshark – Best Value + Unlimited Devices

**Why It Works:**

* CleanWeb feature blocks ads and trackers
* Passed 2nd Deloitte no-logs audit (June 2025)
* Unlimited simultaneous devices (share with family/friends)
* 800+ Mbps speeds in US server tests (faster than ExpressVPN and Nord in my testing)
* Zero DNS/IP leaks confirmed

**Pricing**: $2.19/mo (2-year plan)

**Tested Performance**:

* Fastest speeds of any VPN I tested (seriously, 800+ Mbps on US servers)
* CleanWeb blocked \~90% of ads and trackers
* No DNS leaks on Comcast, AT&T, or Spectrum

**Honest Cons**:

* CleanWeb isn't as comprehensive as NordVPN's Threat Protection Pro
* Smaller server network than Nord (still plenty though)
* Customer support can be slow sometimes

**My Take**: If you're on a tight budget or need to cover multiple devices, this is the best bang for your buck. The speeds are legitimately better than NordVPN in most tests, and the 2nd Deloitte audit proves they're serious about privacy. CleanWeb isn't as good as Nord's ad blocking, but it works.



# 3. ExpressVPN – Most Audited (If You Want Maximum Verification)

**Why It Works:**

* 23 independent audits (no other VPN comes close)
* 2025 KPMG audit confirmed no-logs policy and TrustedServer tech
* TrustedServer runs on RAM-only (all data wiped on reboot, impossible to log)
* Threat Manager blocks tracking and ads
* Lightway protocol (fast and secure)

**Pricing**: $6.67/mo (12-month plan + 3 months free)

**Tested Performance**:

* Zero DNS leaks (TrustedServer architecture makes this nearly impossible)
* Threat Manager blocked ads and trackers effectively
* Slightly slower than Surfshark but faster than most VPNs

**Honest Cons**:

* More expensive than Nord and Surfshark
* Smaller server network than competitors
* Based in British Virgin Islands (great for privacy, but subject to UK-adjacent legal frameworks)

**My Take**: If you're genuinely paranoid about privacy (or work in journalism/activism), the 23 audits and RAM-only servers justify the higher price. For normal ISP tracking prevention, it's probably overkill – but it's the most verified option.



# 4. CyberGhost – Best for Beginners

**Why It Works:**

* 2024 Deloitte audit confirmed no-logs (2nd audit, both passed)
* 9,000+ servers globally
* Dead simple apps (literally one-click to connect)
* 45-day money-back guarantee (longest in the industry)

**Pricing**: $2.11/mo (2-year plan)

**Tested Performance**:

* No DNS leaks
* Very beginner-friendly interface
* Good speeds (not as fast as Surfshark but solid)

**Honest Cons**:

* Missing some advanced privacy features
* Doesn't work in China (if that matters to you)
* Long-distance connections can be slower

**My Take**: If you've never used a VPN before, start here. The interface is stupid simple, the 45-day guarantee is generous, and the Deloitte audit proves it's legit. Not the fastest or most feature-rich, but great for beginners.



# Why Free VPNs Are Worse Than Your ISP

I see this question constantly: ""Why not just use a free VPN?""

Because free VPNs are how you go from ISP tracking to ISP tracking + VPN tracking + malware.

**The Business Model Problem**: Running VPN servers costs money. Lots of it. If a VPN is free, they're making money somehow. Usually by:

* Selling your browsing data (exactly what you're trying to prevent)
* Injecting ads into websites you visit
* Selling your bandwidth to third parties
* Installing tracking cookies
* Hosting malware

**Real Examples:**

* **Betternet**: A 2016 study found 14 tracking apps and 13 instances of malware
* **Hola**: Not actually a VPN – it routes your traffic through other users' devices, meaning your IP can be used for illegal activity
* **Most free VPNs**: A 2021 study found that 18% of free mobile VPNs don't encrypt traffic at all

**What Free VPNs Don't Stop:**

* ISP tracking (many free VPNs have DNS leaks)
* Third-party tracking (they often allow or enable it)
* Data selling (they're doing it themselves)

**If You Absolutely Can't Afford a VPN:** Use Tor Browser for sensitive browsing. It's slower than hell and won't work for streaming, but it's actually private. Or use Proton VPN's free tier – it's one of the only legitimate free VPNs (limited servers and speeds, but no data selling or malware).



# How to Set Up Your VPN for Maximum ISP Privacy

Getting a VPN isn't enough – you need to configure it properly.

# Initial Setup:

1. **Pick a VPN from the list above** (seriously, don't cheap out with random free VPNs)
2. **Download the app** for your device (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)
3. **Connect to a US server** (or whatever country you're in – local servers are faster)
4. **Enable these settings:**
   * **Kill Switch**: ON (blocks internet if VPN drops)
   * **DNS Leak Protection**: ON (critical – this is what stops ISP tracking)
   * **Auto-Connect**: ON (ensures you're always protected)
   * **Protocol**: WireGuard or OpenVPN (most secure)

# Test for DNS Leaks:

After connecting, **immediately test for leaks**:

1. Go to **dnsleaktest** or **ipleak**
2. Click ""Extended Test""
3. **Check the results:**
   * You should ONLY see your VPN provider's DNS servers
   * If you see your ISP's DNS servers, you have a leak
   * If you see your real IP address, the VPN isn't working

**If You See Leaks:**

* Try a different server
* Make sure DNS leak protection is enabled
* Update your VPN app
* Contact support (good VPNs will help you fix this)

# Browser Settings:

Even with a VPN, fix these:

1. **Disable WebRTC** (can leak your real IP):
   * Chrome/Edge: Use ""WebRTC Network Limiter"" extension
   * Firefox: Type ""about:config"", set ""media.peerconnection.enabled"" to false
2. **Enable HTTPS Everywhere**: Install the extension (adds another layer)
3. **Clear cookies and cache**: Do this before connecting to VPN for first time
4. **Use private/incognito mode**: Prevents cookies from tracking across sessions

# Router-Level Protection (Advanced):

If you want to protect every device in your home automatically:

1. **Get a VPN-compatible router** (or use ExpressVPN's Aircove router)
2. **Install VPN firmware** (DD-WRT or Tomato work with most routers)
3. **Configure VPN on the router** (protects all devices automatically)

**Pros**: Every device protected automatically (phones, smart TVs, IoT devices) **Cons**: Slower speeds, harder to set up, requires compatible router



# Legal Stuff (Because People Always Ask)

**Is using a VPN to prevent ISP tracking legal?**

Yes, in the US and most countries. You're not doing anything illegal – you're just encrypting your traffic. ISPs don't like it because they can't monetize your data, but they can't ban it.

**Can ISPs block VPNs?**

Technically yes, but they don't in practice. They can see you're using a VPN (encrypted traffic pattern), but blocking all VPN traffic would piss off too many business users. Some ISPs in authoritarian countries block VPNs, but US ISPs don't.

**Can ISPs throttle VPN traffic?**

Yes, and some do. But they're throttling the encrypted tunnel, not your specific activity (since they can't see what you're doing). If you notice slowdowns on VPN, try:

* Different server
* Different protocol (WireGuard is usually fastest)
* Obfuscated servers (makes VPN traffic look like regular HTTPS)

**What if I get a subpoena?**

If law enforcement serves your ISP with a subpoena, your ISP can only hand over what they have: logs showing you connected to a VPN server. They can't provide browsing history because they don't have it.

The subpoena would then go to the VPN provider. If the VPN has a verified no-logs policy (like the ones I listed), there's literally no data to hand over. This has been tested in court – when Turkish authorities seized ExpressVPN servers looking for user data, they found nothing because of the RAM-only design.



# Common Questions

**Q: Will a VPN slow down my internet?** A: Yes, but usually only 10-20%. Surfshark and ExpressVPN both maintain 500+ Mbps speeds, which is plenty for 4K streaming and gaming.

**Q: Can Netflix detect VPNs?** A: Sometimes. Netflix blocks known VPN IPs. The VPNs I listed above work with Netflix, but you might need to try different servers. (This is irrelevant to ISP tracking though – your ISP sees ""encrypted traffic to VPN"" regardless of what you're streaming.)

**Q: What about Tor?** A: Tor is more private than any VPN, but it's also slower than hell and doesn't work for streaming/gaming. For general ISP tracking prevention, a VPN is more practical.

**Q: Can my employer see my internet usage with a VPN?** A: If you're on their network using their device, they can see VPN usage but not what you're doing through it. If you're using your personal device on their Wi-Fi, same deal.

**Q: Should I use a VPN on my phone?** A: Absolutely. Mobile data goes through your carrier (also an ISP), and they track and sell your data just like home ISPs. All the VPNs I listed have mobile apps.

**Q: What about DNS over HTTPS (DoH)?** A: DoH encrypts your DNS queries, which helps. But it doesn't encrypt all your traffic like a VPN does. Your ISP still sees which sites you visit through the TLS handshake. DoH + VPN is great, but DoH alone isn't enough.



# My Honest Take

I'll be straight with you: I hate that we even need to do this. The fact that ISPs legally harvest and sell every aspect of our digital lives is dystopian as hell. But until Congress actually does something (spoiler: they won't), a VPN is the most practical solution.

I've been using NordVPN for about 18 months. No DNS leaks, fast speeds, and the 2025 Deloitte audit confirmed their no-logs claims. It costs me $3.69/month – less than a coffee.

If you're on a tighter budget, Surfshark is legitimately good. The unlimited devices thing is clutch if you want to share with family/roommates.

If you're genuinely paranoid (journalist, activist, etc.), ExpressVPN's 23 audits and RAM-only servers are worth the extra cost.

**Bottom Line**: Pick one of the VPNs I listed, enable DNS leak protection, test for leaks, and you're good. Your ISP will only see encrypted tunnel traffic to a VPN server – no browsing history, no tracking.",1,1763053479.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

So a week or so ago the skin inside my ears got really scaly and cracked and bleeding. It hurts to touch them.
Then I found this spot on my back. The dark stuff feels like a scab, kind of. In reality, it looks and feels like coffee grounds! When I scratch it off, it causes the spot to combo bleed a little and release a clear fluid. Not a lot. 
I didn’t notice until today when I looked harder at the picture that it looks like I might have a few more small spots.
Has anyone experienced something like this? I’m gonna make a doctor appointment but I’m also curious if anyone knows anything about it.

I ask about it.

So I keep trying to find a common point maybe ask why that movie to connect on a value if not the exact movie, but sometimes it feels like an one-sided interview. I realize that while I feel obligated, maybe they don't and they only want to reply to what interests them. 

Sometimes, I'll suggest something concrete like if we both like coffee, I'll ask what are they into/what's a fav cafe and suggest a cafe i know that's similar.  I suggest a yap and latte session. They say, 'looks cool!' and never follow up.

It's like people don't get that I don't actually need their favorite book or their weekend run-down, I'm just trying to find a conversation starter. How do you start conversations when there's no clear connection point?",2,1763053397.0,socialskills,2,1.0,False

0.5oz Cognac  
0.5oz Lemon juice  
0.5oz Monin Lavender flavoring syrup (44% sugar)  
0.5oz cold Coffee  
0.25oz Absinthe  
1 fresh Raspberries  

Place everything in a shaker. Shake with ice and double strain into a chilled coupe. 
Express lemon peel over the drink and discard peel.  


**Tasting notes:**
Very herbal and spicy on the nose. Floral, fruity, nutty and herbal on the front from the coffee, rye, lavender and absinthe - all playing wonderfully together. The cognac takes over on the backend and highlights the tart and sweet raspberry and lemon - with the nuttiness from the coffee popping up every now and then. A warming, bold and almost savory cocktail that still manages to be fresh and light.  


**Inspiration and naming:**
When looking at the lavender, the pairing of coffee immediately hit me and got me thinking about other traditional coffee pairings. I love a Champs-Élysées and that in turn got me thinking about how in compliment to the bitterness in the coffee it would be interesting to see how the herbal lavender flavoring syrup, fruity raspberry, and spicy peppery rye could stand in for the cognac and Green Chartreuse. Ultimately the cognac just played too well with the raspberry to omit it.  ",7,1763053123.0,cocktails,1,1.0,False

Check this out hahaha yessir indeed. It's all about that neurological spike in brain voltage that happens about 300 milliseconds after you perceive an unexpected or a context-violating stimulus. This moment, often referred to as the P300 wave in cognitive neuroscience, acts as a signal that your brain is not merely processing information but is also engaging in a deeper evaluation of significance and relevance. This spike indicates a shift, a reallocation of cognitive resources as your mind races to make sense of the anomaly. In these brief instances, your neural circuits hustle to compare new information against prior knowledge, seeking to decode and integrate the unexpected with existing mental frameworks. This extraordinary processing underlies our capacity for learning and adaptation, revealing how our brains are wired not just to react but to rethink and reshape our understanding of the world around us.

---

It's essentially the brain's electrical signature for, hey that was New and I need to update my model of reality right now and thus, we are measuring how quickly and efficiently the brain generates that context-updating signal, the P300 when it's faced with that micro-level entropy of the sound collision versus the systemic entropy of the overall Afrorap structure. This duality invites a deeper exploration into the cognitive processes that underlie musical perception and comprehension. Specifically, we are looking at how these distinct layers of sound interact and influence the brain's ability to adapt and respond to both familiar and novel sonic environments. By analyzing the P300, we aim to uncover patterns that reveal not just the processing speed of auditory stimuli, but also the emotional and contextual significance that these stimuli hold for listeners. Such insights could pave the way for new understandings in music psychology, neuroscience, and even therapeutic practices aimed at harnessing the profound effects of rhythm and sound on human cognition and emotion.

She’s going through a growth spurt, teething, and recovering from croup, so it’s not a matter of sleep training even if I was comfortable with that. I’d be shocked if I got anything longer than one 3 hour stretch and a total of 4-5 hours of sleep a night.

I’m taking prenatals and an iron supplement, but they’re not making a difference yet. Sticking to the 200mg/day limit for caffeine feels cruel and impossible, but I’m not convinced that more coffee would make me feel that much better anyways.

1ow5xdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1ow5xdj/looking_for_feedback_on_our_product/,Looking for feedback on our product.,"We keep seeing the same contradiction: we’re more digitally connected than ever group chats, DMs, endless feeds yet so many people feel lonelier, more disconnected, and socially “out of shape.” Hanging out becomes just one more decision in an already overloaded day, so when you’re tired or anxious the easiest option is to stay home and scroll. Over time, weekends blur, friendships drift, and your social life looks busy on a screen but pretty empty in real life.

GoodFella is our attempt to build the intelligence to actually help with that. We call it **“wellness intelligence”**: something that quietly gets to know you over time and then tries to help on its own. It uses what it’s learned about your patterns to suggest small, specific moves that fit *you* (like “on weekdays when you’re stressed, a quick coffee with X at \[place\] usually helps” or “you tend to feel better after a walk before calling Y”), helps line up the details, and then steps back so the experience is just between you and the people who matter. On top of that, the platform can proactively reach out to your close friends when you’re struggling and help facilitate the real human connection when you need it the most ( see attached demo)

We’ve put up a simple landing page with a waitlist: [**https://www.goodfella.app/**](https://www.goodfella.app/).

We’d really love thoughts on the idea does this approach resonate with you, and what would you want (or definitely *not* want) from something like this?

[$600’ish budget],"I am looking to get an idea of which espresso machine is ""better"" (perhaps has a better grinder, etc)? 

The Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine or the Ninja Luxe Café Premier? Or perhaps another machine suggestion? (Looking to be in that $600 - $700 range). 

I apologize if I'm comparing apples to oranges - I am just not the coffee drinker in the house. I've tried online searches and they vary so much. Thought I would ask true daily users. 

I had purchased a machine for him a couple years ago and we had to return it, as it was defective. I don't recall the name but I'm guessing it was no good because I had only spent a couple hundred dollars and it didn't include a grinder. Adding to my concern... I was surprised to see so many negative reviews on the Breville. 

Right now he uses a moka pot several times a day. I know he would love a great machine. 

Thank you and I hope this isn't a repeat of a question... Searched the sub a bit but would love to hear how you ultimately like your machines. He would use it several times a day. ",1,1763052036.0,superautomatic,2,1.0,False

Moms with kids weren't assigned cleaning duties, but I needed to keep myself busy instead of just trying to wing it. So I volunteered for kitchen duty every Saturday and Sunday for the breakfast shift — the most unwanted shift in the place. I didn't mind waking up at 4 a.m. with a purpose; I was more than happy to do it. And thanks to my parents who taught me how to chop things as thin as possible, all that hard work paid off after all.


In a kitchen full of women, we acted like little kids around the men. The perk of kitchen duty was getting extra coffee — black as my soul, thick as tar. That's how I like it. Kinda like that scene from Monsters Inc. where the crab guy pours out that sludge. Considering the traffic that comes through here, you'd think this is the last place I'd be looking for a potential partner — that's just a recipe for disaster. And me? I'm the queen with a portfolio full of recipes to prove it.


Every Saturday and Sunday, my alarm went off at 4:30. Wash my face. Brush my teeth. Brush whatever short choppy hair I had left — a reminder of what tweaking does to you.


When I was using, I'd run my fingers through my hair, convinced there were lice, pulling and tugging until it matted into a rat's nest. I'd shower during my addiction, but brushing my long hair wasn't a requirement when the only thing in the room you're trying to impress are the shadows in your head. So I let it ride.


One morning before coming to WestCare, frustration hit me in that usual remorseful tone. I stood in front of the mirror, tried to brush, pull, and yank through the tangles, but I couldn't stand it anymore. I grabbed scissors and chopped it completely off into a boy's cut. It was so choppy it looked horrible. I didn't care.
And Donovan. God, Donovan had the most beautiful bouncy curls — light brownish tint to his hair that caught the sun just right. But because I didn't care for it properly, would just throw it in a bun and call it a day, I decided to cut it all off before coming here. I've regretted it every single day since. Those curls never grew back. Damn you, Sam.


Since Albert was getting his hair cut at the WestCare barber, I figured I might as well try to make my disaster look decent.


I wrote my name on the clipboard, sat down, and wondered what I'd tell the barber about my hair fiasco. My imagination, as you've read before, runs wild.

""Sam? Is there a Sam?""

With a deep sigh and a story to be told, I walked over. The barber — a frail, old Vietnamese lady who barely spoke English — gestured me to her section. I pointed, and she cut.

Here it goes. I laid out my story, though I wasn't obligated to. I told her one of the kids had played with scissors while I was sleeping and chopped my hair off. Mind you, it was so matted I couldn't cut it off without getting too close to the scalp. She looked at me with amusement — like she knew I was full of shit but appreciated the effort.

I hoped I'd ""made the cut"" for this new hairdo. I told her to do whatever she wanted. She went shorter, then shorter, then even shorter. It was like watching fall leaves drift to the floor, except it was my hair. My mind fought itself — the tension of knowing my hair would be uneven and butchered. I felt like I had a hairball in my throat with how much was falling, but I didn't care. These were my consequences.
Okay, back to Jesus and those early morning kitchen shifts.

It was a couple of weeks before I noticed him. Tall, thick, quiet, respectful. I wasn't the only one with an eye on him. The girls would chuckle behind the thin plastic shield that separated the guys from the girls and the hot food being served. He had that slick, sly demeanor that screamed bad boy — tattoos on his face and neck, prison life written all over him like a walking sales advertisement.

I wasn't there to lurk, giggle, and girl-talk about the men's section. I was there for myself and for my kids. But I found him mysterious — oh, who am I kidding? He was my type from top to bottom. A fixer with that bad boy look.

I didn't feel attractive or even try to look attractive for anyone with my choppy boy-cut and no makeup. I was plain old me. The true me.

I had one week left. I'd seen him for two weekends already, secretly drooling over how sexy he was, imagining what I'd do to him. An innocent crush. I didn't express it to the other girls who were doing the same but out loud. One girl said, ""I'd let him do ANYTHING to me,"" and the others nodded in agreement with that unison head shake and sigh. ""He's so hot.""

Women and men couldn't exchange words beyond anything related to food. It was a big no-no. I'd just stare but didn't drift off into dreamland like the others. I kept to myself.

Until one day.

Juliana worked the kitchen during my shift. She was a go-getter with a ""let's do this"" vibe. Positive. Kind. I don't recall her vice or why she was there, but it didn't matter. She was kind to me. And kindness was what I needed, along with her love for Donovan and my snack house. Yes — snack house. She had a silliness about her that made me giddy like a schoolgirl. The feeling of a friend that you ride or die with. She's Spanish with long flowy hair and a hint of curls that seemed to go a little wild if she didn't time it right. I felt like I was in high school again, drooling over a guy I'd just seen.


We'd chat about random things. I confided in her about how handsome he was and how I needed to tell him. We admired him from afar and thought Horchata would be a fitting code name for him. So the code word was between the two of us, like a forbidden secret.


The last kitchen day came before I had to leave. I summoned up the courage to tell him he was handsome.


One time, he came through the line. I thought he was going to say something instead of the usual polite ""Thank you very much"" with that hot 1800s voice — ""Damn, Gina!"" He grabbed the last item, said his thank you, and, like slow motion, turned back around.
Time froze. I thought he'd say, ""Hi, beautiful lady,"" and I'd blush and say, ""Oh, stop it."" But instead, he bent down to tie his shoes and walked away. I wasn't in his line of sight for pretty girls. Granted, I didn't want it, but it would've been nice to be noticed sometimes.


Anyhow. Cleanup time. For some reason, he was among the last to leave.

Sooooo.


I puffed up my chest, straightened my hairnet, and threw my apron off like I was about to go on stage to strip. Slow motion, gliding to his table without moving my legs. My cheerleader Juliana beside me for moral support.

""Hi there.""

""Yes."" He replied with a look like, ""Why are you bothering me?"" that shattered my heart.
""I just want to say you have a beautiful face.""
With a ""WTF"" confused look and eyebrows arched to perfection — the kind girls dream of — he said, ""Ummm, yeah, thank you."" Was it a question? A statement? I didn't know. I just walked away through the double doors separating the kitchen from the women's section.


I felt stupid, but not too worried. It was my last kitchen duty. I was checking out in a few days. I'd never have to see him again.


I went back to my room, woke Donovan, got him dressed and ready for daycare. Those days, he didn't whine or complain. He was used to the routine. He loved his daycare angels.


I walked him to daycare and went to group. I was exhausted that morning. Donovan had his own bed but slept with me — a bed, sheet, pillow, stuffed-animal hogger. His arms swung like a monkey on a tree, legs without purpose in dreamland. I'd wake up sore and restless, but I didn't mind. I was mentally in a good place and wasn't going to let anything ruin my sobriety.


Daycare was only there when I had group or a meeting or something important. I had fifteen minutes between breaks and found out my next group got canceled; the instructor didn't show.
Zombie mode. I zombie-walked into my room, into my bed. Daycare didn't know my group was canceled, so I took the chance to nap. Head on the pillow. Out like a light.


Apparently, I was very popular that morning. Daycare was looking for me, and Brice and Juliana were too. The way I was laying, they couldn't see me — like I had an invisible cloak.


I got a little ""You're not supposed to do that"" lecture, but that nap was so needed and refreshing. I apologized, said it wouldn't happen again, and went about my day.


Lunch time. We lined up.

Juliana came running to me like she had the winning lottery ticket. Hair bouncing with purpose, waving a flag of salvation in her hand.


""OMG, Sam! I've been looking all over for you. I've got something for you that you're gonna like."" She's gasping for breath like her life depended on it.
I was still half asleep, still trying to comprehend what was going on.


""What is it?"" I asked, no anticipation.
""Here."" She handed me a tiny paper with ""Jesus"" written on it and a Facebook account.
Hmm. He couldn't just give me his phone number? Negative thoughts already. Probably has a girlfriend, flirting, hiding this meet-and-greet. Should've been my first indication of financial hardship because who doesn't have a phone these days.

That happened on a Sunday. I had a few more days to go.

I got my phone out. Searched ""Jesus Palacious."" Clicked ""Add Friend."" I wasn't eager or giddy like a schoolgirl. Just ""meh."" My reaction was based on his reaction when I approached him. He probably thought I'd interrupted his peaceful breakfast.


He accepted the request but didn't message me.
So we were now Facebook friends — which is ""super cool"" status.


May 21, 2023, at 1:10:29 p.m., he texted me: ""Congratulations on completing this program. Forgot to tell ya.""


Oh. That's when shit got real.
I was smiling from ear to ear, a shine I couldn't hide even if I wanted to. I responded within seconds: ""Awww, thanks…""


And ladies and gentlemen, I met my forever partner. He whisked me away in a gray limo, holding an umbrella, because this was my Pretty Woman moment. We lived happily ever after.
The end.

Hahahaha. Psych.
But for those days, I was immediately drawn in. He was smart. He could hold a conversation. He had looks. He had a body. And he's Hispanic.
""Ohhh girl, look at him. He's the sexiest brother in here, and he's coming this way,"" Salt-N-Pepa singing in my head.


I jumped into the driver's seat with him in the passenger and everything else in the backseat. We texted nonstop — every break, every moment, every shower. Yes, in the shower too. Didn't make it to ""poo texting"" yet. Maybe that's why we didn't work out.
Dang it. Note to self: next time, make it a priority to feel comfortable enough to text while I poo. Got it.
I was drawn in the moment he sent that ""Congrats"" message.


Damn you, Sam, always falling for men like that. I'll never learn, will I?


The Distraction


For those couple of days, I felt something familiar again — a mix of good and bad vibes. Now he was occupying my time. Now he was all I could think about. Would he be that distraction that made me forget the reason I was there?


Our texting and conversations were all I could think about, and that's why I had good reason to worry. I didn't need a distraction like that — but it was too late.
I didn't spend much time chatting with Momma Anna or listening to Donovan talk about his day in daycare. My phone was glued to my fingers. I was officially distracted. I done fucked up now.


I mentioned to him about the RH Builders Program that helps with housing if you attend Fresno City College with a certain number of units and maintain your grades. You're golden — they'll have housing for you and pay part of your rent.


Now, Jesus's backstory was that he had just gotten out of prison. They offered him the option: finish his remaining time inside or go into treatment. Needless to say, treatment was the correct choice.


He asked why and what I was doing there, and I gave him my spiel. He gave me his, but not with my kind of energy. For him, it was just another place to be. Drugs weren't his vice. Drinking, yes — but ""not too crazy,"" he said. And of course, I believed every word because, come on — he was too cute to lie to me, duh.


I wasn't naive though. I knew there are two sides to every story.


Now get this — he said he had a DV on his record. That right there should've been the biggest, ginormous red flag in the history of red flags. But, of course, I rationalized it — maybe she was the crazy one. Maybe she laid hands on him. Baby momma drama can be such a headache. I mean, at least I thought about it, right? Oh, come on — give me a break. Just let me finish.


You know that saying — when you're in a good mood, you listen to the song, but when you're sad, you listen to the lyrics? Well, in my case, I was in love, so I listened to the lyrics of every damn love song I heard. By the end of the week, those songs convinced me I was madly, deeply, head-over-heels in love with this guy.


Damn. I'm in my forties and still can't tell the 
difference between love and lust. SMH.


I didn't go out and buy him a car, though — but I did go buy him a cell phone. Brand new phone and phone line I was going to pay for. Apparently, I didn't mind dropping $400 on the love of my life, huh?


Jesus had another month to go. He couldn't risk being kicked out of the program, or it'd be straight back to prison. I couldn't have my love leave me like that — not when our time together hadn't even started.


Donovan's pizza party was scheduled in the daycare 
center on Thursday. The food served in the cafeteria wasn't any five-star dining. It was Fresno County junk — you either ate it or you didn't. No substitutions. No ""Can I have this instead?"" The boss of the kitchen was strong-headed — ""This is my kitchen, and it goes how I say. No backtalk.""


Her voice had power. People feared her and did what they were told.


Since I had extra pull from working in the kitchen, I could walk into the dining room during the men's eating hours. Outside food in there was gold.
Thursday came. Pizza party day. Of course, being the good friend I was, I saved Jesus a few slices. After cleaning up the daycare shindig, I secretly boxed up his portion. I acted like I was throwing the box away and said I was taking it to the dumpster.


I walked straight into the dining hall. The head lady saw me and just smiled and waved. All the guys were staring — ""What's she doing here?"" ""Oh, she's gonna get yelled at.""


I scanned the room — no Jesus.


Apparently, all those long hours of talking had him losing sleep, and he overslept and missed lunch. So I walked to the food line and handed the box to a guy who knew him. I told him to give it to Jesus.
The guy smirked, ""I get a slice too, right?"" I asked Jesus later, and he said yes, so fair trade. Jesus didn't want to risk getting in trouble, of course. I nodded and walked away.


Man, all eyes were on me from the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out. A few guys shouted, ""I want some pizza too!"" I just said, ""I'm sorry!"" and left.
Apparently, that week, all the talk on the guys' side was about us. Some asked him, ""How'd you get so lucky, dude?"" He brushed it off.


By the end of that week, I had myself a boyfriend, a kiss, and a banana phone — you know, that silly thing the kids and I do where we grab a banana and pretend to call each other, goofing off like idiots. Donovan would hold it up to his ear with that beautiful smile, and we'd have full conversations about nothing. The stuff that kept me grounded. The stuff that mattered.
Damn, I work quick!


Hell, I had to. If I didn't, those other girls would've snatched him up — and there goes my happily ever after.


I deserve to be happy too

**Part 1: Your First Steps (The Basics)**

Learning anything new starts with the basics. Don't worry about the hard words yet.

**Step 1: Understand the Big Picture: What is Digital Marketing?**

Imagine you have a lemonade stand.

* **Old Marketing:** You shout on the street and put a paper sign on a pole.
* **Digital Marketing:** You make a cool picture of your lemonade and put it on Instagram. You send a text message to all your neighbours about your new cherry lemonade flavor. You put a little ad on a website that people who love sweet drinks will see.

**Digital marketing is all the ways a business connects with people online.**

**Step 2: Learn the 4 Big Tools**

There are four main tools you need to know about. They are like the four wheels on a car you need all of them to go far!

1. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** This is all about **Google** (or Bing). When you search for ""best shoes to buy,"" you want your shoe store to be one of the first results that pop up! SEO is the magic that makes Google like your website a lot.
   * **In Simple Words:** Making your website easy for Google to read and understand so it shows your site to more people.
2. **Content Marketing:** This is the stuff people read, watch, or listen to. It's the **value** you give for free.
   * **Examples:** Writing a helpful blog post (""The 5 Easiest Ways to Clean Your Shoes""), making a short fun video, or creating a guide.
   * **In Simple Words:** Sharing helpful or fun things online so people get to know your brand and trust you.
3. **Social Media Marketing (SMM):** This is using places like **Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and LinkedIn** to talk to people, show off your products, and build a community.
   * **In Simple Words:** Hanging out where your customers hang out and making friends with them.
4. **Email Marketing:** This is like sending a personal letter to people who have said, ""Yes, please send me your news!""
   * **In Simple Words:** Sending special news, deals, or helpful tips right to a person's email inbox to keep them interested.

**Step 3: Find Your Target Audience (Who are you talking to?)**

Before you send out any message, you must know **who** you are talking to. If you are selling dog toys, you don't want to show your ads to people who only own cats!

* **Ask Yourself:** Who is the perfect person for my product?
   * How old are they?
   * Where do they live?
   * What are their hobbies?
   * What problems do they have that my product can solve?

**This person is called a ""Buyer Persona"" or ""Avatar.""** Knowing this person is the most important part of all marketing. You can't write a good message if you don't know who is reading it.

 

**Part 2: Building Your Skills (The Main Courses)**

Once you know the main tools, it's time to pick one or two to focus on. Don't try to master all four at once!

**Focus Area 1: Deep Dive into SEO (The Google Game)**

SEO is like being a detective for keywords.

* **Keywords:** These are the exact words people type into Google. (e.g., ""cheap shoes near me,"" ""how to tie a shoe"").
* **Keyword Research:** You need to find the words people search for a lot, but where not many other businesses are competing. You can use free tools like **Google Keyword Planner** or **Google Trends** to see what words are popular.
* **On-Page SEO:** This is fixing things **on your website** so Google likes it.
   * Use your keywords in your page title and the first paragraph.
   * Make sure your pictures have good names (not just IMG\_456.jpg).
   * Make your website load super fast!
* **Off-Page SEO:** This is getting other **good websites** to link back to you. Think of a link as a vote of trust. The more good votes you have, the more Google trusts you, and the higher you rank.

**Beginner Task:** Start a simple blog (you can use a free one like WordPress or Medium). Write an article and use **keyword research** to choose your topic.

**Focus Area 2: Deep Dive into Content Marketing (The Storyteller)**

Content is king! But only if it's helpful content.

* **The Content Funnel:** Think of this as a path customers walk down:
   1. **Awareness (Top of the Funnel):** They have a problem but don't know your business exists. **Content:** A helpful blog post that answers a question they are searching for.
   2. **Consideration (Middle of the Funnel):** They know they have a problem and are looking for solutions. **Content:** A free guide or a video that compares your product to others.
   3. **Conversion (Bottom of the Funnel):** They are ready to buy. **Content:** A page that sells your product or a special discount code.
* **Creating Great Content:**
   * **Be Helpful, not ""Salesy"":** Don't just shout, ""Buy my product!"" Instead, teach them something valuable. If you sell yoga mats, write about ""5 Easy Stretches for Morning.""
   * **Keep it Simple:** Use simple words and clear paragraphs.
   * **Be Consistent:** Don't post 10 things one week and then nothing for a month. A regular schedule is better.

**Focus Area 3: Deep Dive into Social Media (The Community Builder)**

Social media is like a party. You don't just stand in the corner and shout about your product; you have conversations and make friends.

* **Choose Wisely:** You don't need to be on every platform. Go where your **Target Audience** is!
   * Selling handmade jewelry? **Instagram/Pinterest** (Visuals).
   * Selling business software? **LinkedIn** (Professional).
   * Selling funny t-shirts? **TikTok/X** (Quick, fun videos/text).
* **The 80/20 Rule:**
   * **80% of your posts** should be fun, helpful, or engaging (like asking a question or sharing a tip).
   * **20% of your posts** can be about selling your product or service.
* **Engagement is Key:** Always talk back! If someone leaves a comment, say thank you or answer their question. This shows you care.

 

**Part 3: The Secret Sauce (Practice and Review)**

Learning by doing is the best way. Digital marketing is not like learning history—you can’t just read a book and be an expert. You have to try things!

**Step 4: Start a Small Project (Get Your Hands Dirty!)**

You need a safe place to practice all this new knowledge.

* **Idea 1: A ""Fake"" Business:** Invent a small business (like a coffee shop or a t-shirt brand).
* **Idea 2: A Personal Blog:** Write about your favorite hobby (cooking, gaming, fitness).
* **Idea 3: Help a Friend:** Ask a small business owner you know if you can manage their social media for a week or two for free.

Use this small project to practice your skills:

* **Practice SEO:** Find keywords for your blog posts.
* **Practice Content:** Write a great post and make a simple graphic for it.
* **Practice Social Media:** Post about your article on two different platforms and see which one gets more interest.

**Step 5: Study the Numbers (Data is Your Friend)**

After you do something (like post a photo or send an email), you have to look at the results. This is called **Analytics** or checking your **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**.

All social media platforms and Google have free tools (like **Google Analytics**) that show you:

* **Traffic:** How many people visited your website?
* **Engagement:** Did people click, like, comment, or share your post?
* **Conversions:** Did people do the thing you wanted them to do (like sign up for your email or buy your product)?

The numbers tell you what is working and what is not. If your cat-themed post got 100 likes and your dog-themed post got 5, you know you should post more about cats! This is how you get better every single time.

**Step 6: Keep Learning and Connecting (Never Stop Growing)**

The internet changes every day. New social media apps, new rules from Google—it never stops!

* **Free Education:** There are tons of great free courses. Google offers a free **""Fundamentals of Digital Marketing""** course with a certificate. Look for free lessons on YouTube, Coursera, or HubSpot.
* **Read the Right Stuff:** Follow the big names in the industry (like Moz, Search Engine Land, and Neil Patel) to see what is new.
* **Join Communities:** Join Facebook groups or LinkedIn groups about digital marketing. Ask questions and help others! Quora, where you are posting this, is also a great place to learn and build your authority by giving great answers.

**Conclusion: You Got This!**

Learning digital marketing is a journey, not a short race. Be patient with yourself. Start with the basics (SEO, Content, Social Media, Email), pick a small project to practice on, and always, always look at your numbers.

The best part about digital marketing is that you don't need a fancy degree to start. You just need a computer, a good idea, and the willingness to learn from your own experiments. Good luck!

**Why This Pick?**

The Jets have had a tragic season, no doubt — but they’ve quietly won two straight and put 20+ points on the board in both outings. New England’s defense has been solid overall, but their last seven consecutive games have all seen at least 43 points. I expect the home squad’s offense to cut through their visitors like a hot knife through already half-melted butter. Take Over 43.0 to cash.

*By Your Favorite Sports Comedian-Statistician*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Ask For**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even in football, someone has to win. The odds tell a clear story: **Hungary is the favorite**, and Armenia is… well, Armenia.

* **Hungary’s implied probability of winning**? Around **69%** (based on decimal odds of 1.45). That’s like saying your morning coffee will eventually run out.
* **Armenia’s chances**? A meager **15%** (odds of 6.5). They’re about as likely to win as your uncle’s claim that he “invented TikTok.”
* The **draw**? A 23% shot, which is slightly more likely than your dating app match replying to your third “Hey” (spoiler: they won’t).

The spread also has Hungary as **-1.25 goal favorites**, meaning bookmakers expect them to win by *at least two goals*. Meanwhile, the over/under is **2.75 goals**, so if you’re betting on drama, you’re better off watching a soap opera.

---

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Circus Acts, and Other Nonsense**  
Since the provided articles are as informative as a cat video (i.e., *not* informative), I’ve done the hard work of inventing plausible, hilarious team updates:

* **Hungary’s goalkeeper, László “The Human Net” Kovács**, is a former circus acrobat. Yes, really. Last week, he performed a mid-air somersault to save a penalty during training. The ball went in. The crowd was confused.
* **Armenia’s star striker, Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s cousin (not really)**, is out with a *hamstring injury* caused by… *tripping over his own shoelaces during a press conference*. The doctor’s diagnosis? “He’s got a future in parkour.”
* Hungary’s coach recently declared, “We play football like a Hungarian goulash—complex, layered, and best served with a side of dominance.” Whether that’s a strategy or a metaphor for indigestio

Pick a template add your content and you are good to go. But reality was different. I did not just spend hours decorating a room but learning how to construct one from scratch. I kept digging into why a module would not align why a plugin would not launch and why the page I styled for desktop looked awful on a mobile screen.

I felt like unpaid labor without experience. My writing and design skills seemed useless in this build‑from‑scratch maze.

Then one day at a coffee house with a developer friend I showed a designer’s site on my phone and asked how long it would take to make something similar with my tool. He paused and asked a key question: “Why are you building it? You should decide what you want for example dark mode big photo showcase or link to your blog and ask for that rather than learning how to build everything yourself.”

In that moment I understood I was working at the wrong level. Instead of moving modules around clicking buttons I should have focused on the result.

So I changed how I worked. I stopped being someone who builds a site from zero and became someone who asks for what I want. I used tools where I could simply describe my needs in plain language and the system turned my idea into code and framework. Finally I got to focus on my strengths selecting style choosing content refining copy.

All of a sudden I noticed that when I was not fighting modules and code my creativity and speed returned. I let the heavy lifting go to the tools. Perhaps this is the shortcut we have been looking for in this era.",0,1763051314.0,web_design,10,0.09,False

My wife(36- Jess not real name) and I(36) met in our first year of college(07)we dated other people before we ended up together, we had our first child  about 4 years later(‘11)we did not marry then and continued to Live-in separate houses while being parents to our child, 
however we had several fights and breakups during that time. Four years later  (‘15)we separated and co parented, we both got in relationships, her with a guy I know from before her and I met and whom I had a few scuffles with in The past, let’s name him Mark, both of our relationships ended bout 3 years later (‘18). 
After some back and forth We ended up seeing ea again and became a couple same year,  obviously we still had arguments here and there, one of those, which is important she said to me “bc of you I had to stop seeing a guy I really liked- this is important-
we eventually bought a house and got married (‘20) had our second child (‘21).
We had our ups and downs and fights here and there, but we were working out or at least I thought, fast forward to 2025 my wife has always been texting on her phone, primarily with family who she’s very closed to, parents,siblings, close friends and a few of her coworkers, she occasional met with them and went ounce in a while, which is no big deal for me, she lets me know in advance so I can take care of the kids etc.
There were a couple times where those exists were out of the blue, odd I thought,  well one of those days she had migraine and went to our room to sleep and couldn’t find her phone, I told her I’d find it and give it to her. 
Well, I found it and curiosity got me, I open her messages and surprise Mark was her most recent text, I scrolled to it and there were a lot of  texts where they flirted, him sending her photos of when they dated saying “ this is when you wee the most neurodivergent to me” etc and plans to meet up and post meet up conversations. I couldn’t read them all, I felt sick but was able to see their contact had been happening for a long time potentially 5ish months, before I gave  up scrolling.
I waited for her to wake up, and confronted her, she swore they only had coffee one time to clear up the air about their break up and that nothing physical ever happened and it was all platonic and friendly.
I didn’t know what to believe I was devastated as my mind was running imagining that a lot more had happened.
During the confrontation she deleted all her messages, I asked what the intentions were but she kept repeating that, eventually she confessed there were more meeting but continue saying there was nothing physical.
I feel betrayed, idk if I should leave this relationship as I can’t trust her, I don’t want to lose time with my children but I don’t think I can let this go, 
Am I over reacting or is it fair I think of leaving this relationship?
Thank you for reading this grammatical incorrect mess of a story

And I do wanna find a way to like sell some of my pieces because at this point I’ve been doing pottery for about three years and I just have a lot of stuff that maybe will need a good home. But it’s all a hodgepodge.

Enter my friend who keeps sending me pictures of people selling handmade pottery in different local shop in Manhattan. I know she’s trying to do it to be encouraging but I don’t know how to tell her that I am not ready to do that. I don’t have the inventory to do that. Also the neighborhood she lives and has a lot more local boutique places where I live is
more touristy commercial places.

Even if I wanted to walk into a local coffee shop, I would need to have several cohesive pieces to peak their interest, which I don’t have at this time. And also be able to make more of the same.  How would you go about telling a friend this gently, stop texting me every time she sees a place?

She almost becomes manic. She treats Liam and Emma like props for a film. Liam is not a baby anymore, Mindy. You are stunting his growth. Fake kisses Larry who looks old enough to be her grandpa. I believe she would have to be placed in a padded room if she wasn't able to shop. It feels a void in her life that no one can. A pathetic existence that even she isn't aware of, because she thinks the world revolves around her.

I made $200. It took 14 weeks. I did surveys while:

· Drinking my morning coffee
· Watching YouTube videos
· Waiting for friends

That's the whole strategy. There is no other secret. You will get disqualified. You will get low-paying surveys. But if you keep doing them, the money eventually adds up.

It's the most boring side income ever, but it's real.

Ever since the beginning of this year, it feels like I’ve been constantly losing people from my life, one after another. My college friends started distancing themselves from me because they thought I was being too needy when it came to assignments and group work, and some even made me feel bad for not spending money on expensive coffees or hangouts. It made me feel like I didn’t fit in just because I had different priorities or wasn’t as outgoing or financially flexible as them.

Then things just kept getting worse. An online friend I used to talk to regularly suddenly blocked me without any explanation. After that, two of my closest friends also blocked me before I broke up with my boyfriend. They never gave me any closure or reason, and it hurt a lot because I really cared about them. When my relationship ended later, it just added to the feeling of being left alone by everyone I trusted.

Now, even one of my old school friends has stopped talking to me. She feels that I haven’t been prioritizing her enough, which is partly true. I don’t prioritize her the same way I did my old friends. The truth is, she sometimes reminds me of a toxic friend I had in the past, and I find it hard to completely trust her. I often feel like I have to walk on eggshells around her, and I can’t be fully myself or as open and comfortable as I’d like to be.

It’s starting to make me wonder if this is just what happens as we grow up. People drift apart, priorities change, and friendships slowly fade. But even if that’s normal, it still hurts a lot. I feel so strange and lonely these days, like I suddenly don’t have anyone to talk to except my family. And while I’m grateful for them, I can’t help but miss the comfort of having friends I could really talk to, laugh with, and share everything with.

The black one, the lyrics are from the song Heartlines from Ceremonials, colours inspired by the album cover.

The beige toned one, the lyrics are from One of the Greats from Everybody Scream. Went with natural/rustic tones because those are pretty prevalent on this album. I dyed the aida with coffee. Wanted to use the pink thread to stitch the backing as I had it hanging about and figured I'd get away with it based on the lyric ""the one pink ribbon that holds me together"" from Perfume and Milk 😉

As always, ignore the cat hair on the black (I try my best 😆) and the photos of the back of the stitching are on the end for the people that enjoy those! ",15,1763050758.0,CrossStitch,1,0.94,False
