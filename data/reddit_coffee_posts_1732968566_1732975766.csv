Let me tell you about my learning story. Back when I started, I was really having a tough time. I remember sitting at my desk late at night, trying to study, but my mind kept jumping to other things - my phone, the TV, what I'd eat for dinner. I'd look at my watch and realize three hours had gone by, but I had barely learned anything!

I felt so alone until I joined a study group at my local library. There was this girl Sarah who was learning to code too, and she'd always bring coffee for everyone. Having these study buddies changed everything! On days when I felt like giving up, just seeing them work hard made me want to keep going.

I started doing things differently. Instead of trying to learn everything at once (which totally didn't work!), I'd pick tiny bits to work on. Like when I was learning Spanish, I didn't try to learn all the verbs in one day. I just focused on learning five words really well. Then I'd teach those words to my little sister - it was fun watching her try to pronounce them!

Something funny happened with coding - I'd get stuck on a problem and feel super frustrated. But when I explained the problem to my study group, sometimes just talking about it helped me figure it out! We'd celebrate every little win, even if it was just fixing a tiny bug in our code.

These days, I can build websites, help them show up on Google (that's the SEO stuff!), and even chat with my neighbor from Mexico in Spanish. But what makes me happiest is remembering how my study friends helped me get here.

If you're feeling stuck like I was, I totally get it! Some days still feel hard, but now I know how to handle them better. Want to share what you're trying to learn? Maybe we can help each other out - that's what worked for me!

What's giving you trouble right now? I'd love to hear your story and maybe share some of the tricks that helped me get through the tough spots.",1,1732975567.0,Learning_Strategies,0,1.0,False

[**https://github.com/henriupton99/AdventOfCode/tree/main**](https://github.com/henriupton99/AdventOfCode/tree/main)

Are you tired of manually downloading inputs, creating scripts, and wondering if you've fed your debugger the right file? Well, worry no more, because I’ve cooked up a **GitHub repository** that’s so efficient it practically solves problems *for you* (okay, not quite, but close)!

**💡 What does it do?**  
This magical repo automates the boring stuff so you can focus on the fun parts—like cursing at off-by-one errors and chasing that second star. Here’s what it serves up:

1️⃣ **Daily problems retrieval script** to fetch any day and year from AoC and auto-generate:

* `day_desc.md`: A handy problem explanation to read while sipping your coffee.
* `test_input.txt`: For when you want to dip your toes in before diving deep.
* `real_input.txt`: The real deal. Time to bring your A-game.
* `solution.py`: A Python script template because we all know starting from scratch is overrated.

2️⃣ **Solution runner script** to make your submissions effortless.  
Run any day, year, and part with ease, including:

* `part`: 1 or 2 (First star? Second star? Why not both?)
* `test_mode`: `true` or `false` (Go from sandbox to glory!)

**✨ Why you’ll love it:**

* Saves time.
* Makes you feel like a coding wizard (cape not included).

P.S. If you’re not automating your AoC workflow, are you even advent-ing? 🎅💻",1,1732975542.0,adventofcode,0,1.0,False

","It's been said from the start, Kendu Inu was created to be a multi cycle project. The price action that we are witnessing now for the project is crucial for creating a proper distribution of tokens so that long term growth is achievable. Consider it an opportunity of a lifetime to be able to enter a project as established and committed as Kendu at these levels. Here's a very brief look into the ecosystem if you are not familiar.

**Facts**

* We are the cusp of having 15K holders
* Kendu is almost 10 months old
* We rank top 10% in subreddit size
* We have an NFT platform that is still yet to be fully deployed
* Kendu is on ETH but will bridge to SOL (and most likely other chains such as BASE)
* Coinbase Wallet featured Kendu in their advertisement (every other coin featured in the same advert is now listed on Coinbase)
* We have Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu jewelry, Kendu merch, and much more.
* We have had several articles written about us in Shib Magazine
* Kendu Miazaki (dev of Kendu) is going to be speaking at Shibcon about Kendu
* We hit an ATH of 280M back in June before the bullrun even started
* We have the best organic community in the space, bar none
* A juicy fact about kendu, it's the only coin that is backed up with a campaign on okx (the second largest exchange ) [https://www.okx.com/campaigns/kendu-inu](https://www.okx.com/campaigns/kendu-inu)
* certik has just less than 750 votes left to be audited
* Bitget is partnered with kendu recently

Why is all of this relevant? I'm sure many of you have seen Bitcoin rise to historic levels these past few weeks, which according to past cycles, marks the start of the ""bullrun"". Right now, it is likely that we will see Bitcoin continue to rise above 100K and dominate the crypto market. Once Bitcoin dominance falls off, we will then see the true Altcoin season begin and with how things have turned out, it's highly likely this bullrun will be massive.

We are still in the prestages of a full fledged parabolic memecoin season and now is the perfect time to enter projects like Kendu who have firmly established themselves in the space and are entering the late stages of a major retracement phase. Now is not the time to chase green candles, it's the time to accumulate dips and get in on established projects BEFORE they explode; that is if you want to make actual life-changing money this bullrun.

There is a rising figure in the crypto space that goes by MustStopMurad and I feel what he says will ring even more true when this cycle ends.

""You are NOT investing in Memes. You are investing in PEOPLE. The Key is to find Communities that have:  
\- Inspired people hustling daily  
\- 6+ months old  
\- Survived multiple large drops  
\- Holder Count growing every month  
\- $20 Billion+ Target  
\- Great Distribution + Diamondhands""

Kendu Inu checks all these boxes and has grown to be the prime example of what it means to be a proper memecoin built to take full advantage of not only this cycle but future cycles as well.

Join the community and see first hand the dedication and grind we have no matter what the price action looks like. Paper hands will waver, but true chads will be here until the end.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1732975284.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

She keeps saying that my dad and his wife are a family and that we are systematically trying to oust her from our lives (while staying at my apartment for the last week LOL)...

She came over to my place from a foreign country and after hearing that my dad got me a coffee machine started going through every shelf and drawer in my apartment to detect what else I needed.

I find it crazy, and when I told her to stop going through my apartment and forcing me to spend my days at Trader Joe's or looking at amazon is not something normal; she attacked me physically, broke all my favorite coasters that they don't sell anymore and broke other things in the apartment. I'm full of nail scratches at the moment, and she just claims I am systematically making her go crazy so she would attack me and I could have ""evidence"" to show other people how crazy she is.

I don't know what to do. This is too much. She leaves every therapist as soon as they realize she's the problem, it's WILD. Does anyone have a similar experience? Does this even sound like BPD, or is it some other thing growing further.

I just wanna share my story here to seek some relief, grief, and conect with you. English is not my first language, so I apologize for any mystakes.

I (27M) fell in love with a coworker around december 2022. The crazy thing is I had no reason to. We never talked (only about work), never hang out together during breaks, nothing. I just thought she was beautiful, charming, and fell in love. She was in a 10 year relationship, so I did nothing about my feelings for her. 

Time goes by to August 2023, and some coorkers are going for sushi after work. I hear they talking about it the office, and I am not invited, and that is ok. But, as the day goes by, she invited me, 3 times. I respectfully refused, because I was tired. Then she invited a fourth time, and told me to grab a energy drink, coffee, and have fun with them. So I did it.

Dinner was fun, and when everybody was leaving, she could not find a cab or Uber (our town is pretty small). I offered a ride, she accepted. When she entered the car, it was the first time we were alone, just the two of us, in the same space, ever. 

And then it happened.

Suddenly, she tells me to stop the car, and I absoutely start to panick. She took a deep breath and tells me she is in love with me. She does not no why, but she cant stop thinking about me, about kissing me, about being together, even though she is in a relationship, she is in love. Then, after hearing this, I told her everything I felt. 
We kissed, and I took her home.

Days go by, she tells me she is not happy with her relationship, breaks up with the guy, and is going to move out (they lived together). She spends 20 days on a trip, came back, rented an apartment, and we start a relationship. 3 weeks later, she breaksup with me, because she needs time alone, to think about her life, and wants to be alone.

I was crushed. The girl I loved, in secret, for months, whom was in love with me, breaks up. So I spent some months taking care of myself, and she comes back and tells me to get together. Being the people pleaser I am, I did. And guys, for two months it was great, but the red flags started do apear.

I was going through depression about this time. She told me she felt cheated, because she once was depressed, and didnt want to back to that place, and i Hid it from her. This made me thing i was unworthy of her love, but ok.

Medicine gave ED. She told me ""be a man"", just enjoy, solve the problem or it would be over. Eventually, I did, but it made our sexual relations feeling like a chore, a job, to make her happy.

As time gols by, little thing happened that made me feel that I was putting to much into the relationship, and that I was not receiving the love I deserved. When we had a fight, she always held me accountable for everything she was feeling. 

I am crying, is your fault. I am having an anxiety crisis, your falta. 

So, we broke up and got back together about 6 times, and one day i just went full berzerk. She bought an apartment, and showed me thenkeys. I was happy for her, but wanted to tal about our relationship, to try to get things better. She just bursted into tears, yelling at me for bringing sadness into her life, that it was a happy day and i was ruining her day. She was crying like a Child. We woke up, her face was swolen and she told me she could not go to work, it was MY fault because I made her sad. I broke up with her, on the spot, and left. It was on the week of my birthday.

She bought gifts for me, and calls me be back telling me she doesnt want to lose me, that she loves me and so on. I was mad, angry, and feeling ressentment, but decide to try againg, just to find ou I could not. I felt like my feelings would never be heard, I was tired of feeling responsible for everything.

I eventually, got cold. My love was gone, and my heart was a rock. My mistake was not talking about it with her. She noticed, and breaks up with me once again telling she just wants love, to be with me, and I am distant. I told her I am just protecting myself, and I am willing to talk, but she not, and we break up.

After a week I decide to give her a call, and apologize for not talking. Well, it was a mistake. She yells at me like I thrown her love in the dumpster, how she cant forgive me, how I lack emocional inteligence, and leaves.

It leads up to right now, I feel heartbroken, alone, miserable. All I want is to hug her, tell her i lover her. My urge to call her and ask to try again is huge. Even after everything, I love her, and I know She loves, at least I like to believe it. 

Anyway, if you read everything, thanks for reading my story. There is so much more I could fit in but this is long enough.

It’s wholesome, funny, and the comments are always genuine and hilarious, sometimes really sincere. It’s been so fun hanging with all you girlies in our shared suffering of the detail button and bursting into laughter after each chapter reading the comments. This community reminds me of the Lofi comment section on YouTube in terms of good vibes.

And it isn’t just the comment section, it’s the readers, and the scantilation teams and their amazing advertising creations for positions and commentary (XD) that make bato so worthwhile. This isn’t even touching on the smooth reading experience and clean UI of the website.

So yes. If you’ve reached this post, have a break, have a cup of coffee and a pastry and take a moment to appreciate how these strangers on the internet can come together to smile and laugh together. ☕️☺️🥐 I know these websites don’t last forever, so I wanted to truly express my gratitude for this space. No toxic weirdos or misogynists or anything, just people enjoying a fun read. ^^ Thank you, guys. It’s been fun and still is 😊🫕.

1h3d380,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h3d380/the_unseen_neighbor/,The Unseen Neighbor,"The story begins on an ordinary evening. Suddenly, the doorbell rings. I open the door and see a stranger standing there. He looks friendly, with a faint smile on his lips, holding a bouquet of what appears to be carefully selected flowers.

""Hello, I'm your new neighbor,"" he says politely, his tone light and relaxed. The words sound strangely familiar, but I can't place why, so I brush it off.

""Hello,"" I reply curtly, a slight hint of caution creeping into my voice. He doesn't offer much detail, only mentioning that he recently moved nearby and wanted to get to know his neighbors. I nod, stepping aside slightly, indicating that he could come in for a chat.

As he walks into the living room, his eyes sweep over every corner of the room, eventually pausing on a framed photo resting on the coffee table. It's a picture of my daughter and me. He smiles thoughtfully, ""Is this your daughter?""

""Yes,"" I reply, adjusting the frame slightly so it faces me. ""She's currently attending Morning Light Elementary.""

""What a coincidence, I teach there,"" he says, his smile seemingly natural, as if this were just an innocent stroke of fate. I keep my suspicions to myself but don't let my guard down.

He begins chatting about moving and adjusting to the new neighborhood, his tone calm and reassuring. As we sit down, he seems particularly interested in the house. ""This place looks like it has some history. It must have many stories.""

I hesitate slightly, but manage a polite smile before offering a brief explanation of the house's background. He listens intently, nodding at each detail, an odd focus in his gaze as though committing every word I say to memory.

Halfway through our tea, his questions begin to grow more specific. ""This lamp is quite interesting. Did you pick it out yourself?""

""No, my daughter did. She likes the warm light,"" I answer. Before I realize it, he’s guided the conversation into many details about the house and our lives here.

He has a knack for listening, always finding the right questions to keep me talking. By the time he finally leaves, I realize that I've shared far too much with this stranger I barely know. Once the door closes behind him, the living room feels strangely empty, and a vague sense of unease settles in—but I can't quite put my finger on why.

A few days later, I receive an urgent message from work—a situation that demands my immediate attention, making it impossible for me to take my daughter to school. Despite my prior uneasy feeling about the neighbor, the urgency leaves me with no choice. I recall that he mentioned he works at Morning Light Elementary and might be able to help. So I decide to go to the address he had given me.

It’s a bright morning as I drive to the corner and find the blue house he had described. The door is half open, which strikes me as odd. Feeling increasingly uneasy, I step up and knock on the door.

A complete stranger answers, his face filled with confusion. ""Who are you looking for?""

I hastily describe the neighbor, but the man shakes his head, telling me that he has lived there for years and has never heard of anyone moving in.

A chill runs down my spine. I quickly take out my phone and dial the number he had given me, but no one picks up. Each ring seems to heighten my anxiety.

The police arrive shortly after and verify everything with the homeowner. They inform me that the house has had the same owner for many years, and there has never been any record of anyone like the man I described.

As the sound of sirens fades away, I stand in front of the blue house, filled with an indescribable fear. My mind keeps replaying the scene—him standing in my living room, looking at my house, my family, with that strange familiarity mixed with unease and something sinister.

I pull out my phone again, my hand trembling as I dial his number one last time. The familiar, empty ringing fills my ear, and eventually stops abruptly.

This happened when I was 17 and I'm 22 now but the vague memory of this incident still haunts me to this day. This happened when I was driving to my friends at night for a sleepover we had planned prior it was approx 9 at night. I begged my dad to let me take the car for once and well i got it. While on the way, halfway my friend texted me and that asshole cancelled on me, well I was disappointed enough but I still had the car to myself and my teen spirit really wanted me to get full use of it and my friend even cancelled so I needed to freshen my mind though one advantage I got was that my parents expected me to get home by the morning. Decided to drive around for a while I don't know what I was thinking to just randomly keep driving in hopes to reach somewhere. Saw a cafe around the corner didn't think that a coffee would hurt anyway I had to probably stay up for a while night. The drive to the cafe seemed longer than it actually was the vibe of it seemed really off and eery, so my instincts just told me to park the car in the parking lot and get nude a coffee. I went into the cafe didn't feel much. Felt hungry tho, got myself a plain sandwich or that's what they really had. I thought about sitting in the car while waiting for my order but knew running back and forth wasn't the thing I was really looking up to. I was sitting there in the cafe on my phone, I was sitting in a way that I wasn't facing the door. Thinking about how it's odd that how it was only 9:45pm and still barely any people in the cafe considering it was a small town and the cafe was at the very centre of the town it just made it unusual. Just then I felt someone walking upto me someone put their hand on my shoulder from behind i turned back just to see a guy I asked him what he wanted and he said,""is that Honda civic in the parking lot yours? 
""..."" I was blank 
""Move it. Now."" He said
Period, that's it. Very abrupt actually I don't know what I thought of but I just ran and sat on my car all sorts of overthinking started ""what were the intentions of that guy"" ""am i going to get kidnapped"" ""is this my last day, am i going to get KILLED!!?"" Suddenly I heard a knock on my window ""FUCK!"" I whispered under my breathe almost hesitant to look at my window ""phew"" it was just the waitress with my order. I thought to drive away you know that feeling, like when something wrong is about to happen? Just then I heard a bang on the back of my car my hands froze almost like I couldn't even move the steering wheel I jumped to the backseat and hid in the car felt someone creep through the window don't know if I was being paranoid or someone actually trying to see if I was inside, maybe a theif? Didn't know but I think they didn't see me inside because of how dark it was after a few minutes passed I tried to put all the courage I had to look outside for what was going on. The dumbest thing I did was not driving away instantly to the nearest police station when I saw the guy from the cafe dragging the waitress leaving a trail of blood behind only God knows how I stayed in my car the whole night.",1,1732974930.0,stories,0,0.99,False

1h3cx1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1h3cx1n/dead_mans_fingers_hemp_rum_a_canex_review/,Dead Mans Fingers Hemp Rum: A Canex Review,"**We collectively love a drink here at Canex and Spicy Rum may be a particular favourite for a few of us.** [**Dead Mans Fingers**](https://www.deadmansfingers.com/) **kindly sent us their Hemp Rum to try and review and boy, were we excited.**

Here’s what they say about their [Hemp Rum](https://www.deadmansfingers.com/our-rum/)…

“We’ve taken our classic Caribbean rum with its exotic spices and ingeniously infused it with natural hemp and CBD. As you’d expect there are district grassy herbal back-notes supported by a hint of cola, roasted waves of freshly percolated coffee, hops and a dash of pine. It’s all very delicious, a little bit grown-up, and a lot unexpected.”

First thoughts – you can spot Dead Mans Fingers branding a mile off and we LOVE it. It’s grungy and cool and the bottles for each individual flavour has an epic colour scheme. I don’t want to say I buy things just for the packaging alone, BUT… I do buy things for the packaging alone and I think their rum would fit my ‘nice bottle’ criteria.

The spiced rum biz was born from The Rum & Crab Shack in St Ives, Cornwall. Famous for their seafood and anything-but-traditional Caribbean Island affair when it comes to branding rum.

Let’s move onto taste, shall we…

Did I pour myself a gigantic tumbler of pure rum with ice? Yes, yes I did. But that is not as wild as it sounds. Not a liquor but pleasantly sweet, still with that earthy grown-up taste.

# Our Cocktail recommendation…

**– 50ml Hemp rum**  
**– 100ml Pineapple Juice**  
**– 50 ml Coconut Cream**  
**– Lime Wedge**  
**– Ice**

Pop all your ingredients into a [cocktail](https://podcast.canex.co.uk/) shaker or blender with a little ice until mixed well. Pour over more ice and place another lime wedge on top. Enjoy!

Alternatively, if you’re not feeling so quite so bougie, you could just mix with regular coke and add a dash of lime. It’s just as good, trust me!

We get to review a lot of CBD/Hemp products here and we know that everybody notices the effects of them all so differently. What may work for one may not work for another. No one person’s experience mimics another. We do know one thing for sure though, we had a top night’s sleep and no hangover.

Say what you will but to us, that’s a solid win!

For those who want to catch up and can't find parts, or are interested! 🙏♥️","Main character Nin has three housemates and friends. Imogen Prairie,  Charlie (Kaz) Delacroix, and Rowan Beck, who are for some reason sensitive to the full moon. 

She is also having blackouts, blacking out full nights and chunks of her days, and feels like she's losing her mind. 

She began noticing it at a college party, watching her friends grow increasingly weirder, and in Rowan’s case, being a complete asshole and trying to avoid her. 

Under the full moon’s light, Kaz, a vegetarian, snacks on raw bacon– Imogen, who is scared of intimacy, is suddenly incredibly close to guys and girls, sitting on their laps, and Rowan, the usual nonchalant asshole type, is now a giggling fool following her around.

When she finds them seemingly hypnotised by the moon, standing on the doorstep, Nin is only more freaked out. 

The next day, she confronts the three of them, and they say it's a “sensitivity.” but seem oddly distant, refusing to tell her the reason. 

To combat this, the three insist on locking her in her room on a full moon until dawn, which she reluctantly agrees to. But when she wakes up, she starts to notice either her toes are missing, or not formed *yet*. 

Nin thinks she's going crazy, until she finds them feasting on her corpse in the kitchen, while playing monopoly. 

She runs away, and in her desperation to escape them, exposes them to the moon’s light, where they brutally kill themselves. She calls the police, only to find the three of them completely fine, and resuming their game of Monopoly. 

Again, Nin thinks she's losing it, but realizes Rowan has a number 2 carved into the back of his neck. 

She meanwhile, has a number twenty seven.

So, naturally, Nin runs the fuck away, because what the fuck. She finds solace in an old friend Sam Fuller, and his roommate Poppy, who she drifted away from. Sam appears to be playing a ‘board game’ with several town residents, but she doesn't fully see what he's actually playing. 

Sam invites her to his room, and Nin tells him a watered down version of what happened. She spends the next few weeks ignoring her housemates calls and texts, spending as much time with Sam as possible. Rowan crashes this party, however, seemingly moon-drunk in broad daylight, taunting Nin, and making a fool out of himself in front of other students. 

Sam and Rowan appear to know each other, with Rowan sarcastically mocking that Sam has published an article claiming he, Imogen, and Kaz are “evil, body snatching demons.”

Sam asks where Kaz is, hinting at something between the two. 

Rowan is an asshole back, and visibly distressed, Sam leaves, and Rowan mockingly apologizes for the other night, seemingly not knowing what happened. 

He drags her to his car, and she decides to go with him to find out what's going on. 

When Rowan breaks down and admits he likes the way she tastes, breaking his facade and telling her he hates her and what she *did*, it becomes clear that what is happening to her housemates is because of something she does not remember. 

She freaks out, and the two argue, with Rowan looking away from the road and crashing the car.

Nin wakes up severely injured, and after checking Rowan, who dies of his injuries, she too succumbs to hers. But she doesn't die, and is immediately spat back out, stitched back together, by what she describes as static remaking her body. 

This is her 29th body, and after coming to fruition, she briefly relives her last moments from her old body–including the argument and crash. 

Nin finds a brand new copied Rowan, an exact replica of the dead guy in the car wreck, and witnesses the exact and thing. Like her, his body is stitching itself back together. When he is solid, she attempts to pull him from the road, and is promptly hit in the back of the head, knocking her out. 

After remembering a brief tender moment in the car trunk with Rowan, with the two of them high on knock out drugs, Nin awakens back at home, to her confusion. She is inside her with Imogen, who is a screaming mess, barely comprehensible like she is possessed. 

Imogen explains she and the boys are *connected* through their emotions/feelings, and whatever they feel, she does too. She has felt them die multiple times, and it is slowly killing her, driving her crazy. Nin agrees to investigate the kidnappers, who took her and Rowan, and is currently holding the boys downstairs. 

Downstairs, she discovers the exact same group of people at Sam’s house– and Sam himself, torturing Rowan and Kaz. 

The leader taunts Imogen, who threatens to show them what they really are, and tells Nin to go to her room and lock herself inside. When Sam, who is actively torturing the boys, starts to cut into Kaz, after it's revealed that he and Kaz *had* something, Imogen snaps and tears away the protection on the windows, fully exposing the three of them to the moon. 

Without going into detail, the three of them fall completely under the moon’s spell, adapting feral-like characteristics, and rip Sam’s gang apart. When they start to hunt Nin down, she recalls Imogen earlier words, telling her to lock herself in the freezer in Rowan’s closet. 

With the three ready to brutally kill her, completely mindless zombie like creatures, Nin has no choice. Inside the closet are severed pieces of an earlier version of her, and when coming into contact with herself, she is able to see memories from this version of herself– which she blacked out. 

The memory shows her that several months ago, a mysterious woman showed up at the door asking for assistance. Rowan was suspicious, but Nin ignores him and lets her in. 

This woman is the leader of a cult, who knocks Rowan out, and drags the three of them down to their basement and gleefully explains their belief that skinning “outlines” from human beings under a full moon counts as an offering. 

She goes on to say thousands of years ago, the ancestors of the town rejected the sun– and the moon granted them abilities to shift their flesh into beasts. 

When they grew greedy, the moon abandoned then and cursed then with their outlines once again.

The cult can only sacrifice people from out of town, and believes Kaz, Imogen, and Rowan, are the ones who will bring the moon back. Nin selfishly tries to run and abandon them, and Rowan calls her out on her shit, calling her selfish and entitled, which she doesn't deny. 

He begs her not to leave them again, calling her out on ignoring Imogen’s sudden pregnancy several months earlier, and using them for her benefit. 

It comes apparent that their friendship wasn't as strong as perceived, and Rowan admits he has feelings for what he calls a selfish, entitled brat (ouch). 

He breaks down and begs her not to leave him (again). 

The cult leader, calling Nin out as being the one to abandon her friends, sacrifices Imogen and Kaz by plunging a dagger through their head.

She then forces Nin, who, controlled and influenced by the moon’s light and singing in her head, brutally kills Rowan.

When the sacrifice is completed, she actually witnesses the three’s outlines detach themselves from her friends, and attempt to flee. 

But they are killed too. With the three of them dead, the leader gleefully rejoices, calling them King's and Queen, and forces Nin to bow to them, dropping a crown of bone onto Rowan’s head. 

So, yes, people, this MAY be why he hates her so much. And I am completely on his side, you go KING (pun intended). 

So, Nin wakes up, still in Rowan’s freezer, and is pretty horrified. She didn't just abandon him, she brutally sacrificed him. 

The next morning the three are back to their usual selves. But there is a massacre in the living room, and Kaz and Rowan have no memories of the night before. 

Imogen does remember the first half, and tells Nin to keep it to herself. 

She also informs Nin the SUN IS GONE and there are some strange markings on her ceiling that don't appear to be English– and they conclude Rowan, Imogen and Kaz scrawled them while being under Moon™️. 

The sun is gone (but only in their town) It's dark outside at 9am and the moon is creeping up on them. 

Rowan lets slip that he told Nin about what they are and Kaz loses his fucking mind and then leaves to passive aggressively make bacon. 

Rowan keeps dropping hints about eating Nin (lol) and Imogen yells at him.

Nin, however, can maybe understand, since when they don't eat her, the three of them grow weaker and more animal-like. 

She gets a call from Poppy, Sam’s roommate, who asks her where Sam is. 

Sam is not one of the dead, which makes him a missing person. 

Nin takes a sleeping pill and let's them eat her. Guilt, I guess????? 

Wait, before that, Nin and Rowan have a moment when she tries to apologize, and he pushes her away. 

Following is what I thought was a stylistic approach, but it makes sense within the context of the story I think. 

We get a flash forward of a monotone world with no color. Nin is in a detached state, her mind completely broken apart, only repeating that she serves the Bolivia House royals. Nin is inside Sam’s old house watching her favorite TV show on a hollowed out TV with no screen. 

There are three children hiding behind the curtain. Lena, Jem, and Hanna, who are all apparently six months old. However, in Nina’s eyes they are more akin to young children (seven/eight years old). 

Jem has clearly been eating human flesh, his chin staines red. 

Nin ignores the children, and in a daze, watches her favorite show. 

The “show” is actually her watching herself and Rowan. Sitting on the roof, the two of them talk. Nin tries to apologize for what she did (good luck lol), and Rowan breaks down and basically tells her to go fuck herself. 

HOWEVER. In this state, she is able to rewind the “show” and tell him what she really feels. In this fantasy, they make a sort of truce, and in reality, Nin is demanding to know why he and the others left her alone. 

Back to the present (and one of my favorite scenes I've ever written, Nin is researching moon cycles in the college library. The sun is still gone, and students are understandably freaking out. 

While downloading a program that tracks the moon across the world, she overhears a conversation a group of her classmates are having, led by a girl, Maya, who confronts her about her housemates and their connection to the latest to go missing, Sam.

Sam and Kaz dated, and Sam wrote a scathing article about him, Imogen and Rowan, calling them evil body snatching demons. 

That article went semi viral, and now people are suspicious of her friends. 

ENTER Kaz and Rowan, who could not be acting more suspicious if they tried. 

After eating, these two are THRIVING, and are also very moon drunk, in a perpetual state of childish giggling. 

They are also suddenly glowing, literally, in the moons light, which entrances the entire student body in that room, Including Nin, and a bewitched girl who tries to throw herself at them.

Thankfully, the siren effect dies off, and Nin demands what the fuck they're doing, and they just laugh and say, “We’re fine, lmao we are all gooooood”. Kaz leaves to attend a town meeting that is definitely not a trap, and leaves Rowan and Nin alone. 

Rowan has actually been researching (surprisingly, since all this man does is yell and argue with people). He reveals, since he is partially transformed by the moon, he can read the ancient language scrawled on Nin’s ceiling, and translates it as, “The King's and Queen must be crowned to be complete.”

WOwW i wonder where this could be leading. 

Maya interrupts them, and pours a bottle of water all over Rowan's head (thank god he's not a mermaid). 

Maya accuses him of being a “beast” and killing Sam and the other missing students. She is dragged away, but it's clear the town is after the Bolivia House residents, who have killed the town council (the people at Sam’s house, and who tortured Kaz and Rowan). 

So, understandably, Rowan is a little freaked out. It starts to dawn on the two of them that Kaz just walked into a trap. Which was the town luring him there. 

They attempt to run home, but Rowan unknowingly steps directly into moonlight. 

Under the moon’s spell, she taunts Nin for not telling her housemates the truth about Sam. 

Then, he brutally kills and eats her multiple times, under the guise of the moon. So many times, that her mind  completely breaks, as her body is ripped apart and remade over and over again. 

Rowan drags Nin back to the house and down to the basement, where Kaz and Imogen are, also under the moon’s spell. Nin is introduced to Sam, who has been killed and lain out on a table, surrounded by fruit, as a feast. 

And in her state, yes, she starts to eat him too. 

Not before noticing a carving on his neck, hinting that Sam too can be copied. 

The cult rejoice, announcing that the full moon is officially upon them. 

Color is drained from her vision, and Nin watches Rowan officially crowned as a King, along with the others. 

And she is named their Stomach. 

Okay, so next, Nin’s mind is fully fucked. So, the next part is all in her head? Until the bedroom scene. That's when she snaps out of it. 

So, Nin’s mind spirals, and she finds herself reliving a memory of a house party, back when everything was pretty normal. She drinks with Imogen, but notices something is significantly wrong at the party. 

There's a rotting smell that won't go away, and people who should be dead, are  not (Sam). Rowan is in the kitchen and is looking for Kaz (like at the beginning of the story), but this time he is more playful and flirty. 

Since he’s human, and not holding a HUGE grudge, Rowan is back to being extremely loveable and insufferable with his pretentious attitude. They find Kaz hanging out with Sam, instead of what plays out at the beginning, with them immediately being hypnotised by the moon. 

Despite knowing something is wrong (seeing blood on her hands, all over her) Nin and Rowan get extremely drunk, and she drags him onto the dance floor.

Nin realizes her feelings for him, and it's a sad “What if” if the moon never affected him, maybe they would have become something more. 

The two almost hook up, but Nin manages to snap out of it upon realising what is happening around her is a fantasy, and comes back to reality inside the Bolivia House basement, facing three thrones made of human remains. 

Nin recalls the last six months (yes, there's been a six month time jump) where her housemates, now classes as royals and rulers of the town, have essentially been playing games with her, hunting her down and eating her, and sending her fully spiraling. 

So, yeah, she's not very stable right now. 

However, she is roused by Rowan’s voice, who appears to be back to normal. Sitting on his throne and wearing his crown, he is noticeably distressed (I'm not surprised, that man has a crown quite literally melded to his skull). 

He begs her not to leave him, and this time our girl does not (character development, we we love her) and the two share a moment. Nin tries to pull off his crown, but can't–before the cult leader herself enters, and orders Rowan to sit back down on his throne. 

No longer under the moon’s spell, he tells this woman to go fuck herself (king), before a newly brainwashed Kaz follows the cult woman's instructions and rips his head off and his newly copied body is dragged away to be *re-educated* in the cult woman's words. I originally wrote “moon lobotomy” and couldn't stop laughing, so I changed it). But rest assured, it IS a moon lobotomy. 

The cult leader apologizes for Rowan’s behavior, and creepily asks Nin if she knows where her grandchildren are. 

Nin leaves the town hall (fashioned to look like Bolivia House) and discovers the town in ruins, with half of the population turned into beasts, or dead, and this was all her housemate's (I'm a Kaz, rowan and Immie defender, but I can't defend this guys, what the fuck). Nin arrives back at an empty Bolivia house, where she finds a photo of herself holding a baby. 

Which she does not remember. She is then knocked out by presumably her housemate's, who appear to be the versions she originally sacrificed. (Imogen has a knife through her head). 

Okay, the next part is from Rowan’s POV, and is just him suffering. 

I am tired, but in the words of Mario, let's a go. 

Rowan is being held, chained up in the town hall basement, and so far, every attempt to “re-educate” him has failed, due to him being extremely stubborn, clinging onto his human side despite him also shifting into a monster.

Kaz, completely brainwashed and all for his bro’s moon lobotomy, enters, and Rowan flashes back to when the two first met. He was a frat bro and Kaz saved from humiliating himself, the two instantly connecting. He also admits that he fell for Kaz at first sight. 

Presently, Kaz who is a brainwashed king (a literal king, not a yaass king) asks Rowan if he remembers his first death, which catapults Rowan's mind back, where he remembers first meeting Nin. 

He, Kaz, and Imogen were driving back from Kaz’s father’s house, and a dazed looking girl who is barefoot and wearing a long white dress jumps into the middle of the road. 

When they try to help her, she snaps at them and thinks they're trying to kidnap her, and punches Rowan in the nose. She runs away before they can question her. 

The NEXT day, guess who's their new housemate? 

Rowan and Nini (yes, she was originally Nini) instantly clash, following her recognizing him, and him being suspicious of her. Imogen doesn't help by introducing him as a pretentious sex addict. This isn't exactly false, as Rowan is pansexual, so he falls in love with and has sex with anyone he forms an attachment with. 

So he, Kaz and Imogen do have a relationship that he wants to actually label, while they see it more as roommates-with-benefits. Rowan is jealous of Nin getting close to the others, and in his attempt to make sure she doesn't get near them, he makes the mistake of getting too close to her. 

He denies liking her, sure, but it's clear when he wakes up in Nini’s bed, that he's broken his own rules. 

However, things take a sharp turn when he notices the pictures of the moon on her walls, and photos of people with their eyes scratched out. Then he realizes he's drugged. Rowan manages to stumble downstairs and to the door, before Nin grabs him, threatening him with a knife. She has tied up Imogen and Kaz. 

Rowan is torn from the memory, accusing the moon of filling his head with fake memories, and twisting Nin to appear antagonistic. However, the moon offers a deal. She will show him the truth of his first death, if he accepts his role as a King, and his crown. By now, Rowan is very close to fully shifting, and his sanity is slipping. He accepts. 

The memory returns in full, and he witnesses his first death. He is shot in the chest and killed, with Imogen and Kaz. 

Nin drags his body to the town lake, and begs the moon to bring them back, sacrificing her own memories. This fully breaks Rowan, and he loses his mind, gleefully letting the moon pick his mind apart, and accepting his crown, and finally transforming. In my notes, it just says, “Rowan fucking dies for the third time).”

There's a final memory of his, as his mind just kind of breaks. 

This time, we see that first night at the party (from the beginning of the story) from his POV, where he knows exactly what Nin did to him and the others, and what he has to do to survive. 

This is also the first time he experiences  the moon’s spell. 

Kaz is the first affected, catching the reflection of the moon in his drink, before disappearing to tell Sam he is **dead**. 

Rowan does actually run into Sam, who is oddly worried about him. He demands what was wrong with him the other night, claiming Rowan called out for help when he visited the house. Rowan is confused, having no memory of this interaction. Sam asks if she [Nin] has turned him into a “Devil”.

Again, Rowan is confused. Sam and Nin are best friends, so he's baffled why Sam is acting like he does not know her. Rowan ignores him and heads over to Nin, asking where Kaz is. Imogen tells him through a  text there is something wrong with Kaz, and to shut all blinds and curtains. 

Imogen drags him away from Nin, and the two of them find Kaz standing on the doorstep, staring up at the moon, before Rowan too falls under the moon’s spell for the very first time. He is aware of Nin trying to get his attention, but can't answer. 

Okay, so the final, most recent part. 

So, Rowan is brainwashed, re-eduacted, completely out of his fucking mind, gleefully torturing Nin as the moon’s King, and the towns new ruler. 

He tells her that he only asked the moon one thing, and that was to allow him to make her suffer. Because in his head, the cult twisted his brain into thinking she is the reason why he is like this, and SHE turned him into this. Now, both the King and the moon plan to use Nina’s body. 

But it's not clear what for. 

Rowan asks Nin how he died, and forces her to relive her memories, and what has been blocked out. 

What she sacrificed to bring him back. 

She is brought back to memories of a boy who was pulled from her memories. Jonas, her twenty year old brother. 

It is revealed that when she was sixteen, Nin, her mother, and her brother crashed their car and were saved by a group of people, who turned out to be a cult, and regularly sacrifice people in hopes of bringing the moon’s light back to the town, and back to the so-called old ways. 

While their mother falls under the cult’s brainwashing tactics, Nin and Jonas rebel. When she is twenty two, Jonas is named as the next sacrifice, and to save him, she believes bringing in replacements will allow her and Jonas to escape the cult, and their abusive mother. 

Jonas interestingly points out that the moon Can be removed from a vessel/human body, but does not say *how*. 

So, we circle back to Rowan’s memories– but this time from Nin’s perspective. 

The moon was in fact NOT lying, and Nin has been manipulating and luring the Bolivia House residents from the start. BUT there's one small problem. 

Nin didn't think she would fall for them. She's been trapped in a cult since she was 17, and finally being in part of a semblance of a family, her barriers start to come down, and against her wishes, she starts to fall for Rowan, and finally has a normal life with the three of them– so much so that she partially forgets her goal. 

So, when Jonas calls her and tells her his sacrifice is in the next few days, she breaks apart and snaps, holding the Bolivia House residents captive, in preparation for the ceremony. 

Nin is getting increasingly torn between wanting to save these people, and kill them to save her brother. She is instructed to remove their hearts, and deliver them to the cult, in three days. 

Nin does everything she is told, carving the moon’s words (the moon language, meaning to seal her light inside them) into their skin, and trying to explain that what is going to happen is beautiful (we love a delusional queen 😍). 

Rowan, after being seduced and manipulated by her, despises her and himself for trusting and letting his barriers fall. Sam visits, and Nin answers the door, telling him Kaz is sick. 

When Rowan cries out for help, Nin forces him to tell Sam everytHING is fINe and Rowan does, with a gun to his head. 

After giving an Oscar Award Winning performance, Sam still doesn't believe him, so Nin tells him Kaz never wants to see him again. 

(This is what motivates him to write the scathing article, and join the hunters– which we see at the start of the story) 

Sam leaves. Nin notices Rowan is paying close attention to her gun, and is immediately on guard. Kaz asks if he can make them all a home cooked meal before they die, and Nin surprisingly agrees. She frees Rowan and insists on a shopping trip to get ingredients. But just the two of them. 

Kaz and Imogen are locked inside the house. The car ride there is awkward. By this point, Rowan is extremely vulnerable and not himself. 

He demands to know WHY she is doing this, and after letting it slip that she’s not doing this because she wants to hurt him, Nin stays stubbornly silent, threatening him with her gun (this is funny considering what happens later on in the chapter hahahaHA) 

Inside a 7/11, Nin is grabbing ingredients for the perfect last supper. 

She is searching for Imogen’s favorite oat milk when Rowan appears with a basket full of groceries, and a cake for a thirteen year old. He hesitantly asks her if she is doing this by choice, and to his disdain, she says yes, and tells him she IS going to kill him, and IS going to offer him to the full moon. 

And that is her choice. 

She also tells him to put the birthday cake back, because he will be dead long before he gets to eat it. 

Unsurprisingly, Rowan does not take this well, snatches the cake back and buys it himself. 

He also tries and fails to drop hints to the cashier, who just does not care. In the car on the way home, Rowan loses it and tries to crash the car, before revealing it is his 22nd birthday, and he doesn't want to die. The two share a small moment when he calms down, and asks her how she celebrates her birthday, and Nin says she doesn't. Rowan, bro, dude, my boi. 

This girl is NOT WORTH IT… 

When they do get home, Rowan finally disarms Nin, and reveals the gun was never loaded. 

Freeing the others, he demands to know why she's really doing this, and Nin breaks down and tells them the truth. 

To her confusion, all three of them don't decide to turn her into the cops (why? Plot), and want to help her save her brother from the cult. Nin needs three human hearts for the offering ceremony, so Kaz gets three pig hearts, since they are similar in anatomy. 

Nin takes the fake hearts to meet her mother, but finds her already sacrificed brother instead. She breaks apart, and believes herself to be alone in the world, since Jonas is now dead, and there is no escape from her mother. 

Rowan finds her, and tells her they can walk away and not look back. 

Kaz and Imogen join in, and they share a group hug. They take her back home, and finally officially welcome her as a permanent housemate in Bolivia House. 

I wish I could end it here, but if I did, there would be no story– and the above plot wouldn't matter. 

Okay, so. We are brought back to reality, where Nin is being pretty horrifically tortured by a brainwashed Rowan, who is picking through her brain. 

He once again asks her to answer how he died– and she finally sees it. On the doorstep of Bolivia house, she witnesses Kaz and Imogen shot in the head by members of the cult that have hunted them down. Rowan is shot too, but this time, fatally, in the heart. 

With him dying in her arms, Nin makes the painful decision to finally submit to her mother. She dumps their bodies in the trunk of Kaz’s car, and drives them to the town lake. 

Bear in mind, Rowan is still dying. Nin carved the moon’s ritual words into the dirt, and carves out their hearts (not before sharing a kiss with Rowan, before he dies), and promising them she will bring them back.

Nin talks to the moon after dumping Kaz and Imogen into the lake, and the moon tentatively asks if she can shape them in any way she wants– and if Nin allows her to, then she can live the life she has always craved, sacrificing her memories of the cult and her brother, and everything she has done, for peace. 

Nin agrees, and following the moon’s request for Rowan’s body, slips him into the water too. The river lights up, the moon fades, and Nin is left confused as to why she is sitting on the edge of the river bank in the early hours of the morning. 

Imogen greets her, informing her the four of them have been “moon-watching”. 

The two head back to the car where Rowan and Kaz are, and on their way back home, Rowan comments on the coffee he's drinking as bitter and hard to swallow. Kaz agrees, also struggling to drink the coffee. When Nin tries it, however, she can taste nothing wrong. 

She also notices Rowan’s teeth are slightly sharper than normal. 

Rowan remarks on being really fucking *hungry*, and THAT is how it all starts.. 

Explanation: by offering their hearts to the moon, Nin opened Pandora’s box, allowing the moon cult to come along, and officially carve their outlines, which we saw in earlier parts, and finish the ceremony. 

This time, however, she is completely oblivious of what she, essentially, started). Following this, we have the beginning of the story, the housemates with no choice but to eat Nin to survive and in this partially transformed state, and Rowan holding this grudge against her). 

Presently, Nin comes to, with all her memories back, to her housemates completely brainwashed, eating her alive, and her mother, the leader of the cult, watching on. 

However, Nin has her memories back now, and knowing the cult practises and her mother, she knows how to kill her housemates, as well as the moon’s reign. 

But will she? 🙏♥️",3,1732973845.0,u_Trash_Tia,0,1.0,False

I (37m) divorced a few years ago and only got back into dating over the past few months. My preference for the few dates I’ve had have all been a coffee/tea morning date on the weekend so we could chat a bit to see if there is any connection there and then go our separate ways to enjoy the rest of the day. Low pressure, no expectations and easy. 

I’m in touch with someone interesting who declined the morning date and asked instead for a weekday after work evening meetup since they were busy this weekend. Of course the first things that come to my mind are dinner and/or drinks. I don’t drink but for health reasons, I have no issue being in a bar. But prefer not to do dinner on a first date in case it’s not going great, it seems like a bad idea to have to get through a longer meal. It’s also winter time so not the best season to go for an evening stroll.

I’m wondering, is it alright to try and just get drinks (I’d get something non alcoholic) and not do dinner? And if so, what time is appropriate (ie they can eat first) but not too late since it’s a work day)?

I know people go for just drinks all the time - I’m just out of practice.

I would really like to lose as much body fat possible by the end of December to just get it over with before going back home

I honestly feel fine and I feel like my body can just feed from my body fat and use that for energy since I have so much extra now, will it really impact how my nose heals that much though or something else with my body I’m not aware of? If not fasting I guess I could do just a really low calorie deficit w protein, but it just feels so much easier and simple to just do a water fast because it’s harder for me to eat minimal amounts of food in moderation- it just makes me want to eat more and it’s easier for me to just go cold turkey and start fasting. Perhaps there are even some benefits I could get from fasting that would even help me rebuild tissue or with swelling

For some words it's pretty straightforward. Words with the letter ⟨o⟩ in them are often pronounced with the cot vowel and words with ⟨aw⟩, ⟨al⟩, ⟨augh⟩, ⟨ough⟩ etc. are usually pronounced with the caught vowel.

caught vowel:

* caught: /cɑt/ with the merger, /cɔt/ without
* bought: /bɑt/ with the merger, /bɔt/ without
* chalk: /t͡ʃɑk/ with the merger, /t͡ʃɔk/ without

cot vowel:

* cot: /kɑt/ in both cases
* nod: /nɑd/ in both cases
* dot: /dɑt/ in both cases

With other words, this rule doesn't work at all:

* coffee: /ˈkɑ.fi/ with the merger, /ˈkɔ.fi/ without
* collar: /ˈkɑ.ləɹ/ in both cases
* dog: /dɑɡ/ with the merger, /dɔɡ/ without
* fog: /fɑɡ/ with the merger, /fɔɡ/ without
* pot: /pɑt/ with the merger, /pɔt/ without

It looks like there probably isn't any orthographic rule to distinguish them. How would one go about learning the pronunciation of these words in US accents without the cot-caught merger? Is it even possible to classify them like this? Or will there always be some regional variation that does things differently? Like for example, maybe there's some regional pronunciation that treats ⟨not⟩ as the cought vowel situation pronouncing it /nɔt/. I know it doesn't really matter that much for a foreigner to speak well and be understood. I'm just curious about this phenomenon and want to know more about how this works.",2,1732973265.0,ENGLISH,1,1.0,False

I have a lot of experience in the DIY/punk scene as well as in other genres, and am very open to experimentation. I am making this post as I have amassed a good amount of material for guitar and I would like to collaborate with others whether it’s guitar, vocals, etc. I am also a writer and poet but so far I have not been able to figure out lyrics for anything. I do not necessarily want someone to help write my songs; actually I am making this post to ask if there are other musicians in the area who wouldn’t mind presenting and being presented with material and just jamming and fleshing things out. The style I seem to play in is a mix within the ranges of folk, John frusciante style guitar, Elliott smith. The last two are more inspirational but that’s kinda how my music comes across. Also have always admired the experimental spirit of early Animal Collective. I do not have a car but transportation *around the city* is not a problem. If you want to meet up sometime at a park or downtown and play or talk shop I’m down. I don’t usually go out to eat or coffee but I don’t mind if others do. So if you wanna make some music and are open adaptive patient but most importantly just want to make some music I ask you to reach out!

1h3c7pf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPylori/comments/1h3c7pf/h_pylori_negative_healing_timeline/,H. Pylori Negative ---- Healing timeline ,"Hello. I'm going to share my story and the progression of symptoms in case it helps someone/calms their anxiety.

I wrote down my symptoms during treatment, so none of this is misremembering.

**Initial Symptoms**

\- Severe thumping stomach pain after I ate

\- I lost 10kg

\- Acid reflux + regurgitation that one choked me while I was asleep

\- Bloating

\- Nausea

\- Constipation

\- Couldn't stomach certain foods (anything fried, any diary products, anything too fibrous, or coffee)

I couldnt be bothered with my doctor so I ordered the test myself. It returned positive. So I started taking **(Clarithromycin + Tinidazole + Omeprazole) for 14 days**

***Treatment***

**Day 1-3:** The PPI relieved the pain and acid reflux, but I had severe depression. It was tough. Almost hurt myself

**Day 4-6:** My depression went away on it's own, but I had cold symptoms (runny nose, weakness, fatigue)

**Day 7-10**: Stomachache came back, but milder

**Day 11-14**: No symptoms whatsoever

I took a PPI (Pantoprazole) for 2 weeks after the treatment just in case.

***Post treatment***

**Week 1:** Felt like everything came back. Stomach pain, acid reflux, etc. I got so depressed and spiraled into thinking it was cancer or IBS. (Spoiler: It wasn't)

**Week 2:** New symptoms appeared. Bloating, gas, and severe, painful belching.

This is when I started eating/drinking whatever I wanted. The pain/bloating afterwards was mild enough.

**Week 3-4:** No original H. Pylori symptoms (no reflux, pain, depression, nor constipation), but my bloating got really bad. I'd look 6 months pregnant after drinking water. And sometimes I'd choke on my own belches.

I started drinking a probiotic milk (kinda similar to kefir, but less effective), so idk if that helped. You be the judge. Also, whenever I bloated I'd take Gas-X and it'd relieve it

**Week 5:** One by one, my symptoms started getting better. Bloating was less common, belching completely disappeared, the mild pain was once every 10 days instead of daily.

**Week 6:** Complete relief. I feel like a veil was taken off me. I feel like my old self again, and I'm no longer afraid to eat.

***Other***

\- I never once took a probiotic, except the milk I mentioned

\- I tested and it returned negative, but I forgot when. Must've been 5 or 6 days ago

\- I took PPI for 2 weeks after treatment

\- I've been symptom free for 12 days before I posted this, just to make sure it wasn't one good day

\- I eat anything I want",1,1732972053.0,HPylori,0,1.0,False
1h3c7jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1h3c7jc/nine_weeks_four_days_sober/,Nine weeks four days sober,"Hi everyone, my goal is not to drink for 100 days. By then, I figured that I would feel so much better that I would continue not to drink, or to drink occasionally in good company.

According to my calendar, I will hit 100 days on January 2 2025. The holiday season presents challenges, particularly New Year's Eve. I normally attend a large dinner party where copious amounts of Champagne, white wine and port are inbibed. There is no way I can attend and not drink without this becoming a topic of discussion (traditionally, everyone gets quite tipsy). As NYE is just 2 days before I hit my goal of 100 days, I've decided to skip the dinner party.

In these past nine weeks I've noticed that some of my friends expect me to drink. It's a bit uncomfortable because they want a few glasses of wine (we used to share a bottle or two at these lunches) but if I am declining to drink, they are only comfortable having one glass.

I find it difficult to assert myself with some of my friends in this area, particularly at this time of year. My solution has been to meet them for coffee, to go for a walk (or windowshopping in town). I miss my friends but will not be confronted by their poorly-concealed suspicion of my choice of obviously non-alcoholic beverages.

I welcome any advice and suggestions so I can get to January 2, 2025 sober.",4,1732972035.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

As developers with over 10 years of experience, we’ve faced the same challenges many of you have when trying to promote apps on the App Store. 🎯 App Store Optimization (ASO) is essential, but the tools we found were either too complex or too expensive for indie developers like us.  
  
🌍 [ASO.dev](http://ASO.dev) is quite the traveler!  
  
ASO.dev’s journey has been nothing short of extraordinary. It all began in Bali 🇮🇩, the day after Julia's birthday, when we bought the domain and started building something special. From there, our adventure spanned countries, milestones, and countless cups of coffee:  
🇻🇳 The first website came to life in Vietnam.  
🇹🇭 Most of the first version’s code was crafted in Thailand (Phuket).  
🇰🇿 We launched the first version and registered the company in Kazakhstan.  
🇬🇪Our marketing efforts kicked off from Georgia.  
  
This project has collected more stamps in its passport than some of us, but it’s not about being digital nomads. It’s about building a dream—one line of code, one city at a time. Sometimes, we even had to write code outside waiting hours for an Airbnb to be ready (true build-in public, right?).  
  
Fast forward to today, we’re celebrating one year in Serbia 🇷🇸, where everything has started falling into place. The technical hurdles? Overcome. The legal complexities? Sorted. Even the tricky SSL certificate issues for Windows? Fixed! [ASO.dev](http://ASO.dev) is finally the product we dreamed of. We’re super excited to show it to you!  
  
💡 Why We Built [ASO.dev](http://ASO.dev)  
One of the key struggles we faced as indie developers was filling in the ""What’s New"" section for all locales. It was tedious, time-consuming, and frustrating. We realized there had to be a better way—so we built [ASO.dev](http://ASO.dev) to make ASO easier, faster, and affordable without compromising on features.  
  
🚀 Why ASO.dev?  
🛠 All-in-One ASO Tool  
Track UNLIMITED keywords, analyze competitors, edit metadata, and even automate ""What’s New"" updates across multiple locales—all from one platform.

>[$1000](https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/?f=flair_name%3A%22%241000%22)

>And by picky, I mean... he just has limited interests and virtually no interest in material things for the most part. We're big travelers but most of my vacation time is accounted for next year already. I'm stuck.

>He did make a request for a boudoir photoshoot but that is so far out of my comfort zone. I feel guilty for this but at the same time, I don't feel like this is something I can actually do for him.

I understand how tricky it can be to find something special for a husband who's picky and not really into material things. You're in a bit of a unique situation, especially when you're a couple who loves to travel but have limited vacation time next year.

Let’s break this down so we can find some memorable, unique, and thoughtful gifts that speak to your bond, your husband's interests, and make him feel loved and appreciated without having to step into something uncomfortable for you like the boudoir photoshoot. Here are a few ideas for gifts that fall under $1000, but are still impactful:

# 1. Private Travel Experience: Customized Travel Itinerary or Private Tour

* Since you both love traveling, even though vacation time is limited, you can give him the gift of a **customized travel experience**. If you can't take an extended vacation, maybe you can plan a surprise weekend getaway to a destination he's interested in. You could also consider a **private tour** in a nearby city, where you have a guide who focuses on something he's passionate about—whether it's history, culture, food, or something more niche.
* A local vineyard, distillery tour, or a scenic hiking experience could be perfect for a unique day trip you can enjoy together.
* **Example**: Customizable day tours or weekend getaway packages. Check experiences on platforms like **Airbnb Experiences** or **Viator**.

# 2. A High-End Memory Box for Travel Souvenirs

* This could be an incredibly personal gift that combines a sense of nostalgia and value. You could design a **high-end leather memory box** for your travels together. You can fill it with little mementos like travel tickets, postcards, or even written notes about your favorite memories. It's a way of appreciating your past adventures and a nudge to look forward to more in the future.
* You could even **personalize it** with his initials or a phrase that holds sentimental value.

# 3. Experience-Based Gifts (Non-Material, High-Impact)

* Consider gifting **experiences** that don't involve physical objects. This could be a **masterclass**, a **cooking class**, or a **wine tasting** event.
* A **masterclass** subscription from someone like Gordon Ramsay (for cooking), or a specialized skill he’s interested in (photography, writing, etc.) would be a great way to engage his mind.
* **Example**: Check out online experience providers like **MasterClass** or **Airbnb Experiences** for unique adventures, or even **cooking experiences** from local chefs.

# 4. Custom Art or Portraits

* If he's not into material things, why not give him something intangible yet deeply personal? You could commission a **custom piece of artwork** or a **hand-drawn illustration** that represents something important to both of you. This could be a drawing of your favorite vacation destination, a custom illustration of a memorable moment between you two, or even a stylized family portrait.
* Since you mentioned the boudoir photoshoot, this is something you can still creatively adapt to make it feel comfortable for you—perhaps a **subtle intimate art piece** or a **unique gift** like a framed photo of a beautiful moment between the two of you, captured in a simple but elegant way.

# 5. VIP Access to Something Special

* **VIP tickets to a concert**, a private showing, or an **exclusive event** could be a fantastic way to surprise him with an experience he’ll love. Even if he's not big on material things, this would appeal to his sense of unique experiences.
* If he has a favorite band, comedian, or hobby, you could get tickets to an event that he wouldn't normally attend.

# 6. Custom Luxury Travel Gear

* Since you both travel, you could invest in **luxury travel gear**—but not in the typical material way. Think about a **custom, monogrammed leather travel set** (luggage tags, a passport holder, and a travel wallet), or a high-end **travel pillow** or **noise-canceling headphones**.
* **Amazon Link Idea**: Here’s a link for monogrammed leather travel accessories you might like: [Leather Passport Holder & Travel Wallet](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=leather+passport+holder+travel+wallet&tag=gifts-favspro-20).

# 7. The ""One Funnel Away"" Challenge for Entrepreneurs

* If your husband is entrepreneurial or has any business interests, you could gift him a spot in the **One Funnel Away Challenge**—it’s a program designed to help anyone launch a business with digital marketing, and it could spark something exciting for him if he’s looking to explore new projects or interests.
* You can find more info about it here: [One Funnel Away Challenge](https://bit.ly/4e9n3CY).

# 8. Personalized Video Message from a Celebrity (or Someone He Looks Up To)

* Another unique idea could be getting a **personalized video message** from someone he admires. There are services where you can request **celebrity video messages** (via platforms like **Cameo**).
* If he’s a fan of a particular actor, athlete, or influencer, you could arrange for them to wish him a Happy Birthday or congratulate him on something.

# 9. A Subscription to Something That Engages His Interests

* Even though your husband isn’t into material things, a **subscription box** tailored to his interests could still be a great choice. Whether it’s something related to books, fine wines, fitness, or tech gadgets, he may enjoy the surprise of receiving something every month.
* Check out **Nomad Box** (travel-inspired items) or **Atlas Coffee Club** (worldwide coffee tasting experience).

# 10. A Unique Outdoor Adventure Experience

* This could be anything from a **hot air balloon ride** to a **private sailing tour**, or even a **helicopter ride** to see your city from above. These types of unique experiences are often more about the memory than material things and would align with his love for experiences over stuff.

# 11. Customized 3D Map of a Special Place

* A personalized **3D map** of a place that’s special to the two of you (the city you met, favorite vacation spot, etc.) can be a stunning and sentimental gift. It’s something you can display in your home as a reminder of your shared history.

I hope one of these ideas resonates with you! What do you think of these? Would any of these options feel like a good fit for your husband's personality and your relationship?

Thanksgiving — 1942  
Milwaukee

By KETA STEEBS

Doris and I had been living in Milwaukee less than six months when we glumly faced the prospects of spending our first family-type holiday away from home. Doris (my still favorite cousin) was 18 and I was 17. Because of her advanced age, she was able to earn a princely hourly wage inspecting airplane parts in a defense plant while I, nine months her junior, was relegated to mixing Walgreen malts for $11 a week (meals, uniforms and pencils deducted.)

We had left home the day after graduation, she carrying a handsome set of matched luggage and me saddled with a $7 Spiegel cardboard suitcase which my mother had packed six weeks earlier. Few tears were shed on either side (I had wrecked the rear axle of my father’s car Baccalaureate night) and I cooly informed both parents as they nudged me out the door, I would not be home until I had made my fame and fortune or owned a decent suitcase — whichever came first.

“You won’t see me for a year,” I yelled out the window of second cousin Leonard’s car. “Don’t expect us to come home for any dumb holidays.”

Doris, who left on better terms, agreed with me. All Thanksgiving and Christmas were, we told each other, nothing but a pain. There were always about 40 relatives sitting around in an overheated house, chewing about us kids, eating too much, piling up dishes for us to wash, and, in general, making a nuisance of themselves. Now, that we were on our own, we’d never be bossed around again.

Milwaukee in the early 40’s was to us the most beautiful city in the world (neither of us had been farther south than Green Bay) and we couldn’t get over our good fortune in being allowed to live there.

I can still see us; slender Doris in her blue and white striped ‘seersucker two-piecer and chubby me in my dipsy-doodle dirndl riding the number 10 streetcar on our daily job hunts. Every ride was an adventure into the unknown and as long as our graduation present money lasted, we couldn’t resist exploring our adopted home. By investing in a pass, we could ride all over the city for a dollar a week and I still think one reason the streetcar transit system went broke was our habit of rarely relinquishing a seat once we got on. For the first 10 days we perched behind the bored driver (the better to ask questions) for at least eight hours straight.

On the 11th day, having enjoyed our fill of the scenery (and making a nervous wreck of the motorman) we went our separate ways. Vowing not to return until gainful employment had been obtained, Doris headed north to the factories and I rode south to the stockyards. Unskilled, too young to get past the personnel desk in most places, I had high hopes of being employed by Mr. Plankington. His only requirement, as stated in a 3-line want ad, was that applicants be tall — a stipulation my 5’ 9” admirably fulfilled.

Unfortunately, the odor emanating from Mr. Plankington’s packing plant turned my complexion green before my name was ever called. As long as I retained my sense of smell, I could never work in a stockyard — hence my malt making career. Doris, in the meantime, had no trouble being hired by Mr. Briggs and Mr. Stratton.

By the time Thanksgiving rolled around, all either of us could do was think of taking life easy. I was working a double eight hour shift (without the knowledge or consent of the Wisconsin Industrial Commission) and Doris was putting in her share of overtime. Besides, in what little spare time we had we liked to chase around with fellows.

Our Thanksgiving Day plans consisted of staying in bed until noon, dressing up in our red sloppy joe sweaters and knife-pleated plaid skirts (topped with our snappy, double-breasted - navy blue reefers) and going to a fancy restaurant for a late dinner.

In those days a late dinner meant anything served after 12 o’clock noon and a fancy restaurant was a place where you could eat without first scraping egg yolk off the fork.

We knew of such a place, handily located a few blocks from our rooming house. Bearing the intriguing name “Patches,” it had a reputation for quantity (always, of more concern to us than quality) and with its red and white checked cafe curtains and oilcloth covered tables promised a certain amount of homelike atmosphere. Patches’ Thanksgiving Day menu, scotchtaped to the door, offered family style servings of turkey, trimmings and dessert for 99 cents. (No tax).

However, by the last Thursday in November, 1942, neither of us had the 99 cents. We had spent so much money spiffing up for Thanksgiving, we had little left for food. In fact, our combined finances came to less than a dollar.

Doris, as usual, was the more affluent. She had something like 60 cents and I had three dimes and one Indian Head penny.

Determined to have turkey we explained our predicament to Mrs. Patches who said it would be impossible to serve two dinners for 91 cents but she would fix us each a turkey, gravy and mashed potato plate lunch for 40 cents apiece including coffee (which Doris never drank) and a sliver of pumpkin pie.

We sat facing each other across the peeling oilcloth. “No sweet potatoes, Keta,” Doris whispered (she knew how I loved them, “no fruit salad, homemade rolls, cabbage salad, cranberries, relishes, jello, creamed peas or ice cream on our pie. Just plain old mashed potatoes, turkey and gravy, that’s all we’re getting. Cousin Hartley’s eating better than us.” (Cousin Hartley was in the army).

“They’re eating better in Waupun for that matter,” I told her as we tried eating around the lumps in the gravy. “What do we have to do to go to jail?”

We finished our meal in silence, not bothering to wait for the pie. By the time we had swallowed the last strand of stringy turkey, we couldn’t blame the lumps in our throats on the gravy. All we could think of (although neither would mention it) was the groaning board at home.

“There’s more food left on Ma’s dirty dishes than on Mrs. Patches’ 40 cent luncheon,” Doris remarked ruefully as we tramped down deserted Wells st. Faced with the prospect of spending an entire afternoon and evening in our solitary room, we made each other a solemn promise — a promise I still remember.

“We’ll never spend a holiday away from home again,” we vowed. And as long as Doris and I were together we never did.

I had a really really terrible diet and I am trying to eat better. I used to have junk food 3-4 times a week easily, sometimes even more. I am trying to cook more often but it’s difficult. The below is the realistic version of weekly diet I am trying to have. how can it be improved? I am a picky eater, so there’s a lot of food I wouldn’t eat.

Breakfast

Usually skip with just coffee everyday

Corn cereals or a simple pastry 2-3 times a week

Lunch

Sandwich for 2-3 day. Hams, cheese, 

Dunch(lunch+dinner. I often have just one real meal a day)

2 days - Tomato sauce(from supermarkets) pasta with mushrooms, onions, asparagus, carrots, aubergine

2 days - Smoked Salmon or canned tuna, with rice, kimchi, onions, mushrooms

2 days - pasta salad, or pasta with salad, with chicken breasts

or
1-2 days Instant ramen/noodles with mushrooms, and rice and canned tuna.

1 day - eating out. Kebabs or burgers usually. or Asian food like noodles.

Basically I “cook” but it’s barely cooking and I make the simplest food you can imagine and I don’t even use eggs because it’s too much work… :/

I sometimes have bananas because it’s easy to peel off and eat, but because it spoils too quickly I don’t eat it often. Other than the mixed salad veges, mushrooms and onions I don’t buy fresh food because they spoil so quickly. I don’t even buy milk often.

I promised I would share my story with you guys if that happened so here it is!!! I just want to brag about how JoJo and I share the same brain. I wrote this back in August and we didn't even have BTS pics from KantBison in the bowling alley. 😅

Story: (Bring me to) Neverland
Genre: Romance
Inspiration: Peter Pan
Characters: 
Pete: 32 years old junior associate lawyer. Fun, outgoing
Captain: 32 year old associate lawyer. A couple of his cases were widely reported in the news. He’s like a celebrity among his peers 
Red: 33 years old associate lawyer
Dee: 35 years old associate lawyer, she's worked the longest at the Firm 
Belle: she’s 25 year old, a paralegal 
Sam: 32 year old associate lawyer, Captain’s best friend at the firm
Bill: part of the pirates’s team, he’s Captain’s  friend from highschool
Sky: part of the pirates’s team, he’s Captain’s  friend from highschool
Star: Sky’s sister
Darling: she’s 60, she started the International Law Firm with George
George: He’s an American immigrant running the Neverland bowling alley. 

Pete is a very competent attorney that is moving to Bangkok to start working in a very prestigious international law firm as an associate lawyer. He’s the kind of person that needs at least 3 coffees before 10 am to function properly. When he arrives at the law firm’s building, coffee cup in hand, he runs for the elevator but misses it while a young man inside closes the door on him with a cheeky smile. He calls another elevator and while waiting, another person stands next to him. It’s Captain, an associate lawyer for the Firm Pete is joining. Pete knows of him because he’s famous for being ruthless in court and he’s won big cases for the company that have reached the news. Captain is checking a dossier and barely notices Pete. They both enter the elevator and go for the same button. That’s when Captain sees Pete who smiles at him and makes a joke about going to the same place. Captain doesn’t acknowledge him and keeps checking his file. When the door opens, Pete goes for The Reception desk while Captain keeps walking while everyone he crosses greets him by name.
At the Reception desk, Pete meets Lily who is the receptionist and welcomes him to the firm. She gives him a badge, some documents he needs to fill, asks for his birthday so they can buy him cake (she shows him the birthday list of the people that work there) and finally lets him know he is expected at the main boardroom and gives him directions to find it. When he finally enters the boardroom, there are more people than he expected. Darling is the owner of the law firm and is the first one to greet him when he enters. Everyone sits down while Darling lets everyone know that Pete is the new associate joining their ranks. Pete is surprised to find the guy who closed the elevator on him: he’s Red, an associate lawyer. The rest are Dee and Sam, both lawyers and finally Belle, a paralegal at the office. After the introductions, they discuss the cases they’re working on and the cases that have arisen so they can assign them. Pete is assigned a case related to spousal support and shared custody of a wealthy Chinese couple living in Thailand. At the end of the meeting, Darling announces that she will actively start evaluating their performance because they are finally opening a position for a partner in the Firm which is something that is new for a firm based in Thailand. The room goes silent and then, Darling asks Belle to show Pete his office. Belle perks up immediately and asks Pete to follow her. On their way to Pete´s office, Belle shows him around: toilets, break room, coffee machine, her desk… They finally reach his office, she tells him IT has enabled his user and his account info is inside the envelope on his desk. The smile she gives him when she leaves makes Pete well aware she finds him attractive. She crosses Red on her way out who enters Pete’s office and teases him about Belle. He introduces himself again and apologizes for the elevator incident. They talk, Pete finds him funny and decides to forget about the incident. They gossip about the people in the office. Red gushes over Dee and says Sam is a good lawyer. Pete asks about Captain and Red refers to him as the firm’s celebrity. He recognizes Captain is really good at his job but he’s quite uptight and doesn’t loosen up even outside the Firm. Red tells him about how everyone is vying for the partner position including himself and that they’ve been waiting for this opportunity for years. They discuss their cases, Pete complains he’s got an easy one which will not help to impress the bosses since he is interested in the partner position as well. Red is impressed by his eagerness and they decide to do their best, especially since Red would find it funny if the office’s celebrity doesn’t get the promotion.
Before leaving Pete’s office, Dee joins them and asks Pete if he likes bowling. Pete says he used to be quite good before college but he hasn’t played in years. Dee tells him they compete in an amateur bowling league on Thursdays and they are one player short which is a disqualifying reason. Dee and Red invite Pete to check the bowling alley that evening after work and Pete agrees. 
The bowling alley is called Neverland and is run by an American guy named George who started the amateur league to bring people to his business. Pete joins Red, Dee and Lily’s team The Starcatchers. To Pete’s surprise, Captain and Sam have a team with two other men called Bill and Sky who are their friends from highschool: their team name is The Pirates. It was Sam who invited Dee to gather her own team and participate. Captain is super competitive during their matches; just as Red said, he doesn’t loosen up and seems to be a sore loser. Pete makes it his goal to tease Captain in order to find what makes him tick. 
It’s always hectic at the law firm but Pete finds it’s a really nice place to work. The people are all competent and helpful. The story develops between their cases and the bowling competition. At one point, the Firm is hired by these siblings that want to sue the board of directors of the company they founded and Captain and Pete are appointed as their lawyers. It’s a tricky case and they start working after hours. During those meetings, Pete notices that Captain never wears a watch and gets a little tense every time someone asks what time it is. Pete on the other hand is proud of his Rolex that he bought with the money he earned during his first big case and takes every opportunity to flaunt it. No one knows what’s up with Captain and his watch phobia. One day, Captain and Pete are working late at Pete’s condo and Captain snaps at Pete for playing the flute claiming that it helps him think. Instead of getting angry, Pete asks him what’s going on and Captain just tells him he’s tense. Pete proposes to play some basketball to relax and lends him sports gear. They play one on one and it’s like magic because Captain finally loosens up and even smiles. Pete tries to pry about Captain’s life but he closes off. 
Although they are rivals in the bowling competition, they work smoothly and grow close. Pete starts to see Captain under a different light. They go to play basketball from time to time, only the two of them and during one of those games, they get a little rough and Captain breaks his arm and needs to wear a sling for two months. Pete feels awful and offers to help Captain in every way he can to which Captain reluctantly agrees. Since Captain cannot play bowling anymore (which irks him to no end), the Pirates need to bring another player to avoid being disqualified. They bring Star, Sky’s sister. She seems to be quite close to Captain and Pete realizes it bothers him, especially since he notices that Star’s phone lock is a picture of her and Captain that looks like they are a couple. Pete asks Captain if Star and him are dating and Captain denies it vehemently. Still Pete sees that Star keeps trying to be around Captain and believes she has an unrequited love as the one he himself seems to be harboring towards the same man. During a particular bowling match, where Pete is accompanying Captain to watch the Pirates play, Pete makes a joke about a clock ticking since Star is taking forever to throw the ball and Captain is upset and leaves the bowling alley. Pete runs after him and interrogates him because he doesn’t understand why Captain got so mad over a stupid joke. They scream at each other on the street and finally Captain opens up about losing his twin brother in a car accident. He was running late for a meeting and crashed his car. He explains that the one dating Star was Captain’s twin brother and that’s who she keeps a picture with on her phone. Captain keeps the broken watch that his brother was wearing the day of the accident in a box among his jewelry. That's why he doesn’t wear a watch and every time people talk about running late and the time it triggers him. He also joined the Pirate’s bowling team to substitute for his brother who used to be the star and that's why he always tries to win because he thinks he owes it to his late brother. Captain comes out to Pete almost immediately and says that even if Star hadn’t dated his brother he wouldn’t be interested. Pete is shocked but happy he really has a chance with Captain. He’s got a new goal to woo him but doesn’t disclose he’s bisexual himself. He starts doing works of service as it is his love language: brings him food, coffee, lends him a pen, etc… And Captain begins to soften which doesn't go unnoticed at the Firm. People gossip about Captain being more happy. 
During Belle’s birthday celebration, they decide to go for drinks afterwards and Belle kisses Pete. Captain sees it and leaves the premises. Pete runs after him. Captain is not upset he asks Pete to leave him alone but Pete knows he needs to disclose his feelings and he confesses. They kiss under a lamplight on the street. They are not officially dating but they are testing the waters and decide to keep it just for themselves and not tell anyone. Their happy arc develops.
The Pirates and the Starcatchers get to the semifinals and they face each other. Captain is finally playing again but his hand is not in the best conditions and the Pirates lose. He’s still happy his lover’s team won, because that puts on Pete the brightest smile. Red is teasing the losing team and jokes that Captain should start getting used to losing since Pete has good chances to snatch the partner position. It’s the first time Captain hears Pete wants that position too and thinks he approached him just to learn his weaknesses and get him out of that competition. When Pete is accused of such things, he is hurt because that means Captain doesn’t know him at all. They try to talk things through but they are too hurt and decide to talk again once the new partner is designated. The tension at the law firm is palpable after their fight. Pete confesses to Red that they had been hooking up but that learning that Captain could believe he was doing it all to cheat him out of the position hurt him too much. Red apologizes because if he had known they were an item he wouldn’t have teased them like that: he knows Captain was cheated out of a case in his former law firm by someone who faked dated him for love and had to resign. Pete goes to Captain’s office and closes the door behind him. He tells him how he felt when Captain told him those things but then tells him he has heard about his former job. He has no way to prove he had no other agenda when he approached him, of course he’s not giving up the new position, but he wants to show him he really cares by giving him his Rolex which he knows it’s gonna stay inside a box next to his brother’s. Pete puts the watch on Captain’s desk. Captain sees the watch and stands up without touching it and without a word, kisses Pete in the middle of the office while Belle, Dee, Red and Sam watch from the hallway (the offices have windows). They stop kissing when the phone rings. Pete answers all flustered and realizes it’s not his office but on the other side of the line it’s Lily saying they should stop kissing if they don’t want to be watched by half of the personnel. 
At the end, The Starcatchers lose the bowling championship, Dee gets the promotion (it must be shown how good she is all along the show) and Pete and Captain start thinking about starting their own law firm.

It was a Spencer Reid x OC on Wattpad and had (I think) 1.2 mil reads. Sadly, I don’t remember the title or the characters name. 

The story started by the OC running into Spencer and his coffee spilling all over her while on her morning run before a hospital shift. 
She offers to meet Spencer 20-30 mins after at a cafe to replace his order. Spencer ends up meeting them and he goes out of his way to see her again at this cafe a few days later. She agrees to a date only if he remembers her order from their first meeting at the cafe. 
The reader has to train a new nurse at their hospital? And her work bestie has the hots for the new guy as well. I remember a few commenters predicting the new trainee was going to be an unsub.

1h3bsup,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1h3bsup/thanksgiving_a_rant/,Thanksgiving. A rant.,"Working Thanksgiving is a hot pile of dogshit. Scheduled six people, 3 to open 3 to close. Consistently had only 3-2 baristas on the floor because breaks had to be ran. Me and my shift skipped our 30's because the cars were so rampant. People were constantly calling the damn phone asking ""are you guys open?? when do you close?? Are you guys open?? I just came through and my drink was WRONG!"" 

Customers bitching about not being able to order travelers in drivethru or having to wait for it. Heaven forbid a box of coffee takes any amount of time to make.

Entire families coming through DT and cafe, we had a cafe order that totaled around $85. 

Frankly, bless their hearts, but some baristas are also not cut out for the amount of traffic we received. Running the FOH with 1-2 people felt like a nightmare. Not to mention our shift was developing an allergic reaction during all of this. On a personal note, this job has been making me want to quit. Customers are consistently fucking stupid and exhausting to talk to. I feel a growing resentment day by day. I feel like im developing into the fast food equivalent of Patrick Bateman. The capacity for people's stupidity fascinates me on a near daily basis and thanksgiving just didnt help.

We got paid time and a half though! yahoo! Great thanks to our corporate overlords! :3

1h3brfg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h3brfg,Sharing hidden gems + cheap accomodation (with names),"Hii, I was in Bali this summer 2024.
I did a lot of research and specifically looked for less touristy places, surrounded by nature and still cheap!
Here I am, sharing the places that we visited and loved + names of the accomodations.
- All of the places we stayed were LESS THAN 20€ for 2 people per night.

I will share the places in chronological order:)

North Bali
■ Photo 1 : 2 days at Lovina beach - Not very hidden but not too many tourists either. We didn't like it that much but we loved the view from our room 
■ Photo 2,3,4 : 4 days at Git Git - Our favorite place! The most beautiful accomodation, surroundings I have ever seen! We went to see many waterfalls close by (Aling Aling and other lagoons around), and visited the most beautiful restaurants. We met barely any tourists, esp if you go in the morning (we went at 10am). Everything was 20 mins by foot from our jungle hut.
- there is a restaurant with rice fields view and it felt like heaven! It's called Pizzeria Setapak.
Also Shanti Restaurant was my favorite restaurant in the whole world! Beautiful music & views. We stayed from sunset until closing many times

West Bali :
■ Photo 5 : 1 day at Menjangan Island - I forgot to take photos of this one but it is incredible national park with deers & beautiful clear water!! No tourists. It's real paradise!
■ Photo 6 : 1 day visit to a Christian village - If you're looking for a place with incredible history with no tourists, this is a place to go! This village has very interesting story! There was literally noone! We walked across the streets, it felt so peaceful and beautiful

East Bali :
■ Photo 7 : 3 day stay in Tegalalang. We visited rice fields (if you go at 7/8am noone is there + the mist is magical). Our stay was perfect, the host delivered any food right to our room and cooked for us, really great prices and amazing host.

■ Photo 8 : 10 day stay at Nusa Lembongan. It has great places and restaurants but it's not super quiet. I shared some places that were not crowded :) Overall it was much less crowded than Bali tho! 10 days was too long to stay there :) Nice beaches but most of them are very rocky, big waves and not swimmable

Hope this list helps! If you have any questions, im super eager to answer:)",2,1732970448.0,BaliTravelTips,0,1.0,False

It still tastes better than my old dripper, no more burnt tast that I didn't know was there until I started using a FP.   
  
It's no a moldy taste, but it is like.. an old/dusty fouling that I've never noticed before. I've even tried adding barely a pinch of salt to see if that helps.. and it kind of knocks that terrible taste down just a hair.

1h3bqag,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1h3bqag/a_conversation_with_a_pimi_obedience_to_those/,"A Conversation with a PIMI: Obedience to ""Those taking the lead"" - Absolute or Relative? PARTS 1 &2. Your Review and Suggestions Would Be Appreciated.","**Context:** The Governing Body demands absolute trust and loyalty from JWs even if they provide direction that is illogical or unscriptural. This series of dialogues is designed to explore the answers to the following questions from the Bible's perspective: **Does God require that absolute trust and obedience be given to ""those taking the lead""? In Bible times, did Jehovah expect His people to accept without question everything said by those in positions of authority, such as prophets, kings, or priests? Would rejecting errors taught by these leaders constitute disloyalty to God?**

**PART 1**  
**\[Scene: Jake and Ken are seated on a park bench after the meeting, the cool evening breeze rustling the leaves.\]**

**Jake:** *\[leans back, gazing at the stars\]* So, Ken, what did you think of tonight’s meeting? That part about obeying the “Slave” even if their instructions don’t make sense—that really made me think.

**Ken:** *\[nodding, thoughtful\]* Yeah, it was powerful. It’s a reminder to deepen our trust in those Jehovah is using to guide us. This isn’t just about loyalty—it’s about survival.

**Jake:** True. *\[pauses\]* But here’s something I’ve been mulling over: Does Jehovah expect absolute, unquestioning obedience to them? Or is it more… relative?

**Ken:** *\[frowning slightly\]* Jake, Jehovah commands us to obey them. Obeying them is obeying Jehovah. Disobeying them is disobeying Him. For me, that makes it absolute. It’s about loyalty to Jehovah himself.

**Jake:** *\[sits forward, rubbing his chin\]* Hmm. That’s a strong stand. But let’s explore what absolute obedience really means. What if—just hypothetically—they directed us to stop going to hospitals when we’re sick? Would you comply?

**Ken:** *\[hesitant but resolute\]* Of course. Even if it doesn’t make sense from a human perspective, I trust their guidance comes from Jehovah.

**Jake:** *\[raises an eyebrow\]* Okay. But what if they told us to bow down to an image?

**Ken:** *\[blinks, surprised\]* Bow down? Well… it’s Jehovah’s arrangement. If they say so, I’d obey.

**Jake:** *\[leans closer, voice lower\]* And if they instructed parents to kill their firstborns?

**Ken:** *\[visibly uncomfortable\]* That would be… hard. But Jehovah would give me the strength to obey. Remember Abraham and Isaac? He trusted Jehovah completely.

**Jake:** *\[sits back, crossing his arms\]* So, in all these scenarios, the justification is that the Bible says to obey those taking the lead?

**Ken:** *\[firmly\]* Exactly.

**Jake:** *\[tilts his head\]* But Jehovah also commands obedience to governmental authorities, children to parents, and wives to husbands.

**Ken:** *\[narrowing his eyes\]* True… but what are you getting at?

**Jake:** *\[leaning in\]* Think about Romans 13:2: “Whoever opposes the authority has taken a stand against the arrangement of God.” Yet, if the government told us to bow to an idol or harm our children, would you obey?

**Ken:** *\[quickly\]* Of course not! Obedience to them is relative.

**Jake:** *\[raises a hand\]* Exactly. Even though Jehovah commands us to obey them, we recognize limits.

**Ken:** *\[pauses, frowning deeply\]* Hmmm. I hadn’t thought about it that way.

**Jake:** So, doesn’t that mean the command to obey those taking the lead also has limits? The fact that Jehovah commands it doesn’t automatically mean absolute, unquestioned obedience.

**Ken:** *\[slowly\]* That’s… a good point. Even the local elders are part of “those taking the lead,” but we don’t obey them absolutely. *\[looks up at Jake\]* So where *do* we draw the line with the Governing Body?

**Jake:** *\[smiling faintly\]* Good question. One worth thinking about carefully. *\[glances at his watch\]* Shall we continue this over coffee next time?

**Ken:** *\[still pondering, nodding absently\]* Yeah… let’s do that.

**\[The two stand and walk off, their conversation trailing into the night.\]**

**Part 2**

**\[Scene: Jake and Ken meet at a cozy café, the morning sun casting warm light through the windows as the aroma of coffee fills the air.\]**

**Ken:** *\[walking up to Jake with a purposeful stride\]* Hey, Jake! Got a minute? I’ve been thinking a lot about our conversation last week. It’s been on my mind, and I wanted to share some thoughts.

**Jake:** *\[smiling, motioning to the seat across from him\]* Of course, Ken. That was quite the discussion. Whether obedience to those taking the lead should be absolute or relative—it really made me think too. Grab a seat. Coffee?

**Ken:** *\[sitting down\]* Sure, thanks. *\[leans forward\]* Here’s what I’ve been thinking: While obedience to governmental authorities, parents, and husbands is clearly relative, doesn’t it feel different when it comes to God’s own organization? Wouldn’t it be in our best interest to cooperate fully with the arrangements Jehovah has instituted, even when we don’t understand or agree?

**Jake:** *\[nodding thoughtfully\]* You raise an important distinction. Unlike governments, the congregation is a part of God’s arrangement to guide us spiritually. If Jehovah has indeed directed us to place absolute trust in those taking the lead, then yes, it would be wise to comply.

**Ken:** *\[emphatically\]* Exactly. I mean, God has always used an organization to guide his people. That’s a pattern we see throughout history, right?.

**Jake:** *\[leaning back, steepling his fingers\]* That’s a key point, Ken. To make sure we’re following the best course, let’s break this down. We need to ask three critical questions:

1. What is an organization?
2. Has God always used one organization as his exclusive channel?
3. Has God ever required absolute, unquestioning obedience to those taking the lead?

**Ken:** *\[Thoughtfully\]* Those are solid questions. Let’s start with the first one. An organization, as the Reasoning book puts it, is “an association or society of persons whose efforts are coordinated for a particular work or purpose.” That seems straightforward enough.

**Jake:** *\[nodding\]* Good. Based on that definition, which organization would you say was God’s during the Dark Ages—from the 4th to the 19th century?

**Ken:** *\[pausing, frowning\]* Hmm. Because of the Great Apostasy, there wasn’t a single organization functioning as God’s channel during those centuries.

**Jake:** *\[leaning forward\]* And yet, as our publications remind us, there were always true Christians on Earth during that time, weren’t there?

**Ken:** *\[leaning back, thoughtful\]* That’s true. So… I guess that answers the second question—God hasn’t always used one organization as his channel. Interesting. I hadn’t thought about it like that.

**Jake:** *\[smiling\]* It’s a fascinating area for more research. But let’s tackle the last question. During the times God *did* use an organization, like when he formed Israel into a nation, who were those taking the lead?

**Ken:** *\[confidently\]* Moses and Aaron initially. Later, Jehovah established a priesthood to instruct the people, and at times, he raised up prophets, judges, and kings.

**Jake:** *\[smiling wider\]* Exactly! And let’s not forget, the kings were said to sit on “Jehovah’s throne,” representing his authority.

**Ken:** *\[nodding enthusiastically\]* Right. It was a theocratic arrangement, no doubt about it.

**Jake:** *\[raising a finger\]* So here’s the big question: Did Jehovah expect his people to give absolute obedience to these leaders at all times and under all circumstances?

**Ken:** *\[hesitant\]* Well… I suppose God would expect cooperation with his arrangements. Like when Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rebelled—they were opposing Jehovah himself.

**Jake:** *\[nodding\]* True. But let’s take a closer look. Imagine being an Israelite at Mount Sinai. Moses is up on the mountain, and Aaron, who is next in command, presents a golden calf, commanding everyone to bow to it. What’s the right thing to do? Obey Aaron or disobey him?

**Ken:** *\[pausing, frowning deeply\]* Disobey him, obviously. To please Jehovah, I’d have to. I see your point—obedience was relative, not absolute.

**Jake:** *\[leaning back with a smile\]* Exactly. And there are other examples where God’s servants were commended for disobedience to those taking the lead, even at the cost of their lives, like Jonathan refusing to cooperate with King Saul's persecution of David; Naboth refusing Ahab’s demand for his vineyard; or Uriah refusing David’s order to go home to his wife during wartime.

**Ken:** *\[nodding slowly\]* That’s true. And when the nation as a whole turned from Jehovah, individuals like Jeremiah or Daniel remained faithful by comparing their leaders’ actions with God’s Law.

**Jake:** *\[excitedly\]* Excellent! And ultimately, God even rejected Israel as his organization because of their rebellion. Faithful individuals had to rely on God’s Word to discern the right course. No wonder, in all my research, I have not come across any account of Jehovah asking for people to trust his organization or those who were taking the lead. The emphasis was always on trusting him, and not an organization.

**Ken:** *\[leaning back, deep in thought\]* This is all starting to come together. So, when it comes to those taking the lead today, maybe the same principle applies—relative obedience, based on how their instructions align with God’s Word. Hmm. You’ve given me a lot to think about. Maybe we should also examine how this applied to the first-century Christians. What were Jehovah’s expectations for them regarding those taking the lead?

**Jake:** *\[smiling warmly\]* Great idea. Let’s dig into that next. But for now, how about a refill on that coffee?

**Ken:** *\[chuckling\]*. This has been an eye-opener, Jake. Thanks for the coffee—and the insights.

**\[They head to the counter together, their discussion sparking curiosity and a renewed determination to study further.\]**",5,1732970329.0,exjw,0,1.0,False
1h3bq6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/uktravel/comments/1h3bq6q/trip_report_112529/,Trip Report 11/25-29,"Edited for formatting. Sorry if this is not the right flair or place for this. Took a trip this past week and wanted to put my thoughts into text. Please feel free to ask any questions. 

Nov 25: Arrival

-As an American, entry process was as easy as scanning passport and having your picture taken without talking to any human. Customs you just walked under the green sign and no one said anything about anything to you. Not even any random checks. 

-Contactless payment worked fine with Google pay and a capital one venture card with no prior bank notification required. 99.9% of places we went preferred contactless, even food vendors. Had no problems using contactless for the tube on my phone. 

-used Maya eSim that we got setup before arrival and it worked right on touchdown. Very easy to setup and use with great connection wherever we went since it would switch to whatever network was strongest, would highly recommend. 

-St. Giles Hotel London let us drop off our bags early at concierge before check in. Once we did check in at 2, we go to our (I'm assuming) refurbished room. For the purpose of our trip it was ""fine"" because the AC unit worked but the room was quite small and the ground was very dirty. We assumed it was because of only checking in that day but housekeeping never cleaned the floors at any time and at one point left a dirty rag on my suitcase. Noise level was moderate to high on the 6th floor, the window let in some fresh air but only partially opened. Hotel was VERY close to a large amount of food options and within eyesight of Tottenham Court Rd tube station so no complaints there.
 
-I appreciate that the sticker price is what your pay at the register. As an American, calculating tax before trying to buy something is frustrating. 

-Tunnel area across the bridge with a view of big ben had a long line at 9 AM on a random Monday (thanks influencers)

-Poppies fish and chips has the best tartar sauce we have ever had. Fish and chips were really solid too (had haddock)

-Busses were slower than walking around Soho in the afternoon so just walk

-Trafalgar square sausage stand on the right (facing the museum) had not-great bratwurst so maybe consider eating something else. Tasted more like American breakfast sausage than bratwurst. The middle drink stand had okay mulled wine and great mulled cider. Not a lot of seating in the middle market area so we just sat to the side on some steps and were fine.

Nov 26: WB Harry Potter Studio Tour Day

-Not new information, but book tickets way in advance. Took Tottenham Court to Euston via the tube. 

-Exited Euston underground and hooked around left to go to overground area. Big signs showing times. Staff there to help. Look for TIMES next to watford junction on listing's. There was a board that said ""next to watford junction"" but there was a train that arrived WAY before the time listed on that board from another platform. 

-bought advance overground tickets from west midlands railway website since they offer lower prices on advanced bookings and the ones we got were valid on any train that whole day with no time restrictions, which helped a lot. 

-First Harry Potter bus left at 9:18 and loaded about 9:13. We just showed our studio tickets and that was it. Arrived 9:30. Entered 9:48 even though out tickets were for 10am tour time. 

-No restrooms at exit of Watford Junction so be prepared. 

-had the ""Our Best Ever Sausage"" from Upper Crust which is just 3 cut up sausages on a plain baguette but it was still okay. Mild enough for our upset stomachs. The Honeycomb Hazlenut Latte was very good too. 

-There is a short video and music on busride to studio to set the mood

-Coat room is free at information desk but there is a line. 99% of tour is indoors so coats are not necessary. 

-Free passport guides were given to us at the entry hall by a wandering staff member. The stamps for the passport aren't the ink kind but indentations on the page. There are also golden snitches hidden around the tour with hints listed in the guide. They can be quite hard to find but staff are always willing the give some hints. There is a fairly massive selection of merchandise in all forms, some exclusive to the tour, such as the platform 9 3/4 shop with labeled merchandise sold exclusively at the shop halfway through the tour. Highly recommend visiting. 

-Left on 1:30 shuttle. Departed from same area as arrival but slightly different spot to que up. They didn't check our tickets on the way back. 

-Only rushed area is the banquet room after the short film. Everything else was self paced and you could be as quick as 45 minutes or many many hours if you read and watch everything. 

-Staff is super friendly and knowledgeable about the behind the scenes so be sure to hear them all out! 

-School group (school names were not on jackets) was there and if your institution was there 11/26 you should be embarrassed at how those kids acted. Staff had to play teacher for the largely absent adults by telling them to not run, yell, or wander off without the group. Teachers could not care less and just shrugged when students were sprinting around.
 
-Went to Kings Cross and Platform 9 3/4 after. A lot of the merchandise is the same minus some black and gold ""Harry Potter - London"" merch which looked quite cool. There is the exact same photo op for the platform in the tour so no need to go to both places.
 
-Had the popcorn chicken at Good Friend Chicken in Chinatown for dinner. Some of the best chicken we have ever had even without the seasoning flavors they offer. A huge highlight for our trip. 

Nov 27: Food

-Went to the Host Cafe. Beautiful and relaxing place to have coffee and a small breakfast. Would go again. 

-Popped by the Fortnum and Mason shop at The Royal Exchange thinking it would be more like an American mall but it was just two or three luxury shops and some restraunts upstairs. Pretty photo spot but not a necessity on any trip. 

-visited Leadenhall Market. It's neat for the photo opp but we did not eat or shop here. 

-visited The Ginger Pig, Humble Crumble, and The Cider House at Borough Market. Sausage roll from Ginger Pig was 90% sausage 10% crust. It was good but if you don't like onions skip this. Humble Crumble was good. May have been the weather but the berry filling was only warm when I went to eat it.  The cider house had a mulled cider that was good but pretty strong. 

-There is a seated step area right next to The Black Pig and Humble Crumble but can get crowded very quickly and there's a ton of birds/bird poop there too so beware. Maybe bring something to sit on here?

-in the evening went to Mercato Mayfair. Absolutely beautiful place with tons of great food options. We ate at the Beast & Field Steak booth and loved it. The Bavette was cooked great and seasoned very well. The chips we had with it were great as well. Would easily recommend this place as a must visit. 

Nov 28: British Museum and Hyde Park Winter Wonderland

-Go to back side of museum if you do not have a ticket. Cue early if you don't have one. We cued 20 minutes before open and there were 4 people in front of us. 10 minutes before open and there were easily 50 people behind us. At opening at 10am, there was a massive line. You walk through bag check and you are in no problem. If you dont have a bag they say just walk through. For history buffs, the British Museum is a must do with massive exhibits and a days worth of reading if you read all of the displays. There are interactive things to do for kids too so I highly recommend it. Had no idea how absolutely massive this place is. 

-At 11:30am the pub across the street, the Museum Pub, had very few people and the server was very nice. We had tea and a steak and ale pie. Both were great, the pie crust was very flaky and the steak was very tender. 

-Went later that afternoon to the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland. Hyde Park station ""felt"" the closest to the blue and green entrances. 

-I'm glad the entrance fee when we went was free because the prices of everything there were exorbitant and inconsistent. There would be a main alley booth for Cadbury hot chocolate for £5 and tucked away in a corner of a seating area right next to it would be the same hot chocolate for £3.20. Same for most hot drinks and even some foods. Saw some bratwurst for £11 then across the park it was £8. Rides were all state-fair/carnival level and easily skippable for anyone who has been to a real theme park. Would easily skip this next trip in favor of some great light displays along the streets and shopping centers. 

Nov 29:

Woke up at 4 AM to find Elizabeth line down, according to the Tfl Go App. Luckily purchased the Heathrow Express tickets the night before for £20 each since the Elizabeth line was down earlier in the week and we were paranoid. Took early bus to Sussex Gardens then walked (we missed the connecting) to Paddington Station. Got there at 5:06. The turnstiles to get in were all red so we walked to the open gate on the far left side? There was a worker there and didn't say to do otherwise. Walked on the train at 5:08 and the train departed at 5:10 even though it listed as 5:15. Arrived at 5:29. Weirdly our QR code tickets worked just fine for scanning out even though we never got to scan in. 

-Walk to get to security from the station took 17 minutes (walking at a reasonable pace) in case anyone is curious about the timing of those sorts of things. 

-Heathrow airport security was pretty quick and you DO have to remove your liquids from your bag, which is good to know since every airport is different these days. 

-Terminal 3 didn't list our gate until about an hour before boarding, I suppose to keep people in the central area with all the shops and food. You have to walk through a small mall to even get to that area. Small hack to get your gate earlier than the board is just look up your flight in a Google search and it lists the correct gate several minutes before it popped on the board.

We have been tweaking this plan, using Excel, and marking up these spaces within what will become a slightly and large kitchen. The wall at the bottom of the picture that joins the dining room room, which is hilariously large. As a result, we are moving the wall 2 feet to make the kitchen the size that you see now.

It should be obvious that there are four zones of this kitchen. My wife loves to bake, so we made a baking section near the ovens, we also really enjoy and eating in kitchen, so we have that corner nook area in the upper left. We are big coffee and tea drinkers, hence that section in the lower right. That leaves the more “traditional” part of the kitchen with a center Island and the usual range sink dishwasher.

Thoughts on where the fridge freezer are? Anything that jumps out to you as “oh no if you do it that way then XYZ will happen and will annoy you.” Or “it seems like you want ABC, have you thought about this? 

We’ve designed dream spaces in a few homes, but only actually pulled the trigger once. We are trying to make this a kitchen that we can live in for a long time, one that is appealing to the resale market. Should we ever want to sell, and would be very comfortable when extended family comes to visit. 

All thoughts and questions are welcome. Yes we are working with an architect. Just trying to refine all of our ideas before we bother the architect for final edits.   

Haven’t even gotten to cabinets yet but excited to make those friendlier to my wife’s health condition, she is particular short (not the health condition lol) and has Ehlers Danlos. If anyone has experience with that or designing for that, thank you in advance for whatever thoughts you have!  

Already considering cabinets that, upon opening, have heavy appliances like stand mixers on a lift that come to counter height. But we are new to all this. Many thanks in advance and happy holidays. 

Tl:dr; designing ideal kitchen, trying t eliminate risk of regrets (‘forgot that’ or ‘what a waste’

Make difficult things *look* easy, and suddenly the barrier to entry drops.

And in this case, it’s the barrier to shipping products *fast*.

Before this, I always thought coding something complex meant hours of pain, coffee, and Googling error messages. 😅 But Marc’s way of breaking things down makes you think, “Wait, is it really this simple?”

Spoiler: It’s not *simple*, but the way he teaches removes that overwhelming “where do I even start?” feeling.

Now I’m excited to ship faster, learn smarter, and (hopefully) avoid breaking things too much in the process.

If you’ve been on the fence about learning to code or leveling up, this course is worth it. Highly recommend.

Patches Guerrero had long accepted her place in the world. She wasn’t the prettiest, the most charming, or the kind of woman people noticed twice. At 40, living in a quiet single-attached home in a town just outside the metro with her three cats—Chandler, Joey, and Abby—she found peace in routines. Morning coffee with a splash of condensed milk, evening comic book reading,, and occasional binge-watching marathons of obscure shows she’d already seen three times over.

Her mother, a lively senior citizen who spent her days coordinating church events and neighborhood Zumba classes, lived with her. On either side of their home were her elder sister and younger brother—both single and absorbed in their own quiet lives. Their close-knit little trio of houses formed a cocoon, one that made Patches feel safe, even as she longed for something... more.

Patches was an introvert at heart, forced to wear an extroverted mask for work. She had spent 18 grueling years in the advertising industry, navigating deadlines, difficult clients, and the constant pressure to prove herself. Now, three months into her new role as Business Unit Director at a mid-sized agency, she was still struggling to find her footing.

Her boss, Ricky Asuncion, was perfectionist personified. Anal and uptight. He had an uncanny ability to make Patches feel like she was “lacking,” even after years of accolades and experience. Ricky’s sharp words often echoed in her mind late at night, amplifying the hum of her Persistent Depressive Disorder and anxiety. Still, she soldiered on, leaning on her two dependable Senior Account Managers—Tin and Mika, both Gen Z dynamites who somehow made the chaos of advertising bearable.

One Thursday morning, Patches sat in her cramped home office, hunched over her laptop as Chandler pawed insistently at her mug. She was pulling together a last-minute deck for a high-stakes client presentation when the room seemed to shimmer.

The report she had been agonizing over? Done. And not just done—perfect. The data aligned flawlessly, the visuals popped, and the messaging was sharper than anything she could have come up with on her own.

Patches blinked at the screen. Had she blacked out? She scanned the document, her heart pounding. It was undeniably her work, yet she had no memory of completing it.

The clock ticked on. There was no time to question the strange turn of events; the presentation loomed.



Chapter 2: Threads Unraveling

At first, Patches chalked it up to stress. Maybe her mind had worked overtime while she zoned out. But when it happened again—this time with an impossible timeline for a campaign that miraculously fell into place—Patches couldn’t ignore it anymore.

She tested it, tentatively at first. A wish here, a fleeting thought there. Each time, the universe seemed to nudge reality in her favor. A parking spot at the crowded grocery. A sudden stroke of genius during a brainstorming session. A canceled meeting just when she was on the verge of tears.

“Am I losing it?” she whispered to Chandler one night as he curled up on her lap. Joey and Abby lounged nearby, unimpressed by her existential crisis.


Chapter 3: Javier

Amid the swirling chaos of her newfound “power,” Javier, a long-time online friend, re-entered her life. They had met in person only once, years ago, but their friendship had been sustained through shared interests in video games, geeky pop culture, and late-night chats.

Javier was an introvert too, though his charm and good looks had earned him a reputation as a bit of a player. Patches knew about the string of women he kept at arm’s length—never committing, always distant. Still, there was something about him that made her feel seen in a way few others did.

Their conversations grew deeper, stretching into hours. But while Patches began to hope for something more, Javier seemed oblivious to her feelings.

Chapter 4: Discoveries and Doubts

The more Patches leaned into her strange ability, the more the lines between what she wanted and what she needed blurred. Her powers weren’t infallible—they worked best when her intentions were pure. She couldn’t just will a million dollars into her bank account or turn herself into someone she wasn’t.

But she could make small shifts in the world around her. Enough to nudge her life forward.

Chapter 5: The Fallout

One day, Patches pushed too far. In a desperate moment of self-doubt, she wished for Ricky to see her worth. The next day, he announced her promotion—but it was a hollow victory. The team resented her newfound success, and even Tin and Mika seemed wary of her.

Her powers had given her what she thought she wanted, but at what cost?


Chapter 6: The Turning Point

Javier visited Patches at her home for the first time, surprising her with a rare gesture of closeness. They spent the day playing video games, walking around the neighborhood, and reminiscing about old cartoons. By evening, they spent more time talking at the overlooking deck.  As the city lights twinkled below them, Patches felt a rare moment of contentment.

“Do you ever feel like you’re living someone else’s life?” she asked.

“All the time,” Javier replied. “But I think we get to decide how much of it we make our own.”


Chapter 7: More Than Enough

Patches let go of trying to control her world. She began using her powers not for perfection but for possibility. At work, she guided her team with trust instead of fear. At home, she embraced her quirks and found joy in the smallest moments.

And Javier? One quiet evening, as they talked about their favorite Pokémon, he confessed, “I think I’ve been looking for something real, and maybe... it’s been you all along.”

Patches laughed, surprised by how natural it felt. She didn’t need magic to make someone care for her. She was enough, just as she was.

I am tired of relating love songs to fictional characters, and I am hoping we could change that?

  


About me: A 24-year-old gurlie living independently (big word) somewhere in the City of Manila. With the prompt I decided to go with in this post, you might think I'm a big music lover. But tbh, I'm just a casual music listener. Instead of having a vast music library in my phone, I listen to the same song over and over until I get sick of it. 



Most of my time is spent accomplishing academic tasks (I am doing postgrad). But when I am not hitting the books or doing clinical exams, you may find me exploring coffee shops, bookstores, and toy stores! I have a knack for collecting cute and random stuff. I consider myself an introvert and someone who enjoys staying indoors more. I value private time and solitude.

  


Appearance-wise, I am 5'4"" in height and is plus-size. Definitely not within the normal BMI. I have started to embrace a healthier lifestyle a few months back and although the progress is definitely slow, I try to be more forgiving because I am ultimately doing this for self-love.  I don't think I have ever been considered conventionally attractive, but I don't think I am ugly din naman. I smell good and is very particular with hygiene. 

  


About you: Same age or older than me. Not a hard rule though, just my preference. I'm also open to dating someone younger, but please not by more than 2 years hehe. I'd love it if you are the type to have a go-to song for every mood or every occasion! I also would prefer if you live nearby, so we can go explore museums and coffee shops together, or even go for walks. Some of my other interests that could be similar to yours would be: anime, manhwa/manga, and gaming. But I would also appreciate if you could share your hobbies with me, I am open to trying and discovering new things. Please be a decent person, be honest about what you want, and do not interact if you think our intentions do not align. 

  


Warning: Might over-analyze song lyrics with you on our first date!

What happens when it's a CVT?   I normally drive it in M for fun and engagement.  I put it in D when I'm drinking a coffee or engage the cruise control assist.   

Sometimes the engine doesn't seem its in the right ""RPM"" range and the engine feels like it's strained.  One time I gave it some beans in D and the ""RPM"" shot up so fast to like 5,000RPM.   I've grown familiar with the RPMG and response range in this car and I've noticed 3,000RPM is about where it will respond in kind.   That's where I feel comfortable giving it some beans and rewarded with the push you back in the seat confirmation.
