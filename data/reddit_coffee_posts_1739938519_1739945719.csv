Cosmetic Dental Treatment Options Available at Restoration Dental Group. We have great success with this whether it is whitening, veneers, complete smile makeover, with giving the best care to our clients.

**Cosmetic Dentistry: Makeover Your Smile**

As for cosmetic dentistry, it refers to a variety of procedures performed to improve the look of your smile. The most popular is teeth whitening, which aims to remove stains and discolouration caused by age, coffee or smoke. Over-the-counter (OTC) whitening treatments are less effective and less safe than professional whitening treatments, providing you with a brighter, more youthful smile in just one treatment.

Ideal for patients interested in covering chips, cracks, and alignment issues, porcelain veneers correction. Custom-made to focus on your beautiful little pearly whites, these thin shells of durable porcelain are placed over your natural teeth, covering imperfections to help you achieve a “near perfect” natural smile. Porcelain veneers can be a permanent way to completely change the look of your teeth.

If you have gaps in your smile or missing teeth altogether, dental implants are ideal for you. Why Do You Need Dental Implants — The Long term Implant Solution To Missing Teeth? Over the years, the use of porcelain in these teeth made people realize that porcelain has amazing features because it is resistant against external factors and can withstand the chewing pressure.

**Why Restoration Dental Group?**

As no two patients are the same, at Restoration Dental Group we spend time getting to know you and your needs so that we can customise treatments to help you reach your goals. Also, so you can add to your uncertainty about the efficacy and comfort of your treatment, our [cosmetic dentists Wheaton](https://www.restorationdentalgroup.com/services) are all utilizing the latest technology and techniques.

MORNING:
-Breakfast (half in puzzle toy and other half in frozen Topl toy)
-Frozen lick mat 
-10 min of training
-walk around the block or fetch in the yard (it’s winter in Wisconsin.. he doesn’t last long outside).
-bully stick 

AFTERNOON:
-10 min training
-15 min play 
-fetch outside (15 max) 
-Crate for 6 hrs while I go to work. He is crated with blankets, frozen kong, chew toys, and tuffy toy.

EVENING:
-10 min play 
-10 min training 
-Dinner in frozen topl toy and puzzle feeder
-lick mat 
-outside for fetch 
-bully stick 

He’s in training to be my service dog. During the week we take trips to stores, coffee shops, libraries.. anywhere really. A couple times a month he goes to group training, has play dates, hiking, and off leash running at different spots. 
He’s able to start agility soon so I signed him up for that and we’re going to try swimming again. His first experience didn’t go well because the guy forced him into the water.

I already had beans at home from my previous setup so I got about 250gm beans grinded by a local roaster. I told them to grind for espresso but when I pull the shots at home, the machine fails to achieve even 9 bar and the shots running 20ish seconds including profusion. So I'm stuck with this coffee which I believe isn't fine enough and the grinder is still 7-8 days away. 

Is there anything I could do to pull better shots in the meantime, without wasting this batch of good quality coffee? I was thinking either:
1. Use filter papers before and after the puck prep to add some resistance? Would it work? 
2. Use the pressurized basket, but would it be too fine for pressurized basket? Can it choke the machine instead? 
3. Get more beans grinded finer and blend them? 
4. Remove the pre infusion? Does it helped coffee remain dry and create more resistance?",1,1739944516.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Within a year, he had a double stroke in front of me on Easter morning. A completely healthy young man or so I thought.

It was then we learned he had become a diabetic having to completely alter his life, including stopping vaping. Within three months of the strokes, he began vaping again and within a year stopped taking his medication and checking his blood sugar entirely.  

This past October he had a heart attack and ended up having double bypass surgery at 40 years old, 95% blockages of his LAD and RCA, and still has a 55% blockage in another artery. I was at the hospital daily to hear every doctor, nurse and countless PT and support staff , including dietary, lay out every single thing imaginable a person could know to continue his life and survive this tragedy. 

It has been four short months and he’s going for all his doctor-ordered testing and visits. He’s vaping again, eating out almost every meal with no restraint, eating sugar, drinking copious amounts of coffee, not checking blood sugar levels or blood pressure…the only thing he’s doing is taking his medicine. 

I’ve tried to talk to him about it but he explodes with anger and leaves. I’ve asked him to seek mental health help, but to no avail. I don’t want to harp on him as it only deepens the divide we have. 

I fear his time here is not much longer. I’m grieving terribly behind closed doors. He’s such a beautiful soul with so many friends and family who love and support him. He’s a college graduate and has a career he loves. I believe the issue is he just doesn’t care about himself in the slightest. I’m believe I’ll lose him soon and feel hopeless am terrified I won’t be able to save my son a third time. ",0,1739944507.0,GriefSupport,0,0.33,False

The garage door rumbled closed as Melody set the kickstand on her bike. Retrieving the grocery bag from the basket, she stepped through the door to the kitchen, only to be assailed by the odor of…

“Is something burning?” She asked as she hurried into the kitchen.

“Maaaaybe.” Her father looked up from the stove with a chagrined smile. “I’m a bit more out of practice than I thought.”

“Daddy?” She set the bag on the counter and stepped up beside him. “What are you doing? I was going to make chicken and rice tonight.”

“Yeah, I should have called first. Sorry.” 

“It’s okay, daddy, but… is something wrong? Are you hungry?”

Gary laughed and it warmed her heart. It was the kind of laugh that she remembered from when her mother was still alive. “No, no, nothing like that. I just got to thinking about the future. You’re not going to be around to look after us forever, and Chloe’s not exactly chomping at the bit to help around the house. I need to get some practice feeding the two of us while I still have you around to help.”

Melody fell into a contemplative silence as she watched her father stir the pot. Worry vied with relief in the back of her mind, but she set that tangled knot aside and moved to the pantry. Returning with a handful of spices, she set them on the counter beside the stove. “These should go well with it, going by how it smells. I’ll get the table set and grab Chloe.”

She gathered the place settings and took them to the table, then headed down the hallway. Pausing momentarily at the door to her sister’s room, she sighed and knocked. “Chloe?”

A moment’s wait yielded no reply, and she cautiously pushed the door open.

Her sister glared from where she sat curled in her armchair. “What do you want?”

“Well, dinner’s almost ready,” Melody said slowly. “But… what’s wrong?”

Chloe sniffed and turned back to the phone in her lap. “I’m not hungry.”

“Are you sure?” Hesitantly, Melody stepped into the room. “You didn’t eat last night.”

“I said I’m fine!”

“But-”

“Just leave me alone!”

“Chloe…”

“Why are you doing this?” She demanded, rising from her chair and stalking forward.

“Doing what?”

“Why are you taking *his* side?!”

“I’m not taking either side!”

“You want me to go out there and pretend nothing’s wrong!” Chloe’s face was red behind her accusatory finger. “Just sit and eat dinner like a big ol’ *happy family.* That’s taking his side.”

“I want you to stop! You’re hurting yourself just as much as him!”

“He deserves to be hurt!”

Melody took an involuntary step back as the words struck her almost like a physical blow. Her sister turned, still scowling, marched back to the chair and flopped down, kicking her feet up over the arm.

“But… You…” She wasn’t sure what to say, exactly. New worry joined the knot of concern for her father that squirmed in her stomach. “You can’t keep doing this to him!”

“I can. Watch.”

“But *why?!* Are you just going to spend the rest of your life hating him?”

Chloe just shrugged.

“What about school? What about *college?!*”

“What about it?”

“You’re gonna need help to pay for it, aren’t you?”

“Maybe.”

“Is he still supposed to help you after… *this?”*

“He *could* screw me over, but that would just prove me right.”

“But *You’re* proving *him* right, right now!”

Chloe leapt to her feet, eyes blazing, but her voice was cold as ice. “Get out of my room.”

Levi shivered as Rhe’alla’s dragged her fingers lightly down his sternum, under his shirt. 

“Somebody’s enjoying themself.” She purred in his ear. 

He considered a moment before nodding, ignoring the grass that tickled at the back of his neck. “Mostly, yes.”

“Mostly?” Rhe’alla’s fingers paused mid-stroke, and she raised herself up onto her elbow from where she lay beside him on the grass. “Is something wrong?”

“No-no, not wrong… Just weird.”

“What?”

Levi chuckled as he rolled onto his side, facing her. “It’s fine, nothing’s wrong.” He patted her hand, still under his shirt. “It just doesn’t feel real. I keep thinking I’m going to wake up.”

“I think I understand.” Rhe’alla relaxed and her hand resumed its slow migration down his torso. “I feel like I’m in a dream, right now.”

“I’m glad I could be entertaining.”

“You’re *far* more than just entertaining!” She admonished as she leaned forward, brushing her nose against his. “You’re delicious, too.”

Levi’s smile was buried under the onslaught of soft purple lips. It still took a conscious effort to relax as Rhe’alla’s hand slid around to his back, pulling his body into hers. The scars didn’t *actually* hurt, but he’d spent long enough being careful that it had become something of a habit. The warmth of her body was an inviting contrast to the cool of the grass, and Levi felt himself… *respond.*

“What’s wrong?” Rhe’alla asked with a worried frown as he broke the kiss.

“I’m… um… My pants are getting a bit crowded.” He felt his cheeks warming as he squirmed, trying to discreetly make room for the now-angry one-eyed trouser-snake. 

“Oh…” Rhe’alla’s eyes widened as her face went blue. “So… Do you want help with that?”

“We’re in public!”

Her smile took on a decidedly predatory cast. “That’s fine.”

“It’s *not* ‘fine,’ it’s something you can get arrested for!”

“I’ll make sure it’s worth it.” There was a singsong note in her voice and she wiggled her eyebrows suggestively, giving his belt buckle an experimental tug.

Levi shook his head with a chuckle. “You’re terrible.” Any chance at subtlety being *completely* annihilated, he swatted her hand away and grabbed the front of his jeans, making the critical adjustments.

“And you’re sexy,” She said, wrapping her arms around him again and pulling him in for another kiss.

“Hey guys, sorry I’m so late. I- Oh!”

Melody wore an expression of mild embarrassment as Rhe’alla and Levi broke apart and turned to look at her.

“Hey Melody!” The two on the grass chorused. Rhe’alla even managed to make it sound innocent.

“Should I… come back later?”

Rhe’alla rolled her eyes. “No! Get over here, silly!”

Glancing around, Melody stepped off the paved walkway that wound through the park and joined them where they lay in the shade of a tree.

“What’d ya bring?” Levi nodded at the bag that she set at her feet and began digging in.

“A blanket,” She said, unfurling the thick cloth and laying it down beside them. “And some snacks.”

Levi scrambled up to help spread the blanket, but Rhe’alla just gave a languorous stretch. “The grass is so nice, though. Why do we need the blanket?”

“I don’t want to get my dress dirty.”

“That just means you need to be on top.”

Levi snickered as he sat down, with Melody politely ignoring them both as she retrieved containers of sliced fruit and crackers from the bag. Rhe'alla just rolled over, taking up one side of the blanket. 

“Would madame like an apple slice?’ Levi asked, wagging the fruit above Rhe’alla's prone form with a grin.

“Oh yes!” Her tongue snaked out and plucked the proffered morsel from his fingers. “I love it when you give me something yummy to suck on!” 

Levi smiled despite the blush he felt crawling up his face. “Kinda walked into that one, didn't I?”

Their levity faded as they both realized Melody wasn’t laughing. She sat quietly beside them, fidgeting with the basket, looking… distant.

“Is something wrong?” Rhe’alla glanced between the two, brow furrowed in concern.

“No,” Melody said, still gazing into the distance with a slight frown.

“Is it something we said?”

“Hmm?” 

Levi carefully took her hand. “Is it something we *haven’t* done?”

Melody blinked at the worried faces of her two companions. “Wait, what? What have you not done?”

“I don’t know, but I *do* know that look.” Levi exchanged looks with Rhe’alla before continuing. “You’ve got something weighing on your mind. What’s going on?”

“I’m sorry.” Melody said glumly. “It’s just… Chloe’s being *horrible* to Daddy. I tried talking to her before dinner last night, and it’s no accident. She *means* what she’s doing, trying to hurt him on purpose. He’s doing his best not to show it, but it’s really bothering him. I just don’t know what to do with her anymore, but the thought of the two of them alone in that house…”

“I could beat her up for you?” Rhe’alla offered.

“What?! No!”

“It was just an idea.” She raised her hands defensively. “I mean, if Solanna was being horrible to *my* father, I’d probably have to wait my turn to beat her up.”

Levi blinked. “I… can’t tell if you’re joking…”

“Nope.” Rhe’alla shook her head. “Our moms would probably just ground her, but if Trik’sis caught her making papa cry…? Yeah, she’d be a blue smear across the back yard.”

“Either way,” Melody said emphatically, “No, I do *not* want you to assault my sister.”

“No beatings.” Rhe’alla nodded, then sighed at Melody’s look. “Fine, *or* anything else! Sometimes you’re no fun. I mean, shoving her in a garbage bin wouldn’t hurt *much.*”

“So what *can* we do?” Levi asked hastily.

Melody grew quiet as she frowned down at the blanket. “I need to be able to talk to her in a way that she’ll listen, instead of just brushing me off.” 

“So we-”

Melody raised a peremptory hand. “Just let me think out loud for a minute, please?” Her companions nodded, and she worried at her lip for a moment before continuing. “She doesn’t really talk to many adults from church or school that I know of. I don’t think she’d talk to Zachariah, either, but maybe if you two were there, she wouldn’t be quite as quick to snap back?”

“You really think she’ll feel bad about mouthing off to *us?*” Levi asked in surprise. “Sorry, but that would kind of be a first.”

“I know… but *I’ll* feel better if I have you there.”

“Done.” Rhe’alla sat up with an emphatic nod. “We’ll be there. I’ll just need a bit of notice so my family doesn’t wonder where I’ve gone while we bury the body… Joking, of course. Mostly.”

“Thank you.” Melody’s shoulders slumped. “I’m sorry to have to ask. I just don’t know what else to do.” 

“Why would *you* be sorry?” Rhe’alla tilted her head to one side. “It’s what we’re here for! Being a family means embracing the work *and* the fun!”

Melody gave a half-hearted smile. “I know, but I still…”

Levi gave her a sympathetic smile and tugged at her hand. “You’ve been there for me when I needed it. I’m happy to be able to do the same for you.”

Melody allowed herself to be pulled closer, and Levi gathered her up in his arms, hugging her to his chest. Rhe’alla scooted in close and wrapped her arms around them both as Levi laid the two of them down into the Shil’vati girl’s embrace. 

They lay quietly for some time, the reverent whisper of the leaves suffusing the air like a murmured prayer. Melody lay with her head on his arm, and her voice was brittle when she did eventually speak.

“I’m glad Daddy stopped drinking, but… but he’s so fragile right now. I don’t know what to do! Chloe’s become a complete *stranger* to me! She’s hurting him in our own home! Please… I-I can’t leave them like this.” 

Hot tears had begun to soak through his sleeve before he realized she was crying.

“...aaand Warp World!”

Dale cackled maniacally as the other three men groaned and began picking cards up off the table.

“My kingdom for a blue source,” Gary grumbled as he shuffled his deck. 

“On the bright side, you’ll probably get one,” Spud offered with a conciliatory smile.

“I liked my kingdom better.”

“Sorry I’m late!” Brelak’s voice came from the top of the stairs, followed soon after by the man himself. He was carrying what looked like an insulated shopping bag.

“No worries!” Zachariah called, waving him over. “All ya missed out on so far is our resident mad-man fishin’ for his Monkey Cage.”

Brelak was *almost* skipping as he made his way over to the table and threw an arm around Spud’s shoulders in a side-hug that took the Human by surprise. “I’ve heard that *someone* caught the attention of an eligible suitor! An officer, too! Congratulations!” 

Spud’s face was a study in confusion. “I… what?”

Brelak released him and moved over to the counter by the fridge. “Why, the Sergeant, of course!” With a flourish, Brelak produced a bottle of champagne from the bag and set it on the counter. “Thry’sis mentioned that she’d been-”

“Brelak,” Zachariah interrupted with a worried glance at Gary. “Some of us can’t drink that.”

“I know that, silly!” Grinning proudly, he sat a bottle of Martinellie’s sparkling cider next to the champagne. “I consulted a professional!”

“...oh.”

With a satisfied nod, Brelak began plucking long-stem champagne flutes from the bag and lining them up neatly by the bottles. “The young man was *quite* helpful. He explained that this particular non-alcoholic beverage was something of a local tradition.”

“Brelak,” Gary said hesitantly, pointing to the cabinet. “You could have just used the glasses we have here.”

“Those are *cups,* Gary. *Plastic* cups.” Brelak regarded him coolly and managed not to roll his eyes before grinning over at Spud. “*These* are for celebrating, and that’s what we’re doing!”

“...oh.”

The Shil’vati man carefully removed the cage from the cork and began working it free. The four Humans held their collective breath, but there was no more than a soft hiss as the cork came away, and Brelak gave a satisfied nod. Turning to the cider, he began fishing in his pockets.

“Here,” Spud said, holding out a bottle opener attached to his key-chain.

“Ah.” Brelak nodded graciously, popping the lid and returning the tool. “Thank you, Mr. Hunter. Now, what is your preference; bubbly, or fruity?”

Spud did his best to suppress a smirk. “I’ll take bubbly.”

One flute was filled and passed across the table. “And you, Mr. Dixon?”

“Same for me, please.”

The second flute made its way around the table. Brelak poured two glasses of sparkling cider, handing one each to Gary and Zachariah, filling the final glass with champagne before settling in at the table between Zachariah and Spud. “To your most excellent health, Spud Hunter!” He offered.

“What?” Brelak frowned in confusion as the rest of the table dissolved into laughter. “Did I say something wrong?”

“No, no.” Spud grinned. “It’s just… Well, if we’re gonna be all formal about this, you may as well use my real name.”

“Your name is not Spud?”

“It’s Octavian.”

Brelak blinked. “I have never heard *anyone* call you by that name.”

“Well, yeah. I prefer Spud.”

“But *why?*”

“Octavian is a *terrible* name!”

“But Oct’avian is a *wonderful* name!”

Spud grimaced. “‘Octavian’ is someone who’s distinguished and well spoken, who went to Julliard and plays the violin at Carnegie Hall.” He shook his head with a sigh. “That’s not me.”

“...oh.” Brelak frowned down at his glass. “Well, if you prefer your chosen name, then I see no reason to call you what you do not like. I was just worried I had given offense.”

“‘Spud’ is also another name for a potato.” Dale offered. “The mental image of ‘one who stalks root vegetables’ is quite funny. Especially when you don’t know you’re making the joke.”

Brelak’s eyes widened, and he turned to look back at Spud. “You prefer the name of a vegetable above your given name?”

Spud gave a slight shrug. “It is what it is.”

Zachariah had time to grow concerned at Brelak’s expression of mounting horror, but the smaller man rallied. “Well… yes. Well then! Here is to your most excellent health, Spud, and to happiness in your future.”

The rest of the table echoed the toast, and they all drank.

“Now,” Brelak said, leaning forward with an eager smile. “Tell me *everything!”*

“Everything? About what?”

“About everything! Is she treating you well? Is she being pushy? Does she consider *your* needs? You know how women can be.” He paused, frowning thoughtfully. “Well actually, you probably don’t. Good thing I’m here to look out for you!” 

Glances of mild discomfort passed around the table before Spud spoke. “I thought a gentleman wasn’t supposed to kiss and tell?”

“Not supposed to-! No! Where did you hear something like *that?”*

“Oh, you know,” Dale mumbled. *“Around.”*

“Goodness no,” Brelak plowed forward, ignoring Dale. “That’s the kind of attitude that keeps men in dangerous situations! Just imagine, some poor young man gets into a relationship out on the periphery; his family could be hours or even days away, communication can be spotty, and he might only see other people once or twice a month. No, you’ve got to be ready to take advantage of your opportunities when you can.”

Spud’s forehead wrinkled with concern. “You almost make it sound like a jailbreak.” 

“Sometimes it is.”

“...Why?” Gary asked, hesitantly.

“‘A woman can always walk away, but a man must escape.’ I thought everyone knew that!” Brelak looked around the table with an expression of apprehension and sighed. “Think about it; they are *dangerous*. That is not to say they’re bad, but they can hurt us without even trying. Thry’sis once pulled me out of the way when a young diplomatic attache lost control of  a ground-car. Poor girl was driving on ice for the first time. My neck was messed up for days and I had bruises on my arm where she grabbed me.” He shook his head emphatically. “No, any young man who’s ended up in a bad situation, no matter how he got there, may only get one chance to escape.”

“But, what about the Interior?” Gary protested. “Surely they would step in if someone were in danger.”

“Of course they would… *if* they knew.”

“Hence,” Zachariah said with a nod of understanding. “The need to talk about it.”

“So,” Brelak’s teeth gleamed as he smiled at Spud. “Let’s talk.”

“Well… um… she’s nice. She’s been… considerate. She seems worried about being too pushy, so that’s a good sign, right?” Spud waited for Brelak’s nod before continuing. “She definitely thought she might accidentally hurt me, but I cleared that up with the quickness.”

Brelak arched an eyebrow. “You did?”

“I picked her up in a fireman’s carry. She was a bit shocked.”

“As impressive as that may be, what exactly did that clear up?”

“...I’m not the delicate flour that she thought I was?”

“Ah, well, *I* did not mean to imply that you were, either. But if things were to take a… *rough* turn, I should like to help you spot - and heed - the warning signs before she does you harm.”

“How are we defining harm?”

Brelak looked up sharply. “Broadly.”

“Well, we’ve already hurt each other a couple times while sparring, but that hardly seems-”

“Each *other?!”*

“Well, yeah, but-”

“And what in the deeps is ‘sparring’?! She should know better than to be putting you in danger!”

“Whoa there, hold on, slow down.” Spud held up his hands with a grin. “It’s practice fighting, and it took me weeks to convince her to try. Don’t go scaring her off again!”

Brelak’s expression was one of horror. “You are *fighting* with her for *fun?!”*

“It’s more like wrestling.”

Brelak merely looked puzzled. 

“Trying to hold the other person in a way they can’t escape from.” 

“That sounds terrifying!”

Spud’s cheeks flushed slightly and his lips quirked into a smug smile. “Oh, it’s *definitely* fun.”

“...oh.”

“God damn-it…” Eli grumbled, tucking his phone away.

“Everything good?” Logan glanced over from the breaker box with a concerned expression.

“Yeah,” Eli waved a hand dismissively. “Just a girl flaking out on getting together tomorrow. She said her mom needs her to work on something.”

“A player already, eh?” Logan chuckled, then gave an appreciative nod. “Don’t sweat it too much. They can’t help it.”

“What do you mean?”

Logan shrugged. “She’s probably just giving you shit to see how you react. Play it cool. She’ll come around.”

“I… don’t think so.” Eli said hesitantly. “She’s not really like other girls.”

Logan gave a single snort of laughter. “Of course not.”

“She’s never done that kind of thing before…” Eli said hesitantly.

“Trust me, they always do. But like I said, they can’t help it.”

“They can’t?”

“Nope.” Logan laughed. “I once had a girl yell at me for an hour on the phone. When she wound down, I didn’t say nothin’. Just let the silence hang. Within five minutes, she had worked herself into a panic and was begging me not to leave her. I didn’t have to say a word.”

“For real?!” Eli’s expression turned thoughtful. “Huh. I wish I’d known that sooner…”

“Don’t waste time trying to undo the past. You know now. That means you’re ahead of the game. Most guys don’t learn until it’s way too late, if at all.”

“The more you knooooow!” Eli sang out with a laugh. “Got any other fortune cookies in your pocket?”

“Uh…” Logan paused with a blink. “Never trust the Purps?”

“Cliche, much?”

“No way. I’ve never seen anything good come of it. Not once. They’ll come in and take something over, promising to make things better. Sure, it seems like it’s going well, but then things start to happen. Little things, at the start. Unexpected expenses. Legal trouble. Maybe a car won’t start, and some Purp just *happens* to be there to offer a ride. Once the hook is set, things get bad. People go missing. Sometimes they get arrested. Sometimes not. The Interior shows up. People trying to live their lives get conscripted. It’s all bullshit.” Logan shook his head. “They're all the same, and you just can’t trust ‘em…” He turned his head to catch Eli’s eye. “I heard about what happened to your brother.”

Eli scoffed. “That big dummy did it to himself.”

“See, that's how it starts. First you start giving ‘em equal time. Moral equivocation, and all that crap, like when they used to put Nazi’s and shit on Jerry Springer? You start giving Purps the benefit of the doubt and you’re halfway to saying all this was okay. No, dude - it was a Purp with a whip in her hand, and there’s just no excusing it. Right is right, and wrong is wrong.” 

Eli was quiet for a moment, frowning down at the plywood sheeting that made up the floor. “You really think so?”

Logan set down the spool of wire he’d been working with and sighed. “Look… Eil. Let me be straight with you. You liked that story I told you about that girl well enough, right? That wasn’t easy - it was a whole hour of sticking to my guns. And you never know which way it will go when you’re in the thick of it. But this stuff with the Shil? You gotta dig deep. You have to know you’re doing the right thing by not giving up, not giving in. All the time, every day. Not. One. *Inch.”*

The man’s eyes bored into his own, and Eli felt… 

Small. 

Well, not small *exactly.* It almost felt like looking up at the sky on a winter night. Like he was in the presence of something… *big.* Bigger than him, certainly.

That hadn’t happened in a long time.

“Look, I can see this is something you have to chew on, so let me put it to you another way. Your brother, right? You just got done calling him an idiot a second ago. Would you be cool with *me* doing that? What about a stranger? Of course not - he’s family. Outsiders don’t get to fuck with family.” He shrugged. “Well… this is like that. Sooner or later you have to fight for your own, with everything you’ve got. Think about it a while, because a grown man has to know what side of the line he’s on.”

Still feeling slightly overwhelmed, Eli gave a single nod. Logan smiled, returned the nod, and patted him on the shoulder. “You’re a good guy, Eli. I like you. Just keep the faith and you’ll grow into the man your family needs you to be. Like that gal of yours. She’ll see it, too.”

The sense of wonder turned to ice in his gut, but he nodded again. 

“Right!” Logan clapped his hands together. “Nearly quitting time. Let’s clean up. I’ve got a date with a good meal over at the Garden of Eatin’.”

“Right! Yeah, sorry. On it.” 

The remainder of the day passed in silence. He was still feeling off balance when he climbed into the cab of Ol’ Theseus. Levi wrestled the truck into gear and they rattled onto the road, headed out of town.

“Levi?”

“Hm?”

“Was digging out the swimming hole worth it?”

Levi glanced over sharply. “What?”

“I’m serious.”

Levi grew quiet as he turned back to the road. The hum of the tires filled the silence, and Eli began to wonder if his brother would answer.

“I don’t know,” Levi stated eventually, face folded into a thoughtful frown. “I might not know for a long time…”

Eli snorted. “A good candidate for things to fix with a time machine, then, huh?”

“No.” Levi shook his head. “I’d do it again. I’d do it *all* again. Every time. I just don’t know how much it actually cost yet.”

\---

The Garden of Eatin’.

If ever there was a prime spot for infiltrating a town, the Garden was heaven on Earth. Like most small towns across the America-That-Was with more than two churches and a gas station, you got someplace like the Garden. If you wanted to know the heart and soul of a place, that was where you went for a burger on Monday through Saturday, with biscuits and gravy after the first service on Sunday.

Also, the cherry pie was pretty damned good, and Louise the waitress gave him a wink now and then. 

All and all, it was the best of all worlds.

Logan settled himself onto a stool at the counter, mouth watering at the smell of the coffee as Louise filled the mug. The usually cheery face of the waitress was set with a worried cast. He followed one of her errant glances to note round-about fifteen years worth of stormy trouble seated at the counter just two stools down. The girl wore a dark scowl, and was smashing french fries on her plate with her thumb.

Louise gave him an apologetic glance, and he shrugged.

“Evening, sweetie,” the waitress said. “What can I getcha?”

Logan put on his best smile. “A burger and a coke, if you would, Lou. With everything.”

The girl’s scowl remained fixed on her plate as Louise paused to check with her before she vanished into the kitchen. Logan had put high-school level bullshit behind him a long time ago, but Louise seemed to like the kid, and it paid to look like a standup guy in any small town where folks got to know you by name - even if it was an alias. Besides, something about the girl seemed… familiar.

By the time his food arrived, she’d reduced the fries to a thin coating of starchy paste covering half her plate, and had turned her attention to the remains of a half-eaten burger. Louise looked like she was going to say something, but then moved off with a shake of her head.

High-school fucking bullshit.

Taking a bite of burger, Logan considered his options. Louise knew the kid, and it paid to look like you fit in. Show a little attention - not enough to look like you were getting too friendly, but a little conversation went a long way. 

Besides, you never knew where important information might come from.

Clearing his throat, he leaned over. “I think it’s dead.”

*‘God damn!’*

If looks could kill, Logan probably would’ve died long before making it through puberty. Nonetheless, the expression on the girl’s face as she turned to glare at him could probably have been weaponized in Afghanistan. 

“Do I know you?”

“Name’s Logan, so I expect you do now.” He put his hands up in surrender, and nodded at the plate. “Figured I’d say hi before you broaden your quest for vengeance. You look like you could use a friend, and Lou’s still handling the dinner rush.”

“I’m not interested in friends.” The venom practically dripped from her words. “Sorry.”

“Fair enough. Just trying to pay a kindness forward. A few more days and I’ll be finishing my job before I head to one waiting for me in Sacramento, so you’ll never even need to look at my ugly mug again.” 

There. Conversation achieved - and if anyone came looking for him, they could start in the wrong direction.

“Sacramento?” The girl’s frown changed flavor. “You’re from California?”

“I work contracts, mostly, but if I like it there, I’ll stay. I hear it’s nice. Ocean and warm weather all year round. I grew up in Alaska. Lots of snow, lots of cold. Never felt the need to go back, once I put it behind me.”

“Oh…” Her face fell. “I just… yeah. Cold and snow. Sure.” She turned back to her burger with a sigh. “A girl can dream, I guess.”

“Well, dreams are free, ma’am.” He pointed with his burger. “Sooner or later you either make ‘em happen or you get used to what you’ve got. I never cared for just sitting back and being satisfied with something, but if you’ve got to…” He shrugged. “The pie’s pretty good.”

The fire in her eyes flared. “It’s not *my* fault my stupid sister hooked up with a loser and a freak!”

Well, shit. He was in it now. Maybe Louise would come back soon. “A loser and a freak, huh? I don’t know the details, but isn’t that something to take up with your parents? My dad would have threatened anyone who fit that description with a shotgun if they’d come sniffing around my sister.”

“My dad *likes* them. Both of them! It’s disgusting!”

“Well, I expect he likes your sister, despite her behavior. Part of being a parent - or so I hear.”

“Not *her*, I mean Rhe’alla,” she said hotly. “My sister has hooked up with this dumb farm boy, and yes, he *is* a loser, but they’ve both hooked up with a Shil’vati girl, but do you think my useless father says *anything* about it? No, he’s *fine* with them! No, *I’m* the one who’s the piece of shit! I’m the once who’s the problem!”

Logan’s eyebrows rose. “Ah… that does sound like a bit of a mess.” This girl had just gotten a whole lot more interesting, but it was the ‘live grenade’ kind of interesting. “You’re right to be concerned, in that case. If your father’s not looking out for your safety, or your sisters, maybe you should leave instead of her? I mean, do you have family somewhere you could stay with?”

“I’ve got a great aunt in Maryland who’s like a billion years old, but winter sucks there.” Chloe huffed with all the feigned indifference a teenager could manage, failing miserably. “Besides, we aren't close, so I guess it doesn’t matter.”

Logan suppressed a grimace and willed Louise to turn around so he could catch her eye. Hopefully she’d come riding to the rescue soon. His coffee was running low. “The neighborhood’s gone down hill a bit in  Maryland during the last few years, too.” She looked at him quizzically, but he waved her off. “Not important. If that’s not an option, well… there’s always college scholarships, right?”

“Now you just sound like my father!” Chloe threw down her napkin in a huff, her glare dialed back up to eleven. “I guess I’m just going to stay here till I die, then, is that it!?”

Logan pursed his lips. The conversation was way more than he’d bargained for. Besides, if everything went according to plan, then her problem… well, it might just work itself out. Bit of a win-win. Not that he could say so, so he just sort of shrugged. 

“Well great! That’s just great! Thank you, Mister Logan, for a whole lot of *nothing!*”

She stormed off, practically running for the door.

Louise wandered back and he offered her a wan smile.

1isyfqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1isyfqa/you_may_not_be_a_light_roast_person_and_thats_okay/,"You may not be a light roast person, and that's okay","A lot of coffee nerds online wax poetic about their light roasts. About how the fruitiness, juiciness, subtle flavor profile and origin characteristics are lost when the bean is roasted too much. They talk about how much dimension a cup of coffee can have, and what the rest of us are missing out on with our over-roasted coffee beans. Some of them even make it sound like dark roasting a coffee bean ruins it.



They say these things with great conviction, and I listened to them.



I bought fresh, specialty light roasted whole coffee beans, ground them by hand, meticulously brewed them to the specifications of these wise coffee nerds, and drank the resulting coffee every morning, mindfully singling out the various qualities that I enjoyed in each cup. I did this for over a week.



And what I realized this: I really hate acidity in my coffee. And I don't care for fruitiness at all.



Are those things novel to me as a coffee drinker? Yes. They're different, interesting even, but I don't like them. I want my coffee to have notes of roasted nuts, chocolate, caramel, and graham cracker; not cherry, or plum, or apple! I want very little, if any, acidity in my cup. I don't want juiciness. I don't want any tea like qualities. I don't want any distractions in my cup: just simple, essential, classic tasting, unsweetened black coffee.



And there's nothing wrong with that. Sometimes simple is best, and I will content myself with my dark roasted beans from now on.",5,1739944418.0,pourover,4,0.65,False

1isyeg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1isyeg2/am_i_a_bad_roommate/,Am I a bad roommate?,"So, for context, I'm a college student at a school with a three year residency requirement so have lived in the on campus residential halls as a freshman and now as a sophomore. It's two people to every room and you share the bathroom with another set of two roommates. At some point during my first or second semester of college I started constantly worrying about being a bad roommate. I felt like I was closer to my freshman year roommate at the beginning of the year but as time went on we stopped hanging out and hardly talked to each other. I was especially worried because at the beginning of the year she outright stated in the event of a conflict she wouldn't say anything if there was some sort of conflict but would just hold a grudge instead. I don't think that's very fair but I still wanted to be a good roommate. She asked me once to clean my hair out of the sink (which I did, ofc) one time but that's it as far as I can remember regarding asking me to do things. I probably hadn't really thought we'd room together again anyways but found out when she posted a photo of one of her friends on her story with the text ""So proud of my future roomie!"" Now she acts like I don't exist. At the beginning of this sophomore year I passed by her in one of the academic buildings, said hi and waved, and she gave a tiny wave and tight lipped smile that wasn't really a smile back. She doesn't acknowledge me when she sees me. I saw her at the campus coffee shop and tried to give a polite wave. Her boyfriend waved back a bit but she wouldn't even look at me. It drives me crazy wondering what I did wrong. 
My new roommate seems warmer/friendlier. I like her but I'm scared she doesn't like me. I feel like it's a similar-ish situation where we also talked more at the beginning of the year. She also said at the beginning of the year when I asked her to please tell me if there was ever an issue that she is a people pleaser/avoids confrontation, so once again I'm in the position of fearing there's an issue that's not being discussed. There's only so much I can do if I don't realize I'm doing something wrong. But not being told doesn't stop others from being unhappy with you when you do those things, of course. I tried to check in at the beginning of this semester and asked if, now that we've lived together for a semester, there's anything I could do to be a better roommate. She said there wasn't, said I respect her space, but I felt like she was holding something back. She talks to her parents over FaceTime almost everyday so I get some insight into her life and recently she's seemed more frustrated/burnt out/aggravated in general, and earlier today was talking to her mom about wanting to go stay at someone else's place over the weekend and about how she doesn't like people (in general), so I fear she's trying to avoid our room and I aggravate her or have made it stifling or unpleasant in here somehow. Here's some possible issues she could have with me:

1. I'm generally kind of messy. However, I do keep the messiness confined to my own space, I think. If I need to move stuff over that could be in her way while I'm tidying up something or other or maybe packing a suitcase I try to do it while she's out of the room. A couple times I've had to apologize for something temporarily being somewhere that could be in her way but I don't think she minded. A few weeks ago when my side of things was especially messy I apologized and she said it was all good in a friendly way that sounded genuine enough. On this same point, I'm not very on top of cleaning up after myself, but again, I've always felt like this manifests in ways that don't affect her. I've had a big ol pile of laundry that needs taken care of for some time now but it lives under my bed, most or all of it out of sight. Unless I'm completely nose blind I don't think it has any sort of smell or anything. 
2. The other main thing regarding cleanliness is dishes. There's a shared sink in the bathroom but nobody would leave dishes in there -- I say that just to be clear that I'm not leaving dishes in our sink or anything. I have a drying rack which I actually use to hold dirty dishes versus as an actual drying rack. I'm not sure where else to put those dishes or where else to put the drying rack itself but it's on top of the microwave. So far it's better this semester but last semester I would leave dirty dishes there for a long time. Again, don't think there was a smell - I sure do hope not. When I'm living at home I'm in charge of doing dishes and I get them done but here it's harder for some reason. I'm a kind of high anxiety person (...that point may have already come across) and general college stuff is very overwhelming and I also have some sensory sensitivities and think stuck on food is gross and hate looking at it, and scraping it off, and things being wet. I also worry I won't clean them well enough and there will be germs left and I get some contamination anxiety with dealing with dirty dishes. Combine all these things and you can see why I'm avoidant when it comes to the dishes. I've always seen it as since the drying rack is mine and it's not a sink or anything like that she also uses it wouldn't bother her, but might it? What do yall think?
3. Hair in the shower - Naturally, hair falls out in the shower and will sit on top of the drain. Literally 3/4 of us girls in the suite have blonde hair so it's very hard to tell whose is on the drain and therefore whose responsibility it is to clean it up. At home where I grew up my drain was different so idk the best way to clean this one. Usually I grab a toothpick and attempt to scoop it up, then shake that hair off into the trash and go back for what's left. This is rather inefficient. Idk how other people deal with this. When I looked it up all I got is tips for dealing with hair that's in the drain, not resting on top of the grate. I think I'm going to get a drain catcher thingy the next time I'm at a store that sells one and I can put it down before I shower and maybe this won't be an issue anymore. Anyway, I have the longest hair of anyone in the suite so I don't know if maybe most of the hair is mine and therefore she would want me to clean it up more consistiently.
4. Sometimes when I go down the hall to fill my water bottle or down a few stories to the laundry room I won't close the door all the way. If you open the door and then turn the lock on the inside it creates a sort of door stop. If the door isn't closed all the way it means I don't have to take my student card with me to swipe back into the room and therefore have another thing to carry and keep track of. If our dorm opened to the outside I would not do that, trust me, but you need to be a student with a student card to get inside the residential buildings in the first place. Maybe I'm naive but I have enough faith in the other student residents to not go into our room and/or steal something while I'm gone for a few minutes. The roommate last year seemed fine with this and would do it herself (I learned the whole door stop thing from her). But yesterday after I'd done this, I forgot to shut the door again when I got back which I don't think I've done any other time? Maybe once or twice. It's not typical, at least, but my roommate gets back like 10ish min later and she's like, ""Did you know this was open?"" She didn't seem mad but perhaps concerned. So now I'm wondering if maybe I should ask if she's actually chill with me doing that.
5. At the beginning of the year especially we had some issues with, I think, me setting alarms for earlier than she wanted to wake up. Totally valid, and the solution we found was me getting one of those alarm clocks that wakes you up with vibrations under your pillow instead of noise. It works alright for me but there was a point recently where I set a phone alarm to make certain I woke up on time for something or other because the vibrations don't wake me up as well as sound does. I realized this morning the alarm was still going off in the mornings and I think it's been doing that for several days. I haven't been waking up enough to notice it until now, even with the vibrations (I do not wake up easily). And like, I'm not sure how often this has happened. Does she stop it herself after awhile or does it just go on indefinitely bothering her? Fortunately I think on weekdays this semester she usually has class before I do but I saw that the alarm was set for Saturdays, too! Of course, I turned it off. 

Obviously, there could be something not even on my radar causing issues. I grew up an only child so between that and my occasional obliviousness I'm afraid there are things I never learned about how to properly live with other people. Hopefully it's true that there's nothing. I know I have things I need to work on (and I'm doing better with stuff like the dishes and recently finished an intensive outpatient therapy program) but I hope these are things that have affected her minimally as my roommate. Please be honest with me but not too harsh if you can help it. I'd appreciate constructive feedback if y'all have it. Especially if you guys have learned ways to balance dealing with anxiety, ADHD, depression, and generally treacherous and unpredictable mental health with being a good roommate.",1,1739944284.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

Huge help for planning my trip - I pretty much just used this sub-reddit to plan. Just got back from what ended up being a super fun trip even though it didn't follow any of my initial plans.

I'd include my planned itinerary but that got completely blown up by weather delays in Las Vegas of all places and this is going to be plenty long as is. Here's what I ended up doing along with thoughts on it: 

  
Thursday: Get stuck in vegas for 8 extra hours and re-routed on a red eye through dallas. Leave the airport and eat at the new Lotus of Siam location (food is good but not quite the one of the best meal I've ever had level that the original restaurant was - get the Nam khao tod though and thank me later)

Friday - Show up in NO at 6 in the morning and sleep for three hours before we wake up hungry. Staying at OId 77 in the warehouse district so we got some coffee and wandered down Magazine street to the garden district

Friday AM meal - Molly's Rise and Shine. Super good, very hipster, just embraced the atmosphere and enjoyed a great breakfast sandwich, fried chicken sandwich and a lox hashbrown chives side with poached eggs that was perfect for our sleep deprived selves. 

Wandered the garden district and continued down Magazine st before bopping up and catching the St Charles street car back towards the French Quarter. Went to Erin Rose for some refreshments (Frozen Irish coffee with an extra shot), hung out with some locals from Texas (met a lot of those over the weekend). Loved Erin Rose, super friendly bar tenders and a nice respite from the Bourbon St vibes - would have stayed longer but it was only 2pm. Wandered the FQ for a bit and then went back to regroup before heading out to Crew Boheme. Watched them on Frenchmen street, super fun and then grabbed beignets on our way home at Cafe du Monde (mediocre food but a fun experience)

Saturday: Beignets at Lorettas Prailenes - Much better beignets than Cafe du Monde but convinced me that they just aren't my jam. 

Lunch: Lil Dizzy's - Got fried chicken, smothered pork chops with sides of greens, dirty rice and mac and cheese. So good! This was probably the most memorable meal of the trip in terms of defining a whole genre of food for us. Tasted the way that I always had wanted soul food to taste. Great food and super friendly people. 

After that took the bus up to the statue garden and wandered around the park for awhile. Was planning on eating at Parkway but Lil Dizzy's had filled us up for the long haul. Took the street car back towards the hotel.

Dinner: Peche at the bar - walked in early and were able to snag seats at the bar. Had ceviche, fried oysters and catfish - All great with very tasty cocktails and friendly service. Highly recommend.

Went to Crew du Vieux on Frenchman St, super fun and impressive with the amount of effort and creativity everyone put in, had a late night wander snack at Sylvain of cabbage salad, ribs and delicious cocktails which was exactly what we needed. Not a destination but good solid food with a fun vibe in the middle of the quarter.

Sunday: Took the bus to Bywater, ate breakfast at Bywater Bakery: Food was good? Focaccia was amazing, grits and bacon were good but not noteworthy. Probably wouldn't seek it out but it was solid and the people watching was entertaining. Was feeling a little FOMO on Elizabeth's but it seems like this subreddit has been giving bad reviews on them recently so I feel fine about missing it. Went to Dr Bob's, a record shop, Mortal Machine Gallery, Antenna Gallery and then caught the CTC Steppers second line by Night Bloom. Sunday lunch was two beers from a cooler at the second line. Went to Studio Be after that, which was amazing- highly recommend, great art and an incredible story. Walked back towards the FQ, stumbled across Tit Rex parade which was pretty entertaining, had drinks at Pepp's Pub and OK snacks from the food truck there.

Dinner: Compere Lapin: This happened to be in our hotel but it was an amazing dinner. I've seen mixed reviews and I could see how some parts of the restaurant are a little sloppy (The bartenders are grumpy, the hosting feels a little loose, and the mixed drinks aren't that great) but the actual meal we had there was amazing. We had the biscuits, papaya salad, pork belly and curried goat with sweet potato gnocchi. 

TLDR: 

Go to: Lil Dizzy's, Peche and Compre Lapin. Also Studio Be

Probably go to: Erin Rose,  Molly's Rise and Shine, CTC Steppers dude with a cooler (2 for 1 Budweiser)

Also good: Bywater Bakery, Sylvain, Pepp's Pub

Skip: Beignets

Thanks again on all your help here and congratulations on living in such an amazing town! Can't wait to come back and try the other 30 places I have on my list that I didn't get to.

1isybwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1isybwg/welcome_to_the_puppet_show/,Welcome to the Puppet Show,"It started with a string on my husband’s hand. He was handing me my morning coffee–one shot, lots of foamed milk, extra hot. As my fingers closed around the mug, I noticed the golden thread coming out of the back of his hand, trailing toward the ceiling.

Obviously, I looked up.

The thread was so thin and delicate, only visible where the steam from the mug hit it just right. I quickly lost sight of it in the air.

“Monica, are you alright?”

I blinked, my husband’s words drawing me out of a contemplative trance I hadn’t realized I had fallen into. He was waving his hand in front of my face, and there was–of course–no string in sight.

I desperately needed that coffee.

Three days later, I saw the second string. We were sitting at the kitchen table, and my husband was five minutes into an ode to the keto diet. I tuned him out, staring absently at the space just above his head. That was when I noticed a golden glint in his brown hair. It was a thread, moving up and down in rhythm with his lips. An intrusive thought wormed its way in.

I reached across the table, grabbed the thread, and *pulled up.*

His jaw snapped shut. I let go.

“–what everyone misunderstands about ketosis–”

I pulled again. His jaw closed again. His hands continued gesticulating, as if he were still speaking. Above his fingers, ten threads glinted intermittently.

*What the hell?*

I jumped to my feet, my chair clattering to the floor. How had I never noticed them before? Golden threads pulling on every one of my husband’s limbs, taut and vertical, shimmering as their periodic movement caught the light.

“Is something wrong?” his mouth said, the thread at the top of his head sliding up and down.

I looked around for the closest weapon–a pair of scissors on the counter. I grabbed them and pointed them at him. “What–what are you?” I asked. “What did you do with Roy?”

Threads danced, and the thing that looked like my husband stood up.

“Whoa,” he said. “Monica, give me the scissors.” A thread tugged his hand, and it moved toward me.

Without thinking, I snipped the thread.

His wrist immediately went limp. He didn’t seem to notice.

“Maybe you should sit down,” he said, as another thread tried to sling his arm around my shoulders. I snipped that one, too, and his arm fell heavily to his side.

Then I was cutting frenziedly, the blades of my scissors snapping at every unnatural glimmer in the air. His limbs dropped down one by one. Finally, I cut the thread above his head, and his body collapsed to the floor like a pile of sticks.

I stood over him, panting. I caught my distorted reflection in the mirrored finish of the refrigerator door. Wide eyes, wild hair, and, above my head, a flash of something golden. I positioned my scissors over my head, and–

1isy1es,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/1isy1es/from_unsuccessful_gmat_attempts_to_a_gre_330_q170/,"From unsuccessful GMAT attempts to a GRE 330! (Q170, V160) Debrief","
Hi all,
When I had envisioned sharing a debrief here earlier, it really wasn’t at all this way. I have always dreamt of pursuing an MBA, and my GMAT journey began as early as 2021 – and three attempts (and a half – where I prepped but just gave up on the idea of an MBA) later, I am so glad that I finally have a decent score for my dream schools. I gave the GRE recently and received a score of Q170, V160.


My GRE Journey: spanning roughly 2 months
	1.	Early Dec: Started practicing vocabulary from Magoosh flashcards, talked to 10-15 friends, researched on what worked and what didn’t for their GRE. I had a strong background in quants because of my preparation for GMAT.
	2.	Mid dec – Mid Jan: Subscribed to Gregmat, started prepping. I used Prepswift (Gregmat) for all the verbal strategies and for brushing up Quants (particularly geometry, word problems, Statistics and P&C)
	3.	Mid Jan – Mid feb: Practised a lot, gave mocks, used all the official material I had. Continuously filled my error log and improved – built a stamina of focusing well for 2 hours and a habit of revising effectively.


Resources:
Study sources: Gregmat (vocab cards, quant cards, video material), previous notes from my GMAT preparation (E-gmat, Magoosh, etc)

Practise resources:
       1.    ETS Big Book
	2.	GRE ETS Official book
	3.	ETS GRE Verbal Reasoning
	4.	ETS Quantitative Reasoning
	5.	Gregmat: Mini quizzes + skill building

Mocks:
	1.	ETS Official papers
	2.	Gregmat
	3.	Official Practise Papers  (ETS book)
	4.	Manhattan/Kaplan (free ones)


Mock scores:
Before beginning my preparation: 318 (Manhattan), 313 (ETS)
During: 325 (ETS), 327 (ETS), 324 (ETS), 323 (Gregmat)
(I was mentally prepared to receive a score between 320-325)


After ups and downs with my health, I made sure that I don’t let stress get the best of me, here are some things that helped me focus holistically:
	1.	Prioritised my well-being, because I knew stress becomes counterproductive for me.

What helped in the process?
	1.	Movement/Exercise – happy hormones hehe
	2.	Journalling
	3.	Breathework (occasionally did this)
	4.	Spending time with friends/family
	5.	A decent sleep routine


Other things that I focused on:
	1.	Building a focus stamina – basically I tended to get distracted, so really to just practice for 2 hours and completely focus on one thing.
	2.	Building a routine/planning my schedule well
 
Biggest shoutout to @gregmat! I have hardly ever come across preparation material that has such a high return on investment! Thank you for making this affordable, and thanks for all that you and your team do – replying on subreddits/hosting live sessions/coffee chats and just for making the entire experience, a little bit fun? Really grateful for you – thank you!

If this message finds you, I just hope it reminds you that things work out (sometimes very differently from what we imagined), and please don’t let a test get the best of your mental health. Lots of best wishes to everyone who’s preparing! x",3,1739942947.0,GRE,1,1.0,False

Second bedroom is occupied by 7 yo. So me my husband and 13 month old share a room and it is HELL to me. Baby is the lightest sleeper. I hate my room and relationship with sleep.

My husband only works 3 long days but those nights before he needs good sleep as is he is a short haul truck driver and his alarm is set for 3:30a.m.

13 mo consistently has been waking up before husbands 3:30 alarm goes off (between 11-2?) for unknown reason. What we’ve been doing is I get up and go downstairs to living room quickly with baby as soon as he wakes while my husband keeps the bedroom. And then even if we manage to fall asleep downstairs…me and baby are always awoken at 3:30 a.m when husband comes down to make coffee.

Question: Should I ask my husband to sleep on the couch nights he has to work? Or is that selfish? Should I deal with sleeping in living room with woken infant since he pays all the rent, groceries etc?

We had some interest in each other last year. We didn’t go past a kiss, though. I ghosted him for basically half a year because I lost TWO jobs within a short time span and was overcome with devastation. During this period of ghosting, he reached out and arranged a date, but I cancelled due to extreme stress. I assumed he’d just lose interest in me at this point. He’s an attractive man who could easily find someone else.

After I got semi-over this career grievance, I reached out and he was still open to hanging out with me during his lunch break. Finally, we talked over coffee. We hugged and I gave him a little peck on the side of his neck before turning my back to go to work.

We didn’t see each other again for another two weeks. His birthday passed during this time, so I offered to take him out to dinner via text. When we met up again, he asked, “Hey, did you kiss me on the neck last time?” I giggled and said yes. He joked about it and then switched the subject, as if his curiosity was satisfied.

Maybe I just have a shit memory, but I was impressed that he could even remember without having mentioned it over text. Personally, I couldn’t have remembered something like that unless it gave me butterflies in my stomach. 

Is it presumptuous of me to interpret this as a chance that he still likes me? I’m nervous about this situationship because I thought I’d ruined whatever chemistry we used to have by ghosting him. ",1,1739942581.0,dating_advice,2,0.99,False
1isxxir,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1isxxir/an_analogy_for_bpd/,An analogy for BPD,"So I’m M23 recently diagnosed with BPD and I came up with an analogy that makes it sound less scary. A lot of people make a general assumption that BPD means abusive maniac, detached psychopath, or mood killer. The way I like to explain it is this:

BPD is like an “It’s so over / We’re so back” mentality that is hardwired into me.

“It’s so over”
Lets I gets snapped at at work by an angry customer and they want to speak to the boss, I’m going to think “they hate me, I suck, I’m gonna lose my job, nobody will believe me, is this is my fault somehow, I always ruin everything ” etc. the average Joe just thinks “wow that person is a jerk, they had a bad day, it’s whatever”. The average Joe will continue about his day and let the issue go. I on the other hand am silently going insane. I’m just waiting for the boss to come over and fire me even though it’s extremely unlikely that that is going to happen. That night I also notice my hours got cut next week. It HAS to be because of that run in with the customer (it’s so over).

“We’re so back”
I return to work 3 days later and the manager greets me on the way in and says “good to see you! Sorry for the light hours this week, we have some new people training and not a lot of business projected because of the incoming weather so we thought we’d use time to train them when it’s not a madhouse in here!” Now I’m good. I am so back.

This cycle of events playing out day after day can be exhausting and leads to a sense of emptiness and fear. Because of this, I have trouble expressing my needs and opening up. I tell them that it leads to a deep fear of abandonment or loss. Everything good at some point will be stripped away.

People with BPD tend to be overwhelmingly empathetic and hyper vigilant of the emotions of the people around them, sometimes to their own detriment. That time you left the room and I was worried? I didn’t think you were cheating, I thought that I angered you. That time I made coffee and my coworkers didn’t finish it? They hate me and want me to quit.

DISCLAIMER!
I have relatively quiet BPD so this may not be entirely accurate for everyone. This is just my personal experience.

--------------------------

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/VOvXeATecd): **February 11, 2025**

I plan on sending this post to my husband once the verdict is in, whichever way it goes, so I’ll add as much of his perspective as I can.

Our toddler was sick through the weekend. I was up with him one night from 12:15-2:45, and off and on the next night. I probably got 10-12 hours of broken sleep the whole weekend.

Yesterday, my husband mentioned he was starting to feel a little sick. Last night I went to bed early hoping to catch up on rest. All throughout the night, my husband woke me up way more often than my toddler ever does, even on a bad night. Some of the times were not directly his fault, but other times I felt like he was being inconsiderate.

1: He snored loudly in my ear.

2: He asked for another blanket because he had the chills. I told him it was at the foot of the bed. He asked for help and reminded me that he helps me when I’m sick, and that he’d still do the morning routine with our son.

3: He had a nightmare I had to shake him awake from. (normal)

4: He whispered at Alexa to ask for the time.

5: He asked for another blanket. I gave him mine.

6: He made a phone call (in bed) and left a full volume voicemail to his work to let them know he’d need to take a sick day.

7: At 5:30 in the morning, he woke me to ask if I could do the wake up routine with our son. (I do bedtime, he does wake up.)

At this point I blew up. I expressed how mad I was that he woke me up all night long, and now I have to wake up early to do what he said he’d still do, and I don’t get to stay home and catch up on sleep. He said I was in the wrong because marriage is in sickness and in health. I immediately got up to get ready. He said I didn’t have to start getting ready so early, I said yes I did because I start work at 7:30. I barely make it to work on time when I wake up at 6:00, and now I have to unexpectedly skip my shower, get my toddler ready, get his food ready for the day, feed him breakfast, drop him off at daycare, then take myself to work.

I said he was a grown man with a cold, and he robbed me of the rest I needed, and that I’ll be sleeping on the couch tonight. At that point I asked for space and we haven’t talked since. I was late for work which is a big deal at my job.

I might be the asshole for blowing up at my husband when he asked for support during an unexpected illness. Am I the asshole for being mad at my sick husband?

**Verdict: Not the Asshole**

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** INFO? Does he skip out on toddler duty often?

As much as I understand your frustration, it should only be that. There wasn't really any reason to get mad at him unless this is something that happens all the time. I think he was a little inconsiderate with volume, but otherwise, it does just sound like he's sick. Give him a break now, and ask that, when he feels better, he covers a ""shift"" for you (as long as that means, when you're sick, you're also gonna cover his ""shifts"" after you feel better).

> **OOP:** No he doesn’t, but he does have a bad habit of waking me up. Once I’m up, I’m UP and have a very hard time falling back asleep. My husband snores and gets night terrors regularly, so we have slept separately on and off for years. He volunteers to sleep on the couch. I feel bad about it, but at least one of us should be getting decent sleep, especially now that we have a toddler. But he always ends up back in bed because he gets lonely on the couch.
> 
> I wasn’t mad that he was sick. I was mad that he didn’t arrange for me to take over morning duty the night before. If I had known that he’d need help, I would have woken up 30 minutes earlier than I did. I was mad that he woke me up all night long when I’m already in a sleep debt.

**Commenter 2:** Nta. Hands would have been thrown if my sleep was interrupted this frequently. But I sleep alone, with dnd on all day and I don’t like people. He would have been sleeping in the sickroom with the toddler.

Coffee and sleep. The two most sacred things in life and I hope you didn’t miss your coffee while racing out the door with the little!

I am listening and I am judging.

> **OOP:** I absolutely missed the chance to make my own food and caffeine, because I only had time to get Toddler ready. So I was hungry, exhausted without caffeine to help, and my hair was gross on top of being late. Terrible day after a terrible night.

**Commenter 3:** NTA- It’s one thing if you slept all night and he was up all night sick and he woke you up and asked you to handle the morning routine. It’s another when he’s willfully kept you awake. Waking you up for extra blankets, asking the time and making a loud phone call is absolutely willful behavior from him. Your angry feelings are valid.

If this is a one time thing, when he’s better, circle back and have a discussion. If this is his typical “man flu/cold” behavior, he needs to stop it. Sleep deprivation is cruel.

**Commenter 4:** NTA 100%.. How do you wake someone up to get a blanket (at the foot of the bed!?) and start making phone calls in bed when someone is sleeping? I mean that is just rude! If he doesn't know where the blankets are in the home, why? does he not live there?

**Commenter 5:** NTA. Being sick, working and caring for a sick child is terrible. But your husband is an adult and needs to be somewhat self sufficient and considerate. He can’t help that he had a nightmare or snored, but waking you up for a blanket twice, asking for the time, and taking/making calls in the early hours from bed is incredibly self-centered.

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Magical-Princess/s/E47hkbIHsm): **February 12, 2025 (next day)**

Requested info and update:

“He’s sick. Be nice.” I agree, and I also felt unwell. I was never mad at him for being sick. I was mad about the wake ups and the last minute change in plans that could have been avoided with better communication. Grace and empathy should go both ways.

“Wait until it’s your turn to be sick.” We have been together 10+ years and we each have the same standard of self sufficiency, but we generally help each other when sick: soup, tea, meds, the works… within reason! Extra TLC is appreciated, but we’re not children. Never have I ever woken him up repeatedly throughout the night. This was an unusual situation that was exacerbated by my sleep debt and his sudden symptoms.

”Why didn’t he help you over the weekend?” He DID help a lot during the daytime on the weekend to give me rest breaks because I did the overnight wake ups, but that does not include naps. I find it extremely difficult to take naps and he knows it. My mind just doesn’t turn off until bedtime. He generally can’t help with the overnights because of a legitimate medical condition that could worsen with repeated lack of sleep. Husband does all the wake ups and lets me sleep in on the weekends to make up for the overnights.

“Why didn’t you sleep in the guest room?” We don’t have one anymore. “Why didn’t you take the couch if he was sick?” Symptoms didn’t hit hard until after we went to sleep, which is why we didn’t initially sleep separately or change the morning arrangements the night before.

“Why didn’t you take the couch after the first few wake ups?” I’m used to a few wake ups. I wasn’t expecting the next five. Once I’m physically up, I’m mentally UP. If I had gotten up from the bed, it would have been difficult to go back to sleep at that point.

“Does he have sleep apnea?” I have suggested to him in the past that he does and should do a sleep study. He hasn’t yet and I’m not going to make an appointment for him.

“Snoring and nightmares aren’t his fault!” I already said they weren’t. The nightmares are regular for him - we sleep separately often because of them, per my request. We’ll go months sleeping apart, but then he’ll say that he doesn’t sleep well alone, and since we only have the couch as a separate sleep space, I often cave and let him sleep with me again. He doesn’t let me take the couch.

“Why did you take a sick child to daycare?” Daycare’s policy is 24 hours fever free without other symptoms or medication.

“I could never be married to you. You’re so selfish.” I wasn’t taking applications… but can you feel that sexual tension between us, or is that just me?

Update: Husband saw the comments and guaranteed me uninterrupted sleep going forward. I again offered to sleep on the couch, but he insisted he take it and the baby monitor. As a compromise, we’ll be sleeping separately on weeknights, and together on weekends, unless I need to catch up on sleep or if one of us is sick.

After seeing all perspectives, including Husband’s, I’ll agree with an ESH verdict with me being 20% the asshole. I had a right to be mad, but I should not have blown up. He should be able to ask for help, but within reason. I apologized for being snappy. He apologized for the wake ups. No divorce lawyers necessary.
 
**Top Comments** 

**Commenter 1:** I dunno, I’ve only just read the original and I would’ve said NTA.

Sleep deprivation is very bad for us - and he was being extremely needy and inconsiderate. 3 bad night’s sleep in a row is rough - and it doesn’t sound like a normal night’s sleep is that great to start with. As someone who knows some Olympic level snorers, they always say, ‘but don’t judge meee - I can’t help it!’ It’s true, they can’t help it, but none of them take any responsibility for the havoc it wreaks on their partner. Well, one ex did, but he was not happy about needing to use a simple throat spray before bed. Stopped it dead though.

Glad all has been resolved though. It’s good to talk!

**Commenter 2:** See I was NTA for the original. Let’s all take a moment to remember sleep deprivation is a form or torture that is banned specifically in the Geneva Conventions.

That being said in glad y’all worked on a compromise. I hope it works out!

**Commenter 3:** He's TA for not dealing with his sleep apnea. I have been using a cpap for almost two decades and the difference is astonishing.

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!hostile workplace, victim blaming!<

[Original Post](https://www.askamanager.org/2017/05/my-coworker-tickled-another-coworker-and-now-there-is-chaos.html)  **May 2, 2017**

My company has had a relatively informal, somewhat relaxed working environment in the past, where colleagues generally got along well and we had a decent time together, even while working hard. Unfortunately, that balance has recently been upended in department I work in.

Two weeks ago, my coworker, Rachel, kicked the power strip under the desk in her cubicle, so she slipped off her heels and crawled under to pop it back in. The young woman in the cubicle behind her, Monica, had a serious lapse in judgment at this point; she knelt down and slipped an arm around Rachel’s ankles when she was vulnerable and began tickling her feet. It was an unusual moment, to say the least, and reactions ranged from amusement to mild horror.

(If you asked Monica, she would would say she only had a light hold to avoid getting kicked during a playful moment that went too far. If you asked Rachel, she’d say she was rendered largely immobile and humiliated. I didn’t have the best view, but it looked to me as though reality was closer to Rachel’s side.)

Our manager, Phoebe, rushed in after several seconds of laughing/shouting to break it up. It was a good thing she was there, because I thought for sure that Rachel was going to slug Monica otherwise! Phoebe walked Monica to HR, and we wondered if Monica was done for. Apparently, they allowed her to remain with the company, but told her she’d be dismissed if she put one toe out of line (heh).

I don’t know the details, but I do know that Rachel was furious that the girl wasn’t fired. Since that point, she has done everything she can to make Monica so unhappy that she feels compelled to quit, from passive-aggressive emails, to trying to rally coworkers to petition management to let her go, to bringing up “the incident” (as it’s come to be called) at every available opportunity. As a result, Rachel is becoming difficult to work with, and Monica is becoming a basket case. It’s gotten to the point where yesterday, I talked to Monica because I felt sorry for her (I’d heard her crying in the ladies’ room that morning) only to have Rachel snarl at me later for trying to be friendly.

I’m fairly certain that Phoebe knows what’s happening, but is hesitant to address the issue with Rachel since she was the original victim. Phoebe is also rather hands-off in management style, so that isn’t helping the situation.

The environment is becoming increasingly uncomfortable and our department being split on whether Monica should have been let go from the start hasn’t helped, and I can sense people starting to take sides. Any advice would be appreciated.

[Update](https://www.askamanager.org/2017/09/update-my-coworker-tickled-another-coworker-and-now-there-is-chaos.html)  **Sept 7, 2017 (5 months later)**

First and foremost, I want to thank you for taking the time to craft a thoughtful response to my letter.

Monica (the tickler) left the company last week. I don’t know all the details, but I reached out and she said that she and management “came to an understanding,” but wouldn’t say more, and I didn’t push.

She was a middle child in a large family that showed a lot of physical affection, and tickling wasn’t something vicious or mean as far as she was concerned, and it was probably that background that contributed to her lack of judgment. I won’t make excuses for her actions, but I really feel bad for her and hope she finds another position and that she can learn from her mistake instead of being punished for it further.

She is clearly an extrovert and feeling cut off from people and caught in an atmosphere of hostility and isolation really affected her, though how much pressure was from Rachel and how much, if any, came from higher-ups, I couldn’t say. I offered to have coffee and catch up, and if she takes me up on that, I might have more info in the future.

As for Rachel, once Monica was gone, some of my coworkers expected her to gloat or strut around, but she’s been awfully subdued. She doesn’t talk much about anything except work, even inconsequential things. Perhaps that will change, but it’s as if she didn’t know how to react once she got what she wanted. As far as I know, our manager never confronted her, though I won’t swear to that.

Things seem to be getting back to normal, otherwise. Our boss brought some treats, and we did a couple of fun group exercises, and people have relaxed a bit. Still, I’m wary of how quickly things can get deeply uncomfortable.

Thank you again for your time and your advice.

OpenAI is exploring a new governance structure that would grant special voting rights to select investors and board members to prevent hostile takeovers.

* OpenAI is contemplating giving unique voting rights to its non-profit board to maintain control as it counters an unsolicited acquisition attempt by Elon Musk, according to the Financial Times.
* CEO Sam Altman and board members are considering governance adjustments as OpenAI shifts towards a for-profit model, based on information from individuals familiar with the situation.
* On Friday, OpenAI refused a $97.4 billion buyout proposal from a group led by Musk, stating the company is not for sale and dismissing future offers as insincere.

**What this means:** This move follows increasing interest from tech billionaires and foreign investors to influence OpenAI's future, raising questions about its independence and leadership stability. \[[Learn More](https://www.bloomberg.com/)\] \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/02/18](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211)\]

[Weber KEY Mk1],"I've got the KEY Mk1 for quite a while and to be frank I hardly use it. Recently I started getting more into filter coffees (unfortunately this is the only grinder I have) and so I've taken it out for a bit more use.

There are some things that have been there since that day I've gotten the grinder from Weber.  
**(1) this weird grinding noise like the gear teeth are slipping or chipping on each other when the grinder is on. (I've heard/watched the review units sent to influencers and seen one at a coffee bar they don't have this sound)**  
**(2) the part above the grinder dial ring that seems to rock/move around when the grinder is turning.**

(edit) here's the video - [https://youtube.com/shorts/9Ydoxu8Uz00](https://youtube.com/shorts/9Ydoxu8Uz00)

Recently, I reached out again and sent over the same video attached here. They told me it's a non-issue.

I'd like to ask if it's me being stupid, in that case please tell me or is the grinder problematic? Would appreciate all your expertise please! thank you for your help!

(Also if anyone knows a setting to get the best filter coffee out of this thing, please do let me know haha would really appreciate it too)",1,1739941102.0,espresso,0,0.99,False
1isxgw0,https://i.redd.it/19n4jg8x11ke1.jpeg,The Walk Taxi Experience 🤠,"Happy Wednesday all,

For those who don't know, I'm Krishna from chennai and I walk and talk with people who seek company to walk and talk. Some want just the listener in me, while some want just the walker in me. So, it's a good gamble mutually tbh :) 

⚠️FYI: I don't charge anyone for walks. Anyone pretending to charge for walks isn't me. Thanks.

It's been over a year and I've learnt so much by walking with a mere amount of 10+ people. Well, even if the numbers appear small, I know how much it takes to make one session happen, how much trust goes behind etc.,

I have immense happiness over people who felt at ease after the walk, having vented out most things they wouldn't share with even their best friends or family. I, somehow being a stranger, felt so much gratitude for having earned trust over this period. I'm sure the trust grows much easily as my testimonials are available under my IG profile highlights for you all to go through ❤️

Although, there's been times when I've felt I can't take walk because, even if I can assume that, I have a good marginal difference with respect to listening than what a person can, from a stranger, I still do have a threshold. And I reached that point in January as I faced health issues since December end and other personal struggles. I'm currently on a break from walking strangers let alone friends.

However, I'm trying to overcome my tough days, and mental hardships through Yoga, Music and good spirited friends, in-person and online who comfort me to get going.

I'll be back from 2nd week of March 2025 to resume walks. This time, I'm also introducing the option for you all to help me facilitate these walks as there are expenses that are fundamental behind the scenes. You can donate either through Buy Me a Coffee link, which I'll attach below (not sure if this is allowed here, but I'd appreciate if the mods can accept this). I'm also attaching super basic expenses that are fundamental for me to make walks happen.

Also please let me know if there's an alternative platform where I can accept small funds from time to time without huge commissions. 🫂 Thanks nanbaas and nanbees for reading till this. I really can't thank you all enough for having garnered trust and love towards the 1st year. Here's to more such happy walks and vents 🥂.

Basic expenses: 

🏍️Petrol: Ranging from ₹200 to ₹400 depending on the distance, to and fro. I take public transport if it's beyond 15km radius as I don't do long city rides.

🍿☕Water/Snacks: This is something that I wish to offer from my end 99% of the time, unless the person whom I walk offers to pay. It ranges between ₹50 to ₹200.

Stickers/Cards: I use Vista Print to print cards to give away to random people and also to my dear co-walkers. (Image attached for reference)

Link to Buy me a Coffee: buymeacoffee.com/walktaxi

That's it. :) Thanks for reading till this.

To book a walk, you can head over to my Instagram page: www.instagram.com/walktaxi/ and DM to book a walk. No slots concept. So it just works intuitively through discussion.

Much Love,
Krishna (Walk Taxi)",27,1739941017.0,chennaicity,7,1.0,False

1isxgo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1isxgo2/kubevpn_revolutionizing_kubernetes_local/,KubeVPN: Revolutionizing Kubernetes Local Development,"## Why KubeVPN?

In the Kubernetes era, developers face a critical conflict between **cloud-native complexity** and **local development
agility**. Traditional workflows force developers to:

1. Suffer frequent `kubectl port-forward`/`exec` operations
2. Set up mini Kubernetes clusters locally (e.g., minikube)
3. Risk disrupting shared dev environments

KubeVPN solves this through **cloud-native network tunneling**, seamlessly extending Kubernetes cluster networks to
local machines with three breakthroughs:

- 🚀 **Zero-Code Integration**: Access cluster services without code changes
- 💻 **Real-Environment Debugging**: Debug cloud services in local IDEs
- 🔄 **Bidirectional Traffic Control**: Route specific traffic to local or cloud

![KubeVPN Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubenetworks/kubevpn/master/samples/flat_log.png)

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Direct Cluster Networking

```bash
kubevpn connect
```

Instantly gain:

- ✅ Service name access (e.g., `productpage.default.svc`)
- ✅ Pod IP connectivity
- ✅ Native Kubernetes DNS resolution

```shell
➜ curl productpage:9080 # Direct cluster access
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>...</html>
```

### 2. Smart Traffic Interception

Precision routing via header conditions:

```bash
kubevpn proxy deployment/productpage --headers user=dev-team
```

- Requests with `user=dev-team` → Local service
- Others → Original cluster handling

### 3. Multi-Cluster Mastery

Connect two clusters simultaneously:

```bash
kubevpn connect -n dev --kubeconfig ~/.kube/cluster1  # Primary
kubevpn connect -n prod --kubeconfig ~/.kube/cluster2 --lite # Secondary
```

### 4. Local Containerized Dev

Clone cloud pods to local Docker:

```bash
kubevpn dev deployment/authors --entrypoint sh
```

Launched containers feature:

- 🌐 Identical network namespace
- 📁 Exact volume mounts
- ⚙️ Matching environment variables

## Technical Deep Dive

| KubeVPN Proxy | 33ms    | 15%       | 300MB  |
| Telepresence  | 41ms    | 22%       | 420MB  |

KubeVPN outperforms alternatives in overhead control.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# macOS/Linux
brew install kubevpn

# Windows
scoop install kubevpn

# Via Krew
kubectl krew install kubevpn/kubevpn
```

### Sample Workflow

1. **Connect Cluster**

```bash
kubevpn connect --namespace dev
```

2. **Develop & Debug**

```bash
# Start local service
./my-service &

# Intercept debug traffic

Is caffeine ever hit or miss for anybody? Sometimes it makes it so I am tired right away and just crash. (I drank a celsius and two cups of coffee and took a 6 hour nap) But sometimes it'll work short term and wire me with focus for a few hours then I am exhausted. I guess the end result is that I always crash. But it seems sometimes the caffeine ""works"" and other times it just triggers the crash immediately. I sleep typically 9-11 hours, so I am not really tired beforehand. ",13,1739940985.0,ADHD,16,0.88,False

1isxetw,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1isxetw/im_25_and_still_cant_drive_and_this_has_made_it/,"I'm 25 and still can't drive, and this has made it extremely difficult to find a job I can even apply to to pay for driver's ed. Is there any (non-expensive) way to get behind-the-wheel experience besides from my blood parents?","For clarity, at roughly this time last year, I managed to get my hand on a used bicycle, which I then taught myself to ride in an effort to be able to reach anyplace outside the suburban neighborhood we were moved to a few years back. So far, the only two places I can reliably get to without stinking to high heaven (and that aren't just more houses) are a coffee shop and a gas station. Neither of them are hiring, but I *have* been almost run off the road by aggressive drivers and lost all sensation in one knee after a particularly bad wipeout. Combine that with the fact that we live in a climate that regularly gets snow in the winter and I have no money to buy snow tires for my bike, and while my bike is my pride and joy, I can't rely on it being my daily driver. Not for a *while* yet, at least.

Segue, my parents have spent the past ten years bemoaning how I can't drive and complaining that I seem to have no interest in learning. I know this because those are their usual responses whenever I ask them to teach me like they promised to ten years ago. On rare occasions, we actually manage to hash out a date for them to actually get me to a parking lot to practice, but 99% of those dates go by with them being busy doing other things instead, and the remaining 1% consists of them talking *at* me in the car for 45-50 minutes straight of basic things I already know, then 10-15 minutes of meandering through the lot, and then cutting me off as I finally get the swing of things to tell me we have to go back home.

I can't *do* this anymore.

A driving instructor (and a ride to and from one) would cost money that I don't have, and if I ask my parents to pay for it, they'll *lose* it because *they* wanted to be the ones to teach me to drive. I *have* IRL friends who can drive, but I haven't seen them in months and I'm worried that I'd be imposing too much if I ask *them* to take me to and from a driving instructor. It'd *definitely* be imposing too much to ask to drive *their* cars around, I'm pretty sure.

The only course of action I can find is trying to make something that I can sell online in secret, building up a stash of money my parents don't know about (so they don't demand it as rent before I can find a driving instructor), and paying my way through a driver's ed course. I at least have a learner's permit, so I'm good on the written knowledge. It's just actual lived experience that I'm lacking.

Is there anything obvious I'm missing that could make this whole mess easier? Are there driving instructors who offer discounts on family coming in to learn together (as my 22yo brother is in the exact same boat I am)? Is this *actually* messed up or am I just making mountains out of molehills?",1,1739940820.0,internetparents,12,0.67,False

1isxcz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1isxcz3/2_month_check_in/,2 month check in!,"So, today marks 60 days off of caffeine. I can't say I'm living my best life and quitting caffeine was everything I dreamed it would be - but I can say, I've made steady progress. Day to day it doesn't feel like I'm growing and healing, however when I look back to where I was on day 30 vs where I am now, there has been a huge jump.

The biggest life improvement I have experienced so far, has been being prepared for spontaneous plans or social gatherings and stuff like that. I used to time my caffeine use around socialising. If I had a date or was hanging with friends I would want to have coffee right before, or I would cancel or reject people. If I had too much caffeine and slept poorly or was too anxious, it was incredibly common for me to just cancel plans. And then when trying to quit, I wouldn't make plans through the first week of withdrawals - but then I would relapse and thus would reset my isolation period. Not anymore though. When my friends ask me to make plans on the fly, I don't have to think twice I just say yeah. Same deal with dates. 

  
Another life improvement, and life deterioration at the same time - has been that I am far more conscious and emotional now. It's great in the sense that I feel more human, I can connect and relate to other people more, and I can actually weigh out decisions with emotions and my subconscious desires involved - rather than just being logical and robotic. But on the other hand, I am actually really struggling to stay afloat and handle negative emotions and a higher level of consciousness. When I think about mortality or existence I overwhelm myself now. (I used to be so indifferent to why we're here, how I want to spend my life, my own mortality, etc). Also, if I have a bad day or wake up in a poor mood, I have no crutch. I just have to suffer. As a result, I have extreme days on either side of the spectrum. Some days are awesome, whereas some days are so heavy and so debilitating I don't even want to exist.

Another pro I've experienced is impulse control. I am doing no alcohol this year, and I have tried to quit alcohol probably 10 times in the past and failed. But this time feels far easier. When I feel like drinking, while the impulse is there, I can pull from my higher reasoning brain and weigh out my decision. This has been really massive. 

  
My short term memory has also seen a major improvement, however this is not carrying over into my long term memory (which sucks). I could tell you everything I did or learnt or saw yesterday, however if you asked what I did in the last week or month I'd go blank.

  
Another thing I'm experiencing which has been a huge struggle, is whenever I exercise in the evening I have the worst sleep ever. I practise jujitsu and my gym only offers evening classes. When I put my head down to sleep at say, 11pm - my body is way too hot, my mind is wide awake, I have too much energy etc. Somedays I can't sleep until 3 or 4am if I train the night prior. I'm also requiring 9-10 hours of sleep per night to feel good/alert during the day. So those two contradictions are exhausting me.

I had the worst cravings ever in the first half of this month, however my brain is for sure recalibrating as now my cravings are fleeting and short lived. If I go out with friends or something, my attitude about coffee has changed as well. When people used to ask if I wanted a coffee, I'd say how great it was and how much I love it but say I can't sleep after it so I'll skip this time around. Nowadays, I don't need the spiel, I just say ""I don't drink coffee"". So far this hasn't resulted in further questioning. In my mind I thought not drinking coffee would be judged similarly as to not drinking alcohol but this has not been the case at all.

  
Another weird and unexpected symptom is that I have really wet lips now... And my mouth almost feels like it's overproducing sliver? Super strange, hoping this will regulate in the next month as well. I also feel like my hydration levels are off - I drink lots of water, but sometimes I feel excessively thirsty. It's like my bodies impulses for water are not aligned with when it actually needs water?? (I'm not dehydrated, I usually have clear pee).

  
I have to say I was expecting more in terms of my skin appearance. I have seen minor improvements, but overall I would say my skin at large looks like it did when I was drinking coffee. 

  
ALSO! I don't know how I forgot to mention this earlier on in this post, but I have picked up two new hobbies, both learning a language and learning an instrument in the last month. And I've been really consistent. In the past I used to start a hobby, try to dedicate 2+ hours to said hobby a day, and I'd burn out within a week. This time around i'm just doing 10-30 minutes a day but trying to make time for my hobbies each day. I don't feel burnt out at all and it feels really sustainable.

  
Overall, I've seen really great growth in the last month, but despite that, I can't help but think this is it. That I will see no further growth from here. I'm not happy where I am currently, so the thought that this might be it scares me. I'm sticking to my golden rule though - no caffeine for 1 year. The toughest part for me has been the existential thoughts. Last month they gave me anxiety attacks, and while this month they're not quite as heavy - they are still constantly looming and taunting me. I don't remember the last day I went without thinking about existence or mortality. However the benefits listed above and hopefully more in the coming months give me hope and something to cling on to despite life being a bit rough at the moment. I'll be back for a month 3 check in, hopefully with more good news. Stay strong everybody!",7,1739940651.0,decaf,2,0.9,False

* - not their real name

I’m 35, born and raised in the USA, and of Afghan descent. Ten months ago, I married Ali*, who is 33. Our story felt like something out of a fairytale—we met during Umrah, and there was an instant connection. He was charming, confident, and had this quiet intensity that drew me in. Before I knew it, I had left everything behind and moved to the Middle East to be with him. I fell hard, convinced I had finally found the love I had been waiting for.

What set him apart from all the men I had met before—the ones from dating apps, the awkward coffee meetups, the never-ending matchmaking events—was that he didn’t ask the typical, shallow questions. He seemed different. Genuine. Understanding. I thought I had finally met someone who saw me for who I was.

When I opened up about my past—about being a survivor of SA, about my struggles, my mistakes—he didn’t react with judgment or disgust like I had feared. Instead, he told me to stop confessing my sins to him and to seek forgiveness from Allah. He wasn’t my judge, he said—he just wanted to be with the person I was now and grow with me. His words felt like a balm to old wounds. For the first time, I felt safe. Seen. Understood.

He promised me in front of the Kabba he would a caring husband, loyal, and honest. He confessed how he is going through a tough spot financially and to stand by him.
I didn’t ask for mehr and agreed to do the wedding once he came to America. 

We married in a simple nikah ceremony, and for a while, I thought I had finally found peace. My mother and brother flew in for the occasion, and three months later, we had our civil marriage in the UAE. I knew I was marrying a single father, and I tried to be supportive as he navigated his custody issues.

But there was something else—someone else—lurking in the shadows of our relationship.

Before me, there had been another woman. I’ll call her “Miss Dubai.”  They were engaged after his divorce and obviously before I had met him. Their relationship had been fast, intense. They met while working together in Riyadh. She secured him a visa to the UAE to meet her family—an impossible feat for an Afghan passport holder. She got him a job at her brother’s luxury hotel. She was ready to marry him, and he had already signed a lease for the apartment they were supposed to share.

Then, just a week before their nikah, she asked for one thing: to speak to his parents. Ali had no contact with them—they had stolen his life savings and abandoned him before moving to Turkey. He reluctantly allowed them to talk. To this day, he doesn’t know what his mother told her, but whatever it was, it was enough. She packed up all his gifts, returned the ring, and walked away without another word.

And now, on the morning of my civil marriage to him, Ali told me he had dreamed about her the night before. I was understanding as we were in the city where he knew her and we can't control our dreams. 

“She was such a good girl,” he said, his voice filled with something I had never heard when he spoke about me. “She did so much for me. She helped me get my visa, something I never could’ve done on my own. I’ll never forget how much she and her family did for me. She even got me a job at her brother’s hotel. Who does that for a stranger?”

I sat there in the hotel, organizing our marriage license and immigration papers for the USA, building our future—while he reminisced about the woman who had left him behind. I didn't just cry, I was flat out bawling. Is this really happening a couple of hours after signing our marriage license? 

He dismissed my feelings, blaming me for prying, even though he had brought her up. “If I can’t talk to my wife about what I’m feeling, who else can I speak to?” he asked, as if my hurt was an inconvenience. I was so emotionally exhausted that I asked him to drop it and to not bring it up again.

I tried to be patient, to understand him. He had lived alone for so long, and I excused so much of his behavior because of it. But it only got worse. At dinner, he would watch entire movies on his phone, barely acknowledging my presence or talking to me. I would wait at home, desperate for some connection, while he preferred his solitude—even after being out all day for work. I was alone in a foreign country with no support system, no friends, no one to turn to. He also didn’t change any of his solo habits in the beginning of our marriage.

I would get ready for dates and he wouldn’t look up from his phone or compliment me when I spent an hour getting ready. His excuse? He doesn’t want to give me “nazar” by complimenting me. 

One night, I waited all day for him for our date with my new abaya. He said we’ll leave in an hour and watched an entire movie (one he previously watched) knowing we had plans. It was hours later before he realized I wasn’t sitting with him in the living room. I wiped off my makeup, wore my pajamas, and went to bed feeling forgotten. It was one of our worst fights but I kept telling myself the first year is the worst and it takes time to figure each other out. 

I already married so late in life, I have to make this work. 

When we would do Umrah together, we would drive from Riyadh to Madina/Makkah which ranges 7-9 hours. (I wonder if anyone remembers this post) He would refuse to get a hotel and would park at a McDonald’s parking lot or gas station, pull the seat back, and sleep for a couple of hours before he continued to drive. I would be sitting in the car waiting for my husband to wake up. I would try to shake him, gently wake him up, and he would get angry and go back to sleep.

“Do you want me to crash? I’m tired let me sleep. We don’t need a hotel.” 

I told him I don’t feel comfortable with this and am not used to it and I’ll pay for a cheap hotel on my own credit card. The only reason he doesn’t do this anymore is he moved closer - now we’re an hour from Makkah and 3/4 hours from Madina. But I still remember those parking lot breaks where I would be wide awake in the seat while he slept.

This is stupid but another thing he did was he never offered me food. If we were to eat together, I would give him the first bite or half my plate. He would scarf his food down before he offered. This habit changed later down the road and I figure because we were raised in different countries. I just remember how off putting this was.

My visa expired after 90 days so sometimes if I was homesick, I would fly back home. When I was back in America, I would panic about coming back sooner since my husband stopped being in touch despite me begging him to stay in touch when I was gone. He’s someone who’s glued to his phone so I don’t excuse him for not being able to call or text me. I tell him even if it’s to say “I’m busy at work.” We didn’t have to have full emotional talks everyday. 

We would grow apart when I wasn’t physically next to him being in the company of his misery. If I was out of sight, I was out of mind. I would return back quickly as I didn’t want to compromise the marriage since he wasn’t communicating with me, I would be a gone a month and he never had a desire to call me or hear my voice. It was me calling, reaching out, and updating him.

Misery truly loves company.

We also tried for a baby because of my age and we were unable to get pregnant. I was pricked and poked. Bloodwork, scans, and a fertility consultation later, I was actually very fertile. I was happy to hear. I had great egg quality and more than enough. He never brought up his health until the doctor confirmed I was the problem.

“You know, it took my ex wife and I a long time to have my daughter.” I was racking myself thinking I was the issue and he decides to share this after all of my tests. I demanded he test his “specimen.”

He was at 0% motility - 0% motility means that the specimen is unable to move at all, which can make it difficult for fertilization to occur. I had to wait for it to improve to try medical intervention such as IVF or ICSI. 

I never shamed him for it but I know deep down if the tables were turned and I was the issue, he would make sure to remind me everyday. I do resent him for never telling me his prior struggles.

The emotional neglect was suffocating. I felt like I was disappearing, like I was screaming into the void, hoping he would hear me. But he never did.

The more I tried to hold on to him, the more I lost myself in the process. I looked awful. I put on weight, I was losing my hair, and my spark was gone. 

Everyday was a fight despite how much I changed. I stopped defending myself, stopped complaining about being alone, would deep clean the house daily despite what a mess he would leave, cooked every meal when I never cooked before, or ask for anything other than necessities. Shampoo was fine but conditioner? 

“Do you really need conditioner?” He’d bring it home. Face wash? “Didn’t you just have face wash?”

Lipstick? Makeup? Blow dryer? I didn’t have a job but I went and got it myself. I kept trying to make myself look nice so he would treat me better. I consider myself conventionally attractive but I felt so ugly at home.

He was tight on money and reminded me everyday. “If only my business from 3 years ago was still going on, id be so well off I’d buy you everything and we’d travel. Please just be patient.” He loved to reminisce about this stupid business I was sick of hearing about. It was in the past but he won’t let it go.

Now he works for a delivery company: it’s like hunger station or DoorDash. He works 10 hours a day, 6 days a week. When he comes home, fair enough he’s exhausted. He sleeps in the living room watching tv and I sleep alone in our bedroom.

We eat dinner when he comes and if I try to hold his hand or cuddle he brushes me
Off and says “stop.” I feel rejected then excuse myself. He doesn’t come after me or check on me after at about 4/5 times. 

In front of my family, he’s so romantic. Bragging about bringing my favorite coffee every day (which he does), taking care of me, holding my hand, kissing my forehead, and bragging about how lucky he is. It feel so fake since I know he isn’t like this at home. 

His paperwork is currently processing. I submitted all of our things and he paid for the lawyer who did all of the paperwork. With him not being home and me being severely neglected and lonely, I asked to go back to the U.S. I wanted to go back to work since I couldn’t find work in Jeddah and start saving for his arrival. In reality, I was just homesick but that was my excuse. He also complained that the expenses of the house was getting expensive and I know he meant me despite how much I cut back.

I bought my ticket and arrived to the U.S 20 days ago and I felt such a relief. I also don’t miss my husband at all which is a strange feeling. 

He called me worried about expenses again and I bluntly told him since I wasn’t there, he couldn’t blame me and figure out where the excess spending is coming from.

He brought up possibly moving to the UAE since there’s no taxes there or Kafeels/sponsors and he would be able to keep his income. In the past, we discussed it but decided to not move forward. I would’ve paid for an apartment in Sharjah for 6 months so he could find work. I found one for about 1900 USD. 

He brought it up again and I told him it was a dumb idea and I’m not going to do it. 

I broke down to my mother last night about how unhappy I was and I was mean-
I’ll admit. I flat out said this guy could care less if I’m home or not, doesn’t give me an allowance, doesn’t appreciate me, can’t give me a baby, and is still asking me to change and be patient. 

I said it to my mom since I can’t say it to him despite how much my dislike is turning to hate work him. 

She was supportive about whatever decision I want to do. He must felt a change in me because he’s suddenly calling and texting me everyday: it’s out of character.

I told him flat out I don’t think I’ll be coming back and he’s not sure what I mean by this. He isn’t taking his fertility health seriously either, not reaching out, and literally didn’t fight for me to stay back with him. He thought he would save money when I left home. He encouraged me to find work not for my loneliness but to come back k with some money to help out,

Sometimes I wonder if I’m being punished because I became a better Muslim much later in life. 

His paperwork is processing so time is ticking. 

Is the first year this tough and I need to toughen up or am I being treated unfairly? ",2,1739940187.0,MuslimNikah,4,0.75,False

Here is my favorite at-home iced latte recipe: Save and wash an old marinara, salsa, or pickle jar, something made of glass with a lid. In the jar, pour a little sweetened condensed milk (it tastes like white mocha but cheaper) with a few drops of almond extract and a dash of cinnamon. Brew your espresso and mix with the sweetened condensed milk. Fill with ice, put the lid on, and shake. Fill the jar to your liking with milk, add a straw, and there you have a fantastic iced latte costing a few cents in ingredients and maybe 5 minutes of your morning. You can perfect your own with different sweeteners, sugars, and milks to make something better than any drive-through coffee shop for a few cents per day.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Want to come over for a drink? Not really, an online drink I suppose. Maybe we can talk about the above stuff. Some things I didn’t mention. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

I didn’t ask for mehr and agreed to do the wedding once he came to America. 

We married in a simple nikah ceremony, and for a while, I thought I had finally found peace. My mother and brother flew in for the occasion, and three months later, we had our civil marriage in the UAE. I knew I was marrying a single father, and I tried to be supportive as he navigated his custody issues.

But there was something else—someone else—lurking in the shadows of our relationship.

Before me, there had been another woman. I’ll call her “Miss Dubai.”  They were engaged after his divorce and obviously before I had met him. Their relationship had been fast, intense. They met while working together in Riyadh. She secured him a visa to the UAE to meet her family—an impossible feat for an Afghan passport holder. She got him a job at her brother’s luxury hotel. She was ready to marry him, and he had already signed a lease for the apartment they were supposed to share.

Then, just a week before their nikah, she asked for one thing: to speak to his parents. Ali had no contact with them—they had stolen his life savings and abandoned him before moving to Turkey. He reluctantly allowed them to talk. To this day, he doesn’t know what his mother told her, but whatever it was, it was enough. She packed up all his gifts, returned the ring, and walked away without another word.

And now, on the morning of my civil marriage to him, Ali told me he had dreamed about her the night before. I was understanding as we were in the city where he knew her and we can't control our dreams. 

“She was such a good girl,” he said, his voice filled with something I had never heard when he spoke about me. “She did so much for me. She helped me get my visa, something I never could’ve done on my own. I’ll never forget how much she and her family did for me. She even got me a job at her brother’s hotel. Who does that for a stranger?”

I sat there in the hotel, organizing our marriage license and immigration papers for the USA, building our future—while he reminisced about the woman who had left him behind. I didn't just cry, I was flat out bawling. Is this really happening a couple of hours after signing our marriage license? 

He dismissed my feelings, blaming me for prying, even though he had brought her up. “If I can’t talk to my wife about what I’m feeling, who else can I speak to?” he asked, as if my hurt was an inconvenience. I was so emotionally exhausted that I asked him to drop it and to not bring it up again.

I tried to be patient, to understand him. He had lived alone for so long, and I excused so much of his behavior because of it. But it only got worse. At dinner, he would watch entire movies on his phone, barely acknowledging my presence or talking to me. I would wait at home, desperate for some connection, while he preferred his solitude—even after being out all day for work. I was alone in a foreign country with no support system, no friends, no one to turn to. He also didn’t change any of his solo habits in the beginning of our marriage.

I would get ready for dates and he wouldn’t look up from his phone or compliment me when I spent an hour getting ready. His excuse? He doesn’t want to give me “nazar” by complimenting me. 

One night, I waited all day for him for our date with my new abaya. He said we’ll leave in an hour and watched an entire movie (one he previously watched) knowing we had plans. It was hours later before he realized I wasn’t sitting with him in the living room. I wiped off my makeup, wore my pajamas, and went to bed feeling forgotten. It was one of our worst fights but I kept telling myself the first year is the worst and it takes time to figure each other out. 

I already married so late in life, I have to make this work. 

When we would do Umrah together, we would drive from Riyadh to Madina/Makkah which ranges 7-9 hours. (I wonder if anyone remembers this post) He would refuse to get a hotel and would park at a McDonald’s parking lot or gas station, pull the seat back, and sleep for a couple of hours before he continued to drive. I would be sitting in the car waiting for my husband to wake up. I would try to shake him, gently wake him up, and he would get angry and go back to sleep.

“Do you want me to crash? I’m tired let me sleep. We don’t need a hotel.” 

I told him I don’t feel comfortable with this and am not used to it and I’ll pay for a cheap hotel on my own credit card. The only reason he doesn’t do this anymore is he moved closer - now we’re an hour from Makkah and 3/4 hours from Madina. But I still remember those parking lot breaks where I would be wide awake in the seat while he slept.

This is stupid but another thing he did was he never offered me food. If we were to eat together, I would give him the first bite or half my plate. He would scarf his food down before he offered. This habit changed later down the road and I figure because we were raised in different countries. I just remember how off putting this was.

My visa expired after 90 days so sometimes if I was homesick, I would fly back home. When I was back in America, I would panic about coming back sooner since my husband stopped being in touch despite me begging him to stay in touch when I was gone. He’s someone who’s glued to his phone so I don’t excuse him for not being able to call or text me. I tell him even if it’s to say “I’m busy at work.” We didn’t have to have full emotional talks everyday. 

We would grow apart when I wasn’t physically next to him being in the company of his misery. If I was out of sight, I was out of mind. I would return back quickly as I didn’t want to compromise the marriage since he wasn’t communicating with me, I would be a gone a month and he never had a desire to call me or hear my voice. It was me calling, reaching out, and updating him.

Misery truly loves company.

We also tried for a baby because of my age and we were unable to get pregnant. I was pricked and poked. Bloodwork, scans, and a fertility consultation later, I was actually very fertile. I was happy to hear. I had great egg quality and more than enough. He never brought up his health until the doctor confirmed I was the problem.

“You know, it took my ex wife and I a long time to have my daughter.” I was racking myself thinking I was the issue and he decides to share this after all of my tests. I demanded he test his “specimen.”

He was at 0% motility - 0% motility means that the specimen is unable to move at all, which can make it difficult for fertilization to occur. I had to wait for it to improve to try medical intervention such as IVF or ICSI. 

I never shamed him for it but I know deep down if the tables were turned and I was the issue, he would make sure to remind me everyday. I do resent him for never telling me his prior struggles.

The emotional neglect was suffocating. I felt like I was disappearing, like I was screaming into the void, hoping he would hear me. But he never did.

The more I tried to hold on to him, the more I lost myself in the process. I looked awful. I put on weight, I was losing my hair, and my spark was gone. 

Everyday was a fight despite how much I changed. I stopped defending myself, stopped complaining about being alone, would deep clean the house daily despite what a mess he would leave, cooked every meal when I never cooked before, or ask for anything other than necessities. Shampoo was fine but conditioner? 

“Do you really need conditioner?” He’d bring it home. Face wash? “Didn’t you just have face wash?”

Lipstick? Makeup? Blow dryer? I didn’t have a job but I went and got it myself. I kept trying to make myself look nice so he would treat me better. I consider myself conventionally attractive but I felt so ugly at home.

He was tight on money and reminded me everyday. “If only my business from 3 years ago was still going on, id be so well off I’d buy you everything and we’d travel. Please just be patient.” He loved to reminisce about this stupid business I was sick of hearing about. It was in the past but he won’t let it go.

Now he works for a delivery company: it’s like hunger station or DoorDash. He works 10 hours a day, 6 days a week. When he comes home, fair enough he’s exhausted. He sleeps in the living room watching tv and I sleep alone in our bedroom.

We eat dinner when he comes and if I try to hold his hand or cuddle he brushes me
Off and says “stop.” I feel rejected then excuse myself. He doesn’t come after me or check on me after at about 4/5 times. 

In front of my family, he’s so romantic. Bragging about bringing my favorite coffee every day (which he does), taking care of me, holding my hand, kissing my forehead, and bragging about how lucky he is. It feel so fake since I know he isn’t like this at home. 

His paperwork is currently processing. I submitted all of our things and he paid for the lawyer who did all of the paperwork. With him not being home and me being severely neglected and lonely, I asked to go back to the U.S. I wanted to go back to work since I couldn’t find work in Jeddah and start saving for his arrival. In reality, I was just homesick but that was my excuse. He also complained that the expenses of the house was getting expensive and I know he meant me despite how much I cut back.

I bought my ticket and arrived to the U.S 20 days ago and I felt such a relief. I also don’t miss my husband at all which is a strange feeling. 

He called me worried about expenses again and I bluntly told him since I wasn’t there, he couldn’t blame me and figure out where the excess spending is coming from.

He brought up possibly moving to the UAE since there’s no taxes there or Kafeels/sponsors and he would be able to keep his income. In the past, we discussed it but decided to not move forward. I would’ve paid for an apartment in Sharjah for 6 months so he could find work. I found one for about 1900 USD. 

He brought it up again and I told him it was a dumb idea and I’m not going to do it. 

I broke down to my mother last night about how unhappy I was and I was mean-
I’ll admit. I flat out said this guy could care less if I’m home or not, doesn’t give me an allowance, doesn’t appreciate me, can’t give me a baby, and is still asking me to change and be patient. 

I said it to my mom since I can’t say it to him despite how much my dislike is turning to hate work him. 

She was supportive about whatever decision I want to do. He must felt a change in me because he’s suddenly calling and texting me everyday: it’s out of character.

I told him flat out I don’t think I’ll be coming back and he’s not sure what I mean by this. He isn’t taking his fertility health seriously either, not reaching out, and literally didn’t fight for me to stay back with him. He thought he would save money when I left home. He encouraged me to find work not for my loneliness but to come back k with some money to help out,

Sometimes I wonder if I’m being punished because I became a better Muslim much later in life. 

His paperwork is processing so time is ticking.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Who are you, actually. How do you understand life and yourself. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

Is how i'm feeling now normal or ""too much""?","I (25 M), went on a date with a girl, (24 F) who we will call Kayla. I will provide background context relevant followed by details of the date, and will explain the emotions I am feeling to my best ability. A lot of the emotions I feel now are very new in the context of being after a first date. I ask for respectful and serious responses only, and other perspectives with some elaboration behind them.

  
For some background context, I was previously acquainted with Kayla as she was old coworkers and friends with my cousin who I used to live with. I had met her a couple of times, and then she was actually a bridesmaid at my cousins wedding last July which I was an Usher in. I was crushing on her then but kept that subtle, though ended up dancing with and shotgunning a beer with her at the reception. I did catch a vibe that she was into me, and wanted to hit her up afterwards, but my dumbass decided to go sleep with the one other single girl who made what she wanted more apparant later that night. Kayla who lived nearby couldn't stay too late and had to get home to tend to her dog that night. I figured my shot with Kayla was gone and that everyone would find out as girls talk even though the girl I slept with flew in from out of state and didn't really know anyone else there besides my cousin. But I figured my shot with Kayla was done for after that, though she's like a societal 9/10 (10/10 to me) while i'm a like 6 or 7 /10 at most, wasn't sure i'd have much of a shot anyways (not that looks always matter that much anyways but still play a role in perception).

Zooming forward to now, a little over a week ago, I matched with Kayla on Tinder. I was skeptical of anything coming of it as I thought maybe she only swiped because she knew me. After matching I was hesitant to message her, but kept it casual from the beginning, expanded the conversation which went really well, and got the guts to ask to get to know her more over margaritas. We talked over the course of the last week and had decent conversations, though not much flirting or anything up to the point of the date, though it was fairly implied that it was a date. She did also express excitement prior to the date, as I reflected back. I was very excited for the date but made sure I didn't attach to that excitement too much and kept myself open to talking and seeing other people, which I went on one date prior with someone who I had decent conversation with at the most, though just wasn't super into them.

To the point, yesterday was the date, and I didn't hold too much onto the nervousness, except for figuring out what the hell to wear. We met at the lobby of the restaurant where she greeted me with a hug and we went to our seats. She was stunning, which may have played a role in my slight nervousness, though I didn't really express that much at all. After some amazing conversation, some flirting (on both ends), 2 margaritas each, a touch of competitiveness, and some food, she invited me to get drinks with and to introduce me to a couple of her best friends at a nearby bar/restaurant that she worked at as long as I was comfortable doing so (which I was). At this point i'm mezmorized by this girl. Not only was she gorgeous, she was very intelligent, emotionally intelligent, willing to be very open about her feelings, mature, authentic, and forward which are all things I value a lot and don't tend to find a lot of with dating.

We went to the bar and I met her friends, got to see how she interacts with her friends, had some physical touch (my arm around her that she leaned into), and honestly felt like I was a part of their group. I was getting along with one of her friends/coworkers very well who was talking me up to her after I sat and talked to him a bit while the girls went to the bathroom (swear they set this up XD). Apparantly he's not approved of guys like that in the past (maybe a good sign? Or a sign that i'm not her type and gonna get friendzoned). I had a beer at this place and decided to stop drinking so I could drive because we were going to different towns bars. Did a little bar hopping and I had a single beer at the last bar in her town, and prior to that she was like ""so you're staying at my house"" and I was all for it, as we had continued to connect more during the night while increasingly flirting. I went back to her house with her and while in the middle of talking about something after parking she leans in and we start making out. I had no expectations of anything but she was getting very turned on and I mentioned we should go inside and she said ""yes, also we can't have sex because i'm on my period but we can do anything else as in I can do stuff for you."" I was shocked (in a good way). We went inside, I met her very large dog who was nervous at first but warmed up quick, and we eventually got to bed where we starting kissing and long story short, got a towel and had sex. We had amazing sexual compatability and ended up cuddling and going to bed afterwards. A lot of intimacy that night with the kisses and cudding and connection that we communicated mutually to eachother. It actually felt like a movie, but was all so real. The next morning we cuddled a little and grabbed coffee at a local shop after she got ready for work. I brought her to her car and we kissed and agreed that we had a lot of fun and both wanna see eachother again.

Well here I am today writing a novel about it, as I cannot get her or that date off of my mind. I feel so positive, hopeful, and excited. Though with those feelings, I feel a little anxious, nervous, and fearful. She had mentioned that she's gone through some stuff with prior relationships with being cheated on, lied to, hurt, betrayed, and told some nasty things. My thoughts are clearly she's in or recovering from a vunerable or hurt place although she seems like she has a really good grasp on her emotions. I'm worried she's not able to actually develop a real connection with the place she might be in, and is solely focused on just having fun. I feel slightly conflicted because she has expressed a lot of real emotions and positive feelings towards me, even though she's brought up that she's going through some stuff in regards to what she's looking for (in the beginning when I asked her on a date). I am aware that none of you are her (I hope), and can't speculate on whats going through her head. I had some texts with her during the day today and she seems very into me still with lots of smiley faces and showing interest, though I feel as if I want to address to her more so on how I feel and ask her more about where she's at in the sense of connection. I asked her if she'd be down to call after shes off work and she said she'd love to with a smiley face. We haven't talked on the phone at all yet so that was nice to hear. I'm hesitant on whether I should bring up any of the stuff I want to in fear of it being way too early to go so deep after just one date. I genuinely don't want to scare her away but also want to protect my emotions if she's in a different place.

Is it generally innappropriate to have such conversation so early in meeting and connecting with someone? I want to tell her that hey you impressed the hell out of me and left a super good impression on me on our date. I want to let her know that even after having been on many dates, that i've never felt this way after just one date. And I wan't to let her know that she's been lingering on my mind, and that I feel really good about her. I also want to bring up that with that, asking where she stands as far as being able to build a connection considering some of the barriers of having issues with trusting and anxiety. In my head, maybe she does feel different about me, or maybe bringing up so much so quick will instantly drive her away. Maybe those barriers are still very much there but she's willing to talk about them and navigate them with me. She's typically been way more open to me about the way she feels towards me than I have with her, though I am so conflicted on whether I should take the leap yet or be perhaps a bit more patient before having these conversations.

Side note: I'm not trying to be in a relationship with her immediately or move through anything too fast by any means. I just want to be very transparent with my feelings and want to know more about where she's at more so in general as far as her willingness to allow her to build a connection.

  
If you were in her shoes, would this scream at you to turn the other way? Or do you feel you'd appreciate this level of communication? I know everyone is different, but if many of you say ""slow down son, that's way too much"" opposed to ""It's situational and how she responds doesn't matter, it'll just show if she accepts you for you or not"" then i'll be able to act a bit more appropriately. Are these feelings normal after just one date like this or am I just putting way too much energy into it? I know that this is so situational, but for the protection of myself am considering bringing it up, even though I know that patience and waiting is most likely the safer route.

Air plants, known scientifically as Tillandsia, are unique epiphytes that thrive without soil, making them a favorite among plant enthusiasts. Their care is straightforward, ensuring that even novice gardeners can enjoy these captivating plants. Adequate light, watering techniques, and proper display methods are essential for keeping air plants healthy and vibrant.

For optimal air plants care, provide bright, indirect light. An east or west-facing window is ideal, but avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch the leaves. Regular air circulation is crucial as well, as it helps prevent mold and decay. Aim to mist your air plants 2-3 times a week, or soak them in water for about 20-30 minutes every couple of weeks, depending on humidity levels in your area.

When it comes to displaying air plants, creativity is key. Here are some unique and easy display ideas:

- **Wall-mounted holders:** Utilize wall-mounted holders or magnetic planters to create an eye-catching vertical garden.
- **Terrariums:** Place air plants in glass terrariums with decorative stones or seashells for a chic and modern touch.
- **Hanging displays:** Suspend air plants in the air using fishing line or twine for a whimsical floating effect.
- **Creative containers:** Use repurposed items such as coffee mugs or small wooden boxes as unique plant holders.

The appeal of air plants lies in their versatility. With minimal care and endless display options, they can complement any décor style, from rustic to contemporary. Whether grouping several plants together or opting for a single statement piece, air plants can transform spaces with their lush greenery. Discover the joy of air plants care and display, making your indoor environment more vibrant and alive.

1isx0p1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1isx0p1/whatever_came_out_of_our_hospitals_abandoned/,Whatever came out of our hospital's abandoned pediatric wing should have stayed there.,"I guess I should clarify a few things. I work in the OR with my mom at a small catholic owned hospital in Utah. We've been bought out by several companies several times, and every single time we are bought out, the company who buys our hospital goes bankrupt. The first few times it was kind of funny. After our last company though, we've gotten tired of all the lawsuit junk mail showing up for different lawyers trying to get us ""the money we deserved."" Whatever. I'm still paid hourly, and so is everyone else. They can take it up with the Docs, God knows they were pissed.

That's not necessarily the weirdest part about my job. I guess putting the pieces together, it might correlate with what's been happening in Peds. It's like a cursed hospital- temporarily tamed by the catholic organization which it belongs to. Regardless, I've always loved my job. I'm a CNA, or an ""Orderly,"" cleaning and moving beds around, filling up fluid warmers, taking out garbage and sharps and instrument pans, turning over rooms- I'm the OR ""everything"" person.

This all started when we got the stupid ""O Arm"" x-ray device. Radiology couldn't hold onto it because it was so massive, and our managers told us that we couldn't move it around otherwise we could break it. The damn thing cost 1.3 million dollars, and none of us wanted to risk being the one to break it. So, naturally, we put it in our biggest operating room, OR 5.

Unfortunately, this posed another problem for us- we had nowhere to put the Jackson Table, our main operating table for complex spine surgeries. On top of that, we had nowhere to put *anything.* You see, the O Arm was so large, that it practically pushed everything in the back of OR 5 out the door. When we confronted our managers about our situation, they gave us the simple answer of, ""Just store them in Peds for now.""

Peds is short for the Pediatric wing, located within our abandoned COVID-19 Isolation wing. It's a long ways away from the OR, and as a 4'11"" nineteen year old girl, I wasn't going to move thousands of pounds worth of equipment all the way down there on my own. So, they paired me with a nurse who was floating around the OR at the time, and known for being the muscle of our department. We'll call him Mack.

That day, I was already exhausted and sleep deprived, and it was barely 7 in the morning when our managers sent us to do the task. Mack was grumpy, as he typically is in the morning (and always, with me), so I suggested we grab a coffee at the hospital coffee place to get amped up. He huffed at me, and reluctantly agreed. Mack and I don't exactly have the greatest relationship. Before I started dating my current boyfriend, I was a bit of a papa chaser. Mack is divorced with two children, and we spent a lot of time talking- he became like my therapist. And then, I 'fell in love' with him.

Of course, that freaked him out, because one, my mom is his best friend. And two, he's 23 years older than me. And while Mack was a bit of a womanizer, cradle-snatching wasn't really his style. So he told my mom. Cue the 4 months of awkward silence and bitter small talk. I wasn't bitter, but he expected me to be, so he became hostile back. Every time I asked for help, it was met with attitude. Every time I asked, *period*, it was met with sarcasm. Mack went from someone I absolutely loved, to someone I hated.

Then, he went from someone I hated, to someone I feared with my life.

As we sipped down on our coffee, he remarked, ""That's not even real coffee. You drink straight sugar. You know how many calories that is?""

""I could care less about how many calories is in it, old man.""

""It's *couldn't* care less. You *couldn't* care less.""

""Why are you so mean to me?""

""I'm correcting you. Can I not do that?""

""Correct this,"" I say, flipping him off.

""I'll break that damn finger off. Quit that."" He says sternly, and I close up. ""And I'm not mean to you. You know why things are like this now.""

I roll my eyes.

""I'm dating Jackie. Get over yourself."" I take another sip of my coffee.

""Sure, but you were still making moves on me. Mary, have you not once considered taking responsibility for that? You could have gotten me in a world of trouble, and I still haven't gotten a direct apology for it. It's not like this is just magically over because you moved on."" He looks down at me and I feel my face get hot with embarrassment. I'm bad at apologies.

""Yeah, but you didn't. You ran to my mommy like a little bitch."" I say, my embarrassment swallowing me whole. I know Mack wants to bark back at me, but he holds his composure, as we're still in our baby blue scrubs and there are patients around us.

""We can talk about this another time. And do not call me a bitch. You have no idea how much stress you caused me."" He tosses his empty cup of black roast coffee into the trash, and stands up off the lobby chair. He turns around and begins to walk back to the OR, and I cuss and mutter at him under my breath as I chase behind him like a duckling.

My close friends at work were all at breakfast, so it really was go-time before all the surgery cases started to get everything hauled down to Peds. Mack and I started with the 7D spine camera, a hulk-sized machine we use once in a blue moon, and pushed the beastly device down through isolation and into Peds, where Mack badged the two of us in.

""Hey, this badge reader is before my time. I'm gonna need to borrow yours."" I said to Mack as he parked the 7D machine into the first room we found. There was a small baby cradle inside splattered with a black substance, and we parked the 7D next to it and plugged it in. The black substance seemed to be dripping from the ceiling, and it smelled strongly like cleaning chemicals in the room. We look at it for a second in disgust, and then to each other.

""Gross. We should have them put a work order in, see that?"" Mack says, handing me his badge and looking up at the ceiling, almond eyes wide like quarters.

""Yeah, maybe find a place further down in Peds to park the 7D while I go grab the Jackson table. I can do it on my own, I just need help with some of the Tele stuff."" I reply to Mack.

""Mmkay. Sounds fine."" Mack says, unplugging the 7D and beginning to pull the machine away from the wall. ""Fuck, this place gives me the heebie jeebies.""

I nod in agreement and back out of the room, my chest beginning to feel uneasy. The dark rooms of the pediatric wing occasionally flickering to light. The dingy, mildewy smell. I've seen things, all sorts of things in the OR, but nothing made me feel quite like I wanted to vomit like this place did.

Right before I scanned my badge to open the exit door of Peds, I could have sworn I heard 3 distinctly different voices. I stopped in front of the door, and hushed my breath to listen. That's when I made them out.  A female toddler saying, ""Mommy, I want water!"", a baby fussing into a panicked cry, and a young boy, repeating,

""You're not my dad. You're not my dad. You're not my dad.""

I turned around, only to see Mack's faded silhouette pulling the 7D with ease down the distant and dusty hallway of Peds. I heard his familiar smoker-coughing a few yards away, which filled me with relief. I hated the guy, but he was a familiar in a place where I felt what I can only describe as absolute terror.

The lock clicked and the doors slowly opened when I badged out, letting me out into the safety of the rest of the hospital. The Isolation wing was abandoned, but not nearly as unsettling as Peds. I hurried back to the OR with Mack's badge to retrieve the Jackson table, when I ran into my coworker Dianne.

""Hey, are you still on breakfast?"" I asked her.

""No, what's up?""

""I just need help moving the Jackson table back into Peds. It's big and I told Mack I could do it myself, but honestly it's kind of a pain in the ass to do alone.""

Dianne agreed to help me and we entered OR 5, putting on our masks as our peers had already begun to open the sterile supplies.

""We're a bit behind, sorry,"" I say as we pull the table out, and the tech in the room just laughs and brushes us off. We moved the table out of the OR, and begin to move it through the hallway.

That's when I started to smell the burning.

I quickly asked Dianne if she smelled burning as we badged into Isolation, and she replied no, then asked me if I was smelling burnt toast. I said no, it smelled like when you burn bacon. We stopped for a second and smelled around, then came to the conclusion that her nose was probably stuffy and that I was probably smelling something from the hospital cafeteria.

""And they double the price of our lunch for what? Just to burn the damn food? Please."" Dianne says, when we arrive to Peds.

""Right? Figures. Hey I have to use Mack's badge, that's how long it's been since we've even used this shitty place.""

""Funny how that is. We're still 8 million in the hole yet can afford to have millions of dollars of equipment never get used and sit collecting dust in this abandoned wing. And how we can even afford to have an entire abandoned wing to begin with."" Dianne says as I press Mack's badge to the scanner. It doesn't recognize it. I scan it again. Nothing.

""Huh, I swear it worked when we badged in the first time."" I say.

""Lemme try. I've been here for 5 years."" Dianne says, putting her badge up to the scanner. It doesn't take.

""Sheeeeiittt. Welp, we're gonna have to ask the bosses for one of their badges."" I say.

""Well I kinda have to start setting up my room. I think Mack can help you cause he's already in there, but good luck!"" says Dianne, and I wave her off back to the OR.

I whip out my phone, and think about taking a video of the wing to send to my boyfriend, who loves weird, abandoned liminal spaces, when I hear a loud and aggressive pounding on the double doors to peds. Inside is completely dark from where I'm standing, but the pounding startles me to the point where I physically can't approach the doors to peer inside.

When the pounding stops, I exit my frozen state and slowly creep towards the door.

""Mack? MACK! Are you in there?"" I ask.

Then the knocking resumes, harder and faster than ever, as if it could break the door down. So hard that I bolt out of Isolation and back to the OR as quickly as I can to get my boss.

When I get there, trembling and in a sweat, I gently knock on my boss's door and she opens it. She sees me trembling in the legs, and I quickly explain my situation to her.

""M...Mack I think is stuck in Peds. He gave me his badge so I could get back in, but I c...can't. I need you to help me...I- I need the right badge."" I say in a panic.

""Here, take my badge. I'm sure you can open it with this one."" She says, handing me hers, and I look at her blankly.

""So go then? What are you waiting for?""

I couldn't explain to her the feeling I felt when I was there. It was goddamn awful, is what it was. But I had to go back... if not to do my job, for Mack. So I swallowed my fear and went back to Isolation, and stood at the door in front of Peds.

I was just being a baby, I thought to myself, I'm sure Mack is fine.

But when I got back, the pounding had stopped and one light was on inside. Then the rest flickered on. i figured Mack had found his way around and was fine, so I badged in the door and it unlocked just fine.

""Mack? Hey! I need some help out here! Mack!"" I said, immediately making my presence known like a white girl in a horror movie. I didn't see or hear him, but smelled oxidized blood- pretty typical for the OR, but not Peds. It made my stomach more nauseous than before. I looked around in a few rooms for Mack, nothing. I kept searching, empty room after empty room, becoming more and more paranoid as I searched for Mack before exiting the final room of Peds and running face first into him like a brick wall as I turned around. I shrieked as loud as I could as I looked up at him, and he stared at me blankly in return.

""Oh my God! Oh my God Mack you gave me a fucking heart attack!"" I say, genuinely afraid and genuinely angry. I punch him and he doesn't reach to defend himself, just lets me hit him. My punch lands on his arm like hitting a sack of potatoes. It feels wrong and uncomfortable, but I brushed it off as just me being paranoid and also feeling guilty for hitting him. Mack continues to look at me, without saying a word.

""I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry about everything... about flirting with you, about everything with my mom, about hitting you... can we just go back to normal? Can we just go back to being friends??"" I asked him, desperately and so spooked out of my mind I'm in tears.

Mack continues to look at me, and then smiles.

""You are... my friend."" He wheezes. ""We can. Go back...to normal."" It's like he's choking out the words. But he doesn't cough his typical smokers cough. And his smile is too big for his firm Korean complexion. His eyes pierce my soul, it's uncomfortable to look into them for too long.

""Hah... Haha. Okay... sorry I'm such a weenie,"" I said as wrapped my arms around him. ""Weenie."" He repeats back to me, in a clearer tone. He sounds more like himself.

""Hey, don't call me a weenie!"" I laugh, and he looks at me.

""Ha ha. Ha ha."" He repeats to me. My face drops.

""Okay stop that you're freaking me out."" I say.

""Okay."" He says, and stops smiling.

I look at him for a second longer, with unease, but I figure he's just being weird. The smell of oxidized blood follows us all the way out the door, until we get fresh air and move the Jackson table back into one of the other rooms. The feeling of the Pediatric wing doesn't bother me much anymore now that I'm with him, until I get close to the closed door where Mack put the 7D. When I go to put something in there, Mack grabs my arm and pulls me away without a word. I didn't want to upset him, as we were finally back on good terms, so I never protested. But something inside me wanted to see what was on the other side of the door.

When we were on our last run back to Peds, dropping off things we don't use much like the Sonopet, I tried to get to the door when Mack wasn't looking. I pulled the Sonopet close to the door with the 7D, and reached for the handle, when Mack grabbed me by the back of the neck.

""I'm sorry, okay?"" He said to me. I looked at him, wide eyed and completely frozen in fear. The smell of oxidized blood returned, as I made an uncomfortable eye contact with him. He turned me around, forcefully.

""Back. To normal."" He said, and pulled me by the hair out of Peds.



Over the course of the next few days, Mack didn't say much. In the breakroom, he would sit and listen. Observe political discourse between our coworkers about the current state of the world until he had something to say in return. Dianne and Jecka would talk to him about the gym and he would listen and nod. He stopped smiling weird, and began to laugh the way he used to laugh over time. His annoying roadrunner laugh was completely and all the way there, so I figured he had to have been in a slump when we went into Peds that day. When Eddie asked him about his bass, he boasted about how expensive it was and how it was a limited edition, telling him all about the frets and how he needs a new G string.

He was so convincing too. Until someone found the body.

On a day we had Dr. K in the OR, our main spine surgeon, Lori came to me and a few others in a panic. She rounded us up and brought us over to Peds in a hush. When we asked what all the fuss was about, she looked all around us and lowered her voice to a whisper.

""We needed imaging for the spine. So I went to look for the 7D... because we haven't used it and it would have come in handy for these fractures in the lower vertebrae..."" Lori's voice began to waver. I watched her open the door to find Mack's corpse lying on the floor next to the 7D machine in the room. The body was weeks old. Bloated, scrubs torn. And the face... Mack's face was charred off, as if it had been pressed against a gas stove until his skin caved to the burns. The corpse was unrecognizable, except for one minute detail that instantly signaled to me that it was Mack.

The tattoo barely exposed on his side under his armpit. It was a tattoo of a sparrow.

I'm the only person in our department who knows the tattoo because I used to stalk his Instagram, and he has a photo of himself shirtless flexing in the mirror, where you can clearly see the tattoo of the frail bird. In the frenzy of my coworkers gathering around and attempting to figure out who the charred and mangled corpse could be, I ran as fast as I could back to the OR, back to the breakroom where that... *thing* wearing Mack's skin was lazily lounging around and scrolling through his phone, learning God knows what.

If it was really Mack, he would remember the tussle we had.

""Hey, Mack."" I said to it, and it looked up from his phone and smiled.

""Mary! How ya doin?"" it replicated Mack's cheerful demeanor to the rhythm of which he would speak.

""Can we... go out to your car for a little? Have a little smoke break?""

""Of course!"" It stood up from the couch and walked out with me.

""I didn't know you smoked. Is that recent?"" It asked me and I tried to act casual. I won a film festival in high school for best acting. I'd better be convincing enough to get it to stay calm.

""No, actually. Been doing it a while."" I lied through my teeth.

Then the intercom activated, and the woman over the intercom spoke, ""Code Yellow, Pediatric Wing. Code Yellow, Pediatric Wing.""

I saw Mack's face drop slightly.

""Hey you remember what Code Yellow was?"" it asks me. I look at it. I stop for a second and look at my badge holder, which has all the codes on the back because mine was new.

""Code Yellow? Oh it says hazardous material. Must have been that black stuff dripping from the ceiling when we dropped off the 7D."" I say to it.

""Yeah, you know that's probably it. Weird though."" It says to me. Thank God. It bought my lie.

I get to Mack's car and we stand outside, it reaches into its pocket and pulls out a cigarette, offering me one. 

""Light me up,"" I say to it. We stand out there and smoke for a little while.

""Mack... I've been meaning to ask. How do you feel about me? I thought we had something. Why did you go and tell my mom? We could have been great.""

""Mary, because I'm too old for you. You know I adore you. But you know... it's a matter of maturity and whatnot. You understand. You're gorgeous and I'd absolutely do it if it weren't for the backlash."" it takes another drag at the cigarette as police sirens approach the building.

I knew it. I knew it wasn't Mack.

The first thing Mack always says every time I bring up the subject is that he and my mom are best friends.

""Yeah. I guess you're right... hey um... if it's too much to ask, can I maybe... see your back muscles one more time? I just... think they're so hot and like... you know..."" I say, beginning to pick at my skin. Mack laughs and leans against his car, flicking the butt of his cigarette away. He folds his arms and grins that uncanny grin again, for the first time in weeks.

""Code brown is hazardous material."" He says to me.

My heart drops to the pit of my stomach. He watches my eyes widen. He doesn't move or lunge at me, as I'm frozen in fear, so as soon as I feel like I can, I run. I run back towards the building, back to where I'm safe. He doesn't come after me, but his eyes follow me into the hospital until I can no longer see him through the windows.



A few weeks later, the police successfully identified the body as Mack's. They asked us a few questions, and attempted to track down the imposter. Said imposter never showed back up after my encounter with him at his car. His children were handed over to their mother, and the emptiness of the OR without Mack began to set in. I felt horrible. Miserable. I never got to tie up those loose ends with him because I was a coward, and because I was stubborn. I gave that thing my apologies.

My boyfriend Jackie was preparing for his trip to Japan, so I would have some time to think about the events that transpired over the next 3 weeks on my own. I still lived with my dad, so maybe it would be a good thing to get us talking again and not feeling like 2 strangers in the same home. My brother has had to keep me company because of the recurring nightmares I have every night, which I'm grateful for but ultimately a 17 year old teenage boy can only do so much for his older sister before he gets tapped out.

A few minutes after my dad and brother left to the gym, I got a knock on my door. When I opened it, Jackie was standing outside in sweats and a tee shirt. I smiled and gave him a hug, and we didn't even need to exchange words. We just felt it.

""I'm going to miss you in Japan baby. Ooh! Make sure to take this too. You need it for the photos."" I said, handing him my little LEGO figurine of myself that I send with my friends for all their trips.

""I'm going to miss you too baby."" He said and let go of me.

My phone then began to vibrate. It was his sister calling. I declined the call and continued talking to Jackie, who seemed very dry with his responses. I began to get sensitive at his signs of rejection and he responded, ""You know I adore you. You understand.""

Jackie's sister called again and I got frustrated and overwhelmed, and pulled myself away from Jackie.

""I'm sorry, I need to take this."" I said, and ran upstairs to my room and closed the door while Jackie waited patiently outside the front door, letting all the cold air in.

""What's going on? Are you okay?"" I asked as soon as I picked up the phone.

""It's... It's Jackie! Oh God he's dead Mary, he's dead and I don't know what to do-""

I locked my bedroom door.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iswzh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/situationshipsadvice/comments/1iswzh7/what_are_his_intentions/,What are his intentions?,"Hi everyone, I have a question or two that have been in my mind for a while since coming back from a NY trip. I visited a friend of mine that I have known for about 6 years since college (he and I met prior to transferring to our school). Since undergraduate, he moved to NYC with a now ex girlfriend and I've been broken up with my ex for almost 4 years now. Prior to this, in college, we also casually saw one another. If I am being fully honest, I have had a crush on him since meeting him but after he dated his ex I chose not to say anything because it's inappropriate. Fast forward to this past Friday, I flew to NY for the third time and saw him (we had seen each other last year in April)---what kinda makes this trip a bit different is that I had asked him what his feelings were towards me on NYE, but he was working that night and I said to forget about it. He had said to me that he respected my boundaries after I also brought to his attention that we didn't fully know one another unless we were in room having sex. I then consented to seeing him casually.

Going back to this past weekend, I was shocked at how hospitable he was with me since in college he wouldn't really try to hang out to get coffee as friends or wouldn't say hi in public settings. In this trip, I met someone completely new. Not only did he take me around the city, which I appreciated since I want to move there, but after a bar crawl we did (since it's his job it was actually fun seeing him do his bits and make people laugh) we were heading home for the night in which he was looking at something on his phone and he kissed me on the lips in public. Mind you, I have liked him since we were Sophomores so I was FEELING IT along with the alcohol! Prior to flying out, we were talking about bit more than usual and he was also flirting with me which he acknowledged doing so because he wanted to. On Sunday, I made a comment along the lines of, ""well, I have my make-up on. I'm not ugly now"" to which he said, ""you're not ugly. You're pretty"". I think I said that he says that to all the girls, but he responded ""I find you attractive. If I didn't, we wouldn't be sleeping with either"" which I get where it sounds crude, but because he and I have been honest and casual with one another I wasn't offended by the last part.

On my last day, before he left, we hugged and said the usual ""see you soon"". Before he left, he kissed me on the forehead and on the lips. I become a school girl when he does things like this and he knows that. I would ask him directly but I don't want a repeat of the NYE message. What are his intentions at this point? He and I are around the same age, both support our distinct career choices and there's chemistry between us.",1,1739939373.0,situationshipsadvice,0,1.0,False

1iswxyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1iswxyd/grand_hyatt_deer_valley_over_presidents_day/,Grand Hyatt Deer Valley over Presidents Day Weekend 2025,"(Long) Review of the new Grand Hyatt Deer Valley 

I stayed 4 nights this past Presidents Day Weekend at the Grand Hyatt Deer Valley. Leading up to it, I had read lots of reviews saying that it wasn't ready for prime time, but was hoping they'd have kinks worked out between a busy MLK weekend and now. It may be a little better, but there still was a lot left to be desired, mostly because of inconsistency in staff service/knowledge and communication between staff at the hotel. 

The hotel is gorgeous and the rooms are really nice. I had booked a standard room on points and kept checking online to see if a standard suite became available to use my SUA on. The week before our trip, I saw that a premium suite (Grand Suite with Balcony) became available on points (58,000 points per night) so grabbed that. The room was huge and had amazing views. The kitchenette had a Nespresso machine, hot water kettle, full sized fridge and freezer, microwave, dishwasher, wine glasses, glasses, plates, cups, silverware. It was really nice to have an additional half bathroom when traveling with 2 toddlers. 

I had requested via email upon booking that I wanted a crib, and was told that wouldn't be a problem. I also requested a rollaway bed and they said I'd have to see when I checked in because they didn't have many of them. Upon check in at 5 pm, I requested a crib and rollaway bed again and they said that housekeeping would get those set up right away because with the time change, it was already close to bedtime for my 2 year old. At 7:45 pm, after a few calls to the front desk, nobody had stopped by, so I called again and ask to remain on the line while the front desk person personally called housekeeping. She came back and said that housekeeping told her there were no more cribs or rollaways and she said, ""Someone was supposed to tell you that, but I guess that message didn't get communicated. Can I offer you a \*small\* (yes, she said small) credit for food and beverage?"" and I said, ""No, I don't want a food and beverage credit, I want a crib for my 2 year old to sleep in as promised."" She came back after speaking with the manager and said they found a Pack n Play for me. Okay, good enough...wish they would've just offered the pack n play to begin with. But they were definitely out of rollaway beds, so one of the adults slept on the couch the first night. The next day after some people checked out, they were able to bring a rollaway bed. 

Breakfast (7 to 10 am) was in the Grand Lounge on the 5th floor for Globalists. Now that it's up and running, they told me that complimentary breakfast was only in the Grand Lounge and not at the restaurant anymore. Breakfast opens at 7 am and it gets packed immediately with families wanting to get an early start on their ski day. It was an okay spread. Scrambled eggs (looks like it might be made from the egg in a carton stuff based on the consistency), oatmeal with toppings, charcuterie and cheese, fruits, smoked salmon/onions/capers, cereal, bagels, bread, pastries, juices, milk. There was a line to toast bagels and bread because there was only one toaster. It was very busy, but they were pretty good about replacing items as they ran out, so I think they've definitely worked that part out for breakfast at least. 

They don't serve lunch there, presumably because everyone is out skiing. But they do have snacks (noon to 4 pm) like Kind bars, Twix, fruit, chips. The drink refrigerator also has sodas, chocolate milk, and Perrier. There is always coffee, hot water, tea, and hot chocolate packets out. There's a water machine with filtered water and the good nugget type ice (I call it the Sonic ice). No alcoholic beverages. 

Hors d'oeuvres are served in the lounge from 5-7 pm. It was heavy enough to be dinner for all of us. The first night was a little sad - it was some kind of beef stir fry over white rice and mini egg rolls. Someone else in the lounge said that reheated egg rolls from a box were sad and that the food at Hyatt Place was better, lol. The second night it was better. It was steak with chimichurri sauce, potatoes, and some other sides. The third night it was little riblets with mac n cheese. Overall, it was decent. And it was free and convenient, so I was happy with it. 

They set out dessert from 7-9 pm. Nothing fancy, small lemon bars the first night, brownies the second and third night. They did run out of the lemon bars the first night at 7:15 with no plans to replenish, but they brought out fruit instead. They have board games in the lounge, and families would hang out there after dinner and play some of the games. 

There is an arcade lounge on the first floor with air hockey, ping pong table, a large area with beanbags and 4 TV screens to play video games, board games, and an arcade area with 4 or 5 games like pinball, pacman, street fighter, etc. Pretty cool for older kids. 

The pool and hot tub area is awesome. My kids loved swimming in the heated pool (it was a tad lukewarm for me considering it was blizzarding outside), and I loved the hot tubs (there are 3 I believe). Most times we were the only ones crazy enough to be out there because it was snowing and the wind was whipping the snow in our faces, but I think it was the toddlers favorite part of the trip, to swim while snow was accumulating on their heads. 

There is no self parking option, and it's $50 per night for valet ($60 for oversized cars). This was taken off the bill at the end for me (Globalist booking with points). I knew it was valet only ahead of time so brought lots of small bills for tipping them, we took the car in and out every day. During busy times people were waiting 30-45 minutes for valet to bring their cars around. The family we traveled with left 20 minutes after we left to drive to ski school in the morning and it took 30 minutes to get their car and between that and the traffic to park city, they were very very late to ski school. When I was checking out I heard someone giving feedback to the front desk that it took 45 minutes for them to get their car the day before and it was stressful for them. 

We had a major issue with miscommunication and our skis. When we arrived, we got a ticket for our skis and boots from the bellhop. We needed to leave early the next day to drive to the Snow Park Lodge area of Deer Valley to drop our kids off for ski school, so I went down to the front desk before breakfast and showed the person at the WOH desk the ticket that the bellhop gave us, and she said she would call and have them brought out front for us in a few minutes. 20 minutes later after breakfast, our car was out front, but no signs of our skis. The front desk person said they would call again. 10 minutes later, still no skis. At this point I was antsy because I knew traffic would get bad, so I took the kids in the car and my husband stayed behind to figure out the missing skis and catch a ride later with our friends. He said nobody knew what was going on, there was zero sense of urgency from the front desk person (who was very friendly and smiled a lot but didn't seem to know what was going on at all) and he literally walked downstairs with a manager to an ENTIRE SKI STORAGE LOCKER AREA THAT NOBODY TOLD US ABOUT!! I had read that there were ski lockers, but assumed it was just for people who rented skis from Ski Butlers. Turns out guests of the hotel get complimentary locker(s), take elevators from the south wing to level B1. Would have been nice if they told us this when the bellhop took our skis upon check in. Or if the check in person mentioned it. I just assumed they were stored in an area where they store luggage. So someone downstairs in the ski lockers was holding our skis and boots, but didn't know that they needed to be brought upstairs. Just major miscommunication between front desk, ski locker staff, and bellhop. We just kept our skis in our car for the rest of the time because we had to drive anyway to take our kids to ski school on subsequent days. The day of check out, I walked downstairs to look at the ski locker area and it's very nice. You can put on your boots down there and walk outside to an area where a shuttle picks you up with all of your gear and takes you uphill a few minutes to the base of the Keetley Express. You could also walk, but would be an uphill walk with your ski boots and carrying your skis and poles...probably better to wait for the shuttle. My kids don't know how to ski so going on the lift within walking distance of the hotel wasn't an option for us to get them to ski school. 

Ski school. It will be REALLY nice when they set up ski school in the East Village. The first day, we left at 7:45 am to drive to Snow Park Lodge and got stuck in traffic for AN HOUR. Miserable. There's an area where 2 lanes merge down to 1 and it's just bumper to bumper traffic until then. The next day we left at 6:45 am and found a place to have a leisurely breakfast close to Deer Valley. There was zero traffic (without traffic the drive from GH DV to Snow Park Lodge takes 20 minutes) and it was nice to get there early (they opened the lifts at 8 am and ski school drop off opened at 8:30 am). This was our first time at Deer Valley and we loved it. It's really, really pricey, but the kids loved ski school and the child care area, and as very beginner skiers, my husband and I had a great time. 

The shuttle to Park City. We had to use the shuttle because one of the main ski lifts (Sultan Express) broke down while we were on the East side, and that was the only way we could get back to the main area, and we needed to get there to pick up the kids. It leaves every 2 hours and it just happened to be leaving 20 minutes after we determined we would need to either shuttle it or Uber it to the other side. There was room for our 2 sets of skis and poles (they slid them under the seats) and we hopped on in our ski boots. The shuttle could fit about 12 people and it was first come first serve. I'm not sure if they would have called another shuttle if the shuttle was full, or if people would just have to wait for the next shuttle 2 hours later. It drops you off at City Hall in Park City, and from there we walked 3 minutes to the Transit Center and took a free bus to Snow Park Lodge. 

We ordered to go from Remington Hall for lunch one day (they won't deliver to the room but you can go get it take out). It was pretty good and took about 25 minutes to be ready. Our friends sat down and ordered and it took 40 minutes to get their food and their hamburger looked medium rare plus. We reserved the Remington Hall High Hot Chocolate for our 4 kids ahead of time (you can do this online). It was pricey, $25 per hot chocolate (comes with a red velvet cookie) and we ordered a 2 tier dessert tray ($32). The hot chocolate was very rich and delicious to the adults (basically tasted like melted chocolate) but the kids didn't really like it (I guess they like the thin, Swiss Miss stuff). You could add milk and whipped cream to it to thin it out. I wouldn't spend the money and do it again with young kids (their palettes are terrible), but older kids and adults would enjoy it. We ordered room service one night and just ordered off the kids menu, even for the adults. I was expecting to wait an hour, but they told us 25 minutes and it took them about 35 minutes. Gratuity is included in the service charge, but of course there's a line to leave an extra tip if you wish. 

Would I stay there again? Yes, on points, especially if a premium suite is available on points (I've booked it for next year already). I don't mind the drive to Snow Park Lodge, just have to time it right with valet and getting the skis from downstairs (now that I know that's where the skis are). Everyone was really nice, they just need to work on communication between the different services. It will be SO much better when the East Village is built out more and especially when there is a ski school set up there for the kids. Right now, there is a little temporary East Village Deer Valley trailer within walking distance of the hotel at the base of Keetley express where you can rent equipment and print out lift tickets. It closes at 5 pm, not 6 pm like the other Deer Valley rental areas (I tried picking up my kids skis the night before at 5:15 and was rejected..oops). ",1,1739939221.0,hyatt,0,1.0,False

I guess I'll start from the beginning, so it will be a long story, but will hopefully make sense at the end. I met my children's father when I was 16 and he was 18, back in 2002. We started dating and it was a typical on and off thing. We would break up for a period of time when he ""needed a break"" and then get back together a few days or so later. Well, I ended up pregnant about a year and a half into our relationship. I always give credit where credit is due, and even though we were young, he stuck by my side. We had a little girl in 2004 and moved in together. We struggled financially, mostly because he wouldn't get a job and contribute, so we spent the next couple of years moving in with my family, or his family and I worked as a waitress to try and make ends meet. During this time there were incidences of infidelity. Him talking to old girlfriends from high school. Me finding texts popping up on his phone from other women. Believing that he didn't do anything with these women and they were just friends, even though deep down I knew that he was cheating. I just wanted to keep my little family together and I guess I was naive and young enough to overlook the obvious. A few years later we were a little more financially independent. He finally starting working a trade and going to trade school. I was working in healthcare. We got an apartment together and I found myself pregnant shortly after we moved in. Throughout the pregnancy I found him talking to other women, but he always denied that there was anything going on. They were just friends.... I would get upset about it and then just let it go. I desperately wanted to make it work. We got engaged, started planning a wedding, made plans for the future. The obvious cheating never really stopped. I would call him out on it, he would deny it. He would call me names. Tell me that no one else would want me as I was a teen parent with no college education and two small children, and I believed him. I just dealt with it and hoped that things would get better after we got married. Flash forward to a horrible night when our two children were 2.5 and 6. I worked a second shift healthcare job and he went to trade school. We had a sitter stay with our children until he would get home from class. While I was working I got calls/texts from our babysitter that he hadn't returned home and he wasn't returning texts. I tried calling him and his phone went straight to voicemail. I had a gut feeling that something was wrong. I went home after my 3-11 shift to relieve our babysitter who had already stayed several hours longer than she was expected to. While I was relieving the sitter I got a phone call from the hospital that I had just left. They were calling to tell me that my fiance was brought in after a motor vehicle accident and I needed to get there immediately. The next 18 hours are a blur to this day, but ultimately, he had a traumatic brain injury, and was removed from life support after family was given a chance to say goodbye. I was now saddled with the devastating loss of my fiance and father of my children. I made it my priority and main goal to get myself and my children through this as best I could. I went to therapy immediately, and brought my children to a pediatric grief counselor right away. Weeks went by and we were doing the best we could to get by day to day. About a month after his accident, I finally received work that the accident report was ready. I went to the state police to get the report immediately. I had so many questions as to what caused his accident since there were no drugs or alcohol in his system and it was a single car accident. As I'm reading the report, my heart begins to race as I read that there was a witness to the accident... a ""Friend"" he has spent the evening with having coffee. She was driving being him when the accident occured. Her name and phone number were listed on the report. I called her immediately. When she answered and I told her who I was she said she was expecting the call and said nothing happened between them and they were just friends. She told me that if anything I should feel bad for her since she had to live with the trauma of seeing his accident.... I didn't really give a fuck. Throughout the next few months I found more and more women who he had been speaking to and likely hooking up with. It made my grief move faster in some ways, but it was so complicated, and I'm angry about it to this day, 15 years later. Those two young children are now adults. I've avoided telling them the truth about their dads accident and the details around our personal relationship all these years. I never wanted to taint their image of their father. My oldest has asked my numerous times to tell her what happened with his accident, how it happened, and many other details. I always kept things vague. She recently said that she has thought about getting a copy of the police report for her own personal reasons. I realised at that point that if she were to get the copy and see what I know is on it, that she might look at me like I've lied to her all these years. She may not understand that I was trying to protect her and her brother and preserve the memory of their father. I love my children more than anything in the world, and I want nothing more than to keep them safe, but I am not willing to lose their trust in me to protect him and his lies. Would I be the asshole if I sat them down and told them the truth about his accident? Would I be a horrible person to tell them that instead of spending that night at home with them like he was supposed to, he spent the night out with another women having ""coffee"", and lost his life for it? There is so much more to the story, including more details of the cheating that was found after his death, and even the possibility of a child of his that was conceived in one of his affairs (this I will NOT tell them unless there is substantial proof). But, am I an asshole for finally coming clean?",1,1739938908.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

For me, it’s the drink package. I like that it’s unlimited alcohol/soda and even though you don’t get water/specialty coffee, it’s still a lot less per day than packages on other cruise lines. 

I know this is based on the type of cruiser you are and how long your trip is as well, but I usually have a few drinks for Brunch, by the pool, for dinner, and then a few more while at the casino at night. That more than pays for itself!",7,1739938670.0,NCL,12,0.9,False

Have been doing strict carnivore now since few months and I am always scared of accidentally ingesting plants if I go out to eat.
