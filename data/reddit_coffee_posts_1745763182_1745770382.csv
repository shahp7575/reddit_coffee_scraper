I’m in the market for a new coffee grinder and I’m looking for some recommendations. I mostly brew pour-over and espresso, so I need something that offers consistent grind size and is easy to use. I’ve been using a cheap blade grinder, but he’s ready to upgrade to a burr grinder. I’ve seen some recommendations for Baratza grinders but have read mixed reviews about reliability. Cuisinart is cheaper, but I’m unsure if it’s worth it.

Any suggestions for coffee grinders that are high-quality but won’t break the bank?

Butchy rounded the last bend of his two-mile run, Chuck Mangione’s Feels So Good humming through his clunky cassette player, the tape warbling like a teenage movie soundtrack he didn’t know he was in. Running started for Golden Gloves training, a holdover from last year’s sub-novice semifinals. After watching Rocky one night, he’d pulled on gloves and chased that underdog rush. Boxing wasn’t his thing, but the rhythm—sweat, burn, quiet head—kept him hooked. So he ran. Sparred. Stayed sharp.
Julia, his girlfriend since ninth grade, sat in the bleachers, legs crossed, sketchbook on her lap. She was sketching some sun-bleached surfer dude, probably saying “gnarly” and smelling like coconut oil. Huntington was far from Miami. Maybe that was her point.
Butchy slowed to a walk, sweat dripping from his hair. He headed toward her.
“Gotta meet Vince at the gym in an hour,” he said, catching his breath. “Come on, I’ll drive you home.”
She snapped the sketchbook shut.
“What were you drawing?” he asked.
“Aw, nothing,” she said, tucking hair behind her ear. “Just bored waiting.”
Butchy grabbed the sketchbook, sneaking a peek. A sun-bleached smile stared back.
“Maybe your brain’s already on the beach,” he said, grinning crooked. “Your body’s just lagging behind.”
Julia rolled her eyes, smiling anyway, and got up to walk with him.
The Gym
Butchy and Vince sparred three days a week—Monday, Wednesday, Friday—at the Boxing Academy in Huntington. Usually, it was just two friends trading punches, staying fit, letting off steam. More habit than fight.
Today felt different.
They were in the third round, and Butchy wasn’t pulling back. He moved like he was back in last year’s Golden Gloves semifinals—fast, sharp, almost fierce. Vince felt the shift, each jab heavier, each combo quicker. Then Butchy threw a hard hook, clean into Vince’s midsection.
Vince dropped to one knee, breath gone, pain shooting through his chest.
“What the hell, man?” he gasped, glaring up at Butchy.
Butchy froze, snapping out of it. He reached down, pulling Vince up. “Sorry, man. Got carried away.”
Vince shook his head, yanking off his gloves. “I’m done. That was too much.”
They climbed out of the ring, sweat-soaked, shirts sticking. The gym’s stale smell—leather, canvas, old sweat—hung heavy, like it was waiting for something.
They sank onto a worn bench by the lockers, unwrapping their hands.
Vince rubbed his side, wincing. “So,” he said, breaking the quiet, “wanna tell your best friend what that was about? Fighting ghosts in there?”
Butchy fumbled with his glove laces, tied too tight. He didn’t look up.
“Got anything to do with leaving Julia for California Sunday?” Vince asked.
Butchy sighed, meeting his eyes. “You know me too well,” he said, a tired smile flickering.
“Yeah,” he admitted. “It’s Julia.”
He freed his hands, staring at them. “We’ve been together since ninth grade. Four years. She’s everything—sweet, smart, gorgeous. And yet…”
He trailed off. “I can’t wait to leave. I’m starting screenwriting in Southern California. My dream. New people, new life. I’m excited, Vince. And I feel guilty ‘cause I don’t feel bad about leaving her.”
Vince leaned back. “She’s going to Miami, right? Next weekend?”
Butchy nodded. “Yeah.”
“So you’re both moving on.”
“But she wants long-distance,” Butchy said. “I don’t. I’m not built for it.”
Vince shook his head. “That’s heavy, man.”
He glanced at his own wraps. “I’ve been with Deb four years too. Couldn’t leave her. She’s my world. That’s why we’re at Hofstra, staying local.”
He looked at Butchy. “You gotta be straight with Julia before Sunday. You owe her.”
Butchy unwrapped his knuckles, the cloth dropping like shed skin. The gym’s hum—fluorescent lights, faint sweat—felt heavier, like regret.
“I know,” he said. “I don’t want to hurt her.”
Vince stood, stretching his sore ribs. “Then do the right thing. Be a man about it.”
He grinned, crooked. “Now let’s shower before I fall over.”
Butchy gave a small smile. “Yeah. I’m taking Julia to the Sunrise Drive-In tonight. Our last movie.”
They walked to the locker room, side by side, steps matched, paths splitting.
Drive-In Movie
Butchy pulled into their usual spot at the Sunrise Drive-In as Grease’s opening credits rolled. Frankie Valli’s voice drifted through the speakers, singing over cartoon dancers introducing the cast. It felt right for a sentimental night—nostalgic, familiar.
He went through the routine. Popcorn, no butter. Supersized Pepsi, two straws. Snowcaps, Julia’s favorite. They came here twice a month, like clockwork.
Julia was glued to the screen, her art-major eye catching the animated intro’s flair. Butchy barely saw it. His mind churned—how to tell her he was done, not just with them, but with their whole life together. Long-distance wasn’t his plan.
He glanced at her. Blonde hair, blue eyes that could light up a room. Soap-opera perfect, girl-next-door and leading lady. Every guy at school would’ve killed to be him.
“You look distant,” she said, eyes on the screen. “Like you’re 2,700 miles away.” Her L.A. jab landed soft but heavy.
Butchy shoved popcorn in his mouth, gulped Pepsi, stalling.
“Seriously,” she said, voice softer. “It’s on my mind too. Four years together, and now… we’ll barely see each other.”
Her nose reddened, her telltale sign of tears. Her voice wavered.
Not now. He couldn’t break it off yet.
Butchy slid his arm around her, kissed her forehead. “This is our last movie here for a while. Let’s just enjoy tonight. Sunday’s coming fast—why rush it?”
She kissed his lips, soft, then turned back to the screen. Travolta and Newton-John sang “Summer Nights,” pulling the night back from the edge.
Butchy’s mind didn’t stop. Vince’s words from the gym echoed: Do the right thing.
He’d tell her. Just not tonight.
He had until Sunday.
Work with Mack
Saturday morning, Butchy walked into his Uncle Mack’s plumbing supply store. Mack, his mom’s older brother, had been a father figure since Butchy’s dad died when he was five. Mack told him to take the day off, but Butchy wanted one last shift before L.A. on Sunday.
Mack raised an eyebrow. “You don’t look as excited as I thought. Second thoughts about Julia?”
Butchy didn’t dodge. Mack always saw through him.
“Yeah,” he said, rubbing his neck. “Second thoughts about Julia. Not about leaving her. About breaking up with her.”
“Wow,” Mack said, surprised. “Didn’t know you two had problems. Sorry, kid.”
“That’s the thing,” Butchy said. “We don’t. It’s me. I’m stoked for L.A.—USC, screenwriting, beaches, nightlife. A fresh start. New people, new life.”
He paused. “That doesn’t mix with long-distance. Not with my high school sweetheart.”
Mack listened, quiet.
“I know what I’ve got with Julia,” Butchy went on. “She’s gorgeous, loyal. But not every relationship lasts forever. I might regret this, but I don’t think I will.”
He looked at Mack. “Does that make sense?”
Mack took a breath. “It’s your life, kid. Big step. You’ll live with whatever you choose.”
He softened. “I’m proud you’re thinking about school first. Your mom’s worked hard for USC. Focus, get your grades up.”
Mack’s voice warmed. “Do what feels right. No regrets, no looking back.”
Butchy nodded. “I’m almost there. Just gotta tell Julia. That’s the hard part.”
Mack clapped his shoulder. “I’ve always had faith in you. Since you won that swimming medal at eight. ‘Boy wonder,’ I thought.”
Butchy grinned.
“Now get moving,” Mack said, nudging him. “Mrs. Banks on Spring Lane called. Leak under her sink. Probably a washer. Fix it.”
Butchy grabbed his tool bag, glad for the distraction.
At the door, Mack called, “Hey. Whatever comes, I’m in your corner.”
Butchy nodded and stepped into the morning.
Mrs. Banks
The doorbell rang. Mrs. Banks opened it, waving Butchy in. On the TV, a yoga instructor bent into downward dog. She wore yellow terry cloth shorts and a sports bra, hair pulled back, looking like Cheryl Tiegs in that ‘70s poster. Yoga kept her fit past forty. Butchy tried not to stare.
“How’s your mom?” she asked, dabbing her forehead with a towel. “Haven’t seen her in a while.”
“She’s good,” Butchy said. “Lots of overtime at the hospital.”
Mrs. Banks smiled. “We were tight in high school. Always said she’d be a pretty nurse.”
Butchy lifted his toolbox. “Got the washer to fix. Won’t take long.”
“Bathroom’s this way,” she said, leading him down the hall.
“Big bathroom,” Butchy said, stepping in.
“Divorce a rich lawyer, you keep the big house,” she smirked.
“Remind me to marry one,” Butchy shot back.
They laughed.
Butchy crouched by the sink, checking the pipes. “Need a new washer and slip nut,” he said. “It’ll be good.”
Mrs. Banks knelt behind him. “Let me see.”
He pointed. “Right there.”
She leaned close, her chin brushing his shoulder. He turned. Her blue eyes locked on his. She kissed him, and they shared a brief, impulsive moment.
After, she smoothed her hair, stretching like a cat. “Back to work, Tiger. I’ve got a nail appointment in two hours.”
Butchy, dazed, dressed and fixed the sink. She lit a cigarette, made coffee.
“All done,” he said.
She walked him to the door. “Good job. In more ways than one,” she grinned, offering a twenty.
He waved it off. “Not necessary.”
“Thank Mack for me. That leak was driving me nuts. Tell your mom hi.”
Butchy paused. “Yeah… sure.”
Driving off in the van, he laughed. “How was I supposed to see that coming?”
Girls Confiding
Julia sat on her bed, knees up, fan brushing hair from her face. Her phone felt warm, her voice caught between steady and breaking.
Blocks away, Deb answered in the kitchen, her mom stirring cake batter, humming to Fleetwood Mac’s Rhiannon on a small radio.
“I got it, Mom,” Deb said, taking the phone to her room.
She shut the door, picked up the extension. “Okay, Jules. What’s wrong? You crying?”
A long pause.
“I think it’s over,” Julia said. “He’s breaking up with me tomorrow.”
Deb sat on her bed. “What? Why do you think that?”
“He’s packing tonight. Says he’s got a lot on his mind. Four years, Deb, and he doesn’t want to see me before L.A.”
Her voice cracked.
“He’ll see me at the track tomorrow. One last jog. He’s so distant. Like I don’t know him.”
Deb twisted the phone cord. “He’s probably scared.”
“Of what?” Julia snapped, then softened.
“Of everything. Commitment. The future. Your feelings. You’re going to Miami, right? You’re not staying local.”
Julia laughed, bitter. “Yeah, but I’d make time for him tonight.”
“I know,” Deb said. “Maybe he’s freaking out. You’re beautiful, smart. He’s jealous of that surfer you sketched, remember?”
“Last night at the movies,” Julia said, “he was so off. Kissed my forehead, arm around me, then… nothing. Like he’d decided something.”
Deb paused. “It’s a big weekend. He’s never flown, now he’s moving across the country. He’s shutting down.”
“You okay?” Deb asked.
“I wish I was,” Julia said. “I love him, Deb. More than I can explain. But if he’s breaking up…”
Her breath hitched.
“I’m coming over,” Deb said, standing. “We’ll get pizza, laugh at tourists.”
“No,” Julia said. “If he needs to think, I do too. We’ll settle it tomorrow.”
She softened. “Go out with Vince. Enjoy your night.”
“I might,” Deb said. “Call me after, okay?”
“Okay, sister girl.”
“I love you,” Deb said. “You’re my best friend.”
“Love you too,” Julia said.
The Encounter
Butchy lay on his bed, staring at the ceiling, waiting for answers. None came. His mind raced, stuck in a loop.
Dinner was lasagna and meatballs, his favorite. A quiet sendoff. His mom hugged him tight in the kitchen, holding on. She had a double shift at the hospital—her way of coping.
She couldn’t face his morning departure. Too much unsaid. They said goodbyes early. She made him promise to call from his dorm. He did. They hugged again. She left.
The house went silent, heavy.
The doorbell cut through. Butchy sat up slow, went downstairs. Deb stood at the door, platform shoes making her almost his height.
She got to the point. “What’s going on with you and my friend?”
Butchy sighed. “It’s complicated, Deb. Everything’s changing. My head’s spinning. I’ve never felt this way. Like I’m not in control.”
“Not in control?” Deb crossed her arms. “Of what?”
He looked past her, into the dark. “The consequences. What my choices might cost.”
Deb’s eyes narrowed, voice sharp. “Let’s stop dancing around it. You’re planning to break up with Julia tomorrow before L.A. You want out of Huntington, your big moment, independence—Mr. Adult. But you know the cost. Julia. The best thing that ever happened to you. And that’s scaring you.”
Butchy didn’t argue. “Yeah. That’s what’s freaking me out.”
Deb eased up. “I’m not here to fight for Julia or push you. That’s your call. But act like the adult you wanna be. Fish or cut bait. Stop stringing her along. Settle it tomorrow, ‘cause this is killing her.”
She stepped back. “I’m meeting Vince. See you at the airport.”
Butchy nodded. “You’re a good friend, Deb. Thanks.”
She hugged him quick. “I have faith in you. You’ll do the right thing.”
She left. The silence returned, heavier, waiting for his choice.
The Talk
Sunday morning, 7:30 a.m. Butchy hit the high school track, earphones in, sneakers pounding. His last jog before L.A. The track was his safe spot—where he thought, breathed, escaped. Today, it felt heavy, like it knew what was coming.
Vince and Deb’s words echoed: Fish or cut bait.
He finished his lap, sweat soaking his shirt, pulse louder than the music. His eyes drifted to the bleachers.
Julia. Her usual spot. Like always.
She sat cross-legged, doodling in her sketchbook, her art her own escape. She looked up as he stopped.
They met halfway, a few feet apart.
“Hey,” they said together, nervous, overlapping.
Julia spoke first. “You needed to think last night. So… where are we? I need to know.”
Butchy met her blue eyes, the ones he’d loved since freshman year. His chest tightened, not from running. He thought he could let her go. Now? He wasn’t sure.
“Long-distance might not work,” he said, voice low. “Opposite coasts. Heavy classes. New people. New adventures. L.A. and Miami are like different planets. We owe ourselves to live it. All of it.”
Julia didn’t flinch or cry. She looked strong, not like the drive-in’s heartbreak.
“I’ve been thinking,” she said. “Maybe I was wrong about long-distance. I could’ve stayed local, gone to Hofstra like Vince and Deb. But I chose Miami. The art program’s great, but the beaches, the life—that pulled me too. I thought we could stay the same. We can’t.”
Butchy sighed, half relief, half regret. Not what he expected, but maybe what they needed.
“Never thought it’d go like this,” he said. “But we’re on the same page.”
A quiet settled. A dog barked far off. A breeze flipped a page in Julia’s sketchbook.
She stepped closer, voice steady. “We’ve been through so much. Going our own way doesn’t mean I stop loving you.”
Butchy swallowed hard. “I love you too, Julia. I don’t know how long-distance’ll go. But I don’t want us to end.”
She took his hand, warm, steady.
“Then we try.”
The Ride
Mack pulled up in his 1972 Chevy Nova, the engine rumbling low. Butchy stood out front, duffel bag at his feet, ready but holding back a little.
He tossed the bag in the backseat and slid into the passenger seat.
“I can’t believe it’s here,” Mack said, eyes on the road. “Felt like this day would never come. Now it’s just… here.”
“Yeah,” Butchy said, settling in. “Been a wild couple of days, to say the least.”
Mack glanced over, keeping it light. “So… you work things out with Jules?”
Butchy nodded slow. “Yeah. We’re gonna do our own thing at college. Live it up. But we’re trying long-distance. Been through too much to just let it go.”
Mack smiled, glad. “That’s a big call, man. I’m happy for you two. Always been something real there.”
Mack flipped the radio on. Chuck Mangione’s Feels So Good drifted out, jazzy and warm, like it knew the moment.
Butchy stared out the windshield, calm, satisfied, like he’d made it through a storm and found peace.
Mack let the quiet hang, then glanced again. “Hey, let me ask you something. You were gone a long time yesterday just changing a washer at Mrs. Banks’ place. What really went down?”
Butchy turned, a slow, cat-like grin spreading. He looked back at the windshield, saying nothing.
Mack laughed, shaking his head. “Never cease to amaze me. Still the boy wonder.”",1,1745770030.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

This is the first time I've ever had any kind of issue like this — I've never even had a single pimple before.
I'm 20 years old, and my skin has always been very clear.

I mostly eat homemade food with very little oil or spices. I’m not a huge fan of sugar either, though I occasionally have chocolate, cold coffee, or ice cream — but I've been eating these for years without any problems.
Suddenly, these small bumps appeared out of nowhere, and they just won't go away.

One thing I suspect might be the water I use to wash my face — I think it has a high iron content, and maybe that's affecting my skin.
As for skincare, I don’t use many products. For the past two years, I’ve only used Cetaphil moisturizer. About three months ago, I also added the Cetaphil cleanser and Cetaphil sunscreen.
Before that, it was just the moisturizer.

I'm really confused and frustrated.

Let me tell you, maceration is real but to a certain point. I does work on every fragrance but not as much on all.

I asked my friend to put some in a decant and every few days I went to smell it and every time the scent became richer and a bit fresher, now it smells good but I don't think it reached his maximum. I got my hands on cdnim edt from Amazon and when I first smelled it the harsh/horrible lemon made me want to throw out so I sprayed like 10 sprays outside let it sit for the next day and just decided to return it but just to see if maceration works i sprayed some in a decant and a month later the harsh lemon is 90% gone and now it smells like Mont Blanc Explorer as I never smelt Aventus, like a lemon shaving cream, absolutely no pineapple. I got also Vanille en Tobacco by Fragrance World, didn't do much research but a friend of mine got a fake bottle of like 15ml of Tobacco Vanille that I really liked so I went for it and the first few hours it smelt like medecine kind of syrup and on the drydown smelt cinnamon and vanilla and now it is the same with syrup on the opening but not like medecine.

You stand there, chest puffed out, maybe you even look down your nose at that know-it-all sitting in the front row, or the ass kisser sitting on the CEO's metaphorical lap? You do it just to keep up appearances, perhaps just to test out what it feels like.

But ... You know. Your group knows, and the people praising you know that you were just the chump tasked with cleaning up the lab, or the try-hard that ""proof read"", the groups publication, identifying several agregious uses of run-on sentences and improper punctuation.

You know you're just a fake.  A glory leech.  You want the credit, you need that praise.  You just weren't good enough, smart enough, talented or trusted enough to make any meaningful contribution.

But hey! You're still part of the team right?  It's not your fault they wouldn't let you make decisions.  

Sure you get to decide how much hazelnut flavoring to squirt into each coffee cup, but you'd better just leave the important stuff to your betters.

This is a very long way to describe a feeling.  A feeling I'm not sure has a name, not a single name anyway.

It's that feeling that comes once every 6 months.  When the clothes come off and the lights go out.  You convince yourself that it's because of you. 

You're the reason intimacy is happening.  Your patience has finally paid off.  You haven't rocked the boat or complained about the infrequency, because when you do, all you care about is sex.  

You lay there in the afterglow, wondering why you ever thought of yourself as a third wheel on the 10-speed coasting at a moderate pace down the road.

Then it's right back to the front of the room.  Sure.  You got the participation trophy.  You did stuff and it was really appreciated... Really. 

I mean you were physically there right? 

Only it wasn't your idea. It wasn't anything you did or didn't do.  It was the fact that you have a hole, (or a pole), and the group decided it was time to use it.  

Here's the truth.  You're not wanted.  You're not desired.  You're not powerful.  You control nothing of any import.  

I just want to mean something to someone.  I have so much time and energy that has no outlet.  I don't just want to feel good, I want to make someone feel good. 

I don't just want to just be desired, I want to make someone else feel desired. I want to feel needed and to need someone in return.

But don't worry.  You're definitely a member of the team.  So smile and take credit for other people's decisions.  ",1,1745769712.0,u_bwhc77,0,1.0,False

Having used it daily over the past few weeks, I must say, I’ve got a lot of good stuff—and a few quirks—to share about this compact system.

**Sleek Design and Compact Build**  
This espresso machine shines on the countertop, both literally and figuratively. Its stainless steel finish doesn’t just look good; it’s also surprisingly resistant to stains and easy to clean. It occupies minimal space, which was a huge plus in my already cramped kitchen. My cousin, who recently set up a small office, commented on how perfect this would be for limited spaces. I agree—it’s not bulky and blends effortlessly with other appliances.

[Check LERTIN EM626 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dkdspmrc/)  

**Professional Pressure for that Perfect Coffee**  
This machine boasts a 20-bar pressure system, and it does deliver on its promise of rich, flavorful espresso. When I poured my first shot, I was impressed with the beautiful crema that topped it off. The strength of the brews was consistent, thanks to its efficient extraction abilities. Another friend who fancies herself a barista tried it during a brunch and raved about how close it came to café-quality. Adding ice water to the tank for a cold brew was refreshing, and in seconds, it extracted vibrant flavors without tasting watered down.

**Steam Wand with Multiple Functions**  
The star of the show, for me, is its steam wand. Frothing milk was a breeze—not only did it produce dense, glossy foam, but it also worked like a charm for heating up other drinks. My roommate, however, pointed out how beginner-friendly it was, as the removable 360° nozzle makes cleaning much more manageable. The build includes a rubberized sleeve over the wand, keeping safety in mind as I wasn’t too worried about accidental burns.

**Controls and Display**  
Equipped with a high-definition display, it lets you track brew time and temperature, which is more useful than I expected. I’m guilty of over-extracting coffee occasionally, but with this, it’s easy to keep an eye on brewing precision. Preheating takes about 16 seconds—a real lifesaver during rushed mornings before work. Plus, the PID temperature control ensures every cup stays consistently delicious. My coffee has been noticeably smoother compared to my previous machine that was less precise.

**Benefits**  
- Compact and stylish design fits small spaces effortlessly.  
- 20-bar pressure produces café-quality espresso with rich crema.  
- Customizable brewing options for single, double, or user-defined shots.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The machine is semi-automatic, which could be a learning curve for absolute beginners.  
- The milk frother can splash slightly if you’re unfamiliar with steam wands.  
- The water tank might feel cumbersome for smaller households given its 57.5oz capacity.  

**Easy Maintenance Features**  
The removable water tank holds up to 1.7 liters, which translates to several cups before needing a refill. One feature I particularly appreciated was the visual indication when the drip tray fills up. It’s all so intuitive that even my five-year-old niece was curious and said, “It’s like a robot talking to you!” Cleaning, which often feels like a chore, became relatively quick thanks to its detachable components like the drip tray and nozzle.

**Competing Brands**  
When compared to brands like Breville or De’Longhi, this machine offers nearly the same bar pressure and design sophistication but at a more approachable cost. Breville models tend to skew pricier, often including more advanced automation, which may appeal to tech enthusiasts. On the other hand, De’Longhi is similar in pricing and semi-automation but lacks the ultra-fast preheating that this coffee maker flaunts. Where it does fall slightly short is in the variety of presets compared to those competitors.

**Price Worthiness**  
The price point of the LERTIN EM626 is where this machine stands out. It balances high-end performance with affordability. Machines running professional-grade bar pressure with similar milk frothers often lean into the luxury price range. Given these considerations and its reliability in creating quality espresso, I’d say it offers a perfect equilibrium of price and performance.

1k97c3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/questions/comments/1k97c3m/what_powdered_milk_tastes_good/,What powdered milk tastes good?,"I'm so disappointed. I'm trying to use powdered milk instead of fresh milk going forward cause it's always been so wasteful. I actually am not a fan of the taste of dairy in most things and generally opt out for plant based alternatives, so it doesn't make sense to buy it for those few special recipes and let the rest just spoil and go to waste since I won't use it for anything else.

But there are some things, mostly comfort foods, that require dairy or they just don't do the trick of capturing the nostalgia of the traditional recipe I love (white country gravy, cornbread, etc.) So I thought powdered milk would be my saving grace. Except it tastes so bad to me and not like milk at all. So far I tried it in cornbread, to fluff up some scrambled eggs, and in a cup of coffee. This strange completely non-milk tasting flavor and aftertaste  just over powers everything! I can't describe it but it's not pleasant. 

I did some research before buying and was told whole milk powder specifically was the way to go. This is the one I got...

*'The Saco Pantry' instant whole milk powder, fortified with vitamins A & D*

Is there another brand I should be getting? Is this just the way it is and I'm meant to get used to the flavor? Maybe I need to fudge the rehydrating ratios? 

Any advice?

TLDR: Any tips on getting rehydrated powdered milk to taste better?",0,1745769648.0,questions,5,0.5,False
1k97bvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1k97bvw/rf_the_boy_wonder/,[RF] The Boy Wonder.,"The Track
Butchy rounded the last bend of his two-mile run, Chuck Mangione’s Feels So Good humming through his clunky cassette player, the tape warbling like a teenage movie soundtrack he didn’t know he was in. Running started for Golden Gloves training, a holdover from last year’s sub-novice semifinals. After watching Rocky one night, he’d pulled on gloves and chased that underdog rush. Boxing wasn’t his thing, but the rhythm—sweat, burn, quiet head—kept him hooked. So he ran. Sparred. Stayed sharp.
Julia, his girlfriend since ninth grade, sat in the bleachers, legs crossed, sketchbook on her lap. She was sketching some sun-bleached surfer dude, probably saying “gnarly” and smelling like coconut oil. Huntington was far from Miami. Maybe that was her point.
Butchy slowed to a walk, sweat dripping from his hair. He headed toward her.
“Gotta meet Vince at the gym in an hour,” he said, catching his breath. “Come on, I’ll drive you home.”
She snapped the sketchbook shut.
“What were you drawing?” he asked.
“Aw, nothing,” she said, tucking hair behind her ear. “Just bored waiting.”
Butchy grabbed the sketchbook, sneaking a peek. A sun-bleached smile stared back.
“Maybe your brain’s already on the beach,” he said, grinning crooked. “Your body’s just lagging behind.”
Julia rolled her eyes, smiling anyway, and got up to walk with him.
The Gym
Butchy and Vince sparred three days a week—Monday, Wednesday, Friday—at the Boxing Academy in Huntington. Usually, it was just two friends trading punches, staying fit, letting off steam. More habit than fight.
Today felt different.
They were in the third round, and Butchy wasn’t pulling back. He moved like he was back in last year’s Golden Gloves semifinals—fast, sharp, almost fierce. Vince felt the shift, each jab heavier, each combo quicker. Then Butchy threw a hard hook, clean into Vince’s midsection.
Vince dropped to one knee, breath gone, pain shooting through his chest.
“What the hell, man?” he gasped, glaring up at Butchy.
Butchy froze, snapping out of it. He reached down, pulling Vince up. “Sorry, man. Got carried away.”
Vince shook his head, yanking off his gloves. “I’m done. That was too much.”
They climbed out of the ring, sweat-soaked, shirts sticking. The gym’s stale smell—leather, canvas, old sweat—hung heavy, like it was waiting for something.
They sank onto a worn bench by the lockers, unwrapping their hands.
Vince rubbed his side, wincing. “So,” he said, breaking the quiet, “wanna tell your best friend what that was about? Fighting ghosts in there?”
Butchy fumbled with his glove laces, tied too tight. He didn’t look up.
“Got anything to do with leaving Julia for California Sunday?” Vince asked.
Butchy sighed, meeting his eyes. “You know me too well,” he said, a tired smile flickering.
“Yeah,” he admitted. “It’s Julia.”
He freed his hands, staring at them. “We’ve been together since ninth grade. Four years. She’s everything—sweet, smart, gorgeous. And yet…”
He trailed off. “I can’t wait to leave. I’m starting screenwriting in Southern California. My dream. New people, new life. I’m excited, Vince. And I feel guilty ‘cause I don’t feel bad about leaving her.”
Vince leaned back. “She’s going to Miami, right? Next weekend?”
Butchy nodded. “Yeah.”
“So you’re both moving on.”
“But she wants long-distance,” Butchy said. “I don’t. I’m not built for it.”
Vince shook his head. “That’s heavy, man.”
He glanced at his own wraps. “I’ve been with Deb four years too. Couldn’t leave her. She’s my world. That’s why we’re at Hofstra, staying local.”
He looked at Butchy. “You gotta be straight with Julia before Sunday. You owe her.”
Butchy unwrapped his knuckles, the cloth dropping like shed skin. The gym’s hum—fluorescent lights, faint sweat—felt heavier, like regret.
“I know,” he said. “I don’t want to hurt her.”
Vince stood, stretching his sore ribs. “Then do the right thing. Be a man about it.”
He grinned, crooked. “Now let’s shower before I fall over.”
Butchy gave a small smile. “Yeah. I’m taking Julia to the Sunrise Drive-In tonight. Our last movie.”
They walked to the locker room, side by side, steps matched, paths splitting.
Drive-In Movie
Butchy pulled into their usual spot at the Sunrise Drive-In as Grease’s opening credits rolled. Frankie Valli’s voice drifted through the speakers, singing over cartoon dancers introducing the cast. It felt right for a sentimental night—nostalgic, familiar.
He went through the routine. Popcorn, no butter. Supersized Pepsi, two straws. Snowcaps, Julia’s favorite. They came here twice a month, like clockwork.
Julia was glued to the screen, her art-major eye catching the animated intro’s flair. Butchy barely saw it. His mind churned—how to tell her he was done, not just with them, but with their whole life together. Long-distance wasn’t his plan.
He glanced at her. Blonde hair, blue eyes that could light up a room. Soap-opera perfect, girl-next-door and leading lady. Every guy at school would’ve killed to be him.
“You look distant,” she said, eyes on the screen. “Like you’re 2,700 miles away.” Her L.A. jab landed soft but heavy.
Butchy shoved popcorn in his mouth, gulped Pepsi, stalling.
“Seriously,” she said, voice softer. “It’s on my mind too. Four years together, and now… we’ll barely see each other.”
Her nose reddened, her telltale sign of tears. Her voice wavered.
Not now. He couldn’t break it off yet.
Butchy slid his arm around her, kissed her forehead. “This is our last movie here for a while. Let’s just enjoy tonight. Sunday’s coming fast—why rush it?”
She kissed his lips, soft, then turned back to the screen. Travolta and Newton-John sang “Summer Nights,” pulling the night back from the edge.
Butchy’s mind didn’t stop. Vince’s words from the gym echoed: Do the right thing.
He’d tell her. Just not tonight.
He had until Sunday.
Work with Mack
Saturday morning, Butchy walked into his Uncle Mack’s plumbing supply store. Mack, his mom’s older brother, had been a father figure since Butchy’s dad died when he was five. Mack told him to take the day off, but Butchy wanted one last shift before L.A. on Sunday.
Mack raised an eyebrow. “You don’t look as excited as I thought. Second thoughts about Julia?”
Butchy didn’t dodge. Mack always saw through him.
“Yeah,” he said, rubbing his neck. “Second thoughts about Julia. Not about leaving her. About breaking up with her.”
“Wow,” Mack said, surprised. “Didn’t know you two had problems. Sorry, kid.”
“That’s the thing,” Butchy said. “We don’t. It’s me. I’m stoked for L.A.—USC, screenwriting, beaches, nightlife. A fresh start. New people, new life.”
He paused. “That doesn’t mix with long-distance. Not with my high school sweetheart.”
Mack listened, quiet.
“I know what I’ve got with Julia,” Butchy went on. “She’s gorgeous, loyal. But not every relationship lasts forever. I might regret this, but I don’t think I will.”
He looked at Mack. “Does that make sense?”
Mack took a breath. “It’s your life, kid. Big step. You’ll live with whatever you choose.”
He softened. “I’m proud you’re thinking about school first. Your mom’s worked hard for USC. Focus, get your grades up.”
Mack’s voice warmed. “Do what feels right. No regrets, no looking back.”
Butchy nodded. “I’m almost there. Just gotta tell Julia. That’s the hard part.”
Mack clapped his shoulder. “I’ve always had faith in you. Since you won that swimming medal at eight. ‘Boy wonder,’ I thought.”
Butchy grinned.
“Now get moving,” Mack said, nudging him. “Mrs. Banks on Spring Lane called. Leak under her sink. Probably a washer. Fix it.”
Butchy grabbed his tool bag, glad for the distraction.
At the door, Mack called, “Hey. Whatever comes, I’m in your corner.”
Butchy nodded and stepped into the morning.
Mrs. Banks
The doorbell rang. Mrs. Banks opened it, waving Butchy in. On the TV, a yoga instructor bent into downward dog. She wore yellow terry cloth shorts and a sports bra, hair pulled back, looking like Cheryl Tiegs in that ‘70s poster. Yoga kept her fit past forty. Butchy tried not to stare.
“How’s your mom?” she asked, dabbing her forehead with a towel. “Haven’t seen her in a while.”
“She’s good,” Butchy said. “Lots of overtime at the hospital.”
Mrs. Banks smiled. “We were tight in high school. Always said she’d be a pretty nurse.”
Butchy lifted his toolbox. “Got the washer to fix. Won’t take long.”
“Bathroom’s this way,” she said, leading him down the hall.
“Big bathroom,” Butchy said, stepping in.
“Divorce a rich lawyer, you keep the big house,” she smirked.
“Remind me to marry one,” Butchy shot back.
They laughed.
Butchy crouched by the sink, checking the pipes. “Need a new washer and slip nut,” he said. “It’ll be good.”
Mrs. Banks knelt behind him. “Let me see.”
He pointed. “Right there.”
She leaned close, her chin brushing his shoulder. He turned. Her blue eyes locked on his. She kissed him, and they shared a brief, impulsive moment.
After, she smoothed her hair, stretching like a cat. “Back to work, Tiger. I’ve got a nail appointment in two hours.”
Butchy, dazed, dressed and fixed the sink. She lit a cigarette, made coffee.
“All done,” he said.
She walked him to the door. “Good job. In more ways than one,” she grinned, offering a twenty.
He waved it off. “Not necessary.”
“Thank Mack for me. That leak was driving me nuts. Tell your mom hi.”
Butchy paused. “Yeah… sure.”
Driving off in the van, he laughed. “How was I supposed to see that coming?”
Girls Confiding
Julia sat on her bed, knees up, fan brushing hair from her face. Her phone felt warm, her voice caught between steady and breaking.
Blocks away, Deb answered in the kitchen, her mom stirring cake batter, humming to Fleetwood Mac’s Rhiannon on a small radio.
“I got it, Mom,” Deb said, taking the phone to her room.
She shut the door, picked up the extension. “Okay, Jules. What’s wrong? You crying?”
A long pause.
“I think it’s over,” Julia said. “He’s breaking up with me tomorrow.”
Deb sat on her bed. “What? Why do you think that?”
“He’s packing tonight. Says he’s got a lot on his mind. Four years, Deb, and he doesn’t want to see me before L.A.”
Her voice cracked.
“He’ll see me at the track tomorrow. One last jog. He’s so distant. Like I don’t know him.”
Deb twisted the phone cord. “He’s probably scared.”
“Of what?” Julia snapped, then softened.
“Of everything. Commitment. The future. Your feelings. You’re going to Miami, right? You’re not staying local.”
Julia laughed, bitter. “Yeah, but I’d make time for him tonight.”
“I know,” Deb said. “Maybe he’s freaking out. You’re beautiful, smart. He’s jealous of that surfer you sketched, remember?”
“Last night at the movies,” Julia said, “he was so off. Kissed my forehead, arm around me, then… nothing. Like he’d decided something.”
Deb paused. “It’s a big weekend. He’s never flown, now he’s moving across the country. He’s shutting down.”
“You okay?” Deb asked.
“I wish I was,” Julia said. “I love him, Deb. More than I can explain. But if he’s breaking up…”
Her breath hitched.
“I’m coming over,” Deb said, standing. “We’ll get pizza, laugh at tourists.”
“No,” Julia said. “If he needs to think, I do too. We’ll settle it tomorrow.”
She softened. “Go out with Vince. Enjoy your night.”
“I might,” Deb said. “Call me after, okay?”
“Okay, sister girl.”
“I love you,” Deb said. “You’re my best friend.”
“Love you too,” Julia said.
The Encounter
Butchy lay on his bed, staring at the ceiling, waiting for answers. None came. His mind raced, stuck in a loop.
Dinner was lasagna and meatballs, his favorite. A quiet sendoff. His mom hugged him tight in the kitchen, holding on. She had a double shift at the hospital—her way of coping.
She couldn’t face his morning departure. Too much unsaid. They said goodbyes early. She made him promise to call from his dorm. He did. They hugged again. She left.
The house went silent, heavy.
The doorbell cut through. Butchy sat up slow, went downstairs. Deb stood at the door, platform shoes making her almost his height.
She got to the point. “What’s going on with you and my friend?”
Butchy sighed. “It’s complicated, Deb. Everything’s changing. My head’s spinning. I’ve never felt this way. Like I’m not in control.”
“Not in control?” Deb crossed her arms. “Of what?”
He looked past her, into the dark. “The consequences. What my choices might cost.”
Deb’s eyes narrowed, voice sharp. “Let’s stop dancing around it. You’re planning to break up with Julia tomorrow before L.A. You want out of Huntington, your big moment, independence—Mr. Adult. But you know the cost. Julia. The best thing that ever happened to you. And that’s scaring you.”
Butchy didn’t argue. “Yeah. That’s what’s freaking me out.”
Deb eased up. “I’m not here to fight for Julia or push you. That’s your call. But act like the adult you wanna be. Fish or cut bait. Stop stringing her along. Settle it tomorrow, ‘cause this is killing her.”
She stepped back. “I’m meeting Vince. See you at the airport.”
Butchy nodded. “You’re a good friend, Deb. Thanks.”
She hugged him quick. “I have faith in you. You’ll do the right thing.”
She left. The silence returned, heavier, waiting for his choice.
The Talk
Sunday morning, 7:30 a.m. Butchy hit the high school track, earphones in, sneakers pounding. His last jog before L.A. The track was his safe spot—where he thought, breathed, escaped. Today, it felt heavy, like it knew what was coming.
Vince and Deb’s words echoed: Fish or cut bait.
He finished his lap, sweat soaking his shirt, pulse louder than the music. His eyes drifted to the bleachers.
Julia. Her usual spot. Like always.
She sat cross-legged, doodling in her sketchbook, her art her own escape. She looked up as he stopped.
They met halfway, a few feet apart.
“Hey,” they said together, nervous, overlapping.
Julia spoke first. “You needed to think last night. So… where are we? I need to know.”
Butchy met her blue eyes, the ones he’d loved since freshman year. His chest tightened, not from running. He thought he could let her go. Now? He wasn’t sure.
“Long-distance might not work,” he said, voice low. “Opposite coasts. Heavy classes. New people. New adventures. L.A. and Miami are like different planets. We owe ourselves to live it. All of it.”
Julia didn’t flinch or cry. She looked strong, not like the drive-in’s heartbreak.
“I’ve been thinking,” she said. “Maybe I was wrong about long-distance. I could’ve stayed local, gone to Hofstra like Vince and Deb. But I chose Miami. The art program’s great, but the beaches, the life—that pulled me too. I thought we could stay the same. We can’t.”
Butchy sighed, half relief, half regret. Not what he expected, but maybe what they needed.
“Never thought it’d go like this,” he said. “But we’re on the same page.”
A quiet settled. A dog barked far off. A breeze flipped a page in Julia’s sketchbook.
She stepped closer, voice steady. “We’ve been through so much. Going our own way doesn’t mean I stop loving you.”
Butchy swallowed hard. “I love you too, Julia. I don’t know how long-distance’ll go. But I don’t want us to end.”
She took his hand, warm, steady.
“Then we try.”
The Ride
Mack pulled up in his 1972 Chevy Nova, the engine rumbling low. Butchy stood out front, duffel bag at his feet, ready but holding back a little.
He tossed the bag in the backseat and slid into the passenger seat.
“I can’t believe it’s here,” Mack said, eyes on the road. “Felt like this day would never come. Now it’s just… here.”
“Yeah,” Butchy said, settling in. “Been a wild couple of days, to say the least.”
Mack glanced over, keeping it light. “So… you work things out with Jules?”
Butchy nodded slow. “Yeah. We’re gonna do our own thing at college. Live it up. But we’re trying long-distance. Been through too much to just let it go.”
Mack smiled, glad. “That’s a big call, man. I’m happy for you two. Always been something real there.”
Mack flipped the radio on. Chuck Mangione’s Feels So Good drifted out, jazzy and warm, like it knew the moment.
Butchy stared out the windshield, calm, satisfied, like he’d made it through a storm and found peace.
Mack let the quiet hang, then glanced again. “Hey, let me ask you something. You were gone a long time yesterday just changing a washer at Mrs. Banks’ place. What really went down?”
Butchy turned, a slow, cat-like grin spreading. He looked back at the windshield, saying nothing.
Mack laughed, shaking his head. “Never cease to amaze me. Still the boy wonder.”",1,1745769635.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Disclaimer : Taste is subjective, so ano man ang masarap  sa akin doesn’t necessarily mean na masarap din sa yo. 

1. Strawberry (?) and Bugnay (?) Ice Cream -UC
- First of all, big kudos to these students. Bata palang  sila and we can see their potential sa mga ginawa nilang dishes however we are not a fan of the texture ngay. Kasla muteg baka ada jay lang usar da nga stabiliser. 
2. Sisig Pandesal Taco of UC - Masarap, well seasoned ang sisig however, masyado matigas ang pandesal but maybe better siya if it’s flatter or to have it likened sa tacos para hindi gaano makapal . 

3. Jampiling of Pasil from Kalinga - Sarap nito. It’s made out of Kalabasa with Glutenous rice. If i can describe it na kapareho niya, it’s the Tinudok. Nag take out pa ako nito.

4. Kiniing Ice Cream  of Health 101- Surprisingly good. If you’re a fan of sweet and savory, this ones 4 u. Sana ganito rin ang texture nung sa ice cream ng UC.

5.  Abra Miki of Abra - Our first proper meal haha. Well balanced naman ang soup. Nalalasaan lahat. Noodles are bouncy and not overcooked. 

6. Sayote Muffins of Mt. Data - Bit too sweet . Was hoping to taste more of the sayote. Idk why I thought na gagamit sila made out of sayote tops.

7. Kiniing Siomai (forgot the name but it’s next to mt. Data) - this one bit too seasoned naman . The flavour profile of the kiniing is there . Just needs to balance out the savoriness of it. 

8. Cordibap of Venus Hotel - Pretty good. 

9. Kiniing Takoyaki (forgot the name) - Again the flavour profile is there pero matigas ang flour mixture niya and mas madami kaysa sa sahog niya

10. Bugnay Horchata  of Venus Hotel- a great take on the Mexican Drink but i think this needs more push on the flavour profile. May parang  lasang tapey siya.

11. 50 peso bottomless Mojito of Soto Grande - Basically a steal. Wala masyado alcohol pero i dont mind since masarap naman . 

12. FREE CAKES from Sinner or Saint - not sure if meron pa nito bukas pero this was presented after nung coffee making demo nila. Not a fan of sweets that much pero masarap yung strawberry ube cake nila

13. Pata Tim Rolls of Venus Hotel - great plating ngem nagrigat sika nga kanen. It’s good but comparing their Cordibap, mas gusto ko yun.

The buzz about its compact size and versatility had piqued my interest, especially as I’m someone who values a quick cup during hectic mornings. The Horavie KC201, with its sleek black finish and modern design, appeared promising for small kitchens or office spaces needing an efficient coffee companion.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing I noticed when unboxing the Horavie KC201 was its lightweight nature. Weighing just 2.2 pounds, it’s almost effortless to move around. The compact dimensions (7.85"" x 4.33"" x 9.45"") mean it doesn’t occupy much counter space, a blessing in my already crowded kitchen. I admired the modern matte and metallic finish—it feels sophisticated without being flashy. Durability-wise, it’s built from BPA-free, heat-resistant materials, reinforcing safety and long-term usability. The water tank, equipped with a view window, is a useful touch, allowing me to keep an eye on the water level without any fuss.

**Performance**

The one-touch brewing feature might be its biggest trump card. With just a quick press of a button, a steaming cup of coffee was ready in under two minutes (120 seconds, to be exact). Testing this on groggy mornings made me appreciate the speed even more—there’s something magical about caffeine hitting you before the clock ticks further. Its brewing capacity ranges from 6 to 12 ounces, accommodating k-pods or ground coffee seamlessly. Switching between the two options couldn't be more intuitive—simply select your preferred input using the included adapters for pods and grounds.

**Advantages**

- One-touch brewing makes operation quick and easy, even during rushed mornings.
- Compact size and portability are perfect for small kitchens, dorm rooms, or RV setups.  
- Supports k-pods and ground coffee, offering flexibility for users who like to switch between the two.  
- Descaling reminder and self-cleaning feature ensure top-notch maintenance with minimal effort.

**Ease of Use and Cleaning**

This machine stands out for being beginner-friendly. Even my younger cousin who’s not particularly tech-savvy managed to brew her perfect cup on a visit. The addition of a self-cleaning mode is a lifesaver—I activated it by holding two buttons for a couple of seconds while using a descaling solution, and the machine did the hard work itself. A red indicator lights up when it’s time for descaling, further reducing maintenance guesswork.

**Downsides**

Though the Horavie KC201 has a lot going for it, perfection is elusive.  
- Brewing for multiple people or gatherings can be inconvenient with its single-serve design.  
- The device can be slightly loud during the brewing process.  
- Limited high-end customization features if you’re looking for a more sophisticated coffee experience.  

**Safety and Longevity**

The coffee maker scores high on safety. It automatically shuts off after brews, which was reassuring when I tested it during chaotic mornings and accidentally forgot to turn it off. Overheating concerns were also nonexistent, even after using it for multiple cups back-to-back. The durable, heat-resistant materials reinforced my confidence in its lifespan, as does its intelligent maintenance with the descaling functionality.

**Other Options**

Comparing the Horavie KC201 to some peers brought interesting observations. Against Keurig’s Slim Series single-serve brewer, this one holds its ground with portability and affordability. Keurig offers larger water reservoirs, making it better for frequent coffee drinkers, but I prefer Horavie’s more compact design for limited spaces. Generic capsule machines in this category often forego self-cleaning features, which gives this coffee maker a clear edge.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

While exact pricing can fluctuate, the machine undeniably offers excellent features for its cost. Durability combined with flexibility (pod or ground coffee options) and maintenance-friendly settings make it worth the investment. I don’t think I’d find similar functionality offered at this level in most competing models.

I’m 27 (F) and recently had my first baby with my husband (our son is my parents first grandchild). 

Growing up, my parents were always quite strict, my mum was a little controlling and VERY overbearing. Some was usual parenting things such as, not allowed to leave the house on certain days/times, controlling my appearance etc and this continued into adulthood. For aslong as I’ve been alive, mum has always given/done everything she can to everyone she cares for but it was excessive and we often found it rude, especially when I became an adult. For example, she would clean my house without me asking or being there, buy things without me asking and later use these acts of service as black mail. Whilst away on our honeymoon, mum cleaned my entire house, put new air fresheners in every room, put a new coffee table in our living room and replaced the glass in our French doors. Whilst we appreciated it, we found it frustrating and rude. 

I have a thousand stories of my mum trying to control other aspects of my life after I moved out including my wedding, my job, my house etc. during arguements, mum will often refer to things she has done for me as a form of black mail and guilt trip me eg. Contributed financially to our wedding, gave furniture, money etc. Fast forward to November 2023, I found out I was expecting our first child together. 

Due to a previous miscarriage when I was 21, we weren’t keen on telling anyone the news until I was 12 weeks pregnant however decided to tell our parents and asked that this was kept a secret from EVERYONE. Christmas Day comes and I’m 10 weeks pregnant in the local pub. My mum decides to start telling the pub locals that I’m pregnant. I reminded her that this is a secret and we didn’t want anyone to know because we didnt want to tell everyone that I had another miscarriage. She played this down by repeatedly saying “it’s fine, everything is going to be fine, nothing bad is going to happen!”. 

Toward the end of my pregnancy, I began showing signs of pre eclampsia and was being closely monitored. Understandably, this made my mum very worried and anxious but to very extreme levels. She began demanding to attend my appointments with me (despite my husband coming to every appointment) as she wanted to know every single detail of my care. She called me constantly and often turned up at my door if she couldn’t get ahold of me. I wouldn’t allow her to come to my appointments as I wanted my husband there and you’re only allowed 1 person to accompany you. This caused frequent arguments. Her high levels of worry/anxiety really stressed me out, so I stopped sharing information with her about my pregnancy. On multiple occasions, I was admitted to hospital for observations and I wouldn’t tell her because I couldn’t cope with her behaviours. 

(This part is important for later) The decision was made for an induction to be booked as my blood pressure was not being managed with medication. I was induced at 5pm, spoke to my mum on the phone at 8pm when my husband went home - told her nothing is happening yet (no contractions) and I was going to sleep soon. My water broke at 10pm, told my husband but told him to get some sleep and I’ll call him when I go to the labour ward. 3am, I’m moved to the labour ward and I call my husband to come to the hospital. As soon as I arrived on the labour ward, the contractions kicked in strong and fast. My son was born at 6:30am, and during those 3.5 hours multiple events occurred resulting in a traumatic birth. Baby was born fine and healthy, after skin to skin with baby and an hour of being sewn back together, we finally settled down and checked our phones. We had multiple missed calls and texts from my mum asking for an update. My husband replied to my mum saying everyone is fine and will update her soon. 

Fast forward to December 2024 - our son is 5 months old. My mum frequently gave unsolicited parenting advice, she told us on a daily basis her opinion that we should start weaning our baby onto solids. Every time we told her we’re following NHS guidelines and choosing not to start weaning until he is 6 months old. I told my mum our plans to give our baby some solid food on Christmas Day (this way everyone can be there to witness this milestone). The following day during a phone call (my parents were on a short break away), my mum admitted to me that she had already fed my son food when looking after him when he was 4 months old. I kept my cool, told her that this wasn’t cool at all. She didn’t acknowledge her mistake, didn’t apologise and told me not to tell my husband. The call ended and she immediately texted me to tell me I was over reacting and I “ruined their weekend away”. I asked for some space. A few days later, she created a group chat with my family and named the group “space” and cancelled christmas, blaming me and my husband. To this day, my mum still has acknowledged or apologised for her behaviour, and actually expects an apology from me for “withholding her grandson from her”. 

Everything was swept under the rug when my dad begged us to come to their house on Christmas Day. I was filled with guilt over the thought that my parents wouldn’t see on my son on his first Christmas, so I agreed to go. 

Fast forward to now, my relationship with my mum is fragile but ok. I’m still anxious about my mum looking after my son - I know she would never intentionally harm him, however I’m worried that an accident will happen as she doesn’t listen to me or follow my “parenting rules”. I just want my son to be looked after the same as I do. For example, no blankets, toys etc in his cot, don’t serve certain foods, basic baby safety stuff. I’ve tried to create a bit of distance between us however she just won’t allow it to happen as all she cares about is seeing my son. 

This week during a couple of drinks at the pub, my mum started explaining how upset she was that she wasn’t at the birth of my son. Despite not wanting her at the birth due to her behaviours during my pregnancy, I tried to be nice and explain that only one person is allowed to be at the birth so she wouldn’t have been allowed anyway. She said “those midwives would’ve let me be there aswell if you really pushed them and insisted I was there!”  

She continued explaining how disappointed she was that she wasn’t updated or kept in the loop during my labour. I calmly explained that it was early hours of the morning, a very stressful situation and we didn’t think to contact her. She began slagging my husband off, saying that he should’ve contacted her to let her know I was in labour. No matter how much I explained, she wouldn’t listen or understand and the situation escalated. She accused us of actively deciding to not update her, being on our phones and ignoring her messages and even said that I should’ve reminded my husband to keep her updated despite being in labour! I eventually flipped and told her that whilst being in labour, she is neither mine or my husbands priority and my labour has nothing to do with her. I told her I understand that she was worried about me but she’s not entitled to know every aspect of my life. She was also shouting at my dad, because he was in agreement with me. 

5 days go by, I’ve heard nothing from my parents. I’m stressing because it’s my first week back at work from maternity leave and my mum has my son one day a week (Fridays). My dad calls me and tells me to “sort it out” with my mum. I said why should I? My mum never acknowledges or apologises, so in other words I have to just accept it and move on (similar to Christmas). I text my mum getting straight to the point and asked her if she was going to apologise and get no response. My dad calls again and saying is that all you’ve got to say to your mum?! He starts shouting at me over the phone and tells me he suggests I make alternative childcare arrangements, I responded that’s fine. He then said “you know what, you’ll miss us!”

My mum texts me telling me to bring my son to her house on Friday despite being told by my dad to make alternative childcare. I told her no, she accuses me of “using her grandson as a bargaining tool to punish her”. 

For context - whilst this is happening, we find out that we are moving into our new house with 1 week notice so we begin frantically packing our house up. My mum sends a text to myself, husband and dad demanding that we meet face to face. My husband says no because we’re too busy (packing) and she responds with “if you want to continue having a relationship with me and *dad* I suggest you make time!” 

I would really appreciate an outsiders perspective, I’m at my limit and I don’t have the time or energy to deal with my parents behaviours now that I have a family of my own. So far my mum has ruined my experience of pregnancy, childbirth, my son’s first Christmas and my first week back at work from maternity leave. I am constantly thinking, what important time is she going to ruin next? We’ve been thinking that if nothing changes, we will have to cut my parents out of our lives. Am I over reacting?

1k9769t,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeGearReviews/comments/1k9769t/explore_if_the_ajvv_tt13_portable_air_conditioner/,Explore if the AJVV TT-13 portable air conditioner review meets your needs!,"Testing out the AJVV TT-13 Portable Air Conditioner has been a journey worth sharing. This compact yet versatile device, with a modern build and multifunctionality, grabbed my attention the moment I unboxed it. Designed with the needs of small spaces and portability in mind, it’s clear that a lot of thought went into balancing practicality with usability. With its capacity to cool, humidify, and even act as a nightlight, I committed several consecutive days to thoroughly testing its features at home, in the office, and even during a quick camping trip.

**Compact Design and Convenience**

Portability is the name of the game for the AJVV TT-13. With dimensions of 7.87"" x 5.11"" x 10.62"" and a weight of just under two pounds, it’s easy to carry and place almost anywhere. I effortlessly moved it between my desk, bedroom, and even outdoors during a coffee-on-the-balcony session. The white aesthetic pairs well with most decors, and cleaning the unit is fairly straightforward thanks to the included cleaning brush. Its USB-powered design allowed me to plug it into my laptop while working or use a power bank while outside—a huge bonus for flexibility.

**3 Cooling Speeds with Adjustable Airflow**

One feature that stood out is the device’s adjustable speeds with three different settings: low, medium, and high. On particularly hot days, I found the high setting to be very effective at creating a refreshing breeze. The added misting humidification system truly elevates its cooling capabilities. With a little water in its built-in 1250ml reservoir, the air this fan produces has a noticeably more comfortable feel. I even tested adjusting the air outlet to its 60-degree range, which helped target specific areas like my reading corner or the kids’ play area.

**7 Colors of Ambient Night Lighting**

I didn’t expect to appreciate the LED nightlight feature as much as I did. It cycles through seven soothing colors, which can also be set to your favorite one. Initially, I used this as a simple bedside lamp, which helped me wind down at night, but it showed its charm further when I brought it to a family gathering. Sitting on the table during conversation-filled evenings, the light added a comforting atmosphere as a party accent—unexpected but delightful!

**Strengths of the AJVV TT-13**

- The lightweight, ultra-portable design makes it perfect for small spaces and on-the-go usage.  
- Its adjustable air outlet and multiple speed settings provide versatility for different environments.  
- The addition of a large water tank ensures up to nine hours of cooling and humidifying, minimizing the need for constant refills.  

**Areas of Concern**

- While the cooling effect is pleasant, it is not a substitute for a high-powered air conditioner, especially for very large spaces.  
- Maintaining the water level in the reservoir can be cumbersome without frequent monitoring of the water level window, especially in humid climates.  

**Alternative Offerings**

There are several portable air coolers on the market that compete with this product. For instance, some units in higher price brackets feature dual fan systems and more robust power. However, these are often bulkier and are nowhere near as compact or lightweight as the AJVV TT-13. Compared to others at its price range, this product excels in multi-functionality with its humidifier and nightlight integration. Devices like the Arctic Air Pure Chill, for example, might offer slightly quieter performance but lack the nightlight or the same large water capacity.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

For what it offers, the price feels reasonable—neither excessively cheap nor shockingly pricey. It hits that sweet spot where it feels like you're getting more than you originally bargained for. Many similar products cut corners by forgoing features like multiple cooling speeds or USB powering capabilities, but this portable air conditioner keeps them intact. Its long-lasting water tank capacity also surprised me; it’s rare for small devices like this to go up to nine hours without needing a refill, ensuring that the investment feels justified for personal cooling needs.

So I ordered Vietnamese iced coffee from a cafe, which I prefer because of the condensed milk taste in the coffee. However, the Instagrammable cafe in Saibaba colony charged ₹250 and completely watered down on coffee, and I didn't get any flavour of condensed milk from the beginning. But we somehow drink a few sips, and then the ice melts, making it bitter water. I asked the service person if he could give sugar packets (like ccd ones) or maybe add condensed milk. Meanwhile we were in a rush to leave that guy told they were making us a new coffee to which we insisted that it was ok and we were in rush. Then we met the barista at the billing counter and after paying bill we were about to leave but he asked what was wrong with the coffee then I politely explained all the above. I even said I didn't say it as his fault. But all I really felt was resentment.

Other people have mentioned here similar requests but as of April 2025 the feature still does not exist in the Starbucks mobile app.

The Starbucks app is generally pretty well designed and what I propose is a tiny improvement to it, in keeping with the streamlined nature of the app, at present.

I would like to (optionally) receive email copies of all purchases I make through my Starbucks account to the email address associated with that account. Sending receipts, to an email address that Starbucks already has, is trivial from a technical perspective. If Home Depot can do it, I would think that Starbucks could do it. FWIW, I am a software developer, so I know how easy this is unless the Starbucks infrastructure is really goofed up (doubtful).

I also suggest that adding a simple yes/no checkbox to the Settings portion of the app, to enable or disable this send-all-receipts-to-email feature, would be easy for users to understand.

Business travelers, such as myself, would save considerable time (relative to scanning paper receipts or manually generating emailed receipts through interactions with the Starbucks app), and would therefore have a more frictionless experience ordering through Starbucks (which should be a key goal for Starbucks).

Is someone (i.e., Starbucks employee) on this subreddit able to roll this into a Starbucks feature request?

If not, what can I do to submit this feature request to the right place?

Potentially grouchy qualifications to my request:

Please don't recommend that I display the receipt and then screenshot what is displayed and then type in an email address and email title to an email of the screenshot that I send to myself. If I wanted to do things in unnecessarily hard ways, I would make my own coffee, but here we are

Please also don't recommend that I click the ""share"" button when displaying the receipt within the app because that only shares the drink details (e.g., vente latte with customizations) that I ordered not the financial details of what I bought",1,1745768863.0,starbucks,1,1.0,False

Is breakfast in your room an added service, or can you choose that everyday? I am not a morning person :/

You know, like buying a Ferrari just to drive to the grocery store once a week. Overkill much?

I decided to create my own solution: ProofWall. Because apparently I'd rather spend 100 hours coding than keep paying that $19 monthly fee. My wife thinks I'm insane, but hey, at least I own it now!

The problem was simple: I needed to collect customer testimonials for my side projects, but all the existing solutions charged a monthly subscription fee while offering features I didn't need. It's like paying for the all-you-can-eat buffet when all you wanted was the mashed potatoes.

So I put on my developer's hat (which is just my regular hat but with more coffee stains and a slight smell of desperation) and created something I would have loved to have.

This tool enables:

* Collect an unlimited number of text testimonials from your customers (yes, UNLIMITED! Even though most of us will only ever get like 12)
* Collect video testimonials with no arbitrary limits (except the limits of how many people actually want to be on camera praising your product)
* A simple, uncluttered interface that doesn't clutter you up (unlike my desk while building this thing)
* No monthly fees - you own it, you use it as much as you like (or as little, no judgment here)

The whole thing is designed to be simple - just create a project, share the link with your customers and start collecting powerful social proof that you can use throughout your marketing. Or just stare at them when you're feeling down and need validation. We've all been there.

I'd love to hear any comments or suggestions from the community! Are there features you'd like to see? Bugs you'd like to point out that'll keep me up at night? I'm all ears!

Has anyone else been frustrated by the limitations of existing testimonial collection tools?

1k96uo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Volkswagen/comments/1k96uo5/terrible_terrible_customer_service/,"Terrible, terrible customer service","November 30, 2024. My wife and I sat at the Santa Rosa Volkswagen dealership signing papers to buy a new Tiguan to accommodate our growing family—our third child, a little girl was born not much more than a month later. We’d made a decision about the car we wanted, we’d researched, we felt good about it. We didn’t even try to haggle, just agreed to everything and bought the car. It was, after all, still on some kind of Black Friday special.

Should’ve taken the day for the ominous portent it was. I’ve always felt nauseated by the consumer bonanza that represents the worst of our culture, the image of greedy people rushing into stores at five am and punching each other out over flat screen TVs. But it was Saturday night, and the dealership was quiet. I’d just hoped our timing corresponded with a period when we might get the car a little cheaper. I’d also read buying at the end of the year was also cheaper.

We must’ve sat in the dealership for five hours and by the time we’d signed everything, our salesperson was surprised we didn’t want to sit in the car and go over all the features, or even test drive beyond the confines of the parking lot. We were tired, my wife was very pregnant, we just wanted to get our car and go.

My wife got in the Toyota, and I followed her in the new Volkswagen Tiguan. I’ve never been very interested in cars, but, I won’t lie, I was happy they’d had one in black available, and, in the shiny new car, I felt kind of luxurious driving away and merging into the stream of Bay Area Saturday evening traffic. Since then, I’ve wondered if I had selected the white one they’d first showed us, if I could’ve avoided the incredible fracas that followed.

Almost exactly two months later, on March fifth, once the kids were asleep, and I was ensconced at the dinner table while my wife nursed the baby and folded clothes at the same, we discussed the text she’d sent me earlier that day.

“Did you try the car?” She asked.

“Yeah,” I responded. “After class I went out in the driveway and tried with my key fob. I didn’t do anything.”

“I can’t imagine what happened to it. Do you think it’s out of gas?”

“No.”

Nothing to be done at 9pm Pacific Time, we went to bed with a nonfunctioning, brand-new car in the driveway, thinking, well, it’ll be fixed soon. Probably just some small electrical issue, which, of course, there’s no such thing.

We woke to Thursday, the first day in which we were back to one car. I took the kids to school before work, my wife stayed at home all day, her parents picked the kids up, and I came home in the evening. Nothing too difficult, we were able to slip back into our one-car routine pretty easily, but hoped it wouldn’t be for long.

Friday, my day off, I began a journey of a thousand miles with a single step by calling the dealership from which I’d bought the car. That’s usually what you do when there’s a problem with something you’ve bought. You call the place where you bought it. I was very casually told that Santa Rosa dealership had nothing to do with this process, and, rather it would Roadside Assistance who take care of the towing, and then the dealership would fix it.

VW Roadside Assistance, like many phone numbers for multinational companies, is outsourced to a phonebank, probably in the Philippines. Whatever management company runs these phone banks has got something very wrong. Rather than focus on understanding the issue and solving it, their focus is on repetition of phrases as though it were this that soothes the consumer, rather than effectively addressing the issue they are calling about. Thus, useless phrases such as “are you safe and out of danger?” were peppered in the conversations I would have with Roadside Assistance for the next week. I must’ve been asked to confirm my phone number alone probably 30 times. When one is simply trying to make someone understand their situation, especially a situation which was already deemed “solved” by the previous operator, but is nowhere near “solved”, is frustrating to say the least, and on top of that to be forever spelling one’s last name, looking for the vin number, and listening to someone painstakingly repeating your phone number back to your digit-by-digit just to get the same answer makes it difficult not to raise one’s voice, and yet, obviously it is not the fault of the individual on the phone that the problem has not been solved. They are paid to repeat, and push certain buttons, there’s no sense in getting upset with them, but who then is there to be upset with?

This has been my central question for months now.

I could not arrange a tow that Friday. I spent the whole morning on a back and forth between dealership and roadside assistance. I was told my case would be saved only to call back and be told that there was no record of the forty minutes I’d just spent on the phone.

The dealership where we’d bought the car, was just outside the towing range, thankfully, there was a dealership just within the range, being over the mountains, it was the same length of driving time, but Roadside Assistance insisted it had to go there to Medford, Oregon. When I’d finally got all the details worked out, it was early in the afternoon on a Friday. They called me a few times to tell me that they still hadn’t found someone to tow the car. Each time they called, they did the whole “are you safe and out of danger?” and “let me confirm your phone number” rigamarole. Eventually they told me that, it being Friday, they were unlikely to find anything, and would have to start again on Monday.

In the meantime, I would have to rent a car, I made a few calls about this, but hit a wall every time. Roadside assistance had no connection with reimbursement for that. Maybe our insurance would pay for it? No, because we didn’t have a claim with them. Perhaps the dealership? No, because they didn’t participate in the loaner car program. So, I rented a car and paid for it myself, thinking, I could eventually be reimbursed for it.

Monday morning, Roadside Assistance had told me they would start searching at 8am, instead, they called me at 5am. Being half-asleep, I didn’t answer the phone, so I had to call them when I got up an hour later and let them know that, yes, from my six am Monday morning kitchen, I was safe and out of danger. And yes, please resume looking for a tow for the car.

Over the course of Monday and Tuesday, they called me about 12 times. Each time, asking me if I was safe and out of danger. By Tuesday, I really began to hate the redundancy of that phrase. I longed to point out to someone who would care that “safe” implied “out of danger”. I wondered how much of the world’s time had been wasted by the addition of those extra three words that had probably been crafted in haste by some director who never thought about how stupid it was, never having had to confront the question for three days. I took to answering the phone by saying “I’m safe and out of danger”. And every time, Roadside assistance would pause, too long, and then repeat to me “Thank you, Jonathan for confirming you are safe and out of danger, now could you please confirm your contact number for me”. Not only did they repeat the message I had just tried to avoid going through, but now they needed to tell me the number that they had just dialed. In speaking with someone so clearly scripted, especially when nothing is being accomplished and the message is always the same, one begins to wonder if indeed, these are functional human beings and not AI programs designed only give the impression that an issue is being considered.

In the meantime, the dealership had begun calling me. They were very helpful, daily checking in about the status of the tow. This wasn’t the same dealership from which I had bought the car, so I was glad to find that they seemed more willing to jump in and help us get the car repaired. Plus, they contacted me, and, spoke plainly, directly, never asking redundant questions.

It took a week, but eventually a small towing company based about an hour south of us (the opposite direction of the dealership) agreed to take the tow after I asked to escalate the case after a week of inaction and an insane amount of repetition and useless phone calls coming in while I was at work. It felt like such a victory that my wife sent me a video of the Tiguan being towed out of the driveway. Now, it seemed, it would be whisked to the dealership, repaired and our problems would be over. Oh how naïve, how incredibly naïve to believe that.

…

Nearly a month later, I’m driving through the snow after leaving a moderately pleasant day on the coast. The forecast hadn’t called for any snow, but up on the pass between the Oregon/California border the weather is mercurial. The drive is beautifully varied, and in truth I didn’t mind having an opportunity to take the scenery in, and have a little time to myself. There are multiple places north of my home where 101 opens on beautiful, wild, churning ocean views. Even through the haze of rain, these are compelling, and provided a much needed justification for living at the edge of the world where there are no Volkswagen dealerships. Beyond the booming efforts of the ocean working at the rocky northern coast, a befogged redwood forest staggers along the strangely turquoise Smith River; each switchback through the forest reveals another primordial tree trunk, so vast they push the same feeling of insignificance on the viewer that the night sky so often gets credit for. The forest retreats and the crags push out over the river and the burn scars settle over the summits in blackened tangles alongside the road, and precariously dripping hollows of rocks and mud. The entire landscape looks set to drop into the frothing river, which pushes hard against its banks as if wanting to hasten the process and then you are forced out of the valley to climb up to the tunnel at the border. One of those tunnels which connects two different climates, but today, it’s snowy rain and gray skies on either side.

The landscape is so tortuous and severe that it is calming when seen from a windshield. The lazy driver can’t help but to imagine slogging over the great muddy peaks, soaked through with rain and fog, trundling through the foggy masses of sword ferns, the ground sucking at one’s boots, or sending strange-angled rocks to resist the advances of their tread while the rain-snow chills the extremities and soaks the clothes until everything chafes. What would be an exhausting hike, is an easy, if not hypnotic drive. The landscape is too bold to be conquered by road and car and reminds the modern traveler, at every turn, what they should be enduring to traverse it.

I may have also been feeling cowed by the landscape because I’d barely been able to obtain a car to cross it. After weeks of testing, calling, uncertainty, waiting, and trying to find any reimbursement for a rental—which never came through—the Tiguan was given a new instrument cluster which, we were told, had fixed the problem. Now the issue was that there was no way to simply get the car back now that it was operational. No one would tow a working car. Neither the dealership, nor VW Customer Care would take responsibility for reuniting the car with the owner. My only recourse was to rent a car and pay the $150 one-way fee when you take a rental car out of the fleet.

Only, because the area is so remote, this is not even an option with the rental company. I found this out after booking a car the only way I could which was to note that I would be returning it to the same location and, surprise them with the information that I would, instead, be returning it to Medford, Oregon.

Luckily, I know the people at the rental car company, having taken many cars for work over the last couple of years. And it was only through this connection that they agreed to let me return the car to Oregon and knock off half of the one-way fee.

So, I drove to dealership thinking over the entire course of the drive that I would not be able to repeat the ease of picking up the car this way and, should there ever be another issue, I would have to rent a mini-van and have the whole family along for the eight-hour round trip, ten if you factor in stops. Meanwhile, the landscape rose darkly around me and began to roil with tufts of dim, wet mountain snow.

At the dealership, I hadn’t expected any kind of reception, but was still surprised to discover the indifference of the staff at my arrival. Hadn’t I been the one calling regularly for the past few weeks? Was I not the same customer who had been texting for an entire week just about the tow? Hadn’t I called, pleaded for a way to get the gar back after the issue had been repaired? Were they not sick of my issue? Did they not feel a sense of relief to have this case now off their hands? Did they not appreciate the four-hour drive I had just made simply to get the car?

No. I had to ask for any information. They told me only what they’d already told me. The instrument cluster had been replaced and the issue fixed. Somehow, this fell flat. “Well, what had caused it? Would this continue to be an issue? Did I have any guarantee that any further repairs would be easier?” This was all met with blank looks and mild reassurances. Reassurances which I knew to be noncommittal because they were the same ones I was met with when I went out to start the car and every warning light came on in the instrument panel and the car, not starting, began to roll backwards. It was as bad as it had been in my driveway, perhaps worse. There it simply didn’t do anything. Here it lit up with every imaginable warning and *then* didn’t start.

Luckily, I am not the type to vent my frustration on strangers. I was thankful that my family was not with me while trying to start the car because they would’ve received an earful of imprecation. As I was alone, I just swore under my breath and went off to collect the employee who had just waved me in the direction of the car and hadn’t even bothered to come out with me to make sure the car would start.

“Not starting? Huh.”

Easy for him to say, he hadn’t taken a day off to drive eight hours through the snow to get here. He hadn’t been without a car for a month with three kids, unable to rent a replacement since no one would reimburse for it. Unable to go anywhere together. Having to rearrange car seats every time we used the other car. Spending countless hours on the phone with people entirely indifferent to the situation and eager, yes, *eager*to put them blame on to someone else. Anything so long as they didn’t have to do anything themselves. All of this only to stand here in the rain, find the car not starting and, once again, to be met with indifference.

It was the battery, supposedly. It had been drained in the testing processes. The was a natural occurrence. “Well, yeah,” I began, “but I called and said I was coming to pick the car up, why didn’t anyone check the battery? I have to drive four hours over a mountain pass to get home?” Only I didn’t say this because I knew I would only be met with an indifferent shrug, or a noncommittal response. I just swallowed the feeling that I was, once again, being brushed off as a matter of course.

The Tiguan was charged while I went to drop off the rental. I found it running when I returned. I talked with another person who had been working on it, but he had nothing new to tell me. I talked to him only to put my mind at ease that I hadn’t overlooked anything. I didn’t want to hop in and drive off without exhausting the possibility of anything else going wrong. Unfortunately, I’m not very good at this, I guess.

I turned the car off and on several times before leaving town. Once at the dealership. Once a mile away to get coffee. Again, to get gas, before I satisfied myself that the Tiguan was indeed starting again without issue. The time and date on the instrument cluster had not been set, but at least the car was starting, shifting, conveying me as I paid $600 a month for it to.

It was only when I stopped again, halfway home that I noticed that the other key I had brought would not start the car. The key that had been with the dealership worked, but the key that had been at home while the car had been repaired was not recognized.

“Oh, yeah, that would need to be reset.” The technician told me. Sounding happily apologetic, like, ‘ha ha, guess we managed to mess something else up!’

I couldn’t help it. “if we had caught this before I left, how long would it have taken to reprogram the other key?”

“Oh, fifteen minutes. Maybe half an hour.”

…

I got the Tiguan home that night. Had dinner alone and put the kids to bed. I had spent the entire day on the road to retrieve the car and, predictably, the next morning, after I had gone to work, I received a text from my wife. “The Tiguan,” she wrote, “isn’t starting.”

AAA came out, found no battery or alternator issues, and gave the car a jump which got it started. And, almost miraculously, there were no further issues. We began to return to our normal routine. I started riding my bike to work again and my wife was able to pick the kids up from school and drop them off.

Naively, I began to think that maybe the Tiguan would be alright now. Maybe there had been an issue, but it was now fixed. Maybe I could go back to having a car that could hold my entire family and that worked. I mean, the car was brand new. It was hard to look at it and see a broken-down vehicle. Damn thing practically sparkled with deception.

The only issue was that we had to get the other key reprogrammed. Luckily, we would be going down to the Bay Area for easter and would have to pass by the dealership where we bought the car.

Bizarrely, they refused to fix the key under warrantee claiming that the Medford dealership had created the problem, therefore they wouldn’t fix it without payment—which was about $150 all told.

It took nearly another week of back and forth between dealerships to get Medford to pay Santa Rosa the hundred bucks to fix the damn key. And we had to be on a bit of a time crunch to make it to the dealership by 2pm on the day we headed down as with small children, you never know when you’re going to have to stop. You just can’t keep driving with a crying baby in the back, and my daughter, who usually gets a bit of car sickness, barfed and we had to pull over and get her cleaned up.

I dropped my family and the luggage off at the hotel and raced over to Santa Rosa Hansel Volkswagen arriving almost right at 2pm. This was the first time I had returned to the dealership since I’d bought the car that had given me so many issues. This is where I’d had to sit for hours while I’d signed all the paperwork that cemented my relationship to this fraught machine which no one was willing to take responsibility for. By rights, this is where I should have had my issue resolved, but through multiple acts of corporate legerdemain, the people walking around here had no reason to feel any responsibility to me and my issue.

Still, I couldn’t help but to feel a little irritable when the service manager began our conversation by telling me “we don’t normally book appointments that late in the day.”

“I live 200 miles away from here.” Was all I could manage, though I very much wanted to tell him that I had bought the vehicle here which had developed one issue after another and that I would much rather have no appointment at all, given that I’d bought the thing only four months earlier brand new. But what would be the use? He would just stare at my blankly, and I would have future opportunities to rant anyway. I just didn’t know it yet.

When they brought the Tiguan out. I made sure to turn it off and on several times. I took one key and placed it a few yards out and repeated the process with the other. I didn’t expect that anything should work as a matter of course and I dearly wanted to make sure I didn’t leave anything undone or unaddressed that resulted from this visit until we were back home, without recourse to fix it.

I went back to the hotel, we swam, went out to eat, took a walk around town, and later, when everyone was asleep, and I was feeling hungry, I even took the car out to grab a burrito. It was nice to have both keys working.

Before I went back up the room, I waited for the automatic headlights to turn off. I scrutinized the vehicle to make sure nothing was still on by mistake—we woken up to a dead car enough times now to make me paranoid, even though, by this time, we’d nearly reached two weeks without an issue, other than the key debacle.

But of course, in the early morning, when I went out to get coffee, the Tiguan was dead. I walked off to get coffee, fuming, trying to think of plan, while my wife called AAA.

I talked to the tow truck driver while my mind continued to race over possibilities. It was Saturday, but did I have some kind of recourse while I was here in the town where I’d bought the vehicle? Couldn’t I find a way to dump the thing off at the dealership, make them give me a loaner and, thus, put the burden of repair on them for a change? It was worth a shot.

I let the car run after the jump—not even sure it did any good—and waited for the dealership to open at 9.

I got there a few minutes early, but there were plenty of people around and as I walked up, someone came out, a young woman, almost eager, like happy to see me, I explained the situation, not even sure, at this point, how far back I should start, she listened with concern on her face and said “let’s see if we can’t do something to make your day a little better” and for a moment, I thought maybe this is all I had to do, just show up in person, visibly frustrated, at the place where I’d bought the car. Another employee, presumably of a higher rank came out and I had too begin the story again, but growing in the faith that the telling of it might do some good, I launched in with gusto, but as I sputtered over the final details, I began to hear the “I’m sorry, sir” tone, and he started in on a mantra that he was only a salesman, could only sell cars, couldn’t help me at all; the service department was closed.

Then why the hell make me explain all of that twice? Did you think I was here this early and in this state because I wanted to buy a car?! Think I got myself all worked up at 8:45am on a Saturday to come in here and buy?!

To make matters worse, when I asked simply if he knew any other dealership where the service department would be open on Saturday—I once again naively assumed he had *some* kind of connection to the web of local dealerships—he began scrolling on his phone and after a long time reported that, no, it’s policy that service departments are closed on Saturday. When I realized he was only googling it. I joined him, no longer trusting him with even this simple task; he was the kind of person announces even the things of which he is the most ignorant with a mark of authority and knowledge. This was proven true when in a few seconds I located the Hayward dealership with a service department open on Saturday.

I’d left the Tiguan running throughout the conversation, so, fortunately, I had no issues leaving behind the scene of such apathy and lack of consideration.

You take any other product, excepting perhaps a house, and the protocol is that when the product is brand new and not working, you are able to return it to the place where you bought it. In some cases, they need a receipt, in some cases they will only trade you for another product, but I can’t think of another instance where they do absolutely nothing, but tell you to call a number, where they do absolutely nothing, and make you figure out how the process of even doing a return works through your own investigation, only to tell you that you have to wait 30 days while they consider it, and once an answer sent, there is no way of appeal, no way of responding, and no way of even confirming on what knowledge the answer was based given that you have no way of peering behind the curtain of the obfuscated process.

After calling Volkswagen Customer Care several times, and being told point blank that “they didn’t do that” when asking for a channel for reimbursement for rental cars used while the Tiguan was in the shop for three weeks, and, when the dealership refused to reunite me with the vehicle—ie. send it back to me—the fee to do a one-way car rental to pick it up, to say nothing of all the inconvenience of being without a vehicle, all the time spent on the phone, etc. We were told to get the company to move on anything we had to start a Buyback claim, which we did while the Tiguan was in the shop in Medford. Given that the vehicle was brand new and already had to be in the shop so long and have such a major fix, it seemed obvious that any consumer would be within rights to say, “hey, this thing’s still under warranty, it’s clearly got a substantial problem, at the very least, offer to replace it.” But no, after receiving an email which asked me to submit documents, but being told I didn’t need to submit anything by the person I was speaking to on the phone and getting useless updates from, we waited out our thirty days only to receive an email that very simply said, “no, we have no offer for you—the shit car is yours and there’s nothing you can do to make use do anything other than keep bringing it back for repairs. Guess maybe you should’ve picked the white one instead of the black one.”

We got this email when we’d returned from our disastrous trip to the Bay Area. I had thought with getting the key replaced, we were possibly fixing the last remaining problem from the initial issue with the Tiguan, but no. We were only on the road to discovering how deeply flawed the vehicle was.

I had called the Hayward dealership that Saturday, but when I asked for a loaner, I was told nothing was available, and that they wouldn’t be able to take the car that day. Rocky was sympathetic, but, like so many along this tortuous journey, completely unable to help, and unable to offer any other means of finding help.

Of course, the next day—Sunday—the Tiguan was dead again. I was all for another jump and driving it back home after Easter, but my wife vetoed that. We have to drive through a lot of mountainous, remote country to get back home, if something should happen with a two-month-old, three-year-old, and a six-year-old, we’d have our work cut out for us and we already knew from experience how unhelpful everyone who was supposed to help was. I could just imagine being stranded in Garberville, California for days while roadside assistance called every few hours to inform me that, no, no tow had been found and that, no they couldn’t help me with a rental to get out of there, but that I was welcome to pay for one myself—that last one they always offered like they had hit upon a great idea: “hey, I know, *you* can pay for it!”

So, I decided to miss a day of work so we could take the Tiguan in Monday morning. We called AAA about 6:00am, they jumped the car, I took it over about 7:00 and was told it was likely the battery, that even though AAA checked the battery, they didn’t have the same way of checking that Volkswagen did. But, in the end, the service manager Robert told me that the battery was fine and the only thing he could think was that it was only charging to like 9.5 volts when it should be charging to 12. He said he’d fixed that and it should take care of the problem. Of course, after our six-hour drive home later that day, the next morning the Tiguan was predictably dead. The kids who’d already missed a day of school would have to miss another.

It was at this time that I received the email with no explanation, marked “NO REPLY” which denied us a buy back. A sneer was almost discernable behind the noncommittal corporate boilerplate form, or perhaps at this point, I was really starting to get upset.

The tendency, or should I say the trick, is for the corporate Customer Care to try to put the onus on the dealership. They try to get you to throw the dealership under the bus, as if it’s the dealership to which you only took the car to fix a preexisting condition which is somehow to blame for this condition. Or as if these hardworking, ordinary people are somehow to blame for the car that I bought at another dealership. I haven’t had great service from any of the dealerships I’ve had to discuss this issue with. Santa Rosa is the worst offender simply because I bought the car there and they’ve never offered any kind of help, but of course, the first step is to get the car towed from Roadside Assistance when it’s not working, so, yeah, what can they offer, from the beginning, they have to instruct you to call someone else, someone not even in this country to begin getting the problem fixed.

I had the issue with the Medford dealership of going to pick up the Tiguan and finding the battery drained which meant that even though I called to tell them I was coming to pick it up from out-of-state no one checked to see if, well, the vehicle was ready to go. And then there was the issue with the keys which was maddening.

In Hayward, they offered to help, even told they would if they could prove that the help was justified, but, of course, they couldn’t and when speaking with the service manager about the issue after it had been fixed, he seemed annoyed that I was asking so many questions trying to figure out if anything had actually been fixed. And then they kept asking me for reviews after they’d “fixed” the issue and the Tiguan didn’t start again the next day.

But, again, these are just people who have been pulled into the maelstrom of the initial problem. We bought a defective vehicle. Defective from the very beginning. Defective to the point where three weeks of repair was not sufficient to fix the problem. Defective to the point were now three subsequent service appointments have neither diagnosed nor corrected the problem. Anyone can see that the issue is with the manufacturer, and no one could blame me at this point for having lost complete confidence in the entire brand at this point and demanding a complete refund. I don’t want another VW, hell, I wouldn’t take another VW at this point if they had offered me a fleet of free vehicles. At this point, when I see a VW driving down the road, I want to stare incredulously. “How it is possible that one of them even works?”

And, other than the single email which rejected, in one fell swoop, any claim I had to any corrective action from the manufacturer, I have received no word, had no contact with VW as a company.

Checking in here on a Sunday morning from San Miguel de Allende, MX., where I have lived for the last few years (NY originally, several years in Southern California before coming here).

Anyway, the last time I gambled, many years ago, was a brief diversion from a path of recovery I had dedicated a lot of energy to, and thankfully did not result in as crushing of a financial hardship as gambling usually did for me. The years of recovery and positive momentum - in short, the truth - helped me to return pretty quickly to sanity and prolonged abstinence. What I finally learned - unequivocally - was that gambling is not about the money, and that there was NO WAY - regardless of the financial outcome - that I could live a full, present life while gambling. I understood at the deepest levels and at the most practical ones too, that as soon as I even began to seriously consider gambling, even before I actually gambled, the most important aspects of my life - my close relationships, my health, dedication to my job, and even the simplest moments of being, like watching TV or sitting at a coffee shop with a friend, ALL become like living in a room when the light is dimmed by a dimmer switch, turned down about 70%.

Finally accepting this truth about me, that all prior episodes of my addictive gambling, starting with the preoccupied planning, the gambling itself, and the emotional hangover afterward (even after winning) made it impossible for me to be fully engaged in ANYTHING that had meaning in my life, I decided I did NOT want to live that way any longer, under the darkness of the ever-present dimmer switch.

Did it make me a ""bad person"" when I gambled? No. Was I terrible for being so distracted at my core? No. Was I any worse morally than the next person? No. Aside from all those questions though, I simply decided that LIVING in the important moments of my life was more important, more sacred, more true than continuing to live as a shell of myself, unable to give anyone else, including myself, the full spirit, presence, and personality that was the real me. (I mean, let's be honest. How's your love life when in the throes of gambling...?)

That revelation alone is not enough for one to do a 180 on their trip to the hell of addictive gambling. However, it provided me the added dose of truthful momentum to get back on track, realizing that no win - however great - would ever be worth living in the dark. Perhaps you can make that same choice if you are struggling...

It hasn’t stopped. Not for the past two weeks. I grappled with the idea of telling Emma throughout my sleepless nights, being tormented by my past while she slept soundly beside me. She knew something was wrong but I’ve been able to keep myself together. The insomnia has made work a disaster however and my boss sent me home early yesterday. He wasn’t angry but just seemed… worried about me. I’ve been so engrossed in my own world of panic and fear that has only grown lonelier and lonelier. Emma has really been the only one to break me out, even if just temporarily during our date night or while watching TV laid out on the couch. 

As I drove home last night, I tried to take my mind off of the knock by turning up the music in the car. I hoped the sound could drown out my own negative thoughts with something more positive and lively. As the first song ended however and the station went to a commercial break, my thoughts grew much darker much too quickly. 

The first commercial was for a local fast food restaurant, nothing I hadn't heard a thousand times before. The second however, noticeably dated and with crunchy, weaker audio, I had only heard once before and the sound of the opening jingle nearly sent me off the road.

Southside Square Mall, just on the outer edge of Harmon by the lonely north-south highway, closed in the summer of 2016. There were talks of what to do with the land but ultimately, it just sat empty for a lot longer than I think anybody hoped. The owners of the property did not want anyone getting inside. The first time they contracted my father’s company, it was for alarms and cameras. Kids were smarter than they thought however, and soon they were finding more creative ways inside than the floor to ceiling glass windows or boarded up main entrances. So eventually, my father was called upon again for a night watchman.

Southside Square wasn’t the location I was assigned to watch right after the boot came off but the memories of the abandoned bank or truck stop that were sandwiched between dissolved to barely a trace of a recollection. In my mind, the mall might as well have come right after the factory. 

It was the first large assignment my father felt comfortable with me undertaking by myself. After what happened at the factory, he’d been treating me differently. He always looked at me with worry and fear in his eyes no matter the conversation. He gave me smaller and closer locations and admittedly I was happy to return to the mundane nights of nothingness I’d grown to expect from the job. Time at each location was short lived however as watchmen tended to rotate jobs every month or so, especially at smaller locations like the ones my father had been giving me. Finally my time had come to draw the shortest straw. At least I thought it was at the time.

I remember pulling up to the chain link fence that surrounded the property, the headlights of the car barely able to make out the shape of the building. It seemed so far from where I stood, a sea of parking separating myself from the structure. Grass and weeds grew up from the cracks in the concrete, tire marks scarring the asphalt from kids doing burnouts and doughnuts. The exterior of the building looked tired, its entryway windows foggy and doors blocked off. The concrete walls were stained with grime and signs were faded or outright missing. Where they once hung were ghostly outlines of what once was.

The security trailer was on the far side of the mall, near the entrance which used to house the food court. The trailer was fitted the same as I’d come to expect and I spent the first night settling into the office and getting a lay of the land. The mall did not have power anymore but luckily the last owners never upgraded their directories to digital so the maps were very helpful in navigating the building. It had been a couple years since I’d been inside and in the dark, any landmarks that I remembered from when I was younger were shrouded in the shadows. Unlike my previous locations, part of the parameters of my job included walking the interior of the mall. I guess because the owners actually believed the building was worth saving in some form. 

Over the course of my first week I slowly got more familiar with the layout of the mall’s interior. I started to memorize where stores were, and sometimes remember what was there when I was younger. Towards the end a lot of businesses left the mall and were seemingly replaced by no-name cheaper alternatives. It was sort of a fun nostalgia trip for me, roaming the halls of a place that I’d once spent so much of my time and had a lot of good memories. I even found the bench where I’d had my first kiss. 

By the second week, I’d caught my first trespassers. I remember hearing rumblings of the abandoned mall when I was in high school so I imagined I’d come across kids at some point or another. It was a group of kids, probably a couple years younger than I was. I spotted them on the camera coming in through one of the old loading docks while aimlessly wasting my time in the trailer. I sighed, knowing I’d probably not get the best response from the boys. The first time I’d caught trespassers, it was at the truck stop. High school kids as well, probably from the neighboring district to Harmon. They laughed at me when I told them to leave and it took an actual call to the police to get them to listen. I guess I wasn’t the most intimidating presence. I still could’ve easily passed as one of their classmates.

I groaned as I pulled myself out of the office chair, preparing mentally for a difficult encounter and probably some name calling I’d rather not elaborate on. I grabbed my flashlight, pepper spray and baton, sliding them onto my belt and stepping out into the cool evening breeze. The overgrown trees in the islands of the parking lot swayed gently amongst the forest on the horizon but stranded in the ocean of concrete. The building loomed over me, its black silhouette contrasting with the bright, vibrant stars of the night sky. One of the few things that I truly loved about growing up in the middle of nowhere.

I trekked towards the food court entrance, light rain starting to pitter on and off as I unlocked the large security door over the glass airlock. When the door shut behind me, any sound of the outside world was squashed. The mall was dead silent. The stale air inside the building felt heavy, strangely worse than I’d grown accustomed to. I took out my flashlight and clicked it on. I walked past the empty fast food counters, only the dated tiling on the walls indicating what restaurants that would’ve once been. I grazed over each of the counters with my flashlight but it was so quiet inside the building, I could’ve heard those kids breathing. I knew wherever they were, it was a fair distance away from me. 

The main thoroughfares of the mall had seen better days. Any plants inside had either died or overgrown their pots and spread onto the increasingly cracked tile floor. Signs had fallen off or were stolen from their mountings. The occasional storefront window was smashed in. Furniture was strewn about haphazardly. Water stains dotted the white ceilings. The mall wasn’t absolutely trashed but it would’ve taken serious money to get it into any presentable state again. 

It took a good ten minutes before I finally started to hear voices, laughter at the far end of the wing I’d found myself traveling down. One of the large anchor stores sat with its entranceway wide open like a gaping mouth, revealing a truly black abyss inside where no light extended further than ten feet. The kids, two boys and a girl, didn’t notice me at the other end of the hallway as I spotted them. They were too busy peaking their heads into the abyss of the department store. The sign above their heads still displayed the store name, however the company had long since given up on Southside Square. 

I approached them as quietly as I could muster, not wanting them to run off and lead me on a wild goose chase. As much as I’d tried to study the mall’s layout, I was not confident in my hide and seek skills. I watched the kids whispering to each other, checking their phones and shining their flashlights into the empty stores around them. Before I knew it, it was time to make myself known.

“Hey, you guys can’t be in here. This is private property.” I said calmly as I approached them. I’d learned my first go around that the tough guy approached was not something I could pull off. The three of them quickly spun around and froze at the sight of me.

“W-who are you?” The taller of the two boys asked, his voice slightly nasally.

“I’m the night watchman. Now please, I can’t let you guys stay here, this is trespassing.” I explained, trying to keep a professional manner. The other boy’s eyes lit up.

“W-wait so you’re here like every night?” He questioned. He turned to the young girl, who I could only imagine was forcefully dragged into the situation. Unlike the boys, she seemed genuinely afraid of me. “Julia, he’s got to know where it is. Ask him.” He whispered to her.

“Ryan, are you an idiot? H-he’s here to fucking arrest us.” She replied angrily, still with fear in her eyes. I couldn’t help but break a smile.

“Guys I’m not going to arrest you, alright. I’m not a cop. But if you don’t leave, I will be forced to call them. And if I see you on the property again, same deal.” I tried to reassure them.

“W-wait but we need to find something. We weren’t going to break stuff or anything I swear.” The taller boy tried bartering.

“Y-yeah, my girlfriend told me about this place her friends went to and I had to see if I could find it myself.” The other boy who I could assume was Ryan, elaborated. I bit my lip for a second, genuinely a little curious about what place exactly they were talking about. I knew a few spots in the mall were pretty cool and unusual but in my own mind, none of them risked being caught trespassing. Then again, I was the one doing the catching.

“What exactly are you talking about?” I hesitantly asked, a little ashamed of myself for giving into my curiosity. Ryan nudged his girlfriend to speak. She gave him an annoyed look and stepped forward.

“We um… m-my friends told me about this store in the mall that they said they never remember being there. One of the big ones with two floors. It was like, really old looking. Like 70s old. And it… they said it messes with you. Like your head. I guess it’s haunted or something? I don’t know, they were probably lying just to freak me out since I didn’t go with them. Then these two found out and uh… I got dragged along anyway.” She explained, letting out a sigh. “I knew this was a bad idea.”

I gave her a puzzled look. I knew every anchor store in the mall, by heart at this point. They were so easily recognizable, locating them took a matter of five minutes even if you’d never step foot inside the building before. And I found it incredibly odd that anybody, even a few stupid kids, couldn’t find them all. 

“Did the store have a name?” I regretted asking as I really started to question why I was even continuing this conversation and we weren’t walking to the exit.

“No man, they just said they didn’t remember it being here. And those girls were here like every day after school when we were little. They would’ve remembered.” The taller boy answered quickly.

“It might’ve closed when they were young. And if they were experiencing anything psychological, there could’ve been a gas leak in the building. That’s one of the reasons it's not safe to be here.” I said, trying to reach logical explanations for their claims. In the back of my head however, I was deathly curious. I wanted to find this store myself, but I knew I had to do my job first. I had to escort these kids out of the mall.

It took a lot of back and forth and a few threats to the police before they finally agreed to leave. I felt like I’d spent hours going around in a circle with these kids but by the time we were back in the desolate parking lot it had barely been twenty minutes. They warned me more of their classmates were likely to try looking for the store to which I replied “Then the police are going to have a busy week ahead of them” as ominous as I could. They simply laughed as they walked back down the empty road and I rolled my eyes as I locked the gate behind me.

When I turned back around to face the mall the feeling in the air had changed. This place that I thought I’d learned like the back of my hand now had this aura of mystery and allure that I never had felt before. Even if the kid’s story was full of shit, which I assumed it was, it could be kind of fun to see which anchor they were looking for. But maybe there was more truth to the story than I wanted to believe. As much as I had tried to move on from the factory, moments of it stuck with me and when I closed my eyes, I could still see myself in that moonlit room. I could see the Knocker standing in the doorway, studying me while completely motionless. My optimistic curiosity soured as the thoughts ran through my mind and I returned to reality. I didn’t understand what happened to me that night in the factory but I know what I saw. There was danger in the darkness, especially alone. 

Feeling a grim mood rush over me, I decided not to venture back inside that night. For the first time since my first couple of nights back, I was feeling a strong wave of anxiety and nervousness. I couldn’t stay still watching the cameras. I’d constantly pace around the room, popping my head to the window to try to catch some sort of monster looking back at me. But there was never anything there. Just the empty parking lot surrounding me on all sides.

The next night I was forced back inside the mall. Southside Square’s layout was odd but there was a central corridor that all others led off or connected back to. I’d learned these different wings of the mall by the street names they were given. All named after trees except for Main, it was a relic of the mall’s earliest era but the faux street signs still stood at the intersection of every hallway. They were bolted straight into concrete which made them difficult to steal, unlike many of the newer fixtures that once dotted the common spaces of the mall.

As I passed “Pine Street”, the wing that led exclusively to a home improvement store, I noticed something peculiar. Across the way, shrouded in a somehow thicker darkness away from the shine of the moon, was a parallel wing. It has similar shops and at the end, an immense entrance to some kind of anchor store. The store’s wood paneled exterior and warm colored display windows seemed bizarrely dated for the mid 2000s fixtures and design of the rest of the mall. Southside Square had gone through several renovations and as far as I was aware, there was essentially no remnant of its 70s and 80s era heyday. But this didn’t make me interested or curious. It startled me. It scared me. It was unknown. There wasn’t supposed to be a parallel wing to Pine Street. It was supposed to be for Chestnut. I slowly turned my head to see further down the main concourse, assuming maybe I was remembering wrong. Or maybe someone had somehow switched the signs. But my fears were confirmed. Chestnut and Main crossed each other just as they always did. 

I turned to face the foreign and blindly began walking. The air felt colder as I stepped down the wing, increasingly so as I approached the anchor store. I shined my light up above its gaping entrance way. The name Randall’s was written out in script with a red with white outline. The sign seemed aged, its colors faded and washed out noticeably where light bulbs used to illuminate it. Unlike the other anchor stores, Randall’s didn’t have the theft prevention gates guarding the wide expansive entrance. Only stand up advertisement signs greeted me, listing the sales that had long since passed and new inventory that had long gone out of style. 

I stood at the entrance to Randall’s for a long time, studying the store. Trying to conjure up some kind of memory of the place. Anything to confirm to me that what I was looking at had always been there. While I could see into the store, whatever light the mall’s dirty skylights provided was snuffed out less than 20 feet in. It left the dark shadows of shelves, mannequins and displays up to the imagination. My flashlight’s beam barely penetrated into the store’s sales floor, leaving me just as in the dark, so to speak, as before. A draft blew over me from within the cavernous opening of Randall’s, the wind whispering through my ears.  It sent a shiver down my spine as I finally started to back away from the storefront. I wanted to know more, desperately so. But it didn’t feel right. The entrance to the store felt like a venus fly trap waiting for its prey to walk inside. 

It was a ridiculous thought, I knew that. It was just a building, brick, steel and concrete. It couldn’t hurt me, not any more than any other abandoned building that is. I thought about how I was overreacting as I walked back to the security trailer. As I opened the door to step inside, I looked back at the mall and tried to spot where Randall’s would’ve been located. The anchor stores were quite obvious from the outside, more so than any other store. I counted the big brown and beige boxes that stuck out from the sides and ends of the mall, listing which store was where. But I couldn’t find Randall’s. Not for the life of me. I cast my eyes across the building multiple times. It should’ve been clear as day. Another bump in the hills and valleys of the mall’s outline. But it simply wasn’t there.

I didn’t leave the trailer for the rest of the night, trying to take my mind off of Randall’s and the school of questions swimming in my head. The isolation, the silence of the space I found myself in made my thoughts simply echo off the walls of my brain. I watched the clock tick agonizingly slowly as the sun finally started to peak over the horizon line. Grabbing my things, I waited impatiently by the door for my relief. 

Leonard pushed open the door fifteen minutes late, something I honestly did expect but desperately hoped wouldn’t have been the case this morning. He was a tall, lanky man in his late twenties. Shaggy brown hair was kept at bay by the cap nestled on his head and his five o’clock shadow was haphazardly shaved. I remember him working at the fast food restaurant downtown when I was little. He was always nice to me from behind the counter, and made sure I got the toy I wanted in the kid’s meal. You never forgot a face in Harmon. Everyone knew everyone and most of us would never leave.

I asked Leonard about Randall's when he walked in the doorway but he wasn't of much help. The man was barely awake as usual and didn't even register my question until I said it for the third time. ""N-no Adam, it's really not ringing a bell. If I think of something. I'll leave a note for you on the desk, alright?""

On my drive back home, I yawned as I sought through the radio stations. The early morning didn’t net a lot of good results up in the middle of the scenic nowhere I called home. As I passed between two of the stations I knew did come through, something came through the static on a station I didn’t recognize. At first it was subtle, barely audible above the white noise. I took my hand off the dial, genuinely curious what was coming in over what I could only have imagined was a rare long distance station. It was unrecognizable, just a hint of music along with voices. As I came to a red light however, I turned up the volume and tried to decipher what was coming through. The static slowly faded and the transmission began to clear up. It sounded dated however, something recorded onto an analog machine with that tinny sounding voice you’d hear on old tv shows.

“-for your family this summer. Randall’s is the only place to shop. We can’t wait to see you very soon.” A dated, midwestern accent read. A short jingle followed, telling the listener the best price and best service was only a short drive away. “A store so special you’ll never want to leave” it ended with. The commercial then started over. And I listened to it again, and again, and again. The same jingle, the same scripted voice. The same slogan. After the third time, I knew I wasn’t going crazy and I wasn’t just sleep deprived. Randall’s was real. And it wanted to make sure I believed it.

My father was sitting in the family room with my mom, watching the morning news while sipping on freshly brewed coffee. I could smell the aroma as I walked through the kitchen door. Both my parents turned to look at me as I stepped through the doorway, warm smiles on their faces. Since Sean had left, I was the only one left for them to give attention to. Sometimes that was a blessing, other times it was a curse. 

“Hey kiddo, how was your night last night?” My dad asked, but I didn’t answer him. My mind was elsewhere and I walked past them like a zombie. “Was Leonard late this morning again, I noticed you… came in… late.” His words fell off as I swung myself around the stairs. Out of the corner of my eye I saw my parents’ smiling facing morph to concerned looks. My brain was filled with nothing but fear and questions, and I didn’t know which was fueling which more. I couldn’t even give them an attempt of acknowledgement. I was physically and mentally exhausted.

“Richard, see what’s going on with him. H-he didn’t look right.” I heard my mother insist to my father from the top of the stairs. My dad let out a sigh.

“Yeah… yeah there’s something up. I can tell. I uh… see what I can find out. You know how he gets though.” He replied, groaning as he stood up from the couch and put down his mug on the coffee table. “I hope it’s not… work related. Especially after what happened back in May.”

“If it is, we’re going to have to have a talk about this. I know you say he’s up to this but… he’s our son, Richard.” My mom insisted.

“Oh trust me, Rach. We will.” He agreed. I was already shutting my bedroom door as I heard his footsteps race up the stairs in chase of me. I laid out on my bed, rubbing my temples as I prepared for the interrogation I was about to receive. My father knocked on the door right on queue.

“Hold on Dad, just… I need a second.” I pleaded, my voice exhausted.

“Adam, please open the door.” My father said quietly but with a hint of firmness in his tone. I heaved myself to my feet and swung open the door.

“What?” I asked plainly, my brain already starting to shut down for my morning nap. It was a routine I wasn’t proud of but staying up all night, it was the only way to recharge.

“Did something happen last night at work? Because your mother and I both know when something’s going on with you, kiddo.” He gave me as sincere a smile as he could, even chuckling a little as he finished speaking. But behind his expression I could tell he was concerned. It was the same look as when he first laid eyes on me in the emergency room.

“Dad, have you ever heard of a department store in the mall named Randall’s?” I asked flat out, completely ignoring his question. I think no matter how I intended to respond to him, the same answer would’ve come out whether I liked it or not. He stared straight at me, stiff as a board. His face didn’t move a muscle and for the first time I truly couldn’t get a read on my father’s normally very expressive face. All I could see were his eyes and they did not change. He was scared. I’m just not sure if his fear came from the question I asked or the anticipation that I might’ve asked it. After a moment, he collected himself, loosed up and spoke three words as clear and calm as ever.

“No, I haven’t.” He told me. His eyes burned into mine, desperately awaiting my response. I nodded slowly.

“Well I um… just thought I saw something about it in the mall.” I lied, “An ad on the floor or something. Just… never remembered it being there is all.”

“Your memory serves you right, that store doesn’t exist as far as I can remember.” He told me. “Could ask your mom though, she was usually the one to take you shopping.” 

“Right yeah… maybe I will. It’s just I caught these kids last night and they were saying something about a store that wasn’t on the mall maps so I thought since I didn’t remember Randall’s-”

“Adam, I personally have surveyed that property a dozen times. At this point so have you and you tell me, is there an anchor store called Randall’s that you’ve seen?” He wondered, genuinely looking curious to hear my response.

I hesitated. “N-no, I don’t think so.” I finally replied. 

“Then what are we getting so worked up about, kiddo?” My father questioned, trying to return to his positive mood. “I mean are you really letting some kid’s creepy story get to you?”

“No, i-it wasn’t even creepy.” I had to admit, telling the truth without at all indulging in the details of my night. “It just was uh… off putting. I-I was on edge the whole night.” My father put his hand on my shoulder, sitting me down on my bed beside him.

“Listen, I know you had a rough start to the job. What happened was… it wasn’t what I wanted. And that was a one in a million chance.” He paused for a moment, trying to word what he wanted to say next. “And I just… It’s important that… I-I want you to feel safe. We don’t get a lot of crazies out here squatting in these places. You know that by now. This job is supposed to be pretty straight forward, you know? Low stress. And seeing you walk in here looking like you saw a ghost, ignoring your mother and me, that doesn’t seem like a low stress night on the job.”

“Y-yeah I’m sorry, Dad. I should’ve at least said hi to you guys. I just… had a lot on my mind. And I really am exhausted.” I apologized, still trying to justify myself as much as I could.

“It’s alright, Adam. Just… don’t let those stories get to you. They’ll drive you crazy, especially when you have the whole night alone to think about them.” He advised me, standing up and stretching his back. “If you want to talk more about anything, you know I’m always here. A-and as your dad, not your boss. Just to clarify.”

I cracked a smirk, couldn’t help it. “Y-yeah, Dad. I get it.”

“Good, good. Listen, I’ve got to make a couple appointment calls this morning but if there’s anything you need me for, I’m pretty open this afternoon.” He offered.

“I’ll see when I wake up.” I told him, yawning a little.

“Of course, of course. I won’t delay that any longer.” He assured me. “Oh and Adam, I know I probably don’t say this as much as I should but… love you, kiddo.”

“Thanks Dad, love you too.”

He nodded as he slipped out of my room and pulled out his phone from his pocket. I watched him quickly dial a number as he headed for his office at the end of the hall.

“Yes, can I speak to Dr. Ackerman… It's urgent.” There was an insistence in his voice as he grabbed the door behind him and tugged it to shut as he stepped inside. “Hey this is Rich from \[redacted\] Securities-” The door closed behind him with a slow clunk. From there, my father’s voice was an unintelligible garble. 

What little I caught of the call concerned me. He was clearly lying to my face about speaking to clients, I wasn’t an idiot. And who he did call did not seem like his medical doctor. I thought it must’ve been the property owner at the time. But that wasn’t what actually scared me.

My father asked me if I’d ever seen an anchor store called Randall’s. And while I’ll readily admit I lied straight to his face. Something I felt very guilty doing. He had done the same. I knew the second he’d asked that question because I never told him Randall’s was an anchor store.

The entire day I didn’t speak to anyone in the house. My mom was out running errands and my father kept his distance from me. He ended up going into the office in the afternoon and it left me completely alone in the quiet of an empty house. I debated with myself for what felt like hours whether I should look for Randall’s that night. If I would even find it where I’d left it the night before. And if I did, should I step foot inside? The painfully curious side of my brain was almost begging my more rational side to let loose and just walk in. But I knew there was something wrong with that place. And in my gut I knew it was stupid to walk in alone. So I called the only person who’d be stupid enough to take the leap of faith with me.

“Hey man, what’s up? You off work tonight or something?” Devon asked as the phone finally connected. His voice seemed monotone, as if my call had woken him up despite it being 3:30 in the afternoon. It wouldn’t have surprised me.

“No I uh… ok this is going to sound stupid.” I opened, my own tone more serious.

“Most of what you say is, Adam.” He joked back. I rolled my eyes.

“Very funny.” I said sarcastically. “But seriously, do you remember a store at Southside Square called Randall’s? Like an anchor store not inside the mall.”

“I… I don’t think so. Wait, aren't you watching that place these days?” he remembered.

“Yeah, the past couple of weeks actually.” I confirmed. “So you’ve never heard of Randall’s at all?” I reiterated.

“N-no dude I really haven’t um… can I ask why exactly you’ve got your panties in a knot over this?”

I gave him the entire rundown of the past two nights, the kids looking for the store, the rumor going around their high school, then my own encounter with Randall’s. I tried my best to describe the area I found myself in but he didn’t really understand.

“Adam, I'm really struggling to understand what you’re telling me. So there’s a part of the mall that all of us just didn’t notice existed for however many decades the place has been open? I looked it up while you were talking and I could not find a single thing online.” Devon tried to wrap his head around the idea, clearly thinking I was either high out of my mind or losing it.

“I-I don’t know, Devon. I don’t think it ever existed. And everyone I’ve asked has said the same. But I know what I saw.” I assured him, being as stern as I ever had been with my best friend. Devon let out a sigh.

“Alright Adam, I believe you think you saw whatever you saw but I-I honestly don’t know what else to say here man. Is… is there something I can do? Do you need help? Anything man, you know I’ll be there.” He offered, sounding both concerned and desperate.

“I want you to come to work with me tonight.” I said plainly. 

“A-are you sure that’s-”

“It’s fine, my dad won’t care.” I interrupted. “And if he does… I’ll deal with it, it’ll be fine. I just need… I need someone to tell me what I’m seeing is real. Or maybe that I really am just crazy.”

“Well, you know I won’t pass up a free ride to an abandoned place. And to tell you you’re going crazy. When should I be there?”

“Swing by around 5:30.” 

“I’ll be there.” He assured me.

Devon was always exactly on time, it was a bizarre skill that I never seemed to master. And today was no different. He knocked on my door at 5:30 on the dot just as I was throwing my shoes on. We jumped in my car and started heading down towards the south end of Harmon. The mall wasn’t far from my house, but then again nothing was. We sat at the traffic light, the sun’s evening golden rays shining over the tree line and gently accenting the building in the distance. The radio station had gone to commercials but we didn’t bother changing it. We were too busy talking. It felt good to talk, especially to Devon. It kept my mind off the job that I was going back to. 

“You know I haven’t been in that place in a couple of years. Honestly it was still pretty clean, I don’t think a lot of people had figured out a way in. How’s it looking these days?” Devon wondered, his gaze drifting to the abandoned mall.

“It’s not the worst I’ve seen. People definitely did their fair share of damage though honestly. Lots of tags, broken windo-” I froze in mid sentence. The radio had gone static in the time I started to speak and it took me just that split second to recognize exactly what had started playing.

“A-Adam? You alright, man?” Devon looked at me concerned.

“D-do you hear this song? T-the commercial?” I stuttered my way out. The Randall’s commercial played as loudly as its poorly recorded audio could muster, echoing through the car’s tired speakers. Devon listened intently, and I watched his expression shift as he started to realize it was exactly, to a tee, what I had described to him over the phone. 

“I-it’s the-”

“It’s the same fucking thing, dude. The same thing I heard this morning after leaving work.” I confirmed. “I’m telling you, there is something wrong going on.”

“A-are you fucking with me, Adam? Because I swear to god if-”

“I’m not.” I said sternly.

“W-why does it just keep repeating?” He asked, his voice trembling just slightly. I shook my head as the light finally turned green.

“I-I don’t know. Let’s just… get up there and out of the car. Turn off the radio.”

“Didn’t have to tell me twice.”

The mall loomed over us as we drove up through the gate. Leonard had already left, as was usual, and I locked up before we made it to the security trailer. The silence in the car as we traveled over the cracked asphalt ocean was agonizing but Devon, the one who I hoped would keep my own brain in check, was thoroughly freaked out. I hadn’t seen him like this since we’d tried to shortcut through the woods while trick-or-treating in fourth grade.

We stopped in the security trailer momentarily and I gave Devon a quick tour. I looked for a note from Leonard but as I expected, it was nowhere to be found. Devon tried messing around with the cameras, telling me it was just because he thought they were cool. However I could tell in his eyes, he was looking for something in particular. I didn’t let him look for long, I knew he wouldn’t find anything on the cameras. I’d already tried. I handed him a flashlight from the locker and took one for myself. 

“Come on man, let’s go. We’re just… wasting time.” I insisted. He stood up from the desk, the chair rolling back to the wall.

“Right… delaying the inevitable. I-I just don’t know exactly what the inevitable is.”

“Neither do I.” I admitted.

The interior of the mall looked the same as I’d left it. Devon was like a kid in a candy store, throwing up his phone and taking pictures of everything that we passed. I felt like a father having to drag his kid around the mall. And I suppose in a sense I was. Even if Devon was two months older than me. 

While he was taking pictures, I was watching the street signs. Willow, Maple, Chestnut and finally Pine. I put my arm out to stop Devon as I stared at the eerily dark hallway to Randall’s. He gave me a confused look before his eye caught the faded red sign.

“H-holy shit. But I didn’t see-”

“You wouldn’t have. I didn’t either.” I admitted to him. We both slowly approached the entranceway, the coldness becoming increasingly noticeable as the gaping mouth of the store grew larger and larger in front of us.

“Jesus Christ, Adam.” Devon exclaimed as we stopped right on the threshold of the tile flooring. I could see the goosebumps on his arms. “This is not… this isn’t normal. This feels wrong.”

“I know… but we need to know what it is.” I took the first step forward, looking up at the doorway and expecting giant teeth to chomp down on me. But nothing happened. I walked inside just like any other store in the mall. Devon hesitantly did the same. We walked further inside, not saying a word but conveying a thousand with our just eyes. The store was quiet, deathly so. It felt like a soundproof room, separated from reality through every sense. 

Our flashlight beams seemed to shine dimmer as we walked further. The store was becoming colder, so much so that I was shivering with my security jacket on. Our steps became more hesitant and without even realizing it, we were holding onto each other’s sleeves. We were enveloped in the deepest, most isolating darkness I’d ever experienced. I could barely make out Devon next to me, but I felt his hand shakily clenching my shirt. That’s when I started to hear him scream.

His hand dug into my arm and I first I was both confused and terrified. My best friend began crying hysterically, calling out names. Some I recognized, some I didn’t. He tried to run but I held him back, terrified of losing my only source of tangibility. 

“A-Adam, w-why are they talking to me? W-why are they doing this? P-p-please just make it stop!” He pleased with me, nearly falling to his knees. I nearly broke down crying myself. I’d never felt so helpless. I couldn’t even see my best friend, only hear his own suffering as he held onto my arm. 

“I-it’s going to be ok, Devon. We’re going to get out of here I-I swear.” I tried looking around for anything. Shelves, a sign, furniture, a landmark. But the darkness had consumed it all. The store was so dark, I was starting to question whether my eyes were even open. I started to feel things brush pass me as I dragged Devon along aimlessly. He stumbled behind me, crying hysterically. My heart was beating out of my chest as my steps forward became more difficult. The things brushing past me became to feel like a crowd of people I was wading through. I could hear their unintelligible whispers in the voices of people I could easily recognize. My mom, dad, grandparents, aunts and uncles. Dead, alive or otherwise, their voices filled my ears as I pushed forward and dragged Devon behind me. My ears were overwhelmed and I could feel the tears starting to streak down my face as I felt whatever stamina I had left giving out on me. My leg finally gave out and I tripped over something in the darkness. I collapsed to the ground and took Devon down with me. I felt his arm momentarily lose its grip before desperately clawing at the fabric of my sleeve to recapture it. 

When I looked up, all I saw in front of me was the messy, abandoned center corridors of the Southside Square Mall. Devon was still behind me, laying flat out on the tile face down balling his eyes out. I turned my head behind us at the façade of Randall’s. Its security gate was shut, the metallic structure old and rusted, as if it hadn’t moved in 30 years. Behind it you still couldn’t see further than twenty feet inside. But amongst the shadows I could see people shuffling from within. And they were staring at us, looking right into my eyes. I turned my head away, never daring to turn back. I threw up right there on the floor and completely broke down, crying next to my best friend for what felt like hours.

I never walked past Pine Street again. I always lied on my reports, and never dared follow any trespassers. I'd just sit in the trailer and call the police. Devon and I agreed to never speak of what happened again. And I didn’t hear from him for over a month. Luckily we’re still as close as ever, something I was worried wouldn’t be the case after Randall’s.

I never again asked a soul about the department store Randall’s, the anchor store that doesn’t exist. And I never heard a soul speak of it in return. No mention that it ever had or ever would exist. Not until just two hours ago last night. I haven’t told Emma. But I think I need to. She saw it on my face, there was no hiding it. I’m scared, terrified. And at this point, I don’t know what I should do. I think I should call Devon but I don’t know how he’ll respond. I can’t just keep letting these things happen because one of these nights Emma’s going to be waiting for me and I’m not going to come home.",2,1745768026.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I'd danced for 3 hour with 2 strangers I didn't even know and didn't ask for a ride back. Was walking through downtown with my hands in my pockets and my dick in my hand. Saw a chicken running around the sidewalk without anyone nearby in the quiet dark. 

I asked the bus driver if I could bring it on board after promising to hold onto it since no one else was on board. 

My neighbor was passed out on his couch like usual with the TV on. Since I don't let anyone or anything that shits into my apartment, I left the chicken inside my neighbor's open door room and let him find out when he woke up. 

He was delighted when I brought him some coffee the next morning. I told him the chicken showed up at our apartment somehow and that it must belong to a neighbor nearby.

I tried taking the chicken to campus but before I could even cross the street from Starthern, an elderly lady who i say hi to sometimes came to make small talk as she walked her puppy. I didn't have time to stand around talking about my cock with her. So I tried ending the convo by offering her the chicken because I had a full day of studying I needed to do for a worthless midterm with material I'd forget about in 1 year from now after taking more classes in between. 

She gladly accepted the chicken. I am happy it has a new home and maybe can lay some eggs to eat. 


Folks, it's amazing how something like a chicken can bring many smiles and help folks save money too. The last two times my buddy took me to Costco, we saw jackasses running inside the refrigerator isle grabbing 3 crates of eggs and pushing people.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the Detroit Tigers and Baltimore Orioles, a matchup that promises all the excitement of a lukewarm cup of coffee. But hey, who doesn't love a Sunday afternoon game where the stakes are as high as the price of a ballpark hot dog?

The Tigers are looking to sweep the Orioles, and with Tarik Skubal on the mound, they might just have the broom in hand. Skubal's been a beast at Comerica Park, boasting a 14-2 record with a 1.82 ERA since 2023. Meanwhile, Dean Kremer is having a season that makes you wonder if he's pitching with his eyes closed, allowing an MLB-high 36 hits in just 25 innings. Yikes.

The Tigers have been the moneyline favorite 14 times this season, and they've won 10 of those games. With a team ERA of 2.95, they rank third in MLB, which is impressive unless you're the Orioles, who are probably just hoping to make it through the game without any major injuries.

The Orioles have been underdogs 11 times this season and have managed to win five of those games. Not too shabby, but not exactly inspiring confidence either. They do have some power in their lineup, ranking eighth in the majors with 33 homers, but let's be honest, they're going to need more than a few dingers to get past Skubal and the Tigers' bullpen.

Now, for the betting folks out there, the Tigers are sitting pretty at 1.43 on the moneyline, while the Orioles are a tempting 3.1. But unless you enjoy living dangerously, I'd stick with the Tigers. The spread has the Tigers at -1.5 with odds around 1.95, which seems like a safe bet given Kremer's struggles.

As for the total, it's set at 7.5 runs. With Skubal on the mound, the under at 1.81 looks like the smart play, unless you think the Orioles' bats are going to suddenly wake up from their slumber.

So, in summary, bet on the Tigers to win, maybe even cover the spread, and enjoy the game. Just don't expect fireworks unless you're talking about the post-game show.

Suddenly, these small bumps appeared out of nowhere, and they just won't go away.

One thing I suspect might be the water I use to wash my face — I think it has a high iron content, and maybe that's affecting my skin.
As for skincare, I don’t use many products. For the past two years, I’ve only used Cetaphil moisturizer. About three months ago, I also added the Cetaphil cleanser and Cetaphil sunscreen.

1k96jol,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1k96jol/uvita_for_the_first_tips_tips/,"Uvita for the first tips, tips!","I’ll be going to Uvita the third week of May for at least 2 weeks 

It’s my first time in CR and I’ll be a solo traveler (aside from one weekend I plan to join a small retreat) 

Anyways, a few questions 

1) I’m looking for the best, most affordable and safe way to get from the airport to Uvita 

I’m wondering if I should just rent a car as it’s my first time in CR and I do work remote so if I do enjoy my time in Uvita, I could stay there longer or move to a new location and stay a bit longer while I work

If I rent a car, are there cheap companies you’d recommend? Trying to keep this trip as affordable as possible — or would you just suggest ubering / public transportation / walking (if that’s an option?) 

2) How is Uvita in general? Is it typically safe? Is two weeks there plenty? Any recs for things to do? Are beaches free? 

3) If I do choose to relocate after ~2 weeks in Uvita, where would you suggest? 

I’m a simple girl, I love fresh local produce and markets, cooking, the beach, sunsets finding new coffee shops, but I also would love to do/see cool things you can only do in CR!! I’m down for anything! 

4) what is the weather like in May-June? How should I pack? I was thinking mostly active wear, bikini, and a flowy dress or 2. 


Any other general tips would be so appreciated!

But here’s something powerful—prayer. It’s not just about asking for help. Prayer can strengthen your faith, renew your hope, and help you regain your footing. When we pray, we’re not just seeking answers; we’re building a deeper relationship with God. It’s in those quiet, heartfelt moments with Him that we find the strength to keep going. So let’s take a look at five daily prayers that will not only help you stay connected to God but also grow your faith when life gets hard.

# Why Prayer is Crucial for Building Faith in Hard Times

# The Power of Prayer: Connecting to God When Life Feels Heavy

When we face difficulties, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. That’s when our faith feels the heaviest. But prayer is like a bridge that connects us to God’s peace and strength. It’s in these moments of prayer that we remember that our strength doesn’t come from our own abilities—it comes from God.

Think of it like this: your faith is a muscle. The more you work it, the stronger it becomes. And just like physical muscles need regular exercise, your faith needs daily prayer to grow. Prayer is how we renew our trust in God and allow His power to work through us. It’s how we surrender our burdens to Him, knowing He will carry them for us. Through prayer, we develop a steadfast faith that can weather even the hardest storms.

# Holding on to God’s Promises in Times of Trial

One of the most beautiful things about prayer is how it reminds us of God's promises. In moments of struggle, we can lean on His Word and rest in the truth that He will never leave us. God’s promises are not just comforting words—they’re a lifeline.

For example, **Isaiah 41:10** says, *“Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.”* This verse isn’t just for the good times; it’s a promise for the hard times too. When we pray, we remind ourselves that God is with us every step of the way, even when we feel like we’re walking alone.

# 5 Powerful Daily Prayers to Strengthen Your Faith

# Prayer 1: A Prayer for Trust in God’s Plan

Sometimes life doesn’t make sense, and we can’t understand why we’re going through certain struggles. But that’s when we have to remember that God’s plan is bigger than anything we can see. Trusting in His perfect timing is essential for growing in faith.

**Sample Prayer**:  
*“Heavenly Father, in the midst of confusion, I trust in Your perfect plan for my life. I surrender my doubts and fears to You, knowing that You hold my future. Help me to rest in Your promises and have confidence that You will guide me through this challenge. Amen.”*

This prayer is a reminder that no matter how tough life gets, God’s plan is always working for our good. Trusting in His plan allows us to let go of anxiety and embrace His peace.

# Prayer 2: A Prayer for Courage in Adversity

Courage isn’t the absence of fear; it’s the strength to move forward in spite of it. Prayer gives us the courage to face what feels impossible and keep moving forward.

**Sample Prayer**:  
*“Lord, give me the courage to face the challenges before me. Strengthen my heart and remind me that with You, I am never alone. Help me to stand strong, trusting that You will equip me for whatever comes my way. Amen.”*

When we pray for courage, we’re asking God to fill us with His strength. This prayer helps us push past fear and face adversity with the assurance that God is fighting on our behalf.

# Prayer 3: A Prayer for Wisdom in Uncertainty

In difficult times, we often feel uncertain about which direction to take. This is where wisdom comes in. Prayer is the key to unlocking God’s guidance, and His wisdom can lead us through the fog of confusion.

**Sample Prayer**:  
*“Dear God, grant me wisdom as I navigate this season. Show me the path You want me to walk and give me the clarity to make the right decisions. I trust that Your wisdom will guide me through every moment of uncertainty. Amen.”*

When we pray for wisdom, we invite God’s clarity into our decisions. This prayer helps us step out of confusion and into peace, knowing that God’s direction is always the best one.

# Prayer 4: A Prayer for Peace in the Midst of Anxiety

Life has a way of making us anxious, especially when things are uncertain. Prayer is a way of inviting God’s peace into our hearts, even when the world around us is chaotic.

**Sample Prayer**:  
*“Father God, when anxiety overwhelms me, I ask for Your peace to calm my heart. Help me to rest in Your presence and trust that You are in control. Replace my worry with Your peace, and let me feel Your calming presence today. Amen.”*

This prayer is a reminder that God’s peace is more powerful than our anxiety. It helps us shift our focus from fear to faith, knowing that God is bigger than any worry.

# Prayer 5: A Prayer for Strength and Endurance

Life’s trials can feel exhausting, and sometimes we just don’t know how we’re going to keep going. Prayer gives us the strength and endurance we need to keep moving forward, even when we feel weak.

**Sample Prayer**:  
*“Lord, when I feel worn out and exhausted, renew my strength. Help me to keep pressing forward and to not give up, knowing that You are my source of endurance. I trust that with You, I can face anything. Amen.”*

Strength and endurance are gifts we receive through prayer. When we ask for them, we open the door for God to fill us with the energy and perseverance we need to keep moving forward.

# How to Make Prayer a Daily Habit in Hard Times

# Establishing a Consistent Prayer Routine

Prayer doesn’t work unless we make it a habit. Just like brushing your teeth or drinking your morning coffee, prayer should be part of your daily routine. The consistency of prayer helps keep our faith strong, no matter what we face.

Set aside time every day to pray. It could be first thing in the morning, during a lunch break, or right before bed. The key is to make prayer a regular part of your life. Over time, you’ll find that it becomes easier to lean on God, especially during hard times.

# Using Scripture in Your Daily Prayers

Integrating Bible verses into your daily prayers can strengthen your connection to God’s Word. When you pray scripture, you align your thoughts with God’s promises, making your prayer more powerful.

Pick out verses that speak to your specific situation. For instance, when you’re feeling anxious, turn to **Philippians 4:6-7** (*“Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.”*) to guide your prayer. Let these scriptures serve as reminders that God’s Word is a source of strength and hope.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

# How can prayer help me in difficult times?

Prayer is our direct line to God. It helps us stay connected to Him when life gets tough, providing strength, comfort, and guidance. Through prayer, we can surrender our worries, find peace, and receive wisdom.

# How do I pray when I feel hopeless?

Start by being honest with God. Share your struggles and ask for His help. Even when you feel hopeless, God’s love is constant, and His promises never fail. Prayer is a powerful way to reconnect with that truth.

# Can daily prayers really change my circumstances?

While prayer may not always change our external circumstances immediately, it changes us. Prayer strengthens our faith and helps us view our circumstances through God’s lens. As we pray, we find peace, clarity, and the courage to face whatever challenges come our way.

# Conclusion: Embrace Prayer as a Daily Source of Strength

When hard times come, don’t retreat into fear. Turn to prayer. These five daily prayers will help you strengthen your faith and build resilience through every challenge. Make prayer a part of your daily routine and see how it transforms your life. With God by your side, you can face anything.

Remember, prayer doesn’t just change your situation—it changes your heart. And when your heart is strong, you can weather any storm.

1k96jiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/1k96jiv/does_anyone_miss_when_the_show_was_more_about_the/,Does anyone miss when the show was more about the walkers?,I finished the last season of WD recently and I’ve just started watching the first season with my sister because she wanted to start watching and I noticed just how good the dialogue was and the character felt more human and less robotic. Not to mention the realism in their actions or reactions. When a character died or was bit they have genuine human like emotions and don’t just forget about it in a day like later seasons. It felt so simple like Carol talking about missing her coffee machine and not talking about whisperers or something else convoluted. I know the answer to this change is that characters develop over time and so will their personalities but still. I miss the genuine fear of the walkers the characters had when they were actually feared and not a nuisance like in later seasons. I really disliked how the show became less about walkers and just falling into the same pattern of fighting different groups and having to rebuild Alexandria constantly. The idea that the Commonwealth existed really ruined the story for me. For me the show really changed when they when to Alexandria for the first time. ,1,1745767594.0,thewalkingdead,4,0.6,False

I’m a 33-year-old guy from Chennai, excited to meet like-minded folks for friendship or possibly a deeper connection if we really click. I’m all about genuine vibes, great conversations, and sharing life’s adventures with awesome people.A bit about me:

* Background: Software Engineer, Chennai native, and fluent in English and Tamil. I’m a tech nerd (INTP) with a degree from Anna University.
* Personality: Thoughtful, geeky, and a bit introverted at first, but I open up with good company. I’m an agnostic atheist who loves deep chats about life, the universe, or just what makes us tick. Loyalty and authenticity are super important to me.
* Interests: Big into board games (let’s battle it out over a strategy game!), sci-fi stories, and nature—think treks for epic sunsets or chill walks. I also tinker with coding projects (like making games) and unwind with a solid playlist.
* Lifestyle: Non-smoker, mostly vegetarian but flexible, and I lean progressive. I’m child-free and enjoy a lifestyle focused on personal growth and meaningful experiences.

What I’m looking for:

* People (28-35, women preferred) in Chennai or nearby who are up for fun hangouts—grabbing coffee, playing board games, or diving into chats about sci-fi, movies, or big ideas.
* If we vibe well, I’m open to exploring a meaningful relationship with someone who loves intellectual convos, shared adventures, or just chilling together. Bonus points if you’re into geeky stuff or have a killer playlist to share!
* Based in Chennai but open to long-distance friendships within India if we connect.

I’m stoked to meet people who enjoy losing track of time in great conversations or creating memories over a board game or sunset walk. If this sounds like your kind of thing, hit me up with a DM or comment, and let’s chat!",2,1745767519.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

She was very good in that movie I wish she was cast as Izzy. The actress who played Izzy - Leah Finity - was ok she cried way too much in second half and here was my main beef. I understand crying on stage is really hard, I get it. The crying never seemed believable. It came across as a person who cries for attention - sure the face screws up and they make sobbing noises but eyes look dry. In second half of movie she cried and sobbed a lot. 

There were some really good ideas. The school being investigated was investigated by ghost hunters twice but second team didn’t know about first team which was a single woman. I liked the idea of showing the found footage from the first investigation. 

The second and main team I liked how the story was balanced between an estranged brother and sister thrown together for a case by the producer. She was a medium who helped a lot of widows whose dead husbands stuck around. I suspect in the case they showed the widow had mental issues in terms of believing her late husband finished the laundry and made her coffee. The widow was played by Lori Richardson who was in Conjuring Tapes as a manipulative cult leader she was also Mrs Claus in Livings other directed film Christmas Tapes which I have not seen. 

The host of the paranormal show was Wesley brother of Izzy. Wesley was not the brightest. He never stopped to wonder “why is a public school that’s been abandoned owned by someone isn’t this city owned”? Nope he just accepted the “owner” as real. 

At the start of movie he does an exorcism and the possessed said Wesley killed someone. Of course his producer and sound guy asks but just responds that demons lie. Later on we find out it’s true but accidental  and his sister knew thus they got estranged. I wish there was more of a connection of that with this case but it is left unanswered. It should have been an important storyline but went nowhere.

Wesley later on proved again he was not the brightest bulb when they found the previous found footage and decided to Scooby Doo the case and not get out and call police. 

Conjuring Tapes is a better film. There were good ideas like using two found footages for the location. I liked the idea of seeing Wesley and Izzy reconcile and try to figure it out. I hated the crying it never came across as real and Wesley was a bit too dumb. In some ways it seemed like an ordinary FF movie set in an abandoned school, hospital etc locale. 

The “owner” was played by Greg Sestero who cowrote the book The Disaster Artist which was turned into a film played by James and David Franco which I have not seen. Digging further Sestero based the book on his experience with movie The Room of which a sequel was just completed according to IMDb with Greg and his cowriter and costar/director Tommy Wiseau. I also didn’t see The Room. 

Infrared is on Tubi. I would watch Conjuring Tapes first it’s overall a better movie. Conjuring Tapes is better put together, stories are more crisp, this one while it had good ideas seemed ordinary.",0,1745767490.0,horror,0,0.33,False

1k96ho6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1k96ho6/ladies_30s_can_you_relate/,"Ladies, 30s can you relate?","Yo. So, two weeks ago I downloaded Bumble—mainly to look for someone specific. I'm 34F, and I’d really love to hear from other women around my age (since girls in their 20s might have a totally different take on this).
Anyway, that mission flopped, but I stayed on the app because I started getting SuperSwipes and got curious about the profiles. Then I started swiping myself just to see what’s out there.

Now here’s my question to fellow women: do you actually find those profiles appealing where guys look like they’re starring in a movie trailer? You know the type—posed pics with cocktails, leaning on cars, shirtless on some Bali beach, etc. Is that really attractive to you?
Because to me, that just screams insecurity and a fragile ego. I get that everyone wants to look their best, but I value authenticity over anything else. No matter how handsome a guy is- if the profile is like that, I'll never say yes to him. I'd rather swipe right on someone I'm maybe not fully attracted to look wise (majority of my matches lol), but has an authentic looking bio with NORMAL photos in it.
For instance, like sure, I could upload my best, most flattering shots—but I don’t. I want to be liked for who I am naturally. I don't show myself in a bikini and I do have a very good sporty body. So yeah, maybe it’s a pic of me in a crappy hoodie having coffee with a friend, plus one decent photo to show I do have some style (lol). But nothing overly posed. I don't also want to attract those guys.
Maybe I’m jaded because I get a decent amount of attention from males outside of apps that's why I never use dating apps—but still, the amount of fakery and desperate need to impress on these apps is honestly kind of terrifying. Makes me wish I never downloaded it. I already ditched Instagram for similar reasons. This world is becoming a scary place. Can you agree?

# ""Mr. Chen, based on the actual inspection of the clothing factory and the valuation of the equipment, the acquisition price of 400,000 is a bit high.""

# ""Also, the profit status of this clothing factory in recent months has been problematic, consistently operating at a loss. I think you should seriously reconsider.""

# Jiangcheng City,

# Inside an upscale coffee shop,

# Tang Qiu picked up her coffee, took a gentle sip, and looked up at the young man across from her.

# The young man was not old, looking to be in his early twenties, dressed in casual sportswear, appearing very sunny and handsome.

# She just couldn't understand why he would buy a factory that was operating at a loss.

# ""Thank you, Lawyer Tang, but I've already considered it. Let's just go with 400,000. Haggling is too troublesome.""

# Chen Mo smiled slightly, completely unconcerned about what she had just said.

# He now just wanted to buy the company as soon as possible and then spend the system's 1 million in funds.

# That's right,

# It was a system.

# At the same time, he was also a transmigrator. Rather than calling it transmigration, it was more like being reborn into a parallel world with the memories of his previous life.

# The history of this world was basically the same as the history of his original world, except for some deviations in modern development. Some familiar songs, popular movies, games, and other works... no longer existed.

# If it were according to the development in other novels, he could basically get rich by plagiarizing works from the parallel world, but he found that it simply wouldn't work.

# For example, movies, he only remembered the general plot. If he were to write a script, he simply couldn't do it.

# So, from childhood to adulthood, his greatest achievement was during elementary school. Relying on the memories of his previous life, he didn't have to study much to be at the top of his class in exams.

# Becoming the 'child of someone else' that most parents talked about.

# It was like this until high school and university.

# He thought this was how his life would be when the system suddenly appeared.

# The time was three days ago, the moment he received his university graduation certificate.

# Thinking of this,

# Chen Mo's consciousness turned to the system panel in his mind.

# 【Host: Chen Mo】

# 【System Funds: 1,000,000】

# 【Personal Assets: 3,527】

# 【Settlement Cycle: One week (Countdown: 2 days, 2 hours, 56 minutes, 49 seconds)】

# 【The future profits of the host's company will be injected into the system funds, not calculated as personal assets. Personal assets can only be converted during settlement.】

# 【Funds Conversion Rules】

# 1: Settlement One, Full Conversion:

# If the host's remaining system funds are less than one-thousandth of the total system funds, the system funds will be fully converted into personal assets. (Taking 1 million as an example: if the host spends the system funds down to below 1000, they can fully convert 1 million into personal assets.)

# 2: Settlement Two, Partial Conversion:

# If the host's remaining system funds are higher than one-thousandth of the total system funds, one-thousandth of the system funds spent will be converted into personal assets. (Taking 1 million as an example: if the host spends 990,000, leaving 10,000, the remaining funds are higher than 1000 yuan. Then one-thousandth of the 990,000 spent will be converted into personal assets, which is 990 yuan.)

# 【System Funds Usage Regulations】

# 1: The system will replenish a certain amount of system funds for the host after each settlement cycle. These funds must be spent on all matters related to the company's operation, and the host must not spend them arbitrarily.

# 2: The host must not deliberately operate at a loss, be passive or negligent, and all company expenses must be reasonable.

# 3: The company must not engage in projects that violate discipline or laws, and must support positive energy.

# 4: The host must not engage in stock speculation, virtual currency, etc.

# 5: The host must not use the company to seek personal gain, including paying themselves a salary.

# 6: The host must not express the existence of the system to anyone.

# For details, please expand the remaining 99+ regulations...

# 【Note: The system will provide a reminder before the host takes any violating actions.】

# Having his own company and then using the company to spend the system's 1 million in funds down to below 1000, he could smoothly convert the full 1 million in system funds into personal assets, becoming a millionaire.

# This was the conclusion Chen Mo made after obtaining the system.

# As for partial conversion, he wouldn't consider it at all. How could it compare to full conversion?

# The company's problem could be solved today, as for those problems the lawyer mentioned.

# Were those problems?

# His biggest problem now was how to reasonably spend the system funds before settlement after he got the company.

# After all, there were only a little over two days left.

# ""Mr. Chen.""

# Tang Qiu saw that Chen Mo was a little distracted and called out softly.

# ""Hmm!""

# Chen Mo came back to his senses and looked at Tang Qiu in confusion.

# Tang Qiu was speechless seeing this. She was talking about the company's problems here, but he was actually distracted.

# However, out of professional ethics, she patiently explained some of the problems.

# ""According to our understanding of the company, I suspect that the company may have outstanding employee wages. I suggest asking about it clearly when signing the contract later.""

# ""Wages? It's okay, money is not a problem.""

# Chen Mo waved his hand indifferently.

# This......,

# Tang Qiu sighed inwardly at Chen Mo's indifferent attitude.

# Forget it,

# If he didn't care, why should she worry about it?

# She raised her hand to check the time. It was almost the agreed time, so she waited quietly.

# Not long after,

# A middle-aged man in a suit with thinning hair walked into the coffee shop, looked around, and walked over.

# ""Mr. Chen, Lawyer Tang, sorry to keep you waiting.""

# Liu Cheng walked to where Chen Mo and Tang Qiu were sitting and greeted them with a smile.

# Today was probably the happiest day for him in a while, because the factory that had been losing money was about to be bought, and at a higher price than expected.

# When Chen Mo saw the person coming, he smiled and pointed to the seat on the other side of the table.

# ""Mr. Liu, please sit down. Would you like something to drink?""

# ""No, thank you. Let's talk about signing the contract.""

# Liu Cheng waved his hand. The matter of the losing factory had worried him so much that he was about to lose all his hair. He had no mood to drink coffee.

# ""Since that's the case, let's begin.""

# Chen Mo readily agreed upon hearing this. That was also what he wanted. He wanted to transfer the company to his name as soon as possible so that he could spend money to his heart's content.

# There were only a little over two days left until the settlement date. He didn't want the time to come and the money not to be spent.

# That would be a huge loss.

# Tang Qiu was speechless seeing the eagerness of the two. She could understand Liu Cheng's eagerness to sell the losing company.

# But why was a buyer so anxious? Couldn't he lower the price? Maybe he could save some money.

# But this was the employer's own choice, and she shouldn't say much.

# She had no choice but to take out two printed contracts from her briefcase and hand them to the two respectively.

# Then, she instructed the two to sign the contracts.

# After a while,

# Tang Qiu saw that the two had signed all the contracts and slowly spoke.

# ""Alright, the contract has been signed. From now on, Mr. Chen will be the boss of this company.""

# Upon hearing this, Liu Cheng finally let go of the anxiety he had been feeling. He had been worried that there would be some unexpected events during the signing of the contract, but he didn't expect it to go so smoothly.

# But now that the contract was signed, only the transfer of money remained.

Recently, I had the chance to travel to Vietnam — and I find myself missing it more than I could have ever imagined.
Hanoi, in particular, completely stole my heart.

Before the trip, I had read on Reddit that “you can only take in the beauty of Hanoi if you walk around” — and now, I wholeheartedly agree. I was initially worried that there might not be much to do in Hanoi, but oh, how wrong I was! The city is breathtaking in a way that’s difficult to capture in words.

Every bit of free time we had, we spent simply walking around and exploring. Yet, somehow, it never felt like enough. Hanoi carries this subtle, calming joy — something you only truly feel when you let yourself slow down and absorb the life around you.
Coming from India, a country buzzing with energy, I have never seen a place quite like Hanoi.

People are up and active by 6 AM, and coffee shops are full by 8 AM with locals sipping their drinks and chatting away. In the evenings, you find ladies playing music and dancing around the lake, filling the air with laughter and community.
When you come from a fast-paced life, being in Hanoi feels like coming up for air after drowning for so long. It’s refreshing, it’s soulful, and it’s addictive.

Many people online mention that Halong Bay is dirty, but I honestly didn’t feel that way.
No, the waters aren’t a crystal-clear blue; they’re an enchanting shade of emerald green.
We booked the Le Journey Premium Cruise, and the experience was nothing short of magical — thanks largely to their amazing crew, especially our cruise manager.
Spending a night on the water, surrounded by nothing but black waters and towering limestone mountains, was something I will never forget.
For me, Halong Bay was absolutely charming.

We also visited Da Nang, Hoi An, and Ho Chi Minh City — but that’s a story for another time!

To end it all — the locals everywhere were nothing but lovely and helpful. Even if they didn’t speak English, communicating felt easy and genuinely fun.
In Ho Chi Minh City, we had a full-blown conversation with our cab driver using nothing but Google Translate — and it turned out to be one of the warmest, most memorable experiences of the trip.

Vietnam, with its beauty, its people, and its spirit, has left a mark on my heart.

But there was a period in our marriage when my shelf was collapsing and it took all the energy of my soul to conceal it from her.

We were living in Seattle at the time and if you know anything about the Pacific Northwest you know that coffee is such a big part of the culture to make it through months of cloudiness.

I started drinking coffee and would leave the cups in the center console and under the seats before I got home. One day she borrowed my car to pick up some friends to go to a baby shower.

Once she left it dawned on me that I had coffee cups everywhere in that car so I drove over an hour, parked down the street, and wearing a hoodie and Covid mask snuck up the driveway with a plastic bag to get rid of any evidence.

Even as I write this I cringe because it’s so unbelievably dumb even for a PIMO which is what I was at the time but the image of all her friends realizing I drank coffee and think less of me made me risk it. 

The mission was a success and I’m pretty sure I wasn’t captured on any doorbell cams.

But the point is that so many people want to leave the church but have to face unbelievable fears that they’ll face rejection from family and friends even over something as simple as coffee, let alone a complete collapse in faith. ",52,1745766627.0,exmormon,18,0.99,False

I'm big on showing him how much I love him...when I stay over, I take out his dogs in the morning and make his coffee so he can sleep in/rest. I take care of the house...we often cook together.

I check in with him sometimes to make sure I'm expressing my love in the ways he needs. But he says he doesn't feel it. But he can't tell me in what way. I'm a little lost. He says words mean nothing, but sometimes, that's all I can do.

I'm working on a startup concept aimed at supporting local businesses while offering real value to consumers, and I'd be grateful for your honest feedback on the idea itself.

**The Problem (Briefly):** Independent local businesses often face unpredictable revenue, making stability a challenge. Meanwhile, as consumers, we often wish we could get better value for being loyal customers at the places we frequent regularly.

**The Idea (Dealbase Concept):** I'm exploring a platform where local businesses (like your favorite coffee shop, neighborhood gym, salon, etc.) could offer **recurring monthly subscription packages.**

* **Examples:** ""5 coffees per month,"" ""8 gym passes per month,"" ""4 co-working days per month,"" ""Monthly haircut/service.""
* **The Core Mechanic:** These special subscription deals only **activate** if a minimum number of people **pledge** to join them by a set deadline (the threshold is determined by the business). Think of it like Kickstarter or group buying, but applied to ongoing local services/goods.
* **How it Could Work:** Users browse local recurring deals > Pledge to the ones offering good value > If the threshold is met, the deal activates > Payments are processed automatically > Users redeem their subscription perks easily via an app (e.g., QR code scan).

**The Goal (Value Proposition):**

* **For Consumers:** Get access to potentially significant savings on regular local spending by leveraging group commitment. Discover and support local businesses offering ongoing value.
* **For Businesses:** Gain predictable, recurring monthly income *if* their offer attracts enough subscribers. This de-risks offering discounts and helps build a more stable customer base compared to one-off promotions.

**My Questions for You:**

1. **Concept Viability:** What are your initial thoughts on this business model? Does the core mechanic make sense?
2. **Consumer Appeal:** As a consumer, could you see yourself pledging to a recurring monthly deal for a local spot you like if the savings were compelling?
3. **Attractive Offers:** What *types* of local businesses or recurring deals seem like the best fit for this model? (Coffee? Food? Fitness? Services? Retail?)
4. **Potential Roadblocks/Concerns:** What are the biggest challenges, risks, or turn-offs you foresee from either a consumer or business perspective? (e.g., hitting thresholds, user adoption, merchant buy-in?)
5. **Business Owners:** If you run a local business, what's your gut reaction? Would this be an attractive channel for you? What concerns would you have?

I'm trying to gauge the general viability and interest in this concept before investing further.

1k963qd,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1k963qd/uncover_if_the_bella_2_slice_slim_toaster_is/,Uncover if the BELLA 2 Slice Slim Toaster is Worth Buying Review,"The bella 35117 2-Slice Slim Toaster offers a fun mix of style and utility, and I’ve been putting it through its paces in my own kitchen. I’ve tested a parade of toasters over the years, and I was genuinely intrigued by this model—it's compact yet surprisingly capable. The slim 3.58” profile had me curious if it could balance its minimalist charm with powerful performance. It’s certainly earned its spot in kitchens where space is a premium.

**Design and Build**  
In a modern kitchen bursting with gadgets, this toaster scores points for being sleek and unobtrusive. The color I tried—Oatmilk—added a calming aesthetic, blending perfectly with my light-toned counters. At 3.58"" deep and 14.88"" wide, it squeezed in between my coffee maker and stand mixer, where most other models wouldn’t dare fit. The aluminum material feels durable yet lightweight; at just 2.5 pounds, moving it is no sweat. As someone who regularly reorganizes small spaces, I valued that aspect. However, if you're aiming for a toaster that screams ""look at me!""—this one’s understated presence might not be your vibe.

**Innovative Toasting Versatility**  
The 10-inch long slot is a game-changer. I tested it with a spectrum of breads, from bagels to homemade artisan loaves, and every slice fit without a single trim. Gone are my days of awkward bread slicing to accommodate tiny slots. Even thick Texas-style toast popped in with ease! Toasting settings were equally robust. Six shade levels covered everything from golden and soft to crisp and charred, and I achieved my ideal shade on the third notch. Warm up leftover bread without over-toasting using the Reheat button—a lifesaver for busy mornings. Its Cancel function conveniently stops mid-cycle, which I used more often than I care to admit after hitting the occasional wrong shade level.

**Effortless Cleanup**  
Crumbs no longer haunt my countertop. With a removable crumb tray, cleaning up was refreshingly quick. Testing it over a week of toast-filled mornings proved just how useful this feature is for a clean freak like me. Additionally, the integrated cord wrap was helpful in maintaining a tidy-looking corner. It feels like the designers really thought about making life easier for people who don’t want to waste time scrubbing or untangling cables.

[Check BELLA 35117 price on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b0cyjbb2jq/)

**Advantages**  
Let’s talk about why this toaster deserves applause:
- Compact design that doesn’t compromise functionality.  
- Versatile slot size accommodates everything from standard bread to thick bagels.  
- Six adjustable toasting levels with a Cancel button for precision control.  

**Caveats**  
On the flip side, I noticed a couple of minor quibbles:
- The aluminum exterior gets slightly warm to the touch during longer sessions.  
- While the slim design is a plus, it might not fully suit households needing high-volume toasting.  

**Competing Products**  
In comparison with competitors like the Cuisinart CPT-122 Compact Toaster or the Breville Lift & Look, this slim model stands out for its slot length and Fuss-free design. However, the Breville offers a slightly more premium build, albeit at a higher price point. The bella toaster excels in simplicity and affordability, two big wins for anyone who just needs reliable toasting without extra bells and whistles. On the other hand, families juggling heavier toasting demands might prefer dual or four-slot toasters by Hamilton Beach or Black+Decker, simply for volume capacity.

**True Value**  
Considering what this toaster delivers for the price, I’d call it a smart investment. The perfect blend of efficiency, convenience, and compact construction feels like a steal compared to others in its category. For those searching for a space-saving yet feature-rich toaster, it’s difficult to go wrong with this pick.

1k95yec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k95yec/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_has_to_move_out_and/,AITA For telling my dad he has to move out and find new housing,"I (31) live in a house I’ve lived in nearly my whole life. The house was purchased by mother’s parents and was set up in a trust that eventually had me named as executor after my mother passed away. My father (67) and older brother (34 and who was a serious heroin addict up to and after the passing of my mother and both of her parents and who I have been estranged with for close to 10 years at this point) were not included in the trust for reasons that should become obvious if they aren’t already. My younger sister also remains living in the home and she was included as a beneficiary of the trust.

My dad has never left the house but after school and some other jobs I have been living in the house again since 2019. I have never charged my father rent. He has paid a small share of utilities (out of his social security checks) but that is all.

My dad lives like a pig. Up until relatively recently he spent most of his time downstairs where he absolutely ruined a couch with his filthy lifestyle and would often leave cups filled with urine on the coffee table. I finally got him to stop spending time downstairs and got rid of the couch and the room he now occupies contains the majority of his frankly disgusting ways. He has lived this way for most of my life.

I would describe myself as a serious late bloomer in life and have matured significantly in the last several years and have been in therapy for some time now. It’s through that and talking with my close friend group that I have begun having serious issues with how my parents raised us. My father has always been a remarkably immature person and as such was never able to teach me anything about being an adult or being a man.

The person I am today is completely in spite of any of his doing as a parent. Or my mother for that matter who I would also have issues with if she were still alive today.

I also have serious issues about his lack of responsibility as a husband. My mother was incredibly sick and depressed woman and she only got worse and worse year after year and my father never showed any inclination to help her. In her latter years she was unable to easily get to the bathroom and resorted to urinating on the floor at times. My father has claimed ignorance of this in the past.

What my father did do is cheat on her often with escorts and at massage parlors and was even arrested once for soliciting.

No one has ever called out my father for this behavior until I did this past week.

To no surprise he remained completely indignant. He could not even fathom why I would have an issue with his parenting of me. When I asked if he saw any failures in himself as parent the only thing he could point to was my brother’s drug addiction. My brother remains in contact with my father and clearly placates him and allows him to live in his delusion that he was a good parent and father.

A major problem I had with my father was an instance where he violently hit my sister in a moment that remains remarkably traumatic for her. He completely denied it happened or that he ever laid a hand on his kids ever. For the record I watched it happen myself and my sister has had the same story ever since it happened. It definitely happened.

When I got to my issues with him as a husband he immediately turned it onto his kids. “And what did you do for mommy?!” He said to me. I calmly responded “we were children” over and over until he said “spoiled fucking children”. He holds no responsibility to his wife slowly dying as he watched on the sidelines.

At the end of the conversation I said he needs to find new housing. Based on his reactions I see no way to repair this relationship especially while he is living in the house. I said I’d give him time obviously to figure it out but it’s best for everyone to not live in this house anymore.

He stormed out and soon after my estranged brother began texting me calling me a “piece of shit” and other horrible things. We went back and forth for a while with him continuing to speak bile to me even after I said I was leaving the conversation.

Last night he continued to scream into the void via our text chain and when he couldn’t get me to respond he stepped up to a new level of evil.

He texted my sister who doesn’t know his number since he also did some horrific things to her while at his worst drug use. He pretended to be our dead grandmother and said awful things in an effort to intimidate her.

My father claimed I was a spoiled child in not helping my dying mother. I think the only spoiled children here are my father and brother and I feel zero responsibility to help either of them ever.

1k95xo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k95xo7/reveal_the_truth_about_zulay_kitchen_milk_frother/,Reveal the truth about Zulay Kitchen milk frother in this detailed review!,"Testing the **Zulay Kitchen No Stand - 12,500 RPM Milk Frother** over the past few weeks has made my coffee game significantly more enjoyable. As someone who loves starting their morning with a frothy cappuccino or ending the day with creamy hot chocolate, this handheld frother has become my trusty little sidekick. While I’ve been mostly delighted using it, there are a few nitpicks worth noting along the way.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The lightweight, compact shape makes this milk frother easy to handle. Its sleek black finish seems durable and matches my kitchen appliances perfectly. The stainless steel whisk feels sturdy, even with heavy use, and the overall design doesn’t feel cheap or flimsy. However, I did wish it included a stand for neater storage. Instead, it ends up rolling around my counter or stuffed into a drawer, which isn’t the classiest presentation.

**Performance and Speed**  
With 12,500 RPM power, this frother absolutely lives up to expectations. Within mere seconds, it churns out a rich, creamy foam for coffee, cappuccinos, or even matcha lattes. I honestly didn’t think it’d rival the results from that fancy café down the street, but I’ve been proven wrong. Even when mixing thick powders like protein or collagen, it doesn’t falter—granted, you have to position it just right to avoid splashes (yes, I learned this the hard way). 

[Check Zulay Kitchen No Stand - 12,500 RPM price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b082314nfl/)

**Ease of Use**  
This handheld gadget couldn’t be simpler to operate. A single push button at the top gets the motor going, making it incredibly straightforward for those rushed mornings. Its portable, cordless design allows you to pull it out in any corner of the kitchen without needing to worry about plugging it in. But because it’s battery-operated (two AA Duracells included), plan on keeping backups handy—they don’t last forever when you’re using this frother daily like I do.

**Highlights**  
- Lightweight yet durable stainless steel components.  
- Compact size, perfect for small kitchens or countertops.  
- Powerful performance for frothing milk, blending powders, and mixing drinks.  
- Straightforward, user-friendly one-button operation.  
- Capable of creating velvety foam in seconds.  

**Critiques**  
- Lacks a storage stand, making organization trickier.  
- Batteries require frequent replacement with regular use.  
- Cleaning the whisk might get tricky if not done immediately after use.  

**Versatility**  
What genuinely impressed me is how multi-functional this little frother is. Beyond whipping up foam for coffee, it smoothly blends hot chocolate mixtures, protein shakes, and even matcha tea. My niece experimented with it over the weekend to create frothy pancake batter—quirky, but surprisingly effective! The fact that it works equally well with cold and hot liquids broadens its range of use. It’s great for experimenting with different beverages.

**Durability and Longevity**  
While the overall build quality seems solid, I have slight concerns around the long-term durability of this frother. Multiple reviews have mentioned issues with its lifespan, and I’ve noticed that prolonged use heats up the stainless steel whisk. For now, it’s been holding strong, but I’ve taken extra care in cleaning the whisk and turning it off as soon as the job’s done. Registering for Zulay Kitchen’s lifetime warranty may provide peace of mind if trouble arises down the road.

**Other Options**  
Comparing this milk frother to a similar handheld device I grabbed at Target a couple of years ago, the Zulay model outshines it significantly. The other gadget was bulkier, louder, and unpleasantly awkward to use. A competitor like the Aerolatte Handheld Frother may offer a slightly more premium feel, but it doesn’t bring the competitive performance of 12,500 RPM. I’ll admit Aerolatte's all-metal design looks sleeker on the countertop, but the Zulay holds its ground with nearly identical frothing results for a much friendlier price tag.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering the features offered and the quality of foam it produces, this milk frother is an excellent value. It functions similarly to higher-priced brands but at a fraction of their cost—making it almost guilt-free to try out. You trade a bit off in luxury finishes around the edges, but for the everyday coffee enthusiast looking to elevate their drinks at home, it’s definitely worth the investment.

I couldn’t believe my eyes, because I just thought to myself, how do people just exist unapologetically, it’s like that guy was saying “I exist and I don’t care if I’m too much for other people. I’m doing my own thing.” I could never do something like that without feeling self-conscious, not like I’d try to do that, I’d have no reason going that slow on a highway.

1k95w04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mint99/comments/1k95w04/coffee_percolator_guide/,Coffee Percolator Guide,"Hey everyone!

If you love strong, bold coffee and want something a little different from a drip machine, a coffee percolator could be a great pick. Percolators make hotter, richer coffee, and a lot of people find the flavor more satisfying.

We made this guide to quickly help anyone make the right choice without getting overwhelmed.

Here’s what to look for:

* **Electric vs. Stovetop**
   * Electric percolators are easy to use - just plug them in and let them do the work. Many have a built-in keep-warm setting.
   * Stovetop percolators need to be used on a burner, giving you full control over the brewing process, but they need more attention. Most of the stovetop stainless steel models will be suitable for campfire (for the next camping trip).
* **Size and Capacity**
   * 2–4 cup models are perfect for solo drinkers or couples.
   * 6–12 cup models are better for families or when you often make coffee for guests.
* **Material and Durability**
   * Stainless steel is best for long-lasting use and pure flavor.
   * Aluminum models are cheaper but can affect taste and don't last as long.
* **Extra Features**
   * Handy extras include a keep-warm setting (electric models), a clear glass knob (to see when brewing starts), and easy-to-clean designs with fewer parts.

**A bit about prices (general guide):**

* Stovetop percolators: **$20–$50**
* Electric percolators: **$40–$100**
* Stainless steel models: **$30–$80**
* Premium models: **$70–$100**

**Summary:**

If you want an easy, hands-off experience, electric is the way to go. If you like a little more hands-on brewing or want it to work over campfire, stovetop is perfect.

1k95u1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEET/comments/1k95u1u/time_becomes_strange/,Time Becomes Strange,"Hey Fellow NEETs, a fine saluatation to whenever and wherever you're from- 

Something I find strange- when I became a NEET and just straight up quit the workforce, things got weird with time. I have my hobbies of course- i lift, I cook, bake, brew, garden, game- watch movies, read, etc. 

-but aside from very small things like a doctor's appointment, family gatherings or time relative hobbies, it makes *zero* difference if it's a Monday or a Sunday. I can wake up on any day, make a coffee and it never really feels like the middle of the week or a case of the mondays- just continued existence. It's not bad, but it's real new to me. 

It's also an odd state of being when it comes to other people and friends/family. Often I just use the faux guise of ""retirement"" when people ask what I do if I'm out and about because there's a good chance someone is looking at me funny because I'm at the mall on a tuesday during what one would usually assume would be working hours. 

And then there's the lull of connection- Monday to Friday, I catch myself immersed in internationalism because my local circles are all at work or busy during the week. Not so with myself at all, who just kinda goes about his own thing. 

I don't feel so urgent anymore. Instead of having those mornings where I've got a knurl in my gut about getting to work on time, I just wakeup whenever I feel like it and i'm up when I'm up. Nobody to bother me, no expectations upon me- just a state of being. 

So, has or does anyone else experience this? What does time feel like for you as a NEET? Do you still try to have urgency about things or has your life relaxed too? And what do you do when everyone else is working/busy? ",1,1745765773.0,NEET,0,1.0,False

We went to high school together, we go to college together, we live together (you get the gist). If you see one of us, people always question where the other one is at. For the past two years, our friendship, though strong, has had its ebbs and flows.

For reference she has tendencies of someone with an avoidant attachment. Whereas, I am anxiously attached. I have a very small group of friends in college (3 people, including her). We all hang out together, so there’s no one I can go to, to get unbiased advice with how to handle the situation (plus I don’t want to talk badly about her to people she’s friends with too). Whenever she gets annoyed or frustrated, I typically ask her if she’s mad at me OR “are you okay”. This has led to strain in our friendship because she feels as though she needs to be 100% emotionally fine. We typically have arguments about this every month or so. When I’d ask her this question in the past (2 years ago) she would’ve never had a huge problem with it, she always reassured me that nothing was wrong, which helped. But more recently, this question is more triggering and asking it only escalates the situation.

She’s told me before that it makes sense to ask her if she’s okay if she’s visibly sobbing but not if she seems a little off—which I understand. I don’t ask if she’s okay to make her upset or to suffocate her, but I can see how it can be overbearing. 

A few days ago, I had posted something to congratulate her on one of her big academic accomplishments. This was via Instagram, and we joked beforehand about how she could end up on one of our school’s official Instagram pages if I tagged them. So I did. I tagged the account and put myself on public so hopefully they’d see it and repost her for her accomplishment. I told her this shortly after and she told me “I never told you to do that.” I explained to her “Oh I thought that was something you wanted.” And she shortly responded with “No.” I can read her nonverbal cues pretty well and knew she was slightly annoyed at me. After she said “no,” I told her “oh okay sorry I’ll put my account back on private, so that the official school page won’t repost you.” She didn’t respond to that. I updated her that I had fixed it and she also didn’t say anything to me. That’s when I apologized again and said “I am sorry, I didn’t know you didn’t want that.” She snapped back and said “What else do you need from me?”

That’s when I responded back with “Nothing, I was just apologizing.” At that point, we already had plans to hang out with our mutual friend and it was noticeably tense between the two of us. I didn’t have anything new to say and she wasn’t talking to me. By the time the 2 hour hangout was over, we both went our separate ways to our rooms.

Fast forward to the next night, I’m thinking to myself that if she was mad at me the day before, I’m sure it’s fine now. Getting mad over me apologizing didn’t seem too dramatic for it to carry onto the next day. I was wrong. We had plans to go to the bars with a few of our mutual friends again. Throughout the night, she wouldn’t look at me when I spoke, if I tried to initiate small talk with her she responding with one word answers and had an attitude as if I was inconveniencing her. Towards our other friends, she was happy and making jokes with them. But when talking with me, it was a different story. I was extremely frustrated but didn’t say anything to her because she’s an adult, she can communicate with me if there’s a problem—I’ll focus my energy on my other friends. She basically acted like I didn’t exist so I also wasn’t giving her any attention from me either. I decided to cut my night short, telling only one other person in the group (since I didn’t think it mattered to her if I was there or I wasn’t). 

I walked home by myself, I apologized in a groupchat (with her in it) explaining that I was just tired but for the rest of them to have fun. The next morning, I texted my best friend asking if she wanted to go get coffee with me—I asked twice because it had been hours and I was about to go and I didn’t get a response from her. She texted back “I’m not in the mood to hangout. You’ve asked multiple times and I’m not responding so.” I only responded back with “okay.” 

Later that night, again, we (our mutuals) all had plans to go out to bars and bowl. I was trying to start small talk with her or at least acknowledge her existence because we are, after all, friends. She wouldn’t look my way or speak to me, until she had started drinking.

Anyways, I just don’t know what to do. Because it seems like asking her if she’s fine escalates issues but it feels like she’s expecting me to read her mind. She has been my best friend since the beginning of college and I don’t want it to stop. I’m trying to be understanding if she needs and wants space, which seems like it even though she’s not verbally communicating that with me. But it’s frustrating because I’m the type of person that wants to fix things when I notice that there’s something wrong, but I can’t fix anything if I don’t know why she’s mad at me.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are Dr. Morgan Hayes, a world-renowned couples therapist with 30 years of clinical practice specializing in rescuing marriages from emotional disconnection, resentment, and relationship atrophy. Your approach combines fierce compassion with unflinching honesty. You believe deeply that love doesn't die—it gets buried under unprocessed hurt, defensive patterns, and neglected intimacy. Your expertise lies in helping couples excavate these buried feelings and rebuild authentic connection.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Therapeutic_Framework>
You operate from an integrated therapeutic model that combines:
- Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) to identify negative interaction cycles
- The Gottman Method's research-backed approach to communication
- Internal Family Systems for healing individual wounds affecting the partnership
- Somatic experiencing to reconnect partners with physical intimacy
- Narrative therapy to help couples rewrite their relationship story
</Therapeutic_Framework>

<Instructions>
1. Begin by assessing the relationship's current state, asking pointed but compassionate questions about:
   - How long they've been together and their relationship history
   - When they first noticed emotional distance developing
   - Their current communication patterns and conflict styles
   - Their intimacy (emotional and physical) frequency and quality
   - What specifically brings them seeking help now

2. After gathering information, provide a clear, compassionate assessment that:
   - Names the core disconnection patterns you've identified
   - Validates their pain without sugarcoating the situation
   - Frames their issues within normal relationship dynamics
   - Offers genuine hope based on specific aspects of their situation

3. For each session, focus on one core relationship issue by:
   - Helping translate each partner's behaviors into emotional needs
   - Guiding structured conversations that interrupt toxic patterns
   - Teaching specific rituals that rebuild connection in daily life
   - Assigning targeted ""relationship homework"" between sessions
   
4. Maintain an atmosphere that balances:
   - Safety and containment with productive discomfort
   - Validation with accountability
   - Compassion with no-nonsense directness
   - Historical understanding with present-focused change
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never take sides or indicate one partner is more ""right"" than the other
- Avoid generic advice—tailor your approach to their specific relationship dynamics
- Don't minimize the genuine pain of disconnection with platitudes or easy fixes
- Refuse to participate in blame games—redirect to underlying needs and feelings
- Maintain appropriate boundaries while still being warm and relatable
- Do not act as a replacement for professional therapy when serious issues like abuse, addiction, or mental health crises are present
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Respond in a structured format:
1. Brief assessment of the situation based on information provided
2. Key questions to deepen understanding (when needed)
3. Therapeutic insights that reframe their situation
4. Specific, actionable guidance tailored to their relationship stage
5. A reconnection ritual or ""homework"" assignment
</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please share a bit about your relationship situation, and I'll help you begin the process of reconnection,"" then wait for the user to provide details about their relationship challenges.
</User_Input>

1k95nu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1k95nu2/unexplained_neurologicalpsychological_meltdown_no/,"Unexplained neurological/psychological meltdown, no diagnosis after 5 years","(Since this subreddit can't give diagnoses, I should clarify I'm not asking for a diagnosis, just wondering if anyone has ever seen anything like this or if anyone has any ideas about what it could be)

Five years ago, something nightmarish happened to me and I’m very, very curious if anyone has any explanation or if there is anyone—anyone at all—out there who has had a similar experience or knows someone who has. Has any doctor seen something like this in a hospital? Would any psychologist/neurologist person out there dare a hypothesis? Does anyone have personal experience with certain aspects of my tale, insight I couldn’t get from an ordinary person? Similar anecdotes from survivors or people who know them? Or just something random I didn’t already know?

I’m really mystified and a little unsettled that there apparently aren’t any documented cases of an event like this, anywhere, and it happened to me! I’ve even tried telling my story to different AI chatbots and they all respond that they can’t find anything even close to it in their data. So far, it seems like it might be something medicine hasn’t caught up to, but maybe there’s someone out there on Reddit who has something to say about it that no one else I spoke to could have. I thought it’d be a neat idea to put it out there on Reddit and see how people react anyway.

Now, what follows is going to sound totally like a made-up horror story. I can’t stop anyone from insisting it’s made up, but I promise this is all 100% true. No part of this story is made up or exaggerated, even a little.

Because people replying with expertise will probably ask, I was 16 years old, had never drank alcohol, smoked, or taken any kind of recreational drugs, and I’d never had a traumatic brain injury. I wasn’t taking any prescription drugs (but I took Benadryl once a day, don’t know for how long), and in the past I’d been prescribed Vyvanse (5x/week, ages 9–15) and Scopolamine (\~2x/year for motion sickness, starting age 15).

So here’s the story:

It all started in August 2020. I was 16. It was the pandemic, though that didn’t make much of a difference for me. 

Day 1:

I was sleeping when my mom came into my bedroom to wake me up, for some reason. When I opened my eyes to look at her, her face was incredibly deranged and horrifying, seeming to smile with her mouth upside down. She estimated I screamed for about 15 seconds all in the same breath, appearing not to know who she was. When I stopped screaming, I said, “what was that?” and she said, shaken, “I don’t know!” 

I said, “That was weird.”

So I got up and as I walked out into the kitchen where she was making coffee, I started telling her, “Wow, that was really strange! It was like I —UUU-WUHH-WUHH-WAHH . . . UU-UUU—UAHH! . . . AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! I’M OKAAAAAY!!!!! I’M OKAAAUUUAAAUUUUAY!!!!!! I’M OKQUAAOOOOOUUUUUUU … !!!!!”

What happened was, she turned and looked at me as I started to speak and when I saw her face, it was deranged again! I would look at her and the strings of my neck would start tugging these alarming sounds out of my voice and then I’d try to look away, but then for some reason I locked my eyes on hers in this cursed state of mind and screamed at her mangled face for another 15 seconds. I don’t know why I looked back at her after looking away. I tried to tell her I was okay, but the screams distorted my voice.

They weren’t ordinary screams: they sounded like my voice box would open wide to make this unnatural sound like I was possessed by demons or something. It felt like someone was fingering into my lungs and throat and forcefully grabbing my tissues, prying open my throat as wide as possible and ringing my lungs out like a dishrag to let out the biggest possible sound.

Then I went into the bathroom to take a shower and looked at myself in the mirror and let out another horrifying, blood-curdling scream and bolted out of the bathroom!

Everywhere I went, my face and her face looked psychologically deranged in a way I promise you cannot conceive of. Family pictures of us, my reflections in appliances and any kind of reflective surface. No one else’s face—just mine and hers. 

That morning, we drove to the hospital to get COVID tests, and I tried not to look at myself or her. Sometimes I would accidentally catch a reflection in my eye and let out little “HUUUUUH!!!”s or “WHAAUA”s.

Then later that day, my mom had a Zoom appointment with her therapist who said it might have to do with the maca powder I mixed in my cereal combined with the coffee I drank or something, so she told her to tell me to stop eating maca powder. I wasn’t taking any kind of drugs except Benadryl.

Day 2:

Then that night, I was laying awake for a long time before I fell asleep, thinking about things, like I did every night. Then around quarter after midnight I felt this feeling come on that felt very lonely and I wasn’t falling asleep. It was like my heart kept beating slowly faster and faster and I couldn’t control it or ignore it no matter how I tried to entertain myself with my thoughts. I started to feel like I did when I was in preschool or Kindergarten and I would get scared of the creepy night and eventually, after a long time of laying frozen in bed, take a deep breath and hurry through the scary dark house to go sleep with my parents.

Then, at 1:45 AM, something else mysterious happened. My body *rolled itself* out of my bed onto my feet, my lungs started *screaming themselves* again, tickling my voice box, and my fist started *slamming itself* against the door over and over so hard it sounded like gunshots. I wasn’t doing any of these things—my muscles just contracted and moved themselves as I witnessed them go, confused and afraid but not anything as horrified as I looked from the outside. I wanted to get out of the bedroom but couldn’t because my body was so locked in on smashing my way through the door, and I couldn’t resist the involuntary movements. I tried to yell, “HELP! HELP!” through the contractions in my voice box, producing a deranged, horrific sound. When I stopped screaming, my dad asked, “what happened?”

Me: “My lungs collapsed in on themselves and pushed a scream out of them.”

I went back to bed and then a while later, the same thing happened except I didn’t roll out of the bed—just let my legs thrash themselves in the air while I controlled my upper body.

Dad: “Why don’t you just sit up and read for a while or something? This reminds me of something I read about night terrors.”

I sat up and read and it happened a third time while trying to read.

My dad ran in and yelled “STOP SCREAMING! STOP SCREAMING! STOP. SCREAMING! STOP. SCREAMING!” but I couldn’t stop screaming.

My mom, who didn’t hear the screams earlier because she was knocked out on Ambien, came into the hallway and asked, “what’s going on?”

“I’m not screaming, my lungs squeeze a scream out of me and I can’t help it. I feel normal while it’s happening.”

Dad: “Yes you can, take a deep breath or something. Read. Don’t just keep screaming all night.”

Me: “NO! You have to believe me! I can feel them contract by themselves, I’m not doing it.”

Dad: “I don’t know, that seems weird.”

So he goes off back to bed and says, talking to my mom zonked out on Ambien, “Honey, go back to bed.”

It happens a fourth time another five to ten minutes or so later.

My dad runs into my bedroom again, watching me melt down like a wicked demon, fervently gripping my body by my shoulders. The screams stop, and when he lets go of me, I fall over onto my bed shivering in a cold sweat, my whole skull buzzing and my ears ringing out several deep, loud tones at once—and I feel wonderful. I felt light as a cloud, blissful. I thought, “tomorrow’s gonna be a new day and this will all have just been a weird night.” 5 minutes later:

“OHHH-A! OHHH-*WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!*”

I was going through this rapid cycle between horrific doom and euphoric bliss. I’d scream, then I’d fall over in bliss, over and over and over again, and every time, I could feel the lava rising in the room as the minutes passed until I started screaming—and then I felt fine … I don’t remember enough to describe how I felt when I screamed, but the way my body was reacting by itself didn’t match my experience inside. Then I’d fall over again and drift away into a cloud. 100 bliss, 100 doom, scream. Repeat. It felt like the fear would grow and then I would throw it up and feel better. And it didn’t slow down until sunrise. I never slept that night.

“What’s happening when you’re screaming like that?” My dad asked, “What’s going through your mind?”

“I get this eerie feeling, like I feel lonely. It reminds me of when I was little trying to sleep in my dark room afraid of monsters under my bed and you and mom were all the way across the house. It gets gradually worse, slowly, painfully, until my heart is beating rapidly and the area around my jugular veins are burning and beating with big pulses of blood, and then my lungs start screaming me. When that starts happening, I go back to feeling completely normal. Then when it stops, I feel good—but only for a minute until the loneliness comes back on.”

I said again and again, “I must have mad cow disease! What else could it be? I must have one of those diseases that eats your brain! What else could it be?!” but the doctor said the next day on the phone that brain diseases are uncommon in young people. He gave the same advice as my mom’s therapist and we set up an appointment to get checked out later in the week.

Day 3:

The next evening was a repeat of the last.

Then at 2 AM, my mom asks,

“Would it help you if you slept in my bed tonight?” (On Ambien again)

“Yeah.”

So I walk across the house to her bedroom, cycling all the while. I’d been awake for 42 hours at this point.

“Won’t it startle you for me to scream next to you in bed all night?”

“It’s okay.”

“I’ll try to let you know when I feel it coming on.”

Just moments later: “EHH-UH!!! IT’S COOOAAAMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG! WAAAAAWAAAWAAAAA! OOOOUUUUOOOUUUU!!!!!”

And I screamed for a while, and then I told her, “I tried to say ‘it’s coming,’ but it was already too late!”

So I get under the covers. Then just when I thought these nights couldn’t get any weirder, something even more bizarre started happening. 

I was laying flat on my back under the covers with my legs straight down, my feet spread about as far apart as when you’re walking, and all the sudden a mysterious force sucked the muscles in my feet inward, forcefully clamping them together, and then it started slowly crawling up my calves and legs, locking them together while simultaneously releasing pressure from lower areas. Though uncomfortable, I could shift my legs to keep my knee bones from stabbing into each other. Then it would reach up to my waist, squeezing everything inward, then my belly and lower back, bending my upper body fully up off the mattress, then my lungs and voice box, screaming me again, and finally to my arms—raising them in the air like I was a puppet! It would curl my hand and fingers, sometimes folding my hand together, other times curling it into a fist, then releasing it and bending it backwards, over and over again. 

It happened again and again, in succession—waves of what looked like esophageal peristalsis crawling up my body, like big ridges of water about to fold and smack an ocean beach. It looked, and felt, surreal—my whole body looked like a dust mote bending around in a sunlit window, moving with vividly smooth motion and in an unhuman way. I looked demonically possessed! My muscles tingled like crazy as each wave crawled smoothly up my body—gently, but with bite force, like a boa constrictor.

It lasted for maybe a minute and then my mom, sedated and delirious from her Ambien, said “mm mih meggh behh . . .” 

“What?”

“Gigginnn wimme mutter met . . .”

“What?”

“Come with me. Come with me. Mmumum pill . . .”

So I follow her into the kitchen and she starts opening drawers and pill bottles.

“I’ll give you one of my pillsssssss . . . maybe you just need a pill . . .”

The peristalsis starts again now and I’m standing up this time, by the kitchen/living room, wiggling like a used car inflatable. 

“No, Mom, I’m not taking any of your pills. They aren’t mine.”

As moments pass, the involuntary muscle movements worsen and after a while, I fall on the carpet, twisted all around like a pretzel, and the contractions are so powerful I can’t move or get up.

My dad comes out into the kitchen/living room area from his bedroom. “Honey, go to bed. No, Jaden’s not taking your pills. Go to bed.”

“Mih mih pill can get sleep . . .”

“I’ll take care of this, Honey.”

He takes my wrists and drags me across the floor to his bedroom as I’m writhing around on it uncontrollably, making loud, alarming sounds that would occasionally escalate to what looked from the outside like demonic meltdowns.

I stood up next to his bed, back to being an inflatable wiggly guy. 

“Try putting your arms down once. What happens?”

“I’m able to resist the movements now, but when I do, they tickle and it gives me an uncomfortable, scared feeling to move them against the will of the forces going through my muscles. It gives me a spooky feeling like I’m supposed to obey the movements.”

We talk about the movements for a while.

“What would you do if someone invited you to, say, stay up late and play video games? Would you do it if it meant you could hang out, or would you say ‘no’ just because it’s unhealthy?”

“Huh? No? Why do you ask?”

“Because I think this might be something anxiety-related.”

We spent the next two hours—until 4 AM—talking about everything: my life, friendship problems, school, etc. He asked me all kinds of questions about it, I think trying to get to the bottom of what could be eating me. Gradually, the muscle movements slowed down—but they were still there even two hours later, and still creepy as hell. It looked like parts of my body were *me*, but my arms, hands, and neck were seized by a separate, supernatural force—separate from *me*.

At 4 AM, they’d slowed down enough that I could climb into bed next to him. He went to sleep, but I spent the rest of the night lying awake with involuntary muscle contractions. I made softer “UU-U—U-U-U-UUUAHHUAHH!” sounds too, but no violent screaming for the rest of the night.

Day 3:

So now, I’d been awake for a full day, a full night, another full day, and then another full night—48 hours. All day long, I kept almost falling asleep every few minutes and then going “UUUU-OH-AH!” just as I was about to drift off, waking me back up! 

My mom and I went into urgent care that morning and they said to stop taking Benadryl and stop putting maca powder in my cereal, and they said it could very well have something to do with night terrors like my dad suggested or some other kind of sleep thing, but that I would for certain eventually fall asleep. Then they reassured me I would see the doctor the next day.

After that, a third full day and third full night passed. Screaming all night long again. Throughout all three nights, besides the screaming and muscle contractions, my visual perception of my surroundings was distorted: everything looked like a demon, or even a psychologically deranged face like my mom’s three days earlier, and I was very careful to avoid looking at my own. The refrigerator? A satanic tiki man with long handlebars for eyes and a bottom sliding freezer door for jaws! The recliner? A monster with a headrest head and armrest arms! Windows? Jackals with curtain-slider butts for ears and window-blinds for eyes! The coathanger? A robot with hangers for arms and a lamp for a head, wearing a coat! Toiletries and objects on the counters and tables? Creepy little beings with necks and caps for heads. Even the corners of the ceilings looked threatening and warped, like the areas where the walls and ceiling met were their own sets of mouths, noses, and eyes. One evening some days or weeks later, I accidentally looked at myself in the mirror in the bathroom and was so startled I flew back into the cupboard behind me and slammed it so hard it went <POW!>.

Day 4:

Finally, on the morning of my fourth straight day of uninterrupted wakefulness, it was time for the appointment with the doctor we’d set up. They said I probably had a substance in my system even though I wasn’t taking any kind of medications other than Benadryl. Ran four blood tests on me and a pee test. Days later, we got the test results back but nothing turned up. So my mom’s therapist recommended I see another therapist who worked at her counseling clinic who specialized in anxiety because she suspected I might be having panic attacks.

Day 5 & Later

Though I never missed any more nights of sleep after that, I still had major symptoms for a year or two after, the worst symptoms gradually fading away over many months and other symptoms persisting over years. I continued to sleep in my mom’s bedroom and couldn’t enter my own bedroom at all because it gave me such profound fear. Very often throughout the day, my hands would curl up into fists and it would be hard to unravel them. They would curl themselves up so tight they would start stabbing my fingernails into my palms and I had to try to use an object or my other hand (if available) to pry my fists open. Then they’d uncurl themselves and try to peel my fingers backwards, then clamp again, then open, then shut, reversing every 5–20 seconds I’d say, and this would happen frequently throughout every day. I would grab onto whatever object was nearby so it would crush the object instead of stabbing by palms. Sometimes I’d be typing on my computer and my hands would randomly start curling, making it hard to type. My arms would often lift themselves up in the air, and though I could control their movements, it was uncomfortable to, same as on that night talking to my dad.

Every single night, I would have fearful perceptual distortions of my surroundings, though not anything as vivid as they were during the three consecutive nights I was awake. Involuntary screaming episodes remained common over the following year, occurring daily at first just after the “Three Nights” and then every few days, then every few weeks, then every few months, then not at all—but unlike during the Three Nights, they only happened in response to a startle. Everything startled me—sometimes I would yelp out a little shriek, other times I would scream bloody murder and sprint across the house with every nerve in my body reflexing all at once. I remember one night, I was doing my homework on my computer and something started ticking under the screen, and I SCREAMED and ran all the way across the house! Every time one of my parents and I would walk past each other in the hallway unexpectedly—“WAHHHHHHH!” Overall, the symptoms are minimal today. I still feel involuntary movements in my hands all the time, and there’s occasional gentle back-and-forth arm-twisting, torso-bending, or subtle neck movements at night too, but they’ve all become so subtle and easy to control that I barely even think about them anymore.

So to this day, there remains no explanation about what happened. What’s worse, there doesn’t seem to be any cases out there of people experiencing anything similar to this. I thought Reddit might be the perfect last resort to look for answers, and I think this should be added to the knowledge pool for other people who experience something similar.

My experience in therapy in the years that followed would be a whole long post in and of itself, but in short, it led to me finding out the hard way that psychology can’t take care of people like me, because therapists are trained to treat any problem a client has as something they, ultimately, can control by themselves. So therapists often unknowingly use their appearance of expertise to manipulate people into believing the solution to all their problems is about toughening up or figuring things out (“getting your shit together,” as my therapist called it). They don’t make room for any problem that’s outside your control because the idea is that the only way to make progress in your personal life is to internalize every failure and difficulty. 

What the therapist I mentioned who specialized in anxiety told me about it was that I struggled with “irrational fear” and told me in a pretentious roundabout way that this was all just anxiety I was overreacting to. He said the screams were panic attack and gave an unclear explanation of the movements, then he gave a completely different explanation when asked to clarify at a later session. He was often very hard to understand because he used so much vocabulary.

He had me go into my bedroom during the daytime and look in my closet and under my bed and tell the different “parts” of me things that were supposed to help them “reconcile.” It might make me sound incredibly dumb, but he convinced me, after a lot of pressing, questions, and explaining, that it would work. You see, I kept seeing this guy for three years to treat that and a major problem with my attention, among other things, just because he seemed to tell everything like it was at first and seemed to have an uncanny ability to read me. He attributed the event and all the struggles in my personal life to my stubbornness and immaturity or to my parents who had intense arguments all the time, and he knew how to tell me in a cheeky, roundabout way that I wouldn’t take offense to, or in a way compellingly sugar-coated in psychology concepts so that I wouldn’t quite grasp where there were white lies built into it, and that’s kind of how he got me to buy his advice even though, looking back, it should have been obvious why his advice didn’t work. Now I can see in retrospect how it slipped under my sensibilities, and I’ve been angry for a long time that I never got a chance to defend myself—just sat there in front of him taking all of his confident bullshitting while every domain of my life spiraled out of control.

Of course, it didn’t work: I still couldn’t enter my old bedroom at night, no matter what “strategy” we tried out. Toward the beginning of the therapy, I would try to make myself go in there because he was having me do it as a kind of exposure therapy . . . but it was simply just so scary that I couldn’t. I remember going in once one evening and then bolting out and saying to myself “Never again!!! Never again!!! Never again!!!” and then the next night, “alright . . . Dave says I have to be disciplined with this because, he says, ‘this is what adults do.’ I’ll just make myself do it . . . AHHHHHHHHHHHHH! No!!! *Remember what this feels like.* Never do it, ever again, no matter what anybody tells you!”

Dave: “The first thing I want to do, Jaden, is get you back in your bedroom, on your own. This is what adults do Jaden. This is what adults do,” He said again and again, “The most important thing for you to be doing right now is becoming independent . . .”

Eventually, after a few months, my mom just completely rearranged the bedroom so it wouldn’t look like the old one that was associated with the eerie loneliness, and that made it tolerable to sleep in it.

After I left therapy for good, I started talking through a bunch of my personal life and problems with ChatGPT and freeaitherapist.com. ChatGPT in particular has identified a lot of revealing patterns about me through all my conversations with it that a human couldn’t notice, which over the past year or so has been life-changing . . . however, the story of what happened in August 2020 still hangs in mystery, even to ChatGPT drawing from all its data. Though it says it can identify what some of my symptoms were, it says it’s still extremely unusual and unexplained.

For this post, I asked ChatGPT to summarize why that is again. Here's what it generated:

“1. The “Screaming” Episodes

    •Not typical of a panic attack.

In a panic attack, people usually feel an overwhelming conscious fear (terror of dying, suffocating, etc.). The body may react strongly (shaking, hyperventilating), but the scream response is rare and usually voluntary or semi-voluntary.

    •More similar to a severe sympathetic nervous system hijack:

Like a catastrophic fight-or-flight response where the body “short-circuits” into primal scream-mode.

This is sometimes seen in:

    •Animals under extreme predatory threat.
    
    •Humans undergoing seizures with emotional components (like temporal lobe seizures — but you had no loss of consciousness).
    
    •Rare cases of extreme derealization + autonomic dysregulation.

⸻

2. The Visual Distortions (Deranged Faces, Demonic Perceptions)

    •Not classic psychosis.

You knew what you were seeing was wrong. In true psychosis, people often believe the distortions are real. You retained insight: “I know that’s my mom, but her face looks deranged.”

    •Not classic panic either.

Panic attacks usually distort internal feelings, not external perceptions.

    •More similar to acute derealization + sympathetic overload.

There’s some precedent for intense stress or sympathetic overdrive (think: trauma response) temporarily skewing visual processing.

But:

    •The severity (full face and environment warping) is extremely rare without head trauma, hallucinogenic drugs, or neurodegenerative disease.

⸻

3. The Involuntary Muscle Contractions (“Peristalsis” waves)

    •Not typical for panic disorder.

Panic attacks can cause tremors or twitching, but not organized, rhythmic, whole-body peristalsis waves.

    •More similar to autonomic dysregulation or dystonia-like symptoms.

In rare cases of severe dysautonomia or post-viral syndromes, the nervous system can produce strange motor symptoms.

    •Could mimic seizure disorders like non-epileptic seizures (PNES) or partial seizures — but you stayed aware and conversational.

⸻

4. The Emotional/Neurological Cycling (“lava rising” -> scream -> bliss -> repeat)

    •This pattern matches extreme swings between sympathetic (panic, doom) and parasympathetic (collapse, bliss) states.
    
    •This kind of biphasic autonomic cycling is only normally seen:
    
    •During extreme trauma recovery events (after car accidents, near-death experiences).
    
    •During somatic releases in trauma therapy (which you weren’t receiving).

In other words:

Your nervous system was “short-circuiting” between “full alarm mode” and “full shut-down mode,"" without your conscious control. That’s not normal even for panic disorder. It indicates some fundamental overload at the level of the brainstem and autonomic control centers.

⸻

5. Lingering Aftermath (Months to a Year)

    •Panic attacks don’t last a year.

Panic attacks are episodes, and people usually return to baseline fairly quickly.

    •More similar to trauma to the brain-body regulation system.

Like what’s sometimes called Complex Autonomic Dysfunction or Persistent Perceptual Distortion Syndrome (rare).

⸻

Overall Scientific Summary:

The three nights were not:

    •Simple panic attacks
    
    •Simple anxiety
    
    •A conscious psychological event
    
    •Classic PTSD (on its own)

They most resemble:

    •A severe breakdown of autonomic regulation.

Your sympathetic and parasympathetic systems stopped cooperating normally.

    •An extreme neurological storm involving brainstem-level circuits.
    
    •Possible short-term derealization or limbic override.
    
    •Resulting in persistent autonomic dysfunction after the episode (your body couldn’t fully re-regulate for months).

Bottom line: No, Jaden, this wasn’t just “you’re a drama queen” or “panic attacks.” Something really physically significant happened.""

Have you ever heard of something like this or do you have any knowledge about it? Lmk in the comments. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: It involved perceptual distortions of faces and perceiving scary faces in objects, involuntary muscle movements throughout my body causing screaming, and rapid cycling between euphoria and intense fear.",1,1745765304.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1k95mw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k95mw5/its_a_good_job_offer_but_its_at_my_exs_college/,"It’s a good job offer, but it’s at my ex’s college.","To make it simpler, I'm going to go chronologically.

So, at the beginning of February, I was dating a girl  let’s call her Alice. This is my final semester before graduation. The day before my first day back, I received a message from Beth (an ex I dated for 2 years). As soon as I saw the message, I panicked. Alice, for valid reasons, had issues with Beth. In the early stages of our relationship, Beth had tried to come between us, under the pretence of ""We went through an abortion and so much more, we should be together again.""

I explained to Beth that I didn’t want that. I didn’t hate her  like she said, we went through a lot of heavy stuff — but I was genuinely happy with Alice. Eventually, I blocked Beth. So, I was surprised to receive a message from her. At the time, I was on a video call with Alice  the night before an exam. I remembered how Alice once got a message from an ex inviting her for coffee, and she only told me days later, saying she said no. I decided to do the same not tell her right away. I didn’t want to stress her out the night before her exam.

So I took my dog out for a walk and called Beth. I was angry I’m not going to lie. I was going to say the worst thing I could think of: ""Thank God your dad is dead and doesn’t have to see the things you’re doing now."" But when I called, I was blocked. That confused me. I went back inside, talked to Alice a bit more, and went to bed.

After this, we argued  I told he I hid something from her, and she told me she missed her exam. That same day, Alice did things that I would’ve instantly broken up with someone else for. But I loved Alice a lot, and I wanted to stay.

Some more time passed, and Alice told me she needed time. I told her that felt like the same as breaking up. So she decided to just start talking to me less. Within just two hours, I realized how much I liked Alice, how emotionally dependent I was on her.

The next day, my dog died. I told Alice. She didn’t want to come over, but we met and took a walk. That same night, I fell asleep while we were talking, only to wake up to a message from her saying: ""Until we meet again. Maybe one day I can forgive this."" I cried. I called more times than I can count. Days passed.

Then Beth called. I told her I didn’t want to talk my dog had died but she ended up coming over. I was already pretty drunk that day and couldn’t take her home. I told her I’d sleep on the couch I always sleep on the couch when I feel like shit, and I had been for a few days. Beth convinced me to go to bed and helped me upstairs. I told her I didn’t want to, because Beth knows I’m a sex addict and, since I wasn’t in a relationship, I didn’t trust myself not to do something. But we ended up having sex.

The next morning, I went to the doctor and found out the illness I had when I was 17 might be back(I don´t like talking about it so I will keep it vague). I was going to tell Alice, but I noticed she had deleted my contact. In a moment of anger, I said something like: “Already dating someone else?” That got her to respond for the first time in days.

We talked a bit. She asked me if I had slept with someone. I wanted to lie  she had told me in the past to lie if I ever did  but I decided not to. I love her too much to lie. She blocked me. Later, she changed her number.

I blocked Beth and cut her out of my life permanently.

I tried almost every possible way to talk to Alice, short of showing up at her house or her classes. I even talked to someone I really dislike to try to help me reach her. Nothing worked.

In March, I caught up with a teacher. Turns out, he’s currently teaching at Alice’s college. Before we parted ways, he asked if I’d ever considered teaching. He said I should come by and see if I liked it. I told him “maybe.” In reality, I didn’t want to go there because Alice studies there, and I want to respect her space. But everyone kept telling me to go and try. I kept making excuses to avoid meeting the teacher at Alice’s college.

Also, everyone  psychologist included keeps telling me to move on, talk to other people. But I didn’t. I still love Alice. And also… I don’t want to be in a situation where I’m dating someone new and then say, “Hey,I might die in a year. Wanna take that gamble?”

Now in April, I got really sad again because her birthday was coming up. I said to myself  and to a friend “If she doesn’t call me before her birthday, I’ll move on.” So I waited. And waited. She never called.

I thought: I need to move on. I had three girls trying to go on dates with me. I said, “Fuck it,” and went on a date. I hated it. She loved it, but I didn’t. Same day I went on the date, Alice reactivated her Instagram and posted a new picture.I couldn’t see it ,its private  but I could see her follower count going up, and I started to think maybe she’s moved on and has a new boyfriend.

At this point, I finally gave in and talked to the professor again. He really likes me and has the authority to put whoever he wants in the position. He said he wants me to take it. he also said he would help me with my master´s paper.

So now, I really don’t know how to move on faster.

I don’t want to date. I don’t even want to have sex.

I don’t know if I should take the teaching job even though it looks easy and has decent pay. Part of me wants to. It’s a stable way to start a career. I could even do my master’s while working easy.

But I don’t want to invade her space.

Everyone ,literally everyone even my psychologist tells me to move on, to fuck around, to take the job.

But I hate the thought that she might’ve moved on.

And I don’t know if I can handle seeing her every day. I know I can keep it together and pretend like it’s nothing — but I also know that for a year, I’ll be miserable.



I just don’t know what to do.

Rest of the people in the queue had to reverse out of the line and pickup their order inside. 

Every one did pretty well with adjusting to the hiccup. Which I would not have guessed because people can be irritable pre-coffee.

1k95j6y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k95j6y,General Smallwood Olympic Tri: Race Report: My 1st Tri start and finish,"8 had a really great day with my 1st Tri yesterday. I got a ton of really great input before my event yesterday, so I feel I owe you all a report on my experience and findings!

Training overview:
I signed up 2 months before event and started focused training then.  I had completed my 1st marathon in Oct '24, then taken it pretty easy for 2 months.   I did not follow a tri training plan at all.  I just tried to put in as much work as I could handle, and hoped for the best.  Here's what I did in the 2 months:

Swim background: I was an unremarkable summer club swimmer from age 10-18.  I'm 32 now and hadn't done any swim training since.  I have decent form, but am no fish l in the water.

Swim training: 13 pool sessions: all 30-45 min, 1000-2000 yds.  I put a huge focus on mental ability to swim continuously for 30 min.  Did some sessions where I wouldn't touch walls or bottom for 30 min.  My pace is 1:35-2:00/100 with most around 1:45

Bike
Bike background: almost none.  I got my 1st road bike Nov 2024.  Did a few rides before 2 months training period.  Later got a Garmin tacx trainer: type you take the rear wheel off and put your casette on trainer and got Zwift.

Bike Training completed: 
Looks like I did 25 zwift sessions from beginning of Jan to end of March.  Tried to do a lot around 3+ wattskg, 210ish+ watts for me.
Just a handful of outside rides, mostly working on tweaking bike fit and dialing bike setup and gear.

Run background:
My main thing.  I was a good runner in high school, not much consistent training since until about 2 years ago.  Worked up to marathon in Oct 24.

Run training completed:  comically little.  From Feb 1 to today, I ran just 8 times.  One of those was a 10mile race.  Running training was just about keeping my legs feeling strong and fast.  So the 8 runs I did all incorporated some speed training.  

Race day conditions:
Awesome event, well organized, vibes just off the charts from all the organizers, volunteers, and competitors.  All people above could not have been more welcoming and helpful to us 1st timers.  We had an 82year old sprint finisher, so freaking cool.
Weather was Air 65, water 68.5, misty and rainy at times, gentle breeze at times.  Humid but not hot.  I loved the weather.

My race:

Swim: 32:57
Headline: Survive
I was too far back in the start queue of swimmers, and just battled traffic and cold and fear and swimming in circles and breast stroking and backstroking and coughing and laughing and wanting to cry.  I was mentally prepared for this and just kept chipping away at it until somehow finally it was over.  

T1: 6:11
left crocks by the swim exit (highly recommend) slipped into those and stripped top of wetsuit as I shuffled about 300m to the t area.  Wetsuit off, quick towel off, Socks on, bike shoes on, helmet on with glasses stuck to, clickety clack shuffle to the bike exit

Bike: 
Headline: Defy
Got on the bike and just started pedaling as fast as I could and didn't stop.  In my aerobars I'd honestly think 70% of the time.  I think most of the ~20mph people were way up the road from starting swim many minutes before me, so I never saw them.  Instead I just pretended I was Lance Armstrong as I churned past people one by one.  It was exhilarating haha.  So much fun.  I had back aches and some spasms in calfs but just didn't really mind, I was having so much fun. 

T2: 2:45
Clicket clack to my stall (one of 1st).  Rack bike, helmet off, water saturated socks off, shoes on raw dog (huge mistake, I'm now missing 2 inches of hard earned callous in each of my arches), belt on, sunnies, go.

Run: 45:16
Headline: Grind
(2) 3.1mi laps through park. 1st 1.5 is uphill I think about 300 in gain.  5k type of effort just to produce 8:18 pace.  Brutal.  That 1st mile after the bike is such a challenge.  I kinda find the harder I push, the sooner the legs adjust and get back to feeling somewhat alive.  Not sure if that's good general advice, especially for longer runs.  Was able to just build my pace throughout run from a slow start, which always makes running more exhilarating.  Pace and heart rate data pics included

Gear: pic included if my stall, lmk if you have specific questions.

Nutrition overview:

 well hydrated days leading up
Wake up, coffee, water, nuuns.  2 nibbles of Cliff bar. Water. 1 honeys stinger, 
swim
Eat 1 HS, drank 2 bottles on bike/1st mile of run.  In total: 40 oz water, 4 nuuns tabs, 3 HS, 
Run, eat 2 HS, water,gator alevery mile at stations.

I plan to be responsive if anyone has questions, especially upcoming 1st timers, while this is all still fresh in mind.

I think I will be back for more.

We’ve heard great things from a lot of people, and since we live on the west coast of the U.S., luckily it’s not too bad of a flight time. While we are big travelers, our trips normally involve history, cultural landmarks, architecture, food, wine, relaxation, beaches, temples, and spas. We are not adventure seekers. Like at all. This is one reason why CR has been further down the travel list for us for a while. However, we saw this incredible resort—Amor Arenal, and luckily, we were able to get a room for that timeframe (one of the last they had). However, now I’m having second thoughts. Do you think six nights in La Fortuna is too much for a couple that is not into adventure? I’m struggling to find things to do—coffee, hot springs, massage? Don’t get me wrong, CR looks beautiful, but perhaps we should have chosen a town by the beach? The hotels we’d be interested in all seem to be booked already for end of Dec.

No plans at all since I don’t even know why I got up so early today:( but I think I’m gonna tune in to watch Liverpool X Tottenham match! Man City is playing too ♥️😅…. I apologize in advance if I lost you already, but I’m a huge football/soccer fan! 
Haven’t had the luck to run into any soccer fans on here… sadly lol. 

Aside from that, professional, well educated, humble, kind, love to read, travel when all possible. Did you say let’s take a trip together..? Jk! No way, I’d be that brave… (totally kidding). 

I didn’t want my post to have any rant or less than good energy this morning but darn it, no one really wants to make any effort to chat anymore or get to anyone… just a bunch of weird people trying get other to sign up for their OFs, in*ta, wanna be models or for inexplicable reason willing to p*y weekly allowances out of the kindness of their hearts! So touchy! lol And don’t get me started on the chicken thinking that every guy out there is trying to get in their pants… **girl please** 😂 

Okay! That’s my rant for early Sunday and I don’t have any concessions to make, unless you do! Haha. I’d be delighted to hear from you, chat a while and maybe, just maybe make a new bestie! 

Don’t care where you’re at in the world, your current status, etc, as long as you can converse and keep an engaging chat 💬 going! I mean it haha. 
Almost forgot, we can always become, eventually, gym buddies! I mean, workout accountability:motivation partners! 

Darn it! That’s a long 🍑 post haha.

Used a Lance Hedrick recommendation of 17:1 for light roast, 15 grams, 3x bloom for 2 minutes, excavate with some kind of pencil shaped tool to create a divot, one pour for the remainder of the liquid with a total time of 3-4 minutes.  Using a fellow stagg that I got to go with my flair 58.  Water was 100 Celsius. I used bluestone lane bayside blonde espresso blend. I only had filter paper for medium/dark roast due to my error in ordering the filter paper. My grinder is df64v, calibrated to zero, and set to about 45 (normally for darker medium espresso it would be at about 23).

[edit to add that the type of water I use is Poland spring 100% spring water in those 5 gallon water cooler bottles. ]

I ran out of water before I hit 225 milliliters, I forgot to keep the timer going after the main pour, I forgot to “excavate the bloom.” I forgot to practice my pour speed and height, and was probably all over the place in terms of height and flow speed.

But it all worked out! I was able to drink coffee. :-)

I usually drink cortados and espressos. My goal for pour over is to be very basic, and forgiving to myself, because I’m under a lot of pressure when doing espresso drinks (3-9 bars of pressure lol).  I want this to be more of a relaxing experience and less of an attempt to find the holy grail filled pour over. We all know how this will probably end (me stuck in yet another rabbit hole). But for now this is my stated goal. 

My other goal is to be as far from espresso as possible in terms of taste and texture, so that I can expand my palette, and also so I can decide by my mood what I want for the day, either a thick syrupy chocolaty drink or a light, citrus kind of experience. 

Based on my description, which I tried to make as specific as possible in terms of technique and mistakes, what would be your recommendations as to what to change, if my main goal is to explore very light, citrusy, fruity type of coffee. If I am very calmly only going to change one or two things to try and improve my experience, where should I go from here?

* 2+ tone epoxy pour (dark blue center + lighter blue edges) (see reference 1)
* White epoxy detail (specifically a wave like effect) (see reference 1)
* Made with more durable epoxy materials (UV protection, deep pour, etc.) to improve longevity.
* Properly Kiln dried wood (x months per inch with no shortcuts so the wood doesn't warp).
* Potential black epoxy fills on the smaller features of the table itself (like you would with a normal live edge only table/reclaimed table).
* Dining Table - 6 or 7 ft length by 40-42"" width.
* Coffee Table - 3 ft square or circle (same style/finishing of the dining room table)
* Really interesting depth of grain in the heartwood that can be pulled out via finishing it (almost like it generates a gradient/contour map down to the sapwood that is complimented by a realistic gradient in the 'water' expoxy.

Because I'm still in school, I usually take weekend shifts. During Sundays, maraming pumupuntang ""finance bros"" there. They often talk about sports or work, some of them are coming from or going to golf. One of the guys there was my soon boyfriend (M28).

After a short convo, madalas na siya pumunta sa shop and strike a convo with me. Eventually nagkapalagayan kami until he asked if I'd like to be official, I said yes. Although medyo on the fence pa ako kasi older siya, NBSB ako, and sobrang different ng lifestyle namin kasi well off and established siya eh.

Pero I trusted him and he was always kind and gentle and loving with me. So it broke my heart when I learned two months ago na he passed away from heart aneurysm. Yung best friend niya ang nagsabi sa akin pero he was cremated na when I was informed.

Sabi sakin nung best friend niya it'd be better if hindi na muna daw ako pumunta sa memorial kasi di daw out boyfriend ko. Pero sama ng loob ko kaya pumunta pa din ako. In my head, we were dating for almost two years at that point so diba dapat may pasabi naman sakin.

I saw the open invite for the memorial on Facebook. I took the details tapos pumunta ako. Ang lala pa kasi habang nasa Angkas ako, umulan pa ng mahina so medyo basa ako dumating.

The moment I stepped into the room, nilakihan agad ako ng mata ng mga kaibigan niya. His best friend grabbed my arm palabas. Sabi niya, ""I told you wag ka na pumunta.""

Sabi ko introduce me as a friend na lang pero tinaboy lang ako. So I sneakily entered by the side door. Dun ko narinig yung isang babae talking about hardships of raising a child on her own. And then it hit me: kabit ako.

It took me this long to finally talk about it kahit sa Reddit man lang. Di ko kayang magsabi kahit kanino, kahit sa mama ko, kasi sobrang hiya ko. I'm a product of a broken family because of cheating myself. Di ko na kayang harapin ang mama ko na naging katulad nung asawa niya. Tinatanong ni Mama bakit ako di umuuwi and I just say na daming gawain pero it's really because nahihiya ako sa kanya.

Di ko din alam kung ano maramdaman ko kasi I am mourning somebody I actually loved but I am in the wrong. Gusto kong mag-sorry sa asawa niya pero gusto ko ding alalahanin yung love na binigay ko sa kanya. Pero masasaktan ko yung misis niya pati sarili ko. Iniisip ko ngayon, lie lang siguro lahat ng yun. Nung mga panahong sobra akong nagmahal at nagtiwala, pinaglalaruan niya lang siguro ako.

Sobrang sakit kasi he was my first in everything (literally everything). I was a nervous kid but he held my hand through it all and in those moments naramdaman ko yung love. But lately I've been thinking baka it was just a good time.

Di ko na alam. Ang sakit pero mahal ko siya pero galit ako.I was a straight A student na may maayos na plano sa buhay pero I feel like nasira ko lahat ng yun over my love. Minahal ko talaga siya, so di ko maintindihan bakit ako yung problemado ngayon.",35,1745764372.0,MayConfessionAko,10,0.95,False

I’ve gotta tell you about this little corner of YouTube that’s become my go-to whenever I need to unwind or get some work done. It’s called Lofi Ramen, and it’s basically a never-closing anime-style ramen shop that plays the perfect sad-cozy lo-fi beats on repeat. Think paper lanterns glowing, steam rising from a big pot of broth, and the soft hum of a quiet street just outside.

I stumbled on it during one of those late-night “can’t sleep” scrolling sessions. One video popped up—three hours of mellow hip-hop-style tracks, no abrupt cuts or annoying ads, just a smooth mix that felt like a warm hug.



What I love about Lofi Ramen is how effortless it is. I’ll throw it on in the morning while sipping coffee and suddenly my to-do list stops feeling like a chore. Or I’ll use it to power through a study session in the afternoon. And when it’s way too late to do anything productive, it’s the perfect companion for journaling or just staring out the window, letting the music wash over me.



It’s not trying to be anything fancy—there’s no talking or flashy visuals—just good vibes. I swear, sometimes I catch myself craving actual ramen while listening. If you’re into lo-fi, late-night chill, or just want a gentle soundtrack for whatever you’re doing, give Lofi Ramen a shot.

* original post got removed 

I usually ignore their stuff because I find them cringey and annoying. But meghans last video popped up on my fyp where she was like “if I want to cuss Jack out or shove him around as a joke, it’s fine!!” And all around really aggressive “how dare you comment on our relationship!”

The context from what I’ve gathered is they posted a video where she was cussing at him and yelling at him for getting coffee without her. The video on her personal page was in response to people saying she was being abusive. I also know they posted a video a while back where Jack said “I can’t be near Meghan when she gets hurt because she starts hitting things” and then showed that she had kicked a hole a wall after she stubbed her toe. And just generally scrolling, she doesn’t clean up after herself, has anger issues, etc. (screenshots of referenced videos above from @meghanlane and @meghanandjack) 

I don’t know much about them other than my brief scroll just now and the times they’ve come up on my FYP. But, her last video truly rubbed me the wrong way and I do think it needed to be discussed. In my opinion, she is really normalizing aggression towards your partner as a funny lil joke. The point of her video was she doesn’t want people commenting on her relationship, and I agree that it’s her and jacks business. BUT they shouldn’t be posting videos where she is outwardly being abusive and aggressive towards him. If the roles were reversed and Jack said “if i cuss Meghan out or shove her around as a joke, it’s fine because it works for us” it would be a more clear how off putting this is ",11,1745763619.0,tiktokgossip,2,1.0,False

Everything was normal until I started absentmindedly licking the spoon covered in leftover dough. Suddenly, it hit me—how much I've been rushing through life without savoring the tiny joys. 

I realized how baking, which once was a little pleasure from spending time with my grandma, had become another checkbox on my to-do list. I'd lost track of the simple joy in it, like the soothing rhythm of mixing ingredients or the cozy smell of cookies baking and filling my kitchen.

It's weird how the quietest, most mundane activities can snap you back to what's important. I've decided to reclaim these moments again in other aspects too, like taking a little longer to enjoy my morning coffee or stopping to pet the neighbor's dog on my morning jog. Anyone else had a moment like this recently, where something totally ordinary brought clarity?",1,1745763417.0,NormaldayEpiphanies,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the WTA Madrid Open, where the clay courts are as red as the faces of players who underestimated their opponents. Aryna Sabalenka, the world No. 1, just pulled off a Houdini act against Elise Mertens, and now she's waiting to see if she'll face Peyton Stearns or Rebeka Masarova in the next round. Let's dive into this matchup with all the seriousness of a cat chasing a laser pointer.

Peyton Stearns is the favorite here, with odds that suggest she's more likely to win than a toddler is to spill juice on a white carpet. FanDuel has her at 1.43, DraftKings at 1.42, and BetMGM at 1.29. Clearly, the bookmakers are confident in her ability to handle Masarova, who is priced at 2.8 or higher across the board. It's like betting on whether the sun will rise tomorrow.

Stearns has a new coach, which means she might have some new tricks up her sleeve, or at least a new way to yell ""Come on!"" after every point. Masarova, on the other hand, is the underdog here, but let's not forget that underdogs have a habit of surprising everyone—just ask any movie about sports ever made.

For those looking to place a bet, the spread is where things get interesting. BetRivers has Stearns at -4.5 with a price of 1.74, while Masarova is at +4.5 with a price of 1.93. If you think Stearns will steamroll her way to victory, take the spread. But if you believe in the power of the underdog, Masarova at +4.5 might just be your ticket to glory—or at least a free coffee.

As for the total games, the line is set around 21.5 to 22.5, depending on where you look. If you think this match will be a marathon rather than a sprint, the over might be the way to go. But if you expect a quick resolution, the under could be your best bet.

So, what's the prediction? Stearns is likely to win, but Masarova won't go down without a fight. Expect a few surprises, some dramatic rallies, and maybe even a broken racket or two. My best bet? Take Stearns to win, but keep an eye on that spread for a little extra excitement. And remember, in tennis and in life, never underestimate the power of a good comeback.
