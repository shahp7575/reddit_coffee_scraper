1nqvk37,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1nqvk37/4_month_update_since_quitting/,4 month update since quitting,"So, up to about 4 months ago I used to drink about 2 strong coffees a day followed by maybe 3 or 4 cups of tea.

Anytime I'd go off coffee for 24 hours I'd get the withdrawal symptoms (headache etc..) and I hated that I had this chemical dependence on something so I kept going.

I've always been pretty anxious, have been diagnosed as ""possible ocd""( though never confirmed) and alot of this has gone recently

I wake up calmer in the morning, have no craving for coffee or tea, being more productive,  more present with my son and happier overall.

Admittedly, I've also been having better night sleep these past few months because my 3yo son is sleeping much better also.

I have no desire to drink coffee any more. However I DO want a cup of tea from time to time. And I have had about 4 cups in these past 4 months.

I'm wondering if I should allow myself 1 cup of tea a day or is it a slippery slope?

It really fucked me up, and I can think of a few instances from my childhood that are definitely NOT normal

1. Accidentally wore one of my friend’s dress-up skirts home from her house when I was maybe 5? Instead of thinking oh we can just bring it back to her, I was sure I was going to be struck down for stealing

2. In 3rd grade I drank an orange soda and then found out it had caffeine in it (my family was pretty strict about this) and cried for hours thinking I’d dirtied myself somehow

3. Another time in elementary school, a teacher gave us coffee filters to use for an art project, and I was fully convinced I was not allowed to use them because they were associated with coffee 💀

4. Having to get permission from my mom to wear a cheerleader outfit for a play I was in in middle school because the skirt was shorter than my knees and there were no sleeves. Was given the “it’s your choice” guilt tripping talk. The play was fun but I couldn’t stop feeling dirty :( it’s a shame because I was so cute 


I have unfortunately many of these stories, and unlearning some of these fears as an adult has not been easy. I’m curious to see how many people can relate to the intense fear surrounding breaking any rules in the church.

So, here’s the deal: if you’re over 50, you might’ve noticed that getting out of bed feels a bit like trying to start a rusty old car. You know what I mean? 😩 Those morning aches can feel relentless! But what if I told you there’s a 10-minute ""reverse aging"" stretch routine you can try that might just have you feeling like a sprightly teenager *again*? Yes, please!

I stumbled upon this killer stretch routine the other day (thank you, internet!) and honestly, it’s a total game-changer. After just a week of doing it, I felt lighter, less creaky, and was ready to tackle the day with more energy than my morning coffee ever gave me! ☕💪 Here's what you need to know:

**Why Stretching Is Your Best Friend:**
- **Awakens your muscles:** Hello flexibility! No more stiffness.
- **Boosts mood:** A little endorphin magic goes a long way. Who doesn’t want that?
- **Enhances blood flow:** Makes you feel alive and ready to conquer the world! 🌍

**Quick & Easy Stretch Routine:**
1. **Neck Rolls:** Gently drop your head to one side and roll it around. Feels amazing, right?
2. **Shoulder Shrugs:** Lift those shoulders up to your ears and then drop them – repeat a few times. *Bonus points for groaning dramatically!*
3. **Cat-Cow for your back:** Get on all fours and alternate between arching your back and dropping your belly. Perfect for those lower back gripes!
4. **Deep Forward Bend:** Stand tall, then slowly bend at the waist, letting gravity do its thing. Feel that release!
5. **Seated Hamstring Stretch:** Grab a seat, stretch out those legs, and lean forward gently. It’s like giving your legs a well-deserved hug.

**Remember:**
- It’s not about perfection. Stretching should feel good. If something hurts, back off a bit! 🌼
- Consistency is key. Try to squeeze this routine into your day, even if it feels like a time crunch. You’ll be surprised at how good you’ll feel afterwards!

And here's something that gets me excited: We truly believe in the strongest people (yes, YOU!), and just a little bit of dedicated time to your body can make a world of difference.

💡 **Quick Tip:** Try this stretch routine in front of the TV or while listening to your favorite podcast. It might just become your new favorite way to multitask!

Let’s be real—navigating through life in your 50s and beyond doesn’t have to mean settling for stiffness. Imagine waking up ready to tackle your day, whether that’s enjoying a leisurely walk or playing with your grandkids. 

So, anyone else feeling this morning ache struggle? What has helped you feel more limber and lively? Let’s swap some tips or even favorite stretches! 😊",1,1758873739.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

1nqvflw,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1nqvflw/struggling_big_time/,Struggling Big Time,"I’m currently 6 weeks pp and I’m struggling with a few things. 

1. My baby is colicky and is also spitting up a lot. He screams and screams and screams and there’s absolutely nothing I can do to calm him down when he gets that way. I’m trying to change my diet for him. The problem is, I don’t know what is causing the issues. I’m diabetic, so my diet is already limited and now I’m having to cut out the biggest craving I have (popcorn), limit my caffeine intake (not too much of a problem, I’m just replacing half of my daily coffee intake with decaf) but now I’m also possibly needing to cut out dairy as well. And anything heartburn/acid reflux producing. I’m feeling overwhelmed and like I can’t eat anything now that I have my appetite back after pregnancy. 

2. My baby is eating more than I am producing for about 3 days now. A couple days ago, he was cluster feeding so bad, I sat feeding for about 90% of the day. That’s not much of a problem in itself but he would latch, then let go and get frustrated and fuss, several times in a 1-2 min span. At this point, milk comes out of I self express, so I know he can still get something out. I think he’s having to work harder to get more out and gets frustrated. It’s frustrating for me too. My back is killing me from trying to keep him latched. I have a Brest Friend feeding pillow which helps but it’s still incredibly frustrating. 

3. I’m struggling with a little bit of pp depression because of the above but also a couple other reasons. My husband is pressuring me to be more intimate, which I understand but I’m also feeling so overwhelmed with everything, it’s just one more thing. (Other than this one thing, he’s very supportive and helpful. He does most things with our 15mo. He gets up with her at night if she wakes up and he gets up with her in the morning, feeds her and does most of the toddler things with her through the day. He also gets me anything I need like food and makes sure I’m hydrated and will help me move the bassinet and other baby items around. He’s amazing.) I have been experiencing pp rage along with mood swings from my blood sugars being very unstable because of the breast feeding. And I don’t get much time to myself. We live with my in-laws and my MIL takes the baby so I can shower, get coffee in the morning, eat dinner or just get a little break from the colic, but she’s not always home and even when I get those small breaks, aside from the shower, I’m not really getting time to myself. 

I had a video appointment with a nurse practitioner at my obs office a couple days ago. She told me they have therapy available but their office is a 30min, very stressful drive and I’m already overwhelmed enough. 

Thank you for reading my rambling venting. This is just so much. I didn’t feel ANY of this with our 15mo.",2,1758873499.0,breastfeeding,3,1.0,False

One day, I asked him to catch up over coffee and he said he had already scheduled a trip to his parents in the next 2 weekends. I couldn't make it to the next weekend after this and that he could also not make it to the next because his family is coming over. Now, he said the weekend after should be okay and also, my schedule was also free. So I asked him, should we pencil that weekend and he said I'd hear from him.

That weekend would be next weekend (not this coming weekend) and today's Friday. I haven't heard from him. On Monday, I might see him because I'm meeting a friend in their office who is his colleague. 

My question is, what should I do if I see him? I like the guy but I don't like it when I don't get the update. Am I asking too early for this because there are still a few days before that weekend?

What if he sees me and got reminded of it? I don't know, I just don't like the feeling of this because he said I'd hear from him.

I'm only sure that if he doesn't bring it up, I know my answer. But what if he does? What do I do? I don't want to give the impression that I'm too easy.

Sorry, folks. It's a bit confusing but I haven't dated for more than 5 years and never really asked a guy out. I'm getting out of my comfort zone and I'm in this situation. I just need advice before Monday comes.

That’s where wireless dog fences come in: magical invisible barriers that scream, “Stay in the yard, buddy,” without you having to build an actual fence (or explain to your HOA why it looks like Fort Knox). Here are seven of the most popular ones today, reviewed with the seriousness of someone who has definitely chased their dog down the street in pajamas.

⸻

1. PetSafe Wireless Pet Containment System
The OG of wireless fences. Simple setup, reliable, and your dog will quickly learn the invisible circle of nope. Basically the WiFi router of canine boundaries.
Amazon Link: https://amzn.to/4mH8cm9

2. PetSafe Stay & Play Compact Fence
Smaller, sleeker, and portable. Great for camping, traveling, or proving to your in-laws that yes, your dog can stay put… most of the time.
Amazon link: https://amzn.to/42yQbPV

3. The LOTYP 2-in-1 GPS Wireless Dog Fence & Remote Training Collar is basically the Swiss Army knife of canine containment. With a 4.6 out of 5 stars rating from 50 reviewers, it pulls double duty: one part invisible fence, one part “hey, stop eating the couch cushion” training tool. Using GPS, it lays down a virtual boundary without wires, then gives you remote control options for training on the fly. It’s like combining an invisible fence, a personal trainer, and a life coach—all tucked neatly into one collar. Perfect for medium-to-large dogs and anyone tired of playing “catch me if you can” in their slippers. 🐶📡
Amazon link: https://amzn.to/4nK6a5C


4. The FOCUSER GPS Wireless Dog Fence System is basically Google Maps for your dog, except instead of finding coffee shops it just yells “stay in the yard, buddy.” Using satellites instead of buried wires, it sets up an invisible border wherever you drop the pin—your lawn, the campsite, or even Grandma’s house. It’s portable, budget-friendly, and perfect if your pup thinks “yard boundaries” are just suggestions. Just remember: if your dog starts side-eyeing the sky, it’s probably because they’ve figured out the satellites are snitching. Amazon Link: https://amzn.to/48yvnLU

5. Extreme Dog Fence 2nd Gen
The “go big or go home” wired/wireless hybrid. Great for stubborn dogs, giant yards, or anyone whose pet has the escape skills of Houdini.

6. The SATELLAI Dog Wireless Fence sounds less like a pet product and more like something Elon Musk would strap on a Mars rover. It’s got AI analysis, precise GPS positioning, a 5-day battery, and waterproofing tough enough that your dog could basically join the Navy. Designed for medium and large dogs, it sets up flexible virtual fences anywhere—so instead of bolting after squirrels, your pup’s stuck inside their invisible sci-fi prison. Honestly, it’s less of a collar and more of a mission-control device that makes you wonder: is my dog being contained, or is he secretly being tracked by NASA? 🐶🚀
Amazon Link: https://amzn.to/4mH8Y2x

7. The PRTRFLC GPS Wireless Dog Fence System is like giving your pup a personal bodyguard who just happens to be powered by satellites. With a 4.9 out of 5 stars rating (from 34 very relieved dog owners), it’s clear this thing works—probably better than your New Year’s resolutions. It sets up virtual boundaries without wires, so no digging, no hassle, just an invisible “do not cross” line that your dog will actually respect. Think of it as an ankle monitor for your furry escape artist, but way cuter and with fewer court dates. 🐕✨
Amazon link: https://amzn.to/4gIhgG4

⸻

Bottom line: wireless dog fences are less about shocking your pup and more about shocking you when they actually work. Whether you want high-tech GPS boundaries, a simple plug-and-play system, or a collar fancier than your smartwatch, there’s an option here to keep your furry friend safe, sound, and out of your neighbor’s pool. 🐶✨

I’m not looking for spreadsheets or complex math, just something clear and repeatable.

My plan is a light routine: quick check a few times a week, a one-line Sunday note about rewards, and mostly reinvesting so momentum builds, with a small treat now and then to stay motivated.

(USA, UK, CANADA & Worldwide)","So here’s the deal — I never thought I’d be one of those students even considering research paper writing services. I’ve always been the type to grind out essays last minute, live on coffee, and pull all-nighters. But the deeper I get into my program, the harder it’s been to juggle everything at once. Between long shifts at work, family stuff, and professors who all think their class should be “top priority,” it feels like there are never enough hours in the day.

That’s when I started looking into essay and research paper services. At first, I thought they were all scams. A quick Google search gives you hundreds of sites promising “guaranteed A+ papers” and “instant delivery.” But if you read through Reddit threads, Quora posts, or even Trustpilot reviews, the experiences are all over the place. Some people say they got lifesavers, others ended up with recycled garbage that set them back even more.

Here’s what I’ve figured out so far:

Super cheap services are a trap. They’ll lure you in with $5/page deals, but the quality is usually trash. It’s like gambling — you might get something decent once, but you’ll regret it 9 times out of 10.

Turnaround times matter more than you think. Some services can deliver overnight, but speed doesn’t always equal quality. I’ve seen plenty of comments about rushed, shallow papers.

Specialization actually matters. A business major writing a psychology paper is just as bad as me trying to write an engineering lab report. Some services pair you with writers in your field — that seems like a big plus.

Communication is key. If you can’t directly talk to the writer, revisions become a nightmare.

Now, full honesty: I haven’t tried [https://www.gradegivers.com/](https://www.gradegivers.com/) myself yet, but I keep seeing the name pop up in different student groups and forums. From what I’ve read, they seem to lean more toward research-intensive projects rather than just short essays. Supposedly, they provide solid referencing and detailed outlines, which sounds way more useful than those “cookie-cutter essays” other sites churn out. I’m genuinely curious if anyone here has firsthand experience with them.

For me, I’m not looking for a magic fix or a “get an A instantly” type of thing. What I would use a service for is stuff like:

Breaking down a huge research assignment into smaller drafts.

Help with finding credible sources and formatting citations correctly.

Getting feedback on whether my argument even makes sense before I spend 10 hours expanding it.

That’s the kind of support that feels ethical and actually helpful — not just passing off someone else’s work as my own.

So I wanted to throw this post out there:

Have you personally used any of these services in a way that actually improved your writing or made school less stressful?

If you’ve tested GradeGivers, did it actually live up to the positive mentions, or is it just another overhyped name?

What red flags should other students watch out for when trying one of these sites for the first time?

I know this is a sensitive topic because of academic integrity, but I also know I can’t be the only one who’s struggled with time management and insane workloads. Thought it might be useful to share real experiences instead of the usual ads or scare stories floating around.

Quick update: our small group for new KU Leuven students has gotten off to a promising start! We’re now reopening entries, so if you’re interested in joining, please introduce yourself in a DM , would love to get to know you a little before we all meet up.

Just to share a bit of what we’ve been up to: last week, a few of us met for a relaxed board game night (see photo attached!) and it was genuinely fun with a welcoming vibe.

The idea behind this group is simple it’s specifically for those of us who just joined  KU Leuven this year and don’t already have established friend groups. We’re building something chill, where you can meet new faces in a low-pressure setting, whether you’re introverted, shy, or just not into the whole party scene.

Here’s what we’re thinking:

Casual coffee meetups
• Board game nights
• Outdoor activities when the weather's nice
• City tours, cycling , Hiking, Study sessions. 

If you:

• Just started at KU Leuven this year (leuven campus)
• Feel a bit overwhelmed by the big party scene
• Want to meet people in a more relaxed way
• Are tired of feeling on the outside of tight-knit circles
• Actually want real conversations and genuine connections

..then this group might be for you!

It's not about criticizing the existing societies - they're amazing and lots of people enjoy them.
This is simply an extra option for those looking for something different.

So if you feel like this resonates, DM me a short intro about yourself to join the group! You can also share any ideas for what we could call ourselves, activities, or places we could meet",10,1758871927.0,KULeuven,0,0.92,False

not all days I can finish the entire 4 cups and will have one/two cup left over which i drink the next day as I'm brewing the next batch 

the old brew changes in taste noticably not in a totally bad way tho it just tastes different 

do you also have this routine or you just brew one fresh cup at a time ?

I've been living in a tiny apartment in the city for the past couple of years, and finding the right kitchen appliances that don't eat up all my counter space has been quite the journey. Today, I want to share my experience with finding the perfect coffee grinder for small kitchens.

After trying several options and making plenty of mistakes, I've finally found what works best. If you're like me, struggling with limited counter space but unwilling to compromise on your morning brew, this post is for you.

First things first - manual grinders are great space-savers, but let's be real, who has the energy to hand-grind beans every morning? I needed something electric but compact. After extensive research and testing, I found some fantastic options at https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder that really changed the game for me.

Here's what I've learned to look for in a compact coffee grinder:

1. Footprint size (obviously!)
- Look for grinders under 6 inches wide
- Vertical designs work better than horizontal ones
- Consider height - make sure it fits under your cabinets

2. Bean capacity
- 8-12 oz is perfect for small spaces
- Anything larger is usually too bulky

3. Noise level (important in small apartments!)
- Burr grinders are typically quieter
- Look for models with noise-reducing features

4. Storage solutions
- Built-in cord storage is a huge plus
- Removable parts for easy cleaning

I personally went with a burr grinder from the selection at https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder because it offers the best balance of size and functionality. It's barely bigger than a milk frother but does an amazing job with consistent grounds.

Pro tip: Consider a model with a removable grinding chamber. This makes cleaning way easier and lets you store it in a cabinet when not in use.

Some extra space-saving tips I've learned:
- Store your beans in the grinder's hopper
- Use the grinder's container as a grounds keeper
- Mount a small shelf specifically for your grinder
- Consider a 2-in-1 grinder/brewer if really tight on space

Remember, just because you have a small kitchen doesn't mean you have to settle for pre-ground coffee or bulky equipment. The right grinder can make all the difference without cramping your style or your counter space.

(for context I'm a girl). I'd never have expected to meet so many people on my first day, I thought I'd be alone for at least a week or something. I know big groups like this usually break and become smaller ones, with 3-5 people and some girls already got out together for the second time.
I don't expect to become friends with all of them but I'd like to keep in touch with some and maybe hang out sometimes.

There's one girl I know though, cause we were besties two years ago before she revealed her bad character. I hadn't seen her in 3 months and didn't know I'd unfortunately see her again in uni. And that's where my problem starts.

I have zero interest in hanging out with her ever again. I want to form new relationships and I feel like she'll ruin them.

I've been talking through texts with another girl for the past two days. She seems legit. We'll all go to uni again on Monday. I was thinking about suggesting we go for a coffee or something before that, at the weekend. But I'm worried I might sound weird cause I think it's too fast.

Thing is, I wouldn't mind inviting some of the others too but then I risk her inviting the one I don't want to. 

So my question is, should I ask her to hang out? Try and build a deeper relationship that could lead to a friendship, or is it too soon? 
I'm afraid if I wait for the lessons to start, a group could be formed that includes my ex bestie.

But then again, supposing I do suggest we go out, what if she suggests we invite more girls? What do I say? ""Anyone except that one?"" 

Maybe I'm overthinking it and should just give it a shot, but I'm not the most social and extroverted person so I'm holding back. 

I'd appreciate an outside perspective.Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to ask. And thank you if you've read this far. :)

I am particularly close with one of my aunts(Donna) and her daughter Cara. She lost her eldest daughter way back and my mom and her were quite close. However  the have a bad habit of ignoring people and shutting them out when they feel you have done something wrong or you don't want to do what they want. Like you just ask them hey can you just borrow me ladder and they get angry because you might have said it a certain way or asked for it when they weren't in the mood to borrow it and then they won't speak to  you for months .They have done it for years. I don't know if they have this sort of superiority complex or what. But you wont even know you did something wrong until you see they aren't visiting or aren't returning our texts. I graduated from my previous college  in 2023 and asked my Cara if she could take my photos. She never replied to my texts and her mom Donna told me she was busy with work. I hadn't thought much of  it then but I felt like she could have atleast returned my texts and just said hey dork I don't want to take your stupid photos I have a life , I mean it wouldn't have even taken a minute for her to text me back and say no. Anyway in 2024 I don't know if she felt guilty or what or if she even realised what she done then she started coming back into our lives as nothing happened she suddenly planned this big sleepover party for my graduation and had everyone wrote letters saying how happy they are and how proud they are even thug I never asked for that. I attended the sleepover and accepted everything gratefully. I have always donated blood and we kind of share that in common so she invited me to join her and we did it regularly. She always spoke about how she would invite my younger siblings and our little cousin along to join the blood donation so they can see what it is and how important it is and I agreed with the idea. Anyway fast forward in 2024  my family hit a rough patch and I asked her if she could help us and she did. Everything was fine , she even offered  help with my driving and bought be a driving book. Fast forward in beginning of 2025 she told me she would let me know when she would help me with driving lesson. We donated blood ,went for coffee and then suddenly one day at college I missed the bused and she didn't return my calls when I asked if she'd give me a ride home. Then suddenly our dates for blood donation came and went and she never said anything. I heard from my little cousin that she had taken her with. Suddenly Donna said that  I should find out why she didn't take me with and I said no its okay. Then after like 4 months she texts me back and says hey blood donation is coming up and I told her I that I donated blood a few weeks ago ,which I had because I wasn't going to wait for her ,because why should I? I am not the type of person to easily lose trust in people and I'm forgiving but she ignored me and it wasn't the first time and didn't even have the decency to message me and say she didn't want to take me with to donate blood. It was her birthday on the 15th of September and I wished her but she never returned my text. I don't know what to do. I am plannignn on blocking her but is that harsh? I do not want to ask her why she doesn't communicate with me and quite frankly I don't care I too can ignore her texts but why does she do that? I'll never know what I did wrong for her to ignore me but its clear that she doesn't respect me enough to even text me back and say hey I don't like when you do this or hey I don't want to do this with you anymore. Like I said I don't know if my aunts have this sort of superiority complex but I'm not here  for it . I'll always be grateful for what they have done as they've done a lot for me and my family when we struggled but that doesn't give them a reason to treat me like shit. I am  trying to berespectful since she is older than me and my aunt but I am not going to tolerate such crap and I totally doubt she did all those things in 2024 out of goodness. I think she felt guilty. I am starting to see the truth and keep her at an arms length. she's  a stranger to me. Am I wrong  or am I overreacting.",2,1758871582.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

1nqur9g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqur9g,3 months global continuous pass stats..,"There was a sale for Eurail passes earlier this year..

My holiday was a rail holiday - the object of my holiday was to travel almost every day on trains somewhere as i just love trains & sitting in them watching the world go by was the holiday. The journey was the holiday, not necessarily the destination .

Although my Eurail map looks like a kid got a marker and just scribbled on a map of Europe - I did actually have a basic plan to traverse the continent form east to west then move north slightly just criss-crossing back & forth again across Europe whilst slowly making my way northwards.

I caught a ferry from Poland to Sweden, Liverpool to Dublin & Dover to Calias where I wandered back a forth over Eupope again before making my way down from Poland through Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and finally into Turkey..

Nothing was really planned except that I had a general idea of the direction I wanted to travel. Most train journey decisions where made on the spot or the night before. If I liked a place I stayed there for a few days longer - similarly if I didn't like and area, I moved on some place else.

3 month global pass continuous was  
A$ 1200  
US$ 785  
Euro 672

I had the opportunity to upgrade it to first class for

A$ 300  
US$ 196  
Euro 168

I chose to do this mainly because my holiday was during summer vacation time in Europe - I arrived in Vienna on 10th June & departed Istanbul on 9th September.

I thought by having the 1st class pass I could take advantage of 1st class carriages being not as full as 2nd class especially during July and on some of the busier routes. This proved to be correct as many 2nd class carriages were standing room without reservations whilst I could always find a seat in 1st class even without a reservation.

The biggest bonus was when I was in the UK. 1st class trains on longer journeys would provide meals and drinks at no extra cost. I ended up supplementing my holiday by catching long distance trains at meal times every day just to have a nice freshly cooked meal and drinks.

Denmark 1st class trains also provided free coffee / tea making facilities & water, with free chocolates, biscuits, cookies, slices etc.

Some nights I would book a train sleeper cabin and sleep on the train instead of booking a hotel.

I spent the last few days going back over my individual train journeys and pricing them.  
The app shows I did 278 train journeys, however it was slightly over 300 - the app didn't get all of the trips or maybe I deleted some - but there were a few I noticed were not on the app when I did my spreadsheet analysis.

1st class pricing for all train journeys combined totaled:

A$ 14265  
US$ 9330  
Euro 7990

2nd class totals:

A$ 9260  
US$ 6056  
Euro 5187

Although my holiday was different to most other people as I averaged 3-4 train trips each day --- the Eurail was for a total of A$ 1500 was definitely worth it...

I traveled to 21 countries, about 25,000 km's on trains & a little over 300 train journeys.

My shortest stay somewhere was overnight, my longest stay was 1 week & I tried to stay at a 'base' for 3 days minimum and then do all my exploring on various train journeys from the one town/city before moving onto another area.

I preferred to stay outside of major cities, sometimes on the fringe but mostly in semi-rural areas.

My accommodation costs averaged A$80 per day which over 90 days totaled about:

A$ 7200  
US$ 4710  
Euro 4033

As I was on my own, I didn't eat out much and chose accommodation with cooking facilities, thus I bought most of my food from supermarkets. (Except in UK where I ate 90% of meals on trains)..",10,1758870808.0,Interrail,1,0.92,False

Also not looking for anyone to diagnose me of course, but if I manage to find someone out there who is having the same symptoms maybe it could help me pin this down, because this has been so exhausting and stressful.

Every so often I get a kind of episode. It begins generally with gas and a general feeling of unease and then comes nausea, more gas, feverishness, and pounding heart. It will last a minimum of 4 hrs but the longest it's gone on was 36 hrs, and I will pee every hour and have a BM every other hour until it's over. Once the worst passes I have a few more hours of shivering and sweating, which I can only assume is my body cooling back down from fever. All in all it feels as though my body is purging something. I've weighed myself before and after one, and I can lose nearly 2kg in one night after going through this, presumably water weight but probably some gut weight as well. It's miserable.

I'm in my early 30s and have no allergies or intolerances that I know of, and I'm still struggling to pin down a trigger. They certainly feel like gastrointestinal symptoms, but sometimes it can happen as late as 8-10 hours after eating, and I don't have any clear culprits in terms of foods I ate in common. The most plausible culprit is egg, because the last three have all been after eating at least some egg, but on the other hand I have eaten egg on other occasions with no symptoms.

My doctor has waved it off as IBS, but it isn't sitting right with me because I don't experience any diarrhoea at all, no cramping or pain, and most of the month I have zero symptoms and seem to have an iron gut. He has also suggested coffee or lactose, but again I don't buy it because I drink the equivalent of a whole mug of whole milk with my coffee every day with no symptoms at all on the vast majority of days. Not to mention the fever and the occasionally extreme duration of the symptoms don't line up with my understanding of IBS. He actually agreed on this front too, but said he wasn't sure what else to suggest other than to keep a food diary and try to find an answer, which I am doing so far with no success.

Are these symptoms at all familiar to anyone? Could egg intolerance or some other intolerance cause these kinds of symptoms for so long, without also causing stomach cramping/diarrhea etc? I'm desperate and looking for any clues at this point. Will probably try cutting out egg, but if that fails I'll be totally lost.

.

.

.

**\~Episode 1: Cloudy with a Chance of Occasional Trade Goods\~**

Let’s rewind time, back to a few hours ago, in front of the main gate of Wild Hunt. Today was more crowded than usual, partly because the special art exhibition ""Veronica"" was about to take place. This exhibition was sponsored by the Veronica Corporation, which was also the owner of these precious paintings. Of course, Sensei came to Wild Hunt not to enjoy the beautiful scenery, but to take care of related work, so that will be later.

In front of Sensei was a checkpoint set up by the academy, and it seemed that security had been heightened these days. For example, a student in front of Sensei had her watercolors confiscated because the school was afraid that someone would dare to mix coffee into the watercolors and drink them (that had happened for some reason. Huh?), and the Head Inspector of the Dormitory Supervisor Department had stipulated that caffeinated drinks were prohibited, so the student had to reluctantly comply.

Next was Sensei, and the inspector was not too surprised to see Sensei. The students at the academy were already familiar with Sensei as he had started to visit the school more often. Sensei asked a few questions, and then the inspector checked Sensei's bag. Surprisingly, a coffee cup made of ceramic was banned according to the academy's regulations because someone had mixed gunpowder in the ceramic, so…

Yep, it was banned. After a while, when it was determined that there were no problems, the inspector allowed Sensei to enter the academy. An hour later, after finishing all the work related to it, while walking around the school's yard, Sensei found an empty plot of land in the garden. Thinking that it would be a long time before he could reach the main entrance of the school. Thinking that he could rest here, Sensei sat down to rest for a while, but suddenly someone shouted to be careful. It was too late, a bag of goods fell from above on Sensei's head, and we returned to the moment of the opening episode.

.

That's right, Miyo was the one who brought Sensei to the infirmary and then returned to her dorm. That big, round bag of goods was actually smuggled into the school. Miyo then used a catapult prepared outside and shot it into the school wall, but unfortunately, right after shooting, she saw Sensei sitting there and became the target. Miyo screamed, but it was too late; Sensei passed out.

Miyo apologized to Sensei on behalf of the entire Special Trade Department (STD) for this incident, and fortunately, Sensei was not seriously injured. Miyo sighed, talking to herself about not using the catapult in the first place, then the person who was responsible for shooting it walked in. That was Wakasa Fuyu, the team's sales manager and also in charge of the sales of all kinds of tech products. When Miyo asked Fuyu why she had to use the catapult (even though she knew what the answer would be), Fuyu covered it up…

[Fuyu: BECAUSE IT'S SO COOL!!!!!111!1!!!](https://preview.redd.it/e9baotcwkgrf1.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5c99da7c2c584fe7bc70462ed91361ca1bde545)

[Miyo: Please don't say that word ever again...](https://preview.redd.it/aowjupbxkgrf1.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=057996a4f098d78afa2a31259a532ae1b8b5f1be)

**Fuyu:** W-What… Why?

**Miyo:** Because someone got hurt, didn't you see?

**Fuyu:** But there are cushions inside it, no?

**Miyo:** That's to protect the goods, not to protect someone!

**Sensei:** Calm down, both of you…

.

To avoid causing any more unnecessary arguments, Sensei stepped in to mediate. Fuyu also realized what she had done, so she gave the ointment from the infirmary to the doctor and then gave the trading card to Sensei. Miyo wondered when her room had this. Fuyu replied that it was to make it more professional... But wait, doing that would be like announcing to the whole school that she was doing something illegal, right?

Fuyu told her Manager, Miyo, to rest assured, everything had been resolved, if she was still worried then... Then let Sensei use the service for free the first time and consider both sides satisfied, Miyo had no other choice... Well, let's just praise Fuyu for her talent.

But before Sensei makes any transaction with the group, they need to know one thing, that… Specifically, what are the group's ""smuggled"" goods?

Fuyu explained that the group's goods were things that the students needed, but the academy banned them. More specifically, the strict, constant inspections and unreasonable confiscations in the academy had made it impossible for students to complete a work of art. That was where the Special Transactions Department stepped in.

The department's main job was to collect requests from students who needed their services and use their own money to buy and smuggle them into the school. Of course, the price for the service was reasonable, so she said. But wouldn't doing this violate school regulations? Fuyu understood that, so she suggested that Sensei come along to see what a day in the department was like and then decide. Sensei agreed because they were quite curious to see how the department worked.

Miyo, the leader, also gives her assent. Suddenly, the door bursts open, and a student walks in proudly.

**???:** Miyo-chan! I **""buried""** it!

**Sensei:** WHAT?!

\- - - - - - - -

**\~Episode 2: Always Listen To Your Concern\~**

**""Buried""?** Buried what? Miyo urges her to be clearer, and the girl explains that she only **""planted the seeds.""** Maybe because she was used to having only people in the department, she did not notice that a third person was standing right next to her. When she realized it, she introduced herself as **Usuba Ritsu**, a sculpture major whose specialty is transactions.

Ritsu, like other new students meeting Sensei, brings up the infamous story of Sensei running naked across the fields during Vol F (well... Spoiler? But it was memeed too much, so... :) ). Ritsu suggests Sensei could run like that on the campus too—but only within the limits of an art performance…

Fuyu, taking advantage of Ritsu's enthusiasm, asks her to lead Sensei and the others to the planting site. Ritsu grows suspicious, reminding Fuyu that they shouldn't share information with outsiders, especially Sensei. Fuyu reassures her, whispering (loud enough for Sensei to hear) that since Sensei is an adult, working with him will increase their credibility and open up many new work opportunities... essentially, more money :money:. Ignoring Fuyu and Ritsu, Miyo quickly escorts Sensei and the two girls to the location.

.

Arriving at the familiar location where Sensei was hit on the head by a package, the four of them quickly hid in a corner of the bushes and waited for the customer to come and pick up the goods. In fact, this so-called “seeding” activity was just a secret way for the department to cover up the fact that they hid the goods inside a package and buried it in a pre-designated location for the customer to come and pick up.

You will definitely remember this because it was also the method the Occult Research Society used to get the goods and create their magic circle. While they were talking, a student from the academy came to the burial site and took out a box of volcanic-flavor fried chicken and quickly left. As you can see, the range of items that students need is very diverse, from items like paint brushes, LED lights, etc., to normal things like food and drinks, the department receives and smuggles them all in.

Fuyu explained that, like the materials, even the food is closely monitored. Also, not everyone has permission to go out, so the department will make sure that everyone gets what they need. After finishing the work in this corner, the group moved to another location.

This place has many trees, and there must be illegal goods buried between the trees. Another student went to the burial site, where they dug up and found the paint they needed to complete the painting. The reason that paint was banned was that it contained bacteria and could be harmful to their health. Just like that, Sensei and the Special Trade Department went around the entire school, looking for places to bury things. Looking at the smuggled goods, they only saw necessary items or necessities for the students, and there were no other dangerous goods.

. .

The group stops at a park corner for a rest. Sensei tells Fuyu that their work seems much more peaceful than he'd imagined. Fuyu explains this is just the tip of the iceberg, and their success is due to Miyo, who taught them how to avoid the dormitory supervisors and how to handle the officials from the Dormitory Supervisor Department. This is why Miyo is the ""brain"" of the operation, worthy of the title of Manager.

**Fuyu:** Accept it, Miyo. You are... the **Queen of Trade**!

**Ritsu:** Yeah! Miyo's plan never has any loopholes!

Miyo, despite her modesty, blushes at the compliments. Fuyu then brings up a major issue she needs Miyo's intelligence for. Miyo refuses instantly, knowing that the job will have high pay but also means a weird commission. Fuyu guarantees that after she hears the second piece of news, she'll reconsider. She shows Miyo evidence that the rare **Cutie Berry 87 typewriter** is being sold on the secondhand market. Miyo is immediately excited—she's been longing for the ""cursed masterpiece"" for her collection (a machine Fuyu notes is infamous for having an **anti-personnel mine** built into it).

Fuyu brings Miyo back to reality: her current funds aren't enough to buy it. Miyo, hit where it hurts, reluctantly accepts the big commission, with the thought of buying not just one, but five of the typewriters (a reason funded by Fuyu's hype).

Now then, let’s listen to what the customer has to say, shall we?

\- - - - - - - 

**\~Episode 3: Who Will Love Them, Indigo And Blue?\~**

— The Day Before.

A man requests STD's services. Since it's an outside commission, they meet at a cafe. Fuyu reassures the man of their reputation: ""We have never failed.""

Feeling at ease, the man sits down and makes his request. It's not a delivery request, but for a **""heist""**—to steal a painting from Wild Hunt Academy. Fuyu is about to leave, seeing trouble, but the man stops her, wanting to explain his reason.

The man, a once-talented young painter, reveals that he once **forged** a famous painting, a mistake he deeply regrets. He wants to correct his past mistake because his forged painting is about to be displayed at the school's exhibition. The painting is **""Who Will Love Them, Indigo and Blue?""**

Fuyu, as an art student, recognizes the painting and is shocked to hear that the displayed version is a fake. The painter's goal is to retrieve the fake one. Fuyu wonders why he doesn't report it to the corporation, but the painter explains he bought the real one at a black market auction. He shows the real painting to Fuyu, who is amazed. His final wish is simply to swap the two paintings back to their rightful places. He does not want to report it himself and be labeled a forger, even though his heart is set on correcting the mistake, weird but understandable.

[Cut-in Image: The Valuable Painting](https://preview.redd.it/9o4gmvwclgrf1.png?width=381&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b48b912b7f9b04259a96cc98f67f88ab2dbf9b7)

Fuyu, concerned, asks if the painting he showed her is truly genuine, or if they would be abetting another forger. The man, seeing her worry, says they can do whatever they want with the swapped fake one. He assures her that a painter who comes forward and admits his forgery must know the difference between the real and the fake. Fuyu remains silent for a moment... and then, **Today**.

. .

Fuyu shows the real painting to the group, who are mesmerized by its beauty. Fuyu tells Miyo that the commission doesn't violate any laws; it's simply swapping a fake for the real one, and the pay is extraordinarily high, enough to change their lives.

But would it be okay to have Sensei here? Maybe because she was used to having only people in the department, she did not notice that a third person was standing right next to her. Fuyu panics when she realizes Sensei is right beside them, but quickly regains her composure. Sensei tells them that they think it's right to return the painting to where it belongs, trusting the painter's sincerity, but confirms that they will only **observe** their operation.

Miyo, after weighing the choice between dissolving the club and taking this final, lucrative job to buy her cherished typewriter, decides to accept the case. The Special Trade Department now has a very special mission.

**Miyo:** ...It's time to **""write""** the plan.

Sometimes my heart will beat really fast and hard generally on days where I have caffeine. A couple days ago I almost passed out while brushing my teeth in the shower. I closed my eyes and started falling forward before catching myself. I live basically alone and it was a day after I broke up with my girlfriend so I was pretty sure if I did pass out no one would find me till it was too late. I got out of an elevator today and it started jerking and shaking and I wondered what if it fell while I was in between. 

Anyway, I’m aware this is a lot of rambling. I have therapy starting next week; I’m certain I have some OCD and my recent breakup is not helping my mental health.

I’m just petrified that any of these listed scenarios may have left a grieving family and friends and ex girlfriend behind. The thought of them hurting and missing me and that ruining their lives hurts too much. I want to just tell them I’m okay. This + the dissociation makes me feel like this world isn’t mine and these people I know aren’t mine. I don’t know. If anyone has advice!",2,1758869861.0,QuantumImmortality,1,1.0,False

My husband is a huge coffee drinker and was quite the fan of the bikini coffee stands that are located throughout WA. After sharing how uncomfortable I am with him going to these coffee stands, he stopped (or so he told me). But while on his phone/instagram the other night, I discovered that he was following a significant amount of bikini baristas accounts, including some girls of a regular coffee stand located near us, and also a message saying “thank you for the show, that was the perfect way to begin night shift” to what I can only assume was one bikini barista (that is now a deleted account). Since I found these accounts on his Instagram, I began to wonder what else he was hiding and ended up finding tons of inappropriate pics/videos of random girls he saved and sent to others on a mass sexting group chat.

Two days ago at the bar counter of Pizzeria Delfina (Palo Alto), I discovered they have two kinds of affogato:
	•	Regular Affogato: soft-serve swirl ice cream with a cup of pleasantly bitter espresso.
	•	Affogato Corretto (boozy version): Double 8 Dairy soft-serve topped with Neapolitan blend espresso, plus a cup of Margerum Amaro Italian bitter liqueur.

I ordered the boozy version. What arrived was a generously sized, classic soft-serve swirl with lovely dairy richness. Since the portion was a bit large, I asked for a small bowl, scooped the top half of the ice cream into it, then started on the half remaining in the cup: the half in the cup got the espresso, and the half in the small bowl got the Amaro. The first bite: the milky sweetness of the ice cream, the roasty bitterness of the coffee, and the herbal liqueur notes of the Amaro layered together—not cloyingly sweet, not harshly bitter, yet with a clear alcoholic presence and substantial depth.

After finishing the ice cream in the cup, I poured the remaining coffee and liqueur into the small bowl—two rounds of joy from the same serving.

Tips
This dessert may be seasonal; to avoid a wasted trip, call the restaurant first to confirm it’s available that day.

Fun Discovery
             After I got home, I looked up this liqueur, and ChatGPT told me the following—sharing here for anyone curious:

Margerum Amaro from Santa Barbara, California, is an American amaro-style herbal liqueur made on a base of wine and grape distillate, aged long-term using a solera system (about 23% ABV). 

The style leans slightly sweet, with pronounced herbal and orange-peel notes, along with brown sugar/caramel, vanilla, and a gentle medicinal bitterness; the finish shows a touch of white pepper. It works as a digestif, neat or over ice.

How to Use:

• Affogato upgrade: espresso + ice cream + 10–15 ml Margerum Amaro; the sweetness and herbs neatly pull together the bitterness and cream.

• Cold-brew coffee highball: 60 ml cold brew + 20 ml Margerum Amaro, over ice with soda water; express a strip of lemon peel as an aromatic bridge.

• Cocoa–Amaro hot drink (fall/winter): 150 ml unsweetened cocoa + 20–25 ml Margerum Amaro, top with frothed milk and grate a little orange peel.”",9,1758868862.0,paloalto,0,1.0,False

1nqu8gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nqu8gq/frustrated_with_espresso_making_bambino_plus_and/,Frustrated with espresso making [Bambino Plus and DF64 Gen 2],"Hello all, I am a beginner in espresso making and probably poured away more than 40 cups by now. I simply can't get the golden ratio of 1:2 within a specific time frame. Will try to be as detailed and as specific as possible.

Step 1: Grinding 16grams of freshly roasted medium beans (1 week old from roasting). Spray water to reduce static prior to throwing into the grinder

Step 2: Pour coffee powder into bottomless portafiler --> WBT, Level, Tamp. Put on puck screen

Step 3: Press double espresso button

I generally get around 31g of espresso within 15 sec (excluding preinfusion time). This timing is way too fast right? I calculate by heart the pre-infusion time (which is approx 8sec). Any attempt to make the bean grind coarser will result in even fast duration and more espresso while grinding it finer results in much lesser espresso. (and I am talking about just shifting half a notch in DF64).

I am happy with the amount of espresso that's coming out now but would like to increase the duration. But shifting the grinder will throw the amount of espresso to be out of whack again. It's like there are two variables out there but i have only one tool (i.e. the grinder) to solve both problems. I just can't get the right 16g in 32g out within 25-30 sec (inclusive of pre-infusion).

What else can I do?

Gears used during espresso making:

\- DF64 Gen 2  
\- Nomcore portafiler, puckscreen (1.7mm), distributor tool, tamper

I’m a 37 year old woman with the dreaded acne/wrinkles/redness/dryness combo.


My biggest concern is texture- my skin is bumpy (beyond just the pimples) and looks tired/aged even when wearing makeup.


First two photos are mid afternoon after a day of no makeup. Last photo is me with makeup.


*Current regime:*

⁠- Moisturise 2x day (The Ordinary Natural Moisturising Factors + PhytoCeramides). Cleanse morning and night, with a double cleanse in evening (CeraVe SA Smoothing Cleanser). I like this cleanser because it actually removes my makeup, unlike the gentle Cetaphil cleanser (and the oily skin Cetaphil cleanser seems to dry my skin out too much).

- Use Elf pore putty primer to smooth my skin when applying makeup (works ok, not great), and thoroughly wash makeup brushes 1-2x week. Wear makeup 6-7 days/week. Try to select longer wearing makeup (I hate reapplying during the day and with a toddler it’s constantly rubbing off), and avoid matte finishes.

- Currently on preconception multivitamins (Blackmores conceive well gold), sertraline, and Concerta/Ritalin.

- Could improve my water 💧 intake (I mean, couldn’t we all!), and reduce coffee ☕️ consumption (2x day), but really don’t want to!


*History:*

⁠- The Ordinary Vitamin C was fine, but didn’t make a big change to redness/texture after 2-3 months of religious application. Plan to add back to my routine just in case it was helpful… but I didn’t think it was life changing at the time.

- “I’ve tried so many things”… proceeds to list almost nothing 😂 Honestly, there are too many to list. Name the acne routine- I’ve tried it. For the anti-ageing stuff- I’m pretty clueless. Until this year, my focus was always on my pimples, but now wrinkles/dryness/redness have entered the equation. Happy to answer any questions if product details are helpful/required.

- I’ve been on Accutane three (!!) times - when I was 14, 26, 31. Worked so well (glass skin alert!), I’m a big advocate, but pimples and texture keep returning. My experience has shown me it’s not a long term solution for me. Further, we’re trying for another baby and so it’s no longer an option (nor retinol products I believe?).

- Previously had oily skin, now dry (possibly combo).

- No gluten, dairy, soy allergies/intolerances.

- Occasionally get Botox for my 11s, but money is tight right now due to daycare fees so I’ve been putting it off.

So a while back I had a female friend let's call her Dee. So Dee and I just started out as casual friends. She used to live by herself near her school. 

So while we were talking about this and that I mentioned I'm a really good cook. Of which I am. So she told me to prove it. We arranged for a date I'd be off from work and go cook. 

The day came. I did a small shopping spree of items I required since she had most of the ingredients. I decided to cook vegetable rice, chicken curry, mashed potatoes, sliced beef and salad toppings.

This girl was looking at me impressed at how I managed that kitchen as if it was mine. I actually do love cooking a lot. We ate and she sucked the life out of that food. I cleaned after and made us a cup of coffee each and we started watching Manchester by the sea. 

After the movie I left not expecting anything but happy someone enjoyed my cooking. After she starts acting a bit weird, replies were few and nonchalant. I later asked her what's wrong? She opened up and said the day I went to cook she wanted me. I'm like 'huh?' she said she didn't know what she always wanted me but couldn't know how to approach me  and that day she wanted me but it seemed I wasn't interested.

Just finished another ranked session (got absolutely wrecked, as usual), but what's really bothering me is how crazy expensive these Valorant skins are for us Indians.

I've been playing this game for so long now, and every time a new collection drops, I just sit there admiring it knowing I can't afford it. These skin bundles cost more than what my family spends on groceries for weeks! Like seriously, who decided these prices? That fancy new collection everyone's showing off ₹7,000! Do you realize how much food that money can buy? My parents would absolutely lose their minds if they knew I was even thinking about spending that much on a game.

The battle pass alone is ₹1,000. For Americans, $10 is probably what they spend on coffee without thinking twice. But here? That's my entire pocket money gone, and I'll be eating maggie for weeks just to afford it.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this game. I watch every tournament, know all the strategies, can tell you which agents are strongest right now. But playing with default skins while everyone else is flexing their expensive collections? It honestly hurts.

Sometimes I wonder if Riot even remembers that Indian players exist. They set these prices like everyone earns in dollars. A little regional pricing would be amazing! We want to support the game too, but these prices are just impossible for most of us.
